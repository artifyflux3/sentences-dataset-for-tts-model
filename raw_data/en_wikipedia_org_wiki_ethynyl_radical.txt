 You deserve an explanation 

August 17: An important update for readers in the United States. 

Please don't skip this 1-minute read. It's Sunday, August 17, and we're running a short fundraiser to support Wikipedia. If you've lost count of how many times you've visited Wikipedia this year, we hope that means it's given you at least $2.75 of knowledge. Please join the 2% of readers who give what they can to keep this valuable resource ad-free and available for all.

After nearly 25 years, Wikipedia is still the internet we were promised—created by people, not by machines. It's not perfect, but it's not here to push a point of view. It's owned by a non-profit, not a giant technology company or a billionaire.

Most readers donate because Wikipedia is useful to them, others because Wikipedia is more important than ever. If you feel the same, please donate $2.75 now—or consider a monthly gift to help all year. Thank you.

Chemical compound

The **ethynyl radical** (systematically named **λ 3-ethyne** and **hydridodicarbon(_C_—_C_)**) is an [organic compound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_compound "Organic compound") with the [chemical formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_formula "Chemical formula") C≡CH (also written [CCH] or C

2 H). It is a simple molecule that does not occur naturally on Earth but is abundant in the [interstellar medium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_medium "Interstellar medium"). It was first observed by [electron spin resonance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_paramagnetic_resonance "Electron paramagnetic resonance") isolated in a [solid argon matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_isolation "Matrix isolation") at liquid helium temperatures in 1963 by Cochran and coworkers at the [Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_Physics_Laboratory "Applied Physics Laboratory").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethynyl_radical#cite_note-Cochran1964-1) It was first observed in the gas phase by Tucker and coworkers in November 1973 toward the [Orion Nebula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_Nebula "Orion Nebula"), using the [NRAO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Radio_Astronomy_Observatory "National Radio Astronomy Observatory") 11-meter radio telescope.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethynyl_radical#cite_note-Tucker1974-2) It has since been detected in a large variety of interstellar environments, including dense [molecular clouds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_cloud "Molecular cloud"), [bok globules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bok_globule "Bok globule"), [star forming regions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_formation "Star formation"), the shells around [carbon-rich evolved stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_star "Carbon star"), and even in other [galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy "Galaxy").

Astronomical importance
-----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ethynyl_radical&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Astronomical importance")]

Observations of C 2 H can yield a large number of insights into the chemical and physical conditions where it is located. First, the relative abundance of ethynyl is an indication of the carbon-richness of its environment (as opposed to oxygen, which provides an important destruction mechanism).[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethynyl_radical#cite_note-Huggins1984-3) Since there are typically insufficient quantities of C 2 H along a line of sight to make [emission or absorption lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_line "Spectral line") optically thick, derived column densities can be relatively accurate (as opposed to more common molecules like [CO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide "Carbon monoxide"), [NO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide "Nitric oxide"), and [OH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxide "Hydroxide")). Observations of multiple rotational transitions of C 2 H can result in estimates of the local density and temperature. Observations of the deuterated molecule, C 2 D, can test and extend [fractionation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractionation "Fractionation") theories (which explain the enhanced abundance of deuterated molecules in the interstellar medium).[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethynyl_radical#cite_note-Vrtilek1985-4) One of the important indirect uses for observations of the ethynyl radical is the determination of [acetylene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylene "Acetylene") abundances.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethynyl_radical#cite_note-Fuente1998-5) Acetylene (C 2 H 2) does not have a [dipole moment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_dipole_moment "Electric dipole moment"), and therefore pure rotational transitions (typically occurring in the [microwave region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave "Microwave") of the spectrum) are too weak to be observable. Since acetylene provides a dominant formation pathway to ethynyl, observations of the product can yield estimates of the unobservable acetylene. Observations of C 2 H in star-forming regions frequently exhibit shell structures, which implies that it is quickly converted to more complex molecules in the densest regions of a molecular cloud. C 2 H can therefore be used to study the initial conditions at the onset of massive star formation in dense cores.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethynyl_radical#cite_note-Beuther2008-6) Finally, high-spectral-resolution observations of [Zeeman splitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeeman_effect "Zeeman effect") in C 2 H can give information about the magnetic fields in dense clouds, which can augment similar observations that are more commonly done in the simpler [cyano radical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyano_radical "Cyano radical") (CN).[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethynyl_radical#cite_note-Bel1998-7)

Formation and destruction
-------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ethynyl_radical&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Formation and destruction")]

The formation and destruction mechanisms of the ethynyl radical vary widely with its environment. The mechanisms listed below represent the current (as of 2008[[update]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ethynyl_radical&action=edit)) understanding, but other formation and destruction pathways may be possible, or even dominant, in certain situations.

### Formation

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ethynyl_radical&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Formation")]

In the laboratory, C 2 H can be made via [photolysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photolysis "Photolysis") of acetylene (C 2 H 2) or C 2 HCF 3,[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethynyl_radical#cite_note-Fahr2003-8) or in a [glow discharge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glow_discharge "Glow discharge") of a mixture of acetylene and helium.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethynyl_radical#cite_note-M%C3%BCller2000-9) In the envelopes of carbon-rich evolved stars, acetylene is created in the thermal equilibrium in the stellar photosphere. Ethynyl is created as a photodissociation product of the acetylene that is ejected (via strong [stellar winds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_wind "Stellar wind")) into the outer [envelope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumstellar_envelope "Circumstellar envelope") of these stars. In the cold, dense cores of molecular clouds (prior to star formation) where _n_> 10 4 cm−3 and _T_< 20 K, ethynyl is dominantly formed via an electron recombination with the [vinyl radical](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vinyl_radical&action=edit&redlink=1 "Vinyl radical (page does not exist)") (C

2 H+

3).[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethynyl_radical#cite_note-Woodall2007-10) The neutral-neutral reaction of [propynylidyne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propynylidyne "Propynylidyne") (C 3 H) and atomic oxygen also produces ethynyl (and [carbon monoxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide "Carbon monoxide"), CO), though this is typically not a dominant formation mechanism. The dominant creation reactions are listed below.

*   C

2 H+

3 + e− → C 2 H + H + H
*   C

2 H+

3 + e− → C 2 H + H 2
*   CH 3 CCH+ + e− → C 2 H + CH 3
*   C 3 H + O → C 2 H + CO

### Destruction

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ethynyl_radical&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Destruction")]

The destruction of ethynyl is dominantly through neutral-neutral reactions with O 2 (producing carbon monoxide and [formyl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formyl "Formyl"), HCO), or with atomic nitrogen (producing atomic hydrogen and C 2 N). Ion-neutral reactions can also play a role in the destruction of ethynyl, through reactions with HCO+ and [H+ 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trihydrogen_cation "Trihydrogen cation"). The dominant destruction reactions are listed below.

*   C 2 H + O 2 → HCO + CO[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]
*   C 2 H + N → C 2 N + H
*   C 2 H + HCO+ → C

2 H+

2 + CO
*   C 2 H + H+

3 → C

2 H+

2 + H 2

Method of observation
---------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ethynyl_radical&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Method of observation")]

The ethynyl radical is observed in the microwave portion of the spectrum via pure rotational transitions. In its ground electronic and vibrational state, the nuclei are [collinear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_(geometry) "Line (geometry)"), and the molecule has a permanent dipole moment estimated to be _μ_ = 0.8[D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debye_(unit) "Debye (unit)") = 2.7×10−30 C·m.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethynyl_radical#cite_note-Tucker1974-2) The ground vibrational and electronic (vibronic) state exhibits a simple [rigid rotor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigid_rotor#The_quantum_mechanical_linear_rigid_rotor "Rigid rotor")-type rotational spectrum. However, each rotational state exhibits [fine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine_structure "Fine structure") and [hyperfine structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperfine_structure "Hyperfine structure"), due to the spin-orbit and electron-nucleus interactions, respectively. The ground rotational state is split into two hyperfine states, and the higher rotational states are each split into four hyperfine states. Selection rules prohibit all but six transitions between the ground and the first excited rotational state. Four of the six components were observed by Tucker _et al._ in 1974,[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethynyl_radical#cite_note-Tucker1974-2) the initial astronomical detection of ethynyl, and 4 years later, all six components were observed, which provided the final piece of evidence confirming the initial identification of the previously unassigned lines.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethynyl_radical#cite_note-Tucker1978-11) Transitions between two adjacent higher-lying rotational states have 11 hyperfine components. The molecular constants of the ground vibronic state are tabulated below.

Isotopologues
-------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ethynyl_radical&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Isotopologues")]

Three [isotopologues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotopologue "Isotopologue") of the 12 C 12 CH molecule have been observed in the interstellar medium. The change in molecular mass is associated with a shift in the energy levels and therefore the transition frequencies associated with the molecule. The molecular constants of the ground vibronic state, and the approximate transition frequency for the lowest 5 rotational transitions are given for each of the isotopologues in the table below.
