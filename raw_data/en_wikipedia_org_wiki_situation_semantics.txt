According to Situations and Attitudes , meaning is a relation between a discourse  situation, a connective situation and a described situation. The original theory of Situations and Attitudes soon ran into foundational difficulties. A reformulation based on Peter Aczel 's non-well-founded set theory [ 2 ] was proposed by Barwise before this approach to the subject petered out in the early 1990s.

HPSG [ edit ] Situation semantics is the first semantic theory that was used in head-driven phrase structure grammar (HPSG).

[ 3 ] Kratzer [ edit ] Barwise and Perry's system was a top-down approach which foundered on practical issues which were early identified by Angelika Kratzer and others. She subsequently developed a considerable body of theory bottom-up by addressing a variety of issues in the areas of context dependency in discourse and the syntax–semantics interface .

[ 4 ] Because of its practical nature and ongoing development this body of work "with possible situations as parts of possible worlds , now has much more influence than Barwise and Perry’s ideas".
