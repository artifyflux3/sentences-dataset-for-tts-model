_**Evolution**_ (stylized as _**EVOLution**_) is the second [studio album](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_album "Studio album") by American singer [Sabrina Carpenter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabrina_Carpenter "Sabrina Carpenter"), released on October 14, 2016, by [Hollywood Records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_Records "Hollywood Records").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_(Sabrina_Carpenter_album)#cite_note-albumrelease-1) Carpenter began recording the album in 2015, shortly after the launch of her first project, _[Eyes Wide Open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyes\_Wide\_Open\_(Sabrina\_Carpenter\_album) "Eyes Wide Open (Sabrina Carpenter album)")_ until 2016. Musically, _Evolution_ is a [dance-pop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance-pop "Dance-pop") record,[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_(Sabrina_Carpenter_album)#cite_note-AllMusic-2) which departs from the [folk-pop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk-pop "Folk-pop") and [teen pop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teen_pop "Teen pop") sound of its predecessor. _Evolution_ received positive reviews from [music critics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_journalism "Music journalism") and reached number 28 on the US [_Billboard_ 200](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_200 "Billboard 200") chart.

"Smoke and Fire" was originally intended to be the [lead single](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_single "Lead single") from _Evolution_, but it was eventually excluded from the track listing; Carpenter later said that this was due to the "evolution" occurring after the song.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_(Sabrina_Carpenter_album)#cite_note-3) Carpenter also said the track was "was the first story that I was waiting to tell out of the many stories from the second album",[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_(Sabrina_Carpenter_album)#cite_note-4) and that she intended for it to be the first single because she felt that it was a great transition from _[Eyes Wide Open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyes\_Wide\_Open\_(Sabrina\_Carpenter\_album) "Eyes Wide Open (Sabrina Carpenter album)")_.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_(Sabrina_Carpenter_album)#cite_note-5) According to Carpenter, the song's music video "show[s] flashback memories of an innocent love story in the midst of post breakup beauty and heartbreak."[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_(Sabrina_Carpenter_album)#cite_note-6)

"On Purpose" was released as the lead single from _Evolution_ on July 29, 2016.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_(Sabrina_Carpenter_album)#cite_note-7)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_(Sabrina_Carpenter_album)#cite_note-8)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_(Sabrina_Carpenter_album)#cite_note-9) "Thumbs" impacted [Top 40 radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contemporary_hit_radio "Contemporary hit radio") as the second single from the album on January 3, 2017.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_(Sabrina_Carpenter_album)#cite_note-10) The album was made available for pre-order alongside the first [promotional single](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promotional_single "Promotional single"), "All We Have Is Love", released on September 23, 2016.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_(Sabrina_Carpenter_album)#cite_note-preorder-11) "Run and Hide" was released as the second promotional single on September 30, 2016.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_(Sabrina_Carpenter_album)#cite_note-12)

To promoted the album, Carpenter embarked on the [Evolution Tour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_Tour "Evolution Tour") through the United States from October to December 2016.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_(Sabrina_Carpenter_album)#cite_note-13) She also embarked on [The De-Tour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_De-Tour "The De-Tour"), in which she toured both the United States and Canada in July and August 2017, featuring [Alex Aiono](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Aiono "Alex Aiono") and [New Hope Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hope_Club "New Hope Club") as special guests.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_(Sabrina_Carpenter_album)#cite_note-14) On April 18, 2017, Carpenter performed "Thumbs" on _[The Late Late Show with James Corden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Late\_Late\_Show\_with\_James\_Corden "The Late Late Show with James Corden")_.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_(Sabrina_Carpenter_album)#cite_note-15)

In 2017, Carpenter performed "Thumbs", "On Purpose", and "Feels Like Loneliness" at the [Pandora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandora_(service) "Pandora (service)") Headquarters, with all three performances later released under the title the "Pandora Sessions" on both Pandora and [Spotify](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify "Spotify").[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_(Sabrina_Carpenter_album)#cite_note-pandora1-16)

_Evolution_ was met with positive reviews, with critics complimenting Carpenter's sense of maturity and growth on the album in comparison to her debut album. Christine M. Sellers of _The Celebrity Cafe_ wrote that Carpenter "proves she's not just another Disney darling transitioning through her teenage years" and that the album "showcases Carpenter's growth as both a songwriter and a vocalist".[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_(Sabrina_Carpenter_album)#cite_note-The_Celebrity_Cafe-18) Brittany Goldfield Rodrigues of _Andpop_ gave the album 3.8 thumbs up, saying that "with _Evolution_, Sabrina is showing a mature musical side, willing to experiment with [techno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Techno_music "Techno music") beats, lyrics and what she can do vocally. She provides an interesting [indie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indie_music "Indie music") yet [synth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synth "Synth") take on [pop music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music "Pop music"), and has clearly found a unique sound that she shines in, that separates her from the rest".[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_(Sabrina_Carpenter_album)#cite_note-Andpop-17) Matt Collar from [AllMusic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AllMusic "AllMusic") gave the album a rating of 3.5 out of 5, noting its [dance-pop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance-pop "Dance-pop") sound and describing it as a "mix of heartfelt [acoustic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_music "Acoustic music") balladry, [R&B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contemporary_R%26B "Contemporary R&B")-influenced [pop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music "Pop music"), and [dance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_music "Dance music")-oriented anthems.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_(Sabrina_Carpenter_album)#cite_note-AllMusic-2)
