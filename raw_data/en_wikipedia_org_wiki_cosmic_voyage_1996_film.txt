Synopsis [ edit ] Cosmic Voyage has a format similar to Eva Szasz's Cosmic Zoom , and Charles and Ray Eames 's classic Powers of Ten educational video. All were based on the 1957 book Cosmic View by Dutch educator Kees Boeke .

Cosmic Voyage takes viewers on a journey through forty-two orders of magnitude , beginning at a celebration in Venice, Italy and slowly zooming out into the edge of the observable universe . Then the view descends back to Earth, into a raindrop in Belgium , down to the level of subatomic particles ( quarks ).

In addition, the film offers some brief insight on the Big Bang theory, black holes , and the development of the Solar System . It also simulates a journey through Fermilab 's Tevatron particle accelerator in Chicago , where an atom collision is depicted.

Production [ edit ] Parts of the film were shot in the Canyonlands in Utah.

[ 2 ] Awards [ edit ] Cosmic Voyage was nominated for a 1997 Academy Award under the category of Best Documentary Short Subject .
