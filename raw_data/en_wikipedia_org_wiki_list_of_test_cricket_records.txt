Donald Bradman , holder of several Test batting records including highest batting average Sachin Tendulkar , the leading run-scorer and century maker in Test cricket Muttiah Muralitharan , the highest wicket-taker in Test cricket George Lohmann , the holder of best bowling average in Test cricket Test cricket is played between international cricket teams who are Full Members of the International Cricket Council (ICC).

[ 1 ] Unlike One Day Internationals , Test matches consist of two innings per team, with no limit in the number of overs .

[ 2 ] Test cricket is first-class cricket , so statistics and records set in Test matches are also counted toward first-class records. The duration of Tests, currently limited to five days, has varied through Test history, ranging from three days to timeless matches .

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] The earliest match now recognised as a Test was played between England and Australia in March 1877; [ 5 ] since then there have been over 2,000 Tests played by 13 teams. The frequency of Tests has steadily increased partly because of the increase in the number of Test-playing countries, and partly as cricket boards seek to maximise their revenue.

[ 6 ] Cricket is, by its nature, capable of generating large numbers of records and statistics .

[ 7 ] This list details the most significant team and individual records in Test cricket.

As of June 2025 [update] , the most successful team in Test cricket, in terms of both wins and win percentage, is Australia, having won 419 of their 874 Tests (47.94%). Excluding teams who have only played a small number of Tests, the least successful team is Zimbabwe .

Australian Donald Bradman , widely considered the greatest batsman of all time, [ 8 ] [ 9 ] holds several personal and partnership records. He scored the most runs in a series, has the most double centuries and was a part of the record 5th wicket partnership . His most significant record is his batting average of 99.94. One of cricket's most famous statistics, [ 10 ] [ 11 ] it still stands almost 40 runs higher than any other batsman's career average. Don Bradman is the only player in the world to have scored 5000 runs against a single opposition: 5028 runs against England.

[ 12 ] In the Manchester Test of 1956, England spin bowler Jim Laker took 19 wickets for 90 runs (19–90) which set not only the Test record for best match figures but also the first-class one.

[ 13 ] In taking 10–53 in the second innings he became the first bowler to capture ten wickets in a Test match innings, and his analysis remains the best innings figures. Indian leg spinner Anil Kumble was the second bowler to take 10 wickets in an innings, claiming 10–74 against Pakistan in 1999.

[ 14 ] In December 2021, New Zealand spinner, Ajaz Patel became the third bowler to take 10 wickets in an innings.

[ 15 ] West Indies batsman Brian Lara has the highest individual score in Test cricket: he scored 400 not out against England in 2004 to surpass the innings of 380 by Matthew Hayden six months earlier. Lara had held the record before Hayden, with a score of 375 against England 10 years earlier.

[ 16 ] Pakistan's Misbah-ul-Haq holds the record of the fastest Test half century, scoring 50 runs from 21 balls. The record for the fastest Test century is held by New Zealand's Brendon McCullum , who scored 100 runs from 54 balls in his final Test match.

The trend of countries playing more Test matches in the modern era means that the aggregate lists are dominated by modern players.

Sri Lankan spinner Muttiah Muralitharan became the highest Test wicket-taker in December 2007, when he passed Shane Warne 's total of 708 wickets.

[ 17 ] Within a year, the equivalent batting record of highest run-scorer had also changed hands: Sachin Tendulkar surpassed the tally of 11,953 runs by Brian Lara.

[ 18 ] The record for most dismissals by a wicket-keeper is held by Mark Boucher of South Africa [ 19 ] while the record for most catches by a fielder is held by Joe Root .

[ 20 ] Listing criteria In general the top five are listed in each category (except when there is a tie for the last place among the five, when all the tied record holders are noted).

Listing notation Team notation (300–3) indicates that a team scored 300 runs for three wickets and the innings was closed, either due to a successful run chase or if no playing time remained (300–3 d) indicates that a team scored 300 runs for three wickets, and declared its innings closed (300) indicates that a team scored 300 runs and was all out Batting notation (100) indicates that a batsman scored 100 runs and was out (100*) indicates that a batsman scored 100 runs and was not out Bowling notation (5–100) indicates that a bowler has captured 5 wickets while conceding 100 runs Currently playing † indicates a current Test cricketer Seasons Domestic cricket seasons in Australia, New Zealand , South Africa, India , Pakistan , Sri Lanka , Bangladesh , Zimbabwe and the West Indies may span two calendar years, and are by convention said to be played in ( e.g.

) "2008–09". A cricket season in England is described as a single year.

e.g.

"2009". An international Test series may be for a much shorter duration, and Cricinfo treats this issue by stating "any series or matches which began between May and September of any given year will appear in the relevant single year season and any that began between October and April will appear in the relevant cross-year season".

[ 21 ] In the record tables, a two-year span generally indicates that the record was set within a domestic season in one of the above named countries.
