With over 33,000 students at four different faculties: law, humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences, it is one of the largest universities in Scandinavia .

Stockholm University was granted university status in 1960, making it the fourth oldest Swedish university . As with other public universities in Sweden, Stockholm University's mission includes teaching and research anchored in society at large.

[ 3 ] History [ edit ] The initiative for the formation of Stockholm University was taken by the Stockholm City Council. The process was completed after a decision in December 1865 regarding the establishment of a fund and a committee to "establish a higher education institution in the capital".

[ 4 ] The nine members of the committee were respected and prominent citizens whose work had helped the evolution of science and society.

[ 5 ] The next important step was taken in October 1869, when the Stockholm University College Association was established.

[ 6 ] Several members of the committee became members of the association – including Professor Pehr Henrik Malmsten.

[ 7 ] The association's mission was to establish a college in Stockholm and would "not be dissolved until the college came into being and its future could be considered secure." The memorandum of the Stockholm University College was adopted in May 1877, and in the autumn semester of the following year, actual operations began.

In 1878, the university college Stockholms högskola started its operations with a series of lectures on natural sciences, open to curious citizens (a tradition still upheld by yearly publicly open lectures).  Notable in the university's early history is the appointment of Sofia Kovalevskaya to hold a chair in the mathematics department in 1889, making her the third female professor in Europe. In 1904 the college became an official degree-granting institution.

Fredrik Blom 's house at Experimentalfältet, now used for the central administration of Stockholm University In 1960, the college was granted university status, becoming Sweden's fourth state university. The university premises were situated in central Stockholm at Observatorielunden but increased enrollment resulted in a lack of space, which required the university campus to be shifted to a bigger facility. Since 1970 most of the university operations are located at the main campus at Frescati north of the city center, the former Experimentalfältet, previously used by the Royal Swedish Academy of Agriculture and Forestry .

Organisation [ edit ] Stockholm University is a state agency and is governed by decisions taken by the government and parliament. The university has the right, within the limits the government provides, to decide on many issues such as their internal organization, educational provision and the admission of students.

Intra-university bodies [ edit ] The University Board is the university's highest governing body. The board is responsible for the university's mission as a government agency and for following the requirements of laws and regulations. The board reports to the government. It consists of eight external members (including the chairman and vice-chairman), four business representatives from the university with two group deputies and three student representatives (one graduate student representative) with one deputy. The University Board is above the rector who is the head of the agency and has operational responsibility for all operations. The rector has a pro rector to replace him/her if necessary.

There are two area boards at the university, the Area board of science and the Area board of humanities, law and social sciences . They are headed by a vice rector . The area boards are responsible for strategic planning of education and research, coordination of faculty teaching, research and internal and external collaboration.

After the area boards, the faculty boards are the highest decision-making bodies at the faculty level. The faculty boards consists of the dean, the assistant dean, other business representatives and student representatives. The deans are appointed by the president after proposal by choice within the faculty.

After faculties, decisions are taken at the departmental level, where each department has a department head who manages and makes decisions together with the departmental board .

The University administration is the preparation and service organization for the University Board, rector and other decision-making bodies, and it is led by the executive director. The university administration has a number of units, for example, finance department, IT department, HR department and the student section. There are also units for strategy, planning and communications.

The Executive Director is the most senior official at Stockholm University and decides on matters including the university administration's organization and finances.

International collaboration [ edit ] The university is an active member of the University of the Arctic .

[ 8 ] UArctic is an international cooperative network based in the Circumpolar Arctic region, consisting of more than 200 universities, colleges, and other organizations with an interest in promoting education and research in the Arctic region.

[ 9 ] The university also participates in UArctic's mobility program north2north. The aim of that program is to enable students of member institutions to study in different parts of the North.

[ 10 ] Departments, institutes and centers [ edit ] Education and research at Stockholm University is carried out within the natural sciences and the humanities/social sciences. Within these fields, there are four faculties with 56 departments, institutes and centers within the humanities, law, natural sciences and social sciences. Research and training also takes place at a number of centers and institutes with a separate governing board, but that organisationally belong to a department.

[ 11 ] Courses and programmes [ edit ] This section needs expansion . You can help by adding to it .

( August 2019 ) Stockholm University offers courses at both undergraduate [ 12 ] and advanced level.

[ 13 ] There are 190 study programmes in total, including 75 master's programmes taught in English, and 1,700 courses to choose from within human science and science. Students can choose between studying one or more free-standing courses, that each may last between five weeks and one semester, or apply for a full study programme. Stockholm university offers 4 Bachelor Programmes taught in English, which are the Bachelor´s Programme in Business, Ethics and Sustainability; Bachelor Programme in Latin America Studies; Bachelor´s Programme in International Business and Politics and the Bachelor´s Programme in Earth Science, Distance Learning.

[ 14 ] Besides the programmes themselves, the university also offers opportunities for foreign exchange studies during the third year of a bachelor's degree programme. The university has cooperative agreements with more than 100 universities worldwide.

[ 15 ] Research [ edit ] The university's researchers engage in governmental investigations, are active in the media, provide responses to proposed legislation and are included in several Nobel committees and international expert bodies.

[ 16 ] Field stations [ edit ] Askö Laboratory Stockholm University Marine Research center (SMF) provides "Askö Laboratory", where Research on ecosystems, ecology and the impact of human interference is carried out. The field station was built in 1961 by Professor Lars Silén, Head of the Department of Zoology, and is now established as a renowned marine research center.

[ 17 ] Tarfala Tarfala research station belongs to the Department of Physical Geography. The station is located 1135 meters above sea level in Tarfaladalen, on the east side of Kebnekaise in arctic / alpine surroundings and conducts glaciological, hydrological, meteorological and climatological research. The station has the capacity to accommodate groups of up to 25 people and the staff consists of 2–5 people.

[ 18 ] Tovetorp Tovetorp Zoological Research Station belongs to the Department of Zoology, and is located about 95 km southwest of Stockholm. It conducts research and training activities in ecology and ethology. Every year Tovetorp is visited by up to 600 students who live and study between 2–10 days on the station. On the research side, over 20 people work today with different research projects. The number of employees are currently 6 people.

[ 19 ] Student unions [ edit ] Prior to 2008, Stockholm University had only one student union called Stockholm University Student Union (Stockholm universitets studentkår, SUS) . However, since 2008 the computer and system science students [ 20 ] and the teacher students have their own, independent, student unions called DISK and "The Teacher's College's Student Union" (Lärarhögskolans studentkår) . The law students also have their own student union, as do journalism students ( Studentkåren vid JMK ).

The future of the Teacher's College's Student Union is however not entirely safe, as Stockholm University's Student Union has declared it will begin talks with the Teacher's College's Student Union on transferring its members to it, as it already has a teacher's division. In contrast to common belief, DISK is not an abbreviation.
