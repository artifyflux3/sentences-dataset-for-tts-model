This series is also related to, though not always entirely consistent with, the 8 collections and 5 novels subtitled "Tales of the Biotech Revolution", see below.

The term "emortality", intended to indicate near-immortality as opposed to absolute immortality, is acknowledged by Stableford (in the acknowledgments to volume 3, Dark Ararat ) to have been coined by Alvin Silverstein in his 1979 book, Conquest of Death .

In the introduction to his 2007 collection, The Tree of Life and Other Tales of the Biotech Revolution , Stableford describes this series as "tracking the potential effects of possible developments in biotechnology on the evolution of global society. [It can be considered] a modified version of the future history mapped out in The Third Millennium: A History of the World AD 2000–3000 (Sidgwick & Jackson 1985, written in collaboration with David Langford ).

"The broad sweep of this future history envisages a large-scale economic and ecological collapse in the 21st-century brought about by global warming and other factors, followed by the emergence of a global society designed to accommodate human longevity (although that is not necessarily obvious in stories set in advance of the Crash)."
