For secular possessions of the church, see Temporalities .

In philosophy , temporality refers to the idea of a linear progression of past, present, and future. The term is frequently used, however, in the context of critiques of commonly held ideas of linear time . In social sciences , temporality is studied with respect to the human perception of time and the social organization of time.

[ 1 ] The perception of time in Western thought underwent significant changes in the three hundred years between the Middle Ages and modernity.

[ 2 ] Examples in continental philosophy of philosophers raising questions of temporality include Edmund Husserl 's analysis of internal time consciousness, Martin Heidegger 's Being and Time , J. M. E. McTaggart 's article " The Unreality of Time ", George Herbert Mead 's Philosophy of the Present , and Jacques Derrida 's criticisms of Husserl's analysis.

Temporality is "deeply intertwined with the rhetorical act of harnessing and subverting power in the unfolding struggle for justice." [ 3 ] Temporalities, particularly in European settler colonialism , have been observed in critical theory as a tool for both subjugation and oppression of Indigenous communities, and Native resistance to that oppression.

[ 4 ] Temporal turn [ edit ] In historiography , questioning periodization , and as a further development after the spatial turn , social sciences have started re-investigating time and its different social understanding.

[ 5 ] Temporal turn social science investigates different understandings of time at different times and locations, giving rise to concepts such as timespace where time and space are thought together.
