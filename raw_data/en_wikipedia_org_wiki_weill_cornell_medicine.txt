History [ edit ] 19th century [ edit ] See also: History of Cornell University § Medical education Weill Cornell Medicine Weill Cornell Medicine's facade on the East River Cornell Medical College's Stimson Hall on the main campus in Ithaca in 1910 The Cornell Medical College was founded on April 14, 1898, with an endowment by Col.

Oliver H. Payne . The college was established in New York City because Ithaca , where the Cornell main campus is located, was deemed too small to offer adequate clinical training opportunities.

James Ewing was the first professor of clinical pathology at the school, and for a while the only full-time professor.

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] 20th century [ edit ] The college founded the medical fraternity, Phi Delta Epsilon , on October 13, 1904.

[ 9 ] A branch of the medical school operated in Stimson Hall on the main campus. The two-year Ithaca course paralleled the first two years of the New York school. The Ithaca location closed in 1938 due to declining enrollment.

The school became affiliated with New York Hospital, now NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital , in 1913.

[ 1 ] The institutions opened a joint hospital-educational campus in Yorkville in 1932.

[ 1 ] In 1927, William Payne Whitney 's $27 million donation led to the building of the Payne Whitney Psychiatric Clinic , which became the name for Cornell's large psychiatric effort. Its Training School for Nurses became affiliated with the university in 1942, operating as the Cornell Nursing School until it closed in 1979.

[ 10 ] In 1936, the Swiss professor and psychiatrist Oskar Diethelm [ 11 ] contributed a collection of more than 10,000 titles related to the history of psychiatry, helping to build up the Oskar Diethelm Historical Library.

[ 12 ] [ 13 ] The Cornell University Medical College was renamed the " Joan and Sanford I. Weill Medical College of Cornell University " after then- Citigroup chairman Sanford I. Weill pledged a $100 million donation to Cornell University for its biomedical research in 1998.

[ 5 ] 21st century [ edit ] In 2015, the school was renamed Weill Cornell Medicine .

[ 14 ] On September 16, 2019, Augustine M.K. Choi announced Weill Cornell Medicine would make the cost of attendance free for all students who qualify for financial aid, made possible by a $160 million gift from The Starr Foundation, directed by Weill Cornell Medicine overseer Maurice R. Greenberg , in partnership with gifts from Joan and Board of Overseers Chairman Emeritus Sanford I. Weill.

[ 15 ] In March 2024, Augustine M.K. Choi, professor and former Dean of Weill Cornell Medicine, was accused of altering data for two decades in his research on animals.
