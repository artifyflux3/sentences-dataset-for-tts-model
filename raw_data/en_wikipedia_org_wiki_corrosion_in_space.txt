 You deserve an explanation 

August 17: An important update for readers in the United States. 

Please don't skip this 1-minute read. It's Sunday, August 17, and we're running a short fundraiser to support Wikipedia. If you've lost count of how many times you've visited Wikipedia this year, we hope that means it's given you at least $2.75 of knowledge. Please join the 2% of readers who give what they can to keep this valuable resource ad-free and available for all.

After nearly 25 years, Wikipedia is still the internet we were promised—created by people, not by machines. It's not perfect, but it's not here to push a point of view. It's owned by a non-profit, not a giant technology company or a billionaire.

Most readers donate because Wikipedia is useful to them, others because Wikipedia is more important than ever. If you feel the same, please donate $2.75 now—or consider a monthly gift to help all year. Thank you.

Corrosion of materials occurring in outer space

**Corrosion in space** is the [corrosion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrosion "Corrosion") of materials occurring in [outer space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_space "Outer space"). Instead of [moisture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moisture "Moisture") and [oxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen "Oxygen") acting as the primary corrosion causes, the materials exposed to outer space are subjected to [vacuum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum "Vacuum"), bombardment by [ultraviolet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet "Ultraviolet") and [X-rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray "X-ray"), [solar energetic particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_energetic_particles "Solar energetic particles") (mostly [electrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron "Electron") and [protons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton "Proton") from [solar wind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_wind "Solar wind")), and electromagnetic radiation.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrosion_in_space#cite_note-:0-1) In the upper layers of the atmosphere (between 90–800 km), the atmospheric atoms, ions, and [free radicals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry) "Radical (chemistry)"), most notably [atomic oxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_oxygen "Atomic oxygen"), play a major role. The concentration of atomic oxygen depends on altitude and [solar activity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_weather "Space weather"), as the bursts of ultraviolet radiation cause [photodissociation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photodissociation "Photodissociation") of molecular oxygen.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrosion_in_space#cite_note-2) Between 160 and 560 km, the atmosphere consists of about 90% atomic oxygen.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrosion_in_space#cite_note-3)

Materials
---------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Corrosion_in_space&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Materials")]

Corrosion in space has the highest impact on spacecraft with moving parts. Early satellites tended to develop problems with seizing bearings. Now the bearings are coated with a thin layer of [gold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold "Gold").

Different materials resist corrosion in space differently. Electrolytes in batteries or cooling loops can cause galvanic corrosion, general corrosion, and stress corrosion.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrosion_in_space#cite_note-:0-1)[Aluminium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium "Aluminium") is slowly eroded by atomic oxygen, while [gold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold "Gold") and [platinum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platinum "Platinum") are highly corrosion-resistant. Gold-coated foils and thin layers of gold on exposed surfaces are therefore used to protect the spacecraft from the harsh environment. Thin layers of [silicon dioxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_dioxide "Silicon dioxide") deposited on the surfaces can also protect metals from the effects of atomic oxygen; e.g., the [Starshine 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starshine_(satellite) "Starshine (satellite)") satellite aluminium front mirrors were protected that way. However, the protective layers are subject to erosion by [micrometeorites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micrometeorites "Micrometeorites").

Silver builds up a layer of silver oxide, which tends to flake off and has no protective function; such gradual erosion of silver interconnects of solar cells was found to be the cause of some observed in-orbit failures.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrosion_in_space#cite_note-envdeg-4)

Many [plastics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic "Plastic") are considerably sensitive to atomic oxygen and ionizing radiation. Coatings resistant to atomic oxygen are a common protection method, especially for plastics. [Silicone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicone "Silicone")-based [paints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paint "Paint") and coatings are frequently employed, due to their excellent resistance to radiation and atomic oxygen.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrosion_in_space#cite_note-5) However, the silicone durability is somewhat limited, as the surface exposed to atomic oxygen is converted to [silica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silica "Silica") which is brittle and tends to crack.

Solving corrosion
-----------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Corrosion_in_space&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Solving corrosion")]

The process of space corrosion is being actively investigated. One of the efforts aims to design a sensor based on [zinc oxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc_oxide "Zinc oxide"), able to measure the amount of atomic oxygen in the vicinity of the spacecraft; the sensor relies on drop of electrical conductivity of zinc oxide as it absorbs further oxygen. [_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

Other problems
--------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Corrosion_in_space&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Other problems")]

The [outgassing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outgassing "Outgassing") of volatile silicones on [low Earth orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit "Low Earth orbit") devices leads to presence of a cloud of contaminants around the spacecraft. Together with atomic oxygen bombardment, this may lead to gradual deposition of thin layers of carbon-containing silicon dioxide. Their poor transparency is a concern in case of optical systems and [solar panels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photovoltaic_module "Photovoltaic module"). Deposits of up to several micrometers were observed after 10 years of service on the solar panels of the [Mir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mir "Mir") space station.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrosion_in_space#cite_note-6)

Other sources of problems for structures subjected to outer space are erosion and redeposition of the materials by [sputtering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputtering "Sputtering") caused by fast atoms and [micrometeoroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micrometeoroid "Micrometeoroid"). Another major concern, though of non-corrosive kind, is [material fatigue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_fatigue "Material fatigue") caused by cyclical heating and cooling and associated thermal expansion mechanical stresses.
