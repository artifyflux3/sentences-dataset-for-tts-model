'the man with two thin legs', [ 1 ] Amharic : ዱል-ሱወይቃታይን ) is a figure mentioned in the hadith of the Islamic prophet Muhammad , [ 1 ] according to which a group of Abyssinian ( Ethiopian ) men are destined to permanently destroy the Ka‘aba at the end of times and remove its treasure. It will be dismantled brick-by-brick, therefore in a peaceful manner. At this time faith in God will have disappeared, so the destruction will go unnoticed.

[ 1 ] Abd Allah ibn Amr ibn al-As and Ibn Kathir interpreted that this will occur after the second coming of Yeshua ( Isa ) (AKA Jesus Christ).

[ 2 ] References to this are recorded in all six traditional Sunni compilations of hadith, the Kutub al-Sitta , including the earliest and the most revered ones, namely Sahih al-Bukhari and Sahih Muslim .

[ 3 ] The tradition is likely related to the Year of the Elephant , when the Axumite general Abraha is said to have attacked Mecca.

[ 4 ] Following the Fifth Crusade (1217–1221), this tradition was transferred to Europe when Bishop Oliver of Paderborn 's Historia Damiatina described a Nubian king as an omen indicating the end of Islam.
