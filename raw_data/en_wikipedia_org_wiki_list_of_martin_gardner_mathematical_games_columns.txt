Over a period of 24 years (January  1957 – December 1980), Martin Gardner wrote 288 consecutive monthly "Mathematical Games" columns for Scientific American magazine. During the next 5 + 1 ⁄ 2 years, until June 1986, Gardner wrote 9 more columns, bringing his total to 297. During this period other authors wrote most of the columns. In 1981, Gardner's column alternated with a new column by Douglas Hofstadter called " Metamagical Themas " (an anagram of "Mathematical Games").

[ 1 ] The table below lists Gardner's columns.

[ 2 ] Twelve of Gardner's columns provided the cover art for that month's magazine, indicated by "[cover]" in the table with a hyperlink to the cover.
