It is named after Curtis Callan , Steven Giddings , Jeffrey A. Harvey and Andrew Strominger , who published on it in 1992.

[ 1 ] Overview [ edit ] General relativity is a highly nonlinear model, and as such, its 3+1D version is usually too complicated to analyze in detail. In 3+1D and higher, propagating gravitational waves exist, but not in 2+1D or 1+1D. In 2+1D, general relativity becomes a topological field theory with no local degrees of freedom, and all 1+1D models are locally flat . However, a slightly more complicated generalization of general relativity which includes dilatons will turn the 2+1D model into one admitting mixed propagating dilaton-gravity waves, as well as making the 1+1D model geometrically nontrivial locally.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] The 1+1D model still does not admit any propagating gravitational (or dilaton) degrees of freedom, but with the addition of matter fields, it becomes a simplified, but still nontrivial model. With other numbers of dimensions, a dilaton-gravity coupling can always be rescaled away by a conformal rescaling of the metric, converting the Jordan frame to the Einstein frame . But not in two dimensions, because the conformal weight of the dilaton is now 0. The metric in this case is more amenable to analytical solutions than the general 3+1D case. And of course, 0+1D models cannot capture any nontrivial aspect of relativity because there is no space at all.

This class of models retains just enough complexity to include among its solutions black holes , their formation, FRW cosmological models, gravitational singularities , etc. In the quantized version of such models with matter fields, Hawking radiation also shows up, just as in higher-dimensional models.

Action [ edit ] A very specific choice of couplings and interactions leads to the CGHS model.

S = 1 2 π π ∫ ∫ d 2 x − − g { e − − 2 ϕ ϕ [ R + 4 ( ∇ ∇ ϕ ϕ ) 2 + 4 λ λ 2 ] − − ∑ ∑ i = 1 N 1 2 ( ∇ ∇ f i ) 2 } {\displaystyle S={\frac {1}{2\pi }}\int d^{2}x\,{\sqrt {-g}}\left\{e^{-2\phi }\left[R+4\left(\nabla \phi \right)^{2}+4\lambda ^{2}\right]-\sum _{i=1}^{N}{\frac {1}{2}}\left(\nabla f_{i}\right)^{2}\right\}} where g is the metric tensor , ϕ ϕ {\displaystyle \phi } is the dilaton field, f i are the matter fields, and λ 2 is the cosmological constant . In particular, the cosmological constant is nonzero, and the matter fields are massless real scalars.

This specific choice is classically integrable , but still not amenable to an exact quantum solution. It is also the action for Non-critical string theory and dimensional reduction of higher-dimensional model. It also distinguishes it from Jackiw–Teitelboim gravity and Liouville gravity , which are entirely different models.

The matter field only couples to the causal structure , and in the light-cone gauge ds 2 = − e 2ρ du,dv , has the simple generic form f i ( u , v ) = A i ( u ) + B i ( v ) {\displaystyle f_{i}\left(u,v\right)=A_{i}\left(u\right)+B_{i}\left(v\right)} , with a factorization between left- and right-movers.

The Raychaudhuri equations are e − − 2 ϕ ϕ ( − − 2 ϕ ϕ , v v + 4 ρ ρ , v ϕ ϕ , v ) + f i , v f i , v / 2 = 0 {\displaystyle e^{-2\phi }\left(-2\phi _{,vv}+4\rho _{,v}\phi _{,v}\right)+f_{i,v}f_{i,v}/2=0} and e − − 2 ϕ ϕ ( − − 2 ϕ ϕ , u u + 4 ρ ρ , u ϕ ϕ , u ) + f i , u f i , u / 2 = 0 {\displaystyle e^{-2\phi }\left(-2\phi _{,uu}+4\rho _{,u}\phi _{,u}\right)+f_{i,u}f_{i,u}/2=0} .

The dilaton evolves according to ( e − − 2 ϕ ϕ ) , u v = − − λ λ 2 e − − 2 ϕ ϕ e 2 ρ ρ {\displaystyle \left(e^{-2\phi }\right)_{,uv}=-\lambda ^{2}e^{-2\phi }e^{2\rho }} , while the metric evolves according to 2 ρ ρ , u v − − 4 ϕ ϕ , u v + 4 ϕ ϕ , u ϕ ϕ , v + λ λ 2 e 2 ρ ρ = 0 {\displaystyle 2\rho _{,uv}-4\phi _{,uv}+4\phi _{,u}\phi _{,v}+\lambda ^{2}e^{2\rho }=0} .

The conformal anomaly due to matter induces a Liouville term in the effective action .

Black hole [ edit ] A vacuum black hole solution is given by d s 2 = − − ( M λ λ − − λ λ 2 u v ) − − 1 d u d v {\displaystyle ds^{2}=-\left({\frac {M}{\lambda }}-\lambda ^{2}uv\right)^{-1}du\,dv} e − − 2 ϕ ϕ = M λ λ − − λ λ 2 u v {\displaystyle e^{-2\phi }={\frac {M}{\lambda }}-\lambda ^{2}uv} , where M is the ADM mass.
Singularities appear at uv = λ −3 M .

The masslessness of the matter fields allow a black hole to completely evaporate away via Hawking radiation . In fact, this model was originally studied to shed light upon the black hole information paradox .
