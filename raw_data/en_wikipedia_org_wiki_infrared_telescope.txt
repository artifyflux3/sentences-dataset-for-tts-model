[SOFIA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOFIA "SOFIA") was an infrared telescope in an aircraft, allowing high altitude observations

An **infrared telescope** is a [telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telescope "Telescope") that uses [infrared](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared "Infrared") light to detect celestial bodies. Infrared light is one of several types of radiation present in the [electromagnetic spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum "Electromagnetic spectrum").

All celestial objects with a temperature above [absolute zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_zero "Absolute zero") emit some form of [electromagnetic radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation "Electromagnetic radiation").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_telescope#cite_note-1) In order to study the universe, scientists use several different types of telescopes to detect these different types of emitted radiation in the electromagnetic spectrum. Some of these are [gamma ray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_ray "Gamma ray"), [x-ray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray "X-ray"), [ultra-violet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra-violet "Ultra-violet"), regular [visible light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visible_light "Visible light") (optical), as well as infrared telescopes.

Leading discoveries
-------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Infrared_telescope&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Leading discoveries")]

There were several key developments that led to the invention of the infrared telescope:

*   In 1800, [William Herschel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Herschel "William Herschel") discovered infrared radiation.
*   In 1878, [Samuel Pierpoint Langley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Pierpoint_Langley "Samuel Pierpoint Langley") created the first [bolometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolometer "Bolometer"). This was a very sensitive instrument that could electrically detect incredibly small changes in temperature in the infrared spectrum.
*   Thomas Edison used an alternative technology, his [tasimeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasimeter "Tasimeter"), to measure heat in the Sun's [corona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_corona "Solar corona") during the [solar eclipse of July 29, 1878](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse_of_July_29,_1878 "Solar eclipse of July 29, 1878").
*   In the 1950s, scientists used lead-sulfide detectors to detect the infrared radiation from space. These detectors were cooled with [liquid nitrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_nitrogen "Liquid nitrogen").
*   Between 1959 and 1961, [Harold Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Johnson_(astronomer) "Harold Johnson (astronomer)") created near-infrared [photometers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photometer "Photometer") which allowed scientists to measure thousands of stars.
*   In 1961, [Frank Low](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Low "Frank Low") invented the first [germanium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanium "Germanium") bolometer. This invention, cooled by [liquid helium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_helium "Liquid helium"), led the way for current infrared telescope development.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_telescope#cite_note-caltech_timeline-2)

Infrared telescopes may be ground-based, air-borne, or [space telescopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_telescope "Space telescope"). They contain an infrared camera with a special solid-state infrared detector which must be cooled to [cryogenic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryogenics "Cryogenics") temperatures.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_telescope#cite_note-3)

Ground-based telescopes were the first to be used to observe outer space in infrared. Their popularity increased in the mid-1960s. Ground-based telescopes have limitations because [water vapor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_vapor "Water vapor") in the Earth's atmosphere absorbs infrared radiation. Ground-based infrared telescopes tend to be placed on high mountains and in very dry climates to improve visibility.

In the 1960s, scientists used balloons to lift infrared telescopes to higher altitudes. With balloons, they were able to reach about 25 miles (40 kilometres) up. In 1967, infrared telescopes were placed on rockets.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_telescope#cite_note-caltech_timeline-2) These were the first air-borne infrared telescopes. Since then, aircraft like the [Kuiper Airborne Observatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuiper_Airborne_Observatory "Kuiper Airborne Observatory") (KAO) have been adapted to carry infrared telescopes. A more recent air-borne infrared telescope to reach the stratosphere was NASA's [Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratospheric_Observatory_for_Infrared_Astronomy "Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy") (SOFIA) in May 2010. Together, United States scientists and the German Aerospace Center scientists placed a 17-ton infrared telescope on a [Boeing 747](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_747 "Boeing 747") jet airplane.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_telescope#cite_note-4)

Placing infrared telescopes in space eliminates the interference from the Earth's atmosphere. One of the most significant infrared telescope projects was the [Infrared Astronomical Satellite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_Astronomical_Satellite "Infrared Astronomical Satellite") (IRAS) that launched in 1983. It revealed information about other galaxies, as well as information about the center of our galaxy the Milky Way.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_telescope#cite_note-caltech_timeline-2) NASA presently has solar-powered spacecraft in space with an infrared telescope called the [James Webb Space Telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Webb_Space_Telescope "James Webb Space Telescope") (JWST). It was launched on December 25, 2021.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_telescope#cite_note-5)

The wavelength of visible light is about 0.4 μm to 0.7 μm, and 0.75 μm to 1000 μm (1 mm) is a typical range for [infrared astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_astronomy "Infrared astronomy"), [far-infrared astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-infrared_astronomy "Far-infrared astronomy"), to [submillimetre astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submillimetre_astronomy "Submillimetre astronomy").
