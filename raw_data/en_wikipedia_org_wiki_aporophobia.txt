Aporophobia (from the Spanish aporofobia , and this from the Ancient Greek ἄπορος ( áporos ), 'without resources, indigent, poor,' and φόβος ( phobos ), 'hatred' or 'aversion') [ 1 ] [ 2 ] are negative attitudes and feelings towards poverty and poor people. It is the disgust and hostility toward poor people, those without resources or who are helpless.

[ 3 ] The word povertyism is also used, in the field of international law, to denote this form of discrimination against people living in poverty.
