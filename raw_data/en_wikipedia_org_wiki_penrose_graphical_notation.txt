[ 1 ] A diagram in the notation consists of several shapes linked together by lines.

The notation widely appears in modern quantum theory , particularly in matrix product states and quantum circuits .  In particular, categorical quantum mechanics (which includes ZX-calculus ) is a fully comprehensive reformulation of quantum theory in terms of Penrose diagrams.

The notation has been studied extensively by Predrag Cvitanović , who used it, along with Feynman's diagrams and other related notations in developing "birdtracks", a group-theoretical diagram to classify the classical Lie groups .

[ 2 ] Penrose's notation has also been generalized using representation theory to spin networks in physics, and with the presence of matrix groups to trace diagrams in linear algebra .

Interpretations [ edit ] Multilinear algebra [ edit ] In the language of multilinear algebra , each shape represents a multilinear function . The lines attached to shapes represent the inputs or outputs of a function, and attaching shapes together in some way is essentially the composition of functions .

Tensors [ edit ] In the language of tensor algebra , a particular tensor is associated with a particular shape with many lines projecting upwards and downwards, corresponding to abstract upper and lower indices of tensors respectively. Connecting lines between two shapes corresponds to contraction of indices . One advantage of this notation is that one does not have to invent new letters for new indices. This notation is also explicitly basis -independent.

[ 3 ] Matrices [ edit ] Each shape represents a matrix, and tensor multiplication is done horizontally, and matrix multiplication is done vertically.

Representation of special tensors [ edit ] Metric tensor [ edit ] The metric tensor is represented by a U-shaped loop or an upside-down U-shaped loop, depending on the type of tensor that is used.

metric tensor g a b {\displaystyle g^{ab}} metric tensor g a b {\displaystyle g_{ab}} Levi-Civita tensor [ edit ] The Levi-Civita antisymmetric tensor is represented by a thick horizontal bar with sticks pointing downwards or upwards, depending on the type of tensor that is used.

ε ε a b … … n {\displaystyle \varepsilon _{ab\ldots n}} ε ε a b … … n {\displaystyle \varepsilon ^{ab\ldots n}} ε ε a b … … n ε ε a b … … n {\displaystyle \varepsilon _{ab\ldots n}\,\varepsilon ^{ab\ldots n}} = n !

{\displaystyle =n!} Structure constant [ edit ] Structure constant γ γ α α β β χ χ = − − γ γ β β α α χ χ {\displaystyle {\gamma _{\alpha \beta }}^{\chi }=-{\gamma _{\beta \alpha }}^{\chi }} The structure constants ( γ γ a b c {\displaystyle {\gamma _{ab}}^{c}} ) of a Lie algebra are represented by a small triangle with one line pointing upwards and two lines pointing downwards.

Tensor operations [ edit ] Contraction of indices [ edit ] Contraction of indices is represented by joining the index lines together.

Kronecker delta δ δ b a {\displaystyle \delta _{b}^{a}} Dot product β β a ξ ξ a {\displaystyle \beta _{a}\,\xi ^{a}} g a b g b c = δ δ a c = g c b g b a {\displaystyle g_{ab}\,g^{bc}=\delta _{a}^{c}=g^{cb}\,g_{ba}} Symmetrization [ edit ] Symmetrization of indices is represented by a thick zigzag or wavy bar crossing the index lines horizontally.

Symmetrization Q ( a b … … n ) {\displaystyle Q^{(ab\ldots n)}} (with Q a b = Q [ a b ] + Q ( a b ) {\displaystyle {}_{Q^{ab}=Q^{[ab]}+Q^{(ab)}}} ) Antisymmetrization [ edit ] Antisymmetrization of indices is represented by a thick straight line crossing the index lines horizontally.

Antisymmetrization E [ a b … … n ] {\displaystyle E_{[ab\ldots n]}} (with E a b = E [ a b ] + E ( a b ) {\displaystyle {}_{E_{ab}=E_{[ab]}+E_{(ab)}}} ) Determinant [ edit ] The determinant is formed by applying antisymmetrization to the indices.

Determinant det T = det ( T b a ) {\displaystyle \det \mathbf {T} =\det \left(T_{\ b}^{a}\right)} Inverse of matrix T − − 1 = ( T b a ) − − 1 {\displaystyle \mathbf {T} ^{-1}=\left(T_{\ b}^{a}\right)^{-1}} Covariant derivative [ edit ] The covariant derivative ( ∇ ∇ {\displaystyle \nabla } ) is represented by a circle around the tensor(s) to be differentiated and a line joined from the circle pointing downwards to represent the lower index of the derivative.

covariant derivative 12 ∇ ∇ a ( ξ ξ f λ λ f b [ c ( d D g h ] e ) b ) {\displaystyle 12\nabla _{a}\left(\xi ^{f}\,\lambda _{fb[c}^{(d}\,D_{gh]}^{e)b}\right)} = 12 ( ξ ξ f ( ∇ ∇ a λ λ f b [ c ( d ) D g h ] e ) b + ( ∇ ∇ a ξ ξ f ) λ λ f b [ c ( d D g h ] e ) b + ξ ξ f λ λ f b [ c ( d ( ∇ ∇ a D g h ] e ) b ) ) {\displaystyle =12\left(\xi ^{f}(\nabla _{a}\lambda _{fb[c}^{(d})\,D_{gh]}^{e)b}+(\nabla _{a}\xi ^{f})\lambda _{fb[c}^{(d}\,D_{gh]}^{e)b}+\xi ^{f}\lambda _{fb[c}^{(d}\,(\nabla _{a}D_{gh]}^{e)b})\right)} Tensor manipulation [ edit ] The diagrammatic notation is useful in manipulating tensor algebra. It usually involves a few simple " identities " of tensor manipulations.

For example, ε ε a .

c ε ε a .

.

c = n !

{\displaystyle \varepsilon _{a...c}\varepsilon ^{a...c}=n!} , where n is the number of dimensions, is a common "identity".

Riemann curvature tensor [ edit ] The Ricci and Bianchi identities given in terms of the Riemann curvature tensor illustrate the power of the notation Notation for the Riemann curvature tensor Ricci tensor R a b = R a c b c {\displaystyle R_{ab}=R_{acb}^{\ \ \ c}} Ricci identity ( ∇ ∇ a ∇ ∇ b − − ∇ ∇ b ∇ ∇ a ) ξ ξ d {\displaystyle (\nabla _{a}\,\nabla _{b}-\nabla _{b}\,\nabla _{a})\,\mathbf {\xi } ^{d}} = R a b c d ξ ξ c {\displaystyle =R_{abc}^{\ \ \ d}\,\mathbf {\xi } ^{c}} Bianchi identity ∇ ∇ [ a R b c ] d e = 0 {\displaystyle \nabla _{[a}R_{bc]d}^{\ \ \ e}=0} Extensions [ edit ] The notation has been extended with support for spinors and twistors .
