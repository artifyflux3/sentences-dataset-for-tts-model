They contain a single subclass ( Chromadoria ) and several orders. With such a redundant arrangement, the Chromadoria are liable to be divided if the orders are found to form several clades , or abandoned if they are found to constitute a single radiation.

Formerly, they were treated as a subclass in the paraphyletic " Adenophorea " assemblage, which has been mostly abandoned by modern authors. It is also suspected that the Chromadorea may not be monophyletic as delimited here; at least the Monhysterida seem to be a distinct and far more ancient lineage than the rest.

Members of this class' bodies usually have annules, their amphids elaborate and spiral, and they all have three esophageal glands . They usually live in marine sediments, although they can live elsewhere. They have a more sophisticated pharynx than most roundworms.

Members of this class can be identified by the presence of eight conserved signature indels (CSIs) exclusively shared by the class.

[ 1 ] These molecular markers are found in essential proteins such as tRNA (guanine-N(1))-methyltransferase and can serve as a reliable molecular method of distinguishing the Chromadorea from other classes within the phylum Nematoda.

[ 1 ] Orders [ edit ] See also: List of nematode families Provisionally, the following orders are placed here: Araeolaimida Ascaridida [ 2 ] Chromadorida Desmodorida Desmoscolecida Monhysterida [ 3 ] Rhabditida Rhigonematida [ 2 ] Notes [ edit ] The Benthimermithida are also occasionally placed here.

The Ascaridida appear to be nested within Rhabditida.
