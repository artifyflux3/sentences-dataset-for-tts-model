Ebola virus (SEM) Articles related to the Western African Ebola virus epidemic Overview Ebola virus disease Timeline of the epidemic Responses to the epidemic Timeline, tables and graphs Ebola virus disease treatment research Post-Ebola virus syndrome Ebola vaccine Nations with widespread cases Guinea Liberia Sierra Leone Other affected nations Mali Nigeria Senegal Spain United States United Kingdom Italy Other outbreaks List of Ebola outbreaks 1976 Zaire Ebola virus outbreak 2014 DR Congo outbreak Kivu Ebola epidemic List of epidemics and pandemics v t e This list of Ebola outbreaks records the known occurrences of Ebola virus disease , a highly infectious and acutely lethal viral disease that has afflicted humans and animals primarily in equatorial Africa .

[ 1 ] The pathogens responsible for the disease are the five ebolaviruses recognized by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses : Ebola virus (EBOV), Sudan virus (SUDV), Reston virus (RESTV), Taï Forest virus (TAFV), and Bundibugyo virus (BDBV).

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Four of the five variants have caused the disease in humans as well as other animals; RESTV has caused clinical symptoms only in non-human primates .

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] RESTV has caused subclinical infections in humans, producing an antibody response but no visual symptoms or disease state manifestations.

[ 8 ] Transmission of the ebolaviruses between natural reservoirs and humans is rare, and outbreaks of Ebola virus disease are often traceable to a single case where an individual has handled the carcass of a gorilla , chimpanzee , bats , [ 9 ] or duiker .

[ 10 ] The virus then spreads person-to-person, especially within families, in hospitals, and during some mortuary rituals where contact among individuals becomes more likely.

[ 11 ] Learning from failed responses, such as during the 2000 outbreak in Uganda , the World Health Organization (WHO) established its Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network , and other public health measures were instituted in areas at high risk. Field laboratories were established to confirm cases, instead of shipping samples to South Africa .

[ 12 ] Outbreaks are also closely monitored by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Special Pathogens Branch.

[ 13 ] Nigeria was the first country in western Africa to successfully curtail the virus, and its procedures have served as a model for other countries to follow.

[ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] Events [ edit ] The information in the following tables comes from the World Health Organization (WHO). This data excludes all laboratory personnel cases, Reston virus cases (since they are all asymptomatic ), and suspected cases.

[ 17 ] For a complete overview, those cases are included below with footnotes and supporting sources.

Major or massive cases [ edit ] Date Country [ a ] Virus Human cases Human deaths Case fatality rate Description Jun–Nov 1976 Sudan SUDV 284 151 53% Occurred in Nzara (the source town), Maridi , Tumbura , and Juba (cities in present-day South Sudan ). The index cases were workers in a cotton factory. The disease was spread by close contact with an acute case, usually from patients to their nurses. Many medical care personnel were infected.

[ 18 ] Aug 1976 Zaire EBOV 318 280 88% Main article: 1976 Zaire Ebola virus outbreak Occurred in Yambuku and surrounding areas in what was then Zaire (present-day Democratic Republic of the Congo DRC). It spread through personal contact and by use of contaminated needles and syringes in hospitals and clinics.

[ 19 ] Aug–Sep 1979 Sudan SUDV 34 22 65% Occurred in Nzara and Maridi. This was a recurrent outbreak at the same site as the 1976 Sudan epidemic.

[ 20 ] Dec 1994–Feb 1995 Gabon EBOV 52 31 60% Occurred in Makokou and gold-mining camps deep in the rainforest along the Ivindo River . Until 1995, the outbreak was incorrectly classified as yellow fever .

[ 21 ] May–Jul 1995 Zaire EBOV 315 254 81% Occurred in Kikwit and surrounding areas. The outbreak was traced to a patient who worked in a forest adjoining the city. The epidemic spread through families and hospital admissions.

[ 22 ] [ 23 ] Jan 1996–Mar 1997 Gabon EBOV 91 66 72.53% The first strain Occurred in the village of Mayibout 2 and neighboring areas. A chimpanzee found dead in the forest was eaten by villagers hunting for food. Nineteen people involved in the butchery of the animal became ill, and other cases occurred in their family members.

[ 21 ] The last strain Occurred in the Booué area with transport of patients to Libreville . The index case-patient was a hunter who lived in a forest timber camp . The disease was spread by close contact with infected persons. A dead chimpanzee found in the forest at the time was determined to be infected.

[ 21 ] Oct 2000–Jan 2001 Uganda SUDV 425 224 53% Occurred in the Gulu , Masindi , and Mbarara districts of Uganda. The three greatest risks associated with Sudan virus infection were attending funerals of case-patients, having contact with case-patients in one's family, and providing medical care to case-patients without using adequate personal protective measures.

[ 24 ] Victims included Matthew Lukwiya .

Oct 2001–Dec 2003 Gabon ROC EBOV 302 254 84.11% The first strain Occurred on both sides of the border between Gabon and the Republic of the Congo (RC). This outbreak included the first reported occurrence of Ebola virus disease in the RC.

[ 25 ] The second strain Occurred in the districts of Mbomo and Kelle in the Cuvette-Ouest Department .

[ 26 ] The third strain Occurred in Mbomo and Mbandza villages, located in Mbomo District in the Cuvette-Ouest Department.

[ 27 ] Apr–Jun 2004 Sudan SUDV 17 7 41% Occurred in Yambio county in Western Equatoria of southern Sudan (present-day South Sudan ). This outbreak was concurrent with an outbreak of measles in the same area, and several suspected EVD cases were reclassified later as measles cases.

[ 28 ] Apr-May 2005 ROC EBOV 12 10 83% Occurred in the Etoumbi district of Cuvette Ouest Department of the Republic of the Congo [ 29 ] Aug–Nov 2007 DRC EBOV 264 187 71% Dec 2007–Jan 2008 Uganda BDBV 149 37 25% Occurred in the Bundibugyo District in western Uganda.

Aug–Nov 2014 DRC EBOV 66 [ 40 ] 49 [ 40 ] 74% Main article: 2014 Democratic Republic of the Congo Ebola virus outbreak Occurred in Équateur province. Outbreak detected 24 August and, as of 28 October 2014, the WHO said that twenty days had passed since the last reported case was discharged and no new contacts were being followed.

[ 40 ] [ 41 ] Declared over on 15 November 2014.

[ 42 ] May–Jul 2018 DRC EBOV 54 33 61% Main article: 2018 Équateur province Ebola outbreak On 8 May 2018, the government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo reported two confirmed cases of Ebola infection in the northwestern town of Bikoro .

[ 43 ] On 17 May, a case was confirmed in the city of Mbandaka .

[ 54 ] [ 55 ] [ 56 ] [ 57 ] On 11 June 2019, the WHO confirmed that a five-year-old boy in Uganda died after being diagnosed with Ebola.

[ 58 ] [ 59 ] On 25 June 2020, the second biggest EVD outbreak ever was declared over.

[ 60 ] May 2020–Nov 2020 DRC EBOV 130 55 42% Main article: 2020 Équateur province Ebola outbreak On 31 May 2020, the DRC Health Minister Eteni Longondo announced an additional Ebola outbreak, separate to the ongoing Kivu Ebola epidemic . The outbreak originated in Équateur province (which was also the location of the 2018 Équateur province Ebola outbreak ).

[ 61 ] [ 62 ] [ 63 ] By 17 October 2020, the case count was 128 with 53 fatalities.

[ 64 ] By 18 November 2020, the World Health Organization and the Congolese government had not received reports of any cases of Ebola in Équateur province or all of the DRC for 42 days.

^ a b c All cases were asymptomatic.

^ The case was repatriated to Switzerland for medical treatment.

[ 90 ] ^ The mortality rate (death/case ratio) recorded in Liberia up to 26 August 2014 was 70 percent.

[ 34 ] However, the general estimated case fatality rate (70.8 percent) for this ongoing epidemic differs from the ratio of the number of deaths divided by that of cases due to the estimation method used. Current infections have not run their course, and the estimate may be poor if reporting is biased towards severe cases.

^ The Centers for Disease Control chronology notes this infection as " Sudan virus ", whereas the 1977 British Medical Journal (BMJ) article refers to it as " Ebola virus ". In 1977, there was no distinction between different ebolaviruses . The BMJ article notes only that the patient received "convalescent serum from the Sudan" following similar serum from Zaire References [ edit ] ^ a b "Outbreaks Chronology: Ebola Virus Disease" .
