Indexing CODEN ( alt · alt2 ) · JSTOR ( alt ) · LCCN ( alt ) MIAR · NLM ( alt ) · Scopus · W&L ISSN 0002-3264 The Proceedings of the USSR Academy of Sciences ( Russian : Доклады Академии Наук СССР , Doklady Akademii Nauk SSSR ( DAN SSSR ), French : Comptes Rendus de l'Académie des Sciences de l'URSS [kɔ̃t ʁɑ̃dy də lakademi de sjɑ̃s də ly.ɛʁ.ɛs.ɛs] ) was a Soviet journal [ 1 ] that was dedicated to publishing original, academic research papers in physics, mathematics, chemistry, geology, and biology. It was first published in 1933 and ended in 1992 with volume 322, issue 3.

Today, it is continued by Doklady Akademii Nauk ( Russian : Доклады Академии Наук ), [ 2 ] which began publication in 1992. The journal is also known as the Proceedings of the Russian Academy of Sciences (RAS) .

Doklady has had a complicated publication and translation history. A number of translation journals exist which publish selected articles from the original by subject section; these are listed below.

The journal is indexed in Russian Science Citation Index .

[ 3 ] History [ edit ] The Russian Academy of Sciences dates from 1724, with a continuous series of variously named publications dating from 1726.

[ 4 ] Doklady Akademii Nauk SSSR-Comptes Rendus de l'Académie des Sciences de l'URSS, Seriya A first appeared in 1925 publishing original, academic research papers in the sciences, mathematics and technology in Russian or very occasionally in English, French or German.

Novaia Seriya replaced Seriya A in 1933, with articles published in Russian and immediately followed by a translation into English, French, or German.

In 1935, with v.3(8), Comptes Rendus de l'Académie des Sciences de l'URSS was split off as a separate journal that continued publishing corresponding Doklady translations [ 5 ] until 1947, when it ceased publication. The change in volume numbering with 1935, v.3(8) virtually renumbered: 1933; 1934, v.1-4; and 1935, v.1-2, to: v. 1, 1933; v.2-5, 1934; and v.6-7, 1935.

Doklady Akademii Nauk SSSR continued publication until 1992, when it changed title to Doklady Akademii Nauk .

[ 6 ] Some Comptes Rendus (Doklady)...

articles also appear to have been published in European journals, and Reaxys / Beilstein and Berichte der Deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft (Chemische Berichte), Web of Science , Chemical Abstracts (SciFinder) and "Doklady" all use different transliteration schemes.

[ 7 ] An excellent review of the multiplicity of national/international transliteration schemes is given by Hoseh.

[ 8 ] Indexing problems [ edit ] This section possibly contains original research .

Please improve it by verifying the claims made and adding inline citations . Statements consisting only of original research should be removed.

( October 2014 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) SciFinder incorrectly assigned Doklady Akademii Nauk SSSR, Seriya A to articles published between 1933 and 1935, v.2 in Doklady Akademii Nauk SSSR and to articles published between 1935, v.3(8) to v.56(2), 1947 in Comptes Rendus de l'Académie des Sciences de l'URSS . The print Chemical Abstracts provides the correct journal title. Scifinder records for articles published in 1935, v.3(8), 1935 are inconsistently shown as either v.3 or v.8. SciFinder records also do not consistently provide both the Russian and English, French or German pagination for the 1933–1935, v.2 articles.

Web of Science adds a further complication by incorrectly omitting (Doklady) from the journal title, [ 9 ] while Reaxys/Beilstein incorrectly gives Chemische Berichte as the journal title for articles appearing in Berichte der Deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft.

Records in SciFinder and INSPEC for articles published in 1933; 1934, v.1-4; and 1935, v.1-2, are shown in Web of Science as v.1, 1933 – v.7, 1935, because the Web of Science records were indexed for the Century of Science [ 10 ] from library volumes that had been subsequently renumbered by the cooperating library.

Translations [ edit ] English translations of "Doklady" articles began again in 1956, when the American Institute of Physics began publishing Soviet Physics - Doklady . Other publications soon followed and within a few years most Doklady subject sections were available in English translation.

Doklady translation journals are as of 2013 published by Pleiades Publishing, Ltd and distributed online by Springer Science+Business Media . The online translation journals now only publish "selected" articles from the original Russian-language journal, which is also available online from 2006.

[ 11 ] Determining the appropriate English translation journal for articles published in ‘Doklady’ is often problematic.

One approach is to check the Russian Doklady issue contents page to identify the subject section and then determine in which translation journal the article was published. The translation journal's contents pages will provide a concordance linking the ‘Doklady’ page numbers with the ‘translation journal’ page numbers.

Another approach is to search SciFinder for the original article, which may show the Doklady subject section, [ 12 ] since Chemical Abstracts only indexed the original Russian language articles until 1995.

[ 13 ] Translation journal titles and their Doklady subject sections [ edit ] Several journals of translations exist, each containing articles that pertain to a particular subject.
