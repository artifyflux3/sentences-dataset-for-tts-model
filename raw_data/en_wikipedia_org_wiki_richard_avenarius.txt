He formulated the radical positivist doctrine of " empirical criticism " or empirio-criticism .

Life [ edit ] Avenarius attended the Nicolaischule in Leipzig and studied at the University of Zurich , Berlin , and the University of Leipzig . At the University of Leipzig, he received the Doctor of Philosophy in 1868 with his thesis on Baruch Spinoza and his pantheism , obtained the habilitation in 1876, and taught there as Privatdozent .  One year later, he became a professor at the University of Zurich. He died in Zurich in 1896.

Work [ edit ] Avenarius believed that scientific philosophy must be concerned with purely descriptive definitions of experience, which must be free of both metaphysics and materialism . His opposition to the materialist assertions of Carl Vogt resulted in an attack upon empirio-criticism by Vladimir Lenin in the latter's Materialism and Empirio-criticism .

Avenarius' principal works are the famously difficult Kritik der reinen Erfahrung ( Critique of Pure Experience , 1888–1890) and Der menschliche Weltbegriff ( The Human Concept of the World , 1891) which influenced Ernst Mach , Ber Borochov and, to a lesser extent, William James .

[ 2 ] He taught Anatoly Lunacharsky and was also influential on Alexander Bogdanov and Nikolai Valentinov .

Family [ edit ] Avenarius was the second son of the German publisher Eduard Avenarius and Cäcilie née Geyer, a daughter of the actor and painter Ludwig Geyer and a (step-)sister of Richard Wagner . However, there is speculation that her father was the biological father of Richard Wagner too. Richard Avenarius's brother, Ferdinand Avenarius , led the cultural organization Dürerbund and belonged to the initiators of a culture reform movement in Germany. Wagner was Avenarius's godfather .
