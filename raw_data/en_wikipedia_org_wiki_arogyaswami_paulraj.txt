Paulraj: Academic Profile Arogyaswami J. Paulraj (born April 14, 1944) is an Indian-American electrical engineer and a Professor Emeritus in the Department of Electrical Engineering at Stanford University .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] . He is known for  pioneering MIMO (Multiple Input, Multiple Output) wireless technology, the foundation of modern high-speed wireless communication networks.

Early life and education [ edit ] Paulraj was born in Pollachi, near Coimbatore, British India, in 1944. He attended Montfort Boys' High School in Yercaud, India. In 1961, he joined the National Defense Academy and was commissioned into the Indian Navy in 1965.He was deputed for two years (1969-1971) to Indian Institute of Technology Delhi for Ph.D. research, where he developed an unified  solution to a broad class of signal estimation problems modeled by non-linear stochastic differential equations, and received a Ph.D. degree in 1973.

Career in India [ edit ] Sonar Systems Development [ edit ] From 1972 to 1974, following the loss of INS Khukri (F149) due to torpedo action by Pakistan Navy PNS Hangor (S131) in the 1971 Indo-Pakistan war, highlighting the need to enhance the range performance of the British-origin Anti-Submarine Sonar 170B fitted on INS Khukri, and also widely deployed on other warships in the Indian Navy. Paulraj led a team  to successfully redesign the  Sonar 170B.

[ 3 ] . Later, from 1977 to 1983, he led a large multi-agency program to develop the APSOH Sonar [ 4 ] . APSOH was among the top sonars in the world in it's class, and along with its later versions, became the backbone of Indian Navy's sonar capability.

Academic Sabbaticals [ edit ] During breaks from Naval Sonar development projects, Paulraj was a visiting scholar at Loughborough University [ 5 ] (1974-75), and Stanford University (1984-86). At Stanford University [ 6 ] , he researched multiple signal Directions-of-Arrival (DOA) problem, using the MUSIC algorithm, which utilized 'peak picking' in an angular power spectrum to estimate the DOAs. Drawing on his earlier work on APSOH sonar design in India, where Paulraj had explored "null picking" as an approach for a single signal DOA estimation, and had explored peak vs null picking experimentally. Those insights led Paulraj to the Estimation_of_signal_parameters_via_rotational_invariance_techniques (ESPRIT) algorithm for multi signal DOA estimation using a 'nulling' approach, and  launched a new paradigm in signal processing.

Founding National Laboratories [ edit ] Between 1987 and 1991, Paulraj founded or co-founded three national labs in India: the Center for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics [ 7 ] , Central Research Laboratories , Bharat Electronics [ 8 ] , and Center for Development of Advanced Computing [ 9 ] .

In 1991, he decided to explore an academic career, and took an early retirement from the Indian Navy and with their permission, emigrated to the United States.

Career in the United States [ edit ] MIMO Wireless Invention and Advancement [ edit ] Paulraj joined Stanford University as research associate in 1991, and was appointed a research professor in 1993 and served for 17 years, before retiring Stanford in 2010. When he joined Stanford in  1991, he worked on research contracts awarded to Prof. Thomas Kailath (EE Dept.) and Prof Gene Golub (Math Dept.). The latter contract involved signal separation using antenna arrays in airborne reconnaissance aircraft and Paulraj conducted experiments to validate candidate algorithms.A serendipitous observation, triggered by a rain shower, during these experiments led to the invention of MIMO technology.

[ 10 ] . At Stanford, he led the Smart Antennas Research Group, graduating 24 doctoral students and 25 postdoctoral scholars [ 11 ] , and along with his students co-authored the first (2003) text book on MIMO, [ 12 ] , contributed over 300 research publications [ 13 ] ,
and co-invented (along with co-workers in his startup companies) over 150 patents filed across multiple jurisdictions.

[ 14 ] . MIMO triggered a R&D  worldwide ecosystem, which after three decades has built a corpus of over 500,000 research publications [ 15 ] , and over 600,000  patent publications.

[ 16 ] .

MIMO Commercialization and Impact [ edit ] After initial research at Stanford focused on validating MIMO in real world applications, Paulraj launched the first two companies in MIMO wireless. In 1998, he founded Iospan Wireless , along with Helmut Boelskei, D. Gesbert, R. Heath, and J. Tellado from his research group as the founding  team. Iospan developed a complete MIMO-OFDM based cellular network for fixed broadband wireless (base station, subscriber station, AAA and NMS servers,  backhaul network,  and access gateways).   The company  was acquired by Intel in 2003.

[ 17 ] . And in 2004, he co-founded (with S. Mandava and S. Hedayat) Beceem Communications , that developed MIMO-OFDM (4G WiMAX) modem semiconductors that were widely used in MyFi devices, USB modems, CPEs and android phones. The company was acquired by Broadcom in 2010.

[ 18 ] Paulraj’s work laid the foundations for the eventual adoption of MIMO in 4G/5G mobile and 802.11 Wi-Fi standards in 2008 and 2009  respectively.These networks now support over six billions wireless users, contributing substantially to the global GDP.  Industry alliances estimate the global economic value (2023-24) of mobile networks at $5.7 trillion [ 19 ] and of WiFi networks at $3.5 trillion [ 20 ] , and support revenues of $450 billion from equipment industry and $1.1 trillion from mobile operators [ 21 ] .

Professional Service [ edit ] Paulraj  has served on editorial boards of research journals, as advisor or independent director in tech companies( [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] ), member of boards or councils for societies and foundations( [ 24 ] ), and as advisor to governments on industrial policy to support indigenous semiconductors and systems industry. He currently supports the Indian Govt.

[ 25 ] Work with Industry [ edit ] Since joining Stanford in 1991, Paulraj built close connections with the wireless industry and has worked with over a dozen early-stage wireless technology companies and  venture capital firms.
In 2014, he co-founded (with S. Mandava) Rasa Networks to develop WiFi network management tools. Rasa was acquired by Hewlett Packard Enterprise in 2016.

[ 26 ] Awards and Recognitions [ edit ] Awards [ edit ] Paulraj has received over two dozen awards, notably Marconi Prize [ 27 ] Prince Philip Medal [ 28 ] IEEE Alexander Graham Bell Medal [ 29 ] IET Faraday Medal [ 30 ] National Inventors Hall of Fame [ 31 ] Padma Bhushan [ 32 ] National Academies [ edit ] Paulraj is a fellow of several national academies, including the American Academy of Arts and Sciences [ 33 ] , Chinese Academy of Engineering [ 34 ] , U.S. National Academy of Engineering [ 35 ] , Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences [ 36 ] , Indian Academy of Sciences [ 37 ] , and The World Academy of Sciences [ 38 ] Fellowships [ edit ] Paulraj has held national fellowships in India and China  and currently holds a Distinguished Vaibhav Fellowship from the Indian Government [ 39 ] .
