[ 2 ] When the men would come back from the magpie goose hunt, they would be craving murnyaŋ foods after having eaten so much meat and eggs.  Meanwhile, the women, children and old people back in the camps would be looking forward to gonyil , magpie goose meat and eggs, after eating so much murnyaŋ' .
