It started roughly 1 second after the Big Bang, after the majority of hadrons and anti-hadrons annihilated each other at the end of the hadron epoch .

[ 1 ] During the lepton epoch, the temperature of the Universe was still high enough to create neutrino and electron-positron pairs. Approximately 10 seconds after the Big Bang, the temperature of the universe had fallen to the point where electron-positron pairs were gradually annihilated.

[ 2 ] A small residue of electrons needed to charge-neutralize the Universe [ clarification needed ] remained along with free streaming neutrinos: an important aspect of this epoch is the neutrino decoupling .

[ 3 ] The Big Bang nucleosynthesis epoch follows, overlapping with the photon epoch .
