In botany , sessility (meaning "sitting", in the sense of "resting on the surface") is a characteristic of plant organs such as flowers or leaves that have no stalk.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Plant parts can also be described as subsessile , that is, not completely sessile.

A sessile flower is one that lacks a pedicel (flower stalk). A flower that is not sessile is pedicellate . For example, the genus Trillium is partitioned into multiple subgenera, the sessile-flowered trilliums ( Trillium subgen.

Sessilia ) and the pedicellate-flowered trilliums.

The term "sessility" is also used in mycology to describe a fungal fruit body that is attached to or seated directly on the surface of the substrate , lacking a supporting stipe or pedicel .
