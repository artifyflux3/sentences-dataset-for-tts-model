[ 1 ] The situation may be a live performance or in a recording session , and the group may or may not have its own name, such as " The Heartbreakers " (the band of Tom Petty ), or " Bob Wills and his Texas Playboys " in the 1930s.

[ 2 ] Often, backup bands contain sidemen who are skilled but not known to the public; these musicians may be replaced or substituted at any time without noticeable impact on the performance.

[ 3 ] A number of cohesive stand-alone groups of musicians have emerged from the shadow of the starring celebrity (whom they are backing) to achieve a stature of their own. An example is the Eagles in 1971, emerging from being the backing band for Linda Ronstadt .

[ 4 ] Another example is The Band , a group who backed Bob Dylan on his world tour in 1966 , his first tour with electric instruments .

[ 5 ] A backing band may also be a cadre of elite studio musicians who serve as a house band for major studios. The same musicians may perform on records by a number of different artists. Examples are Stax Records' band, Booker T. & the M.G.'s ;  Detroit's The Funk Brothers ; and Nashville's A-Team .
