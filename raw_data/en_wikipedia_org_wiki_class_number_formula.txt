General statement of the class number formula [ edit ] We start with the following data: K is a number field.

[ K : Q ] = n = r 1 + 2 r 2 , where r 1 denotes the number of real embeddings of K , and 2 r 2 is the number of complex embeddings of K .

ζ K ( s ) is the Dedekind zeta function of K .

h K is the class number , the number of elements in the ideal class group of K .

Reg K is the regulator of K .

w K is the number of roots of unity contained in K .

D K is the discriminant of the extension K / Q .

Then: Theorem (Class Number Formula).

ζ K ( s ) converges absolutely for Re( s ) > 1 and extends to a meromorphic function defined for all complex s with only one simple pole at s = 1 , with residue lim s → → 1 ( s − − 1 ) ζ ζ K ( s ) = 2 r 1 ⋅ ⋅ ( 2 π π ) r 2 ⋅ ⋅ Reg K ⋅ ⋅ h K w K ⋅ ⋅ | D K | {\displaystyle \lim _{s\to 1}(s-1)\zeta _{K}(s)={\frac {2^{r_{1}}\cdot (2\pi )^{r_{2}}\cdot \operatorname {Reg} _{K}\cdot h_{K}}{w_{K}\cdot {\sqrt {|D_{K}|}}}}} This is the most general "class number formula". In particular cases, for example when K is a cyclotomic extension of Q , there are particular and more refined class number formulas.

Proof [ edit ] The idea of the proof of the class number formula is most easily seen when K = Q (i). In this case, the ring of integers in K is the Gaussian integers .

An elementary manipulation shows that the residue of the Dedekind zeta function at s = 1 is the average of the coefficients of the Dirichlet series representation of the Dedekind zeta function. The n -th coefficient of the Dirichlet series is essentially the number of representations of n as a sum of two squares of nonnegative integers. So one can compute the residue of the Dedekind zeta function at s = 1 by computing the average number of representations. As in the article on the Gauss circle problem , one can compute this by approximating the number of lattice points inside of a quarter circle centered at the origin, concluding that the residue is one quarter of pi.

The proof when K is an arbitrary imaginary quadratic number field is very similar.

[ 1 ] In the general case, by Dirichlet's unit theorem , the group of units in the ring of integers of K is infinite. One can nevertheless reduce the computation of the residue to a lattice point counting problem using the classical theory of real and complex embeddings and approximate the number of lattice points in a region by the volume of the region, to complete the proof.

Dirichlet class number formula [ edit ] Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet published a proof of the class number formula for quadratic fields in 1839, but it was stated in the language of quadratic forms rather than classes of ideals . It appears that Gauss already knew this formula in 1801.

[ 2 ] This exposition follows Davenport .

[ 3 ] Let d be a fundamental discriminant , and write h(d) for the number of equivalence classes of quadratic forms with discriminant d . Let χ χ = ( d m ) {\displaystyle \chi =\left(\!{\frac {d}{m}}\!\right)} be the Kronecker symbol . Then χ χ {\displaystyle \chi } is a Dirichlet character . Write L ( s , χ χ ) {\displaystyle L(s,\chi )} for the Dirichlet L-series based on χ χ {\displaystyle \chi } . For d > 0 , let t > 0 , u > 0 be the solution to the Pell equation t 2 − − d u 2 = 4 {\displaystyle t^{2}-du^{2}=4} for which u is smallest, and write ε ε = 1 2 ( t + u d ) .

{\displaystyle \varepsilon ={\frac {1}{2}}(t+u{\sqrt {d}}).} (Then ε ε {\displaystyle \varepsilon } is either a fundamental unit of the real quadratic field Q ( d ) {\displaystyle \mathbb {Q} ({\sqrt {d}})} or the square of a fundamental unit.)
For d < 0, write w for the number of automorphisms of quadratic forms of discriminant d ; that is, w = { 2 , d < − − 4 ; 4 , d = − − 4 ; 6 , d = − − 3.

{\displaystyle w={\begin{cases}2,&d<-4;\\4,&d=-4;\\6,&d=-3.\end{cases}}} Then Dirichlet showed that h ( d ) = { w | d | 2 π π L ( 1 , χ χ ) , d < 0 ; d 2 ln ⁡ ⁡ ε ε L ( 1 , χ χ ) , d > 0.

{\displaystyle h(d)={\begin{cases}{\dfrac {w{\sqrt {|d|}}}{2\pi }}L(1,\chi ),&d<0;\\{\dfrac {\sqrt {d}}{2\ln \varepsilon }}L(1,\chi ),&d>0.\end{cases}}} This is a special case of Theorem 1 above: for a quadratic field K , the Dedekind zeta function is just ζ ζ K ( s ) = ζ ζ ( s ) L ( s , χ χ ) {\displaystyle \zeta _{K}(s)=\zeta (s)L(s,\chi )} , and the residue is L ( 1 , χ χ ) {\displaystyle L(1,\chi )} . Dirichlet also showed that the L -series can be written in a finite form, which gives a finite form for the class number. Suppose χ χ {\displaystyle \chi } is primitive with prime conductor q {\displaystyle q} .  Then L ( 1 , χ χ ) = { − − π π q 3 / 2 ∑ ∑ m = 1 q − − 1 m ( m q ) , q ≡ ≡ 3 mod 4 ; − − 1 2 q 1 / 2 ∑ ∑ m = 1 q − − 1 ( m q ) ln ⁡ ⁡ ( sin ⁡ ⁡ m π π q ) , q ≡ ≡ 1 mod 4.

{\displaystyle L(1,\chi )={\begin{cases}-{\dfrac {\pi }{q^{3/2}}}\sum _{m=1}^{q-1}m\left({\dfrac {m}{q}}\right),&q\equiv 3\mod 4;\\-{\dfrac {1}{2q^{1/2}}}\sum _{m=1}^{q-1}\left({\dfrac {m}{q}}\right)\ln \left(\sin {\dfrac {m\pi }{q}}\right),&q\equiv 1\mod 4.\end{cases}}} Galois extensions of the rationals [ edit ] If K is a Galois extension of Q , the theory of Artin L-functions applies to ζ ζ K ( s ) {\displaystyle \zeta _{K}(s)} . It has one factor of the Riemann zeta function , which has a pole of residue one, and the quotient is regular at s = 1. This means that the right-hand side of the class number formula can be equated to a left-hand side Π L (1,ρ) dim ρ with ρ running over the classes of irreducible non-trivial complex linear representations of Gal( K / Q ) of dimension dim(ρ). That is according to the standard decomposition of the regular representation .

Abelian extensions of the rationals [ edit ] This is the case of the above, with Gal( K / Q ) an abelian group , in which all the ρ can be replaced by Dirichlet characters (via class field theory ) for some modulus f called the conductor . Therefore all the L (1) values occur for Dirichlet L-functions , for which there is a classical formula, involving logarithms.

By the Kronecker–Weber theorem , all the values required for an analytic class number formula occur already when the cyclotomic fields are considered. In that case there is a further formulation possible, as shown by Kummer . The regulator , a calculation of volume in 'logarithmic space' as divided by the logarithms of the units of the cyclotomic field, can be set against the quantities from the L (1) recognisable as logarithms of cyclotomic units . There result formulae stating that the class number is determined by the index of the cyclotomic units in the whole group of units.

In Iwasawa theory , these ideas are further combined with Stickelberger's theorem .
