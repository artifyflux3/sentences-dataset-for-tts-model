[ 3 ] History [ edit ] 19th century [ edit ] Harvard lacrosse team of 1881 Harvard fielded its first lacrosse team in 1878, [ 3 ] and the following year, joined the United States National Amateur Lacrosse Association alongside New York University and nine club teams.

[ 4 ] In 1881, Harvard defeated Princeton to win the first intercollegiate lacrosse tournament.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] In 1882, the Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association was formed, and the following season also inducted the newly established Yale lacrosse team.

[ 4 ] Harvard and Princeton dominated the league throughout the 1880s, [ 4 ] and the Crimson claimed the title in 1882, 1885, 1886, and 1887.

[ 3 ] 20th century [ edit ] The United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse League (USILL) was formed in 1905, divided into a Northern Division and Southern Division. Championships were awarded in each division based on record and strength of schedule . Harvard was named the Northern Division champions six consecutive seasons from 1908 to 1913, and again in 1915.

[ 4 ] In 1941, Navy refused to play the integrated Harvard team, so its athletic director ordered home its one black player rather than forfeit the game.

[ 6 ] The Crimson secured the Ivy League championship with the best league record in 1964*, 1980*, 1990*, and 2014* (* denotes title shared with at least one other team).

[ 3 ] In 1971 , the NCAA established the national championship tournament . Harvard made its first appearance in 1980 , when it lost in the first round to Johns Hopkins , 16–12. The Crimson returned to the event in 1988 and were edged, 10–9, by Navy in the opening round. In 1990 , Harvard won its first NCAA tournament game when it defeated Notre Dame , 9–3. In the quarterfinals, the Crimson were beaten handily, 18–3, by North Carolina . Harvard returned to the quarterfinals in 1996 , after beating Hofstra , 15–12, and then fell to eventual national runners-up Virginia , 23–12.

21st century [ edit ] After their 1996 appearance, the Crimson did not reach the tournament for another decade; when they were beaten in the 2006 first round by Syracuse , 11–4.
