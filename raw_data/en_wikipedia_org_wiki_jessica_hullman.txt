Hullman was formerly faculty at the University of Washington Information School (2015-2018). She is known for her research in Information visualization and Uncertainty quantification .

Education [ edit ] Hullman graduated magna cum laude from Ohio State University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Comparative Studies. She obtained a Masters of Fine Arts degree in Writings and Poetics from Naropa University . Hullman received her Master of Science in Information and Ph.D in Information Science from the University of Michigan - School of Information , where she was advised by Eytan Adar. She completed a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of California, Berkeley Computer Science Department with Maneesh Agrawala .

[ 1 ] Work [ edit ] Hullman has made contributions to topics including uncertainty visualization, Bayesian cognition , human-AI interaction, decision-making under uncertainty, and evaluation of software and interfaces. Her work has contributed new visualization types to help readers develop an intuitive sense of uncertainty, such as hypothetical outcome plots.

[ 2 ] Hullman has given many invited lectures and keynote presentations, including "Strategic Communication of Uncertainty" to the President's Council of Advisors on Science & Technology. Hullman is co-director of the Midwest Uncertainty (MU) Collective at Northwestern University .

Hullman has written articles for the popular press related to communicating uncertainty, including for Wired (with Andrew Gelman ), [ 3 ] Scientific American , The Hill and National Review (with Allison Schrager).

[ 4 ] She is a contributor to Andrew Gelman 's blog, Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science.

Awards [ edit ] Hullman was selected as a Microsoft Research Faculty Fellowship in 2019.

[ 5 ] She is the recipient of numerous best paper awards.
