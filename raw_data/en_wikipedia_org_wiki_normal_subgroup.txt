In other words, a subgroup N {\displaystyle N} of the group G {\displaystyle G} is normal in G {\displaystyle G} if and only if g n g − − 1 ∈ ∈ N {\displaystyle gng^{-1}\in N} for all g ∈ ∈ G {\displaystyle g\in G} and n ∈ ∈ N .

{\displaystyle n\in N.} The usual notation for this relation is N ◃ ◃ G .

{\displaystyle N\triangleleft G.} Normal subgroups are important because they (and only they) can be used to construct quotient groups of the given group.  Furthermore, the normal subgroups of G {\displaystyle G} are precisely the kernels of group homomorphisms with domain G , {\displaystyle G,} which means that they can be used to internally classify those homomorphisms.

Évariste Galois was the first to realize the importance of the existence of normal subgroups.

[ 2 ] Definitions [ edit ] A subgroup N {\displaystyle N} of a group G {\displaystyle G} is called a normal subgroup of G {\displaystyle G} if it is invariant under conjugation ; that is, the conjugation of an element of N {\displaystyle N} by an element of G {\displaystyle G} is always in N .

{\displaystyle N.} [ 3 ] The usual notation for this relation is N ◃ ◃ G .

{\displaystyle N\triangleleft G.} Equivalent conditions [ edit ] For any subgroup N {\displaystyle N} of G , {\displaystyle G,} the following conditions are equivalent to N {\displaystyle N} being a normal subgroup of G .

{\displaystyle G.} Therefore, any one of them may be taken as the definition.

The image of conjugation of N {\displaystyle N} by any element of G {\displaystyle G} is a subset of N , {\displaystyle N,} [ 4 ] i.e., g N g − − 1 ⊆ ⊆ N {\displaystyle gNg^{-1}\subseteq N} for all g ∈ ∈ G {\displaystyle g\in G} .

The image of conjugation of N {\displaystyle N} by any element of G {\displaystyle G} is equal to N , {\displaystyle N,} [ 4 ] i.e., g N g − − 1 = N {\displaystyle gNg^{-1}=N} for all g ∈ ∈ G {\displaystyle g\in G} .

For all g ∈ ∈ G , {\displaystyle g\in G,} the left and right cosets g N {\displaystyle gN} and N g {\displaystyle Ng} are equal.

[ 4 ] The sets of left and right cosets of N {\displaystyle N} in G {\displaystyle G} coincide.

[ 4 ] Multiplication in G {\displaystyle G} preserves the equivalence relation "is in the same left coset as". That is, for every g , g ′ , h , h ′ ∈ ∈ G {\displaystyle g,g',h,h'\in G} satisfying g N = g ′ N {\displaystyle gN=g'N} and h N = h ′ N {\displaystyle hN=h'N} , we have ( g h ) N = ( g ′ h ′ ) N .

{\displaystyle (gh)N=(g'h')N.} There exists a group on the set of left cosets of N {\displaystyle N} where multiplication of any two left cosets g N {\displaystyle gN} and h N {\displaystyle hN} yields the left coset ( g h ) N {\displaystyle (gh)N} . (This group is called the quotient group of G {\displaystyle G} modulo N {\displaystyle N} , denoted G / N {\displaystyle G/N} .) N {\displaystyle N} is a union of conjugacy classes of G .

{\displaystyle G.} [ 2 ] N {\displaystyle N} is preserved by the inner automorphisms of G .

{\displaystyle G.} [ 5 ] There is some group homomorphism G → → H {\displaystyle G\to H} whose kernel is N .

{\displaystyle N.} [ 2 ] There exists a group homomorphism ϕ ϕ : G → → H {\displaystyle \phi :G\to H} whose fibers form a group where the identity element is N {\displaystyle N} and multiplication of any two fibers ϕ ϕ − − 1 ( h 1 ) {\displaystyle \phi ^{-1}(h_{1})} and ϕ ϕ − − 1 ( h 2 ) {\displaystyle \phi ^{-1}(h_{2})} yields the fiber ϕ ϕ − − 1 ( h 1 h 2 ) {\displaystyle \phi ^{-1}(h_{1}h_{2})} . (This group is the same group G / N {\displaystyle G/N} mentioned above.) There is some congruence relation on G {\displaystyle G} for which the equivalence class of the identity element is N {\displaystyle N} .

For all n ∈ ∈ N {\displaystyle n\in N} and g ∈ ∈ G , {\displaystyle g\in G,} the commutator [ n , g ] = n − − 1 g − − 1 n g {\displaystyle [n,g]=n^{-1}g^{-1}ng} is in N .

{\displaystyle N.} [ citation needed ] Any two elements commute modulo the normal subgroup membership relation.  That is, for all g , h ∈ ∈ G , {\displaystyle g,h\in G,} g h ∈ ∈ N {\displaystyle gh\in N} if and only if h g ∈ ∈ N .

{\displaystyle hg\in N.} [ citation needed ] Examples [ edit ] For any group G , {\displaystyle G,} the trivial subgroup { e } {\displaystyle \{e\}} consisting of just the identity element of G {\displaystyle G} is always a normal subgroup of G .

{\displaystyle G.} Likewise, G {\displaystyle G} itself is always a normal subgroup of G .

{\displaystyle G.} (If these are the only normal subgroups, then G {\displaystyle G} is said to be simple .) [ 6 ] Other named normal subgroups of an arbitrary group include the center of the group (the set of elements that commute with all other elements) and the commutator subgroup [ G , G ] .

{\displaystyle [G,G].} [ 7 ] [ 8 ] More generally, since conjugation is an isomorphism, any characteristic subgroup is a normal subgroup.

[ 9 ] If G {\displaystyle G} is an abelian group then every subgroup N {\displaystyle N} of G {\displaystyle G} is normal, because g N = { g n } n ∈ ∈ N = { n g } n ∈ ∈ N = N g .

{\displaystyle gN=\{gn\}_{n\in N}=\{ng\}_{n\in N}=Ng.} More generally, for any group G {\displaystyle G} , every subgroup of the center Z ( G ) {\displaystyle Z(G)} of G {\displaystyle G} is normal in G {\displaystyle G} . (In the special case that G {\displaystyle G} is abelian, the center is all of G {\displaystyle G} , hence the fact that all subgroups of an abelian group are normal.)  A group that is not abelian but for which every subgroup is normal is called a Hamiltonian group .

[ 10 ] A concrete example of a normal subgroup is the subgroup N = { ( 1 ) , ( 123 ) , ( 132 ) } {\displaystyle N=\{(1),(123),(132)\}} of the symmetric group S 3 , {\displaystyle S_{3},} consisting of the identity and both three-cycles.  In particular, one can check that every coset of N {\displaystyle N} is either equal to N {\displaystyle N} itself or is equal to ( 12 ) N = { ( 12 ) , ( 23 ) , ( 13 ) } .

{\displaystyle (12)N=\{(12),(23),(13)\}.} On the other hand, the subgroup H = { ( 1 ) , ( 12 ) } {\displaystyle H=\{(1),(12)\}} is not normal in S 3 {\displaystyle S_{3}} since ( 123 ) H = { ( 123 ) , ( 13 ) } ≠ ≠ { ( 123 ) , ( 23 ) } = H ( 123 ) .

{\displaystyle (123)H=\{(123),(13)\}\neq \{(123),(23)\}=H(123).} [ 11 ] This illustrates the general fact that any subgroup H ≤ ≤ G {\displaystyle H\leq G} of index two is normal.

As an example of a normal subgroup within a matrix group , consider the general linear group G L n ( R ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {GL} _{n}(\mathbf {R} )} of all invertible n × × n {\displaystyle n\times n} matrices with real entries under the operation of matrix multiplication and its subgroup S L n ( R ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {SL} _{n}(\mathbf {R} )} of all n × × n {\displaystyle n\times n} matrices of determinant 1 (the special linear group ).  To see why the subgroup S L n ( R ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {SL} _{n}(\mathbf {R} )} is normal in G L n ( R ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {GL} _{n}(\mathbf {R} )} , consider any matrix X {\displaystyle X} in S L n ( R ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {SL} _{n}(\mathbf {R} )} and any invertible matrix A {\displaystyle A} .  Then using the two important identities det ( A B ) = det ( A ) det ( B ) {\displaystyle \det(AB)=\det(A)\det(B)} and det ( A − − 1 ) = det ( A ) − − 1 {\displaystyle \det(A^{-1})=\det(A)^{-1}} , one has that det ( A X A − − 1 ) = det ( A ) det ( X ) det ( A ) − − 1 = det ( X ) = 1 {\displaystyle \det(AXA^{-1})=\det(A)\det(X)\det(A)^{-1}=\det(X)=1} , and so A X A − − 1 ∈ ∈ S L n ( R ) {\displaystyle AXA^{-1}\in \mathrm {SL} _{n}(\mathbf {R} )} as well.  This means S L n ( R ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {SL} _{n}(\mathbf {R} )} is closed under conjugation in G L n ( R ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {GL} _{n}(\mathbf {R} )} , so it is a normal subgroup.

[ a ] In the Rubik's Cube group , the subgroups consisting of operations which only affect the orientations of either the corner pieces or the edge pieces are normal.

[ 12 ] The translation group is a normal subgroup of the Euclidean group in any dimension.

[ 13 ] This means: applying a rigid transformation, followed by a translation and then the inverse rigid transformation, has the same effect as a single translation. By contrast, the subgroup of all rotations about the origin is not a normal subgroup of the Euclidean group, as long as the dimension is at least 2: first translating, then rotating about the origin, and then translating back will typically not fix the origin and will therefore not have the same effect as a single rotation about the origin.

Properties [ edit ] If H {\displaystyle H} is a normal subgroup of G , {\displaystyle G,} and K {\displaystyle K} is a subgroup of G {\displaystyle G} containing H , {\displaystyle H,} then H {\displaystyle H} is a normal subgroup of K .

{\displaystyle K.} [ 14 ] A normal subgroup of a normal subgroup of a group need not be normal in the group. That is, normality is not a transitive relation . The smallest group exhibiting this phenomenon is the dihedral group of order 8.

[ 15 ] However, a characteristic subgroup of a normal subgroup is normal.

[ 16 ] A group in which normality is transitive is called a T-group .

[ 17 ] The two groups G {\displaystyle G} and H {\displaystyle H} are normal subgroups of their direct product G × × H .

{\displaystyle G\times H.} If the group G {\displaystyle G} is a semidirect product G = N ⋊ ⋊ H , {\displaystyle G=N\rtimes H,} then N {\displaystyle N} is normal in G , {\displaystyle G,} though H {\displaystyle H} need not be normal in G .

{\displaystyle G.} If M {\displaystyle M} and N {\displaystyle N} are normal subgroups of an additive group G {\displaystyle G} such that G = M + N {\displaystyle G=M+N} and M ∩ ∩ N = { 0 } {\displaystyle M\cap N=\{0\}} , then G = M ⊕ ⊕ N .

{\displaystyle G=M\oplus N.} [ 18 ] Normality is preserved under surjective homomorphisms; [ 19 ] that is, if G → → H {\displaystyle G\to H} is a surjective group homomorphism and N {\displaystyle N} is normal in G , {\displaystyle G,} then the image f ( N ) {\displaystyle f(N)} is normal in H .

{\displaystyle H.} Normality is preserved by taking inverse images ; [ 19 ] that is, if G → → H {\displaystyle G\to H} is a group homomorphism and N {\displaystyle N} is normal in H , {\displaystyle H,} then the inverse image f − − 1 ( N ) {\displaystyle f^{-1}(N)} is normal in G .

{\displaystyle G.} Normality is preserved on taking direct products ; [ 20 ] that is, if N 1 ◃ ◃ G 1 {\displaystyle N_{1}\triangleleft G_{1}} and N 2 ◃ ◃ G 2 , {\displaystyle N_{2}\triangleleft G_{2},} then N 1 × × N 2 ◃ ◃ G 1 × × G 2 .

{\displaystyle N_{1}\times N_{2}\;\triangleleft \;G_{1}\times G_{2}.} Every subgroup of index 2 is normal. More generally, a subgroup, H , {\displaystyle H,} of finite index, n , {\displaystyle n,} in G {\displaystyle G} contains a subgroup, K , {\displaystyle K,} normal in G {\displaystyle G} and of index dividing n !

{\displaystyle n!} called the normal core . In particular, if p {\displaystyle p} is the smallest prime dividing the order of G , {\displaystyle G,} then every subgroup of index p {\displaystyle p} is normal.

[ 21 ] The fact that normal subgroups of G {\displaystyle G} are precisely the kernels of group homomorphisms defined on G {\displaystyle G} accounts for some of the importance of normal subgroups; they are a way to internally classify all homomorphisms defined on a group. For example, a non-identity finite group is simple if and only if it is isomorphic to all of its non-identity homomorphic images, [ 22 ] a finite group is perfect if and only if it has no normal subgroups of prime index , and a group is imperfect if and only if the derived subgroup is not supplemented by any proper normal subgroup.

Lattice of normal subgroups [ edit ] Given two normal subgroups, N {\displaystyle N} and M , {\displaystyle M,} of G , {\displaystyle G,} their intersection N ∩ ∩ M {\displaystyle N\cap M} and their product N M = { n m : n ∈ ∈ N and m ∈ ∈ M } {\displaystyle NM=\{nm:n\in N\;{\text{ and }}\;m\in M\}} are also normal subgroups of G .

{\displaystyle G.} The normal subgroups of G {\displaystyle G} form a lattice under subset inclusion with least element , { e } , {\displaystyle \{e\},} and greatest element , G .

{\displaystyle G.} The meet of two normal subgroups, N {\displaystyle N} and M , {\displaystyle M,} in this lattice is their intersection and the join is their product.

The lattice is complete and modular .

[ 20 ] Normal subgroups, quotient groups and homomorphisms [ edit ] If N {\displaystyle N} is a normal subgroup, we can define a multiplication on cosets as follows: ( a 1 N ) ( a 2 N ) := ( a 1 a 2 ) N .

{\displaystyle \left(a_{1}N\right)\left(a_{2}N\right):=\left(a_{1}a_{2}\right)N.} This relation defines a mapping G / N × × G / N → → G / N .

{\displaystyle G/N\times G/N\to G/N.} To show that this mapping is well-defined, one needs to prove that the choice of representative elements a 1 , a 2 {\displaystyle a_{1},a_{2}} does not affect the result. To this end, consider some other representative elements a 1 ′ ∈ ∈ a 1 N , a 2 ′ ∈ ∈ a 2 N .

{\displaystyle a_{1}'\in a_{1}N,a_{2}'\in a_{2}N.} Then there are n 1 , n 2 ∈ ∈ N {\displaystyle n_{1},n_{2}\in N} such that a 1 ′ = a 1 n 1 , a 2 ′ = a 2 n 2 .

{\displaystyle a_{1}'=a_{1}n_{1},a_{2}'=a_{2}n_{2}.} It follows that a 1 ′ a 2 ′ N = a 1 n 1 a 2 n 2 N = a 1 a 2 n 1 ′ n 2 N = a 1 a 2 N , {\displaystyle a_{1}'a_{2}'N=a_{1}n_{1}a_{2}n_{2}N=a_{1}a_{2}n_{1}'n_{2}N=a_{1}a_{2}N,} where we also used the fact that N {\displaystyle N} is a normal subgroup, and therefore there is n 1 ′ ∈ ∈ N {\displaystyle n_{1}'\in N} such that n 1 a 2 = a 2 n 1 ′ .

{\displaystyle n_{1}a_{2}=a_{2}n_{1}'.} This proves that this product is a well-defined mapping between cosets.

With this operation, the set of cosets is itself a group, called the quotient group and denoted with G / N .

{\displaystyle G/N.} There is a natural homomorphism , f : G → → G / N , {\displaystyle f:G\to G/N,} given by f ( a ) = a N .

{\displaystyle f(a)=aN.} This homomorphism maps N {\displaystyle N} into the identity element of G / N , {\displaystyle G/N,} which is the coset e N = N , {\displaystyle eN=N,} [ 23 ] that is, ker ⁡ ⁡ ( f ) = N .

{\displaystyle \ker(f)=N.} In general, a group homomorphism, f : G → → H {\displaystyle f:G\to H} sends subgroups of G {\displaystyle G} to subgroups of H .

{\displaystyle H.} Also, the preimage of any subgroup of H {\displaystyle H} is a subgroup of G .

{\displaystyle G.} We call the preimage of the trivial group { e } {\displaystyle \{e\}} in H {\displaystyle H} the kernel of the homomorphism and denote it by ker ⁡ ⁡ f .

{\displaystyle \ker f.} As it turns out, the kernel is always normal and the image of G , f ( G ) , {\displaystyle G,f(G),} is always isomorphic to G / ker ⁡ ⁡ f {\displaystyle G/\ker f} (the first isomorphism theorem ).

[ 24 ] In fact, this correspondence is a bijection between the set of all quotient groups of G , G / N , {\displaystyle G,G/N,} and the set of all homomorphic images of G {\displaystyle G} ( up to isomorphism).

[ 25 ] It is also easy to see that the kernel of the quotient map, f : G → → G / N , {\displaystyle f:G\to G/N,} is N {\displaystyle N} itself, so the normal subgroups are precisely the kernels of homomorphisms with domain G .

Both arguments also work over the complex numbers , or indeed over an arbitrary field .
