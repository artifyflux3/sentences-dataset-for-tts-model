A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun , thereby totally or partly obscuring the image of the Sun for a viewer on Earth. A total solar eclipse occurs when the Moon's apparent diameter is larger than the Sun's, blocking all direct sunlight, turning day into darkness. Totality occurs in a narrow path across Earth's surface, with the partial solar eclipse visible over a surrounding region thousands of kilometres wide. Occurring about 6.5 days after perigee (on August 17, 1868, at 22:35 UTC), the Moon's apparent diameter was larger.

[ 1 ] The path of totality was visible from parts of modern-day Ethiopia , Eritrea , Djibouti , Yemen , India , the Andaman and Nicobar Islands , Myanmar , Thailand , Cambodia , Vietnam , Malaysia , Brunei , Indonesia , and Papua New Guinea . A partial solar eclipse was also visible for parts of East Africa , the Middle East , Central Asia , South Asia , Southeast Asia , Australia , and western Oceania .

The eclipse was predicted more precisely by King Mongkut of Thailand than it was by French astronomers. The eclipse allowed for the discovery of helium by both Pierre Janssen and Norman Lockyer , who observed Solar prominences with spectroscopes .

Several expeditions were sent to observe the eclipse.

One of two expeditions from Germany was sent to Aden. The expedition was led by Gustav Spörer .

[ 2 ] The second expedition was sent to the west coast of India. The expedition was led by Friedrich Tietjen .

[ 3 ] Captain Bullock observed from the Celebes sea , sketching the appearance of the corona, [ 4 ] while Gustav Fritsch accompanied an expedition to Aden .

[ 5 ] Discovery of helium [ edit ] French astronomer Pierre Janssen observed the eclipse from Guntur in Madras State , British India . It was the first total eclipse since Gustav Kirchhoff 's 1859 theory that the Fraunhofer lines in the solar spectrum correspond to the emission line of the different chemical elements present in the Sun. Correspondingly, Janssen observed the eclipse with the aid of a spectroscope . He noticed a bright yellow line ( λ = 587.49 nm) in the spectra of the solar prominences that could not be due to sodium as had previously been assumed, and was subsequently able to observe the same line even without the need for an eclipse. The same result was found independently by British astronomer Norman Lockyer , and both Janssen's and Lockyer's communications were presented to the French Academy of Sciences on October 26, 1868.

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] King Mongkut's calculation [ edit ] King Mongkut and party viewing a solar eclipse on the 18 August 1868. The King seated center in the middle of the pavilion, Sir Harry Ord (Governor of the Straits Settlements at Singapore) and the British party stands around, includes royal officials kneeling.

King Mongkut , Rama IV of Siam , predicted and calculated the solar eclipse two years prior.

[ 8 ] The calculations were correct as to the place, time, and type of the solar eclipse that would occur. His calculations were better — by about two seconds  — than those of the French astronomers, who acknowledged his accuracy. Mongkut was exposed to malaria around this time, developing chills and fever. He died a month and a half after the eclipse, on October 1.

[ 9 ] According to the Thai Astronomical Society and NASA, this eclipse is known as "The King of Siam's eclipse".

[ 8 ] [ 10 ] Eclipse details [ edit ] Shown below are two tables displaying details about this particular solar eclipse. The first table outlines times at which the moon's penumbra or umbra attains the specific parameter, and the second table describes various other parameters pertaining to this eclipse.

Only two (or occasionally three) eclipse seasons occur each year, and each season lasts about 35 days and repeats just short of six months (173 days) later; thus two full eclipse seasons always occur each year. Either two or three eclipses happen each eclipse season. In the sequence below, each eclipse is separated by a fortnight .

An eclipse in a semester series of solar eclipses repeats approximately every 177 days and 4 hours (a semester) at alternating nodes of the Moon's orbit.

[ 12 ] The partial solar eclipses on April 15, 1866 and October 8, 1866 occur in the previous lunar year eclipse set, and the solar eclipses on June 28, 1870 (partial) and December 22, 1870 (total) occur in the next lunar year eclipse set.

The series started with a partial solar eclipse on July 13, 1219. It contains annular eclipses from November 20, 1435 through January 13, 1526; a hybrid eclipse on January 24, 1544; and total eclipses from February 3, 1562 through June 21, 2373. The series ends at member 72 as a partial eclipse on September 5, 2499. Its eclipses are tabulated in three columns; every third eclipse in the same column is one exeligmos apart, so they all cast shadows over approximately the same parts of the Earth.

The longest duration of annularity was produced by member 25 at 1 minutes, 14 seconds on November 30, 1453, and the longest duration of totality was produced by member 61 at 6 minutes, 50 seconds on August 7, 1850. All eclipses in this series occur at the Moon’s ascending node of orbit.

[ 13 ] Series members 34–55 occur between 1801 and 2200: 34 35 36 July 17, 1814 July 27, 1832 August 7, 1850 37 38 39 August 18, 1868 August 29, 1886 September 9, 1904 40 41 42 September 21, 1922 October 1, 1940 October 12, 1958 43 44 45 October 23, 1976 November 3, 1994 November 13, 2012 46 47 48 November 25, 2030 December 5, 2048 December 17, 2066 49 50 51 December 27, 2084 January 8, 2103 January 19, 2121 52 53 54 January 30, 2139 February 9, 2157 February 21, 2175 55 March 3, 2193 Metonic series [ edit ] The metonic series repeats eclipses every 19 years (6939.69 days), lasting about 5 cycles. Eclipses occur in nearly the same calendar date. In addition, the octon subseries repeats 1/5 of that or every 3.8 years (1387.94 days). All eclipses in this table occur at the Moon's ascending node.

24 eclipse events between March 25, 1819 and August 20, 1906 March 25–26 January 11–12 October 30–31 August 18–20 June 6–7 107 109 111 113 115 March 25, 1819 January 12, 1823 October 31, 1826 August 18, 1830 June 7, 1834 117 119 121 123 125 March 25, 1838 January 11, 1842 October 30, 1845 August 18, 1849 June 6, 1853 127 129 131 133 135 March 25, 1857 January 11, 1861 October 30, 1864 August 18, 1868 June 6, 1872 137 139 141 143 145 March 25, 1876 January 11, 1880 October 30, 1883 August 19, 1887 June 6, 1891 147 149 151 153 March 26, 1895 January 11, 1899 October 31, 1902 August 20, 1906 Tritos series [ edit ] This eclipse is a part of a tritos cycle, repeating at alternating nodes every 135 synodic months (≈ 3986.63 days, or 11 years minus 1 month). Their appearance and longitude are irregular due to a lack of synchronization with the anomalistic month (period of perigee), but groupings of 3 tritos cycles (≈ 33 years minus 3 months) come close (≈ 434.044 anomalistic months), so eclipses are similar in these groupings.

Their appearance and longitude are irregular due to a lack of synchronization with the anomalistic month (period of perigee). However, groupings of 3 inex cycles (≈ 87 years minus 2 months) comes close (≈ 1,151.02 anomalistic months), so eclipses are similar in these groupings.
