He lived in the first half of the 2nd century.

[ 1 ] He appears to have written commentaries on most of the works of Aristotle .

Simplicius [ 2 ] says he was the teacher of Alexander of Aphrodisias . We learn from Alexander's commentary on the Prior Analytics that Herminus had worked on Aristotle's syllogistic system, adding innovations which Alexander disapproved of.

[ 3 ] His writings, of which nothing remains, are frequently referred to by Boethius , who mentions a treatise by him, On Interpretation ( Greek : περὶ Ἑρμηνείας ), as also Analytics and Topics .

A Stoic philosopher called Herminus is mentioned by Longinus in the preface to his book On Ends . This Herminus had been a teacher when Longinus was young (c. 230).
