[ 11 ] It is the sixth-most populous city in the United States with a population of 1.6 million at the 2020 census , while the Philadelphia metropolitan area (sometimes called the Delaware Valley ) with 6.33 million residents is the nation's ninth-largest metropolitan area .

[ 12 ] Philadelphia is known for its culture , cuisine , and history , maintaining contemporary influence in business and industry , culture, sports, and music.

[ 13 ] [ 14 ] Philadelphia was founded in 1682 by William Penn , an English Quaker and advocate of religious freedom , and served as the capital of the colonial era Province of Pennsylvania .

[ 3 ] [ 15 ] It then played a vital role during the American Revolution and Revolutionary War . It served as the central meeting place for the nation's Founding Fathers in hosting the First Continental Congress (1774) and the Second Continental Congress , during which the Founders formed the Continental Army , elected George Washington as its commander, and adopted the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776. During the Revolutionary War's Philadelphia campaign , the city briefly fell to the British Army , which occupied Philadelphia for nine months from September 1777 to June 1778.

[ 16 ] Following the end of the Revolutionary War, the U.S. Constitution was ratified at the Philadelphia Convention . Philadelphia remained the nation's largest city until 1790, and it served as the nation's first capital from May 10, 1775, until December 12, 1776, and on four subsequent occasions until 1800, when construction of the new national capital in Washington, D.C. was completed.

[ 17 ] With 17 four-year universities and colleges in the city, Philadelphia is one of the nation's leading centers for higher education and academic research.

[ 18 ] [ 19 ] The city hosts more outdoor sculptures and murals than any other city in the nation.

[ 20 ] [ 21 ] Fairmount Park , when combined with adjacent Wissahickon Valley Park in the same watershed , is 2,052 acres (830 ha), representing one of the nation's largest and the world's 55th-largest urban park .

[ 22 ] With five professional sports teams and one of the nation's most loyal and passionate fan bases, Philadelphia is often ranked as the nation's best city for professional sports fans.

[ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ] The city has a culturally and philanthropically active LGBTQ+ community . Philadelphia also has played an influential historic and ongoing role in the development and evolution of American music, especially R&B , soul , and rock.

[ 27 ] [ 28 ] As of 2023 [update] , the Philadelphia metropolitan area had a gross metropolitan product of US$557.6 billion [ 9 ] and is home to 13 Fortune 500 corporate headquarters.

[ 29 ] Metropolitan Philadelphia ranks as one of the nation's Big Five venture capital hubs, facilitated by its proximity to both the financial ecosystems of New York City and the regulatory environment of Washington, D.C.

[ 30 ] Metropolitan Philadelphia is also a biotechnology hub. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange , owned by Nasdaq since 2008, is the nation's oldest stock exchange and a global leader in options trading.

[ 31 ] 30th Street Station , the city's primary rail station, is the third-busiest Amtrak hub in the nation with over 4.1 million passengers in 2023. The city's multimodal transportation and logistics infrastructure includes Philadelphia International Airport , [ 32 ] the PhilaPort seaport ; [ 33 ] and Interstate 95 , the spine of the north–south highway system along the U.S. East Coast .

Philadelphia is a city of many firsts, including the nation's first library (1731), [ 34 ] hospital (1751), [ 34 ] medical school (1765), [ 35 ] national capital (1774), [ 36 ] university (by some accounts) (1779), [ 37 ] central bank (1781), [ 38 ] stock exchange (1790), [ 34 ] zoo (1874), [ 39 ] and business school (1881).

[ 41 ] [ 42 ] [ 19 ] From the city's 17th century founding through the present, Philadelphia has been the birthplace or home to an extensive number of prominent and influential Americans .

History Main article: History of Philadelphia For a chronological guide, see Timeline of Philadelphia .

See also: List of National Historic Landmarks in Philadelphia and National Register of Historic Places listings in Philadelphia Native peoples Prior to the arrival of Europeans in the early 17th century, the Lenape , an Indian tribe also known as the Delaware Indians, lived in the village of Shackamaxon in present-day Philadelphia and the surrounding area.

[ 43 ] The Lenape historically lived along the Delaware River watershed , western Long Island , and the Lower Hudson Valley .

[ a ] Most Lenape were pushed out of the region during the 18th century as the original Thirteen Colonies expanded, which was further exacerbated by losses from intertribal conflicts.

[ 43 ] Lenape communities were also weakened by newly introduced diseases, mainly smallpox , and conflicts with Europeans. The Iroquois occasionally fought the Lenape. Surviving Lenape moved west into the upper Ohio River basin. Following the American Revolutionary War and the subsequent establishment of the United States, the Lenape began moving further west. In the 1860s, the U.S. federal government sent most remaining Lenape in the eastern United States to the Indian Territory in present-day Oklahoma and surrounding territories as part of the Indian removal policy.

Colonial era William Penn (holding paper) and King Charles II depicted in The Birth of Pennsylvania 1680 , a portrait by Jean Leon Gerome Ferris William Penn's 1682 Treaty of Shackamaxon with the Lenape tribe depicted in Penn's Treaty with the Indians , a 1772 portrait by Benjamin West A 1683 portrait of Philadelphia by Thomas Holme , believed to be the city's first map Europeans first entered Philadelphia and the surrounding Delaware Valley in the early 17th century. The first settlements were founded by Dutch colonists , who built Fort Nassau on the Delaware River in 1623 in what is now Brooklawn, New Jersey . The Dutch considered the entire Delaware River valley to be part of their New Netherland colony. In 1638, Swedish settlers led by renegade Dutch established the colony of New Sweden at Fort Christina , located in present-day Wilmington, Delaware , and quickly spread out in the valley. In 1644, New Sweden supported the Susquehannocks in their war against Maryland colonists.

[ 44 ] In 1648, the Dutch built Fort Beversreede on the west bank of the Delaware, south of the Schuylkill River near the present-day Eastwick section of Philadelphia, to reassert their dominion over the area. The Swedes responded by building Fort Nya Korsholm , or New Korsholm , named after a town in Finland with a Swedish majority.

In 1655, a Dutch military campaign led by New Netherland Director-General Peter Stuyvesant took control of the Swedish colony, ending its claim to independence. The Swedish and Finnish settlers continued to have their own militia , religion, and court, and to enjoy substantial autonomy under the Dutch. An English fleet captured the New Netherland colony in 1664, though the situation did not change substantially until 1682, when the area was included in William Penn 's charter for Pennsylvania.

[ 45 ] In 1681, in partial repayment of a debt, Charles II of England granted Penn a charter for what would become the Pennsylvania colony . Despite the royal charter, Penn bought the land from the local Lenape in an effort to establish good terms with the Native Americans and ensure peace for the colony.

[ 46 ] Penn made a treaty of friendship with Lenape chief Tammany under an elm tree at Shackamaxon , in what is now the city's Fishtown neighborhood.

[ 3 ] Penn named the city Philadelphia, which is Greek for 'brotherly love', derived from the Ancient Greek terms φίλος phílos ('beloved, dear') and ἀδελφός adelphós ('brother, brotherly'). There were a number of cities named Philadelphia ( Φιλαδέλφεια ) in the Eastern Mediterranean during the Greek and Roman periods, including modern Alaşehir , mentioned as the site of an early Christian congregation in the Book of Revelation . As a Quaker , Penn had experienced religious persecution and wanted his colony to be a place where anyone could worship freely. This tolerance, which exceeded that of other colonies, led to better relations with the local native tribes and fostered Philadelphia's rapid growth into America's most important city.

[ 47 ] Penn planned a city on the Delaware River to serve as a port and place for government. Hoping that Philadelphia would become more like an English rural town instead of a city, Penn laid out roads on a grid plan to keep houses and businesses spread far apart with areas for gardens and orchards .

The city's inhabitants did not follow Penn's plans, however, and instead crowded the present-day Port of Philadelphia on the Delaware River and subdivided and resold their lots.

[ 48 ] Before Penn left Philadelphia for the final time, he issued the Charter of 1701 establishing it as a city. Though poor at first, Philadelphia became an important trading center with tolerable living conditions by the 1750s.

Benjamin Franklin , a leading citizen, helped improve city services and founded new ones that were among the first in the nation, including a fire company , library , and hospital .

A number of philosophical societies were formed, which were centers of the city's intellectual life, including the Philadelphia Society for Promoting Agriculture (1785), the Pennsylvania Society for the Encouragement of Manufactures and the Useful Arts (1787), the Academy of Natural Sciences (1812), and the Franklin Institute (1824).

[ 49 ] These societies developed and financed new industries that attracted skilled and knowledgeable immigrants from Europe.

American Revolution See also: Pennsylvania in the American Revolution and Philadelphia campaign The Committee of Five presenting their draft of the Declaration of Independence in Independence Hall on June 28, 1776, depicted in an 1818 painting by John Trumbull ; historian Joseph Ellis called the Declaration "the most potent and consequential words in American history." [ 50 ] President's House on Market Street served as the presidential mansion for the nation's first two presidents, George Washington and John Adams , from 1790 to 1800 prior to the completion of the White House and the development of Washington, D.C. as the nation's new capital.

Independence Hall on Chestnut Street between 5th and 6th streets, where the Declaration of Independence was signed and the Constitution was ratified, on July 4, 1776, and June 21, 1788, respectively Philadelphia's importance and central location in the colonies made it a natural center for America's revolutionaries . By the 1750s, Philadelphia surpassed Boston as the largest city and busiest port in British America , and the second-largest city in the entire British Empire after London.

[ 51 ] [ 52 ] In 1774, as resentment of the British government's policies towards the colonies and support for independence began burgeoning in the colonies, Philadelphia hosted the First Continental Congress at Carpenters' Hall , and 12 of the original 13 colonies sent delegates to the Congress.

From 1775 to 1781, Philadelphia hosted the Second Continental Congress , [ 53 ] whose 56 delegated unanimously adopted the Declaration of Independence inside what was then called Pennsylvania State House and was later renamed Independence Hall . Written predominantly by Thomas Jefferson from his second-floor apartment on Market Street within walking distance of Independence Hall, the Declaration has been described by Pulitzer Prize -winning historian Joseph Ellis as "the most potent and consequential words in American history," [ 16 ] and its adoption represented a declaration of war against Great Britain . Since the Declaration's July 4, 1776, adoption, its signing has been cited globally and repeatedly by various peoples of the world seeking independence and liberty. It also has been, since its adoption, the basis for annual celebration by Americans; in 1938, this celebration of the Declaration was formalized as Independence Day , one of only eleven designated U.S. federal holidays .

After George Washington 's defeat at the Battle of Brandywine in Chadds Ford Township , on September 11, 1777, during the Philadelphia campaign , the revolutionary capital of Philadelphia was defenseless, and the city prepared for what was perceived to be an inevitable British attack. Because bells could easily be recast into munitions, the Liberty Bell , then known as the Pennsylvania State Bell, and bells from two Philadelphia churches, Christ Church and St. Peter's Church , were hastily taken down and transported by heavily guarded wagon train out of the city. The Liberty Bell was taken to Zion German Reformed Church in Northampton Town, which is present-day Allentown , where it was hidden under the church's floor boards for nine months from September 1777 until departure of British forces from Philadelphia in June 1778.

[ 54 ] Two Revolutionary War battles, the Siege of Fort Mifflin , fought between September 26 and November 16, 1777, and the Battle of Germantown , fought on October 4, 1777, took place within Philadelphia's city limits.

In Philadelphia, the Second Continental Congress adopted the Articles of Confederation on November 15, 1777. Independence Hall in Philadelphia was the meeting place for the Constitutional Convention , which ratified the Constitution on September 17, 1787, which is now the longest-standing codified national constitution.

Philadelphia served as capital of the United States for most of the colonial and early post-colonial period. including for a decade, from 1790 to 1800, while Washington, D.C., was being constructed and prepared to serve as the new national capital, and on five prior occasions between 1776 and 1790.

[ 55 ] In 1793, the largest yellow fever epidemic in U.S. history killed approximately 4,000 to 5,000 people in Philadelphia, or about ten percent of the city's population at the time.

[ 56 ] [ 57 ] The capital of the United States was moved to Washington, D.C. in 1800 upon completion of the White House and U.S. Capitol buildings.

The state capital was moved from Philadelphia to Lancaster in 1799, then ultimately to Harrisburg in 1812. Philadelphia remained the nation's largest city until the late 18th century. It also was the nation's financial and cultural center until ultimately being eclipsed in total population by New York City in 1790. In 1816, the city's free Black community founded the African Methodist Episcopal Church , the first independent Black denomination in the country, and the first Black Episcopal Church . The free Black community also established many schools for its children with the help of Quakers . Large-scale construction projects for new roads, canals , and railroads made Philadelphia the first major industrial city in the United States.

19th century Further information: Pennsylvania in the American Civil War Opening day ceremonies at the Centennial Exposition at Memorial Hall in Fairmount Park in 1876, the first world fair held in the U.S. on the centennial anniversary of the nation's founding Throughout the 19th century, Philadelphia hosted a variety of industries and businesses; the largest was the textile industry . Major corporations in the 19th and early 20th centuries included the Baldwin Locomotive Works , William Cramp & Sons Shipbuilding Company , and the Pennsylvania Railroad .

[ 58 ] Established in 1870, the Philadelphia Conveyancers' Association was chartered by the state in 1871. Along with the U.S. Centennial in 1876, the city's industry was celebrated in the Centennial Exposition , the first official World's fair in the U.S.

Immigrants, mostly from Ireland and Germany, settled in Philadelphia and the surrounding districts. These immigrants were largely responsible for the first general strike in North America in 1835, in which workers in the city won the ten-hour workday. The city was a destination for thousands of Irish immigrants fleeing the Great Famine in the 1840s; housing for them was developed south of South Street and later occupied by succeeding immigrants. They established a network of Catholic churches and schools and dominated the Catholic clergy for decades. Anti-Irish, anti-Catholic nativist riots erupted in Philadelphia in 1844. The rise in population of the surrounding districts helped lead to the Act of Consolidation of 1854 , which extended the city limits from the 2 square miles (5.2 km 2 ) of Center City to the roughly 134 square miles (350 km 2 ) of Philadelphia County .

[ 59 ] [ 60 ] In the latter half of the 19th century and leading into the 20th century, immigrants from Russia, Eastern Europe, and Italy, and African Americans from the southern U.S.

settled in the city.

[ 61 ] Philadelphia was represented by the Washington Grays in the American Civil War . The African-American population of Philadelphia increased from 31,699 to 219,559 between 1880 and 1930, largely stemming from the Great Migration from the South .

[ 62 ] [ 63 ] 20th century By the 20th century, Philadelphia had an entrenched Republican political machine and a complacent population.

[ clarification needed ] [ 64 ] In 1910, a general strike shut down the entire city.

[ 65 ] In 1917, following outrage over the election-year murder of a Philadelphia police officer, the City Council shrank from two houses to just one.

[ 66 ] In July 1919, Philadelphia was one of more than 36 industrial cities nationally to suffer a race riot during Red Summer in post- World War I unrest as recent immigrants competed with Blacks for jobs. In the 1920s, the public flouting of Prohibition laws, organized crime , mob violence, and corrupt police involvement in illegal activities led to the appointment of Brig. Gen.

Smedley Butler of the U.S. Marine Corps as the city's director of public safety, but political pressure still prevented long-term success in fighting crime and corruption.

[ 67 ] In 1940, non-Hispanic whites constituted 86.8% of the city's population.

[ 68 ] In 1950, the population peaked at more than two million residents, then began to decline with the restructuring of industry that led to the loss of many middle-class union jobs. In addition, suburbanization enticed many affluent residents to depart the city for its outlying railroad commuting towns and newer housing. The resulting reduction in Philadelphia's tax base and the resources of local government caused the city to struggle through a long period of adjustment, and it approached bankruptcy by the late 1980s.

[ 69 ] [ 70 ] In 1985, the MOVE Bombing of the Cobbs Creek neighborhood by city helicopters occurred, killing 11 and destroying 61 homes.

[ 71 ] Revitalization and gentrification of neighborhoods began in the late 1970s and continues into the 21st century with much of the development occurring in the Center City and University City neighborhoods. But this expanded a shortage of affordable housing in the city. After many manufacturers and businesses left Philadelphia or shut down, the city started attracting service businesses and began to market itself more aggressively as a tourist destination. Contemporary glass-and-granite skyscrapers were built in Center City beginning in the 1980s. Historic areas such as Old City and Society Hill were renovated during the reformist mayoral era of the 1950s through the 1980s, making both areas among the most desirable Center City neighborhoods. Immigrants from around the world began to enter the U.S. through Philadelphia as their gateway, leading to a reversal of the city's population decline between 1950 and 2000, during which it lost about 25 percent of its residents.

[ 72 ] [ 73 ] 21st century Philadelphia eventually began experiencing a growth in its population in 2007, which continued with incremental annual increases through the present.

[ 74 ] [ 75 ] A migration pattern has been established from New York City to Philadelphia by residents opting for a large city with relative proximity and a lower cost of living .

[ 76 ] [ 77 ] Geography Topography Philadelphia's geographic center is about 40° 0′ 34″ north latitude and 75° 8′ 0″ west longitude. The 40th parallel north passes through neighborhoods in Northeast Philadelphia , North Philadelphia , and West Philadelphia including Fairmount Park . The city encompasses 142.71 square miles (369.62 km 2 ), of which 134.18 square miles (347.52 km 2 ) is land and 8.53 square miles (22.09 km 2 ), or 6%, is water.

[ 78 ] Natural bodies of water include the Delaware and Schuylkill rivers, lakes in Franklin Delano Roosevelt Park , and Cobbs , Wissahickon , and Pennypack creeks. The largest artificial body of water is East Park Reservoir in Fairmount Park .

The lowest point is sea level and the highest point is in Chestnut Hill , about 446 feet (136 m) above sea level on Summit Street near the intersection of Germantown Avenue and Bethlehem Pike at: 40.07815 N, 75.20747 W.

[ 79 ] [ 80 ] Philadelphia is located on the Atlantic Seaboard Fall Line that separates the Atlantic Plain from the Piedmont .

[ 81 ] The Schuylkill River's rapids at East Falls were inundated by completion of the dam at Fairmount Water Works .

[ 82 ] The city is the seat of its own county . The city is bordered by six adjacent counties: Montgomery to the northwest; Bucks to the north and northeast; Burlington County, New Jersey to the east; Camden County, New Jersey to the southeast; Gloucester County, New Jersey to the south; and Delaware County to the southwest.

Cityscape See also: Architecture of Philadelphia and List of tallest buildings in Philadelphia City planning See also: List of Philadelphia neighborhoods The skyline of Philadelphia seen from the northwest on Spring Garden Street Bridge over the Schuylkill River in April 2018 (annotated version) Philadelphia's skyline at twilight from the southwest on South Street Bridge with the Schuylkill River on the left in July 2016 (annotated version) Philadelphia was created in the 17th century, following the plan by William Penn 's surveyor Thomas Holme .

Center City is structured with long, straight streets running nearly due east–west and north–south, forming a grid pattern between the Delaware and Schuylkill rivers that is aligned with their courses. The original city plan was designed to allow for easy travel and to keep residences separated by open space that would help prevent the spread of fire.

[ 83 ] In keeping with the idea of a "Greene Countrie Towne", and inspired by the many types of trees that grew in the region, Penn named many of the east–west streets for local trees.

[ 84 ] Penn planned the creation of five public parks in the city which were renamed in 1824.

[ 83 ] Centre Square was renamed Penn Square ; [ 85 ] Northeast Square was renamed Franklin Square ; Southeast Square was renamed Washington Square ; Southwest Square was renamed Rittenhouse Square ; and Northwest Square was renamed Logan Circle/Square .

[ 86 ] Center City had an estimated 183,240 residents as of 2015 [update] , making it the second-most populated downtown area in the United States after Midtown Manhattan in New York City.

[ 87 ] Philadelphia's neighborhoods are divided into six large sections that surround Center City: North Philadelphia , Northeast Philadelphia , South Philadelphia , Southwest Philadelphia , West Philadelphia , and Northwest Philadelphia . The city's geographic boundaries have been largely unchanged since these neighborhoods were consolidated in 1854. However, each of these large areas contains numerous neighborhoods, some of whose boundaries derive from the boroughs, townships, and other communities that constituted Pennsylvania County before their inclusion within the city.

[ 88 ] The City Planning Commission , tasked with guiding growth and development of the city, has divided the city into 18 planning districts as part of the Philadelphia2035 physical development plan.

[ 89 ] [ 90 ] Much of the city's 1980 zoning code was overhauled from 2007 to 2012 as part of a joint effort between former mayors John F. Street and Michael Nutter . The zoning changes were intended to rectify incorrect zoning maps to facilitate future community development, as the city forecasts an additional 100,000 residents and 40,000 jobs will be added by 2035.

The Philadelphia Housing Authority (PHA) is the largest landlord in Pennsylvania. Established in 1937, the PHA is the nation's fourth-largest housing authority, serving about 81,000 people with affordable housing, while employing 1,400 on a budget of $371 million.

[ 91 ] The Philadelphia Parking Authority is responsible for ensuring adequate parking for city residents, businesses, and visitors.

[ 92 ] Architecture Main articles: Architecture of Philadelphia and List of tallest buildings in Philadelphia Chestnut Street in Center City at night in February 2016 Philadelphia City Hall at night in December 2012 Two of Center City Philadelphia's most prominent high-rise buildings, One Liberty Place , built between 1985 and 1987 (in background), and Philadelphia City Hall , built between 1871 and 1901 (in foreground) Philadelphia's architectural history dates back to colonial times and includes a wide range of styles. The earliest structures were constructed with logs , but brick structures were common by 1700. During the 18th century, the cityscape was dominated by Georgian architecture , including Independence Hall and Christ Church .

In the first decades of the 19th century, Federal and Greek Revival architecture were the dominant styles produced by Philadelphia architects such as Benjamin Latrobe , William Strickland , John Haviland , John Notman , Thomas Walter , and Samuel Sloan .

[ 93 ] Frank Furness is considered Philadelphia's greatest architect of the second half of the 19th century. His contemporaries included John McArthur Jr.

, Addison Hutton , Wilson Eyre , the Wilson Brothers , and Horace Trumbauer . In 1871, construction began on the Second Empire -style Philadelphia City Hall . The Philadelphia Historical Commission was created in 1955 to preserve the cultural and architectural history of the city. The commission maintains the Philadelphia Register of Historic Places , adding historic buildings, structures, sites, objects and districts as it sees fit.

[ 94 ] In 1932, Philadelphia became home to the first modern International Style skyscraper in the United States, the PSFS Building , designed by George Howe and William Lescaze . The 548 ft (167 m) City Hall remained the tallest building in the city until 1987 when One Liberty Place was completed. Numerous glass and granite skyscrapers were built in Center City beginning in the late 1980s. In 2007, the Comcast Center surpassed One Liberty Place to become the city's tallest building. The Comcast Technology Center was completed in 2018, reaching a height of 1,121 ft (342 m), as the tallest building in the United States outside of Manhattan and Chicago.

[ 95 ] For much of Philadelphia's history, the typical home has been the row house . The row house was introduced to the United States via Philadelphia in the early 19th century and, for a time, row houses built elsewhere in the United States were known as "Philadelphia rows".

[ 93 ] A variety of row houses are found throughout the city, from Federal-style continuous blocks in Old City and Society Hill to Victorian-style homes in North Philadelphia to twin row houses in West Philadelphia . While newer homes have been built recently, much of the housing dates to the 18th, 19th, and early 20th centuries, which has created problems such as urban decay and vacant lots. Some neighborhoods, including Northern Liberties and Society Hill, have been rehabilitated through gentrification .

[ 96 ] [ 97 ] Elfreth's Alley , first developed in 1703, is the nation's oldest residential street.

[ 98 ] Carpenters' Hall , built between 1770 and 1774 in Georgian architecture style The Second Bank of the United States , built between 1818 and 1824, exhibiting Greek Revival architecture Second Empire -style Philadelphia City Hall , built between 1871 and 1901, on South Broad Street Parks See also: Drinking fountains in Philadelphia , Fairmount Park , and List of parks in Philadelphia Philadelphia's Fairmount Park on the Schuylkill River , the city's largest and one of the world's largest public parks As of 2014 [update] , the city's total park space, including municipal, state, and federal parks in the city, amounts to 11,211 acres (17.5 sq mi).

[ 22 ] Philadelphia's largest park is Fairmount Park , which includes the Philadelphia Zoo and encompasses 2,052 acres (3.2 sq mi) of the total parkland. Fairmount Park's adjacent Wissahickon Valley Park contains 2,042 acres (3.2 sq mi).

[ 99 ] Fairmount Park, when combined with Wissahickon Valley Park, is one of the largest contiguous urban park areas in the U.S.

[ 22 ] The two parks, along with the Colonial Revival , Georgian and Federal -style mansions in them, have been listed as one entity on the National Register of Historic Places since 1972.

The refusal led to the prospective buyer terminating its offer.

[ 370 ] [ 371 ] Telecommunications See also: Area codes 215, 267, and 445 Southeastern Pennsylvania was assigned the 215 area code in 1947 when the North American Numbering Plan of the Bell System went into effect. The geographic area covered by the code was split nearly in half in 1994 when area code 610 was created, with the city and its northern suburbs retaining 215.

Overlay area code 267 was added to the 215 service area in 1997, and 484 was added to the 610 area in 1999. A plan in 2001 to introduce a third overlay code to both service areas, area code 445 to 215 and area code 835 to 610, was delayed and later rescinded.

[ 372 ] Area code 445 was implemented as an overlay for area codes 215 and 267 starting on February 3, 2018.

The Sister Cities Park, a site of 0.5 acres (0.20 ha) at 18th and Benjamin Franklin Parkway in Logan Square , was dedicated in June 1976. The park was built to commemorate Philadelphia's first two sister city relationships, with Tel Aviv and Florence . Toruń Triangle, honoring the sister city relationship with Toruń , Poland, was constructed in 1976, west of the United Way building at 18th Street and Benjamin Franklin Parkway . Sister Cities Park was redesigned and reopened in 2012, featuring an interactive fountain honoring Philadelphia's sister and partnership cities, a café and visitor center, children's play area, outdoor garden, boat pond, and a pavilion built to environmentally friendly standards.

[ 386 ] [ 387 ] The Chinatown Gate, erected in 1984 and crafted by artisans from Tianjin , stands astride 10th Street, on the north side of its intersection with Arch Street , as a symbol of the sister city relationship. The CDI of Philadelphia has participated in the U.S. Department of State 's "Partners for Peace" project with Mosul , Iraq, [ 388 ] and in accepting visiting delegations from dozens of other countries.

These terrains encompass from South to North and then counter-clockwise: the shores from the east-shore mouth of the river and the sea coast to Western Long Island (all of both colonial New Amsterdam and New Sweden ), and portions of Western Connecticut up to the latitude of the Massachusetts corner of today's boundaries—making the eastern bounds of their influence, thence their region extended: westerly past the region around Albany, New York to the Susquehanna River side of the Catskills , then southerly through the eastern Poconos outside the rival Susquehannock lands past Eastern Pennsylvania then southerly past the site of Colonial Philadelphia past the west bank mouth of the Delaware and extending south from that point along a stretch of sea coast in northern colonial Delaware .

The Susquehanna - Delaware River system's watershed divided the frequently contested hunting grounds between the rival Susquehannock people and Lenape peoples, and the Catskills and Berkshires played a similar boundary role in the northern regions of their original colonial era range.

The February 2010 storms contributed to a single month record accumulation of 51.5 in (131 cm). If no snow fell outside of February that season, 2009–10 would still rank as 5th-snowiest. See the Franklin Institute for a visual representation of seasonal snowfall.

^ Mean monthly maxima and minima (i.e. the highest and lowest temperature readings during an entire month or year) calculated based on data at said location from 1991 to 2020.

^ Official temperature and precipitation measurements for Philadelphia were taken at the Weather Bureau Office in downtown from January 1872 to 19 June 1940, and at Philadelphia Int'l from 20 June 1940 to the present.

[ 110 ] Snowfall and snow depth records date to 1 January 1884 and 1 October 1948, respectively.

[ 104 ] In 2006, snowfall measurements were moved to National Park, New Jersey directly across the Delaware River from the airport.
