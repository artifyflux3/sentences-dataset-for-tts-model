81000538 Pennsylvania Historical Marker Official name Pennsylvania State University, The Type Roadside Designated April 30, 1947 [ 12 ] The Pennsylvania State University ( Penn State or PSU ) is a public state-related land-grant research university with campuses and facilities throughout Pennsylvania , United States. Founded in 1855 as Farmers' High School of Pennsylvania , [ 13 ] Penn State was named the state's first land-grant university eight years later, in 1863. Its primary campus, known as Penn State University Park , is located in State College and College Township .

Penn State enrolls more than 89,000 students, of which more than 74,000 are undergraduates and more than 14,000 are postgraduates. In addition to its land-grant designation, the university is a sea-grant , space-grant , and sun-grant university. It is classified among "R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity" and is a member of the Association of American Universities (AAU).

[ 14 ] [ 15 ] The university has two law schools : Penn State Law on the school's University Park campus and Penn State Dickinson Law in Carlisle . The College of Medicine is in Hershey . The university maintains 19 commonwealth campuses and five special mission campuses located across Pennsylvania.

[ 16 ] The university competes in the Big Ten Conference in Division I of the NCAA for most of its athletic teams, known collectively as the Penn State Nittany Lions . Since its founding, Penn State has won 82 national collegiate team championships, including 54 NCAA titles across all sports, and Penn State students, alumni, faculty, and coaches have won a total of 74 Olympic medals , including 20 gold medals.

History [ edit ] Main article: History of Pennsylvania State University 19th century [ edit ] Old Main at Penn State in 1855 The university's Electrical Engineering and Chemistry Building, c.

1894 Pennsylvania State University was founded in 1855 when James Irvin , a U.S. Congressman from Bellefonte , donated 200 acres (0.8 km 2 ) of land in Centre County [ 17 ] to the newly-established Farmers High School of Pennsylvania , representing the first of 10,101 acres (41 km 2 ) the school eventually acquired.

The same year, on February 22, the Pennsylvania General Assembly designated the school a degree-granting institution.

[ 18 ] [ 17 ] Initially sponsored by the Pennsylvania State Agricultural Society, the use of "college" or "university" was avoided in the school's naming since local Pennsylvanians perceived that such institutions were impractical in their curricula.

In 1862, the school's name was changed to the Agricultural College of Pennsylvania . The following year, in 1863, the Morrill Land-Grant Acts was passed by the U.S. Congress , and Pennsylvania selected the school to be the state's sole land-grant college.

[ 17 ] Two years later, in 1874, the school's name was changed to the Pennsylvania State College .

[ 17 ] By 1875, enrollment fell to 64 undergraduates, and the school attempted to balance its primary focus on agricultural studies with classic education .

[ 19 ] In 1882, George W. Atherton was named the school's president; Atherton set about broadening the curriculum beyond its agricultural focus.

The school developed an engineering studies program that immediately became one of the nation's ten largest engineering schools .

[ 20 ] [ 21 ] A major road in State College was later named in Atherton's honor. Penn State's Atherton Hall, a well-furnished and centrally located residence hall, was named after George Atherton's wife, Frances Washburn Atherton.

[ 22 ] [ 23 ] 20th century [ edit ] In the 20th century, Penn State grew significantly, becoming the largest grantor of baccalaureate degrees in Pennsylvania . In 1936, its enrollment reached 5,000.

[ 19 ] Around this time, Ralph D. Hetzel , the school's president, established a commonwealth of colleges to provide an alternative for Depression -era students who were economically unable to leave home to attend college.

[ 19 ] In 1953, President Milton S. Eisenhower , the brother of then- U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower , sought and won permission to elevate the school to university status, and it assumed its current name, The Pennsylvania State University .

[ 24 ] Under Eisenhower's successor, Eric A. Walker , the university acquired hundreds of acres of surrounding land, and enrollment nearly tripled.

[ 19 ] In 1967, the Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center , a college of medicine and hospital, was established in Hershey with a $50 million gift from the Hershey Trust Company .

[ 19 ] In 1970s, the university became a state-related institution, leading to its membership in the Commonwealth System of Higher Education . In 1975, the lyrics in the Penn State Alma Mater were revised to be gender-neutral in honor of International Women's Year ; the revised lyrics were taken from the posthumously published autobiography of the writer of the original lyrics, Fred Lewis Pattee. Professor Patricia Farrell acted as a spokesperson for those who wanted the change.

[ 25 ] In 1989, the Pennsylvania College of Technology in Williamsport became affiliated with the university.

Students on the campus of present-day Penn State University Park , the university's main campus, c.

1922 21st century [ edit ] In 2000, Dickinson School of Law joined the Pennsylvania College of Technology in affiliating with the university.

[ 26 ] The university is now the largest in Pennsylvania, and in 2003, it was credited with having the second-largest impact on the state economy of any organization, generating an economic effect of over $17 billion on a budget of $2.5 billion.

[ 27 ] To offset the lack of funding due to the limited growth in state appropriations to Penn State, the university has concentrated its efforts on philanthropy (2003 marked the end of the Grand Destiny campaign—a seven-year effort that raised over $1.3 billion).

[ 28 ] Child sex abuse scandal [ edit ] Main article: Penn State child sex abuse scandal In 2011, the university and its football program garnered international media attention and criticism in a sex abuse scandal in which university officials were alleged to have covered up incidents of child sexual abuse by former football team defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky . Athletic director Timothy Curley and Gary Schultz, senior vice president for finance and business, were indicted for perjury. In the wake of the scandal, Coach Joe Paterno was fired [ 29 ] and school president Graham B. Spanier was forced to resign [ 30 ] by the board of trustees . Sandusky, who maintained his innocence, [ 31 ] was indicted and subsequently convicted in June 2012 on 45 counts for the abuse.

A subcommittee of the board of trustees engaged former FBI director Louis Freeh to head an independent investigation on the university's handling of the incidents. Freeh released his findings in July 2012, concluding that Paterno, Spanier, Curley, and Schultz "conceal[ed] Sandusky's activities from the board of trustees, the university community and authorities" and "failed to protect against a child sexual predator harming children for over a decade".

[ 32 ] [ 33 ] On July 23, 2012, the National Collegiate Athletic Association levied sanctions against Penn State for its role in the scandal, penalizing the Penn State football program with a $60 million fine, a ban from bowl games and post-season play for four years, reducing its scholarships from 25 to 15 annually for four years, vacating of all Penn State football wins from 1998 to 2011, and placing the program on a five-year probationary period.

[ 34 ] Following imposition of the NCAA sanctions, emails surfaced indicating that high-level NCAA officials did not believe they had the jurisdiction to pass down the original sanctions.

[ 35 ] Subsequent emails, brought forward under subpoena, quoted an NCAA vice president, who wrote, "I characterized our approach to PSU as a bluff when talking to Mark [Emmert, NCAA president]...He basically agreed [because] I think he understands that if we made this an enforcement issue, we may win the immediate battle but lose the war." [ 36 ] On September 8, 2014, following a report by former U.S. senator and athletics integrity monitor George J. Mitchell citing progress by Penn State in implementing reforms, the NCAA repealed the sanctions.

[ 37 ] [ 38 ] On January 16, 2015, all previous Penn State football records were restored.

[ 39 ] An investigation led by former U.S. attorney general Richard Thornburgh , who the Paterno family retained to review the Freeh report, [ 40 ] concluded that the report that placed so much blame on Penn State and Paterno was a "rush to injustice" that could not be relied upon.

[ 41 ] He found that not only did the evidence "fall far short" of showing Paterno attempted to conceal the Sandusky scandal, but rather that "the contrary is true".

[ 40 ] In November 2014, Pennsylvania state senator Jake Corman released further emails that showed "regular and substantive" contact between NCAA officials and Freeh's investigators, suggesting that Freeh's conclusions were orchestrated.

[ 42 ] Death of Timothy Piazza [ edit ] Main article: Death of Tim Piazza On February 2, 2017, Timothy Piazza, a pledge of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity located off-campus in State College , died while undergoing hazing activities at the fraternity. Eighteen members of Penn State's Beta Theta Pi fraternity were initially charged in connection with Piazza's death, and the fraternity was closed and banned indefinitely. In July 2024, the fraternity president and vice president & pledge master each pleaded guilty to 14 misdemeanor counts of hazing and a misdemeanor count of recklessly endangering another person.

[ 43 ] Campuses [ edit ] University Park [ edit ] Main article: Penn State University Park A panoramic view of the Ag Hill Complex at the university in September 2012 Nittany Lion Shrine on the university's main campus in March 2014 The largest of the university's 24 campuses, Penn State University Park is located in State College and College Township in Centre County , in central Pennsylvania . Its dedicated ZIP Code is 16802. With an undergraduate acceptance rate of 49 percent, [ 44 ] it is the most selective campus in the Penn State system.

[ 45 ] The university ranks among the most selective schools in Pennsylvania , according to various publications.

[ 46 ] [ 47 ] [ 48 ] During the fall 2018 semester, 40,363 undergraduate students and 5,907 graduate students were enrolled at University Park.

[ 49 ] Of those, 46.5 percent were female [ 50 ] and 42.4 percent were non-Pennsylvania residents.

[ 51 ] The University Park campus is centrally located at the junction of Interstate 99 / U.S. Route 220 and U.S. Route 322 , and is due south of Interstate 80 . Before the arrival of the Interstates, University Park was a short distance from the Lock Haven – Altoona branch line of the Pennsylvania Railroad . The last run of long-distance trains from Buffalo or Harrisburg through Lock Haven was in 1971.

[ 52 ] Today, the nearest Amtrak passenger rail access is in Tyrone , 25 miles to the southwest. Intercity bus service to University Park is provided by Fullington Trailways , Greyhound Lines , Megabus , and OurBus . The State College Regional Airport , serving two regional airlines , is near University Park.

Commonwealth campuses [ edit ] Main article: Pennsylvania State University Commonwealth campuses Behrend Abington Altoona Beaver Berks Brandywine DuBois Fayette Allegheny Harrisburg Hazleton Lehigh Valley Mont Alto New Kensington Schuylkill Scranton Shenango Wilkes-Barre York Great Valley University Park class=notpageimage| A map depicting the locations of Penn State's 19 commonwealth campuses and the main Penn State University Park campus In addition to the University Park campus, 19 campus locations throughout the commonwealth of Pennsylvania offer enrollment for undergraduate students. Over 60 percent of Penn State first-year students begin their education at a location other than University Park.

[ 53 ] Each of the 19 commonwealth campuses offer a unique set of degree programs based on the student demographics. Any student in good academic standing is guaranteed a spot at University Park to finish his or her degree if required or desired, known as "change of campus" or, more accurately, "the 2+2 program"; where a Penn State student may start at any Penn State campus, including University Park, for two years and finish at any Penn State the final two years.

[ 54 ] Special mission campuses and World Campus [ edit ] Special mission campuses [ edit ] Further information: Pennsylvania College of Technology , Penn State Dickinson Law , Penn State Great Valley School of Graduate Professional Studies , Penn State Law , and Penn State University College of Medicine Penn State Dickinson Law in Carlisle in October 2013 The Main Building at Penn State Great Valley School of Graduate Professional Studies in Malvern , in September 2018 Dickinson Law , founded in 1834 as The Dickinson School of Law in Carlisle , is the oldest law school in Pennsylvania [ 55 ] and the fifth-oldest in the country. Since its founding, its graduates have included several notable attorneys, judges, government and corporate leaders, and legal educators. Dickinson School of Law's 1997 merger with Penn State was completed in 2000. It expanded its reputation, network, and joint degree programs complementing Dickinson Law's legacy as an innovative leader in experiential education.

[ 56 ] In 2006, a second law campus was opened at University Park. In 2014, the law school was split into two separately accredited law schools: Dickinson Law in Carlisle and Penn State Law in University Park.

[ 57 ] The last students to attend the dual-campus Penn State Dickinson School of Law graduated in May 2017.

[ 58 ] Penn State Great Valley School of Graduate Professional Studies in Malvern , is a special mission campus offering master's degrees, graduate certification, and continuing professional education. It also offers classes at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard .

Penn State University College of Medicine in Hershey , is the university's medical school and teaching hospital.

Pennsylvania College of Technology , in Williamsport , which became an affiliate of the university in 1989, offers degrees and certificates in over ten technical fields.

World Campus [ edit ] Main article: Penn State World Campus In 1998, the university launched Penn State World Campus , or Penn State Online, which offers more than 60 online education programs, degrees, and certificates. Distance education has a long history at Penn State, one of the first universities in the country to offer a correspondence course for remote farmers in 1892. Examples of online programs include an MBA , a master of professional studies in homeland security, a Bachelor of Science in nursing, and post-baccalaureate certificates in geographic information systems and applied behavior analysis.

[ 59 ] Organization and administration [ edit ] Penn State is a state-related university and a member of Pennsylvania's Commonwealth System of Higher Education . While it receives funding from the Commonwealth and is connected to the state through its board of trustees, however, it is otherwise independent and not subject to any direct control by the state. For the 2006–2007 fiscal year, the university received 9.7 percent of its budget from state appropriations, the lowest of the four state-related institutions in Pennsylvania.

[ 60 ] Colleges [ edit ] Schreyer Honors College in May 2014 The Carnegie Building in February 2008 Huck Institute of the Life Sciences: Gateway to the Sciences in July 2017 Penn State has eighteen colleges, including three at special-mission campuses.

It is the largest component of Penn State's research efforts statewide, with over 1,000 researchers and other staff members.

[ 103 ] [ 104 ] The Materials Research Institute (MRI) was created to coordinate the highly diverse and growing materials activities across Penn State's University Park campus. With more than 200 faculty in 15 departments,four colleges, and two Department of Defense research laboratories, MRI was designed to break down the academic walls that traditionally divide disciplines and enable faculty to collaborate across departmental and even college boundaries. MRI has become a model for this interdisciplinary approach to research, both within and outside the university. Dr. Richard E. Tressler was an international leader in the development of high-temperature materials. He pioneered high-temperature fiber testing and use, advanced instrumentation and test methodologies for thermostructural materials, and design and performance verification of ceramics and composites in high-temperature aerospace, industrial, and energy applications. He was founding director of the Center for Advanced Materials (CAM), which supported many faculty and students from the college of earth and mineral science, the Eberly College of Science, the college of engineering, the materials research laboratory and the applied research laboratories at Penn State on high-temperature materials. His vision for interdisciplinary research played a key role in creating the Materials Research Institute, and the establishment of Penn State as an acknowledged leader among major universities in materials education and research.

[ 105 ] [ 106 ] [ 107 ] The university was one of the founding members of the Worldwide Universities Network (WUN), a partnership that includes 17 research-led universities in the United States, Asia, and Europe. The network provides funding, facilitates collaboration between universities, and coordinates exchanges of faculty members and graduate students among institutions. Former Penn State president Graham Spanier is a former vice-chair of the WUN.

[ 108 ] [ 109 ] Pennsylvania State University Libraries were ranked 14th among research libraries in North America in the 2003–2004 survey released by The Chronicle of Higher Education .

[ 110 ] The university's library system began with a 1,500-book two-room library in Old Main , [ 111 ] but moved to its own space – Carnegie Library (named after college trustee Andrew Carnegie ) – ten years later.

[ 112 ] In 2009, its holdings had grown to 5.2 million volumes, in addition to 500,000 maps, five million microforms, and 180,000 films and videos.

[ 113 ] The university is a member of the Center for Research Libraries .

The university's College of Information Sciences and Technology is the home of CiteSeerX , an open-access repository and search engine for scholarly publications. The university is also the host to the Radiation Science & Engineering Center , which houses the oldest operating university research reactor . Additionally, University Park houses the Graduate Program in Acoustics, [ 114 ] the only freestanding acoustics program in the United States. The university also houses the Center for Medieval Studies, a program that was founded to research and study the European Middle Ages , [ 115 ] and the Center for the Study of Higher Education (CSHE), one of the first centers established to research postsecondary education. It is a member of the CDIO Initiative , an international network of universities working to develop unique teaching methods in engineering. The university is also a member of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research , an organization of hundreds of leading universities dedicated to researching atmosphere and climatology.

Student life [ edit ] Student demographics [ edit ] Undergraduate demographics as of Fall 2023 [ 7 ] Race and ethnicity Total White 60% International student 11% Hispanic/Latino 10% Asian 8% Black/African American 6% Two or more races 4% Unknown 3% As of fall 2010, the racial makeup of the Penn State system including all campuses and special-mission colleges, was 75.4 percent white, 5.5 percent black, 4.3 percent Asian, 4.4 percent Hispanic, 0.2 percent Native American, 0.1 percent Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, 1.7 percent two or more races, 5.8 percent international students and 3.1 percent of an unknown race.

[ 117 ] Penn State has been the subject of controversy for several issues of discrimination. Following some violent attacks on African-Americans in downtown State College in 1988 and complaints that Penn State was not adequately recruiting African-American faculty and students to representative population levels, student activists occupied Old Main . They demanded that Penn State do more to recruit minority students and address intolerance toward minority students on campus and the local community.  After President Bryce Jordan canceled a promised meeting with students and organizations in the Paul Robeson Cultural Center on April 8, 1988, 250 students and activists nonviolently occupied Penn State's Telecommunications building on campus. The following morning, 50 state troopers and 45 local and campus police, equipped with helmets, batons, and rubber gloves, entered the building as the crowd outside sang " We Shall Overcome ", arresting 89 individuals for trespassing.

[ 118 ] All charges were later dismissed.

In 1990, a vice provost for educational equity was appointed to lead a five-year strategic plan to "create an environment characterized by equal access and respected participation for all groups and individuals irrespective of cultural differences." [ 119 ] [ 120 ] Since then, discrimination issues include the handling of death threats in 1992 and 2001, [ 121 ] [ 122 ] [ 123 ] [ 124 ] controversy around LGBT issues, [ 125 ] and the investigation of a 2006 sexual discrimination lawsuit filed by former Lady Lions basketball player Jennifer Harris , alleging that head coach Rene Portland dismissed her from the team in part due to her perceived sexual orientation.

[ 126 ] [ 127 ] Housing [ edit ] Irvin Residence Hall in West Halls in October 2006 Brill Hall in July 2017 There are seven housing complexes on campus for students attending the University Park campus: East Halls, North Halls, Pollock Halls, South Halls, West Halls, Eastview Terrace, and Nittany Apartments. Each complex consists of a few separate buildings that are dormitories and a commons building, which has: lounges, the help desk for the complex, mailboxes for each dormitory room, a convenience store, a food court, an all-you-care-to-eat buffet. Different floors within a building may be designated as a Living Learning Community (LLC). LLCs are offered to members of certain student groups, such as sororities, students studying particular majors, students who wish to engage in a particular lifestyle (such as the alcohol-free LIFE House), or other groups who wish to pursue similar goals.

Student organizations [ edit ] As of September 2014 [update] , 864 student organizations were recognized at the University Park campus.

[ 128 ] In addition, the university has one of the largest Greek systems in the country, with approximately 12 percent of the University Park population affiliated.

[ 130 ] THON [ edit ] The Penn State IFC/Panhellenic Dance Marathon in February 2007 Annually in February, thousands of students participate in the Penn State IFC/Panhellenic Dance Marathon (THON). Started in 1973 with 78 participants, THON has grown to become the largest student-run philanthropy in the world.

[ 131 ] Every year, participants stand for 46 hours nonstop and perform a line dance at least once every hour to stay alert alongside other events hosted throughout the weekend such as concerts, games, athlete hour, family hour, and a tribute to all of the children with cancer. In 2007, THON was moved to the Bryce Jordan Center and shortened from 48 to 46 hours, due to potential conflicts with basketball games.

[ 132 ] THON raises millions of dollars annually for childhood cancer care and research for its sole beneficiary, Four Diamonds. In 2025, THON raised a program record of $17.7 million.

[ 133 ] The Lion's Pantry [ edit ] The Lion's Pantry is an undergraduate student-run on-campus food pantry and registered student organization. The Lion's Pantry serves undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. With increasing awareness of hunger on college campuses, the Lion's Pantry is one of the nation's most successful startup food pantries. They partner with groups ranging from Boulevard, UPUA, Greek Life, and more to receive over 8,000 food donations a year. The club was also awarded the Class Gift of 2017 in the form of an endowment.

[ 134 ] Public safety [ edit ] Twenty-two of Penn State's campuses are served by Penn State University Police and Public Safety. In addition to being a full-service police department, the department also has specialized units such as K9, criminal investigation, bike patrol, a bomb squad, and drones. The police department was founded in 1926 as Campus Patrol.

Penn State University Park is also served by the Penn State University Ambulance Service, known as Centre County Company 20. Penn State EMS is a full-service, licensed ambulance service, staffed by student EMTs. The ambulance is staffed around the clock, with the exception of the school's annual winter break, when it goes out of service. The ambulance is affiliated with the University Health Service.
