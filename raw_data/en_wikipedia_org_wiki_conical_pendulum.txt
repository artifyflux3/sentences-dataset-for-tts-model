Its construction is similar to an ordinary pendulum ; however, instead of swinging back and forth along a circular arc, the bob of a conical pendulum moves at a constant speed in a circle or ellipse with the string (or rod) tracing out a cone .  The conical pendulum was first studied by the English scientist Robert Hooke around 1660 [ 1 ] as a model for the orbital motion of planets .

[ 2 ] In 1673 Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens calculated its period, using his new concept of centrifugal force in his book Horologium Oscillatorium . Later it was used as the timekeeping element in a few mechanical clocks and other clockwork timing devices.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] Uses [ edit ] During the 1800s, conical pendulums were used as the timekeeping element in a few clockwork timing mechanisms where a smooth motion was required, as opposed to the unavoidably jerky motion provided by ordinary pendulums.

[ 4 ] Two examples were mechanisms to turn the lenses of lighthouses to sweep their beams across the sea, and the location drives of equatorial mount telescopes , to allow the telescope to follow a star smoothly across the sky as the Earth turns.

[ 3 ] One of the most important uses of the conical pendulum was in the flyball governor ( centrifugal governor ) invented by James Watt in 1788 which regulated the speed of steam engines during the Steam Age in the 1800s.

Some playground games, including totem tennis and tetherball , use a ball attached to a pole by a cord which functions as a conical pendulum, although in tetherball the pendulum gets shorter as the cord wraps around the pole.  Some amusement park rides also act as conical pendulums.

Analysis [ edit ] Consider a conical pendulum consisting of a bob of mass m revolving without friction in a circle at a constant speed v on a string of length L at an angle of θ from the vertical.

There are two forces acting on the bob: the tension T in the string, which is exerted along the line of the string and acts toward the point of suspension.

the downward bob weight mg , where m is the mass of the bob and g is the local gravitational acceleration .

The force exerted by the string can be resolved into a horizontal component, T sin( θ ), toward the center of the circle, and a vertical component, T cos( θ ), in the upward direction.  From Newton's second law , the horizontal component of the tension in the string gives the bob a centripetal acceleration toward the center of the circle: T sin ⁡ ⁡ θ θ = m v 2 r {\displaystyle T\sin \theta ={\frac {mv^{2}}{r}}\,} Conical pendulum whose bob travels in a horizontal circle of radius r .  The bob has mass m and is suspended by a string of length L .  The tension force of the string acting on the bob is the vector T , and the bob's weight is the vector mg .

Since there is no acceleration in the vertical direction, the vertical component of the tension in the string is equal and opposite to the weight of the bob: T cos ⁡ ⁡ θ θ = m g {\displaystyle T\cos \theta =mg\,} These two equations can be solved for T / m and equated, thereby eliminating T and m and yielding the centripetal acceleration: g tan ⁡ ⁡ θ θ = v 2 r {\displaystyle {g\tan \theta }={\frac {v^{2}}{r}}} A little rearrangement gives: g cos ⁡ ⁡ θ θ = v 2 r sin ⁡ ⁡ θ θ {\displaystyle {\frac {g}{\cos \theta }}={\frac {v^{2}}{r\sin \theta }}} Since the speed of the pendulum bob is constant, it can be expressed as the circumference 2 πr divided by the time t required for one revolution of the bob: v = 2 π π r t {\displaystyle v={\frac {2\pi r}{t}}} Substituting the right side of this equation for v in the previous equation, we find: g cos ⁡ ⁡ θ θ = ( 2 π π r t ) 2 r sin ⁡ ⁡ θ θ = ( 2 π π ) 2 r t 2 sin ⁡ ⁡ θ θ {\displaystyle {\frac {g}{\cos \theta }}={\frac {({\frac {2\pi r}{t}})^{2}}{r\sin \theta }}={\frac {(2\pi )^{2}r}{t^{2}\sin \theta }}} Using the trigonometric identity tan( θ ) = sin( θ ) / cos( θ ) and solving for t , the time required for the bob to travel one revolution is t = 2 π π r g tan ⁡ ⁡ θ θ {\displaystyle t=2\pi {\sqrt {\frac {r}{g\tan \theta }}}} In a practical experiment, r varies and is not as easy to measure as the constant string length L .

r can be eliminated from the equation by noting that r , h , and L form a right triangle, with θ being the angle between the leg h and the hypotenuse L (see diagram).  Therefore, r = L sin ⁡ ⁡ θ θ {\displaystyle r=L\sin \theta \,} Substituting this value for r yields a formula whose only varying parameter is the suspension angle θ : [ 5 ] t = 2 π π L cos ⁡ ⁡ θ θ g {\displaystyle \,t=2\pi {\sqrt {\frac {L\cos \theta }{g}}}\,} For small angles θ , cos( θ ) ≈ 1; in which case t ≈ ≈ 2 π π L g {\displaystyle t\approx 2\pi {\sqrt {\frac {L}{g}}}} so that for small angles the period t of a conical pendulum is equal to the period of an ordinary pendulum of the same length.  Also, the period for small angles is approximately independent of changes in the angle θ .  This means the period of rotation is approximately independent of the force applied to keep it rotating.  This property, called isochronism , is shared with ordinary pendulums and makes both types of pendulums useful for timekeeping.
