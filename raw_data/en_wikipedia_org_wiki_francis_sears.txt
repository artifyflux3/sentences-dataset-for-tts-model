He was a professor of physics at MIT for 35 years before moving to Dartmouth College in 1956.

[ 1 ] At Dartmouth, Sears was the Appleton Professor of Physics.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] He is best known for co-authoring University Physics , an introductory physics textbook, with Mark Zemansky . The book, first published in 1949, is often referred to as " Sears and Zemansky ", although Hugh Young became a coauthor in 1973.

In 1932 he collaborated with Peter Debye in the discovery of what is now called the Debye–Sears effect , the diffraction of light by ultrasonic waves.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] Sears was a fellow of the Optical Society of America , and was active in the American Association of Physics Teachers , serving as its treasurer from 1950 to 1958, followed by successive one-year terms as president-elect and president.

[ 6 ] He retired to Norwich, Vermont and died in Hanover, New Hampshire , of a stroke on November 12, 1975.
