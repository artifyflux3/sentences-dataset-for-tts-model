In other words, the Jacobi fields along a geodesic form the tangent space to the geodesic in the space of all geodesics. They are named after Carl Jacobi .

Definitions and properties [ edit ] Jacobi fields can be obtained in the following way: Take a smooth one parameter family of geodesics γ γ τ τ {\displaystyle \gamma _{\tau }} with γ γ 0 = γ γ {\displaystyle \gamma _{0}=\gamma } , then J ( t ) = ∂ ∂ γ γ τ τ ( t ) ∂ ∂ τ τ | τ τ = 0 {\displaystyle J(t)=\left.{\frac {\partial \gamma _{\tau }(t)}{\partial \tau }}\right|_{\tau =0}} is a Jacobi field, and describes the behavior of the geodesics in an infinitesimal neighborhood of a 
given geodesic γ γ {\displaystyle \gamma } .

A vector field J along a geodesic γ γ {\displaystyle \gamma } is said to be a Jacobi field if it satisfies the Jacobi equation : D 2 d t 2 J ( t ) + R ( J ( t ) , γ γ ˙ ˙ ( t ) ) γ γ ˙ ˙ ( t ) = 0 , {\displaystyle {\frac {D^{2}}{dt^{2}}}J(t)+R(J(t),{\dot {\gamma }}(t)){\dot {\gamma }}(t)=0,} where D denotes the covariant derivative with respect to the Levi-Civita connection , R the Riemann curvature tensor , γ γ ˙ ˙ ( t ) = d γ γ ( t ) / d t {\displaystyle {\dot {\gamma }}(t)=d\gamma (t)/dt} the tangent vector field, and t is the parameter of the geodesic.
On a complete Riemannian manifold, for any Jacobi field there is a family of geodesics γ γ τ τ {\displaystyle \gamma _{\tau }} describing the field (as in the preceding paragraph).

The Jacobi equation is a linear , second order ordinary differential equation ;
in particular, values of J {\displaystyle J} and D d t J {\displaystyle {\frac {D}{dt}}J} at one point of γ γ {\displaystyle \gamma } uniquely determine the Jacobi field. Furthermore, the set of Jacobi fields along a given geodesic forms a real vector space of dimension twice the dimension of the manifold.

As trivial examples of Jacobi fields one can consider γ γ ˙ ˙ ( t ) {\displaystyle {\dot {\gamma }}(t)} and t γ γ ˙ ˙ ( t ) {\displaystyle t{\dot {\gamma }}(t)} . These correspond respectively to the following families of reparametrizations: γ γ τ τ ( t ) = γ γ ( τ τ + t ) {\displaystyle \gamma _{\tau }(t)=\gamma (\tau +t)} and γ γ τ τ ( t ) = γ γ ( ( 1 + τ τ ) t ) {\displaystyle \gamma _{\tau }(t)=\gamma ((1+\tau )t)} .

Any Jacobi field J {\displaystyle J} can be represented in a unique way as a sum T + I {\displaystyle T+I} , where T = a γ γ ˙ ˙ ( t ) + b t γ γ ˙ ˙ ( t ) {\displaystyle T=a{\dot {\gamma }}(t)+bt{\dot {\gamma }}(t)} is a linear combination of trivial Jacobi fields and I ( t ) {\displaystyle I(t)} is orthogonal to γ γ ˙ ˙ ( t ) {\displaystyle {\dot {\gamma }}(t)} , for all t {\displaystyle t} . 
The field I {\displaystyle I} then corresponds to the same variation of geodesics as J {\displaystyle J} , only with changed parametrizations.

Motivating example [ edit ] On a unit sphere , the geodesics through the North pole are great circles . Consider two such geodesics γ γ 0 {\displaystyle \gamma _{0}} and γ γ τ τ {\displaystyle \gamma _{\tau }} with natural parameter, t ∈ ∈ [ 0 , π π ] {\displaystyle t\in [0,\pi ]} , separated by an angle τ τ {\displaystyle \tau } . The geodesic distance d ( γ γ 0 ( t ) , γ γ τ τ ( t ) ) {\displaystyle d(\gamma _{0}(t),\gamma _{\tau }(t))\,} is d ( γ γ 0 ( t ) , γ γ τ τ ( t ) ) = sin − − 1 ⁡ ⁡ ( sin ⁡ ⁡ t sin ⁡ ⁡ τ τ 1 + cos 2 ⁡ ⁡ t tan 2 ⁡ ⁡ ( τ τ / 2 ) ) .

{\displaystyle d(\gamma _{0}(t),\gamma _{\tau }(t))=\sin ^{-1}{\bigg (}\sin t\sin \tau {\sqrt {1+\cos ^{2}t\tan ^{2}(\tau /2)}}{\bigg )}.} Computing this requires knowing the geodesics. The most interesting information is just that d ( γ γ 0 ( π π ) , γ γ τ τ ( π π ) ) = 0 {\displaystyle d(\gamma _{0}(\pi ),\gamma _{\tau }(\pi ))=0\,} , for any τ τ {\displaystyle \tau } .

Instead, we can consider the derivative with respect to τ τ {\displaystyle \tau } at τ τ = 0 {\displaystyle \tau =0} : ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ τ τ | τ τ = 0 d ( γ γ 0 ( t ) , γ γ τ τ ( t ) ) = | J ( t ) | = sin ⁡ ⁡ t .

{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial }{\partial \tau }}{\bigg |}_{\tau =0}d(\gamma _{0}(t),\gamma _{\tau }(t))=|J(t)|=\sin t.} Notice that we still detect the intersection of the geodesics at t = π π {\displaystyle t=\pi } . Notice further that to calculate this derivative we do not actually need to know d ( γ γ 0 ( t ) , γ γ τ τ ( t ) ) {\displaystyle d(\gamma _{0}(t),\gamma _{\tau }(t))\,} , rather, all we need do is solve the equation y ″ + y = 0 {\displaystyle y''+y=0\,} , for some given initial data.

Jacobi fields give a natural generalization of this phenomenon to arbitrary Riemannian manifolds .

Solving the Jacobi equation [ edit ] Let e 1 ( 0 ) = γ γ ˙ ˙ ( 0 ) / | γ γ ˙ ˙ ( 0 ) | {\displaystyle e_{1}(0)={\dot {\gamma }}(0)/|{\dot {\gamma }}(0)|} and complete this to get an orthonormal basis { e i ( 0 ) } {\displaystyle {\big \{}e_{i}(0){\big \}}} at T γ γ ( 0 ) M {\displaystyle T_{\gamma (0)}M} .

Parallel transport it to get a basis { e i ( t ) } {\displaystyle \{e_{i}(t)\}} all along γ γ {\displaystyle \gamma } . 
This gives an orthonormal basis with e 1 ( t ) = γ γ ˙ ˙ ( t ) / | γ γ ˙ ˙ ( t ) | {\displaystyle e_{1}(t)={\dot {\gamma }}(t)/|{\dot {\gamma }}(t)|} . The Jacobi field can be written in co-ordinates in terms of this basis as J ( t ) = y k ( t ) e k ( t ) {\displaystyle J(t)=y^{k}(t)e_{k}(t)} and thus D d t J = ∑ ∑ k d y k d t e k ( t ) , D 2 d t 2 J = ∑ ∑ k d 2 y k d t 2 e k ( t ) , {\displaystyle {\frac {D}{dt}}J=\sum _{k}{\frac {dy^{k}}{dt}}e_{k}(t),\quad {\frac {D^{2}}{dt^{2}}}J=\sum _{k}{\frac {d^{2}y^{k}}{dt^{2}}}e_{k}(t),} and the Jacobi equation can be rewritten as a system d 2 y k d t 2 + | γ γ ˙ ˙ | 2 ∑ ∑ j y j ( t ) ⟨ ⟨ R ( e j ( t ) , e 1 ( t ) ) e 1 ( t ) , e k ( t ) ⟩ ⟩ = 0 {\displaystyle {\frac {d^{2}y^{k}}{dt^{2}}}+|{\dot {\gamma }}|^{2}\sum _{j}y^{j}(t)\langle R(e_{j}(t),e_{1}(t))e_{1}(t),e_{k}(t)\rangle =0} for each k {\displaystyle k} . This way we get a linear ordinary differential equation (ODE). 
Since this ODE has smooth coefficients we have that solutions exist for all t {\displaystyle t} and are unique, given y k ( 0 ) {\displaystyle y^{k}(0)} and y k ′ ( 0 ) {\displaystyle {y^{k}}'(0)} , for all k {\displaystyle k} .

Examples [ edit ] Consider a geodesic γ γ ( t ) {\displaystyle \gamma (t)} with parallel orthonormal frame e i ( t ) {\displaystyle e_{i}(t)} , e 1 ( t ) = γ γ ˙ ˙ ( t ) / | γ γ ˙ ˙ | {\displaystyle e_{1}(t)={\dot {\gamma }}(t)/|{\dot {\gamma }}|} , constructed as above.

The vector fields along γ γ {\displaystyle \gamma } given by γ γ ˙ ˙ ( t ) {\displaystyle {\dot {\gamma }}(t)} and t γ γ ˙ ˙ ( t ) {\displaystyle t{\dot {\gamma }}(t)} are Jacobi fields.

In Euclidean space (as well as for spaces of constant zero sectional curvature ) Jacobi fields are simply those fields linear in t {\displaystyle t} .

For Riemannian manifolds of constant negative sectional curvature − − k 2 {\displaystyle -k^{2}} , any Jacobi field is a linear combination of γ γ ˙ ˙ ( t ) {\displaystyle {\dot {\gamma }}(t)} , t γ γ ˙ ˙ ( t ) {\displaystyle t{\dot {\gamma }}(t)} and exp ⁡ ⁡ ( ± ± k t ) e i ( t ) {\displaystyle \exp(\pm kt)e_{i}(t)} , where i > 1 {\displaystyle i>1} .

For Riemannian manifolds of constant positive sectional curvature k 2 {\displaystyle k^{2}} , any Jacobi field is a linear combination of γ γ ˙ ˙ ( t ) {\displaystyle {\dot {\gamma }}(t)} , t γ γ ˙ ˙ ( t ) {\displaystyle t{\dot {\gamma }}(t)} , sin ⁡ ⁡ ( k t ) e i ( t ) {\displaystyle \sin(kt)e_{i}(t)} and cos ⁡ ⁡ ( k t ) e i ( t ) {\displaystyle \cos(kt)e_{i}(t)} , where i > 1 {\displaystyle i>1} .

The restriction of a Killing vector field to a geodesic is a Jacobi field in any Riemannian manifold.
