[ 4 ] [ 5 ] Title [ edit ] Ayn-al-Qużat in Arabic means "the pearl of the judges": Ayn means the eye, implying something very valuable, and Qozat is the plural of Qadi , which means judge.

Life [ edit ] Ayn al-Quzat was born in Hamedan and his ancestors were of Hamedan judges . His full name is Abu’l-maʿālī ʿabdallāh Bin Abībakr Mohammad Mayānejī ( Persian : ابو المعالی عبدالله بن ابی‌ بکر محمد میانجی ). He was a disciple of Ahmad Ghazali and devoted of Hallaj . He became a famous scholar at early age, and by the time he was thirty he was chosen to be a judge. Along with Abu Hamed Al-Ghazali , he is one of the founders of doctrinal Sufism . According to some accounts, he was briefly a pupil of Omar Khayyam . Upon his return from pilgrimage, Khayyam likely stayed in Hamadan for some time. It is possible that during his stay he became tutor to the young Ain al-Quzat.

[ 6 ] : 351 However, Aminrazavi (2007) believes that from the figures who may have studied with Khayyam Ain al-Quzat is the least likely and that arguing their association is wishful thinking by those who like to view Khayyam as a Sufi.

[ 6 ] : 23 Unlike most of the Sufis who have lived as respected and revered members of their communities, he fell afoul of the Seljuk rulers and was accused of heresy and executed, either by crucifixion or burning.

[ 7 ] : 70 Ayn al-Quzat along with Mansur al-Hallaj and Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi are known as the three martyrs of Sufism.

[ according to whom?

] Work [ edit ] The most significant works of Ayn al-Qożāt are Tamhīdāt ( تمهیدات ; Preludes) and Zubdat al-ḥaqāʾiq fī kašf al-ḵalāʾeq ( زبدة الحقائق في کشف الخلائق ; The Essence of Truth) . Both books are masterpieces of Sufi literature and have mystical and philosophical significance.

[ 8 ] Ayn al-Qożāt Hamadānī quoted a few verses apparently in his own Iranian dialect (where it is called fahlavī; bayt-e pahlavī in a manuscript variant).

[ 9 ] Poetry [ edit ] A famous quatrain is said to be his: ما مرگ و شهادت از خدا خواسته ايم وآن هم به سه چيز کم بها خواسته ايم گر دوست چنين کند که ما خواسته ايم مـا آتـش و نفـت و بـوريا خــواسـته ايم I want death and martyrdom from God I want it in three low-priced things If the friend (i.e. God) grant my wishes I want fire and oil and straw This quatrain refers to his execution by Caliph's order.

Contemporary Persian and Classical Persian are the same language, but writers since 1900 are classified as contemporary. At one time, Persian was a common cultural language of much of the non-Arabic Islamic world.  Today it is the official language of Iran , Tajikistan and one of the two official languages of Afghanistan .
