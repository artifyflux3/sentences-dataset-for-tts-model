 You deserve an explanation 

August 17: An important update for readers in the United States. 

Please don't skip this 1-minute read. It's Sunday, August 17, and we're running a short fundraiser to support Wikipedia. If you've lost count of how many times you've visited Wikipedia this year, we hope that means it's given you at least $2.75 of knowledge. Please join the 2% of readers who give what they can to keep this valuable resource ad-free and available for all.

After nearly 25 years, Wikipedia is still the internet we were promised—created by people, not by machines. It's not perfect, but it's not here to push a point of view. It's owned by a non-profit, not a giant technology company or a billionaire.

Most readers donate because Wikipedia is useful to them, others because Wikipedia is more important than ever. If you feel the same, please donate $2.75 now—or consider a monthly gift to help all year. Thank you.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Type of physical quantity

In [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics") and [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), a **pseudotensor** is usually a quantity that transforms like a [tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor "Tensor") under an orientation-preserving [coordinate transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_transformation "Coordinate transformation") (e.g. a [proper rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_rotation "Proper rotation")) but additionally changes sign under an orientation-reversing coordinate transformation (e.g., an [improper rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improper_rotation "Improper rotation")), which is a transformation that can be expressed as a proper rotation followed by [reflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(mathematics) "Reflection (mathematics)"). This is a generalization of a _[pseudovector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudovector "Pseudovector")_. To evaluate a tensor or pseudotensor sign, it has to be [contracted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_contraction "Tensor contraction") with some vectors, as many as its [rank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_(intrinsic_definition)#Tensor_rank "Tensor (intrinsic definition)") is, belonging to the space where the rotation is made while keeping the tensor coordinates unaffected (differently from what one does in the case of a base change). Under improper rotation a pseudotensor and a proper tensor of the same rank will have different sign which depends on the rank being [even or odd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_(mathematics) "Parity (mathematics)"). Sometimes inversion of the axes is used as an example of an improper rotation to see the behaviour of a pseudotensor, but it works only if vector space dimensions is odd otherwise inversion is a proper rotation without an additional reflection.

There is a second meaning for **pseudotensor** (and likewise for _pseudovector_), restricted to [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity"). Tensors obey strict transformation laws, but pseudotensors in this sense are not so constrained. Consequently, the form of a pseudotensor will, in general, change as the [frame of reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_of_reference "Frame of reference") is altered. An equation containing pseudotensors, such as [stress–energy–momentum pseudotensors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress%E2%80%93energy%E2%80%93momentum_pseudotensor "Stress–energy–momentum pseudotensor"), which holds in one frame will not necessarily hold in a different frame. This makes pseudotensors of limited relevance because equations in which they appear are not [invariant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_and_contravariance_of_vectors "Covariance and contravariance of vectors") in form.

Mathematical developments in the 1980s have allowed pseudotensors to be understood as [sections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_(fiber_bundle) "Section (fiber bundle)") of [jet bundles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_bundle "Jet bundle").

Definition
----------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pseudotensor&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Definition")]

Two quite different mathematical objects are called a pseudotensor in different contexts.

The first context is essentially a tensor multiplied by an extra sign factor, such that the pseudotensor changes sign under reflections when a normal tensor does not. According to one definition, a pseudotensor **P** of the type (p,q){\displaystyle (p,q)}![Image 23: {\displaystyle (p,q)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9769c58523b9b639866a2d48e657d9c26911143a) is a geometric object whose components in an arbitrary basis are enumerated by (p+q){\displaystyle (p+q)}![Image 24: {\displaystyle (p+q)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ed9d3b43fb0e3ee4b9bc392664cf5bd18981d96e)indices and obey the transformation rule P^j 1…j p i 1…i q=(−1)A A i 1 k 1⋯A i q k q B l 1 j 1⋯B l p j p P l 1…l p k 1…k q{\displaystyle {\hat {P}}_{\,j_{1}\ldots j_{p}}^{i_{1}\ldots i_{q}}=(-1)^{A}A^{i_{1}}{}_{k_{1}}\cdots A^{i_{q}}{}_{k_{q}}B^{l_{1}}{}_{j_{1}}\cdots B^{l_{p}}{}_{j_{p}}P_{l_{1}\ldots l_{p}}^{k_{1}\ldots k_{q}}}![Image 25: {\displaystyle {\hat {P}}_{\,j_{1}\ldots j_{p}}^{i_{1}\ldots i_{q}}=(-1)^{A}A^{i_{1}}{}_{k_{1}}\cdots A^{i_{q}}{}_{k_{q}}B^{l_{1}}{}_{j_{1}}\cdots B^{l_{p}}{}_{j_{p}}P_{l_{1}\ldots l_{p}}^{k_{1}\ldots k_{q}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e87ffb31277166010c6f906bdb106d9454a06f9a) under a change of basis.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudotensor#cite_note-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudotensor#cite_note-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudotensor#cite_note-3)

Here P^j 1…j p i 1…i q,P l 1…l p k 1…k q{\displaystyle {\hat {P}}_{\,j_{1}\ldots j_{p}}^{i_{1}\ldots i_{q}},P_{l_{1}\ldots l_{p}}^{k_{1}\ldots k_{q}}}![Image 26: {\displaystyle {\hat {P}}_{\,j_{1}\ldots j_{p}}^{i_{1}\ldots i_{q}},P_{l_{1}\ldots l_{p}}^{k_{1}\ldots k_{q}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4f166030f505547a963a903dd87c172a3b550aeb) are the components of the pseudotensor in the new and old bases, respectively, A i q k q{\displaystyle A^{i_{q}}{}_{k_{q}}}![Image 27: {\displaystyle A^{i_{q}}{}_{k_{q}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6cd9607406242f35102f4a836ca0e61c7415729f) is the transition matrix for the [contravariant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_and_contravariance_of_vectors "Covariance and contravariance of vectors") indices, B l p j p{\displaystyle B^{l_{p}}{}_{j_{p}}}![Image 28: {\displaystyle B^{l_{p}}{}_{j_{p}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/522b252b5f318dc4104df198ba6bac1411d4ca1a) is the transition matrix for the [covariant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance "Covariance") indices, and (−1)A=s i g n(det(A i q k q))=±1.{\displaystyle (-1)^{A}=\mathrm {sign} \left(\det \left(A^{i_{q}}{}_{k_{q}}\right)\right)=\pm {1}.}![Image 29: {\displaystyle (-1)^{A}=\mathrm {sign} \left(\det \left(A^{i_{q}}{}_{k_{q}}\right)\right)=\pm {1}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7ae259947e01362dfcdd2024c5f4b804ad96d906) This transformation rule differs from the rule for an ordinary tensor only by the presence of the factor (−1)A.{\displaystyle (-1)^{A}.}![Image 30: {\displaystyle (-1)^{A}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5d7196cd13594e841aa92378ab243e070b348a16)

The second context where the word "pseudotensor" is used is [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity"). In that theory, one cannot describe the energy and momentum of the gravitational field by an energy–momentum tensor. Instead, one introduces objects that behave as tensors only with respect to restricted coordinate transformations. Strictly speaking, such objects are not tensors at all. A famous example of such a pseudotensor is the [Landau–Lifshitz pseudotensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landau%E2%80%93Lifshitz_pseudotensor "Landau–Lifshitz pseudotensor").

On [non-orientable manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientable_manifold "Orientable manifold"), one cannot define a [volume form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume_form "Volume form") globally due to the non-orientability, but one can define a [volume element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume_element "Volume element"), which is formally a [density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_on_a_manifold "Density on a manifold"), and may also be called a _pseudo-volume form_, due to the additional sign twist (tensoring with the sign bundle). The volume element is a pseudotensor density according to the first definition.

A [change of variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_by_substitution "Integration by substitution") in multi-dimensional integration may be achieved through the incorporation of a factor of the absolute value of the [determinant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant "Determinant") of the [Jacobian matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobian_matrix_and_determinant "Jacobian matrix and determinant"). The use of the absolute value introduces a sign change for improper coordinate transformations to compensate for the convention of keeping integration (volume) element positive; as such, an [integrand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrand "Integrand") is an example of a pseudotensor density according to the first definition.

The [Christoffel symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christoffel_symbols "Christoffel symbols") of an [affine connection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_connection "Affine connection") on a manifold can be thought of as the correction terms to the partial derivatives of a coordinate expression of a vector field with respect to the coordinates to render it the vector field's covariant derivative. While the affine connection itself doesn't depend on the choice of coordinates, its Christoffel symbols do, making them a pseudotensor quantity according to the second definition.
