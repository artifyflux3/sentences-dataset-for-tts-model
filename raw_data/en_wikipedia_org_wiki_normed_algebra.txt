Find sources: "Normed algebra" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( May 2024 ) In mathematics, a normed algebra A is an algebra over a field which has a sub-multiplicative norm : ∀ ∀ x , y ∈ ∈ A ‖ ‖ x y ‖ ‖ ≤ ≤ ‖ ‖ x ‖ ‖ ‖ ‖ y ‖ ‖ .

{\displaystyle \forall x,y\in A\qquad \|xy\|\leq \|x\|\|y\|.} Some authors require it to have a multiplicative identity 1 A such that ║1 A ║ = 1.
