In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics") and specifically in [algebraic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry "Algebraic geometry"), the **dimension** of an [algebraic variety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_variety "Algebraic variety") may be defined in various equivalent ways.

Some of these definitions are of geometric nature, while some other are purely algebraic and rely on [commutative algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_algebra "Commutative algebra"). Some are restricted to algebraic varieties while others apply also to any [algebraic set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_set "Algebraic set"). Some are intrinsic, as independent of any [embedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedding "Embedding") of the variety into an [affine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_space "Affine space") or [projective space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_space "Projective space"), while other are related to such an embedding.

Dimension of an affine algebraic set
------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dimension_of_an_algebraic_variety&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Dimension of an affine algebraic set")]

Let _K_ be a [field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics) "Field (mathematics)"), and _L_ ⊇ _K_ be an [algebraically closed extension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraically_closed_extension "Algebraically closed extension").

An [affine algebraic set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_algebraic_set "Affine algebraic set")_V_ is the set of the common [zeros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_of_a_function "Zero of a function") in _L_ _n_ of the elements of an [ideal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_of_a_ring "Ideal of a ring")_I_ in a [polynomial ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_ring "Polynomial ring")![Image 1: {\displaystyle R=K[x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n}].}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6c09cfbe2f8a7e95a74bba0e6d059748bf776feb) Let ![Image 2: {\displaystyle A=R/I}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/45aaf590840d376315df53d1d4ce77b04f3d6e0b) be the [_K_-algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra_over_a_field "Algebra over a field") of the polynomial functions over _V_. The dimension of _V_ is any of the following integers. It does not change if _K_ is enlarged, if _L_ is replaced by another algebraically closed extension of _K_ and if _I_ is replaced by another ideal having the same zeros (that is having the same [radical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_of_an_ideal "Radical of an ideal")). The dimension is also independent of the choice of coordinates; in other words it does not change if the _x_ _i_ are replaced by [linearly independent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linearly_independent "Linearly independent")[linear combinations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_combination "Linear combination") of them.

The dimension of _V_ is

This definition generalizes a property of the dimension of a [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space") or a [vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space"). It is thus probably the definition that gives the easiest intuitive description of the notion.

*   _The [Krull dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krull\_dimension "Krull dimension") of the [coordinate ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate\_ring "Coordinate ring")A._

This is the transcription of the preceding definition in the language of [commutative algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_algebra "Commutative algebra"), the Krull dimension being the maximal length of the chains ![Image 3: {\displaystyle p_{0}\subset p_{1}\subset \ldots \subset p_{d}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a416084eb7f8ee389e54548a301ff4d65db4a0ea) of [prime ideals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_ideal "Prime ideal") of _A_.

*   _The maximal Krull dimension of the [local rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local\_ring "Local ring") at the points of V_.

This definition shows that the dimension is a _local property if ![Image 4: {\displaystyle V}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest\_v1/media/math/render/svg/af0f6064540e84211d0ffe4dac72098adfa52845) is irreducible._ If ![Image 5: {\displaystyle V}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/af0f6064540e84211d0ffe4dac72098adfa52845) is irreducible, it turns out that all the local rings at points of V have the same Krull dimension (see [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension_of_an_algebraic_variety#cite_note-1)); thus:

*   _If V is a variety, the Krull dimension of the local ring at any point of V_

This rephrases the previous definition into a more geometric language.

*   _The maximal dimension of the [tangent vector spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent\_space "Tangent space") at the non [singular points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular\_point\_of\_an\_algebraic\_variety "Singular point of an algebraic variety") of V_.

This relates the dimension of a variety to that of a [differentiable manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_manifold "Differentiable manifold"). More precisely, if _V_ if defined over the reals, then the set of its real regular points, if it is not empty, is a differentiable manifold that has the same dimension as a variety and as a manifold.

*   _If V is a variety, the dimension of the [tangent vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent\_space "Tangent space") at any non [singular point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular\_point\_of\_an\_algebraic\_variety "Singular point of an algebraic variety") of V_.

This is the algebraic analogue to the fact that a connected [manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold "Manifold") has a constant dimension. This can also be deduced from the result stated below the third definition, and the fact that the dimension of the tangent space is equal to the Krull dimension at any non-singular point (see [Zariski tangent space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zariski_tangent_space "Zariski tangent space")).

*   _The number of [hyperplanes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplane "Hyperplane") or [hypersurfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersurface "Hypersurface") in [general position](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General\_position "General position") which are needed to have an intersection with V which is reduced to a nonzero finite number of points._

This definition is not intrinsic as it apply only to algebraic sets that are explicitly embedded in an affine or projective space.

*   _The maximal length of a [regular sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular\_sequence "Regular sequence") in the coordinate ring A_.

This the algebraic translation of the preceding definition.

*   _The difference between n and the maximal length of the regular sequences contained in I_.

This is the algebraic translation of the fact that the intersection of _n_ – _d_ general hypersurfaces is an algebraic set of dimension _d_.

*   _The degree of the [Hilbert polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert\_polynomial "Hilbert polynomial") of A_.
*   _The degree of the denominator of the [Hilbert series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert\_series "Hilbert series") of A_.

This allows, through a [Gröbner basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr%C3%B6bner_basis "Gröbner basis") computation to compute the dimension of the algebraic set defined by a given [system of polynomial equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_polynomial_equations "System of polynomial equations"). Moreover, the dimension is not changed if the polynomials of the Gröbner basis are replaced with their leading monomials, and if these leading monomials are replaced with their radical (monomials obtained by removing exponents). So:[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension_of_an_algebraic_variety#cite_note-2)

This allows to prove easily that the dimension is invariant under [birational equivalence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birational_equivalence "Birational equivalence").

Dimension of a projective algebraic set
---------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dimension_of_an_algebraic_variety&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Dimension of a projective algebraic set")]

Let _V_ be a [projective algebraic set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_algebraic_set "Projective algebraic set") defined as the set of the common zeros of a homogeneous ideal _I_ in a polynomial ring ![Image 6: {\displaystyle R=K[x_{0},x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n}]}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4f669666a92ba7abc394be27b1cd2817b60c1079) over a field _K_, and let _A_=_R_/_I_ be the [graded algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graded_algebra "Graded algebra") of the polynomials over _V_.

All the definitions of the previous section apply, with the change that, when _A_ or _I_ appear explicitly in the definition, the value of the dimension must be reduced by one. For example, the dimension of _V_ is one less than the Krull dimension of _A_.

Computation of the dimension
----------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dimension_of_an_algebraic_variety&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Computation of the dimension")]

Given a [system of polynomial equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_polynomial_equations "System of polynomial equations") over an algebraically closed field ![Image 7: {\displaystyle K}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2b76fce82a62ed5461908f0dc8f037de4e3686b0), it may be difficult to compute the dimension of the algebraic set that it defines.

Without further information on the system, there is only one practical method, which consists of computing a Gröbner basis and deducing the degree of the denominator of the [Hilbert series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_series "Hilbert series") of the ideal generated by the equations.

The second step, which is usually the fastest, may be accelerated in the following way: Firstly, the Gröbner basis is replaced by the list of its leading monomials (this is already done for the computation of the Hilbert series). Then each monomial like ![Image 8: {\displaystyle {x_{1}}^{e_{1}}\cdots {x_{n}}^{e_{n}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/075d486210de814adf8d53be7a76ee01344aaa39) is replaced by the product of the variables in it: ![Image 9: {\displaystyle x_{1}^{\min(e_{1},1)}\cdots x_{n}^{\min(e_{n},1)}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3dccaf125c6830c70176d55e0b8a7651de06fc41) Then the dimension is the maximal size of a subset _S_ of the variables, such that none of these products of variables depends only on the variables in _S_.

This algorithm is implemented in several [computer algebra systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_algebra_system "Computer algebra system"). For example in [Maple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maple_(software) "Maple (software)"), this is the function _Groebner[HilbertDimension],_ and in [Macaulay2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macaulay2 "Macaulay2"), this is the function _dim_.

The _real dimension_ of a set of real points, typically a [semialgebraic set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semialgebraic_set "Semialgebraic set"), is the dimension of its [Zariski closure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zariski_closure "Zariski closure"). For a semialgebraic set S, the real dimension is one of the following equal integers:[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension_of_an_algebraic_variety#cite_note-3)

For an algebraic set defined over the [reals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number") (that is defined by polynomials with real coefficients), it may occur that the real dimension of the set of its real points is smaller than its dimension as a semi algebraic set. For example, the [algebraic surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_surface "Algebraic surface") of equation ![Image 10: {\displaystyle x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ef3b5f6877cc182edbe473740d7b52f99703d1f2) is an algebraic variety of dimension two, which has only one real point (0, 0, 0), and thus has the real dimension zero.

The real dimension is more difficult to compute than the algebraic dimension. For the case of a real [hypersurface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersurface "Hypersurface") (that is the set of real solutions of a single polynomial equation), there exists a probabilistic algorithm to compute its real dimension.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension_of_an_algebraic_variety#cite_note-4)
