A firefighter fights these fires with the intent to prevent destruction of life, property and the environment. Firefighting is a highly technical profession , which requires years of training and education in order to become proficient. A fire can rapidly spread and endanger many lives; however, with modern firefighting techniques, catastrophe can usually be avoided. To help prevent fires from starting, a firefighter's duties include public education and conducting fire inspections. Because firefighters are often the first responders to victims in critical conditions, firefighters often also provide basic life support as emergency medical technicians or advanced life support as licensed paramedics . Firefighters make up one of the major emergency services , along with the emergency medical service , the police , and many others.
