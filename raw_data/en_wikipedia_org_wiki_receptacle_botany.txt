For other uses, see Receptacle .

In botany , the receptacle refers to vegetative tissues near the end of reproductive stems that are situated below or encase the reproductive organs.

Angiosperms [ edit ] Angiosperms The receptacle (grey) in relation to the ovary (red) in three types of flowers: hypogynous (I), perigynous (II), and epigynous (III) In angiosperms , the receptacle or torus (an older term is thalamus , as in Thalamiflorae ) is the thickened part of a stem (pedicel) from which the flower organs grow. In some accessory fruits , for example the pome and strawberry , the receptacle gives rise to the edible part of the fruit. The fruit of Rubus species is a cluster of drupelets on top of a conical receptacle. When a raspberry is picked, the receptacle separates from the fruit, but in blackberries, it remains attached to the fruit.

[ 1 ] In the daisy family (Compositae or Asteraceae) , small individual flowers are arranged on a round or dome-like structure that is also called receptacle .

Algae and bryophyta [ edit ] Algae Receptacles at the end of Fucus branches In phycology , receptacles occur at the ends of branches of algae mainly in the brown algae or Heterokontophyta in the order Fucales . They are specialised structures which contain the reproductive organs called conceptacles .

[ 2 ] Receptacles also function as a structure that captures food.
