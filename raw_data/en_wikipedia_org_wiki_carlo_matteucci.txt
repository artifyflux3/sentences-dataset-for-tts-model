Biography [ edit ] Carlo Matteucci was born at Forlì , in the province of Romagna , to Vincenzo Matteucci, a physician, and Chiara Folfi. He studied mathematics at the University of Bologna from 1825 to 1828, receiving his doctorate in 1829.

[ 2 ] From 1829 to 1831, he studied at the École Polytechnique in Paris, France. Upon returning to Italy, Matteucci studied at Bologna (1832), Florence , Ravenna (1837) and Pisa . He established himself as the head of the laboratory of the Hospital of Ravenna and became a professor of physics at the local college. In 1840, by recommendation of François Arago (1786–1853), his teacher at the École Polytechnique, to the Grand-Duke of Tuscany , Matteucci accepted a post of professor of physics at the University of Pisa .

Instigated by the work of Luigi Galvani (1737–1798) on bioelectricity, Matteucci began in 1830 a series of experiments which he pursued until his death in 1865. Using a sensitive galvanometer of Leopoldo Nobili , he was able to prove that injured excitable biological tissues generated direct electrical currents , and that they could be summed up by adding elements in series, like in Alessandro Volta ’s (1745-1827) electric pile . Thus, Mateucci was able to develop what he called a " rheoscopic frog ", by using the cut nerve of a frog's leg and its attached muscle as a kind of sensitive electricity detector. His work in bioelectricity influenced directly the research developed by Emil du Bois-Reymond (1818–1896), a student of the great German biologist Johannes Peter Müller (1801–1858) in Berlin, who tried the duplicate Matteucci's experiments and ended up discovering the nerve's action potential . In 1844, for these studies, Matteucci was awarded with the Copley medal by the Royal Society .

From 1847, he took an active part in politics, and in 1860 was chosen an Italian senator , at the same time becoming inspector-general of the Italian telegraph lines. Two years later he was appointed Minister of Education.

Matteucci died in the Ardenza neighbourhood of Livorno in 1868.

Works [ edit ] Lezioni di fisica , 1850 Matteucci was the author of four scientific treatises in physics: Lezioni di fisica (2 vols., Pisa, 1841) Lezioni sui fenomeni fisico-chimici dei corpi viventi (Pisa, 1844) Manuale di telegrafia electrica (Pisa, 1850) Cours spécial sur l'induction, le magnétisme de rotation , etc. (Paris, 1854).

Trattato dei fenomeni elettrofisiologici degli animali (1844) Lezioni di fisica [ Physics lessons ] (in Italian). Pisa: Pieraccini. 1850.

Corso di elettrofisiologia (1857) Corso di elettro-fisiologia [ Course in Electro-physiology ] (in Italian). Torino: Castellazzo e Vercellino. 1861.

His numerous papers were published in the Annales de chimie et de physique (1829–1858); and most of them also appeared at the time in the Italian scientific journals. They relate almost entirely to electrical phenomena, such as the magnetic rotation of light , the action of gas batteries , the effects of torsion on magnetism , [ 3 ] the electric polarization of electrodes , etc., sufficiently complete accounts of which are given in Wiedemann 's Galvanismus .

Nine memoirs, entitled Electro-Physiological Researches , were published in the Philosophical Transactions , 1845–1860. See Bianchi's Carlo Matteucci e l’Italia del suo tempo (Rome, 1874).
