Units of measure [ edit ] The byte has been a commonly used unit of measure for much of the information age to refer to a number of bits . In the early days of computing, it was used for differing numbers of bits based on convention and computer hardware design, but today means 8 bits. A more accurate, but less commonly used name for 8 bits is octet .

Commonly, a decimal SI metric prefix (such as kilo- ) is used with bit and byte to express larger sizes (kilobit, kilobyte). But, this is usually inaccurate since these prefixes are decimal, whereas binary hardware size is usually binary. Customarily, each metric prefix, 1000 n , is used to mean a close approximation of a binary multiple, 1024 n . Often, this distinction is implicit, and therefore, use of metric prefixes can lead to confusion. The IEC binary prefixes (such as kibi- ) allow for accurate description of hardware sizes, but are not commonly used.
