The sources are listed in chronological order.

Lists of metalloids differ since there is no rigorous widely accepted definition of metalloid (or its occasional alias, 'semi-metal'). Individual lists share common ground, with variations occurring at the margins. The elements most often regarded as metalloids are boron, silicon, germanium, arsenic, antimony and tellurium.

[ n 1 ] Other sources may subtract from this list, add a varying number of other elements, or both.

A parenthesized symbol indicates an element whose inclusion in a particular metalloid list is qualified in some way by the author(s). The 'citations' rows show how many and what percentage of the authorities consider each element to be a metalloid, with qualified citations counted as one-half.

It is counted as 0.5 citation.

There is an average of 7.15 elements per metalloid list.

Appearance frequency clusters [ edit ] Clusters of elements and their appearance in the sources Elements cited in the listed sources (as of August 2011; n = 194) have appearance frequencies that occur in clusters of comparable values. The diamonds in the graph mark the mean appearance frequency of each cluster.

Cluster 1 (93%): B, Si, Ge, As, Sb, Te Cluster 2 (44%): Po, At Cluster 3 (24%): Se Cluster 4 (9%): C, Al Cluster 5 (5%): Be, P, Bi Cluster 6 (3%): Sn Cluster 7 (1%): H, Ga, S, I, Pb, Fl, Mc, Lv, Ts The resulting geometric trend line has the formula y = 199.47e −0.7423x and an R 2 value of 0.9962.

[ n 3 ] Elements regarded as metalloids [ edit ] The elements commonly classified as metalloids are boron, silicon, germanium, arsenic, antimony and tellurium.

[ n 4 ] The status of polonium and astatine is not settled. Most authors recognise one or the other, or both, as metalloids; Herman, Hoffmann and Ashcroft, on the basis of relativistic modelling, predict astatine will be a monatomic metal.

[ n 5 ] One or more of carbon, aluminium, phosphorus, selenium, tin or bismuth, these being periodic table neighbours of the elements commonly classified as metalloids, are sometimes recognised as metalloids.

[ n 6 ] Selenium, in particular, is commonly designated as a metalloid in environmental chemistry [ n 7 ] on account of similarities in its aquatic chemistry with that of arsenic and antimony.

[ n 8 ] There are fewer references to beryllium, in spite of its periodic table position adjoining the dividing line between metals and nonmetals . Isolated references in the literature can also be found to the categorisation of other elements as metalloids. These elements include: hydrogen, nitrogen, [ n 9 ] sulfur, [ n 10 ] zinc, [ n 11 ] gallium, [ n 12 ] iodine, [ n 13 ] lead, [ n 14 ] and radon [ n 15 ] (citations are for references other than those listed above).
