Author Ibn Khordadbeh Original title كتاب المسالك والممالك Language Arabic Subject Geography Genre Non-fiction Published c. 870 CE Publication place Abbasid Caliphate (present-day Iran) Media type Manuscript The Book of Roads and Kingdoms ( Arabic : كِتَاب ٱلْمَسَالِك وَٱلْمَمَالِك , romanized : Kitāb al-Masālik wa-l-Mamālik ) is a 9th-century geography text written by the Persian geographer Ibn Khordadbeh . It maps and describes the major trade routes of the time within the Muslim world , and discusses distant trading regions such as Japan , Korea , and China .

[ 1 ] It was written around 870 CE, during the reign of Al-Muʿtamid of the Abbasid Caliphate , while its author was Director of Posts and Police for the Abbasid province of Jibal in modern-day Iran .

The work uses much of the Persian administrative terms, gives considerable attention to pre-Islamic Iranian history , and uses the "native Iranian cosmological division system of the world". These all show "the existence of Iranian sources at the core of the work".

[ 2 ] The book is also referred to in English as The Book of Roads and Provinces .
