( August 2023 ) An optical pulsar is a pulsar which can be detected in the visible spectrum.  There are very few of these known: the Crab Pulsar was detected by stroboscopic techniques in 1969, [ 1 ] [ 2 ] shortly after its discovery in radio waves, at the Steward Observatory . The Vela Pulsar was detected in 1977 at the Anglo-Australian Observatory , and was the faintest star ever imaged at that time.

As of 2018, [update] there are 13 recognized optical pulsars: [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Name of pulsar Magnitude (B) Crab Pulsar (CM Tauri, PSR B0531+21) 16.5 Vela Pulsar 24 PSR B0540-69 (in the Large Magellanic Cloud ) 23 PSR B0656+14 26 PSR B0633+17 (Geminga) 25.5 PSR B1509-58 (*) 25.7 PSR J1023+0038 22 PSR B1055−52 24.9 PSR B1929+10 25.6 PSR B1133+16 28 PSR B0950+08 27.1 PSR J0108−1431 26.4 PSR J0437−4715 20.98±0.09 * Source included but not discussed in paper by source paper.
