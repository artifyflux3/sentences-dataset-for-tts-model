It grants degrees at both undergraduate and graduate levels. Founded in 1919, SFS is the oldest continuously operating school for international affairs in the United States, [ 2 ] [ 3 ] predating the U.S. Foreign Service by six years.

SFS was established by Edmund A. Walsh with the goal of preparing Americans for various international professions in the wake of expanding U.S. involvement in world affairs after World War I . Today, the school hosts a student body of approximately 2,250 from over 100 nations each year. It offers an undergraduate program based in the liberal arts , which leads to the Bachelor of Science in Foreign Service (BSFS) degree, as well as eight interdisciplinary graduate programs.

[ 1 ] Based in Washington, D.C.

, the school also maintains campuses in Doha, Qatar , and Jakarta, Indonesia . SFS is a founding member of the Association of Professional Schools of International Affairs (APSIA), a consortium of the world's leading public policy, public administration, and international affairs schools.

[ 4 ] History [ edit ] 20th century [ edit ] Fr.

Edmund A. Walsh , seen here with Gen.

Douglas MacArthur in 1946, was the founder and first dean of the School of Foreign Service.

With the help of Georgetown University president Fr. John B. Creeden, S.J.

, Fr. Walsh spearheaded the founding of the School of Foreign Service and its establishment was announced on November 25, 1919.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] The school's use of the name “Foreign Service” preceded the formal establishment of the U.S. Foreign Service by six years. The school was envisioned by Fr. Walsh to prepare students for all major forms of foreign representation from commercial , financial , consular to diplomatic .

[ 5 ] In 1921, it graduated its first class of Bachelor of Science in Foreign Service (BSFS) undergraduate students.

[ 6 ] The following year, the school began to offer the first international relations graduate program in the United States, the Master of Science in Foreign Service (MSFS).

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] In August 1932, the SFS was moved to the Healy Hall , a National Historic Landmark .

[ 9 ] In 1958, two years after the death of Fr. Walsh, the school was renamed after him [ 10 ] and moved to the Walsh Building in a ceremony dedicated by President Eisenhower in honor of Fr. Walsh.

[ 11 ] In 1936, the SFS Division of Business and Public Administration launched the Bachelor of Science in Business Administration (BSBA) degree. In 1957, under the leadership of Fr. Joseph Sebes, S.J, the division was spun off from the SFS, becoming the School of Business Administration — later renamed McDonough School of Business in honor of Robert Emmett McDonough (SFS'49).

[ 12 ] In 1962, the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) was founded at Georgetown University as a think tank to conduct policy studies and strategic analyses of political, economic and security issues throughout the world.

[ 13 ] When Henry Kissinger retired from his position as U.S. Secretary of State in 1977, he declined offers of professorship from Harvard , Yale , Penn , Columbia , and Oxford , and decided to teach at Georgetown SFS instead, making CSIS the base for his Washington operations.

[ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] In 1986, the university's board of directors voted to sever all ties with CSIS.

[ 17 ] The SFS is housed in the Intercultural Center on Georgetown's main campus.

Since 1982, the school has been housed in the Edward B. Bunn, S.J. Intercultural Center (ICC) on Georgetown's main campus .

[ 18 ] [ 19 ] In 1989, the Salaam Intercultural Resource Center, which is located on the top floor of the ICC, was opened in a ceremony presided by President Jimmy Carter . The center is a gift by Hany M. Sala'am and has housed the school's MSFS program since 1989.

[ 20 ] U.S. President Jimmy Carter opened the Salaam Intercultural Resource Center, which has housed Georgetown's Master of Science in Foreign Service (MSFS) program since 1989.

In 1975, the Center for Contemporary Arab Studies (CCAS) was launched as the first academic institution in the United States to focusing exclusively on the Arab world . CCAS is a National Resource Center on the Middle East and North Africa (NRC-MENA) and funded by Title VI grants from the U.S. Department of Education , [ 21 ] in addition to donation from Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) governments.

[ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] In 1999, King Abdullah II of Jordan (MSFS'87) [ 25 ] dedicated a new facility for the center.

[ 26 ] In 1978, the Institute for the Study of Diplomacy (ISD) was founded to bring together diplomats, practitioners and scholars to study diplomatic statecraft theory and practice.

[ 27 ] Past ISD fellows include Georgian deputy prime minister Giorgi Baramidze [ 28 ] and Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi .

[ 29 ] From 1975 until 2016, the ISD also awarded the Edward Weintal Prize for Diplomatic Reporting to journalists in recognition of their distinguished reporting on foreign policy and diplomacy.

[ 30 ] [ 31 ] In 1992, following the collapse of the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc , the SFS launched the Pew Economic Freedom Fellows Program to train future leaders of transitional states from Eastern Europe and post-Soviet countries . Notable fellows include Latvian finance minister Uldis Osis , Kazhastan deputy prime minister Kairat Kelimbetov , and Lithuania president Dalia Grybauskaite , who was later awarded an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree by Georgetown University in 2013.

[ 32 ] In 1995, the Security Studies Program (SSP), which was founded in 1977 as the National Security Studies Program (NSSP) and hosted at the U.S. Department of Defense headquarters in the Pentagon , was moved to Georgetown's main campus and incorporated into the SFS.

[ 33 ] 21st century [ edit ] In 2002, the school studied the feasibility of opening a campus in Qatar Foundation's Education City in Doha , Qatar . In 2005, the School of Foreign Service in Qatar (SFS-Q) was officially opened and welcomed its first class of undergraduate students.

[ 34 ] In 2015, the school was renamed to Georgetown University in Qatar (GU-Q) as it broadened its remit to include executive masters and professional programs.

In 2005, Saudi prince Al-Waleed bin Talal gave $20 million to the school's Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding to promote interfaith understanding and the study of the Muslim world . The gift was the second-largest ever given to Georgetown at that point, and the center was renamed in his honor.

[ 35 ] [ 36 ] In 2011, following the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 , U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton launched the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security (GIWPS) and served as its founding chair.

[ 37 ] [ 38 ] SFS Professor Madeleine Albright , who served as U.S. Secretary of State under President Bill Clinton (SFS'68), was a frequent winner of the school’s Outstanding Professor Award.

[ 39 ] In June 2023, the administrators announced the plan to rename the school in honor of the late Madeleine Albright , who served as a professor at SFS both before and after her tenure as U.S. secretary of state . It attracted criticism due to Albright's controversial legacy and the lack of consultation with the school's community members.

[ 40 ] [ 41 ] In October 2023, Georgetown announced that it was no longer considering renaming the school after Albright.

[ 42 ] In November 2023, Indonesian president Joko Widodo announced Georgetown's partnership with the Indonesian government to open a satellite campus in the country.

[ 43 ] [ 44 ] In January 2025, Georgetown SFS Asia-Pacific (GSAP) campus was launched in Jakarta , Indonesia , to offer graduate masters and visiting student programs.
