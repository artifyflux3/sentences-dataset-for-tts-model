[ 1 ] Penguinariums date back at least to 1968, when the Detroit Zoo opened the first in North America and possibly the world.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] The Detroit penguinarium was expanded in 2015 with a US$21 million overhaul funded in part by a US$10 million donation, the largest in the zoo's history, from a single donor.

[ 3 ] In April 2016, the Polk Penguin Conservation Center opened at the Detroit Zoo becoming the world's largest penguinarium.

[ 4 ] However, the exhibit temporarily closed in 2019 for waterproofing repairs as the penguins were moved back into the 1968 exhibit. The conservation center reopened on February 14, 2022.

[ 5 ] As of 2005, the world's second largest penguinarium was located on the Spanish island of Tenerife , where twelve tons of artificial snow were generated daily for the penguins at Loro Parque aquarium.
