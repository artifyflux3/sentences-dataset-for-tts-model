Formation [ edit ] On January 5, 2015, three-time national women's tackle football champions the Boston Militia announced they were discontinuing operations.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] To ensure that women's football would continue in Boston, three former players secured a transfer of ownership of the team from Militia president Ernie Boch, Jr.

Molly Goodwin, Mia Brickhouse, and Erin Baumgartner incorporated as Boston Women's Football, LLC, and reorganized the team under the name Boston Renegades.

Former Militia assistant coaches Michael Muccio and Brie-El Parker stepped into the coordinator positions, and the coaching staff was rounded out with both experienced and new coaches. Notably, former players Molly Goodwin and Jennifer "Coco" Edwards joined the defensive staff as rookie coaches. During the course of the season, the team added former New England Intensity Head Coach Johnny Johnson and former New England Patriots player Patrick Pass as assistant coaches.

Geographically isolated from other teams in the Northeast Region of the Women's Football Alliance (WFA), the Renegades were alone in the New England Division, [ 6 ] and played only five scheduled regular season games instead of the customary eight.

[ 7 ] A sixth game, an interleague match with Independent Women's Football League (IWFL) team the Montreal Blitz , had been cancelled.

[ 8 ] The Boston Renegades opened their inaugural season on April 18, 2015, with a home win against the Central Maryland Seahawks 57–0.

[ 4 ] The Renegades finished with a 3–2 regular-season record. In the WFA National Conference quarterfinals, Boston defeated the West Michigan Mayhem 59–12 at Dilboy Stadium . Then the Renegades hosted a Conference semifinal game against the Chicago Force , but lost 49–18.

Patrick Pass stepped into the defensive coordinator and defensive backs coach positions. Former Boston Militia coach Vernon Crawford returned after a season away to serve as offensive coordinator and assistant head coach. 2015 kicking coach Cliff Ashley was promoted to Special Teams Coordinator. The Renegades added several new coaches, including former Massachusetts Mutiny and Boston Militia player Susan Burtoft.

The Renegades were assigned to the Colonial Division along with the D.C. Divas , Keystone Assault , Philadelphia Phantomz , and Richmond Black Widows . But the deployment this season of a tiered playoff system with seeding determined solely by Massey Ratings made geographical assignments as such irrelevant.

[ 9 ] More meaningful was Boston's inclusion in the top tier of the league, known as Division I or WFA1, where they would compete with D.C., the Chicago Force , Pittsburgh Passion , Atlanta Phoenix , and Cleveland Fusion on the conference level. The proximity of the Philadelphia Phantomz, however, enabled the Renegades to play a customary eight-game schedule by adding home and away dates with the new Division II team.

With a 51–32 victory over Pittsburgh on May 17, Renegades quarterback Allison Cahill reached a new milestone in sports by becoming the first quarterback to attain 100 victories playing exclusively in women's football leagues.

[ 10 ] The Renegades finished with a 5–3 regular-season record, and claimed the third seed in the WFA National Conference playoff bracket. In the conference quarterfinals, Boston defeated the Cleveland Fusion 19–13 at Dilboy Stadium. The Renegades traveled for their conference semifinal match, upsetting the Chicago Force 17–13.

[ 11 ] Boston was unable to overcome the D.C. Divas in the conference final.

Four players — Steph Jeffers, Vicky Eddy, Adrienne Smith, and Rese Woodfine — were named to the U.S. Women's National Football Team . Jeffers and Eddy, along with former player Emily Weinberg, played in the 2017 IFAF Women's World Championship tournament in Canada, and won the gold medal.
