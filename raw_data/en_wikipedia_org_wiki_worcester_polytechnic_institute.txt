Founded in 1865, WPI was one of the United States' first engineering and technology universities and now has 14 academic departments with over 50 bachelor's, master's, and Ph.D. degree programs. It is classified among "R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity".

[ 6 ] History [ edit ] John Boynton (left) and Ichabod Washburn (right) Worcester Polytechnic Institute was founded by self-made tinware manufacturer, John Boynton , and Ichabod Washburn , owner of the world's largest wire mill. Boynton envisioned science schooling that would elevate the social position of the mechanic and manufacturer, but not necessarily teach the skills needed to become either. Washburn, on the other hand, wanted to teach technical skills through a sophisticated apprenticeship approach. Boynton consulted Seth Sweetser, a pastor, for ways to realize his vision. By chance it happened that Ichabod Washburn had previously consulted Sweetser about the proper way to actualize his own vision.

[ 7 ] Sweetser drafted a letter expressing Boynton's and Washburn's wish, a "liberal proposal to found a Free School for Industrial Science" in Worcester and called for a meeting of supporters. After a first meeting the following notice appeared in the Worcester Palladium: "A Gentleman, who for the present withholds his name from the public, offers a fund of $100,000 for the establishment of a scientific school in Worcester, upon the condition that our citizens shall furnish the necessary land and buildings." Further funding and land grants for the university were given by Stephen Salisbury II, who was an influential merchant and later served as the first president of the institute's board of directors.

[ 8 ] In response to this anonymous request, more than 225 Worcester citizens and the workers at 20 of the city's factories and machine shops contributed to the construction of the original building. On May 10, 1865, after House and Senate approval, the secretary of the commonwealth recorded the Institute as a legal corporation, and it came into formal existence.

[ 7 ] Both Boynton and Washburn died before the opening of the college on November 11, 1868. On that day, Charles O. Thompson, the first president of the Institute, inaugurated the Worcester County Free Institute of Industrial Science.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] WPI was led in its early years Thompson.

[ 11 ] WPI continuously expanded its campus and programs throughout the early twentieth century, eventually including graduate studies and a program in electrical engineering . During World War II , WPI offered defense engineering courses and was selected as one of the colleges to direct the V-12 Navy College Training Program .

[ 12 ] During this time, WPI suffered from the lack of a unified library system, well-maintained buildings, and national recognition. This changed under the leadership of president Harry P. Storke from 1962 to 1969. Building on growth under Arthur Bronwell 's presidency, Storke brought significant change to the school in what would be known as the WPI Plan. The Plan called for the creation of three projects and drastically redesigned the curriculum to address how a student learns. The Storke administration also launched a capital campaign that resulted in the creation of the George C. Gordon Library, added residence halls, an auditorium, and a modern chemistry building. Furthermore, women were first allowed to enter WPI in February 1968.

[ 13 ] Through the six month period from July 2021 to January 2022, seven WPI undergraduate and graduate students lost their lives, making local and national news. Two of the deaths occurred prior to the school year.

[ 14 ] Five were confirmed or apparent suicides.

[ 15 ] Following the third death, which occurred in September 2021, WPI set up an emergency mental health task force, and requested an independent review by nearby Riverside Trauma Center. In 2022, following the task force's dissolution, WPI announced the creation of a new Center for Well-Being.

[ 14 ] In 2025, the university was classified as a "Research 1: Very High Research Spending and Doctorate Production" university.

[ 16 ] Campus [ edit ] Set in an urban environment in New England's second largest city, [ 17 ] WPI's main campus is entirely privately owned, ungated, and uninterrupted by public roads. The 'Two Towers' shown in old WPI logos show the clock tower of Boynton Hall and the arm and hammer weathervane of the Washburn Shops. The Two Towers symbolize Theory and Practice, which are the foundation of the university and still the approach used today. Boynton was completed in 1868 and Washburn followed shortly after that same year.

[ 18 ] [ 19 ] WPI's school colors, Crimson and Gray, were inspired by the natural pigmentation of a beech tree's bark and foliage that grew near the foot of Boynton Hill. The tree was planted in 1945 and presently stands over 100 feet (30 m) tall.

[ 20 ] WPI had one of 35 civilian research nuclear reactors licensed to operate in the United States. It was built and used in research during the height of the Cold War but the school's nuclear program ended at the turn of the century. The reactor was decommissioned and filled-in early in 2018 due to heightened security around reactors post- 9/11 and lack of need.

[ 21 ] A large bronze statue of Gompei the Goat stands at the quad side of the Bartlett Center, WPI's admission building. Gompei was an actual goat given as a gift by the class of 1891 and eventually became the school's official mascot. It was named after the first elected goat keeper, Gompei Kuwada, chosen for his initials (G.K.). The original bronze goat head is located in the Skull Tomb, on a shelf with carved rocks and empty liquor bottles.

[ 22 ] The Innovation Studio and Messenger Hall, a US$49 million, 78,000-square-foot (7,200 m 2 ) residential and classroom facility, was dedicated in 2018. The Innovation Studio (formerly the Foisie Innovation Studio), designed by Gensler, contains a robotics lab, a makerspace, various student-used manufacturing technology (3-D printers, etc.), and high-tech classrooms. Messenger Hall is a residence hall with 140 beds and tech suites.

[ 23 ] The Innovation Studio was originally named the Foisie Innovation Studio, after Robert Foisie, WPI's biggest donor ever. Controversy emerged surrounding the man's donations, which totaled $63 million across his lifetime, when his wife and children alleged in public and legal filings that he had participated in various criminal practices, most notably stashing money overseas during his divorce and attempting to hire a hitman to kill his son. Following Robert's death in 2018, WPI began in 2021 to erase his name from the Innovation Studio and Business School (formerly the Foisie Business School). This was conducted in accordance with a settlement with Robert's wife, Janet Foisie.

[ 24 ] [ 25 ] Sanford Riley Hall, the first residence hall built on campus (1927) The Beech Tree stands over 100 feet (30 m) tall Earle Bridge Higgins House Boynton Hall, WPI's main administrative building Goddard Hall, named for alumnus Robert H. Goddard Foisie Innovation Studio (opened August 2018) Alden Memorial [ 19 ] Academics [ edit ] Project-based learning system [ edit ] WPI's curriculum is focused on project-based learning , an emphasis established in 1970 as part of what was called the WPI Plan.

[ 26 ] WPI Plan [ edit ] WPI has 7-week terms, labeled A through D, with optional E Terms (session 1 and session 2) in the summer. Students typically take three courses during each term, which allows students to complete a year's worth of Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics, etc. in only one semester. The graduate student calendar follows a mixed schedule of conventional two semester classes and traditional 7-week courses.

[ 27 ] Unlike many other universities, WPI does not have required academic prerequisites.

[ 27 ] Global Projects Program [ edit ] Through the Global Projects Program, over 60% of WPI students complete at least one of their required projects at an off-campus Project Center. Through the Global Projects Program, WPI sends more engineering students abroad than any US college or university. As of the 2019–2020 academic year, the program included over 50 Project Centers on six continents.

[ 28 ] Interactive Qualifying Project [ edit ] The Interactive Qualifying Project (IQP) is described as a "project which relates technology and science to society or human needs." [ 29 ] This project is very broad in scope, encompassing a wide variety of topics and actions. Generally, IQPs are designed to solve a societal problem using technology. This can range from improving high school science education to redesigning an irrigation system in Thailand. This project is often done off-campus through WPI's Global Projects Program. From an educational perspective, the IQP serves to emphasize team-based work and introduces a real-world responsibility absent from courses. Many IQPs have made a significant impact on the community in which they are done.

Major Qualifying Project [ edit ] The Major Qualifying Project (MQP) assesses knowledge in a student's field of study. As mentioned above, this project is similar to a senior thesis, with students doing independent research or design. MQPs are often funded by either WPI or external corporations. Topics of MQPs done in the recent past include the design of the MIR 2 space station life support system module, a study of the effects of stress and nicotine on ADHD, the design of a research rocket, a mathematical viscoelastic cell motility model, experimental research of liquid crystals using atomic force microscopy, and the design of polymers for medicine delivery.

[ 30 ] Rankings and reputation [ edit ] Academic rankings National Forbes [ 31 ] 93 U.S. News & World Report [ 32 ] 86 Washington Monthly [ 33 ] 99 WSJ /College Pulse [ 34 ] 120 Global ARWU [ 35 ] 901-1000 QS [ 36 ] 801-1000 THE [ 37 ] 601-800 U.S. News & World Report [ 38 ] 1358 WPI was ranked tied for 86th among national universities in U.S. News & World Report ' s 2025 review of "Best Colleges" in the U.S.

U.S. News & World Report also rated it tied at 63rd for "Most Innovative", 77th for "Best Value", and tied for 291st for "Top Performers on Social Mobility" among national universities.

[ 39 ] In 2013, Businessweek ranked WPI No. 1 in the nation for its part-time Master of Business Administration (MBA) program, and No. 1 in the nation for student satisfaction in the program.

[ 40 ] In August 2019, Forbes magazine's annual ranking of "America's Top Colleges" placed WPI at No. 93. "Forbes' college ranking is distinguished by its consumer-centric approach," said Caroline Howard, Director of Editorial Operations, Forbes. "The evaluation of the 650 undergraduate institutions is based exclusively on the quality of the education they provide, the experiences of the students and their post-graduate success and financial well-being." [ 41 ] In 2017, WPI received a gold rating through Sustainability, Tracking, Assessment, and Rating System (also known as STARS) for its sustainability efforts.

[ 42 ] [ 43 ] Worcester Polytechnic Institute is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education .

[ 44 ] In 2025, U.S. News ranked WPI 18th nationally for return on investment .

[ 45 ] Campus life [ edit ] Traditions [ edit ] Marching and Pep Band WPI Marching and Pep Band — The band is a student-run organization with approximately 100 members.

[ 46 ] Weekend Movies – Every Saturday and Sunday, a new film is shown on the WPI campus in Fuller Laboratories. WPI is one of the few universities capable of showing both 35 mm film and 70 mm film in the same hall.

[ 47 ] Winter Ball – A ballroom dance social hosted by WPI's Ballroom Dance Team during the winter where couples in evening wear can learn and dance ballroom dances such as Waltz, Foxtrot, ChaCha, and Rumba in Alden Memorial.

[ 48 ] Athletics [ edit ] Main article: WPI Engineers WPI supports 20 varsity athletic teams that compete in the New England Women's and Men's Athletic Conference , New England Wrestling Association, and the Eastern College Athletic Conference . WPI athletic teams compete intercollegiately at the NCAA Division III level.

Athletic center [ edit ] WPI Sports and Recreation Center Gompei the Goat, WPI mascot WPI's 145,000-square-foot (13,500 m 2 ), LEED-certified building Sports and Recreation Center was dedicated in 2012, and includes racquetball and squash courts, jogging track, and swimming pool.

[ 49 ] Mascot [ edit ] In the spring of 1891, the class of 1893 stole a goat and used it as a mascot. The goat was tended by a Japanese-born student, Gumpei (Gompei) Kuwada, [ 50 ] because he was the only one with the initials G.K. in reference to the job of goat keeper.

[ 51 ] The mascot of WPI is still a goat and in honor of the first goat keeper the mascot's name is Gompei.

[ 50 ] Media [ edit ] Tech News is WPI's student newspaper, published weekly on Tuesdays. It has gone through multiple names, including The Towers , and was often published biweekly.

[ 52 ] [ 53 ] Renamed in 2018, it is now published online and on paper.

[ 4 ] Official campus publications include WPI Today for news and media releases and WPI Journal , the university's magazine.

[ 54 ] Wireless Association (W1YK) [ edit ] Charter of affiliation of the Wireless Association with the ARRL (1920) The WPI Wireless Association is regarded as the first College Amateur Radio Club to be on the air.

[ 55 ] The current club has members with licenses ranging from Technician to the highest class, Amateur Extra. The club currently and has operated for decades out of the radio shack on the roof of Salisbury Laboratories. The club manages several public repeaters that reach around Worcester such as the Higgins Repeater.

[ 56 ] W1YK, the official Federal Communications Commission -licensed callsign of the club, and its members participate in the American Radio Relay League Sweepstakes each year, including the November Sweeps. The members of the club participate in marathons, triathlons, and other events that need radio operators.
