The Pyrrhonists , Epicureans , and Stoics use the term to refer to information received through the senses and arising in thoughts.

[ 1 ] In Stoicism, the phantasiai represent pre-cognitive judgments originating from our previous experiences or our subconscious thinking. The founder of Stoicism, Zeno of Citium , suggested that the soul is imprinted by the senses much in the same way as a signet ring imprints its shape in soft wax; [ 2 ] all psychological states and activities, such as mental assent, cognition, impulse, and knowledge are all either extensions or responses to phantasiai.

[ 2 ] According to Epictetus , [ 3 ] the sage avoids doxa , a weak or false belief, by withholding assent when conditions do not permit a clear and certain grasp of the truth of a matter. Some phantasiai experienced in perceptually ideal circumstances, however, are so clear and distinct that they could only come from a real object; these were said to be kataleptikê (fit to grasp). The kataleptic phantasiai compels assent by its very clarity and represents the criterion of truth .
