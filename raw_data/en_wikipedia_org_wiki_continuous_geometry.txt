Von Neumann was motivated by his discovery of von Neumann algebras with a dimension function taking a continuous range of dimensions, and the first example of a continuous geometry other than projective space was the projections of the hyperfinite type II factor .

Definition [ edit ] Menger and Birkhoff gave axioms for projective geometry in terms of the lattice of linear subspaces of projective space. Von Neumann's axioms for continuous geometry are a weakened form of these axioms.

A continuous geometry is a lattice L with the following properties L is modular .

L is complete .

The lattice operations ∧, ∨ satisfy a certain continuity property, ( ⋀ ⋀ α α ∈ ∈ A a α α ) ∨ ∨ b = ⋀ ⋀ α α ( a α α ∨ ∨ b ) {\displaystyle {\Big (}\bigwedge _{\alpha \in A}a_{\alpha }{\Big )}\lor b=\bigwedge _{\alpha }(a_{\alpha }\lor b)} , where A is a directed set and if α < β then a α < a β , and the same condition with ∧ and ∨ reversed.

Every element in L has a complement (not necessarily unique). A complement of an element a is an element b with a ∧ b = 0 , a ∨ b = 1 , where 0 and 1 are the minimal and maximal elements of L .

L is irreducible: this means that the only elements with unique complements are 0 and 1.

Examples [ edit ] Finite-dimensional complex projective space, or rather its set of linear subspaces, is a continuous geometry, with dimensions taking values in the discrete set { 0 , 1 / n , 2 / n , … … , 1 } {\displaystyle \{0,1/{\textit {n}}\,,2/{\textit {n}}\,,\dots ,1\}} The projections of a finite type II von Neumann algebra form a continuous geometry with dimensions taking values in the unit interval [ 0 , 1 ] {\displaystyle [0,1]} .

Kaplansky (1955) showed that any orthocomplemented complete modular lattice is a continuous geometry.

If V is a vector space over a field (or division ring ) F , then there is a natural map from the lattice PG( V ) of subspaces of V to the lattice of subspaces of V ⊗ ⊗ F 2 {\displaystyle V\otimes F^{2}} that multiplies dimensions by 2. So we can take a direct limit of P G ( F ) ⊂ ⊂ P G ( F 2 ) ⊂ ⊂ P G ( F 4 ) ⊂ ⊂ P G ( F 8 ) ⋯ ⋯ {\displaystyle PG(F)\subset PG(F^{2})\subset PG(F^{4})\subset PG(F^{8})\cdots } This has a dimension function taking values all dyadic rationals between 0 and 1. Its completion is a continuous geometry containing elements of every dimension in [ 0 , 1 ] {\displaystyle [0,1]} . This geometry was constructed by von Neumann (1936b) , and is called the continuous geometry over F Dimension [ edit ] This section summarizes some of the results of von Neumann (1998 , Part I). These results are similar to, and were motivated by, von Neumann's work on projections in von Neumann algebras.

Two elements a and b of L are called perspective , written a ∼ b ,  if they have a common complement. This is an equivalence relation on L ; the proof that it is transitive is quite hard.

The equivalence classes A , B , ... of L have a total order on them defined by A ≤ B if there is some a in A and b in B with a ≤ b . (This need not hold for all a in A and b in B .) The dimension function D from L to the unit interval is defined as follows.

If equivalence classes A and B contain elements a and b with a ∧ b = 0 then their sum A + B is defined to be the equivalence class of a ∨ b . Otherwise the sum A + B is not defined. For a positive integer n , the product nA is defined to be the sum of n copies of A , if this sum is defined.

For equivalence classes A and B with A not {0} the integer [ B : A ] is defined to be the unique integer n ≥ 0 such that B = nA + C with C < B .

For equivalence classes A and B with A not {0} the real number ( B : A ) is defined to be the limit of [ B : C ] / [ A : C ] as C runs through a minimal sequence: this means that either C contains a minimal nonzero element, or an infinite sequence of nonzero elements each of which is at most half the preceding one.

D ( a ) is defined to be ({ a } : {1}) , where { a } and {1} are the equivalence classes containing a and 1.

The image of D can be the whole unit interval, or the set of numbers 0 , 1 / n , 2 / n , … … , 1 {\displaystyle 0,1/{\textit {n}}\,,2/{\textit {n}}\,,\dots ,1} for some positive integer n . Two elements of L have the same image under D if and only if they are perspective, so it gives an injection from the equivalence classes to a subset of the unit interval. The dimension function D has the properties: If a < b then D ( a ) < D ( b ) D ( a ∨ b ) + D ( a ∧ b ) = D ( a ) + D ( b ) D ( a ) = 0 if and only if a = 0 , and D ( a ) = 1 if and only if a = 1 0 ≤ D ( a ) ≤ 1 Coordinatization theorem [ edit ] In projective geometry, the Veblen–Young theorem states that a projective geometry of dimension at least 3 is isomorphic to the projective geometry of a vector space over a division ring. This can be restated as saying that the subspaces in the projective geometry correspond to the principal right ideals of a matrix algebra over a division ring.

Von Neumann generalized this to continuous geometries, and more generally to complemented modular lattices,  as follows ( von Neumann 1998 , Part II). His theorem states that if a complemented modular lattice L has order [ when defined as?

] at least 4, then the elements of L correspond to the principal right ideals of a von Neumann regular ring . More precisely if the lattice has order n then the von Neumann regular ring can be taken to be an n by n matrix ring M n ( R ) over another von Neumann regular ring R . Here a complemented modular lattice has order n if it has a homogeneous basis of n elements, where a basis is n elements a 1 , ..., a n such that a i ∧ a j = 0 if i ≠ j , and a 1 ∨ ... ∨ a n = 1 , and a basis is called homogeneous if any two elements are perspective. The order of a lattice need not be unique; for example, any lattice has order 1. The condition that the lattice has order  at least 4 corresponds to the condition that the dimension is at least 3 in the Veblen–Young theorem, as a projective space has dimension at least 3 if and only if it has a set of at least  4 independent points.

Conversely, the principal right ideals of a von Neumann regular ring form a complemented modular lattice ( von Neumann 1998 , Part II theorem 2.4).

Suppose that R is a von Neumann regular ring and L its lattice of principal right ideals, so that L is a complemented modular lattice. Neumann showed that L is a continuous geometry if and only if R is an irreducible complete rank ring .
