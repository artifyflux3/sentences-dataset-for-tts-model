Buckley Condensed Matter Prize ) American award in condensed matter physics The Oliver E. Buckley Condensed Matter Prize is an annual award given by the American Physical Society "to recognize and encourage outstanding theoretical or experimental contributions to condensed matter physics ." [ 1 ] It was endowed by AT&T Bell Laboratories as a means of recognizing outstanding scientific work. The prize is named in honor of Oliver Ellsworth Buckley , a former president of Bell Labs .

[ 2 ] Before 1982, it was known as the Oliver E. Buckley Solid State Prize . It is one of the most prestigious awards in the field of condensed matter physics.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] The prize is normally awarded to one person but may be shared if multiple recipients contributed to the same accomplishments.  Nominations are active for three years. The prize was endowed in 1952 and first awarded in 1953. Since 2012, the prize has been co-sponsored by HTC-VIA Group.
