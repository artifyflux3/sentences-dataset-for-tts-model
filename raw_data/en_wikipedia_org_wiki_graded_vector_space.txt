For "pure" vector spaces, the concept has been introduced in homological algebra , and it is widely used for graded algebras , which are graded vector spaces with additional structures.

Integer gradation [ edit ] Let N {\displaystyle \mathbb {N} } be the set of non-negative integers . An N {\textstyle \mathbb {N} } -graded vector space , often called simply a graded vector space without the prefix N {\displaystyle \mathbb {N} } , is a vector space V together with a decomposition into a direct sum of the form V = ⨁ ⨁ n ∈ ∈ N V n {\displaystyle V=\bigoplus _{n\in \mathbb {N} }V_{n}} where each V n {\displaystyle V_{n}} is a vector space.  For a given n the elements of V n {\displaystyle V_{n}} are then called homogeneous elements of degree n .

Graded vector spaces are common.  For example the set of all polynomials in one or several variables forms a graded vector space, where the homogeneous elements of degree n are exactly the linear combinations of monomials of degree n .

General gradation [ edit ] The subspaces of a graded vector space need not be indexed by the set of natural numbers, and may be indexed by the elements of any set I .  An I -graded vector space V is a vector space together with a decomposition into a direct sum of subspaces indexed by elements i of the set I : V = ⨁ ⨁ i ∈ ∈ I V i .

{\displaystyle V=\bigoplus _{i\in I}V_{i}.} Therefore, an N {\displaystyle \mathbb {N} } -graded vector space, as defined above, is just an I -graded vector space where the set I is N {\displaystyle \mathbb {N} } (the set of natural numbers ).

The case where I is the ring Z / 2 Z {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} /2\mathbb {Z} } (the elements 0 and 1) is particularly important in physics . A ( Z / 2 Z ) {\displaystyle (\mathbb {Z} /2\mathbb {Z} )} -graded vector space is also known as a supervector space .

Homomorphisms [ edit ] "Homogeneous linear map" redirects here. For the more general concept, see Graded module homomorphism .

For general index sets I , a linear map between two I -graded vector spaces f : V → W is called a graded linear map if it preserves the grading of homogeneous elements. A graded linear map is also called a homomorphism (or morphism ) of graded vector spaces, or homogeneous linear map : f ( V i ) ⊆ ⊆ W i {\displaystyle f(V_{i})\subseteq W_{i}} for all i in I .

For a fixed field and a fixed index set , the graded vector spaces form a category whose morphisms are the graded linear maps.

When I is a commutative monoid (such as the natural numbers), then one may more generally define linear maps that are homogeneous of any degree i in I by the property f ( V j ) ⊆ ⊆ W i + j {\displaystyle f(V_{j})\subseteq W_{i+j}} for all j in I , where "+" denotes the monoid operation. If moreover I satisfies the cancellation property so that it can be embedded into an abelian group A that it generates (for instance the integers if I is the natural numbers), then one may also define linear maps that are homogeneous of degree i in A by the same property (but now "+" denotes the group operation in A ). Specifically, for i in I a linear map will be homogeneous of degree − i if f ( V i + j ) ⊆ ⊆ W j {\displaystyle f(V_{i+j})\subseteq W_{j}} for all j in I , while f ( V j ) = 0 {\displaystyle f(V_{j})=0\,} if j − i is not in I .

Just as the set of linear maps from a vector space to itself forms an associative algebra (the algebra of endomorphisms of the vector space), the sets of homogeneous linear maps from a space to itself – either restricting degrees to I or allowing any degrees in the group A – form associative graded algebras over those index sets.

Operations on graded vector spaces [ edit ] Some operations on vector spaces can be defined for graded vector spaces as well.

Given two I -graded vector spaces V and W , their direct sum has underlying vector space V ⊕ W with gradation ( V ⊕ W ) i = V i ⊕ W i .

If I is a semigroup , then the tensor product of two I -graded vector spaces V and W is another I -graded vector space, V ⊗ ⊗ W {\displaystyle V\otimes W} , with gradation ( V ⊗ ⊗ W ) i = ⨁ ⨁ { ( j , k ) : j + k = i } V j ⊗ ⊗ W k .

{\displaystyle (V\otimes W)_{i}=\bigoplus _{\left\{\left(j,k\right)\,:\;j+k=i\right\}}V_{j}\otimes W_{k}.} Hilbert–Poincaré series [ edit ] Given a N {\displaystyle \mathbb {N} } -graded vector space that is finite-dimensional for every n ∈ ∈ N , {\displaystyle n\in \mathbb {N} ,} its Hilbert–Poincaré series is the formal power series ∑ ∑ n ∈ ∈ N dim K ⁡ ⁡ ( V n ) t n .

{\displaystyle \sum _{n\in \mathbb {N} }\dim _{K}(V_{n})\,t^{n}.} From the formulas above, the Hilbert–Poincaré series of a direct sum and of a tensor product 
of graded vector spaces (finite dimensional in each degree) are respectively the sum and the product of the corresponding Hilbert–Poincaré series.
