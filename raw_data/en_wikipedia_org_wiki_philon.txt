See also: Philo (disambiguation) Philon ( Greek : Φίλων ), Athenian architect of the 4th century BC, is known as the planner of two important works:  the portico of twelve Doric columns to the great Hall of the Mysteries at Eleusis (work commissioned by Demetrius of Phalerum about 318 BC) and, under the administration of Lycurgus , an arsenal in Piraeus, Athens' port city.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Of the last we have exact knowledge from an inscription. E. A. Gardner observes that it "is perhaps known to us more in detail than any other lost monument of antiquity." [ 3 ] It was to hold the rigging of the galleys ; and was so contrived that all its contents were visible from a central hall, and so liable to the inspection of the Athenian democracy . He is known to have written books on the Athenian arsenal and on the proportions of temple buildings, [ 4 ] but these are now lost.

Vitruvius (vii, introduction) quotes Philon on the proportions of temples, and on the naval arsenal which was at the port of Piraeus .

Philon's arsenal was destroyed by the forces of Lucius Cornelius Sulla in the Roman conquest of Athens in 86 BC .
