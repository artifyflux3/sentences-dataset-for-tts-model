The **astronomical unit** (symbol: **au**[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit#cite_note-IAUresB2-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit#cite_note-mnras_style-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit#cite_note-AAS_style-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit#cite_note-4) or **AU**) is a [unit of length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_of_length "Unit of length") defined to be exactly equal to 149 597 870 700 m.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit#cite_note-5) Historically, the astronomical unit was conceived as the average Earth-Sun distance (the average of Earth's [aphelion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphelion "Aphelion") and [perihelion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perihelion "Perihelion")), before its modern redefinition in 2012.

The astronomical unit is used primarily for measuring distances within the [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System "Solar System") or around other stars. It is also a fundamental component in the definition of another unit of astronomical length, the [parsec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec "Parsec").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit#cite_note-au_parsec-6) One au is approximately equivalent to 499 [light-seconds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-second "Light-second").

History of symbol usage
-----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Astronomical_unit&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: History of symbol usage")]

A variety of unit symbols and abbreviations have been in use for the astronomical unit. In a 1976 resolution, the [International Astronomical Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Astronomical_Union "International Astronomical Union")(IAU) had used the symbol _A_ to denote a length equal to the astronomical unit.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit#cite_note-IAU76-7) In the astronomical literature, the symbol AU is common. In 2006, the [International Bureau of Weights and Measures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Bureau_of_Weights_and_Measures "International Bureau of Weights and Measures") (BIPM) had recommended ua as the symbol for the unit, from the French "unité astronomique".[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit#cite_note-Bureau_International_des_Poids_et_Mesures_2006_126-8) In the non-normative Annex C to [ISO 80000-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_80000-3 "ISO 80000-3"):2006 (later withdrawn), the symbol of the astronomical unit was also ua.

In 2012, the IAU, noting "that various symbols are presently in use for the astronomical unit", recommended the use of the symbol "au".[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit#cite_note-IAUresB2-1) The [scientific journals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_journal "Scientific journal") published by the [American Astronomical Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Astronomical_Society "American Astronomical Society") and the [Royal Astronomical Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Astronomical_Society "Royal Astronomical Society") subsequently adopted this symbol.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit#cite_note-AAS_style-3)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit#cite_note-9) In the 2014 revision and 2019 edition of the SI Brochure, the BIPM used the unit symbol "au".[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit#cite_note-SI_Brochure2012-10)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit#cite_note-SI_Brochure2019-11) ISO 80000-3:2019, which replaces ISO 80000-3:2006, does not mention the astronomical unit.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit#cite_note-12)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit#cite_note-13)

Development of unit definition
------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Astronomical_unit&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Development of unit definition")]

[Earth's orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_orbit "Earth's orbit") around the Sun is an [ellipse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipse "Ellipse"). The [semi-major axis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-major_axis "Semi-major axis") of this [elliptic orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_orbit "Elliptic orbit") is defined to be half of the straight [line segment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_segment "Line segment") that joins the [perihelion and aphelion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perihelion_and_aphelion "Perihelion and aphelion"). The centre of the Sun lies on this straight line segment, but not at its midpoint. Because ellipses are well-understood shapes, measuring the points of its extremes defined the exact shape mathematically, and made possible calculations for the entire orbit as well as predictions based on observation. In addition, it mapped out exactly the largest straight-line distance that Earth traverses over the course of a year, defining times and places for observing the largest [parallax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax "Parallax") (apparent shifts of position) in nearby stars. Knowing Earth's shift and a star's shift enabled the star's distance to be calculated. But all measurements are subject to some degree of error or uncertainty, and the uncertainties in the length of the astronomical unit only increased uncertainties in the stellar distances. Improvements in precision have always been a key to improving astronomical understanding. Throughout the twentieth century, measurements became increasingly precise and sophisticated, and ever more dependent on accurate observation of the effects described by [Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein")'s [theory of relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_relativity "Theory of relativity") and upon the mathematical tools it used.

Improving measurements were continually checked and cross-checked by means of improved understanding of the laws of [celestial mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_mechanics "Celestial mechanics"), which govern the motions of objects in space. The expected positions and distances of objects at an established time are calculated (in au) from these laws, and assembled into a collection of data called an [ephemeris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephemeris "Ephemeris"). [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA "NASA")'s[Jet Propulsion Laboratory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_Propulsion_Laboratory "Jet Propulsion Laboratory") HORIZONS System provides one of several ephemeris computation services.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit#cite_note-Horizons-14)

In 1976, to establish a more precise measure for the astronomical unit, the IAU formally [adopted a new definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAU_(1976)_System_of_Astronomical_Constants "IAU (1976) System of Astronomical Constants"). Although directly based on the then-best available observational measurements, the definition was recast in terms of the then-best mathematical derivations from celestial mechanics and planetary ephemerides. It stated that "the astronomical unit of length is that length (_A_) for which the [Gaussian gravitational constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_gravitational_constant "Gaussian gravitational constant") (_k_) takes the value 0.017 202 098 95 when the units of measurement are the astronomical units of length, mass and time".[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit#cite_note-IAU76-7)[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit#cite_note-Tr%C3%BCmper-15)[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit#cite_note-Fairbridge-16) Equivalently, by this definition, one au is "the radius of an unperturbed circular Newtonian orbit about the sun of a particle having infinitesimal mass, moving with an [angular frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_frequency "Angular frequency") of 0.017 202 098 95 radians per day";[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit#cite_note-SIbrochure-17) or alternatively that length for which the [heliocentric gravitational constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_gravitational_parameter "Standard gravitational parameter") (the product _G_ M☉) is equal to (0.017 202 098 95)2 au 3/d 2, when the length is used to describe the positions of objects in the Solar System.

Subsequent explorations of the Solar System by [space probes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_probe "Space probe") made it possible to obtain precise measurements of the relative positions of the [inner planets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System#Inner_planets "Solar System") and other objects by means of [radar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar "Radar") and [telemetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telemetry "Telemetry"). As with all radar measurements, these rely on measuring the time taken for [photons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photons "Photons") to be reflected from an object. Because all photons move at the [speed of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light "Speed of light") in vacuum, a fundamental constant of the universe, the distance of an object from the probe is calculated as the product of the speed of light and the measured time. However, for precision the calculations require adjustment for things such as the motions of the probe and object while the photons are transiting. In addition, the measurement of the time itself must be translated to a standard scale that accounts for [relativistic time dilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativistic_time_dilation "Relativistic time dilation"). Comparison of the ephemeris positions with time measurements expressed in [Barycentric Dynamical Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barycentric_Dynamical_Time "Barycentric Dynamical Time")(TDB) leads to a value for the speed of light in astronomical units per day (of 86 400 s). By 2009, the IAU had updated its standard measures to reflect improvements, and calculated the speed of light at 173.144 632 6847(69)au/d (TDB).[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit#cite_note-18)

In 1983, the CIPM modified the [International System of Units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units "International System of Units") (SI) to make the metre defined as the distance travelled in a vacuum by light in 1/299 792 458 s. This replaced the previous definition, valid between 1960 and 1983, which was that the metre equalled a certain number of wavelengths of a certain emission line of krypton-86. (The reason for the change was an improved method of measuring the speed of light.) The speed of light could then be expressed exactly as _c_ 0 = 299 792 458 m/s, a standard also adopted by the [IERS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IERS "IERS") numerical standards.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit#cite_note-IERS-19) From this definition and the 2009 IAU standard, the time for light to traverse an astronomical unit is found to be _τ_ A = 499.004 783 8061±0.000 000 01 s, which is slightly more than 8 minutes 19 seconds. By multiplication, the best IAU 2009 estimate was _A_= _c_ 0 _τ_ A= 149 597 870 700±3 m,[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit#cite_note-Captaine-20) based on a comparison of Jet Propulsion Laboratory and [IAA–RAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Academy_of_Sciences "Russian Academy of Sciences") ephemerides.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit#cite_note-IAU-21)[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit#cite_note-Pitjeva09-22)[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit#cite_note-23)

In 2006, the BIPM reported a value of the astronomical unit as 1.495 978 706 91(6)×10 11 m.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit#cite_note-Bureau_International_des_Poids_et_Mesures_2006_126-8) In the 2014 revision of the SI Brochure, the BIPM recognised the IAU's 2012 redefinition of the astronomical unit as 149 597 870 700 m.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit#cite_note-SI_Brochure2012-10)

This estimate was still derived from observation and measurements subject to error, and based on techniques that did not yet standardize all relativistic effects, and thus were not constant for all observers. In 2012, finding that the equalization of relativity alone would make the definition overly complex, the IAU simply used the 2009 estimate to redefine the astronomical unit as a conventional unit of length directly tied to the metre (exactly 149 597 870 700 m).[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit#cite_note-Captaine-20)[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit#cite_note-Nature2012-24) The new definition recognizes as a consequence that the astronomical unit has reduced importance, limited in use to a convenience in some applications.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit#cite_note-Captaine-20)

1 astronomical unit= 149 597 870 700[metres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre "Metre") (by definition)
= 149,597,870.7 [kilometres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilometre "Kilometre") (exactly)
≈ 92,955,807.2730 [miles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mile "Mile")
≈ 499.004 783 836[light-seconds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-second "Light-second")
≈ 1.581 250 740 98×10−5[light-years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-year "Light-year")
≈ 4.848 136 811 13×10−6[parsecs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec "Parsec")

This definition makes the speed of light, defined as exactly 299 792 458 m/s, equal to exactly 299 792 458×86 400÷149 597 870 700 or about 173.144 632 674 240 au/d, some 60 parts per [trillion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(numbers)#1012 "Orders of magnitude (numbers)") less than the 2009 estimate.

Usage and significance
----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Astronomical_unit&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Usage and significance")]

With the definitions used before 2012, the astronomical unit was dependent on the [heliocentric gravitational constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentric_gravitational_constant "Heliocentric gravitational constant"), that is the product of the [gravitational constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_constant "Gravitational constant"), _G_, and the [solar mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_mass "Solar mass"), M☉. Neither _G_ nor M☉ can be measured to high accuracy separately, but the value of their product is known very precisely from observing the relative positions of planets ([Kepler's third law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_third_law "Kepler's third law") expressed in terms of Newtonian gravitation). Only the product is required to calculate planetary positions for an ephemeris, so ephemerides are calculated in astronomical units and not in SI units.

The calculation of ephemerides also requires a consideration of the effects of [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity"). In particular, time intervals measured on Earth's surface ([Terrestrial Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrestrial_Time "Terrestrial Time"), TT) are not constant when compared with the motions of the planets: the terrestrial second (TT) appears to be longer near January and shorter near July when compared with the "planetary second" (conventionally measured in TDB). This is because the distance between Earth and the Sun is not fixed (it varies between 0.983 289 8912 and 1.016 710 3335 au) and, when Earth is closer to the Sun ([perihelion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perihelion "Perihelion")), the Sun's gravitational field is stronger and Earth is moving faster along its orbital path. As the metre is defined in terms of the second and the speed of light is constant for all observers, the terrestrial metre appears to change in length compared with the "planetary metre" on a periodic basis.

The metre is defined to be a unit of [proper length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_length "Proper length"). Indeed, the [International Committee for Weights and Measures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Committee_for_Weights_and_Measures "International Committee for Weights and Measures") (CIPM) notes that "its definition applies only within a spatial extent sufficiently small that the effects of the non-uniformity of the gravitational field can be ignored".[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit#cite_note-25) As such, a distance within the Solar System without specifying the [frame of reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_of_reference "Frame of reference") for the measurement is problematic. The 1976 definition of the astronomical unit was incomplete because it did not specify the frame of reference in which to apply the measurement, but proved practical for the calculation of ephemerides: a fuller definition that is consistent with general relativity was proposed,[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit#cite_note-Huang-26) and "vigorous debate" ensued[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit#cite_note-Dodd-27) until August 2012 when the IAU adopted the current definition of 1 astronomical unit = 149 597 870 700[metres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre "Metre").

The astronomical unit is typically used for [stellar system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_system "Stellar system") scale distances, such as the size of a protostellar disk or the [heliocentric distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Heliocentric_distance&action=edit&redlink=1 "Heliocentric distance (page does not exist)") of an asteroid, whereas other units are used for [other distances in astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_distance_ladder "Cosmic distance ladder"). The astronomical unit is too small to be convenient for interstellar distances, where the [parsec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec "Parsec") and [light-year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-year "Light-year") are widely used. The parsec (parallax [arcsecond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute_and_second_of_arc "Minute and second of arc")) is defined in terms of the astronomical unit, being the distance of an object with a parallax of 1″. The light-year is often used in popular works, but is not an approved non-SI unit and is rarely used by professional astronomers.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit#cite_note-Dodd1-28)

When simulating a [numerical model of the Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_model_of_the_Solar_System "Numerical model of the Solar System"), the astronomical unit provides an appropriate scale that minimizes ([overflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_overflow "Arithmetic overflow"), [underflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_underflow "Arithmetic underflow") and [truncation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truncation "Truncation")) errors in [floating point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_point "Floating point") calculations.

Many early measurements of the Earth-Sun distance are wildly incorrect, primarily because the measurements rely on the ratio of the size of the Earth to the distance of the Sun. Since this ratio is 1/12000, small errors in the size of the Earth lead to large errors in the Earth-Sun distance.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit#cite_note-Hughes-2001-29)

Around 280 BC, [Aristarchus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristarchus_of_Samos "Aristarchus of Samos") carefully measured the Moon-Earth-Sun angle when the Moon is in its first [quarter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_phase "Lunar phase") and used this to estimate the distance to the Sun. The exact timing and angle measurement are essential.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit#cite_note-Hughes-2001-29) He estimated the angle at as 87° (the true value being close to 89.853°) and reported in _[On the Sizes and Distances of the Sun and Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On\_the\_Sizes\_and\_Distances\_(Aristarchus) "On the Sizes and Distances (Aristarchus)")_ the distance to the Sun is 18 to 20 times the [distance to the Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_distance_(astronomy) "Lunar distance (astronomy)"), whereas the true ratio is about 389.174. Depending on the distance that Aristarchus used for the distance to the Moon, his calculated distance to the Sun would fall between 380 and 1520 Earth radii.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit#cite_note-30)

[Hipparchus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hipparchus "Hipparchus") gave an estimate of the distance of Earth from the Sun, quoted by [Pappus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pappus_of_Alexandria "Pappus of Alexandria") as equal to 490 Earth radii. According to the conjectural reconstructions of [Noel Swerdlow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noel_Swerdlow "Noel Swerdlow") and [G. J. Toomer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._J._Toomer "G. J. Toomer"), this was derived from his assumption of a "least perceptible" solar parallax of 7[′](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute_of_arc "Minute of arc").[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit#cite_note-31)

A Chinese mathematical treatise, the _[Zhoubi Suanjing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhoubi\_Suanjing "Zhoubi Suanjing")_ (c. 1st century BCE), shows how the distance to the Sun can be computed geometrically, using the different lengths of the noontime shadows observed at three places 1000[_li_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_(unit) "Li (unit)") apart and the assumption that Earth is flat.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit#cite_note-32)

In the 2nd century CE, [Ptolemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy "Ptolemy") estimated the mean distance of the Sun as 1210 times [Earth's radius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_radius "Earth's radius").[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit#cite_note-34)[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit#cite_note-35) To determine this value, Ptolemy started by measuring the Moon's parallax, finding what amounted to a horizontal lunar parallax of 1°26′, which was much too large. He then derived a maximum lunar distance of ⁠64+1/6⁠ Earth radii. Because of cancelling errors in his parallax figure, his theory of the Moon's orbit, and other factors, this figure was approximately correct.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit#cite_note-vh1619-36)[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit#cite_note-37) He then measured the apparent sizes of the Sun and the Moon and concluded that the apparent diameter of the Sun was equal to the apparent diameter of the Moon at the Moon's greatest distance, and from records of lunar eclipses, he estimated this apparent diameter, as well as the apparent diameter of the shadow cone of Earth traversed by the Moon during a lunar eclipse. Given these data, the distance of the Sun from Earth can be trigonometrically computed to be 1210 Earth radii. This gives a ratio of solar to lunar distance of approximately 19, matching Aristarchus's figure. Although Ptolemy's procedure is theoretically workable, it is very sensitive to small changes in the data, so much so that changing a measurement by a few per cent can make the solar distance infinite.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit#cite_note-vh1619-36)

After Greek astronomy was transmitted to the medieval Islamic world, astronomers made some changes to Ptolemy's cosmological model, but did not greatly change his estimate of the Earth–Sun distance. For example, in his introduction to Ptolemaic astronomy, [al-Farghānī](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmad_ibn_Muhammad_ibn_Kathir_al-Farghani "Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Kathir al-Farghani") gave a mean solar distance of 1170 Earth radii, whereas in his _[zij](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zij "Zij")_, [al-Battānī](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Battani "Al-Battani") used a mean solar distance of 1108 Earth radii. Subsequent astronomers, such as [al-Bīrūnī](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Biruni "Al-Biruni"), used similar values.[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit#cite_note-38) Later in Europe, [Copernicus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Copernicus "Nicolaus Copernicus") and [Tycho Brahe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tycho_Brahe "Tycho Brahe") also used comparable figures (1142 and 1150 Earth radii), and so Ptolemy's approximate Earth–Sun distance survived through the 16th century.[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit#cite_note-39)

By the 17th century the problems with the measurement techniques came to be understood.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit#cite_note-Hughes-2001-29): 19 [Johannes Kepler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Kepler "Johannes Kepler") was the first to realize that Ptolemy's estimate must be significantly too low (according to Kepler, at least by a factor of three) in his _[Rudolphine Tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolphine\_Tables "Rudolphine Tables")_ (1627). [Kepler's laws of planetary motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_laws_of_planetary_motion "Kepler's laws of planetary motion") allowed astronomers to calculate the relative distances of the planets from the Sun, and rekindled interest in measuring the absolute value for Earth (which could then be applied to the other planets). The invention of the [telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telescope "Telescope") allowed far more accurate measurements of angles than is possible with the naked eye. Flemish astronomer [Godefroy Wendelin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godefroy_Wendelin "Godefroy Wendelin") repeated Aristarchus’ measurements in 1635, and found that Ptolemy's value was too low by a factor of at least eleven.

A somewhat more accurate estimate can be obtained by observing the [transit of Venus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transit_of_Venus "Transit of Venus").[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit#cite_note-Bell-40) By measuring the transit in two different locations, one can accurately calculate the parallax of Venus and from the relative distance of Earth and Venus from the Sun, the [solar parallax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax#Solar_parallax "Parallax")α (which cannot be measured directly due to the brightness of the Sun[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit#cite_note-Weaver-41)). [Jeremiah Horrocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremiah_Horrocks "Jeremiah Horrocks") had attempted to produce an estimate based on his observation of the [1639 transit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1639_transit_of_Venus "1639 transit of Venus") (published in 1662), giving a solar parallax of 15[″](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_of_arc "Second of arc"), similar to Wendelin's figure. The solar parallax is related to the Earth–Sun distance as measured in Earth radii by

![Image 2: {\displaystyle A=\cot \alpha \approx 1\,{\textrm {radian}}/\alpha .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a5a28d58487e8392b495c0ba9b95e122133961ba)
The smaller the solar parallax, the greater the distance between the Sun and Earth: a solar parallax of 15″ is equivalent to an Earth–Sun distance of 13 750 Earth radii.

[Christiaan Huygens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christiaan_Huygens "Christiaan Huygens") believed that the distance was even greater: by comparing the apparent sizes of Venus and [Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars "Mars"), he estimated a value of about 24 000 Earth radii,[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit#cite_note-Goldstein1-33) equivalent to a solar parallax of 8.6″. Although Huygens' estimate is remarkably close to modern values, it is often discounted by historians of astronomy because of the many unproven (and incorrect) assumptions he had to make for his method to work; the accuracy of his value seems to be based more on luck than good measurement, with his various errors cancelling each other out.

[![Image 3](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/Venustransit_2004-06-08_07-44.jpg/250px-Venustransit_2004-06-08_07-44.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Venustransit_2004-06-08_07-44.jpg)

Transits of Venus across the face of the Sun were, for a long time, the best method of measuring the astronomical unit, despite the difficulties (here, the so-called "[black drop effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_drop_effect "Black drop effect")") and the rarity of observations.

[Jean Richer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Richer "Jean Richer") and [Giovanni Domenico Cassini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Domenico_Cassini "Giovanni Domenico Cassini") measured the parallax of Mars between Paris and [Cayenne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayenne "Cayenne") in [French Guiana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Guiana "French Guiana") when Mars was at its closest to Earth in 1672. They arrived at a figure for the solar parallax of 9.5″, equivalent to an Earth–Sun distance of about 22 000 Earth radii. They were also the first astronomers to have access to an accurate and reliable value for the radius of Earth, which had been measured by their colleague [Jean Picard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Picard "Jean Picard") in 1669 as 3 269 000 _[toises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toise "Toise")_. This same year saw another estimate for the astronomical unit by [John Flamsteed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Flamsteed "John Flamsteed"), which accomplished it alone by measuring the [martian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars "Mars")[diurnal parallax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diurnal_parallax "Diurnal parallax").[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit#cite_note-42) Another colleague, [Ole Rømer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ole_R%C3%B8mer "Ole Rømer"), discovered the finite speed of light in 1676: the speed was so great that it was usually quoted as the time required for light to travel from the Sun to the Earth, or "light time per unit distance", a convention that is still followed by astronomers today.

A better method for observing Venus transits was devised by [James Gregory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Gregory_(astronomer_and_mathematician) "James Gregory (astronomer and mathematician)") and published in his _[Optica Promata](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Optica\_Promata&action=edit&redlink=1 "Optica Promata (page does not exist)")_ (1663). It was strongly advocated by [Edmond Halley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmond_Halley "Edmond Halley")[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit#cite_note-43) and was applied to the transits of Venus observed in 1761 and 1769, and then again in 1874 and 1882. Transits of Venus occur in pairs, but less than one pair every century, and observing the transits in 1761 and 1769 was an unprecedented international scientific operation including observations by James Cook and Charles Green from Tahiti. Despite the [Seven Years' War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Years%27_War "Seven Years' War"), dozens of astronomers were dispatched to observing points around the world at great expense and personal danger: several of them died in the endeavour.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit#cite_note-44) The various results were collated by [Jérôme Lalande](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%A9r%C3%B4me_Lalande "Jérôme Lalande") to give a figure for the solar parallax of 8.6″. [Karl Rudolph Powalky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Rudolph_Powalky "Karl Rudolph Powalky") had made an estimate of 8.83″ in 1864.[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit#cite_note-45)

| Date | Method | _A_/Gm | Uncertainty |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1895 | aberration | 149.25 | 0.12 |
| 1941 | parallax | 149.674 | 0.016 |
| 1964 | radar | 149.5981 | 0.001 |
| 1976 | telemetry | 149.597 870 | 0.000 001 |
| 2009 | telemetry | 149.597 870 700 | 0.000 000 003 |

Another method involved determining the constant of [aberration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aberration_of_light "Aberration of light"). [Simon Newcomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Newcomb "Simon Newcomb") gave great weight to this method when deriving his widely accepted value of 8.80″ for the solar parallax (close to the modern value of 8.794 143″), although Newcomb also used data from the transits of Venus. Newcomb also collaborated with [A. A. Michelson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._A._Michelson "A. A. Michelson") to measure the speed of light with Earth-based equipment; combined with the constant of aberration (which is related to the light time per unit distance), this gave the first direct measurement of the Earth–Sun distance in metres. Newcomb's value for the solar parallax (and for the constant of aberration and the Gaussian gravitational constant) were incorporated into the first international system of [astronomical constants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_constant "Astronomical constant") in 1896,[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit#cite_note-46) which remained in place for the calculation of ephemerides until 1964.[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit#cite_note-47) The name "astronomical unit" appears first to have been used in 1903.[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit#cite_note-48)[_[failed verification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability "Wikipedia:Verifiability")_]

The discovery of the [near-Earth asteroid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-Earth_asteroid "Near-Earth asteroid")[433 Eros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/433_Eros "433 Eros") and its passage near Earth in 1900–1901 allowed a considerable improvement in parallax measurement.[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit#cite_note-49) Another international project to measure the parallax of 433 Eros was undertaken in 1930–1931.[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit#cite_note-Weaver-41)[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit#cite_note-50)

Direct radar measurements of the distances to Venus and Mars became available in the early 1960s. Along with improved measurements of the speed of light, these showed that Newcomb's values for the solar parallax and the constant of aberration were inconsistent with one another.[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit#cite_note-51)

[![Image 4](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Stellarparallax_parsec1.svg/250px-Stellarparallax_parsec1.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Stellarparallax_parsec1.svg)

The _astronomical unit_ is used as the baseline of the triangle to measure [stellar parallaxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_parallax "Stellar parallax") (distances in the image are not to scale)

The unit distance A (the value of the astronomical unit in metres) can be expressed in terms of other astronomical constants:

![Image 5: {\displaystyle A^{3}={\frac {GM_{\odot }D^{2}}{k^{2}}},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/afa4c78a58c2b935ab0b121a93cceb9c88dcb38a)
where G is the [Newtonian constant of gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newtonian_constant_of_gravitation "Newtonian constant of gravitation"), M☉ is the solar mass, k is the numerical value of Gaussian gravitational constant and D is the time period of one day.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit#cite_note-IAUresB2-1) The Sun is constantly losing mass by radiating away energy,[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit#cite_note-52) so the orbits of the planets are steadily expanding outward from the Sun. This has led to calls to abandon the astronomical unit as a unit of measurement.[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit#cite_note-53)

As the speed of light has an exact defined value in SI units and the Gaussian gravitational constant k is fixed in the [astronomical system of units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_system_of_units "Astronomical system of units"), measuring the light time per unit distance is exactly equivalent to measuring the product G×M☉ in SI units. Hence, it is possible to construct ephemerides entirely in SI units, which is increasingly becoming the norm.

A 2004 analysis of radiometric measurements in the inner Solar System suggested that the [secular increase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secular_variation "Secular variation") in the unit distance was much larger than can be accounted for by solar radiation, +15±4 metres per century.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit#cite_note-54)[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit#cite_note-Anderson-55)

The measurements of the secular variations of the astronomical unit are not confirmed by other authors and are quite controversial. Furthermore, since 2010, the astronomical unit has not been estimated by the planetary ephemerides.[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit#cite_note-56)
