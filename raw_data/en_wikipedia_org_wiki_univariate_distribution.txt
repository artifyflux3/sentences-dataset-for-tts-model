This is in contrast to a multivariate distribution , the probability distribution of a random vector (consisting of multiple random variables).

Examples [ edit ] Continuous uniform distribution One of the simplest examples of a discrete univariate distribution is the discrete uniform distribution , where all elements of a finite set are equally likely. It is the probability model for the outcomes of tossing a fair coin, rolling a fair die, etc.  The univariate continuous uniform distribution on an interval [ a , b ] has the property that all sub-intervals of the same length are equally likely.

Binomial distribution with normal approximation for n = 6 and p = 0.5 Other examples of discrete univariate distributions include the binomial , geometric , negative binomial , and Poisson distributions .

[ 1 ] At least 750 univariate discrete distributions have been reported in the literature.

[ 2 ] Examples of commonly applied continuous univariate distributions [ 3 ] include the normal distribution , Student's t distribution , chisquare distribution , F distribution , exponential and gamma distributions.
