It is also known as the double commutant or second commutant and is written S ′ ′ ′ ′ {\displaystyle S^{\prime \prime }} .

The bicommutant is particularly useful in operator theory , due to the von Neumann double commutant theorem , which relates the algebraic and analytic structures of operator algebras . Specifically, it shows that if M is a unital, self-adjoint operator algebra in the C*-algebra B(H) , for some Hilbert space H , then the weak closure , strong closure and bicommutant of M are equal. This tells us that a unital C*-subalgebra M of B(H) is a von Neumann algebra if, and only if, M = M ′ ′ ′ ′ {\displaystyle M=M^{\prime \prime }} , and that if not, the von Neumann algebra it generates is M ′ ′ ′ ′ {\displaystyle M^{\prime \prime }} .

The bicommutant of S always contains S . So S ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ = ( S ′ ′ ′ ′ ) ′ ′ ⊆ ⊆ S ′ ′ {\displaystyle S^{\prime \prime \prime }=\left(S^{\prime \prime }\right)^{\prime }\subseteq S^{\prime }} . On the other hand, S ′ ′ ⊆ ⊆ ( S ′ ′ ) ′ ′ ′ ′ = S ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ {\displaystyle S^{\prime }\subseteq \left(S^{\prime }\right)^{\prime \prime }=S^{\prime \prime \prime }} . So S ′ ′ = S ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ {\displaystyle S^{\prime }=S^{\prime \prime \prime }} , i.e. the commutant of the bicommutant of S is equal to the commutant of S . By induction, we have: S ′ ′ = S ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ = S ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ = ⋯ ⋯ = S 2 n − − 1 = ⋯ ⋯ {\displaystyle S^{\prime }=S^{\prime \prime \prime }=S^{\prime \prime \prime \prime \prime }=\cdots =S^{2n-1}=\cdots } and S ⊆ ⊆ S ′ ′ ′ ′ = S ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ = S ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ = ⋯ ⋯ = S 2 n = ⋯ ⋯ {\displaystyle S\subseteq S^{\prime \prime }=S^{\prime \prime \prime \prime }=S^{\prime \prime \prime \prime \prime \prime }=\cdots =S^{2n}=\cdots } for n > 1.

It is clear that, if S 1 and S 2 are subsets of a semigroup, ( S 1 ∪ ∪ S 2 ) ′ = S 1 ′ ∩ ∩ S 2 ′ .

{\displaystyle \left(S_{1}\cup S_{2}\right)'=S_{1}'\cap S_{2}'.} If it is assumed that S 1 = S 1 ″ {\displaystyle S_{1}=S_{1}''\,} and S 2 = S 2 ″ {\displaystyle S_{2}=S_{2}''\,} (this is the case, for instance, for von Neumann algebras ), then the above equality gives ( S 1 ′ ∪ ∪ S 2 ′ ) ″ = ( S 1 ″ ∩ ∩ S 2 ″ ) ′ = ( S 1 ∩ ∩ S 2 ) ′ .

{\displaystyle \left(S_{1}'\cup S_{2}'\right)''=\left(S_{1}''\cap S_{2}''\right)'=\left(S_{1}\cap S_{2}\right)'.} See also [ edit ] von Neumann double commutant theorem References [ edit ] J. Dixmier, Von Neumann Algebras , North-Holland, Amsterdam, 1981.
