H. von Wright in 1961 Georg Henrik von Wright ( Swedish: [ˈjěːɔrj ˈhɛ̌nːrɪk fɔn ˈvrɪkːt] ; [ a ] 14 June 1916 – 16 June 2003) was a Finnish philosopher .

Biography [ edit ] G. H. von Wright [ 3 ] was born in Helsinki on 14 June 1916 to Tor von Wright and his wife Ragni Elisabeth Alfthan.

[ 4 ] On the retirement of Ludwig Wittgenstein as professor at the University of Cambridge in 1948, von Wright succeeded him.

[ 4 ] He published in English , Finnish , German , and Swedish , belonging to the Swedish-speaking minority of Finland. Von Wright was of both Finnish and 17th-century Scottish ancestry, [ 5 ] and the family was raised to nobility in 1772.

[ 6 ] In later years von Wright began to take an interest in political questions, having opposed the heavy bombing ordered by Lyndon B. Johnson during the Vietnam War . He attended the Praxis School -organised Korčula Summer School .

[ 7 ] Work [ edit ] Von Wright's writings come under two broad categories . The first is analytic philosophy and philosophical logic in the Anglo-American vein. His 1951 texts An Essay in Modal Logic and " Deontic Logic " were landmarks in the postwar rise of formal modal logic and its deontic version. He was an authority on Wittgenstein, editing his later works. He was the leading figure in the Finnish philosophy of his time, specialising in philosophical logic , philosophical analysis , philosophy of action , philosophy of language , epistemology , and the close study of Charles Sanders Peirce .

The other vein in von Wright's writings is moralist and pessimist . During the last twenty years of his life, under the influence of Oswald Spengler , Jürgen Habermas and the Frankfurt School 's reflections about modern rationality , he wrote prolifically. His best known article from this period is entitled "The Myth of Progress " (1993), and it questions whether our apparent material and technological progress can really be considered " progress " (see Myth of Progress ).

Awards [ edit ] In the last year of his life, he was awarded several honorary degrees , including one by the University of Bergen .

[ 8 ] He also was awarded the Swedish Academy Finland Prize in 1968.

[ 14 ] Notes [ edit ] ^ His obituarist in The Times claims that von Wright "used to tell British friends that the anglophone pronunciation was correct, since the name derived from a Scotsman" i.e. as rhyming with "bright" not “tricked.” [ 1 ] The Institute for the Languages of Finland does however promote the rendering of the von Wright surname as "fånvrikt".

^ An explanation of the von Wright name is given in "Georg Henrik von Wright: Intellectual Autobiography" (in: Schilpp, 1989): "Around the year 1650, the earliest known members of my family had to leave Scotland because, it is said, they had sided with King Charles against Cromwell. They settled in Narva in Estonia, which was then a province under Swedish rule.

Georg(e) Wright there begat Henrik Wright , who fought in the armies of Charles XII and after a long and eventful life died in his home in Finland, another part of the old Swedish realm. Henrik Wright's son Georg Henrik was, together with his three other sons, raised to noble rank after the royal coup d'etat of 1772. This was how the odd combination of 'von' and 'Wright' originated." ^ a b Hacker, P. M. S.
