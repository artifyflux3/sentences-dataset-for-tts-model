Finland borders Sweden to the west, Russia to the east, and Norway to the north, while Estonia lies to its south across the Gulf of Finland , allowing an ecological mix. Finland contains many species of mammals, birds, and fish, but only a few reptiles and amphibians. This article discusses all the vertebrate animals which can be found on Finland itself, not the oceans.

Mammals [ edit ] Main article: List of mammals of Finland There are over 90 species of mammals found in Finland and the surrounding oceans. Some were introduced from other countries in Europe, as well as other continents, such as Asia and North America. Rodents and shrews are most common in Finland.

Rodents [ edit ] There are close to 30 species of rodents living throughout Finland. These include the widespread Muridae , such as the house mouse, brown rat and wood mouse which live throughout Europe, and the Norway lemming, which only lives in Scandinavia . Some were introduced there, and they include the muskrat and nutria among others.

European rabbit , Oryctolagus cuniculus (common/spread from central Europe) Brown hare , Lepus europaeus (common) Mountain hare , Lepus timidus (common) Insectivores [ edit ] There are 10 species of insectivore living in Finland.

Four pinnipeds are native to Finland year round (most living on the northern coast), but other species, such as the walrus, may migrate there during certain times of the year. The Saimaa ringed seal is a subspecies of ringed seal native exclusively to Finland and is a famous animal there, though it is also one of the most endangered seal subspecies in the world.

However, the population of harbour porpoise in the Baltic Sea has dropped dramatically since the mid-1950s and is now at under 500. The top current threats for Baltic harbour porpoise are bycatch in fisheries, environmental toxins mostly from the Swedish paper industry and anthropogenic noise.
