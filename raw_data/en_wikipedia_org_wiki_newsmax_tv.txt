It was launched to provide independent news; its founder, Chris Ruddy described it as intended to be a "kinder, gentler Fox News," saying that "Our goal is to be a little more boomer -oriented, more information-based rather than being vituperative and polarizing." [ 25 ] Around the time of the channel launch, Businessweek Bloomberg profiled Ruddy and Newsmax in a feature story entitled "The Next Ailes : Newsmax's Chris Ruddy Preps TV Rival to Fox News.

[ 26 ] Businessweek Bloomberg reported that Newsmax planned to build off its success as a digital media player to challenge Fox News in the traditional cable arena while developing a stake in the emerging streaming OTT business.

A Fast Company report in December 2020 suggested Newsmax was on a course to "dethrone" Fox with its streaming digital strategy by offering the channel for free to platforms like Roku, YouTube, Pluto TV, Xumo, Samsung TV Plus and others. "You wouldn't know it by looking at cable TV ratings, but Fox News has a problem on its hands," Fast Company wrote, noting that "When you factor in Newsmax's streaming audience, the race between the two right-wing news networks is closer than you might think." [ 27 ] On January 16, 2016, Dennis Michael Lynch : Unfiltered debuted on the channel.

[ citation needed ] The program ended after the first segment of the August 10, 2016, episode after Lynch announced that he would resign from the network and made comments defending Fox News Channel and criticizing his network for its reporting of the Trump campaign and suggesting they were restricting his editorial control; he was escorted out from the network's New York studio during what would have been the first commercial break.

[ 28 ] [ 29 ] It was replaced the next Monday with an hour-long video simulcast of radio's The Howie Carr Show from WRKO in Boston .

[ 30 ] Beginning in 2020, the network significantly ramped up programming, adding evening shows with Greg Kelly, a former Fox News and local affiliate host, and Grant Stinchfield, a former NBC local correspondent and ex-NRA TV host.

[ 31 ] The network launched Spicer & Co.

on March 3, 2020, featuring former Trump White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer and co-host Lyndsay Keith , [ 32 ] [ 33 ] Historically, the network started out with a documentary-heavy lineup, but as of 2022, replays of daily and weekend shows make up the bulk of the network's late night programming, like most news channels.

2020 election [ edit ] During the 2020 United States presidential election , then-President Trump began to promote Newsmax over rival competitor Fox News .

[ 21 ] [ 34 ] [ 35 ] Trump's preference for Newsmax over Fox News became clearer after the latter became the first news outlet to call Arizona for Democratic challenger Joe Biden .

[ 36 ] Newsmax has made their more conservative leanings a selling point to disaffected Fox News viewers, as well as employing Fox News alumni to join their lineup on Newsmax TV, such as Rob Schmitt and Greg Kelly .

[ 36 ] [ 37 ] [ 38 ] After the election was won by Democrat Joe Biden , Newsmax struck a defiant tone, focusing on conspiracy theories and allegations of voter fraud as a way to attract Fox News viewers angered by what they saw as insufficient loyalty to Trump.

[ 39 ] [ 40 ] [ 41 ] Emily VanDerWerff of Vox reported that the outlet did not "go full arch-conservative" and "doesn't give airtime to QAnon paranoiacs", but that it "spent lots of time arguing that other media outlets jumped the gun in calling the election for Biden and that Trump still has a path to win this thing." [ 42 ] Newsmax was thus positioned further to the right of Fox but less so than One America News Network , another conservative news channel that embraced a far-right editorial stance during and after the Trump administration.

[ 43 ] CNN's Brian Stelter , in an on-air interview, asked Newsmax CEO Christopher Ruddy why the network chose to air "election denialism" and "bogus voter fraud stuff," to which Ruddy replied that the network featured all points of view and argued that all of the other major news outlets who had reported Biden's election win were "rushing." [ 44 ] 2021–present [ edit ] Since the election, Newsmax has seen increasing viewership; according to Nielsen, Newsmax averaged 182,000 viewers in the week leading up to the election. In the week that followed, the average increased further with daily averages around 400,000 viewers, with Greg Kelly Reports and Spicer & Co.

having attracted numbers in the 700,000–800,000 range.

[ 45 ] On December 7, 2020, Greg Kelly Reports beat its timeslot competitor on Fox News, The Story with Martha MacCallum , in average key demographic viewership for the first time (229,000 to 203,000), while Stelter observed that overall the program "has nearly a million viewers on a good night".

[ 46 ] A small number of cable providers, including Breezeline (formerly Atlantic Broadband), dropped the channel in January 2022. The company stated that the decision was not based on the network's content, but because of Newsmax wanting to move to more traditional retransmission consent arrangements where providers pay to carry the network (rather than Newsmax paying providers to carry the channel), while simultaneously being available at no charge via YouTube and free ad-supported streaming television (FAST) platforms.

[ 43 ] Newsmax planned to discontinue its free online streams by the end of 2023.

[ 47 ] As of October 2022, Newsmax was in a distant fourth place among the cable news channels, behind Fox News, CNN and MSNBC but ahead of NewsNation .

[ 48 ] On January 25, 2023, Newsmax TV was removed from the satellite and streaming versions of DirecTV and U-verse after their carriage agreement expired; the network sought to convert from paying DirecTV for carriage to a retransmission consent arrangement.

[ 49 ] DirecTV subsequently replaced Newsmax TV with the competing conservative network The First TV .

[ 50 ] While DirecTV isn't required by law to carry cable news channels with differing political agendas, this particular carriage dispute invoked stroke rebukes from conservative lawmakers like Florida governor Ron DeSantis , who characterised the dispute as "censorship." [ 51 ] DirecTV and Newsmax settled their dispute on March 22, 2023.

[ 52 ] Newsmax's retransmission consent agreement with DirecTV and others required it to wind down the free streaming simulcast of its cable news channel, which it did on November 1, 2023. In its place on free ad-supported streaming television providers, Newsmax launched "Newsmax2," which includes headline rundowns and shorter 'best-of' clips of Newsmax programming. Newsmax+ was then launched as a paid monthly subscription service, carrying the traditional feed now exclusive to paid television providers.

Currently, only a county-owned translator network in Millard County, Utah , along with Alexandria, Minnesota 's Selective TV system continue to carry the main channel over-the-air.

The terms for DirecTV's new carriage deal for Newsmax TV required the network's remaining over-the-air affiliations and free online availability (outside some exceptions) to be withdrawn as of November 1, 2023, when that access ended and was replaced by a monthly subscription platform, Newsmax+, or TV Everywhere authentication with a paid television provider. Online providers and over-the-air stations began to carry a secondary channel, Newsmax2, featuring taped 'best-of' content with some simulcasting of the main channel's live schedule.

We first analyze Trump's tweets during his presidency (January 2017–January 2021) mentioning three far-right outlets (One America News Network, Newsmax, and Breitbart), conceptualizing these messages as authority signals that symbolically lend legitimacy to the media sources. [...] To capture appearances in our two video-based sources (OANN and Newsmax), we turned to their YouTube channels, as we were unable to find transcripts of their broadcasts for the entire Trump presidency.

Consistent with these scientific studies, a May 2021 survey by the Public Religion Research Institute found that consumption of far-right television sources Newsmax and One America News Network, followed by Fox News, was more highly associated with holding core beliefs of the QAnon conspiracy theorists than was true of people who did not rely on television news.
