[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Pre-metric units [ edit ] Before the introduction of the metric system, a number of modified Spanish (Castilian [ 2 ] ), English and local units were used, and continue to be used today by a large part of the country.

[ 1 ] Length [ edit ] A number of units were used to measure length. One vara was equal to 0.836 m.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Some other units are given below: [ 1 ] [ 2 ] 1 cuarta = 1 ⁄ 4 vara 1 tercia = 1 ⁄ 3 vara 1 mecate = 24 varas.

1 legua = 5,000 varas [ 3 ] Area [ edit ] The manzana was used by farmers to measure land area. For large areas, land was customarily measured in labors or legua.

[ 3 ] 1 manzana = 10,000 vara 2 =  1.727 acres = 6,989 m 2 ≈ .7 hectare [ a ] 1 labor = 1 million vara 2 1 legua [ b ] = 25 labors = 25 million vara 2 Mass [ edit ] Several units were used to measure mass in Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador. Some units are given below: [ 1 ] [ 2 ] 1 caja = 16 kg 1 quintal = 100 libras [ c ] ≈ 46 kg ≈ 101.4 lbs [ 3 ] 1 carga [ d ] = 2 quintals ≈ 200 lbs ≈ 90.72 kg [ 5 ] Volume [ edit ] Several units were used to measure capacity in Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador.

1 botella = 0.63 to 0.67 L.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] 1 cajuela = 16.6 L.

[ 1 ] 1 cuartillo varies between countries, [ 1 ] but defined as 4 octavillos or 1/4 almude and contains 1.156 L ≈ 1.222 qt(US) (liquid) ≈ 1.017 qt(Imp) [ 3 ] 1 fanega = 12 almudes = 48 cuartillos ≈ 55.50 L ≈ 1.960 ft 3 (1.575 U.S. bushels) [ 3 ] Notes [ edit ] ^ In calculations, the equivalence of 7000 m 2 or .7 hectare per manzana is often used to simplify conversion.

^ Legua denoting area is equal to 1 square legua denoting length. In Latin America and southwestern United States, this is 4428.4 acres, 6.919 square miles, 1792 hectares, or 17.92 square kilometers.

^ The Spanish libra is slightly larger than the English pound, generally in the range from 1.011 to 1.016 English pound. Both are derived from the Roman libra , hence the abbreviation lbs for English pounds.

^ In Honduras and El Salvador a sack of beans or coffee typically weighs one quintal. Two of these are loaded on a mule or horse to make one load, or carga in Spanish. The unit carga is cited for yuca and yams as approximately 90.72 kg.

[ 4 ] There are other Spanish and Portuguese speaking countries in which a carga is equal to 3 quintals or equal to a volume of 3 quintals of a commodity being shipped.
