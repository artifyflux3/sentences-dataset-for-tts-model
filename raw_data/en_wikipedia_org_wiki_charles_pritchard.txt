Charles Pritchard Born ( 1808-02-29 ) 29 February 1808 Alberbury, Shropshire , England Died 20 May 1893 (1893-05-20) (aged 85) Awards Royal Medal (1892) Scientific career Fields astronomy Reverend Charles Pritchard (29 February 1808 – 28 May 1893) was a British astronomer , clergyman, and educational reformer. He founded the Clapham Grammar School in 1834 and included sciences in the curriculum. A chapel was erected in 1846.

[ 1 ] Biography [ edit ] He was born at Alberbury, Shropshire , fourth son of William Pritchard, a failed manufacturer who later moved to London where he attended the Merchant Taylor's School and Poplar Academy where he was taught by John Stock , the progressive educationalist. Pritchard later described his studies as consisting of "a systematic course of instruction relating to physical phenomena".

[ 2 ] At sixteen he was enrolled as a sizar at St John's College, Cambridge , graduating in 1830 as fourth wrangler .

[ 3 ] In 1832 he was elected a fellow of his college, and in the following year he was ordained, and became head of a private school at Stockwell . From 1834 to 1862 he was headmaster of Clapham grammar school . He then retired to Freshwater , in the Isle of Wight , and took an active interest in the affairs of the Royal Astronomical Society , of which he became honorary secretary in 1862 and president in 1866.

[ 4 ] His sister, Margaret died this same year.

His career as a professional astronomer began in 1870, when he was elected Savilian professor of astronomy at the University of Oxford . At his request the university decided to build a fine equatorial telescope for the instruction of his class and for purposes of research, a scheme which, as a result of Warren de la Rue 's munificent gift of instruments from his private observatory at Cranford , expanded into the establishment of the new university observatory . By De la Rue's advice, Pritchard began his career there with a determination of the physical libration of the moon , or the nutation of its axis .

[ 5 ] In 1882 Pritchard commenced a systematic study of stellar photometry . For this purpose he employed an instrument known as the " wedge photometer ", with which he measured the relative brightness of 2,784 stars between the North Pole and about -10° declination . The results were published in 1885 in his Uranometria Nova Oxoniensis , and their importance was recognized by the bestowal in 1886 upon him, conjointly with Professor Pickering , of the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society .

[ 5 ] He then decided to experiment with applying photography to the determination of stellar parallax . With the object of testing the capabilities of the method, he took for his first essay the well-known star 61 Cygni , and his results agreed so well with those previously attained that he undertook the systematic measurement of the parallaxes of second-magnitude stars, and published the outcome in the third and fourth volumes of the Publications of the Oxford University Observatory . Although some lurking errors impaired the authority of the concluded parallaxes this work ranks as a valuable contribution to astronomy, since it showed the possibility of employing photography in such delicate investigations.

[ 5 ] When an international survey of the heavens was proposed, the zone between 25° and 31° north declination was allotted to him, and at the time of his death some progress had been made in recording its included stars. Pritchard became a fellow of New College, Oxford , in 1883, and an honorary fellow of St John's College, Cambridge , in 1886. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1840, and in 1892 was awarded one of the royal medals for his work on photometry and stellar parallax .

[ 5 ] Family [ edit ] A son, Sir Charles Bradley Pritchard , was an administrator in British India.
