In [Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry "Euclidean geometry"), **equipollence** is a [homogeneous relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_relation "Homogeneous relation") between [directed line segments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_line_segment "Directed line segment"). Two segments are said to be _**equipollent**_ when they have the same length and direction. Two equipollent segments are [parallel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_(geometry) "Parallel (geometry)") but not necessarily [colinear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colinear "Colinear") nor [overlapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_segment_intersection "Line segment intersection"). For example, a segment _AB_, from point _A_ to point _B_, has the [opposite direction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposite_direction_(geometry) "Opposite direction (geometry)") to segment _BA_; thus _AB_ and _BA_ are _not_ equipollent.

If the segments _AB_ and _CD_ are equipollent, then _AC_ and _BD_ are also equipollent

A property of [Euclidean spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space") is the parallelogram property of vectors: If two segments are equipollent, then they form two sides of a (possibly degenerate) [parallelogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallelogram "Parallelogram"):

> If a given vector holds between _a_ and _b_, _c_ and _d_, then the vector which holds between _a_ and _c_ is the same as that which holds between _b_ and _d_.

Symbol for equipollence

The concept of equipollent line segments was advanced by [Giusto Bellavitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giusto_Bellavitis "Giusto Bellavitis") in 1835. Subsequently, the term **vector** was adopted for a class of equipollent line segments. Bellavitis's use of the idea of a [relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relation_(mathematics) "Relation (mathematics)") to compare different but similar objects has become a common mathematical technique, particularly in the use of [equivalence relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_relation "Equivalence relation"). Bellavitis used a special notation for the equipollence of segments _AB_ and _CD_:

![Image 3: {\displaystyle AB\bumpeq CD.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/448bdaee25d9014452928f94ad10b6ec3cd8da9f)
The following passages, translated by [Michael J. Crowe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_J._Crowe "Michael J. Crowe"), show the anticipation that Bellavitis had of [vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector "Euclidean vector") concepts:

Equipollences continue to hold when one substitutes for the lines in them, other lines which are respectively equipollent to them, however they may be situated in space. From this it can be understood how any number and any kind of lines may be _summed_, and that in whatever order these lines are taken, the same equipollent-sum will be obtained...In equipollences, just as in equations, a line may be transferred from one side to the other, provided that the sign is changed...
Thus oppositely directed segments are negatives of each other: ![Image 4: {\displaystyle AB+BA\bumpeq 0.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b7120de361160261790b568f8f0da27edfe7fe5f)

The equipollence ![Image 5: {\displaystyle AB\bumpeq n.CD,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4c1c1f3e5a61b66497796125b6fa768f2cad6a24) where _n_ stands for a positive number, indicates that _AB_ is both parallel to and has the same direction as _CD_, and that their lengths have the relation expressed by _AB_ = _n.CD_.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equipollent_(geometry)#cite_note-1)
The segment from _A_ to _B_ is a _bound vector_, while the class of segments equipollent to it is a [free vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_vector "Free vector"), in the parlance of [Euclidean vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector "Euclidean vector").

Geometric equipollence is also used on the sphere:

To appreciate [Hamilton's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._R._Hamilton "W. R. Hamilton") method, let us first recall the much simpler case of the Abelian group of translations in Euclidean three-dimensional space. Each translation is representable as a vector in space, only the direction and magnitude being significant, and the location irrelevant. The composition of two translations is given by the head-to-tail parallelogram rule of vector addition; and taking the inverse amounts to reversing direction. In Hamilton's theory of turns, we have a generalization of such a picture from the Abelian translation group to the non-Abelian [SU(2)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SU(2) "SU(2)"). Instead of vectors in space, we deal with directed great circle arcs, of length < π on a unit sphere S 2 in a Euclidean three-dimensional space. Two such arcs are deemed equivalent if by sliding one along its great circle it can be made to coincide with the other.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equipollent_(geometry)#cite_note-2)
On a [great circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_circle "Great circle") of a sphere, two directed [circular arcs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_arc "Circular arc") are equipollent when they agree in direction and arc length. An equivalence class of such arcs is associated with a [quaternion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion "Quaternion")[versor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Versor "Versor")

![Image 6: {\displaystyle \exp(ar)=\cos a+r\sin a,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/84cac7a285bc7175c9f787349f905d9af5894052) where _a_ is arc length and _r_ determines the plane of the great circle by perpendicularity.
Properties of the equivalence classes of equipollent segments can be abstracted to define [affine space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_space "Affine space"):

If _A_ is a set of points and _V_ is a [vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space"), then (_A, V_) is an **affine space** provided that for any two points _a,b_ in _A_ there is a vector ![Image 7: {\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {ab}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6d9f5228fc1782efa416fdce3110c0200ef7bcc3) in _V_, and for any _a_ in _A_ and _v_ in _V_ there is _b_ in _A_ such that ![Image 8: {\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {ab}}=v,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/51d063d8a8a6663fee3fdfa477b2c85e7b9416ff) and for any three points in _A_ there is the vector equation

![Image 9: {\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {ab}}+{\overrightarrow {bc}}={\overrightarrow {ac}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/908ac777a99f253da6bdf37dd618eff10c1db513)
Evidently this development depends on previous introduction to abstract vector spaces, in contrast to the introduction of vectors via equivalence classes of directed segments.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equipollent_(geometry)#cite_note-3)
