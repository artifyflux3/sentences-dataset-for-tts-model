[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] He authored Gaṇita-sāra-saṅgraha ( Ganita Sara Sangraha ) or the Compendium on the gist of Mathematics in 850 CE.

[ 4 ] He was patronised by the Rashtrakuta emperor Amoghavarsha .

[ 4 ] He separated astrology from mathematics. It is the earliest Indian text entirely devoted to mathematics.

[ 5 ] He expounded on the same subjects on which Aryabhata and Brahmagupta contended, but he expressed them more clearly. His work is a highly syncopated approach to algebra and the emphasis in much of his text is on developing the techniques necessary to solve algebraic problems.

[ 6 ] He is highly respected among Indian mathematicians, because of his establishment of terminology for concepts such as equilateral, and isosceles triangle; rhombus; circle and semicircle.

[ 7 ] Mahāvīra's eminence spread throughout southern India and his books proved inspirational to other mathematicians in Southern India .

[ 8 ] It was translated into the Telugu language by Pavuluri Mallana as Saara Sangraha Ganitamu .

[ 9 ] He discovered algebraic identities like a 3 = a ( a + b ) ( a − b ) + b 2 ( a − b ) + b 3 .

[ 3 ] He also found out the formula for n C r as [ n ( n − 1) ( n − 2) ... ( n − r + 1)] / [ r ( r − 1) ( r − 2) ... 2 * 1].

[ 10 ] He devised a formula which approximated the area and perimeters of ellipses and found methods to calculate the square of a number and cube roots of a number.

[ 11 ] He asserted that the square root of a negative number does not exist.

[ 12 ] Arithmetic operations utilized in his works like Gaṇita-sāra-saṅgraha(Ganita Sara Sangraha) uses decimal place-value system and include the use of zero . However, he erroneously states that a number divided by zero remains unchanged.

[ 13 ] Rules for decomposing fractions [ edit ] Mahāvīra's Gaṇita-sāra-saṅgraha gave systematic rules for expressing a fraction as the sum of unit fractions .

[ 14 ] This follows the use of unit fractions in Indian mathematics in the Vedic period, and the Śulba Sūtras ' giving an approximation of √ 2 equivalent to 1 + 1 3 + 1 3 ⋅ ⋅ 4 − − 1 3 ⋅ ⋅ 4 ⋅ ⋅ 34 {\displaystyle 1+{\tfrac {1}{3}}+{\tfrac {1}{3\cdot 4}}-{\tfrac {1}{3\cdot 4\cdot 34}}} .

[ 14 ] In the Gaṇita-sāra-saṅgraha (GSS), the second section of the chapter on arithmetic is named kalā-savarṇa-vyavahāra (lit. "the operation of the reduction of fractions"). In this, the bhāgajāti section (verses 55–98) gives rules for the following: [ 14 ] To express 1 as the sum of n unit fractions (GSS kalāsavarṇa 75, examples in 76): [ 14 ] rūpāṃśakarāśīnāṃ rūpādyās triguṇitā harāḥ kramaśaḥ / dvidvitryaṃśābhyastāv ādimacaramau phale rūpe // When the result is one, the denominators of the quantities having one as numerators are [the numbers] beginning with one and multiplied by three, in order. The first and the last are multiplied by two and two-thirds [respectively].

1 = 1 1 ⋅ ⋅ 2 + 1 3 + 1 3 2 + ⋯ ⋯ + 1 3 n − − 2 + 1 2 3 ⋅ ⋅ 3 n − − 1 {\displaystyle 1={\frac {1}{1\cdot 2}}+{\frac {1}{3}}+{\frac {1}{3^{2}}}+\dots +{\frac {1}{3^{n-2}}}+{\frac {1}{{\frac {2}{3}}\cdot 3^{n-1}}}} To express 1 as the sum of an odd number of unit fractions (GSS kalāsavarṇa 77): [ 14 ] 1 = 1 2 ⋅ ⋅ 3 ⋅ ⋅ 1 / 2 + 1 3 ⋅ ⋅ 4 ⋅ ⋅ 1 / 2 + ⋯ ⋯ + 1 ( 2 n − − 1 ) ⋅ ⋅ 2 n ⋅ ⋅ 1 / 2 + 1 2 n ⋅ ⋅ 1 / 2 {\displaystyle 1={\frac {1}{2\cdot 3\cdot 1/2}}+{\frac {1}{3\cdot 4\cdot 1/2}}+\dots +{\frac {1}{(2n-1)\cdot 2n\cdot 1/2}}+{\frac {1}{2n\cdot 1/2}}} To express a unit fraction 1 / q {\displaystyle 1/q} as the sum of n other fractions with given numerators a 1 , a 2 , … … , a n {\displaystyle a_{1},a_{2},\dots ,a_{n}} (GSS kalāsavarṇa 78, examples in 79): 1 q = a 1 q ( q + a 1 ) + a 2 ( q + a 1 ) ( q + a 1 + a 2 ) + ⋯ ⋯ + a n − − 1 ( q + a 1 + ⋯ ⋯ + a n − − 2 ) ( q + a 1 + ⋯ ⋯ + a n − − 1 ) + a n a n ( q + a 1 + ⋯ ⋯ + a n − − 1 ) {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{q}}={\frac {a_{1}}{q(q+a_{1})}}+{\frac {a_{2}}{(q+a_{1})(q+a_{1}+a_{2})}}+\dots +{\frac {a_{n-1}}{(q+a_{1}+\dots +a_{n-2})(q+a_{1}+\dots +a_{n-1})}}+{\frac {a_{n}}{a_{n}(q+a_{1}+\dots +a_{n-1})}}} To express any fraction p / q {\displaystyle p/q} as a sum of unit fractions (GSS kalāsavarṇa 80, examples in 81): [ 14 ] Choose an integer i such that q + i p {\displaystyle {\tfrac {q+i}{p}}} is an integer r , then write p q = 1 r + i r ⋅ ⋅ q {\displaystyle {\frac {p}{q}}={\frac {1}{r}}+{\frac {i}{r\cdot q}}} and repeat the process for the second term, recursively. (Note that if i is always chosen to be the smallest such integer, this is identical to the greedy algorithm for Egyptian fractions .) To express a unit fraction as the sum of two other unit fractions (GSS kalāsavarṇa 85, example in 86): [ 14 ] 1 n = 1 p ⋅ ⋅ n + 1 p ⋅ ⋅ n n − − 1 {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{n}}={\frac {1}{p\cdot n}}+{\frac {1}{\frac {p\cdot n}{n-1}}}} where p {\displaystyle p} is to be chosen such that p ⋅ ⋅ n n − − 1 {\displaystyle {\frac {p\cdot n}{n-1}}} is an integer (for which p {\displaystyle p} must be a multiple of n − − 1 {\displaystyle n-1} ).

1 a ⋅ ⋅ b = 1 a ( a + b ) + 1 b ( a + b ) {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{a\cdot b}}={\frac {1}{a(a+b)}}+{\frac {1}{b(a+b)}}} To express a fraction p / q {\displaystyle p/q} as the sum of two other fractions with given numerators a {\displaystyle a} and b {\displaystyle b} (GSS kalāsavarṇa 87, example in 88): [ 14 ] p q = a a i + b p ⋅ ⋅ q i + b a i + b p ⋅ ⋅ q i ⋅ ⋅ i {\displaystyle {\frac {p}{q}}={\frac {a}{{\frac {ai+b}{p}}\cdot {\frac {q}{i}}}}+{\frac {b}{{\frac {ai+b}{p}}\cdot {\frac {q}{i}}\cdot {i}}}} where i {\displaystyle i} is to be chosen such that p {\displaystyle p} divides a i + b {\displaystyle ai+b} Some further rules were given in the Gaṇita-kaumudi of Nārāyaṇa in the 14th century.
