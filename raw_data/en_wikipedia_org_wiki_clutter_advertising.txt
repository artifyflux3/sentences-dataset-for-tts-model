Background [ edit ] One explanation, in a general sense, is that advertising clutter is often a result of a marketplace that is (over)-crowded with competing products. Heightened competition from this phenomenon has led to the emergence of other advertising strategies, including guerrilla marketing , viral marketing , and experiential marketing along with new focuses on humanising messaging within marketing.

[ citation needed ] Online advertising clutter [ edit ] Studies have shown that annoyance factors from online advertising clutter is a significant contributor to advertising avoidance.
