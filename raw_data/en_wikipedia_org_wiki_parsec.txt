The **parsec** (symbol: **pc**) is a [unit of length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_of_length "Unit of length") used to measure the large distances to [astronomical objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_object "Astronomical object") outside the [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System "Solar System"), approximately equal to 3.26 [light-years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-year "Light-year") or 206,265 [astronomical units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit "Astronomical unit") (AU), i.e. 30.9[trillion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1000000000000_(number) "1000000000000 (number)")[kilometres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilometre "Kilometre") (19.2 trillion [miles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mile "Mile")).[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec#cite_note-trillion-1) The parsec unit is obtained by the use of [parallax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax "Parallax") and [trigonometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometry "Trigonometry"), and is defined as the distance at which 1 AU [subtends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtended_angle "Subtended angle") an angle of one [arcsecond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcsecond "Arcsecond")[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec#cite_note-2) (⁠1/3600⁠ of a [degree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle) "Degree (angle)")). The nearest star, [Proxima Centauri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxima_Centauri "Proxima Centauri"), is about 1.3 parsecs (4.2 light-years) from the [Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun "Sun"): from that distance, the gap between the Earth and the Sun spans slightly less than one arcsecond.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec#cite_note-3) Most [stars visible to the naked eye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked-eye_stars "Naked-eye stars") are within a few hundred parsecs of the Sun, with the most distant at a few thousand parsecs, and the [Andromeda Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy "Andromeda Galaxy") at over 700,000 parsecs.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec#cite_note-4)

The word _parsec_ is a shortened form of _a distance corresponding to a parallax of one second_, coined by the British astronomer [Herbert Hall Turner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Hall_Turner "Herbert Hall Turner") in 1913.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec#cite_note-dyson-5) The unit was introduced to simplify the calculation of astronomical distances from raw observational data. Partly for this reason, it is the unit preferred in [astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy "Astronomy") and [astrophysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics "Astrophysics"), though in [popular science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_science "Popular science") texts and common usage the [light-year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-year "Light-year") remains prominent. Although parsecs are used for the shorter distances within the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way "Milky Way"), multiples of parsecs are required for the larger scales in the universe, including [kilo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilo- "Kilo-")parsecs (kpc) for the more distant objects within and around the Milky Way, [mega](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega- "Mega-")parsecs (Mpc) for mid-distance galaxies, and [giga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giga- "Giga-")parsecs (Gpc) for many [quasars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasar "Quasar") and the most distant galaxies.

In August 2015, the [International Astronomical Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Astronomical_Union "International Astronomical Union") (IAU) passed Resolution B2 which, as part of the definition of a standardized absolute and apparent [bolometric magnitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolometric_magnitude "Bolometric magnitude") scale, mentioned an existing explicit definition of the parsec as exactly ⁠648 000/π⁠au, or approximately 30 856 775 814 913 673 metres, given the IAU 2012 exact definition of the astronomical unit in metres. This corresponds to the small-angle definition of the parsec found in many astronomical references.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec#cite_note-6)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec#cite_note-7)

History and derivation
----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parsec&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: History and derivation")]

Imagining an elongated [right triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_triangle "Right triangle") in space, where the shorter leg measures one au ([astronomical unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit "Astronomical unit"), the average [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth")–[Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun "Sun") distance) and the [subtended angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtended "Subtended") of the vertex opposite that leg measures one [arcsecond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcsecond "Arcsecond") (1⁄3600 of a degree), the parsec is defined as the length of the [_adjacent_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometry#Trigonometric_ratios "Trigonometry") leg. The value of a parsec can be derived through the rules of [trigonometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometry "Trigonometry"). The distance from Earth whereupon the radius of its solar orbit subtends one arcsecond.

One of the oldest methods used by astronomers to calculate the distance to a [star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star "Star") is to record the difference in angle between two measurements of the position of the star in the sky. The first measurement is taken from the Earth on one side of the Sun, and the second is taken approximately half a year later, when the Earth is on the opposite side of the Sun.[[b]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec#cite_note-orbit-8) The distance between the two positions of the Earth when the two measurements were taken is twice the distance between the Earth and the Sun. The difference in angle between the two measurements is twice the parallax angle, which is formed by lines from the Sun and Earth to the star at the distant [vertex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_(geometry)#Of_an_angle "Vertex (geometry)"). Then the distance to the star could be calculated using trigonometry.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec#cite_note-NASAparallax-9) The first successful published direct measurements of an object at interstellar distances were undertaken by German astronomer [Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Wilhelm_Bessel "Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel") in 1838, who used this approach to calculate the 3.5-parsec distance of [61 Cygni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/61_Cygni "61 Cygni").[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec#cite_note-10)

[![Image 2: Diagrams illustrating the apparent change in position of a celestial object when viewed from different positions in Earth's orbit.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/ParallaxV2.svg/500px-ParallaxV2.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:ParallaxV2.svg)

Stellar parallax motion from annual parallax

The parallax of a star is defined as half of the [angular distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_distance "Angular distance") that a star appears to move relative to the [celestial sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_sphere "Celestial sphere") as Earth orbits the Sun. Equivalently, it is the subtended angle, from that star's perspective, of the [semimajor axis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semimajor_axis "Semimajor axis") of the Earth's orbit. Substituting the star's parallax for the one arcsecond angle in the imaginary right triangle, the long leg of the triangle will measure the distance from the Sun to the star. A parsec can be defined as the length of the right triangle side adjacent to the vertex occupied by a star whose parallax angle is one arcsecond.

The use of the parsec as a unit of distance follows naturally from Bessel's method, because the distance in parsecs can be computed simply as the [reciprocal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicative_inverse "Multiplicative inverse") of the parallax angle in arcseconds (i.e.: if the parallax angle is 1 arcsecond, the object is 1 pc from the Sun; if the parallax angle is 0.5 arcseconds, the object is 2 pc away; etc.). No [trigonometric functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometric_function "Trigonometric function") are required in this relationship because the very small angles involved mean that the approximate solution of the [skinny triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skinny_triangle "Skinny triangle") can be applied.

Though it may have been used before, the term _parsec_ was first mentioned in an astronomical publication in 1913. [Astronomer Royal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomer_Royal "Astronomer Royal")[Frank Watson Dyson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Watson_Dyson "Frank Watson Dyson") expressed his concern for the need of a name for that unit of distance. He proposed the name _astron_, but mentioned that [Carl Charlier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Charlier "Carl Charlier") had suggested _[siriometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siriometer "Siriometer")_ and [Herbert Hall Turner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Hall_Turner "Herbert Hall Turner") had proposed _parsec_.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec#cite_note-dyson-5) It was Turner's proposal that stuck.

### Calculating the value of a parsec

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parsec&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Calculating the value of a parsec")]

By the 2015 definition, 1 au of arc length subtends an angle of 1″ at the center of the circle of radius 1 pc. That is, 1 pc = 1 au/tan(1″) ≈ 206,264.8 au by definition.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec#cite_note-11) Converting from degree/minute/second units to [radians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radians "Radians"),

![Image 3: {\displaystyle {\frac {1{\text{ pc}}}{1{\text{ au}}}}={\frac {180\times 60\times 60}{\pi }}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f1524f756b10f4b7a6034d41f58b393f425d7ef9), and![Image 4: {\displaystyle 1{\text{ au}}=149\,597\,870\,700{\text{ m}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1d55c89aa92e8c7b6a93399fcbc4347a1990df68) (exact by the 2012 definition of the au)
Therefore, ![Image 5: {\displaystyle \pi ~\mathrm {pc} =180\times 60\times 60~\mathrm {au} =180\times 60\times 60\times 149\,597\,870\,700~\mathrm {m} =96\,939\,420\,213\,600\,000~\mathrm {m} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/29eba1f0282776906f1bfa7cd08ec14d6e760719) (exact by the 2015 definition)

Therefore,

![Image 6: {\displaystyle 1~\mathrm {pc} ={\frac {96\,939\,420\,213\,600\,000}{\pi }}~\mathrm {m} =30\,856\,775\,814\,913\,673~\mathrm {m} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8123d3336bbebbf352f2db7b6ecd0c90b743488e) (to the nearest [metre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre "Metre")).

Approximately,

[![Image 7: Diagram of parsec.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/Parsec_%281%29.svg/500px-Parsec_%281%29.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Parsec_(1).svg "Diagram of parsec.")
In the diagram above (not to scale), **S** represents the Sun, and **E** the Earth at one point in its orbit (such as to form a right angle at **S**[[b]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec#cite_note-orbit-8)). Thus the distance **ES** is one astronomical unit (au). The angle **SDE** is one arcsecond (⁠1/3600⁠ of a [degree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle) "Degree (angle)")) so by definition **D** is a point in space at a distance of one parsec from the Sun. Through trigonometry, the distance **SD** is calculated as follows:

![Image 8: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\mathrm {SD} &={\frac {\mathrm {ES} }{\tan 1''}}\\&={\frac {\mathrm {ES} }{\tan \left({\frac {1}{60\times 60}}\times {\frac {\pi }{180}}\right)}}\\&\approx {\frac {1\,\mathrm {au} }{{\frac {1}{60\times 60}}\times {\frac {\pi }{180}}}}={\frac {648\,000}{\pi }}\,\mathrm {au} \approx 206\,264.81~\mathrm {au} .\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1a40985ca7e1f418cc3dab15844d8e3b802ea9a0)

Because the astronomical unit is defined to be 149 597 870 700[m](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre "Metre"),[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec#cite_note-12) the following can be calculated:

Therefore, 1 parsec≈ 206 264.806 247 096 astronomical units
≈ 3.085 677 581×10 16 metres
≈ 30.856 775 815 trillion [kilometres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilometre "Kilometre")
≈ 19.173 511 577 trillion [miles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mile "Mile")

Therefore, if 1[ly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-year "Light-year") ≈ 9.46×10 15 m,

Then 1 pc ≈ 3.261 563 777 ly
A corollary states that a parsec is also the distance from which a disc that is one au in diameter must be viewed for it to have an [angular diameter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_diameter "Angular diameter") of one arcsecond (by placing the observer at **D** and a disc spanning **ES**).

Mathematically, to calculate distance, given obtained angular measurements from instruments in arcseconds, the formula would be:

![Image 9: {\displaystyle {\text{Distance}}_{\text{star}}={\frac {{\text{Distance}}_{\text{earth-sun}}}{\tan {\frac {\theta }{3600}}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7dd31e2f9cdce9fb9f4c95251f2ebdb4f714ac87)

where _θ_ is the measured angle in arcseconds, Distance earth-sun is a constant (1 au or 1.5813×10−5 ly). The calculated stellar distance will be in the same measurement unit as used in Distance earth-sun (e.g. if Distance earth-sun = 1 au, unit for Distance star is in astronomical units; if Distance earth-sun = 1.5813×10−5 ly, unit for Distance star is in light-years).

The length of the parsec used in [IAU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAU "IAU") 2015 Resolution B2[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec#cite_note-13) (exactly ⁠648 000/π⁠ astronomical units) corresponds exactly to that derived using the small-angle calculation. This differs from the classic inverse-[tangent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent "Tangent") definition by about 200 km, i.e.: only after the 11th [significant figure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Significant_figure "Significant figure"). As the astronomical unit was defined by the IAU (2012) as an exact length in metres, so now the parsec corresponds to an exact length in metres. To the nearest metre, the small-angle parsec corresponds to 30 856 775 814 913 673 m.

Usage and measurement
---------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parsec&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Usage and measurement")]

The parallax method is the fundamental calibration step for [distance determination in astrophysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_distance_ladder "Cosmic distance ladder"); however, the accuracy of ground-based [telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telescope "Telescope") measurements of parallax angle is limited to about 0.01″, and thus to stars no more than 100 pc distant.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec#cite_note-14) This is because the Earth's atmosphere limits the sharpness of a star's image.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] Space-based telescopes are not limited by this effect and can accurately measure distances to objects beyond the limit of ground-based observations. Between 1989 and 1993, the _[Hipparcos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hipparcos "Hipparcos")_ satellite, launched by the [European Space Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Space_Agency "European Space Agency") (ESA), measured parallaxes for about 100 000 stars with an [astrometric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrometry "Astrometry") precision of about 0.97[mas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milliarcsecond "Milliarcsecond"), and obtained accurate measurements for stellar distances of stars up to 1000 pc away.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec#cite_note-15)[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec#cite_note-16)

ESA's [_Gaia_ satellite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_mission "Gaia mission"), which launched on 19 December 2013, gathered data with a goal of measuring one billion stellar distances to within 20 microarcsecond s, producing errors of 10% in measurements as far as the [Galactic Centre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_Center "Galactic Center"), about 8000 pc away in the [constellation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation "Constellation") of [Sagittarius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_(constellation) "Sagittarius (constellation)").[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec#cite_note-17)

Distances in parsecs
--------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parsec&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Distances in parsecs")]

### Distances less than a parsec

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parsec&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Distances less than a parsec")]

Distances expressed in fractions of a parsec usually involve objects within a single star system. So, for example:

*   One astronomical unit (au), the distance from the Sun to the Earth, is just under 5×10−6 pc.
*   The most distant [space probe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_probe "Space probe"), _[Voyager 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager\_1 "Voyager 1")_, was 0.000 7897 pc from Earth as of February 2024. _Voyager 1_ took 46 years to cover that distance.
*   The [Oort cloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oort_cloud "Oort cloud") is estimated to be approximately 0.6 pc in [diameter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter "Diameter")

[![Image 10](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/M87_jet.jpg/250px-M87_jet.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:M87_jet.jpg)

As observed by the [Hubble Space Telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope "Hubble Space Telescope"), the [astrophysical jet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysical_jet "Astrophysical jet") erupting from the [active galactic nucleus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_galactic_nucleus "Active galactic nucleus") of [M87](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_87 "Messier 87")[subtends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtends "Subtends")20″ and is thought to be 1.5 kiloparsecs (4,892[ly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-year "Light-year")) long (the jet is somewhat foreshortened from Earth's perspective).

### Parsecs and kiloparsecs

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parsec&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Parsecs and kiloparsecs")]

Distances expressed in parsecs (pc) include distances between nearby stars, such as those in the same [spiral arm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_arm "Spiral arm") or [globular cluster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globular_cluster "Globular cluster"). A distance of 1,000 parsecs (3,262 ly) is denoted by the kiloparsec (kpc). Astronomers typically use kiloparsecs to express distances between parts of a [galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy "Galaxy") or within [groups of galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_group "Galaxy group").[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec#cite_note-18) So, for example:

*   [Proxima Centauri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxima_Centauri "Proxima Centauri"), the nearest known star to Earth other than the Sun, is about 1.3 parsecs (4.24 ly) away by direct parallax measurement.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec#cite_note-19)
*   The distance to the [open cluster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_cluster "Open cluster")[Pleiades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleiades "Pleiades") is 130±10 pc (420±30 ly) from us per _[Hipparcos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hipparcos "Hipparcos")_ parallax measurement.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec#cite_note-20)
*   The [centre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_Center "Galactic Center") of the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way "Milky Way") is more than 8 kiloparsecs (26,000 ly) from the Earth and the Milky Way is roughly 34 kiloparsecs (110,000 ly) across.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec#cite_note-21)
*   [ESO 383-76](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESO_383-76 "ESO 383-76"), one of the [largest known galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_galaxies "List of largest galaxies"), has a diameter of 540.9 kpc (1.8 million ly).[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec#cite_note-22)
*   The [Andromeda Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy "Andromeda Galaxy") ([M31](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_object "Messier object")) is about 780 kpc (2.5 million ly) away from the Earth.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec#cite_note-23)

### Megaparsecs and gigaparsecs

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parsec&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Megaparsecs and gigaparsecs")]

Astronomers typically express the distances between neighbouring galaxies and [galaxy clusters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_cluster "Galaxy cluster") in megaparsecs (Mpc). A megaparsec is one million parsecs, or about 3,260,000 light years.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec#cite_note-24) Sometimes, galactic distances are given in units of Mpc/_h_ (as in "50/_h_ Mpc", also written "50 Mpc _h_−1"). _h_ is a constant (the "[dimensionless Hubble constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionless_Hubble_constant "Dimensionless Hubble constant")") in the range 0.5 <_h_< 0.75 reflecting the uncertainty in the value of the [Hubble constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_constant "Hubble constant")_H_ for the rate of expansion of the universe: _h_ = ⁠_H_/100(km/s)/Mpc⁠. The Hubble constant becomes relevant when converting an observed [redshift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift "Redshift")_z_ into a distance _d_ using the formula _d_ ≈ ⁠_[c](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed\_of\_light "Speed of light")_/_H_⁠ × _z_.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec#cite_note-25)

One gigaparsec (Gpc) is [one billion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1000000000_(number) "1000000000 (number)") parsecs — one of the largest [units of length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(length) "Orders of magnitude (length)") commonly used. One gigaparsec is about 3.26 billion ly, or roughly ⁠1/14⁠ of the distance to the [horizon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_horizon#Practical_horizons "Cosmological horizon") of the [observable universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe "Observable universe") (dictated by the [cosmic microwave background radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background_radiation "Cosmic microwave background radiation")). Astronomers typically use gigaparsecs to express the sizes of [large-scale structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large-scale_structure_of_the_cosmos "Large-scale structure of the cosmos") such as the size of, and distance to, the [CfA2 Great Wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CfA2_Great_Wall "CfA2 Great Wall"); the distances between galaxy clusters; and the distance to [quasars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasar "Quasar").

For example:

*   The [Andromeda Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy "Andromeda Galaxy") is about 0.78 Mpc (2.5 million ly) from the Earth.
*   The nearest large [galaxy cluster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_cluster "Galaxy cluster"), the [Virgo Cluster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgo_Cluster "Virgo Cluster"), is about 16.5 Mpc (54 million ly) from the Earth.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec#cite_note-26)
*   The galaxy [RXJ1242-11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RXJ1242-11 "RXJ1242-11"), observed to have a [supermassive black hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermassive_black_hole "Supermassive black hole") core similar to the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way "Milky Way")'s, is about 200 Mpc (650 million ly) from the Earth.
*   The [galaxy filament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_filament "Galaxy filament")[Hercules–Corona Borealis Great Wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hercules%E2%80%93Corona_Borealis_Great_Wall "Hercules–Corona Borealis Great Wall"), which is since November 2013 the [largest known structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_known_cosmic_structures "List of largest known cosmic structures") in the universe, is about 3 Gpc (9.8 billion ly) across.
*   The [particle horizon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_horizon "Particle horizon") (the boundary of the [observable universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe "Observable universe")) has a radius of about 14 Gpc (46 billion ly).[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec#cite_note-27)

To determine the number of stars in the Milky Way, volumes in cubic kiloparsecs[[c]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec#cite_note-vol-28) (kpc 3) are selected in various directions. All the stars in these volumes are counted and the total number of stars statistically determined. The number of globular clusters, dust clouds, and interstellar gas is determined in a similar fashion. To determine the number of galaxies in [superclusters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercluster "Supercluster"), volumes in cubic megaparsecs[[c]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec#cite_note-vol-28) (Mpc 3) are selected. All the galaxies in these volumes are classified and tallied. The total number of galaxies can then be determined statistically. The huge [Boötes Void](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bo%C3%B6tes_Void "Boötes Void") is measured in cubic megaparsecs.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec#cite_note-KirshnerOemler1981-29)

In [physical cosmology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_cosmology "Physical cosmology"), volumes of cubic gigaparsecs[[c]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec#cite_note-vol-28) (Gpc 3) are selected to determine the distribution of matter in the visible universe and to determine the number of galaxies and quasars. The Sun is currently the only star in its cubic parsec,[[c]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec#cite_note-vol-28) (pc 3) but in globular clusters the stellar density could be from 100–1000 pc−3.

The observational volume of gravitational wave interferometers (e.g., [LIGO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIGO "LIGO"), [Virgo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgo_interferometer "Virgo interferometer")) is stated in terms of cubic megaparsecs[[c]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec#cite_note-vol-28) (Mpc 3) and is essentially the value of the effective distance cubed.

*   [Distance measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance_measure "Distance measure")

The parsec is used incorrectly as a measurement of time by [Han Solo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Solo "Han Solo") in the first _[Star Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A\_New\_Hope "A New Hope")_ film, when he claims his ship, the _[Millennium Falcon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium\_Falcon "Millennium Falcon")_ "made the Kessel Run in less than 12 parsecs," originally with the intention of presenting Solo as "something of a bull artist who didn't always know precisely what he was talking about."[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] The claim is repeated in _[The Force Awakens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star\_Wars:\_The\_Force\_Awakens "Star Wars: The Force Awakens")_,[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] but in _[Solo: A Star Wars Story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solo:\_A\_Star\_Wars\_Story "Solo: A Star Wars Story")_ it is stated that the _[Millennium Falcon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium\_Falcon "Millennium Falcon")_ has traveled a shorter distance (as opposed to a quicker time) due to a more dangerous route through the Kessel Run, enabled by its speed and maneuverability.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec#cite_note-30) It is also used incorrectly in _[The Mandalorian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Mandalorian "The Mandalorian")_.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec#cite_note-31)
