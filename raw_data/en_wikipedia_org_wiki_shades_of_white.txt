White Common connotations Purity, Heaven , snow , knowledge , clarity, innocence , brightness Color coordinates Hex triplet #FFFFFF sRGB B ( r , g , b ) (255, 255, 255) HSV ( h , s , v ) (0°, 0%, 100%) CIELCh uv ( L , C , h ) (100, 0, 0°) Source By definition B : Normalized to [0–255] (byte) Shades of white are colors that differ slightly from the CIE standard illuminant D65 , a white point that represents the average color of daylight at noon. There isn't one objectively pure white, as noon daylight varies by location and atmospheric conditions, and the choice of using D65 instead of direct sunlight or a white point on the Planckian locus is arbitrary. For simplicity, this article will use the term pure white for the D65 white point.

Variations of white include what are commonly termed off-white colors, which may be considered part of a neutral color scheme.

In color theory , a shade is a pure color mixed with black (or having a lower lightness ). Strictly speaking, a "shade of white" would be a neutral gray . This article is also about off-white colors that vary from pure white in hue , and in chroma (also called saturation, or intensity).

Colors often considered "shades of white" include cream , eggshell , ivory , Navajo white , and vanilla . Even the lighting of a room, however, can cause a pure white to be perceived as off-white.

[ 1 ] Off-white colors were pervasively paired with beiges in the 1930s, [ 2 ] and especially popular again from roughly 1955 to 1975.

[ 3 ] In terms of paint, off-white paints are now becoming more popular, with Benjamin Moore having 152 shades of off-whites, Behr having 167, and PPG having 315.

[ 4 ] Whiteness measures the degree to which a surface is white in colorimetry .

Web colors [ edit ] Below is a chart showing the computer web color shades of white. An achromatic white is a white color in which the red, green, and blues codes are exactly equal. The web colors white and white smoke are achromatic colors. A chromatic shade of white is a white color in which the red, green, and blue codes are not exactly equal, but are close to each other, which is what makes it a shade of white.

Its purpose is to emulate daylight during noon, to give a natural illumination. The perception of white is evoked when light is distributed along the spectrum roughly like a blackbody from 5800–6800K, and when such light has high brightness compared to the surroundings. A white visual stimulation will have negligible hue and grayness .
