Construction of metric outer measures [ edit ] Let τ : Σ → [0, +∞] be a set function defined on a class Σ of subsets of X containing the empty set ∅, such that τ (∅) = 0. One can show that the set function μ defined by μ μ ( E ) = lim δ δ → → 0 μ μ δ δ ( E ) , {\displaystyle \mu (E)=\lim _{\delta \to 0}\mu _{\delta }(E),} where μ μ δ δ ( E ) = inf { ∑ ∑ i = 1 ∞ ∞ τ τ ( C i ) | C i ∈ ∈ Σ Σ , diam ⁡ ⁡ ( C i ) ≤ ≤ δ δ , ⋃ ⋃ i = 1 ∞ ∞ C i ⊇ ⊇ E } , {\displaystyle \mu _{\delta }(E)=\inf \left\{\left.\sum _{i=1}^{\infty }\tau (C_{i})\right|C_{i}\in \Sigma ,\operatorname {diam} (C_{i})\leq \delta ,\bigcup _{i=1}^{\infty }C_{i}\supseteq E\right\},} is not only an outer measure, but in fact a metric outer measure as well. (Some authors prefer to take a supremum over δ > 0 rather than a limit as δ → 0; the two give the same result, since μ δ ( E ) increases as δ decreases.) For the function τ one can use τ τ ( C ) = diam ⁡ ⁡ ( C ) s , {\displaystyle \tau (C)=\operatorname {diam} (C)^{s},\,} where s is a positive constant; this τ is defined on the power set of all subsets of X .  By Carathéodory's extension theorem , the outer measure can be promoted to a full measure; the associated measure μ is the s -dimensional Hausdorff measure .  More generally, one could use any so-called dimension function .

This construction is very important in fractal geometry , since this is how the Hausdorff measure is obtained. The packing measure is superficially similar, but is obtained in a different manner, by packing balls inside a set, rather than covering the set.

Properties of metric outer measures [ edit ] Let μ be a metric outer measure on a metric space ( X , d ).

For any sequence of subsets A n , n ∈ N , of X with A 1 ⊆ ⊆ A 2 ⊆ ⊆ ⋯ ⋯ ⊆ ⊆ A = ⋃ ⋃ n = 1 ∞ ∞ A n , {\displaystyle A_{1}\subseteq A_{2}\subseteq \dots \subseteq A=\bigcup _{n=1}^{\infty }A_{n},} and such that A n and A \ A n +1 are positively separated, it follows that μ μ ( A ) = sup n ∈ ∈ N μ μ ( A n ) .

{\displaystyle \mu (A)=\sup _{n\in \mathbb {N} }\mu (A_{n}).} All the d - closed subsets E of X are μ -measurable in the sense that they satisfy the following version of Carathéodory's criterion: for all sets A and B with A ⊆ E and B ⊆ X \ E , μ μ ( A ∪ ∪ B ) = μ μ ( A ) + μ μ ( B ) .

{\displaystyle \mu (A\cup B)=\mu (A)+\mu (B).} Consequently, all the Borel subsets of X — those obtainable as countable unions, intersections and set-theoretic differences of open/closed sets — are μ -measurable.
