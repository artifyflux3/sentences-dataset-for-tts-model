At this boundary a sharp gradient in temperature occurs between these two air masses , each at very different temperatures .

[ 1 ] The polar front arises as a result of cold polar air meeting warm tropical air.  It is a stationary front as the air masses are not moving against each other and stays stable.

[ 2 ] Off the coast of eastern North America , especially in winter , there is a sharp temperature gradient between the snow-covered land and the warm offshore currents.

The polar front theory says that mid-latitude extratropical cyclones form on boundaries between warm and cold air.

[ 3 ] In winter, the polar front shifts towards the Equator , whereas high pressure systems dominate more in the summer .
