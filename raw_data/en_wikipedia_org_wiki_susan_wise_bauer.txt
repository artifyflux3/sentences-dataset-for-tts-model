Early life and education [ edit ] Susan Wise Bauer was born on August 8, 1968, in Chelsea, Massachusetts . She grew up on a farm in Virginia, as the daughter of Jessie and James Wise. Her father was a pediatrician, and her mother was an educator. She and her two siblings received a homeschool education starting in the 1970s.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Bauer holds a Master of Divinity from Westminster Theological Seminary in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania , a Master of Arts in English and a Ph.D.

in American Studies from The College of William and Mary . She received her B.A. from Liberty University . She has been a member of the English faculty at William and Mary since 1993.  She married Peter John Bauer, a pastor, in 1990.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Career [ edit ] Although she had written and published two novels in the 1990s, Bauer drew much wider attention in 1999 with the publication of The Well-Trained Mind: A Guide to Classical Education at Home , published by W. W. Norton , which was well reviewed and quickly became one of the primary sources for homeschooling families who wished to focus on classical education , sometimes also referred to as the Trivium or the Great Books movement .  Bauer followed up The Well-Trained Mind in 2003 with The Well-Educated Mind: A Guide to the Classical Education You Never Had , also published by Norton.  Along with several volumes in the History of the World series, Bauer has also written children's books and The Art of the Public Grovel: Sexual Sin and Public Confession in America , published by Princeton University Press in 2008.

[ 2 ] Along with her best-selling books on education and history, Bauer was also a contributing editor for the defunct journal Books & Culture .  Her essays on literature and American religion have been cited by such diverse authors as Randall Balmer [ 3 ] and Jennifer Harris, [ 4 ] and have also appeared in a number of anthologies.

[ 5 ] Her works have been translated and published in Korea by Theory & Praxis and Goldenbough/Minums; in the Netherlands by Uitgeverij Mozaiek (Zoetermeer); in Spain by Paidos; in China by Peking University Press; in Indonesia by  Elex Media Komputindo; in Russia by AST Publishing Group; in Serbian by Laguna and in Bulgaria by Prozorets.

Bauer has homeschooled her four children, and lives with her husband on a family farm in Charles City, Virginia .

[ 6 ] She offers positive perspectives towards religion and homeschooling in some of her work, [ 7 ] and is considered to be a leader in the homeschooling movement.
