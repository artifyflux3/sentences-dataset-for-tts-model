Many of these were sent in the aim of searching for extra-terrestrial intelligence (SETI) , and are often called ' active SETI ' or 'METI' (Messages to Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence) projects.

This is a dynamic list and may never be able to satisfy particular standards for completeness. You can help by adding missing items with reliable sources .
