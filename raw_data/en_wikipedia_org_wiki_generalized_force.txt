They are obtained from the applied forces F i , i = 1, …, n , acting on a system that has its configuration defined in terms of generalized coordinates.  In the formulation of virtual work , each generalized force is the coefficient of the variation of a generalized coordinate.

Virtual work [ edit ] Generalized forces can be obtained from the computation of the virtual work , δW , of the applied forces.

[ 1 ] : 265 The virtual work of the forces, F i , acting on the particles P i , i = 1, ..., n , is given by δ δ W = ∑ ∑ i = 1 n F i ⋅ ⋅ δ δ r i {\displaystyle \delta W=\sum _{i=1}^{n}\mathbf {F} _{i}\cdot \delta \mathbf {r} _{i}} where δ r i is the virtual displacement of the particle P i .

Generalized coordinates [ edit ] Let the position vectors of each of the particles, r i , be a function of the generalized coordinates, q j , j = 1, ..., m .  Then the virtual displacements δ r i are given by δ δ r i = ∑ ∑ j = 1 m ∂ ∂ r i ∂ ∂ q j δ δ q j , i = 1 , … … , n , {\displaystyle \delta \mathbf {r} _{i}=\sum _{j=1}^{m}{\frac {\partial \mathbf {r} _{i}}{\partial q_{j}}}\delta q_{j},\quad i=1,\ldots ,n,} where δq j is the virtual displacement of the generalized coordinate q j .

The virtual work for the system of particles becomes δ δ W = F 1 ⋅ ⋅ ∑ ∑ j = 1 m ∂ ∂ r 1 ∂ ∂ q j δ δ q j + ⋯ ⋯ + F n ⋅ ⋅ ∑ ∑ j = 1 m ∂ ∂ r n ∂ ∂ q j δ δ q j .

{\displaystyle \delta W=\mathbf {F} _{1}\cdot \sum _{j=1}^{m}{\frac {\partial \mathbf {r} _{1}}{\partial q_{j}}}\delta q_{j}+\dots +\mathbf {F} _{n}\cdot \sum _{j=1}^{m}{\frac {\partial \mathbf {r} _{n}}{\partial q_{j}}}\delta q_{j}.} Collect the coefficients of δq j so that δ δ W = ∑ ∑ i = 1 n F i ⋅ ⋅ ∂ ∂ r i ∂ ∂ q 1 δ δ q 1 + ⋯ ⋯ + ∑ ∑ i = 1 n F i ⋅ ⋅ ∂ ∂ r i ∂ ∂ q m δ δ q m .

{\displaystyle \delta W=\sum _{i=1}^{n}\mathbf {F} _{i}\cdot {\frac {\partial \mathbf {r} _{i}}{\partial q_{1}}}\delta q_{1}+\dots +\sum _{i=1}^{n}\mathbf {F} _{i}\cdot {\frac {\partial \mathbf {r} _{i}}{\partial q_{m}}}\delta q_{m}.} Generalized forces [ edit ] The virtual work of a system of particles can be written in the form δ δ W = Q 1 δ δ q 1 + ⋯ ⋯ + Q m δ δ q m , {\displaystyle \delta W=Q_{1}\delta q_{1}+\dots +Q_{m}\delta q_{m},} where Q j = ∑ ∑ i = 1 n F i ⋅ ⋅ ∂ ∂ r i ∂ ∂ q j , j = 1 , … … , m , {\displaystyle Q_{j}=\sum _{i=1}^{n}\mathbf {F} _{i}\cdot {\frac {\partial \mathbf {r} _{i}}{\partial q_{j}}},\quad j=1,\ldots ,m,} are called the generalized forces associated with the generalized coordinates q j , j = 1, ..., m .

Velocity formulation [ edit ] In the application of the principle of virtual work it is often convenient to obtain virtual displacements from the velocities of the system.  For the n particle system, let the velocity of each particle P i be V i , then the virtual displacement δ r i can also be written in the form [ 2 ] δ δ r i = ∑ ∑ j = 1 m ∂ ∂ V i ∂ ∂ q ˙ ˙ j δ δ q j , i = 1 , … … , n .

{\displaystyle \delta \mathbf {r} _{i}=\sum _{j=1}^{m}{\frac {\partial \mathbf {V} _{i}}{\partial {\dot {q}}_{j}}}\delta q_{j},\quad i=1,\ldots ,n.} This means that the generalized force, Q j , can also be determined as Q j = ∑ ∑ i = 1 n F i ⋅ ⋅ ∂ ∂ V i ∂ ∂ q ˙ ˙ j , j = 1 , … … , m .

{\displaystyle Q_{j}=\sum _{i=1}^{n}\mathbf {F} _{i}\cdot {\frac {\partial \mathbf {V} _{i}}{\partial {\dot {q}}_{j}}},\quad j=1,\ldots ,m.} D'Alembert's principle [ edit ] D'Alembert formulated the dynamics of a particle as the equilibrium of the applied forces with an inertia force ( apparent force ), called D'Alembert's principle .  The inertia force of a particle, P i , of mass m i is F i ∗ ∗ = − − m i A i , i = 1 , … … , n , {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} _{i}^{*}=-m_{i}\mathbf {A} _{i},\quad i=1,\ldots ,n,} where A i is the acceleration of the particle.

If the configuration of the particle system depends on the generalized coordinates q j , j = 1, ..., m , then the generalized inertia force is given by Q j ∗ ∗ = ∑ ∑ i = 1 n F i ∗ ∗ ⋅ ⋅ ∂ ∂ V i ∂ ∂ q ˙ ˙ j , j = 1 , … … , m .

{\displaystyle Q_{j}^{*}=\sum _{i=1}^{n}\mathbf {F} _{i}^{*}\cdot {\frac {\partial \mathbf {V} _{i}}{\partial {\dot {q}}_{j}}},\quad j=1,\ldots ,m.} D'Alembert's form of the principle of virtual work yields δ δ W = ( Q 1 + Q 1 ∗ ∗ ) δ δ q 1 + ⋯ ⋯ + ( Q m + Q m ∗ ∗ ) δ δ q m .

{\displaystyle \delta W=(Q_{1}+Q_{1}^{*})\delta q_{1}+\dots +(Q_{m}+Q_{m}^{*})\delta q_{m}.} See also [ edit ] Lagrangian mechanics Generalized coordinates Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry) Virtual work References [ edit ] ^ Torby, Bruce (1984). "Energy Methods".
