Uncrewed visiting spacecraft are excluded (see Uncrewed spaceflights to the International Space Station for details). ISS crew members are listed in bold . "Time docked" refers to the spacecraft and does not always correspond to the crew.

As of 31 July 2025 [ref] , 290 people from 27 countries had visited the space station, many of them multiple times. The United States sent 170 people, Russia sent 64, 11 were Japanese, nine were Canadian, six were Italian, four were French, four were German, two from the United Arab Emirates, Hungary and Saudi Arabia and one each from Belgium, Brazil, Denmark, Israel, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, the Netherlands, India, Turkey, Sweden, Belarus, South Africa, Poland, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.

[ 1 ] U.S.

Space Shuttle missions were capable of carrying more humans and cargo than the Russian Soyuz spacecraft, resulting in more U.S. short-term human visits until the Space Shuttle program was discontinued in 2011. Between 2011 and 2020, Soyuz was the sole means of human transport to the ISS, delivering mostly long-term crew. Russian cargo deliveries have been exclusively carried out by the uncrewed missions of Progress spacecraft, requiring fewer human spaceflights.

[ citation needed ] Continued international collaboration on ISS missions has been thrown into doubt by the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine and related sanctions on Russia, [ 2 ] but is still continuing as of 2024.
