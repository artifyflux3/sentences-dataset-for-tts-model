For statistical consistency and convenience, each country or area is shown in one continental subregion only. For example, Russia (a transcontinental country in both Eastern Europe and Northern Asia ) has been included in Eastern Europe only.

A subregion is a part of a larger geographical region or continent .

Cardinal directions are commonly used to define subregions. There are many criteria for creating systems of subregions; this article is focusing on the United Nations geoscheme , which is a changing, constantly updated, UN tool based on specific political geography and demography considerations relevant in UN statistics.

United Nations subregions [ edit ] Main article: United Nations geoscheme Further information: List of countries and territories by the United Nations geoscheme The Statistics Division of the United Nations (UN) is in charge of the collection, processing, and dissemination of statistical information for the UN.

[ 1 ] In 1999, it developed a system of macro-geographical (continental) regions, subregions, and other selected economic groups to report advances towards achieving numerous Millennium Development Goals worldwide. These statistical divisions were devised for statistical purposes and is used for carrying out statistical analysis.

[ 2 ] The division's first publication was the book World's Women 2000: Trends and Statistics in 2000.

According to the UN, the assignment of countries or areas to specific groupings is for statistical convenience and does not imply any assumption regarding political or other affiliation of countries or territories.

[ 3 ] Subregions by landmass and continent [ edit ] The following is a non-exhaustive list of subregions, arranged alphabetically by region (i.e., by continent); in the UN geoscheme, higher-level, macro-geographical regions are arranged to the extent possible according to continents.

Sequence used in the list (not all criteria are applied to each continent): by the UN Statistics Division's geoscheme by geography by physiography by geopolitics by human geography by economics by culture by language by religion by biogeography by historical division by geology Afro-Eurasia [ edit ] Afro-Eurasia is a continental landmass comprising the continents of Africa , Asia , and Europe .
