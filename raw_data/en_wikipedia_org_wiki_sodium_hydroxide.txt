[Infobox references](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Chemical_infobox#References "Wikipedia:Chemical infobox")

**Sodium hydroxide**, also known as **lye** and **caustic soda**,[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#cite_note-msd-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#cite_note-msd2-2) is an [inorganic compound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inorganic_compound "Inorganic compound") with the formula NaOH. It is a white solid [ionic compound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionic_compound "Ionic compound") consisting of [sodium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium "Sodium")[cations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cation "Cation")Na+ and [hydroxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxide "Hydroxide")[anions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anion "Anion")OH−.

Sodium hydroxide is a highly [corrosive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrosive "Corrosive")[base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_(chemistry) "Base (chemistry)") and [alkali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkali "Alkali") that decomposes [lipids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid "Lipid") and [proteins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein "Protein") at ambient [temperatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature "Temperature"), and may cause severe [chemical burns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_burn "Chemical burn") at high concentrations. It is highly soluble in [water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water "Water"), and readily absorbs [moisture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moisture "Moisture") and [carbon dioxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide "Carbon dioxide") from the [air](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air "Air"). It forms a series of [hydrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrate "Hydrate")NaOH·_n_ H 2 O.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#cite_note-siem-13) The monohydrate NaOH·H 2 O crystallizes from water solutions between 12.3 and 61.8°C. The commercially available "sodium hydroxide" is often this monohydrate, and published data may refer to it instead of the [anhydrous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anhydrous "Anhydrous") compound.

As one of the simplest hydroxides, sodium hydroxide is frequently used alongside neutral [water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water "Water") and acidic [hydrochloric acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrochloric_acid "Hydrochloric acid") to demonstrate the pH scale to chemistry students.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#cite_note-14)

Sodium hydroxide is used in many industries: in the making of [wood pulp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood_pulp "Wood pulp") and [paper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper "Paper"), [textiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile "Textile"), [drinking water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking_water "Drinking water"), [soaps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soap "Soap") and [detergents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detergent "Detergent"), and as a [drain cleaner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_drain_cleaners#Alkaline_drain_openers "Chemical drain cleaners"). Worldwide production in 2022 was approximately 83 million tons.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#cite_note-15)

### Physical properties

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sodium_hydroxide&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Physical properties")]

Pure sodium hydroxide is a colorless crystalline solid that melts at 318°C (604°F) without decomposition and boils at 1,388°C (2,530°F). It is highly soluble in water, with a lower solubility in [polar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_polarity "Chemical polarity")[solvents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solvent "Solvent") such as [ethanol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol "Ethanol") and [methanol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methanol "Methanol").[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#cite_note-Protank-2018-16) Sodium hydroxide is insoluble in [ether](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ether "Ether") and other non-polar solvents.

Similar to the hydration of sulfuric acid, [dissolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissolution_(chemistry) "Dissolution (chemistry)") of solid sodium hydroxide in water is a highly [exothermic reaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exothermic_reaction "Exothermic reaction")[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#cite_note-17) where a large amount of heat is liberated, posing a threat to safety through the possibility of splashing. The resulting solution is usually colorless and odorless. As with other alkaline solutions, it feels slippery with skin contact due to the process of [saponification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saponification "Saponification") that occurs between NaOH and natural skin oils.

Concentrated (50%) aqueous solutions of sodium hydroxide have a characteristic [viscosity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscosity "Viscosity"), 78 m[Pa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(unit) "Pascal (unit)")·s, that is much greater than that of water (1.0 mPa·s) and near that of olive oil (85 mPa·s) at room temperature. The viscosity of aqueous NaOH, as with any liquid chemical, is inversely related to its temperature, i.e., its viscosity decreases as temperature increases, and vice versa. The viscosity of sodium hydroxide solutions plays a direct role in its application as well as its storage.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#cite_note-Protank-2018-16)

Sodium hydroxide can form several hydrates NaOH·_n_ H 2 O, which result in a complex solubility diagram that was described in detail by [Spencer Umfreville Pickering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spencer_Umfreville_Pickering "Spencer Umfreville Pickering") in 1893.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#cite_note-pick-18) The known hydrates and the approximate ranges of temperature and concentration (mass percent of NaOH) of their [saturated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturated_solution "Saturated solution") water solutions are:[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#cite_note-siem-13)

*   Heptahydrate, NaOH·7H 2 O: from −28°C (18.8%) to −24°C (22.2%).[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#cite_note-pick-18)
*   Pentahydrate, NaOH·5H 2 O: from −24°C (22.2%) to −17.7°C (24.8%).[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#cite_note-pick-18)

*   Trihydrate, NaOH·3H 2 O: metastable.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#cite_note-pick-18)
*   Dihydrate, NaOH·2H 2 O: from 5.0°C (45.7%) to 12.3°C (51%).[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#cite_note-pick-18)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#cite_note-siem-13)
*   Monohydrate, NaOH·H 2 O: from 12.3°C (51%) to 65.10°C (69%) then to 62.63°C (73.1%).[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#cite_note-pick-18)[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#cite_note-murch-20)

Early reports refer to hydrates with _n_ = 0.5 or _n_ = 2/3, but later careful investigations failed to confirm their existence.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#cite_note-murch-20)

The only hydrates with stable melting points are NaOH·H 2 O (65.10°C) and NaOH·3.5H 2 O (15.38°C). The other hydrates, except the metastable ones NaOH·3H 2 O and NaOH·4H 2 O (β) can be crystallized from solutions of the proper composition, as listed above. However, solutions of NaOH can be easily supercooled by many degrees, which allows the formation of hydrates (including the metastable ones) from solutions with different concentrations.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#cite_note-siem-13)[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#cite_note-murch-20)

For example, when a solution of NaOH and water with 1:2 mole ratio (52.6% NaOH by mass) is cooled, the monohydrate normally starts to crystallize (at about 22°C) before the dihydrate. However, the solution can easily be supercooled down to −15°C, at which point it may quickly crystallize as the dihydrate. When heated, the solid dihydrate might melt directly into a solution at 13.35°C; however, once the temperature exceeds 12.58°C it often decomposes into solid monohydrate and a liquid solution. Even the _n_ = 3.5 hydrate is difficult to crystallize, because the solution supercools so much that other hydrates become more stable.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#cite_note-siem-13)

A hot water solution containing 73.1% (mass) of NaOH is a [eutectic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eutectic "Eutectic") that solidifies at about 62.63°C as an intimate mix of anhydrous and monohydrate crystals.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#cite_note-brodale-21)[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#cite_note-murch-20)

A second stable eutectic composition is 45.4% (mass) of NaOH, that solidifies at about 4.9°C into a mixture of crystals of the dihydrate and of the 3.5-hydrate.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#cite_note-siem-13)

The third stable eutectic has 18.4% (mass) of NaOH. It solidifies at about −28.7°C as a mixture of water ice and the heptahydrate NaOH·7H 2 O.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#cite_note-pick-18)[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#cite_note-conde-22)

When solutions with less than 18.4% NaOH are cooled, water [ice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice "Ice") crystallizes first, leaving the NaOH in solution.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#cite_note-pick-18)

The α form of the tetrahydrate has density 1.33 g/cm 3. It melts congruously at 7.55°C into a liquid with 35.7% NaOH and density 1.392 g/cm 3, and therefore floats on it like ice on water. However, at about 4.9°C it may instead melt incongruously into a mixture of solid NaOH·3.5H 2 O and a liquid solution.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#cite_note-mrawIII-19)

The β form of the tetrahydrate is metastable, and often transforms spontaneously to the α form when cooled below −20°C.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#cite_note-mrawIII-19) Once initiated, the exothermic transformation is complete in a few minutes, with a 6.5% increase in volume of the solid. The β form can be crystallized from supercooled solutions at −26°C, and melts partially at −1.83°C.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#cite_note-mrawIII-19)

The "sodium hydroxide" of commerce is often the monohydrate (density 1.829 g/cm 3). Physical data in technical literature may refer to this form, rather than the anhydrous compound.

NaOH and its monohydrate form orthorhombic crystals with the space groups Cmcm ([oS8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_symbol "Pearson symbol")) and Pbca (oP24), respectively. The monohydrate cell dimensions are a = 1.1825, b = 0.6213, c = 0.6069 [nm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanometer "Nanometer"). The atoms are arranged in a [hydrargillite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrargillite "Hydrargillite")-like layer structure, with each sodium atom surrounded by six oxygen atoms, three each from hydroxide ions and three from water molecules. The hydrogen atoms of the hydroxyls form strong bonds with oxygen atoms within each O layer. Adjacent O layers are held together by [hydrogen bonds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_bond "Hydrogen bond") between water molecules.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#cite_note-jacobs-23)

### Chemical properties

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sodium_hydroxide&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Chemical properties")]

#### Reaction with acids

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sodium_hydroxide&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Reaction with acids")]

Sodium hydroxide reacts with protic acids to produce water and the corresponding salts. For example, when sodium hydroxide reacts with [hydrochloric acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrochloric_acid "Hydrochloric acid"), [sodium chloride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_chloride "Sodium chloride") is formed:

NaOH(aq) + HCl(aq) → NaCl(aq) + H 2 O(l)
In general, such [neutralization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutralization_(chemistry) "Neutralization (chemistry)") reactions are represented by one simple net ionic equation:

OH−(aq) + H+(aq) → H 2 O(l)
This type of reaction with a strong acid releases heat, and hence is [exothermic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exothermic_reaction "Exothermic reaction"). Such [acid–base reactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid%E2%80%93base_reaction "Acid–base reaction") can also be used for [titrations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titration "Titration"). However, sodium hydroxide is not used as a [primary standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_standard "Primary standard") because it is [hygroscopic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygroscopic "Hygroscopic") and absorbs [carbon dioxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide "Carbon dioxide") from air.

#### Reaction with acidic oxides

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sodium_hydroxide&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Reaction with acidic oxides")]

Sodium hydroxide also reacts with [acidic oxides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_anhydride "Acid anhydride"), such as [sulfur dioxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfur_dioxide "Sulfur dioxide"). Such reactions are often used to "[scrub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrubber "Scrubber")" harmful acidic gases (like SO 2 and H 2 S) produced in the burning of coal and thus prevent their release into the atmosphere. For example,

2 NaOH + SO 2 → Na 2 SO 3 + H 2 O

#### Reaction with metals and oxides

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sodium_hydroxide&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Reaction with metals and oxides")]

Glass reacts slowly with aqueous sodium hydroxide solutions at ambient temperatures to form soluble [silicates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicate "Silicate"). Because of this, glass joints and [stopcocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stopcock "Stopcock") exposed to sodium hydroxide have a tendency to "freeze". [Flasks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory_flask "Laboratory flask") and glass-lined [chemical reactors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reactor "Chemical reactor") are damaged by long exposure to hot sodium hydroxide, which also frosts the glass. Sodium hydroxide does not attack [iron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron "Iron") at room temperature, since iron does not have [amphoteric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphoteric "Amphoteric") properties (i.e., it only dissolves in acid, not base). Nevertheless, at high temperatures (e.g. above 500°C), iron can react [endothermically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothermic "Endothermic") with sodium hydroxide to form [iron(III) oxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron(III)_oxide "Iron(III) oxide"), [sodium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium "Sodium") metal, and [hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen "Hydrogen") gas.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#cite_note-24) This is due to the lower [enthalpy of formation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enthalpy_of_formation "Enthalpy of formation") of iron(III) oxide (−824.2 kJ/mol) compared to sodium hydroxide (−500 kJ/mol) and positive entropy change of the reaction, which implies spontaneity at high temperatures (ΔST > ΔH, ΔG < 0) and non-spontaneity at low temperatures (ΔST < ΔH, ΔG > 0). Consider the following reaction between molten sodium hydroxide and finely divided iron filings:

4 Fe + 6 NaOH → 2 Fe 2 O 3 + 6 Na + 3 H 2
A few [transition metals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_metal "Transition metal"), however, may react quite vigorously with sodium hydroxide under milder conditions.

In 1986, an aluminium [road tanker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank_truck "Tank truck") in the UK was mistakenly used to transport 25% sodium hydroxide solution,[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#cite_note-25) causing pressurization of the contents and damage to tankers. The pressurization is due to the hydrogen gas which is produced in the reaction between sodium hydroxide and aluminium:

2 Al + 2 NaOH + 6 H 2 O → 2 Na[Al(OH)4] + 3 H 2
Unlike sodium hydroxide, which is soluble, the hydroxides of most transition metals are insoluble, and therefore sodium hydroxide can be used to [precipitate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precipitate "Precipitate") transition metal hydroxides. The following colours are observed:

*   Copper - blue
*   Iron(II) - green
*   Iron(III) - yellow / brown

Zinc and lead salts dissolve in excess sodium hydroxide to give a clear solution of Na 2 ZnO 2 or Na 2 PbO 2.

[Aluminium hydroxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium_hydroxide "Aluminium hydroxide") is used as a gelatinous [flocculant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flocculation#Flocculants "Flocculation") to filter out particulate matter in [water treatment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_treatment "Water treatment"). Aluminium hydroxide is prepared at the treatment plant from [aluminium sulfate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium_sulfate "Aluminium sulfate") by reacting it with sodium hydroxide or bicarbonate.

Al 2(SO 4)3 + 6 NaOH → 2 Al(OH)3 + 3 Na 2 SO 4 Al 2(SO 4)3 + 6 NaHCO 3 → 2 Al(OH)3 + 3 Na 2 SO 4 + 6 CO 2
Sodium hydroxide can be used for the base-driven [hydrolysis of esters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrolysis_of_esters "Hydrolysis of esters") (also called [saponification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saponification "Saponification")), [amides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amide "Amide") and [alkyl halides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkyl_halide "Alkyl halide").[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#cite_note-Protank-2018-16) However, the limited solubility of sodium hydroxide in organic solvents means that the more [soluble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soluble "Soluble")[potassium hydroxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium_hydroxide "Potassium hydroxide") (KOH) is often preferred. Touching a sodium hydroxide solution with bare hands, while not recommended, produces a slippery feeling. This happens because oils on the skin such as [sebum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebum "Sebum") are converted to soap. Despite solubility in [propylene glycol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propylene_glycol "Propylene glycol") it is unlikely to replace water in saponification due to propylene glycol's primary reaction with fat before reaction between sodium hydroxide and fat.

| Mass fraction of NaOH (wt%) | 4 | 10 | 20 | 30 | 40 | 50 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Molar concentration of NaOH (M) | 1.04 | 2.77 | 6.09 | 9.95 | 14.30 | 19.05 |
| Mass concentration of NaOH (g/L) | 41.7 | 110.9 | 243.8 | 398.3 | 572.0 | 762.2 |
| Density of solution (g/mL) | 1.043 | 1.109 | 1.219 | 1.328 | 1.430 | 1.524 |

Sodium hydroxide is industrially produced, first as a 32% solution, and then evaporated to a 50% solution by variations of the electrolytic [chloralkali process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloralkali_process "Chloralkali process").[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#cite_note-Du-26)[Chlorine gas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorine_gas "Chlorine gas") is the main product from this process.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#cite_note-epa2022-27)[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#cite_note-Du-26) Solid sodium hydroxide is obtained from this solution by the evaporation of water. Solid sodium hydroxide is most commonly sold as flakes, [prills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prill "Prill"), and cast blocks.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#cite_note-Ullmann-28)

In 2022, world production was estimated at 83 million dry tonnes of sodium hydroxide, and demand was estimated at 51 million tonnes.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#cite_note-Ullmann-28) In 1998, total world production was around 45 million [tonnes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne "Tonne"). North America and Asia each contributed around 14 million tonnes, while Europe produced around 10 million tonnes. In the United States, the major producer of sodium hydroxide is [Olin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olin_Corporation "Olin Corporation"), which has annual production around 5.7 million [tonnes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne "Tonne") from sites at [Freeport, Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeport,_Texas "Freeport, Texas"); [Plaquemine, Louisiana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaquemine,_Louisiana "Plaquemine, Louisiana"); [St. Gabriel, Louisiana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Gabriel,_Louisiana "St. Gabriel, Louisiana"); [McIntosh, Alabama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McIntosh,_Alabama "McIntosh, Alabama"); [Charleston, Tennessee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charleston,_Tennessee "Charleston, Tennessee"); [Niagara Falls, New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niagara_Falls,_New_York "Niagara Falls, New York"); and [Bécancour, Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9cancour,_Quebec "Bécancour, Quebec"). Other major US producers include [Oxychem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxychem "Oxychem"), [Westlake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPG_Industries "PPG Industries"), Shintek, and [Formosa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formosa_Plastics_Group "Formosa Plastics Group"). All of these companies use the [chloralkali process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloralkali_process "Chloralkali process").[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#cite_note-Kirk-29)

Historically, sodium hydroxide was produced by treating [sodium carbonate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_carbonate "Sodium carbonate") with [calcium hydroxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_hydroxide "Calcium hydroxide") (slaked lime) in a [metathesis reaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_metathesis_reaction "Salt metathesis reaction") which takes advantage of the fact that sodium hydroxide is soluble, while calcium carbonate is not. This process was called causticizing.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#cite_note-30)

Ca(OH)2(aq) + Na 2 CO 3(s) → CaCO 3(s) + 2 NaOH(aq)
The sodium carbonate for this reaction was produced by the [Leblanc process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leblanc_process "Leblanc process") in the early 19th century, or the [Solvay process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solvay_process "Solvay process") in the late 19th century. The conversion of sodium carbonate to sodium hydroxide was superseded entirely by the [chloralkali process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloralkali_process "Chloralkali process"), which produces sodium hydroxide in a single process.

Sodium hydroxide is also produced by combining pure sodium metal with water. The byproducts are hydrogen gas and heat, often resulting in a flame.

2 Na(s) + 2 H 2 O(l) → 2 NaOH(aq) + H 2(g)
This reaction is commonly used for demonstrating the reactivity of alkali metals in academic environments; however, it is not used commercially aside from a reaction within the [mercury cell chloralkali process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloralkali_process#Mercury_cell "Chloralkali process") where [sodium amalgam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_amalgam "Sodium amalgam") is reacted with water.

Sodium hydroxide is a popular strong [base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_(chemistry) "Base (chemistry)") used in industry. Sodium hydroxide is used in the manufacture of sodium salts and detergents, pH regulation, and organic synthesis. In bulk, it is most often handled as an [aqueous solution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqueous_solution "Aqueous solution"),[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#cite_note-31) since solutions are cheaper and easier to handle.

Sodium hydroxide is used in many scenarios where it is desirable to increase the [alkalinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkalinity "Alkalinity") of a mixture, or to neutralize acids. For example, in the petroleum industry, sodium hydroxide is used as an additive in [drilling mud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drilling_mud "Drilling mud") to increase [alkalinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkalinity "Alkalinity") in [bentonite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bentonite "Bentonite") mud systems, to increase the mud [viscosity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscosity "Viscosity"), and to neutralize any [acid gas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_gas "Acid gas") (such as [hydrogen sulfide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_sulfide "Hydrogen sulfide") and [carbon dioxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide "Carbon dioxide")) which may be encountered in the [geological formation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_formation "Geological formation") as drilling progresses. Another use is in [salt spray testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_spray_test "Salt spray test") where pH needs to be regulated. Sodium hydroxide is used with hydrochloric acid to balance pH. The resultant salt, NaCl, is the corrosive agent used in the standard neutral pH salt spray test.

Poor quality [crude oil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crude_oil "Crude oil") can be treated with sodium hydroxide to remove [sulfurous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfur "Sulfur") impurities in a process known as _caustic washing_. Sodium hydroxide reacts with weak acids such as [hydrogen sulfide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_sulfide "Hydrogen sulfide") and [mercaptans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercaptans "Mercaptans") to yield non-volatile sodium salts, which can be removed. The waste which is formed is toxic and difficult to deal with, and the process is banned in many countries because of this. In 2006, [Trafigura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trafigura "Trafigura") used the process and then [dumped the waste in Ivory Coast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_C%C3%B4te_d%27Ivoire_toxic_waste_dump "2006 Côte d'Ivoire toxic waste dump").[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#cite_note-Guardian-32)[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#cite_note-bbc-33)

Other common uses of sodium hydroxide include:

*   for making soaps and detergents. Sodium hydroxide is used for hard bar soap, while [potassium hydroxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium_hydroxide "Potassium hydroxide") is used for liquid soaps.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#cite_note-34)[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#cite_note-35) Sodium hydroxide is used more often than [potassium hydroxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium_hydroxide "Potassium hydroxide") because it is cheaper and a smaller quantity is needed.
*   as drain cleaners that convert pipe-clogging fats and grease into soap, which dissolves in water
*   for making artificial textile fibres such as [rayon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayon "Rayon")
*   in the manufacture of [paper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper "Paper"). Around 56% of sodium hydroxide produced is used by industry, 25% of which is used in the paper industry.
*   in purifying [bauxite ore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bauxite "Bauxite") from which [aluminium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium "Aluminium") metal is extracted. This is known as the [Bayer process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_process "Bayer process").
*   de-greasing metals
*   [oil refining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_refining "Oil refining")
*   making [dyes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dye "Dye") and [bleaches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleach "Bleach")
*   in water treatment plants for pH regulation
*   to treat bagels and pretzel dough, giving the distinctive shiny finish

Sodium hydroxide is also widely used in pulping of wood for making paper or regenerated fibers. Along with [sodium sulfide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_sulfide "Sodium sulfide"), sodium hydroxide is a key component of the white liquor solution used to separate [lignin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lignin "Lignin") from [cellulose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellulose "Cellulose")[fibers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber "Fiber") in the [kraft process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraft_process "Kraft process"). It also plays a key role in several later stages of the process of [bleaching the brown pulp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleaching_of_wood_pulp "Bleaching of wood pulp") resulting from the pulping process. These stages include [oxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen "Oxygen") delignification, [oxidative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidation "Oxidation") extraction, and simple extraction, all of which require a strong alkaline environment with a pH > 10.5 at the end of the stages.

In a similar fashion, sodium hydroxide is used to digest tissues, as in a process that was used with farm animals at one time. This process involved placing a carcass into a sealed chamber, then adding a mixture of sodium hydroxide and water (which breaks the chemical bonds that keep the flesh intact). This eventually turns the body into a liquid with a dark brown color,[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#cite_note-Ayres-36)[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#cite_note-carcassdisposal-37) and the only solids that remain are bone hulls, which can be crushed between one's fingertips.[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#cite_note-Roach-38)

Sodium hydroxide is frequently used in the process of decomposing [roadkill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roadkill "Roadkill") dumped in landfills by animal disposal contractors.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#cite_note-carcassdisposal-37) Due to its availability and low cost, it has been used by criminals to dispose of corpses. Italian [serial killer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_killer "Serial killer")[Leonarda Cianciulli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonarda_Cianciulli "Leonarda Cianciulli") used this chemical to turn dead bodies into soap.[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#cite_note-39) In Mexico, a man who worked for drug cartels admitted disposing of over 300 bodies with it.[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#cite_note-40)

Sodium hydroxide is a dangerous chemical due to its ability to hydrolyze protein. If a dilute solution is spilled on the skin, burns may result if the area is not washed thoroughly and for several minutes with running water. Splashes in the eye can be more serious and can lead to blindness.[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#cite_note-41)

### Dissolving amphoteric metals and compounds

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sodium_hydroxide&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Dissolving amphoteric metals and compounds")]

Strong bases attack [aluminium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium "Aluminium"). Sodium hydroxide reacts with aluminium and water to release hydrogen gas. The aluminium takes an oxygen atom from sodium hydroxide, which in turn takes an oxygen atom from water, and releases two hydrogen atoms. The reaction thus produces [hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen "Hydrogen") gas and [sodium aluminate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_aluminate "Sodium aluminate"). In this reaction, sodium hydroxide acts as an agent to make the solution alkaline, which aluminium can dissolve in.

2 Al + 2 NaOH + 2 H 2 O → 2 NaAlO 2 + 3 H 2
Sodium aluminate is an inorganic chemical that is used as an effective source of [aluminium hydroxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium_hydroxide "Aluminium hydroxide") for many industrial and technical applications. Pure sodium aluminate (anhydrous) is a white crystalline solid having a formula variously given as NaAlO 2, Na 3 AlO 3, Na[Al(OH)4], Na 2 O·Al 2 O 3 or Na 2 Al 2 O 4. Formation of sodium tetrahydroxoaluminate(III) or hydrated sodium aluminate is given by:[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#cite_note-42)

2 Al + 2 NaOH + 6 H 2 O → 2 Na[Al(OH)4] + 3 H 2
This reaction can be useful in [etching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etching "Etching"), removing anodizing, or converting a polished surface to a satin-like finish, but without further [passivation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passivation_(chemistry) "Passivation (chemistry)") such as [anodizing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anodizing "Anodizing") or [alodining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alodining "Alodining") the surface may become degraded, either under normal use or in severe atmospheric conditions.

In the [Bayer process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_process "Bayer process"), sodium hydroxide is used in the refining of alumina containing ores ([bauxite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bauxite "Bauxite")) to produce alumina ([aluminium oxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium_oxide "Aluminium oxide")) which is the raw material used to produce aluminium via the [electrolytic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolysis "Electrolysis")[Hall-Héroult process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall-H%C3%A9roult_process "Hall-Héroult process"). Since the alumina is [amphoteric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphoteric "Amphoteric"), it dissolves in the sodium hydroxide, leaving impurities less soluble at high [pH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH "PH") such as [iron oxides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_oxides "Iron oxides") behind in the form of a highly alkaline [red mud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_mud "Red mud").

Other amphoteric metals are zinc and lead which dissolve in concentrated sodium hydroxide solutions to give [sodium zincate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_zincate "Sodium zincate") and [sodium plumbate](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sodium_plumbate&action=edit&redlink=1 "Sodium plumbate (page does not exist)") respectively.

### Esterification and transesterification reagent

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sodium_hydroxide&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Esterification and transesterification reagent")]

Sodium hydroxide is traditionally used in soap making ([cold process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_process "Cold process") soap, [saponification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saponification "Saponification")).[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#cite_note-Morfit-43) It was made in the nineteenth century for a hard surface rather than liquid product because it was easier to store and transport.

For the manufacture of [biodiesel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiesel "Biodiesel"), sodium hydroxide is used as a [catalyst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalyst "Catalyst") for the [transesterification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transesterification "Transesterification") of methanol and triglycerides. This only works with [anhydrous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anhydrous "Anhydrous") sodium hydroxide, because combined with water the fat would turn into [soap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soap "Soap"), which would be tainted with [methanol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methanol "Methanol"). NaOH is used more often than [potassium hydroxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium_hydroxide "Potassium hydroxide") because it is cheaper and a smaller quantity is needed. Due to production costs, NaOH, which is produced using common salt is cheaper than potassium hydroxide.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#cite_note-44)

### Skincare ingredient

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sodium_hydroxide&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Skincare ingredient")]

Sodium hydroxide is an ingredient used in some [skin care](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_care "Skin care") and [cosmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmetics "Cosmetics") products, such as facial cleansers, creams, lotions, and makeup. It is typically used in low concentration as a [pH balancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH "PH"), due its highly alkaline nature.[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#cite_note-45)

Food uses of sodium hydroxide include washing or chemical peeling of [fruits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruits "Fruits") and [vegetables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetables "Vegetables"), [chocolate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chocolate "Chocolate") and [cocoa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocoa_mass "Cocoa mass") processing, [caramel coloring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caramel_coloring "Caramel coloring") production, [poultry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry "Poultry") scalding, [soft drink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_drink "Soft drink") processing, and thickening [ice cream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_cream "Ice cream").[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#cite_note-46)[Olives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olive "Olive") are often soaked in sodium hydroxide for softening; [pretzels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretzel "Pretzel") and German [lye rolls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lye_roll "Lye roll") are glazed with a sodium hydroxide solution before baking to make them crisp. Owing to the difficulty in obtaining food grade sodium hydroxide in small quantities for home use, [sodium carbonate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_carbonate "Sodium carbonate") is often used in place of sodium hydroxide.[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#cite_note-Hominy-47) It is known as [E number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_number "E number") E524.

Specific foods processed with sodium hydroxide include:

*   German [pretzels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretzel "Pretzel") are poached in a boiling [sodium carbonate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_carbonate "Sodium carbonate") solution or cold sodium hydroxide solution before baking, which contributes to their unique crust.
*   Lye water is an essential ingredient in the crust of the traditional baked Chinese moon cakes.
*   Most yellow coloured [Chinese noodles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_noodles "Chinese noodles") are made with lye water but are commonly mistaken for containing egg.
*   One variety of [zongzi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zongzi "Zongzi") uses lye water to impart a sweet flavor.
*   Sodium hydroxide causes gelling of egg whites in the production of [century eggs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_egg "Century egg").
*   Some methods of preparing olives involve subjecting them to a lye-based brine.[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#cite_note-48)
*   The Filipino dessert ([Filipino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filipino_language "Filipino language"): _kakanin_) called _[kutsinta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kutsinta "Kutsinta")_ uses a small quantity of lye water to help give the rice flour batter a jelly-like consistency. A similar process is also used in the kakanin known as _[pitsi-pitsi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitsi-pitsi "Pitsi-pitsi")_ or _pichi-pichi_ except that the mixture uses grated [cassava](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassava "Cassava") instead of rice flour.
*   The [Norwegian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway "Norway") dish known as [lutefisk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lutefisk "Lutefisk") ([Norwegian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_language "Norwegian language"): _lutfisk_, [lit.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literal_translation "Literal translation")'lye fish').
*   [Bagels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagel "Bagel") are often boiled in a lye solution before baking, contributing to their shiny crust.
*   [Hominy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hominy "Hominy") is dried [maize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maize "Maize") (corn) kernels reconstituted by soaking in lye-water. These expand considerably in size and may be further processed by frying to make [corn nuts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corn_nuts "Corn nuts") or by drying and grinding to make [grits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grits "Grits"). Hominy is used to create [masa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masa "Masa"), a popular flour used in Mexican cuisine to make [corn tortillas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corn_tortillas "Corn tortillas") and [tamales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamales "Tamales"). [Nixtamal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixtamal "Nixtamal") is similar, but uses [calcium hydroxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_hydroxide "Calcium hydroxide") instead of sodium hydroxide.

Sodium hydroxide is frequently used as an industrial [cleaning agent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleaning_agent "Cleaning agent") where it is often called "caustic". It is added to water, heated, and then used to clean process equipment, storage tanks, etc. It can dissolve [grease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grease_(lubricant) "Grease (lubricant)"), [oils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oils "Oils"), [fats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat "Fat") and [protein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein "Protein")-based deposits. It is also used for cleaning waste discharge pipes under sinks and drains in domestic properties. [Surfactants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surfactants "Surfactants") can be added to the sodium hydroxide solution in order to stabilize dissolved substances and thus prevent redeposition. A sodium hydroxide soak solution is used as a powerful degreaser on [stainless steel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stainless_steel "Stainless steel") and glass bakeware. It is also a common ingredient in oven cleaners.

A common use of sodium hydroxide is in the production of [parts washer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parts_washer "Parts washer")[detergents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detergent "Detergent"). Parts washer detergents based on sodium hydroxide are some of the most aggressive parts washer cleaning chemicals. The sodium hydroxide-based detergents include surfactants, rust inhibitors and defoamers. A parts washer heats water and the detergent in a closed cabinet and then sprays the heated sodium hydroxide and hot water at pressure against dirty parts for degreasing applications. Sodium hydroxide used in this manner replaced many solvent-based systems in the early 1990s[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] when [trichloroethane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1,1,1-Trichloroethane "1,1,1-Trichloroethane") was outlawed by the [Montreal Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal_Protocol "Montreal Protocol"). Water and sodium hydroxide detergent-based parts washers are considered to be an environmental improvement over the solvent-based cleaning methods.

[Hardware stores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_store "Hardware store") grade sodium hydroxide to be used as a type of [drain cleaner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_drain_cleaners#Alkaline_drain_openers "Chemical drain cleaners").

Sodium hydroxide is used in the home as a type of [drain openers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_drain_cleaners#Alkaline_drain_openers "Chemical drain cleaners") to unblock clogged drains, usually in the form of a dry crystal or as a thick liquid gel. The alkali reacts with [greases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat "Fat") to produce [water soluble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_soluble "Water soluble") soap and [glycerol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycerol "Glycerol"). It also [hydrolyzes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrolysis "Hydrolysis")[proteins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteins "Proteins"), such as those found in [hair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair "Hair"), which may block waste water pipes. Dissolving sodium hydroxide in water is an [exothermic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exothermic "Exothermic") reaction producing considerable quantities of heat which assists in speeding up the reactions with grease and other organic matter. Such [alkaline drain cleaners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_drain_cleaners#Alkaline_drain_openers "Chemical drain cleaners") and their [acidic versions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_drain_cleaners#Acidic_drain_openers "Chemical drain cleaners") are highly [corrosive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrosive "Corrosive") and should be handled with great caution.

Sodium hydroxide is used in some [relaxers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relaxer "Relaxer") to [straighten hair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straighten_hair "Straighten hair"). However, because of the high incidence and intensity of chemical burns, manufacturers of chemical relaxers use other alkaline chemicals in preparations available to consumers. Sodium hydroxide relaxers are still available, but they are used mostly by professionals.

A solution of sodium hydroxide in water was traditionally used as the most common paint stripper on wooden objects. Its use has become less common, because it can damage the wood surface, raising the grain and staining the colour.

Sodium hydroxide is sometimes used during [water purification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_purification "Water purification") to raise the pH of water supplies. Increased pH makes the water less corrosive to plumbing and reduces the amount of lead, copper and other toxic metals that can dissolve into drinking water.[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#cite_note-49)[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#cite_note-50)

Sodium hydroxide has been used for detection of [carbon monoxide poisoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide_poisoning "Carbon monoxide poisoning"), with blood samples of such patients turning to a [vermilion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermilion "Vermilion") color upon the addition of a few drops of sodium hydroxide.[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#cite_note-51) Today, carbon monoxide poisoning can be detected by [CO oximetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CO_oximetry "CO oximetry").

### In cement mixes, mortars, concrete, grouts

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sodium_hydroxide&action=edit&section=25 "Edit section: In cement mixes, mortars, concrete, grouts")]

Sodium hydroxide is used in some cement mix plasticisers. This helps homogenise cement mixes, preventing segregation of sands and cement, decreases the amount of water required in a mix and increases workability of the cement product, be it mortar, render or concrete.

[![Image 20](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Sodium_hydroxide_burn.png/250px-Sodium_hydroxide_burn.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sodium_hydroxide_burn.png)

[Chemical burns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_burn "Chemical burn") caused by sodium hydroxide solution photographed 44 hours after exposure.

Like other [corrosive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrosive "Corrosive")[acids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid "Acid") and [alkalis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkali "Alkali"), a few drops of sodium hydroxide solutions can readily decompose [proteins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteins "Proteins") and [lipids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipids "Lipids") in [living tissues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology) "Tissue (biology)") via [amide hydrolysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amide_hydrolysis "Amide hydrolysis") and [ester hydrolysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ester_hydrolysis "Ester hydrolysis"), which consequently cause [chemical burns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_burn "Chemical burn") and may induce permanent [blindness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindness "Blindness") upon contact with eyes.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#cite_note-msd-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#cite_note-msd2-2) Solid alkali can also express its corrosive nature if there is water, such as water vapor. Thus, [protective equipment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protective_equipment "Protective equipment"), like [rubber gloves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_gloves "Rubber gloves"), [safety clothing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_clothing "Safety clothing") and [eye protection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_protection "Eye protection"), should always be used when handling this chemical or its solutions. The standard first aid measures for alkali spills on the skin is, as for other corrosives, irrigation with large quantities of water. Washing is continued for at least ten to fifteen minutes.

Moreover, [dissolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solvation "Solvation") of sodium hydroxide is highly [exothermic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exothermic "Exothermic"), and the resulting heat may cause heat burns or ignite flammables. It also produces heat when reacted with acids.

Sodium hydroxide is mildly corrosive to [glass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass "Glass"), which can cause damage to [glazing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glazing_(window) "Glazing (window)") or cause [ground glass joints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_glass_joint "Ground glass joint") to bind.[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#cite_note-52) Sodium hydroxide is corrosive to several metals, like [aluminium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium "Aluminium") which reacts with the alkali to produce flammable [hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen "Hydrogen") gas on contact.[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#cite_note-53)

Sodium hydroxide's toxicity level for fish etc. is around 20—200 mg/L and is associated with increased pH value. However as it is quickly neutralized and does not accumulate, its effect on the environment is usually easily handled.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#cite_note-echa-54)

Careful storage is needed when handling sodium hydroxide for use, especially bulk volumes. Following proper NaOH storage guidelines and maintaining worker/environment safety is always recommended given the chemical's burn hazard.

Sodium hydroxide is often stored in bottles for small-scale laboratory use, within [intermediate bulk containers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_bulk_container "Intermediate bulk container") (medium volume containers) for cargo handling and transport, or within large stationary storage tanks with volumes up to 100,000 gallons for manufacturing or waste water plants with extensive NaOH use. Common materials that are compatible with sodium hydroxide and often utilized for NaOH storage include: polyethylene ([HDPE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDPE "HDPE"), usual, [XLPE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-linked_polyethylene "Cross-linked polyethylene"), less common), [carbon steel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_steel "Carbon steel"), [polyvinyl chloride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyvinyl_chloride "Polyvinyl chloride") (PVC), [stainless steel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stainless_steel "Stainless steel"), and [fiberglass reinforced plastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiberglass_reinforced_plastic "Fiberglass reinforced plastic") (FRP, with a resistant liner).[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#cite_note-Protank-2018-16)

Sodium hydroxide must be stored in airtight containers to preserve its [normality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalent_concentration "Equivalent concentration") as it will absorb water and carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

Sodium hydroxide was first prepared by soap makers.[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#cite_note-thorpe-55): p45  A procedure for making sodium hydroxide appeared as part of a recipe for making soap in an Arab book of the late 13th century: _Al-mukhtara' fi funun min al-suna'_ (Inventions from the Various Industrial Arts), which was compiled by al-Muzaffar Yusuf ibn 'Umar ibn 'Ali ibn Rasul (d. 1295), a king of [Yemen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen "Yemen").[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#cite_note-56)[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#cite_note-57)

The recipe called for passing water repeatedly through a mixture of _[alkali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkali "Alkali")_ (Arabic: _al-qily_, where _qily_ is ash from [saltwort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasswort "Glasswort") plants, which are rich in sodium; hence _alkali_ was impure [sodium carbonate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_carbonate "Sodium carbonate"))[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#cite_note-58) and quicklime ([calcium oxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_oxide "Calcium oxide"), CaO), whereby a solution of sodium hydroxide was obtained. European soap makers also followed this recipe. When in 1791 the French chemist and surgeon [Nicolas Leblanc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Leblanc "Nicolas Leblanc") (1742–1806) patented a [process for mass-producing sodium carbonate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leblanc_process "Leblanc process"), natural "soda ash" (impure sodium carbonate that was obtained from the ashes of plants that are rich in sodium)[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#cite_note-thorpe-55): p36  was replaced by this artificial version.[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#cite_note-thorpe-55): p46  However, by the 20th century, the [electrolysis of sodium chloride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloralkali_process "Chloralkali process") had become the primary method for producing sodium hydroxide.[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide#cite_note-59)
