Harvard competes as a member of the ECAC Conference and plays its home games at the Bright Hockey Center in Boston, Massachusetts .

History [ edit ] The Harvard Crimson "iced" its first regular season women's hockey team in the 1978–79 season. Their first game was a 17–0 defeat at the hands of the Providence Friars women's ice hockey program. The next game was a 2–1 loss to the Yale Bulldogs women's ice hockey program.

[ 1 ] In 1998–99, the Crimson finished with a record of 33–1. Of the 31 wins, the Crimson won 30 consecutive games to close the season.

[ 2 ] In the previous season, the Crimson went 14–16–0. The final game of that 30 game streak was a 6–5 overtime victory over the New Hampshire Wildcats women's ice hockey program in the American Women's College Hockey Alliance (AWCHA) national championship game. During the season, the Crimson would win the Beanpot and Ivy League title. In addition, the Crimson won their first ECAC regular-season and tournament championships. This would be Katey Stone's first AWCHA national championship.

[ 2 ] In 2001, Harvard participated in the inaugural NCAA Championship tournament. On January 18, 2003, Harvard beat the Boston College Eagles women's ice hockey program by a 17–2 mark, the largest margin of victory in NCAA history.

[ 3 ] Jennifer Botterill set an NCAA record (since tied) for most points in one game with 10. This was accomplished on January 28, 2003 versus Boston College.

[ 3 ] A few months later, Nicole Corriero tied Botterill's record for most points in one NCAA game with ten. She accomplished the feat on November 7, 2003 versus the Union Dutchwomen.

[ 3 ] In addition, she holds the NCAA record for most game winning goals in a career with 27. During the 2003–04 season, Nicole Corriero would set an NCAA record with 59 goals scored in a season.

[ 4 ] On February 26, 2010, head coach Katey Stone became the women’s college hockey all-time wins leader, surpassing former University of Minnesota head coach Laura Halldorson.

[ 5 ] Laura Bellamy became the Crimson's head coach in August 2023 following Stone's retirement in the aftermath of a hazing and abuse scandal .
