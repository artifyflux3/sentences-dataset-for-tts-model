They are a subset of sigma complexes .

[ 1 ] The prototypical complex is W(CO) 3 ( PCy 3 ) 2 (H 2 ). This class of compounds represent intermediates in metal-catalyzed reactions involving hydrogen . Hundreds of dihydrogen complexes have been reported. Most examples are cationic transition metals complexes with octahedral geometry .

Upon complexation, the H−H bond is extended to 0.81–0.82 Å as indicated by neutron diffraction , about a 10% extension relative to the H−H bond in free H 2 . Some complexes containing multiple hydrogen ligands, i.e. polyhydrides, also exhibit short H−H contacts. It has been suggested that distances < 1.00 Å indicates significant dihydrogen character, where separations > 1 Å are better described as dihydride complexes (see figure).

Characterization [ edit ] An often studied dihydrogen complex of iron, [HFe(H 2 )(dppe) 2 ] + .

The usual method for characterization is 1 H NMR spectroscopy . The magnitude of spin–spin coupling , J HD , is a useful indicator of the strength of the bond between the hydrogen and deuterium in HD complexes. For example, J HD is 43.2 Hz in HD but 33.5 Hz in W(HD)(CO) 3 (P i Pr 3 ) 2 . Dihydrogen complexes typically have shorter 1 H-spin-lattice relaxation times than the corresponding dihydrides.

[ 2 ] An ideal if nontrivial method of characterization of dihydrogen complexes is neutron diffraction .

Neutrons interact strongly with hydrogen atoms, which allows one to infer their location in a crystal. In some cases, hydrogen ligands are usefully characterized by X-ray crystallography , but often the presence of metals, which strongly scatter X-rays , complicates the analysis.

The triangular MH 2 subunit has six normal modes of vibration, one of which is mainly of ν H−H character. In free H 2 , this very strong bond absorbs at 4300 cm −1 , whereas in dihydrogen complexes the frequency drops to around 2800 cm −1 .

Synthesis [ edit ] Two preparation methods involve the direct reactions with H 2 gas. The first entails the addition of H 2 to an unsaturated metal center, as originally reported for W(CO) 3 (P-i-Pr 3 ) 2 (H 2 ). In such cases, the unsaturated complex in fact features an agostic interaction that is displaced by the H 2 .

In other cases, H 2 will displace anionic ligands, sometimes even halides. Treatment of chlorobis(dppe)iron hydride with sodium tetrafluorborate under an atmosphere of hydrogen is one example: [ 3 ] HFeCl(dppe) 2 + NaBF 4 + H 2 → [HFe(H 2 )(dppe) 2 ][BF 4 ] + NaCl Many metal hydrides can be protonated to give dihydrogen complexes: [ 4 ] H 2 Fe(dppe) 2 + H + → [HFe(H 2 )(dppe) 2 ] + In such cases, the acid usually is derived from a weakly coordinating anion , e.g., Brookhart's acid .

History [ edit ] In 1984, Kubas et al. discovered that the addition of H 2 to the purple-colored species M(CO) 3 (PR 3 ) 2 gave a yellow precipitate of mer-trans-M(CO) 3 (PR 3 ) 2 (H 2 ) (M = Mo or W; R = cyclohexyl, iso-propyl).

[ 5 ] This result rapidly led to the discovery of a variety of related complexes such as Cr(H 2 )(CO) 5 [ 6 ] and [Fe(H 2 )(H)( dppe ) 2 ] + .

[ 7 ] Kubas et al.'s findings also led to a reevaluation of previously described compounds. For example, the complex "RuH 4 ( PPh 3 ) 3 " described in 1968 was reformulated as a dihydrogen complex.
