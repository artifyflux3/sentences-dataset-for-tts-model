In mathematics , a binary function (also called bivariate function , or function of two variables ) is a function that takes two inputs.

Precisely stated, a function f {\displaystyle f} is binary if there exists sets X , Y , Z {\displaystyle X,Y,Z} such that f : : X × × Y → → Z {\displaystyle \,f\colon X\times Y\rightarrow Z} where X × × Y {\displaystyle X\times Y} is the Cartesian product of X {\displaystyle X} and Y .

{\displaystyle Y.} Alternative definitions [ edit ] Set-theoretically , a binary function can be represented as a subset of the Cartesian product X × × Y × × Z {\displaystyle X\times Y\times Z} , where ( x , y , z ) {\displaystyle (x,y,z)} belongs to the subset if and only if f ( x , y ) = z {\displaystyle f(x,y)=z} .
Conversely, a subset R {\displaystyle R} defines a binary function if and only if for any x ∈ ∈ X {\displaystyle x\in X} and y ∈ ∈ Y {\displaystyle y\in Y} , there exists a unique z ∈ ∈ Z {\displaystyle z\in Z} such that ( x , y , z ) {\displaystyle (x,y,z)} belongs to R {\displaystyle R} .

f ( x , y ) {\displaystyle f(x,y)} is then defined to be this z {\displaystyle z} .

Alternatively, a binary function may be interpreted as simply a function from X × × Y {\displaystyle X\times Y} to Z {\displaystyle Z} .
Even when thought of this way, however, one generally writes f ( x , y ) {\displaystyle f(x,y)} instead of f ( ( x , y ) ) {\displaystyle f((x,y))} .
(That is, the same pair of parentheses is used to indicate both function application and the formation of an ordered pair .) Examples [ edit ] Division of whole numbers can be thought of as a function. If Z {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} } is the set of integers , N + {\displaystyle \mathbb {N} ^{+}} is the set of natural numbers (except for zero), and Q {\displaystyle \mathbb {Q} } is the set of rational numbers , then division is a binary function f : Z × × N + → → Q {\displaystyle f:\mathbb {Z} \times \mathbb {N} ^{+}\to \mathbb {Q} } .

In a vector space V over a field F , scalar multiplication is a binary function. A scalar a ∈ F is combined with a vector v ∈ V to produce a new vector av ∈ V .

Another example is that of inner products, or more generally functions of the form ( x , y ) ↦ ↦ x T M y {\displaystyle (x,y)\mapsto x^{\mathrm {T} }My} , where x , y are real-valued vectors of appropriate size and M is a matrix. If M is a positive definite matrix , this yields an inner product .

[ 1 ] Functions of two real variables [ edit ] Functions whose domain is a subset of R 2 {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{2}} are often also called functions of two variables even if their domain does not form a rectangle and thus the cartesian product of two sets.

[ 2 ] Restrictions to ordinary functions [ edit ] In turn, one can also derive ordinary functions of one variable from a binary function.
Given any element x ∈ ∈ X {\displaystyle x\in X} , there is a function f x {\displaystyle f^{x}} , or f ( x , ⋅ ⋅ ) {\displaystyle f(x,\cdot )} , from Y {\displaystyle Y} to Z {\displaystyle Z} , given by f x ( y ) = f ( x , y ) {\displaystyle f^{x}(y)=f(x,y)} .
Similarly, given any element y ∈ ∈ Y {\displaystyle y\in Y} , there is a function f y {\displaystyle f_{y}} , or f ( ⋅ ⋅ , y ) {\displaystyle f(\cdot ,y)} , from X {\displaystyle X} to Z {\displaystyle Z} , given by f y ( x ) = f ( x , y ) {\displaystyle f_{y}(x)=f(x,y)} . In computer science, this identification between a function from X × × Y {\displaystyle X\times Y} to Z {\displaystyle Z} and a function from X {\displaystyle X} to Z Y {\displaystyle Z^{Y}} , where Z Y {\displaystyle Z^{Y}} is the set of all functions from Y {\displaystyle Y} to Z {\displaystyle Z} , is called currying .

Generalisations [ edit ] The various concepts relating to functions can also be generalised to binary functions.
For example, the division example above is surjective (or onto ) because every rational number may be expressed as a quotient of an integer and a natural number.
This example is injective in each input separately, because the functions f x and f y are always injective.
However, it's not injective in both variables simultaneously, because (for example) f (2,4) = f (1,2).

One can also consider partial binary functions, which may be defined only for certain values of the inputs.
For example, the division example above may also be interpreted as a partial binary function from Z and N to Q , where N is the set of all natural numbers, including zero.
But this function is undefined when the second input is zero.

A binary operation is a binary function where the sets X , Y , and Z are all equal; binary operations are often used to define algebraic structures .

In linear algebra , a bilinear transformation is a binary function where the sets X , Y , and Z are all vector spaces and the derived functions f x and f y are all linear transformations .
A bilinear transformation, like any binary function, can be interpreted as a function from X × Y to Z , but this function in general won't be linear.
However, the bilinear transformation can also be interpreted as a single linear transformation from the tensor product X ⊗ ⊗ Y {\displaystyle X\otimes Y} to Z .

Generalisations to ternary and other functions [ edit ] See also: Multivariate function The concept of binary function generalises to ternary (or 3-ary ) function , quaternary (or 4-ary ) function , or more generally to n-ary function for any natural number n .
A 0-ary function to Z is simply given by an element of Z .
One can also define an A-ary function where A is any set ; there is one input for each element of A .

Category theory [ edit ] In category theory , n -ary functions generalise to n -ary morphisms in a multicategory .
The interpretation of an n -ary morphism as an ordinary morphisms whose domain is some sort of product of the domains of the original n -ary morphism will work in a monoidal category .
The construction of the derived morphisms of one variable will work in a closed monoidal category .
The category of sets is closed monoidal, but so is the category of vector spaces, giving the notion of bilinear transformation above.
