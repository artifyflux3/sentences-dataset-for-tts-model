[ 19 ] Ordnance Element [ edit ] ANZUK Ordnance Depot: [ 20 ] [ 21 ] To support the Land Army component of the ANZUK Force, the ANZUK Ordnance Depot was established from the existing Australian/New Zealand 5 Advanced Ordnance Depot . Located in the premises vacated by the Royal Navy Victualling Depot on the dockside at Sembawang Naval Base.

Disbandment [ edit ] By 1973 the political climate in Australia and the United Kingdom had changed and it was deemed that ANZUK should be disbanded. Rear Admiral Wells, [ 22 ] the First ANZUK commander who established the Force, had the task of planning the run-down phase and handing over to his successor Air Vice Marshal Richard Gordon Wakeford , [ 23 ] to follow through.

Australia would be retaining a presence in Butterworth in Malaysia [ 24 ] and the United Kingdom had decided to withdraw all its forces east of Suez .

[ 25 ] [ 26 ] It was in New Zealand's interest to retain a force in southeast Asia, so on 30 January 1974 New Zealand Force South East Asia was formed, [ 27 ] taking under its command all the New Zealand units formerly part of ANZUK.

Over the course of 1974 the integrated units which made up the ANZUK were gradually disbanded and replaced by national units. On 31 January 1974 ceased to exist, followed on  16 December 1974 with the disbanding of the Naval and Air Headquarters and their assets reverted to their respective national command and what remained of the United Kingdom's land component forces became the 28th (UK) Infantry Brigade .

Taking several years for the Australian and United Kingdom units to draw down and withdraw, it was not until 1977 that NZFORSEA was the sole remaining foreign presence in Singapore.
