A shiviti from Denmark, with Hebrew text in the shape of a menorah .

Micrography (from Greek , literally small-writing – "Μικρογραφία"), also called microcalligraphy , is a Jewish form of calligrams developed in the 9th century, with parallels in Christianity and Islam, [ 1 ] utilizing minute Hebrew letters to form representational, geometric and abstract designs. Colored micrography is especially distinctive because these rare artworks are customarily rendered in black and white.

Description [ edit ] The artwork is created from text that forms an image when viewed at a distance, creating an interplay between the text and image. The photomosaic , whose tiny individual images form a mosaic when viewed from a distance, is a modern analogue. Another modern analogue is ASCII art , where ASCII or extended ASCII characters are arranged to form an image on a computer screen and/or printout.

Motivation [ edit ] See also: Calligram An Arabic calligram in the form of a peacock.

There is a relationship between this form of art, employing both digital and analogic symbols, and the restrictions on images found in the second commandment . Micrography provides a unique solution to the visual artist who wishes to remain devout in observation of Jewish law , by using only text, not images per se. As similar restrictions exist in certain Muslim societies, this solution has been adapted in Islamic calligraphy to the Arabic alphabet as well.
