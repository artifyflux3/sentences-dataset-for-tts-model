portal v t e This is a list of republics . For antiquity (or later in the case of societies that did not refer to modern terminology to qualify their form of government ) the assessment of whether a state organisation is a republic is based on retrospective analysis by historians and political theorists. For more recent systems of government, worldwide organisations with a broad political acceptance (such as the United Nations ), can provide information on whether or not a sovereign state is referred to as a republic.
