Strunz , Mineralogische Tabellen 1948–1959 – Felix Andries Vening Meinesz investigations show gravity anomalies, implying that the crust is moving (together with J.H.F. Umbgrove , B.G. Escher and Ph.H. Kuenen ) 1951 – Alfred Rittmann links subduction , volcanism and the Wadati–Benioff zone 1953 – Maurice Ewing , Bruce Heezen , and Marie Tharp discover the Great Global Rift running along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge 1960 – Harry Hess proposes that new sea floor might be created at mid-ocean rifts and destroyed at deep sea trenches 1963 – Frederick Vine and Drummond Matthews explain the stripes of magnetized rocks with alternating magnetic polarities running parallel to mid-ocean ridges as due to sea floor spreading and the periodic geomagnetic field reversals ( Vine–Matthews–Morley hypothesis ) 1966 – Keiiti Aki discovers the seismic moment ( M 0 {\displaystyle M_{0}} ) 1979 – Thomas C. Hanks and Hiroo Kanamori , Moment magnitude scale ( M W {\displaystyle M_{W}} ), it succeeds the Richter magnitude scale 1980 – Physicist Luis Alvarez , his son, geologist Walter Alvarez , and others propose that the impact of a large extraterrestrial object caused the extinction of the dinosaurs at the end of the Cretaceous Period , about 66 million years ago.
