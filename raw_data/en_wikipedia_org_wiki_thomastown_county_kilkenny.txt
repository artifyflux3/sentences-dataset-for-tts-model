It is from FitzAnthony that Thomastown was named.

[ 10 ] FitzAnthony was granted a large area of land in the region by William Earl Marshall , son-in-law of Strongbow , and became the Seneschal (Governor) of Leinster in the 13th century.

[ 11 ] He built fortifications at Thomastown, fragments of which can still be seen today, together with nearby Grennan Castle, now in ruins. FitzAnthony died in 1229. Of this castle and the town's walls, the only remains are the towers near each end of the bridge and the remains of a 13th-century church, dedicated to St Mary.  
The town thrived and had more than 200 burgesses at the end of the 13th century. Thomastown became a small medieval walled town: the first walls were built in 1449.

[ 12 ] Edward III (twice), Henry VI, Mary I, James I, and James II granted the town royal charters. Under a 1553 charter from Queen Mary I, the burgesses of Thomastown had the right to choose two members of Parliament, a practice they continued until the Acts of Union in 1800.

[ 13 ] In 1650 the town was attacked by Oliver Cromwell . Grennan Castle was laid siege to by Cromwell's army and after two days the defending forces surrendered.

[ 12 ] Tomb of St. Nicholas Local tradition holds that the remains of Saint Nicholas , the 3rd century Anatolian bishop , lie in the vicinity of Thomastown in Jerpoint Park. A grave slab with the carved heads of three people at the ruined Church of St. Nicholas, the church itself, and other stones are virtually all that remain of the medieval village of Newtown Jerpoint, which had fallen into ruin by the 17th century. The village of Newtown was adjacent to Jerpoint Abbey, founded in 1183. The abbey had its own gardens, watermills, cemetery, granary, and kitchens, and was home to a group of Irish-Norman Crusaders in the Middle Ages. It was dissolved in 1540. The legend refers to a band of Irish-Norman knights from Jerpoint, who travelled to the Holy Land to take part in the Crusades. On their return to County Kilkenny, it is said they brought St. Nicholas' remains.

Landmarks [ edit ] Grennan Castle Kilfane Glen is a restored historic 1790s garden with a waterfall, woodland walks and cottage orné . The garden is listed as an Irish Heritage Garden, and was awarded assistance in 1993 by the European Union Cultural Commission.

The landscape within the demesne of Kilfane House was developed during the 1790s by the then landowner and his wife, Sir John and Lady Power. Sir Richard Power, twin brother of Sir John also joined in the development of the garden.

The ruins of the 12th century Jerpoint Abbey is located near the town.

The nearby Grennan Castle, an oblong-shaped castle, dates from the 13th century and was erected by Thomas FitzAnthony. The castle was in good repair until the beginning of the 19th century, when parts of it were removed for building purposes.

[ 12 ] Industry [ edit ] River Nore at Thomastown.

Milling, with mills powered by the waters of the River Nore , was the principal industry in the town until the early 1960s. The mills were Pilsworth's Mills. At one stage there were 12 water-powered mills, for grain and cloth, working in the parish. The last working mill in Thomastown closed in 1963. This mill is now the site of Grennan Mill Craft School.

[ 14 ] Several mill buildings in good condition can be seen upstream from the bridge.

[ 12 ] For centuries there was an important boat trade to carry produce to and from the port of New Ross. It went into decline at the end of the 18th century.
