In the Greek numeric system / isopsephy ( gematria ), it has a value of 800. The name of the letter was originally ὦ ( ō̂ [ɔ̂ː] ), but it was later changed to ὦ μέγα ( ō̂ méga 'big o') in the Middle Ages to distinguish it from omicron ⟨ ο ⟩ , whose name means 'small o', as both letters had come to be pronounced [o] .

[ 2 ] In modern Greek , its name has fused into ωμέγα ( oméga ).

In phonetic terms, the Ancient Greek Ω represented a long open-mid back rounded vowel [ɔː] , in contrast to omicron , which represented the close-mid back rounded vowel [o] , and the digraph ⟨ ου ⟩ , which represented the long close back rounded vowel [uː] . In modern Greek , both omega and omicron represent the mid back rounded vowel [o̞] . The letter omega is transliterated into a Latin-script alphabet as ō or simply o .

As the final letter in the Greek alphabet, omega is often used to denote the last, the end, or the ultimate limit of a set , in contrast to alpha , the first letter of the Greek alphabet; see Alpha and Omega .

History [ edit ] Ω was not part of the early (8th century BC) Greek alphabets . It was introduced in the late 7th century BC in the Ionian cities of Asia Minor to denote a long open-mid back rounded vowel [ɔː] . It is a variant of omicron (Ο), broken up at the side ( ), with the edges subsequently turned outward ( , , , ).

[ 3 ] The Dorian city of Knidos as well as a few Aegean islands, namely Paros , Thasos and Melos , chose the exact opposite innovation, using a broken-up circle for the short and a closed circle for the long /o/ .

[ 3 ] The name Ωμέγα is Byzantine ; in Classical Greek , the letter was called ō ( ὦ ) (pronounced /ɔ̂ː/), whereas the omicron was called ou ( οὖ ) (pronounced /ôː/).

[ 4 ] The modern lowercase shape goes back to the uncial form , a form that developed during the 3rd century BC in ancient handwriting on papyrus, from a flattened-out form of the letter ( ) that had its edges curved even further upward.

[ 5 ] In addition to the Greek alphabet, Omega was also adopted into the early Cyrillic alphabet (see Cyrillic omega (Ѡ, ѡ)). A Raetic variant is conjectured to be at the origin or parallel evolution of the Elder Futhark ᛟ .

Omega was also adopted into the Latin alphabet, as a letter of the 1982 revision to the African reference alphabet . It's in sparse use (see Latin omega ).
