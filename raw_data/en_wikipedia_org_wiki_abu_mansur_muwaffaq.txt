( October 2021 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Abū Manṣūr Muwaffaq Harawī ( Arabic / Persian : أبو منصور موفق هروي ) was a 10th-century Persian physician .

[ 1 ] He flourished in Herat (modern-day Afghanistan), under the Samanid prince Mansur I , who ruled from 961 to 976.

He was apparently the first to think of compiling a treatise on materia medica in Persian; he travelled extensively in Persia and India to obtain the necessary information.

Abu Mansur distinguished between sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate , and seems to have had some knowledge about arsenious oxide , cupric oxide , silicic acid , and antimony ; he knew the toxicological effects of copper and lead compounds, the depilatory vertue of quicklime , the composition of plaster of Paris , and its surgical use.

The book, al-Abniya [ edit ] Between 968 and 977 C.E., Muwaffaq compiled his Book of the Remedies ( Kitab al-Abniya 'an Haqa'iq al-Adwiya , کتاب الابنیه عن حقائق الادویه ), [ 2 ] which is the oldest prose work in New Persian .

[ citation needed ] It is also the only work of his to survive into modern times. The book begins with an introductory general theory of pharmacology .

[ 3 ] The body of the work mainly deals with over five-hundred remedies (most of which are plant-based, however seventy-five come from minerals, and forty-four from animals); they are classified into four groups according to their physiological action.

[ citation needed ] Muwaffaq was a consummate scholar, and cited Arab, Greek, Syrian and Ayurvedic authorities.

[ 3 ] The oldest copy of this book that we have is from 1055, which was transcribed by Asadi Tusi , a famous poet, and is in the Austrian National Library .
