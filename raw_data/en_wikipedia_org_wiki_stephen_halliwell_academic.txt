From 1995 he was Professor of Greek at the University of St Andrews and Wardlaw Professor of Classics from 2014; having retired in October 2020, he is now emeritus professor .

[ 1 ] He was President of the Classical Association for 2024-25.

[ 2 ] Early life and education [ edit ] Halliwell was born in Wigan , Lancashire, England.

[ 3 ] He was educated at St Francis Xavier's College , an all-boys Catholic school in Liverpool.

[ 3 ] He studied Literae humaniores (i.e.

Classics ) at Worcester College, Oxford , graduating with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree, first class, in 1976.

[ 4 ] He remained at Oxford to undertake a Doctor of Philosophy (DPhil) degree, which he was awarded in 1981.

[ 4 ] His doctoral thesis , supervised by Sir Kenneth Dover, was titled "Personal jokes in Aristophanes".

[ 5 ] Academic career [ edit ] Halliwell taught at the universities of Oxford, London, Cambridge (where he was a Fellow of Corpus Christi College ), and Birmingham.

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] He has also held visiting positions at the University of Chicago , the Center for Ideas and Society ( University of California, Riverside ), Roma Tre University , McMaster University (H. L. Hooker Distinguished Visiting Professor), the Université catholique de Louvain (Chaire Cardinal Mercier), and Cornell University (Townsend Visiting Professor, Department of Classics). He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (FRSE) in 2011, [ 8 ] and a Fellow of the British Academy (FBA) in 2014.

[ 9 ] Although his publications cover many topics in ancient Greek literature and philosophy, from Homer to Neoplatonism , Halliwell has worked most extensively on Ancient Greek comedy , especially Aristophanes , and Greek philosophical poetics and aesthetics , especially in the writings of Plato and Aristotle . Halliwell's characteristic style of tackling large issues of cultural significance through the fine-grained interpretation of texts led David Konstan, in reviewing Between Ecstasy and Truth , to call him ‘the ideal close reader’, whose arguments are ‘detailed, learned, and nuanced’.

[ 10 ] Two of his books have won international prizes: The Aesthetics of Mimesis , described in The Times Literary Supplement as 'formidable' and 'an outstanding example of taking ideas seriously', [ 11 ] won the Premio Europeo di Estetica 2008; [ 12 ] and Greek Laughter , which one reviewer called 'monumental' and 'an extraordinary resource', [ 13 ] won the Criticos Prize (since renamed the London Hellenic Prize) 2008.

[ 14 ] Halliwell has given two hundred invited research papers in eighteen countries.

[ 15 ] He has also made a number of appearances in broadcast media, including the BBC radio programme In Our Time .

[ 16 ] His work has been translated into nine languages.

[ 17 ] Personal life [ edit ] In 1978, Halliwell married Helen Ruth Gainford. Together they had two sons. They divorced in 2010.
