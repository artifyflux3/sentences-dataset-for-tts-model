_[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four\_Horsemen\_of\_the\_Apocalypse "Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse")_, woodcut print from the _[Apocalypse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalypse\_(D%C3%BCrer) "Apocalypse (Dürer)")_ of [Albrecht Dürer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albrecht_D%C3%BCrer "Albrecht Dürer") (1497–1498)

**Eschatology** (; from [Ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_language "Ancient Greek language")[ἔσχατος](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E1%BC%94%CF%83%CF%87%CE%B1%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%82#Ancient_Greek "wikt:ἔσχατος")_(\_éskhatos\_)_'last' and _[-logy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/-logy "-logy")_) concerns expectations of the end of [present age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contemporary_era "Contemporary era"), [human history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_history "Human history"), or the world itself.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-FOOTNOTECarroll2000420-1) The **end of the world** or **end times**[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-2) is predicted by several [world religions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_religion "World religion") (both [Abrahamic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abrahamic_religions "Abrahamic religions") and non-Abrahamic), which teach that negative world events will reach a climax. Belief that the end of the world is imminent is known as [apocalypticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalypticism "Apocalypticism"), and over time has been held both by members of mainstream religions and by [doomsday cults](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_cult "Doomsday cult"). In the context of [mysticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysticism "Mysticism"), the term refers metaphorically to the end of ordinary reality and to reunion with the [divine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divinity "Divinity"). Many religions treat eschatology as a future event prophesied in sacred texts or in [folklore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folklore "Folklore"), while other religions may have concepts of renewal or transformation after significant events. The explicit description of a new earth is primarily found in Christian teachings (this description can be found in Chapter 21 of the [Book of Revelation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Revelation "Book of Revelation")).

The Abrahamic religions maintain a linear [cosmology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology "Cosmology"), with end-time scenarios containing themes of [transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiritual_transformation "Spiritual transformation") and [redemption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redemption_(theology) "Redemption (theology)"). In [Judaism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaism "Judaism"), the term "end of days" makes reference to the [Messianic Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messianic_Age "Messianic Age") and includes an in-gathering of the exiled [Jewish diaspora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_diaspora "Jewish diaspora"), the coming of the [Messiah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messiah_in_Judaism "Messiah in Judaism"), the [resurrection of the righteous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Techiyat_hamaysim "Techiyat hamaysim"), and the [world to come](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_eschatology#World_to_come "Jewish eschatology"). [Christianity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity "Christianity") depicts the end time as a period of [tribulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribulation "Tribulation") that precedes the [second coming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Coming "Second Coming") of [Christ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_Christ "Jesus Christ"), who will face the rise of the [Antichrist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antichrist "Antichrist") along with his power structure and [false prophets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_prophet "False prophet"), and usher in the [Kingdom of God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_God "Kingdom of God"). In later traditions of Islam, separate hadiths detail the [Day of Judgment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yawm_al-Qiy%C4%81mah "Yawm al-Qiyāmah") as preceded by the appearance of the [Masīḥ ad-Dajjāl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Masih_ad-Dajjal "Al-Masih ad-Dajjal"), and followed by the descending of [ʿĪsā](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_in_Islam "Jesus in Islam") ([Jesus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus "Jesus")), which shall triumph over the false Messiah or Antichrist; his defeat will lead to a sequence of events that will end with the sun rising from the west and the beginning of the [Qiyāmah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qiyamah "Qiyamah") (Judgment Day).

[Dharmic religions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharmic_religions "Dharmic religions") tend to have more cyclical worldviews, with end-time eschatologies characterized by [decay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_disintegration "Social disintegration"), redemption, and rebirth (though some believe transitions between cycles are relatively uneventful). In [Hinduism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinduism "Hinduism"), the end time occurs when [Kalki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalki "Kalki"), the final incarnation of [Vishnu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vishnu "Vishnu"), descends atop a [white horse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_horse_(mythology) "White horse (mythology)") and brings an end to the current _[Kali Yuga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kali\_Yuga "Kali Yuga")_, completing a cycle that starts again with the regeneration of the world. In [Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism "Buddhism"), the [Buddha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddha "Buddha") predicted his teachings would be forgotten after 5,000 years, followed by turmoil. It says a _[bodhisattva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodhisattva "Bodhisattva")_ named [Maitreya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maitreya "Maitreya") will appear and rediscover the teachings of the _Buddha Dharma_, and that the ultimate destruction of the world will then come through seven suns.

Since the development of the concept of [deep time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_time "Deep time") in the 18th century[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-3) and the calculation of the [estimated age of planet Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Earth "Age of Earth"), scientific discourse about end times has considered the [ultimate fate of the universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_fate_of_the_universe "Ultimate fate of the universe"). Theories have included the [Big Rip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Rip "Big Rip"), [Big Crunch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Crunch "Big Crunch"), [Big Bounce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bounce "Big Bounce"), and [Big Freeze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Freeze "Big Freeze") ([heat death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_death_of_the_universe "Heat death of the universe")). Social and scientific commentators also worry about [global catastrophic risks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_catastrophic_risks "Global catastrophic risks") and [scenarios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_catastrophe_scenarios "Global catastrophe scenarios") that could result in [human extinction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_extinction "Human extinction").

The word "eschatology" arises from the [Ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek "Ancient Greek") term [ἔσχατος](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E1%BC%94%CF%83%CF%87%CE%B1%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%82 "wikt:ἔσχατος") (_éschatos_), meaning "last", and _[-logy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/-logy "-logy")_, meaning "the study of", and first appeared in English around 1844.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-4) The _[Oxford English Dictionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford\_English\_Dictionary "Oxford English Dictionary")_ defines eschatology as "the part of theology concerned with death, judgment, and the final destiny of the soul and of humankind".[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-5)

The main tenets of modern Jewish eschatology, in no particular order, include:[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-Jewish_Eschatology-6)

*   God will redeem Israel from the captivity that began during the [Babylonian Exile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_Exile "Babylonian Exile") in a new [Exodus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Exodus "The Exodus").
*   God will return the Jewish people to the [Land of Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_of_Israel "Land of Israel").
*   God will restore the [House of David](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davidic_line "Davidic line") and the [Temple in Jerusalem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Third_Temple "The Third Temple").
*   God will raise up a regent from the House of David, the [Jewish Messiah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Messiah "Jewish Messiah"), to lead the Jewish people and the world and to usher in an age of justice and peace, the [Messianic Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messianic_Age "Messianic Age").
*   Non-Jews will recognize that the [God of Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_in_Judaism "God in Judaism") is the only true god.
*   God will [resurrect the dead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resurrection_of_the_Dead "Resurrection of the Dead").
*   God will create a [new heaven and earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_to_Come#Judaism "World to Come").[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-7)

Judaism usually refers to the end times as the "end of days" (_aḥarit ha-yamim_, אחרית הימים), a phrase that appears several times in the [Tanakh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanakh "Tanakh"). The end times are addressed in the [Book of Daniel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Daniel "Book of Daniel") and in numerous other prophetic passages in the Hebrew scriptures, and also in the [Talmud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talmud "Talmud"), particularly Tractate [Avodah Zarah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avodah_Zarah "Avodah Zarah").

The idea of a Messianic Age, an era of global peace and knowledge of the Creator, has a prominent place in Jewish thought, and is incorporated as part of the end of days. A well-known passage from the [Book of Isaiah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Isaiah "Book of Isaiah") describes this future condition of the world: "They shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks; nation will not lift sword against nation and they will no longer study warfare" (Isaiah 2:4, see also [Micah 4:3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Micah "Book of Micah")).[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-Jewish_Eschatology-6)[Maimonides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides "Maimonides") (1135–1204) further describes the Messianic Era in the [Mishneh Torah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mishneh_Torah "Mishneh Torah"): "And at that time there will be no hunger or war, no jealousy or rivalry. For the good will be plentiful, and all delicacies available as dust. The entire occupation of the world will be only to know God;... the people Israel will be of great wisdom; they will perceive the esoteric truths and comprehend their Creator's wisdom as is the capacity of man. As it is written (Isaiah 11:9): 'For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of God, as the waters cover the sea.'"[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-8)

In [Kabbalah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabbalah "Kabbalah"), the [Zohar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zohar "Zohar") maintains that the seven days of the week, based on the seven days of creation, correspond to the seven millennia of creation.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-9) The seventh day of the week, the [Shabbat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shabbat "Shabbat") day of rest, corresponds to the seventh millennium, the age of universal rest, or the Messianic Era. The seventh millennium begins with the [year 6000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_6000 "Year 6000")[AM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anno_Mundi "Anno Mundi"), and is the latest time the Messiah can come. A number of early and late Jewish scholars have written in support of this, including the [Ramban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nahmanides "Nahmanides"),[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-10)[Isaac Abarbanel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Abarbanel "Isaac Abarbanel"),[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-11)[Abraham Ibn Ezra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Ibn_Ezra "Abraham Ibn Ezra"),[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-12) Rabbeinu [Bachya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachya "Bachya"),[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-13) the [Vilna Gaon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilna_Gaon "Vilna Gaon"),[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-14) the [Lubavitcher Rebbe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lubavitcher_Rebbe "Lubavitcher Rebbe"),[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-15) the [Ramchal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramchal "Ramchal"),[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-16)[Aryeh Kaplan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryeh_Kaplan "Aryeh Kaplan")[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-17) and Rebbetzin [Esther Jungreis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esther_Jungreis "Esther Jungreis").[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-18)

Frashokereti is the [Zoroastrian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoroastrian "Zoroastrian") doctrine of a final renovation of the universe when evil will be destroyed, and everything else will then be in perfect unity with God ([Ahura Mazda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahura_Mazda "Ahura Mazda")). The doctrinal premises are:

1.   Good will eventually prevail over evil.
2.   Creation, initially perfectly good, was subsequently corrupted by evil.
3.   The world will ultimately be restored to the perfection it had at the time of creation.
4.   The "salvation for the individual depended on the sum of [that person's] thoughts, words and deeds, and there could be no intervention, whether compassionate or capricious, by any divine being to alter this". Thus each human bears the [responsibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility_(disambiguation) "Responsibility (disambiguation)") for the fate of his own soul, and simultaneously shares in the responsibility for the fate of the world.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-Boyce-19)

Zoroastrian eschatology is considered one of the oldest in recorded history. The birth of its founder, [Zoroaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoroaster "Zoroaster"), is unknown, with scholarly dates ranging from 500 BCE to 1,500 BCE. [Pliny the Elder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pliny_the_Elder "Pliny the Elder") even suggests there were two Zoroasters.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-WestDate13-20) However, with beliefs paralleling and possibly predating the framework of the major Abrahamic faiths, a fully developed concept of the end of the world was not established in Zoroastrianism until 500 BCE. The [Bahman Yasht](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahman_Yasht "Bahman Yasht") describes:

> At the end of thy tenth hundredth winter, the sun is more unseen and more spotted; the year, month, and day are shorter; and the earth is more barren; and the crop will not yield the seed. And men become more deceitful and more given to vile practices. They will have no gratitude. Honorable wealth will proceed to those of perverted faith. And a dark cloud makes the whole sky night, and it will rain more noxious creatures than water.

A battle between the righteous and wicked will be followed by the [Frashokereti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frashokereti "Frashokereti"). On earth, the [Saoshyant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saoshyant "Saoshyant") will arrive as the final savior of mankind, and bring about the [resurrection of the dead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resurrection_of_the_dead "Resurrection of the dead"). The _yazata_ s [Airyaman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airyaman "Airyaman") and [Atar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atar "Atar") will melt the metal in the hills and mountains, which will flow as lava across the earth and all mankind, both the living and resurrected, will be required to wade through it. _[Ashavan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashavan "Ashavan")_ will pass through the molten river as if it were warm milk, but the sinful will burn. It will then flow down to hell, where it will annihilate [Angra Mainyu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angra_Mainyu "Angra Mainyu") and the last vestiges of wickedness.

The righteous will partake of the _parahaoma_, which will confer immortality upon them. Humanity will become like the [Amesha Spentas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amesha_Spenta "Amesha Spenta"), living without food, hunger, thirst, weapons or injury. Bodies will become so light as to cast no shadow. All humanity will speak a single language, and belong to a single nation with no borders. All will share a single purpose and goal, joining with [Ahura Mazda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahura_Mazda "Ahura Mazda") for a perpetual and divine exaltation.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-21)[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-Boyce-19)

The [Gnostic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnosticism "Gnosticism") codex [On the Origin of the World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Origin_of_the_World "On the Origin of the World") (possibly dating from near the end of the third century AD) states that during what is called the consummation of the age, the Sun and Moon will become dark as the stars change their ordinary course. Kings will make war with each other, and thunder will cause the world to be shaken. The corrupt [Archons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archon_(Gnosticism) "Archon (Gnosticism)") will mourn. The sea will be troubled by fighting of the kings who became drunk from the [flaming sword](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flaming_sword_(mythology) "Flaming sword (mythology)"). Finally, great thunder will come from [Sophia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophia_(Gnosticism) "Sophia (Gnosticism)"), the woman in the [firmament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmament "Firmament") above the forces of [Chaos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_(cosmogony) "Chaos (cosmogony)"). She will cast the corrupt gods into the [abyss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abyss_(religion) "Abyss (religion)") where they will fight each other until only their chief [Yaldabaoth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demiurge#Yaldabaoth "Demiurge") remains and destroys himself. Next the heavens of the Archons will collapse on each other before the Earth sinks into the abyss. Light will cover the darkness and eliminate it then form into something greater than anything that ever existed before. The source of the darkness will dissolve, and the deficiency will be taken from its root. Those who were not perfected in the [unconceived one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(Gnosticism) "Monad (Gnosticism)") will receive glories in their realms and kingdoms of the immortals, but those who were will enter a kingless realm. All will be judged according to their deeds and [gnosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnosis "Gnosis").[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-22)

Christian eschatology is the study concerned with the ultimate destiny of the individual [soul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul "Soul") and of the entire created order, based primarily upon [biblical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical "Biblical") texts within the [Old](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Testament "Old Testament") and [New Testaments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Testament "New Testament").

Christian eschatological research looks to study and discuss matters such as the nature of the [divine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divinity "Divinity") and the divine nature of [Jesus Christ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_Christ "Jesus Christ"), death and the [afterlife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afterlife "Afterlife"), [Heaven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven_in_Christianity "Heaven in Christianity") and [Hell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_views_on_Hell "Christian views on Hell"), the [Second Coming of Jesus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Coming "Second Coming"), the [resurrection of the dead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resurrection_of_the_dead "Resurrection of the dead"), the [rapture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapture "Rapture"), the [Tribulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribulation "Tribulation"), [millennialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennialism "Millennialism"), the end of the world, the [Last Judgment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Judgment "Last Judgment"), and the New Heaven and [New Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Earth_(Christianity) "New Earth (Christianity)") in the [world to come](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_to_come "World to come").

Eschatological passages occur in many places in the Bible, in both the [Old](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Testament "Old Testament") and the [New Testaments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Testament "New Testament"). In the Old Testament, apocalyptic eschatology can be found notably in [Isaiah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah "Isaiah") 24–27, Isaiah 56–66, [Joel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Joel "Book of Joel"), [Zechariah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Zechariah "Book of Zechariah") 9–14 as well as in the closing chapters of [Daniel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Daniel "Book of Daniel"), and in [Ezekiel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Ezekiel "Book of Ezekiel").[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-NBD-23) In the New Testament, applicable passages include [Matthew 24](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_24 "Matthew 24"), [Mark 13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_13 "Mark 13"), the [parable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable "Parable") of "[The Sheep and the Goats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sheep_and_the_Goats "The Sheep and the Goats")" and the [Book of Revelation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Revelation "Book of Revelation")—Revelation often occupies a central place in Christian eschatology.

The Second Coming of Christ is the central event in Christian eschatology within the broader context of the fullness of the [Kingdom of God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_God_(Christianity) "Kingdom of God (Christianity)"). Most Christians believe that death and [suffering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering "Suffering") will continue to exist until Christ's return. There are, however, various views concerning the order and significance of other eschatological events.

The Book of Revelation stands at the core of much of Christian eschatology. The study of Revelation is usually divided into four interpretative methodologies or [hermeneutics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutic "Hermeneutic"):

*   The [Futurist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futurism_(Christian_eschatology) "Futurism (Christian eschatology)") approach treats the Book of Revelation mostly as unfulfilled prophecy taking place in some yet undetermined future.
*   The [Preterist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterism "Preterism") approach interprets Revelation chiefly as having had prophetic fulfillment in the past, principally in the events of the first century CE.
*   The [Historicist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historicism_(Christian_eschatology) "Historicism (Christian eschatology)") approach places Revelation within the context of history, identifying figures and passages in Revelation with major historical people and events. This view was commonly held by the [early Christian church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Church "Early Church"), then among the predecessors to [Protestantism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestantism "Protestantism"), such as [John Wycliffe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wycliffe "John Wycliffe"),[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-24)[_[need quotation to verify](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability "Wikipedia:Verifiability")_][Joachim of Fiore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joachim_of_Fiore "Joachim of Fiore")[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-25) and later by the majority of [Protestant Reformers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_Reformers "Protestant Reformers"), such as [Martin Luther](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther "Martin Luther"),[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-26)[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-27)[John Calvin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Calvin "John Calvin"),[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-28) and [John Wesley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wesley "John Wesley").[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-29) Further supporters of this view included [Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton")[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-30) (1642–1727), among others.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-31)[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-32)
*   The [Idealist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idealism_(Christian_eschatology) "Idealism (Christian eschatology)") approach sees the events of Revelation as neither past nor future actualities, but as purely symbolic accounts, dealing with the ongoing struggle and ultimate triumph of [good over evil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_and_evil "Good and evil").

[First-century Christians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity_in_the_1st_century "Christianity in the 1st century") believed Jesus would return during their lifetime. When the converts of Paul in [Thessalonica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thessalonica "Thessalonica") were persecuted by the [Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire "Roman Empire"), they believed the end of days to be imminent.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-33) Most of the scholars participating in the [third quest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quest_for_the_historical_Jesus#Third_quest "Quest for the historical Jesus") hold that Jesus was an eschatological prophet who believed the "[Kingdom of God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_God "Kingdom of God")" was coming within his own lifetime or within the lifetime of his contemporaries.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-TM1998_1-34)[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-35)[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-36) This view, generally known as "consistent eschatology," was influential during the early to the mid—twentieth century and continues to be influential today in proposed portraits of the [Historical Jesus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_Jesus "Historical Jesus"). Dale Allison argues that while Jesus expected an imminent end, its date was not unchangeable and was contingent on the repentance of Israel to proceed.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-37) However, [C. H. Dodd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._H._Dodd "C. H. Dodd") and others have insisted on a "realized eschatology" that says Jesus' own ministry fulfilled prophetic hopes. Many conservative scholars have adopted the paradoxical position the [Kingdom of God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_God "Kingdom of God") passages describes a kingdom that is both "present" and "still to come" claiming Pauline eschatology as support.[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-Geddert-38): 208–209 [R. T. France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._T._France "R. T. France") and [N. T. Wright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N._T._Wright "N. T. Wright") among others have taken Jesus' apocalyptic statements of an imminent end, historically, as referring to the fall of Jerusalem and the destruction of the Temple in 70 AD.[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-39)[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-40)[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-41)[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-Albert_Hogeterp-42): 143–152  A number of interpretations of the term "Kingdom of God" have thus appeared in its eschatological context, e.g., [apocalyptic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalypticism "Apocalypticism"), [realized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realized_eschatology "Realized eschatology") or [Inaugurated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inaugurated_eschatology "Inaugurated eschatology") eschatologies, yet no consensus has emerged among scholars.[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-43)[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-44)

While some who believe in the literal interpretation of the Bible insist the prediction of dates or times is futile, others believe Jesus foretold signs of the end of days. The precise time, however, will come like a "thief in the night" ([1 Thess. 5:2](https://bible.oremus.org/?passage=1%20Thessalonians%205:2&version=nrsv)). They may also refer to [Matthew 24:36](https://bible.oremus.org/?passage=Matthew%2024:36&version=nrsv) in which Jesus is quoted as saying:

> "But concerning that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father only."

In the New Testament, Jesus refers to this period preceding the end times as the "Great Tribulation" ([Matthew 24:21](https://bible.oremus.org/?passage=Matthew%2024:21&version=nrsv)), "Affliction" ([Mark 13:19](https://bible.oremus.org/?passage=Mark%2013:19&version=nrsv)), and "days of vengeance" ([Luke 21:22](https://bible.oremus.org/?passage=Luke%2021:22&version=nrsv)).

The Book of Matthew describes the devastation:

> When ye therefore shall see the [abomination of desolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abomination_of_desolation "Abomination of desolation"), spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoso readeth, let him understand). Then let them which be in Judaea flee into the mountains. Let him which is on the housetop not come down....Neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes, and woe unto them that are with child....For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be. And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened.

The resulting chaos will affect pregnancies, newborns, and a scourge will spread throughout the flesh, save for the elect. The vivid imagery of this section is repeated closely in [Mark 13:14–20](https://bible.oremus.org/?passage=Mark%2013:14%E2%80%9320&version=nrsv).

The Gospel of Luke describes a complete unraveling of the social fabric, with widespread calamity and war:

> Then he said to them, "Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be great earthquakes, and in various places famines and pestilences. And there will be terrors and great signs from heaven. But before all this they will lay their hands on you and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues and prisons, and you will be brought before kings and governors for my name's sake. This will be your opportunity to bear witness. Settle it therefore in your minds not to meditate beforehand how to answer, for I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which none of your adversaries will be able to withstand or contradict. You will be delivered up even by parents and brothers and relatives and friends, and some of you they will put to death. You will be hated by all for my name's sake. But not a hair of your head will perish. By your endurance you will gain your lives.
> 
> 
> "But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that its desolation has come near. Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains, and let those who are inside the city depart, and let not those who are out in the country enter it, for these are days of vengeance, to fulfill all that is written. Alas for women who are pregnant and for those who are nursing infants in those days! For there will be great distress upon the earth and wrath against this people. They will fall by the edge of the sword and be led captive among all nations, and Jerusalem will be trampled underfoot by the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.
> 
> 
> "And there will be signs in sun and moon and stars, and on the earth distress of nations in perplexity because of the roaring of the sea and the waves, people fainting with fear and with foreboding of what is coming on the world. For the powers of the heavens will be shaken. And then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. Now when these things begin to take place, straighten up and raise your heads, because your redemption is drawing near."
> 
> 
> And he told them a parable: "Look at the fig tree, and all the trees. As soon as they come out in leaf, you see for yourselves and know that the summer is already near. So also, when you see these things taking place, you know that the kingdom of God is near. Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all has taken place. Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away."

In the Book of Revelation, the "great tribulation" (Rev. 7:14b) refers to a time of affliction upon God's people.

The [Profession of Faith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profession_of_faith_(Catholic_Church) "Profession of faith (Catholic Church)") addresses Catholic beliefs concerning the last days.[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-45) Catholicism adheres to the [amillennial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amillennialism "Amillennialism") school of thought, promoted by [Augustine of Hippo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo "Augustine of Hippo") in his work [_The City of God_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_God_(book) "City of God (book)").

Contemporary use of the term _End Times_ has evolved from literal belief in Christian millennialism. In this tradition, [Biblical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical "Biblical")[apocalypse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalypse "Apocalypse") is believed to be imminent, with various current events as [omens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omen "Omen") of impending [Armageddon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armageddon "Armageddon"). These beliefs have been put forward by the Adventist movement ([Millerites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millerites "Millerites")) and [dispensational premillennialists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispensationalism "Dispensationalism"). In 1918 a group of eight, well-known preachers produced the [London Manifesto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Manifesto "London Manifesto"), warning of an imminent second coming of Christ shortly after the 1917 liberation of Jerusalem by the British.

##### Millennialists and Amillennialists

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eschatology&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Millennialists and Amillennialists")]

[![Image 4](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/Antichrist1.jpg/250px-Antichrist1.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Antichrist1.jpg)

The Antichrist, by [Lucas Cranach the Elder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_Cranach_the_Elder "Lucas Cranach the Elder") (1521). Here the [Antichrist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antichrist "Antichrist") is shown wearing the triple crown of the Roman papacy.

Protestants are divided between Millennialists and Amillennialists. Millennialists concentrate on the issue of whether the true believers will see the [Great Tribulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Tribulation "Great Tribulation") or be removed from it by what is referred to as a Pre-Tribulation [rapture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapture "Rapture").

Amillennialists believe the end times encompass the time from Christ's ascension to the last day, and maintain that the mention of the "thousand years" in the [Book of Revelation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Revelation "Book of Revelation") is meant to be taken [metaphorically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphor "Metaphor") (i.e., not literally), a view which continues to cause divisions within [Protestant Christianity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestantism "Protestantism").

There is a range of eschatological belief in Protestant Christianity. Christian [premillennialists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premillennialism "Premillennialism") who believe the end times are occurring now, are usually specific about timelines that climax in the end of the world. For some, Israel, the [European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union "European Union"), or the United Nations are seen as major players whose roles were foretold in scripture. Within [dispensational premillennialist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispensationalism "Dispensationalism") writing, there is the belief that Christians will be summoned to [Heaven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven "Heaven") by Christ at the [rapture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapture "Rapture"), occurring before a Great Tribulation prophesied in Matthew 24–25; Mark 13 and Luke 21. The Tribulation is described in the Book of Revelation.

"End times" may also refer to the passing of an age or long period in the relationship between man and God.[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-46) Adherents to this view cite the [Second Epistle to Timothy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Epistle_to_Timothy "Second Epistle to Timothy") and draw analogies to the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries.

Post-Exilic Hebrew books of [prophecy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophecy "Prophecy") such as [Daniel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Daniel "Book of Daniel") and [Ezekiel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Ezekiel "Book of Ezekiel") are given new interpretations in this Christian tradition, while [apocalyptic forecasts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalyptic_literature "Apocalyptic literature") appear in the Judeo-Christian [Sibylline Oracles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sibylline_Oracles "Sibylline Oracles") which include the Book of Revelation ascribed to John, the [apocryphal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocrypha "Apocrypha")[Apocalypse of Peter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalypse_of_Peter "Apocalypse of Peter"), and the [Second Book of Esdras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2_Esdras "2 Esdras").

##### Adventists and Millerites

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eschatology&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Adventists and Millerites")]

[![Image 5](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Icon_second_coming.jpg/250px-Icon_second_coming.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Icon_second_coming.jpg)

Religious movements which expect that the [second coming of Christ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parousia "Parousia") will be a cataclysmic event are generally called [adventism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventism "Adventism"). These have arisen throughout the Christian era, but were particularly common after the [Protestant Reformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_Reformation "Protestant Reformation"). [Emanuel Swedenborg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emanuel_Swedenborg "Emanuel Swedenborg") considered the second coming to be symbolic, and to have occurred in 1757. Along with others, he developed a religious system around the second coming of Christ, disclosed by new prophecy or special revelation not described in the Bible. The [Millerites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millerites "Millerites") are diverse religious groups which similarly rely upon a special gift of interpretation for predicting the second coming.

The difference between the 19th-century Millerite and adventist movements and contemporary prophecy is that [William Miller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Miller_(preacher) "William Miller (preacher)") and his followers, based on biblical interpretation, predicted the time of the Second Coming to have occurred in 1844. Contemporary writing of end time has suggested the timetable will be triggered by future wars and [moral catastrophe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_panic "Moral panic"), and that this time of tribulation is close at hand.

Seventh-day Adventists believe biblical prophecy to foretell an end time scenario in which the United States works in conjunction with the Catholic Church to mandate worship on a day other than the true Sabbath, Saturday, as prescribed in the Ten Commandments (Exodus 20:8–11). This will bring about a situation where one must choose for or against the Bible as the will of God.[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-47)

Another view of the _end times_ is [preterism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterism "Preterism"). It distinguishes _the time of the end_ from _the end of time_. Preterists believe the term _last days_ (or _Time of the End_) refers to, neither the last days of the Earth, nor the last days of humankind, but the end of the [Old Covenant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_covenant "Mosaic covenant") between [God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahweh "Yahweh") and [Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israelites#Biblical_narrative "Israelites"); which, according to preterism, took place when the [Temple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Temple "Second Temple") in [Jerusalem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem "Jerusalem") was destroyed in 70 [CE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Era "Common Era").

Preterists believe that [prophecies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible_Prophecy "Bible Prophecy")—such as the [Second Coming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Coming "Second Coming"), the desecration of the Jewish Temple, the destruction of Jerusalem, the rise of the [Antichrist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antichrist "Antichrist"), the [Great Tribulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Tribulation "Great Tribulation"), the advent of [The Day of the Lord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Day_of_the_Lord "The Day of the Lord"), and a [Final Judgment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Judgment "Last Judgment")—had been fulfilled when the Romans [sacked Jerusalem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destruction_of_Jerusalem "Destruction of Jerusalem") and completely destroyed its Temple.

Proponents of _full preterism_ do not believe in a coming [resurrection of the dead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resurrection_of_the_dead "Resurrection of the dead"). They place this event (as well as the Second Coming) in the year 70. Advocates of [partial preterism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_preterism "Partial preterism") do believe in a coming resurrection. Full preterists contend that partial preterists are merely _futurists_, since they believe the Second Coming, the Resurrection, the [Rapture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapture "Rapture"), and the Judgment are yet to come.

Many preterists believe first-century [Christians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christians "Christians") experienced the Rapture to rejoin the [Christ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ "Christ").

According with Preterism's [interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_views_on_the_Old_Covenant "Christian views on the Old Covenant") of end times, many "time passages" in the [New Testament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Testament "New Testament") foretell a [Second Coming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Coming "Second Coming") of Christ, with last days to take place within the lifetimes of his disciples: [Matt.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_of_Matthew "Gospel of Matthew") 10:23, Matt. 16:28, Matt. 24:34, Matt. 26:64, [Rom.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistle_to_the_Romans "Epistle to the Romans") 13:11–12, [1 Cor.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_Corinthians "1 Corinthians") 7:29–31, 1 Cor. 10:11, [Phil.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistle_to_the_Philippians "Epistle to the Philippians") 4:5, [James](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistle_of_James "Epistle of James") 5:8–9, [1 Pet.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_Peter "1 Peter") 4:7, [1 Jn.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_John "1 John") 2:18.

Dispensationalism is an [evangelical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelical "Evangelical")[futurist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futurist "Futurist") Biblical interpretation that foresees a series of [dispensations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispensation_(period) "Dispensation (period)"), or periods, in which God relates to human beings under different [Biblical covenants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_covenants "Biblical covenants"). The belief system is primarily rooted in the writings of [John Nelson Darby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Nelson_Darby "John Nelson Darby") and is [premillennial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premillennial "Premillennial") in content. The [reestablishment of Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_Independence_(Israel) "Declaration of Independence (Israel)") in 1948 provided a major impetus to the dispensationalist belief system. The wars of Israel after 1948 with its Arab neighbors provided further support, according to [John F. Walvoord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Walvoord "John F. Walvoord").[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-48) After the [Six-Day War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six-Day_War "Six-Day War") in 1967, and the [Yom Kippur War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yom_Kippur_War "Yom Kippur War") in 1973, it seemed plausible to many [Fundamentalist Christians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamentalist_Christians "Fundamentalist Christians") in the 1970s that Middle East turmoil may well be leading up to the fulfillment of various Bible prophecies and to the Battle of Armageddon.

Members of the dispensationalist movement such as [Hal Lindsey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hal_Lindsey "Hal Lindsey"), [J. Dwight Pentecost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Dwight_Pentecost "J. Dwight Pentecost"), [John Walvoord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Walvoord "John Walvoord"), all of whom have [Dallas Theological Seminary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Theological_Seminary "Dallas Theological Seminary") backgrounds, and some other writers, claimed further that the [European Economic Community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Community "European Economic Community"), which preceded the [European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union "European Union"), would become a [United States of Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Federation "European Federation"), which would in turn become a Revived Roman Empire ruled by the [Antichrist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antichrist "Antichrist"). The Revived Roman Empire also figured into the [New Testament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Testament "New Testament") writers' vision of the future. The fact that in the early 1970s, there were (erroneously thought to be) seven nations in the European Economic Community was held to be significant; this aligned the Community with a seven-headed beast mentioned in Revelation. This specific prophecy has required revision, but the idea of a Revived Roman Empire remains.

Dispensationalism, in contrast to the Millerite Adventist movement, had its beginning in the 19th century, when [John Nelson Darby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Nelson_Darby "John Nelson Darby"), founder of the [Plymouth Brethren](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plymouth_Brethren "Plymouth Brethren")[religious denomination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_denomination "Religious denomination"), incorporated into his system of Biblical interpretation a system of organizing Biblical time into a number of discrete [dispensations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispensation_(period) "Dispensation (period)"), each of which marks a separate [covenant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covenant_(religion) "Covenant (religion)") with God. Darby's beliefs were widely publicized in [Cyrus I. Scofield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrus_I._Scofield "Cyrus I. Scofield")'s _[Scofield Reference Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scofield\_Reference\_Bible "Scofield Reference Bible")_, an annotated Bible that became popular in the United States.

Since the majority of the Biblical prophets were writing at a time when the [Temple in Jerusalem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_in_Jerusalem "Temple in Jerusalem") was still functioning, they wrote as if it would still be standing during the prophesied events. According to preterism, this was a fulfillment of the prophecies. However, according to [Futurists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futurism_(Christian_eschatology) "Futurism (Christian eschatology)"), their destruction in AD 70 put the prophetic timetable on hold. Many such believers therefore anticipated the return of Jews to Israel and the [reconstruction of the Temple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Temple#Christian_views "Third Temple") before the Second Coming could occur.[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-49)[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-50)

#### Posttribulation premillennialism

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eschatology&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Posttribulation premillennialism")]

A view of the Second Coming of Christ as held by [posttribulational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-tribulation_rapture "Post-tribulation rapture") premillennialists holds that the Church of Christ will have to undergo great persecution by being present during the great tribulation.

#### Specific prophetic movements

[![Image 6](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/William_Miller.jpg/250px-William_Miller.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:William_Miller.jpg)

William Miller predicted the end of the world in 1843, known as the [Great Disappointment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Disappointment "Great Disappointment").

In 1843, [William Miller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Miller_(preacher) "William Miller (preacher)") made the first of several predictions that the world would end in only a few months. As his predictions did not come true (referred to as the [Great Disappointment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Disappointment "Great Disappointment")), [followers of Miller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millerites "Millerites") went on to found separate groups, the most successful of which is the [Seventh-day Adventist Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh-day_Adventist_Church "Seventh-day Adventist Church").

Members of the [Baháʼí Faith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bah%C3%A1%CA%BC%C3%AD_Faith "Baháʼí Faith") believe Miller's interpretation of signs and dates of the coming of Jesus were, for the most part, correct.[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-momen-51) They believe the fulfillment of biblical prophecies of the coming of Christ came through a forerunner of their own religion, the [Báb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A1b "Báb"). According to the Báb's words, 4 April 1844 was "the first day that the Spirit descended" into his heart.[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-Momen_2007_71%E2%80%9388-52) His subsequent declaration to [Mullá Husayn-i Bushru'i](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mull%C3%A1_Husayn "Mullá Husayn") that he was the "Promised One"—an event now commemorated by Baháʼís as a [major holy day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascension_of_Bah%C3%A1%27u%27ll%C3%A1h "Ascension of Bahá'u'lláh")—took place on 23 May 1844. It was in October of that year that the Báb embarked on a [pilgrimage to Mecca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajj "Hajj"), where he openly declared his claims to the [Sharif of Mecca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharif_of_Mecca "Sharif of Mecca").[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-Chron-53)[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-gpb-54) The first news coverage of these events in the West was in 1845 by _[The Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Times "The Times")_,[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-Momen_1999_online-55) followed by others in 1850 in the United States.[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-Bah%C3%A1'%C3%AD_Library_Online-56) The first Baháʼí to come to America was in 1892.[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-Chron-53) Several Baháʼí books and pamphlets make mention of the Millerites, the prophecies used by Miller and the Great Disappointment, most notably [William Sears](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Sears_(Bah%C3%A1%CA%BC%C3%AD) "William Sears (Baháʼí)")'s _Thief in the Night_.[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-sears-57)[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-Bowers_2004_12-58)[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-Motlagh_1992_205%E2%80%93213-59)

The eschatology of [Jehovah's Witnesses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jehovah%27s_Witnesses "Jehovah's Witnesses") is central to their religious beliefs. They believe [Jesus Christ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_Christ "Jesus Christ") has been ruling in heaven as king since 1914 (a date they believe was prophesied in the Bible) and that after that time a period of cleansing occurred, resulting in God's selection of the [Bible Students](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible_Student_movement "Bible Student movement") associated with [Charles Taze Russell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Taze_Russell "Charles Taze Russell") as his people in 1919. They also believe that the destruction of those who reject the Bible's message[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-60) and thus willfully refuse to obey God[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-61)[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-62) will shortly take place at [Armageddon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armageddon#Jehovah's_Witnesses "Armageddon"), ensuring that the beginning of the new earthly society will be composed of willing subjects of that kingdom.

The religion's doctrines surrounding 1914 are the legacy of a series of emphatic claims regarding the years 1799,[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-indisputable-63) 1874,[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-indisputable-63) 1878,[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-OurFaith1875-64) 1914,[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-TheWatchtower-65) 1918[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-September-66) and 1925[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-MillionsNow-67) made in the [Watch Tower Society's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watch_Tower_Bible_and_Tract_Society_of_Pennsylvania "Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania") publications between 1879 and 1924. Claims about the significance of those years, including the presence of Jesus Christ, the beginning of the "last days", the destruction of worldly governments and the earthly resurrection of Jewish patriarchs, were successively abandoned.[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-68) In 1922 the society's principal magazine, _[The Watchtower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Watchtower "The Watchtower")_, described its chronology as "no stronger than its weakest link", but also claimed the chronological relationships to be "of divine origin and divinely corroborated... in a class by itself, absolutely and unqualifiedly correct"[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-69) and "indisputable facts",[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-indisputable-63) and repudiation of Russell's teachings was described as "equivalent to a repudiation of the Lord".[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-70)

The Watch Tower Society has acknowledged its early leaders promoted "incomplete, even inaccurate concepts".[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-71) The [Governing Body of Jehovah's Witnesses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governing_Body_of_Jehovah%27s_Witnesses "Governing Body of Jehovah's Witnesses") says that, unlike [Old Testament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Testament "Old Testament")[prophets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophet#Judaism "Prophet"), its interpretations of the Bible are not [inspired](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_inspiration "Biblical inspiration") or [infallible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_infallibility "Biblical infallibility").[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-72)[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-73)[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-74) It says that Bible prophecies can be fully understood only after their fulfillment, citing examples of biblical figures who did not understand the meaning of prophecies they received. Watch Tower Society literature often cites Proverbs 4:18, "The path of the righteous ones is like the bright light that is getting lighter and lighter until the day is firmly established" ([NWT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World_Translation_of_the_Holy_Scriptures "New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures")) to support their view that there would be an increase in knowledge during "the time of the end", and that this increase in knowledge needs adjustments. Watch Tower Society publications also say that unfulfilled expectations are partly due to eagerness for [God's Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God%27s_Kingdom "God's Kingdom") and that they do not call [their core beliefs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jehovah%27s_Witnesses_beliefs "Jehovah's Witnesses beliefs") into question.[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-75)[[76]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-76)[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-77)

##### The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eschatology&action=edit&section=20 "Edit section: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints")]

Members of [the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints") (LDS Church) believe there will be a Second Coming of Jesus to the earth at some time in the future. The LDS Church and its leaders do not make any predictions of the date of the Second Coming.

According to church doctrine, the true [gospel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel "Gospel") will be taught in all parts of the world prior to the Second Coming.[[78]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-Matthew_24:14-78) They also believe there will be increasing war, wickedness, earthquakes, hurricanes, and man-made disasters prior to the Second Coming.[[79]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-79) Disasters of all kind will happen before Christ comes.[[80]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-80) Upon the return of Jesus Christ, all people will be resurrected, the righteous in a first resurrection and the unrighteous in a second, later resurrection. Christ shall reign for a period of 1000 years, after which the Final Judgment will occur.

#### Realized eschatology

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eschatology&action=edit&section=21 "Edit section: Realized eschatology")]

[Realized eschatology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realized_eschatology "Realized eschatology") is a Christian eschatological theory that holds that the eschatological passages in the [New Testament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Testament "New Testament") do not refer to the future, but instead refer to the [ministry of Jesus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Jesus "Ministry of Jesus") and his lasting legacy.[[81]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-81)[[82]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-82)

Diagram of "Plain of Assembly" (_Ard al-Hashr)_ on the Day of Judgment, from an autograph manuscript of _Futuhat al-Makkiyya_ by [Sufi mystic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sufism "Sufism") and [Muslim philosopher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_philosophy "Islamic philosophy")[Ibn Arabi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Arabi "Ibn Arabi"), c. 1238. Shown are the 'Arsh ([Throne of God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throne_of_God "Throne of God")), pulpits for the righteous (al-Aminun), seven rows of [angels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel "Angel"), [Gabriel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel "Gabriel") (al-Ruh), A'raf (the Barrier), the [Pond of Abundance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pond_of_Abundance "Pond of Abundance"), al-Maqam al-Mahmud (the Praiseworthy Station; where the Islamic prophet [Muhammad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad "Muhammad") will stand to intercede for the faithful), Mizan (the Scale), [As-Sirāt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As-Sir%C4%81t "As-Sirāt") (the Bridge), [Jahannam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jahannam "Jahannam") (Hell), and [Marj al-Jannat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannah "Jannah") (Meadow of Paradise).[[83]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-83)

[Muslims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims "Muslims") believe there are three periods before the [Day of Judgment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yawmuddin "Yawmuddin") with some debate as to whether the periods could overlap.[[84]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-Mahdi2-84)[[85]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-Joel-85)[[86]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-Hooper-86)

Sunnis believe the dead will then stand in a grand assembly, awaiting a scroll detailing their righteous deeds, sinful acts and ultimate judgment.[[note 1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-87)[[87]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-muhammad59-88) Muhammad will be the first to be resurrected.[[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-89) Punishments will include _adhab_, or severe pain and embarrassment, and _khizy_ or shame.[[89]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-WimEoQ-90) There will also be a punishment of the grave between death and the resurrection.[[90]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-91) Several Sunni scholars explain some of the signs metaphorically.

Mainstream Islamic timeline

The signs of the coming end time are divided into [major and minor signs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_eschatology#Major_and_minor_signs "Islamic eschatology"): Following the second period, the third is said to be marked by the ten major signs known as _alamatu's-sa'ah al- kubra_ (The major signs of the end).[[note 2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-92) They are as follows:

1.   A huge black cloud of smoke (dukhan) will cover the earth.[[note 3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-auto-93)
2.   Three sinkings of the earth, one in the East.[[note 3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-auto-93)
3.   One sinking of the earth in the West.[[note 3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-auto-93)
4.   One sinking of the earth in Arabia.[[note 3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-auto-93)
5.   The false messiah—anti-Christ, [Masih ad-Dajjal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masih_ad-Dajjal "Masih ad-Dajjal")—shall appear with great powers as a one-eyed man with his right eye blind and deformed like a grape. Although believers will not be deceived, he will claim to be God, to hold the keys to heaven and hell, and will lead many astray.[[91]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-94) In reality, his heaven is hell, and his hell is heaven. The Dajjal will be followed by seventy thousand Jews of Isfahan wearing Persian shawls.[[note 4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-95)
6.   The [return](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_coming "Second coming") of [Isa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_in_Islam "Jesus in Islam") (Jesus), from the fourth sky, to kill Dajjal.[[92]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-96)
7.   [_Ya'jooj_ and _Ma'jooj_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gog_and_Magog "Gog and Magog") ([Gog and Magog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gog_and_Magog "Gog and Magog")), a Japhetic tribe of vicious beings who had been imprisoned by [Dhul-Qarnayn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhul-Qarnayn "Dhul-Qarnayn"), will break out. They will ravage the earth, drink all the water of [Lake Tiberias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Tiberias "Lake Tiberias"), and kill all believers in their way. Isa, [Imam Al-Mahdi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_al-Mahdi "Muhammad al-Mahdi"), and the believers with them will go to the top of a mountain and pray for the destruction of Gog and Magog. God eventually will send disease and worms to wipe them out.[[note 5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-97)[[93]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-98)
8.   The sun will rise from the West.[[94]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-99)[[95]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-100)[[96]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-101)
9.   The _[Dabbat al-ard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beast\_of\_the\_Earth "Beast of the Earth")_, or [Beast of the Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beast_of_the_Earth "Beast of the Earth"), will come out of the ground to talk to people.[[note 6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-102)
10.   The second blow of the trumpet will be sounded, the dead will return to life, and a fire will come out of [Yemen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen "Yemen") that shall gather all to Mahshar Al Qiy'amah (The Gathering for Judgment).[[97]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-Mahdi22-103)

Many of the signs shown above are shared by both Sunni and Shia beliefs, with some exceptions, e.g. [Imam Al-Mahdi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_al-Mahdi "Muhammad al-Mahdi") defeating [Al-Masih ad-Dajjal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Masih_ad-Dajjal "Al-Masih ad-Dajjal").

Concepts and terminology in [Shia eschatology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_eschatology#Shia_eschatology "Islamic eschatology") include [Mi'ad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mi%27ad "Mi'ad"), the [Occultation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occultation_(Islam) "Occultation (Islam)"), [Al-Yamani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Yamani_(Shiism) "Al-Yamani (Shiism)"), and [Sufyani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sufyani "Sufyani"). In [Twelver Shia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelver "Twelver")[narrations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadith "Hadith") about the last days, the literature largely revolves around [Muhammad al-Mahdi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_al-Mahdi "Muhammad al-Mahdi"), who is considered by many beliefs to be the true twelfth appointed successor to Muhammad. Muhammad al-Mahdi will help mankind against the deception by the _Dajjal_ who will try to get people in to a new world religion which is called "the great deception".[[98]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-104)[_[need quotation to verify](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability "Wikipedia:Verifiability")_]

[Ahmadiyya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmadiyya "Ahmadiyya") is considered distinct from mainstream Islam. In its writing, the present age has been witness to the evil of man and wrath of God, with war and natural disaster.[[99]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-105)[Ghulam Ahmad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirza_Ghulam_Ahmad "Mirza Ghulam Ahmad") is seen as the [promised Messiah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_coming "Second coming") and the [Mahdi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahdi "Mahdi"), fulfilling Islamic and Biblical prophecies, as well as scriptures of other religions such as Hinduism. His teaching will establish spiritual reform and establish an age of peace. This will continue for a thousand years, and will unify mankind under one faith.[[100]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-106)

Ahmadis believe that despite harsh and strong opposition and discrimination they will eventually be triumphant and their message vindicated both by Muslims and non-Muslims alike. Ahmadis also incorporate the eschatological views from other religions into their doctrine and believe Mirza Ghulam Ahmed falls into this sequence.[[101]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-107)

Bahá'í House of Worship, Delhi, India

In the [Baháʼí Faith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bah%C3%A1%CA%BC%C3%AD_Faith "Baháʼí Faith"), creation has neither a beginning nor an end;[[102]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-108) Baháʼís regard the eschatologies of other religions as symbolic. In Baháʼí belief, human time is marked by a series of [progressive revelations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_revelation_(Bah%C3%A1%CA%BC%C3%AD) "Progressive revelation (Baháʼí)") in which successive [messengers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifestation_of_God_(Bah%C3%A1%CA%BC%C3%AD_Faith) "Manifestation of God (Baháʼí Faith)") or prophets come from God.[[103]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-PSmith-109) The coming of each of these messengers is seen as the day of judgment to the adherents of the previous religion, who may choose to accept the new messenger and enter the "heaven" of belief, or denounce the new messenger and enter the "hell" of denial. In this view, the terms "heaven" and "hell" become symbolic terms for a person's spiritual progress and their nearness to or distance from God.[[103]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-PSmith-109) In Baháʼí belief, [Bahá'u'lláh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bah%C3%A1%27u%27ll%C3%A1h "Bahá'u'lláh") (1817–1892), the founder of the Baháʼí Faith, was the [Second Coming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Coming "Second Coming") of Christ and also the fulfilment of previous eschatological expectations of [Islam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam "Islam") and other major religions.[[104]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-110)

The inception of the Baháʼí Faith coincides with [Great Disappointment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Disappointment "Great Disappointment") of the Millerite prophecy in 1844.

[ʻAbdu'l-Bahá](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CA%BBAbdu%27l-Bah%C3%A1 "ʻAbdu'l-Bahá") taught that Armageddon would begin in 1914,[[105]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-111) but without a clear indication of its end date.[[106]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-112) Baháʼís believe that the mass martyrdom anticipated during the _End Times_ had already passed within the [historical context](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Bah%C3%A1%CA%BC%C3%ADs#Historical_context "Persecution of Baháʼís") of the Baháʼí Faith.[[107]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-113)[[108]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-114) Baháʼís expect their faith to be eventually embraced by the masses of the world, ushering in a [golden age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_age "Golden age").

[![Image 12](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Selassie_restored.jpg/250px-Selassie_restored.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Selassie_restored.jpg)

[Haile Selassie I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haile_Selassie_I "Haile Selassie I") is viewed as god incarnate in [Rastafari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rastafari "Rastafari").

Rastafari have a unique interpretation of end times, based on the [Old Testament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Testament "Old Testament") and the [Book of Revelation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Revelation "Book of Revelation"). They believe [Ethiopian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopia "Ethiopia") Emperor [Haile Selassie I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haile_Selassie_I "Haile Selassie I") to be God [incarnate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incarnate "Incarnate"), the _King of kings_ and _Lord of lords_ mentioned in Revelation 5:5. They saw the crowning of Selassie as the [second coming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_coming "Second coming"), and the [Second Italo-Ethiopian War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Italo-Ethiopian_War "Second Italo-Ethiopian War") as fulfillment of Revelation. There is also the expectation that Selassie will return for a day of judgment and bring home the "lost children of Israel", which in Rastafari refers to those taken from Africa through the [slave trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_slavery "History of slavery"). There will then be an era of peace and harmony at Mount [Zion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zion "Zion") in Africa.[[109]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-Brown-115)

The [Vaishnavite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaishnavite "Vaishnavite") tradition links contemporary Hindu eschatology to the figure of [Kalki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalki "Kalki"), the tenth and last [avatar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar "Avatar") of [Vishnu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vishnu "Vishnu"). Many Hindus believe that before [the age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_units_of_time "Hindu units of time") draws to a close, Kalki will reincarnate as [Shiva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiva "Shiva") and simultaneously dissolve and regenerate the universe. [Shaivites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaivism "Shaivism") hold the view that Shiva is incessantly destroying and creating the world.[[110]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-116)

In [Hindu eschatology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_eschatology "Hindu eschatology"), time is cyclic and consists of [kalpas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalpa_(aeon) "Kalpa (aeon)"). Each lasts 4.1–8.2 billion years, which is a period of one full day and night for [Brahma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahma "Brahma"), who will be alive for 311 trillion, 40 billion years. Within a _kalpa_ there are periods of [creation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahma "Brahma"), [preservation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vishnu "Vishnu") and [decline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiva "Shiva"). After this larger cycle, all of creation will contract to a [singularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_singularity "Gravitational singularity")[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] and then again will expand from that single point, as the [ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuga "Yuga") continue in a religious [fractal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal "Fractal") pattern.[[86]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-Hooper-86)[_[need quotation to verify](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability "Wikipedia:Verifiability")_]

Within the current kalpa, there are four epochs that encompass the cycle. They progress from a beginning of complete purity to a descent into total corruption. The last of the four ages is [Kali Yuga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kali_Yuga "Kali Yuga") (which most Hindus believe is the current time), characterized by quarrel, hypocrisy, impiety, violence and decay. The four pillars of dharma will be reduced to one, with truth being all that remains.[[111]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-117) As written in the [Gita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagavad_Gita "Bhagavad Gita"):[[112]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-118)

> _Yadā yadā hi dharmasya glānirbhavati Bhārata_
> 
> _Abhyutthānam adharmasya tadātmānam sṛjāmyaham_
> 
> 
> O descendant of Bharata, whenever there is a decline of religion and an increase in irreligion, at that time I manifest My eternally perfect form in this mundane world.

At this time of chaos, the final avatar, [Kalki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalki "Kalki"), endowed with eight superhuman faculties will appear on a white horse. Kalki will amass an army to "establish righteousness upon the earth" and leave "the minds of the people as pure as crystal."

At the completion of [Kali Yuga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kali_Yuga "Kali Yuga"), the next [Yuga Cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuga_Cycle "Yuga Cycle") will begin with a new [Satya Yuga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satya_Yuga "Satya Yuga"), in which all will once again be righteous with the reestablishment of dharma. This, in turn, will be followed by epochs of [Treta Yuga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treta_Yuga "Treta Yuga"), [Dvapara Yuga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvapara_Yuga "Dvapara Yuga") and again another Kali Yuga. This cycle will then repeat until the larger cycle of existence under [Brahma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahma "Brahma") returns to the [singularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_singularity "Gravitational singularity"),[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] and a new universe is born.[[109]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-Brown-115) The cycle of [birth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahma "Brahma"), [growth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vishnu "Vishnu"), [decay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiva "Shiva"), and renewal at the individual level finds its echo in the cosmic order, yet is affected by vagueries of divine intervention in Vaishnavite belief.

There is no classic account of beginning or end[[113]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-119) in Buddhism; Masao Abe attributes this to the absence of God.[[114]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-120)

History is embedded in the continuing process of [samsara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sa%E1%B9%83s%C4%81ra "Saṃsāra") or the "beginningless and endless cycles of birth-death-rebirth".[[115]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-121) Buddhists believe there is an end to things[[116]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-122) but it is not final because they are bound to be born again. However, the writers of [Mahayana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahayana "Mahayana") Buddhist scriptures establish a specific end-time account in Buddhist tradition: this describes the return of [Maitreya Buddha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maitreya_Buddha "Maitreya Buddha"), who would bring about an end to the world.[[117]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-123) This constitutes one of the two major branches of Buddhist eschatology, with the other being the [Sermon of the Seven Suns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sermon_of_the_seven_suns "Sermon of the seven suns"). End time in Buddhism could also involve a cultural eschatology covering "final things", which include the idea that [Sakyamuni Buddha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gautama_Buddha "Gautama Buddha")'s [dharma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharma "Dharma") will also come to an end.[[118]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-124)

The Buddha described his teachings disappearing five thousand years from when he preached them,[[119]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-125) corresponding approximately to the year 4300 since he was born in 623 BCE.[[120]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-126) At this time, knowledge of dharma will be lost as well. The last of his relics will be gathered in Bodh Gaya and cremated.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] There will be a new era in which the next Buddha Maitreya will appear, but it will be preceded by the degeneration of human society. This will be a period of greed, lust, poverty, ill will, violence, murder, impiety, physical weakness, sexual depravity and societal collapse, and even the Buddha himself will be forgotten.[[86]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-Hooper-86)

This will be followed by the coming of Maitreya when the teachings of [dharma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharma "Dharma") are forgotten. Maitreya was the first Bodhisattva around whom a cult developed, in approximately the third century CE.[[121]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-Britannica-127)

The earliest known mention of Maitreya occurs in the Cakkavatti, or Sihanada Sutta in [Digha Nikaya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digha_Nikaya "Digha Nikaya") 26 of the [Pali Canon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pali_Canon "Pali Canon"). In it, [Gautama Buddha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gautama_Buddha "Gautama Buddha") predicted his teachings of dharma would be forgotten after 5,000 years.

> At that period, brethren, there will arise in the world an Exalted One named Maitreya, Fully Awakened, abounding in wisdom and goodness, happy, with knowledge of the worlds, unsurpassed as a guide to mortals willing to be led, a teacher for gods and men, an Exalted One, a Buddha, even as I am now. He, by himself, will thoroughly know and see, as it were face to face, this universe, with Its worlds of the spirits, Its Brahmas and Its Maras, and Its world of recluses and Brahmins, of princes and peoples, even as I now, by myself, thoroughly know and see them.

— Digha Nikaya, 26

The text then foretells the birth of Maitreya Buddha in the city of [Ketumatī](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketumat%C4%AB "Ketumatī") in present-day [Benares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varanasi "Varanasi"), whose king will be the Cakkavattī Sankha. Sankha will live in the former palace of King Mahāpanadā, and will become a renunciate who follows Maitreya.[[122]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-128)[[123]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-129)

In Mahayana Buddhism, Maitreya will attain _[bodhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodhi "Bodhi")_ in seven days, the minimum period, by virtue of his many lifetimes of preparation. Once Buddha, he will rule over the Ketumati Pure Land, an earthly paradise sometimes associated with the Indian city of [Varanasi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varanasi "Varanasi") or Benares in present-day [Uttar Pradesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uttar_Pradesh "Uttar Pradesh"). In Mahayana Buddhism, the Buddha presides over a land of purity. For example, [Amitabha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amitabha "Amitabha") presides over Sukhavati, more popularly known as the "Western Paradise".[[124]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-130)

Bodhisattva Maitreya from the second-century Gandharan art period

A notable teaching he will rediscover is that of the ten non-virtuous deeds—killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying, divisive speech, abusive speech, idle speech, covetousness, harmful intent and wrong views. The ten virtuous deeds will replace them with the abandonment of each of these practices. [Edward Conze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Conze "Edward Conze") in his _Buddhist Scriptures_ (1959) gives an account of Maitreya:

> The Lord replied, 'Maitreya, the best of men, will then leave the [_Tuṣita_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tushita "Tushita") heavens and go for his last rebirth. As soon as he is born he will walk seven steps forward, and where he puts down his feet a jewel or a lotus will spring up. He will raise his eyes to the ten directions and will speak these words: "This is my last birth. There will be no rebirth after this one. Never will I come back here, but, all pure, I shall win Nirvana."'

— _Buddhist Scriptures_[[125]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-131)

Maitreya currently resides in [Tushita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tushita "Tushita"), but will come to [Jambudvipa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jambudvipa "Jambudvipa") when needed most as successor to the historic [Śākyamuni Buddha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9A%C4%81kyamuni_Buddha "Śākyamuni Buddha"). Maitreya will achieve complete enlightenment during his lifetime, and following this reawakening he will bring back the timeless teaching of [dharma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharma "Dharma") to this plane and rediscover [enlightenment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana_(concept) "Nirvana (concept)").[[126]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-Theravada_Buddhism_1988,_pages_83-85-132) The [Arya Maitreya Mandala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arya_Maitreya_Mandala "Arya Maitreya Mandala"), founded in 1933 by [Lama Anagarika Govinda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lama_Anagarika_Govinda "Lama Anagarika Govinda"), is based on the idea of Maitreya.

Maitreya eschatology forms the central canon of the [White Lotus Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Lotus_Societies "White Lotus Societies"), a religious and political movement which emerged in [Yuan China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuan_dynasty "Yuan dynasty").[[127]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-133) It later branched into the Chinese underground [criminal organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organized_crime "Organized crime") known as the [Triads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triad_(organized_crime) "Triad (organized crime)"), which exist today as an international underground criminal network. [_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

Note that no description of Maitreya occurs in any other sutta in the canon, casting doubt as to the authenticity of the scripture. In addition, sermons of the Buddha normally are in response to a question, or in a specific context, but this sutta has a beginning and an ending, and its content is quite different from the others. This has led some to conclude that the whole sutta is [apocryphal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocrypha "Apocrypha"), or tampered with.[[126]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-Theravada_Buddhism_1988,_pages_83-85-132)

#### Sermon of the Seven Suns

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eschatology&action=edit&section=32 "Edit section: Sermon of the Seven Suns")]

In his "Sermon of the Seven Suns" in the [Pali Canon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pali_Canon "Pali Canon"), the Buddha describes the ultimate fate of the [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth") in an apocalypse characterized by the consequent appearance of seven [suns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun "Sun") in the sky, each causing progressive ruin until the planet is destroyed:

> All things are impermanent, all aspects of existence are unstable and non-eternal. Beings will become so weary and disgusted with the constituent things that they will seek emancipation from them more quickly. There will come a season, O monks when, after hundreds of thousands of years, rains will cease. All seedlings, all vegetation, all plants, grasses and trees will dry up and cease to be....There comes another season after a great lapse of time when a second sun will appear. Now all brooks and ponds will dry up, vanish, cease to be.

— Aňguttara-Nikăya, VII, 6.2 Pali Canon[[86]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-Hooper-86)

The canon goes on to describe the progressive destruction of each sun. The third sun will dry the [Ganges River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganges_River "Ganges River") and other rivers, whilst the fourth will cause the lakes to evaporate; the fifth will dry the oceans. Later:

> Again after a vast period of time a sixth sun will appear, and it will bake the Earth even as a pot is baked by a potter. All the mountains will reek and send up clouds of smoke. After another great interval a seventh sun will appear and the Earth will blaze with fire until it becomes one mass of flame. The mountains will be consumed, a spark will be carried on the wind and go to the worlds of God....Thus, monks, all things will burn, perish and exist no more except those who have seen the path.

— Aňguttara-Nikăya, VII, 6.2 Pali Canon[[86]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-Hooper-86)

The sermon completes with the Earth immersed into an extensive holocaust. The Pali Canon does not indicate when this will happen relative to Maitreya.[[86]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-Hooper-86)

[![Image 14](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Odin_und_Fenriswolf_Freyr_und_Surt.jpg/250px-Odin_und_Fenriswolf_Freyr_und_Surt.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Odin_und_Fenriswolf_Freyr_und_Surt.jpg)

[Norse mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norse_mythology "Norse mythology") depicts the end of days as _[Ragnarök](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragnar%C3%B6k "Ragnarök")_, an [Old Norse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Norse "Old Norse") term translatable as "twilight of the gods". It will be heralded by a devastation known as [Fimbulvetr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fimbulvetr "Fimbulvetr") which will seize [Midgard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midgard "Midgard") in cold and darkness. The sun and moon will disappear from the sky, and poison will fill the air. The dead will rise from the ground and there will be widespread despair.

Then there will be a battle between—on the one hand—the Gods with the [Æsir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%86sir "Æsir"), [Vanir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanir "Vanir")[[128]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-134) and [Einherjar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einherjar "Einherjar"), led by [Odin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odin "Odin"), and—on the other hand—forces of Chaos, including the fire giants and [jötunn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%B6tunn "Jötunn"), led by [Loki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loki "Loki"). In the fighting Odin will be swallowed whole by his old nemesis [Fenrir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenrir "Fenrir").[[129]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-LARRINGTON266-135) The god [Freyr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freyr "Freyr") fights [Surtr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surtr "Surtr") but loses. [Víðarr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C3%AD%C3%B0arr "Víðarr"), son of Odin, will then avenge his father by ripping Fenrir's jaws apart and stabbing the wolf in the heart with his spear. The serpent [Jörmungandr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%B6rmungandr "Jörmungandr") will open its gaping maw and be met in combat by [Thor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thor "Thor"). Thor, also a son of Odin, will defeat the serpent, only to take nine steps afterwards before collapsing in his own death.[[130]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-136)

After this people will flee their homes as the sun blackens and the earth sinks into the sea. The stars will vanish, steam will rise, and flames will touch the heavens. This conflict will result in the deaths of most of the major Gods and forces of Chaos. Finally, Surtr will fling fire across the nine worlds. The ocean will then completely submerge [Midgard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midgard "Midgard").[[131]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-137)

After the [cataclysm](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cataclysm "wikt:cataclysm"), the world will resurface new and fertile, and the surviving Gods will meet. [Baldr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldr "Baldr"), another son of Odin, will be reborn in the new world, according to [Völuspá](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C3%B6lusp%C3%A1 "Völuspá"). The two human survivors, [Líf and Lífþrasir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%ADf_and_L%C3%ADf%C3%BErasir "Líf and Lífþrasir"), will then repopulate this new earth.[[132]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-Odin-138)

Egyptian texts typically treat the dissolution of the world as a possibility to be avoided, and for that reason they do not often describe it in detail. However, many texts allude to the idea that the world, after countless cycles of renewal, is destined to end. This end is described in a passage in the _Coffin Texts_ and a more explicit one in the _Book of the Dead_, in which Atum says that he will one day dissolve the ordered world and return to his primeval, inert state within the waters of chaos. All things other than the creator will cease to exist, except Osiris, who will survive along with him.[[133]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHornung1982162%E2%80%93165-139) Details about this **eschathological** prospect are left unclear, including the fate of the dead who are associated with Osiris.[[134]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDunandZivie-Coche200467%E2%80%9368-140) Yet with the creator god and the god of renewal together in the waters that gave rise to the orderly world, there is the potential for a new creation to arise in the same manner as the old.[[135]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMeeksFavard-Meeks199618%E2%80%9319-141)

The Taoist faith is not concerned with what came before or after life, knowing only their own being in the Tao. The philosophy is that people come and go, just like mountains, trees and stars, but Tao will go on for [time immemorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_immemorial "Time immemorial").[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

Analogies in science and philosophy

Researchers in [futures studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_studies "Futures studies") and [transhumanists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhumanists "Transhumanists") investigate how the accelerating rate of scientific progress may lead to a "[technological singularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity "Technological singularity")" in the future that would profoundly and unpredictably change the course of human history, and result in _Homo sapiens_ no longer being the dominant life form on Earth.[[136]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-agi-conf-142)[[137]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-hplusmagazine-143)[_[improper synthesis?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No\_original\_research#Synthesis\_of\_published\_material "Wikipedia:No original research")_]

Occasionally the term "physical eschatology" is applied to the long-term predictions of astrophysics about the [future of Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_of_Earth "Future of Earth") and [ultimate fate of the universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_fate_of_the_universe "Ultimate fate of the universe").[[138]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-144)[[139]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-145) In approximately 6 billion years, the [Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun#Life_phases "Sun") will turn into a [red giant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_giant "Red giant"). Life on Earth will become impossible due to a rise in temperature long before the planet is possibly actually swallowed up by the Sun or left charred.[[140]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology#cite_note-zeilik-146) Later, the Sun will become a [white dwarf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_dwarf "White dwarf").
