**Vector calculus** or **vector analysis** is a branch of mathematics concerned with the [differentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative "Derivative") and [integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral "Integral") of [vector fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_field "Vector field"), primarily in three-dimensional [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space"), ![Image 1: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b00b2b4fd27c2cbffa02df568472f77b194a6db9)[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_calculus#cite_note-1) The term _vector calculus_ is sometimes used as a synonym for the broader subject of [multivariable calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariable_calculus "Multivariable calculus"), which spans vector calculus as well as [partial differentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_derivative "Partial derivative") and [multiple integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_integral "Multiple integral"). Vector calculus plays an important role in [differential geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry "Differential geometry") and in the study of [partial differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation "Partial differential equation"). It is used extensively in physics and engineering, especially in the description of [electromagnetic fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_field "Electromagnetic field"), [gravitational fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_field "Gravitational field"), and [fluid flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_flow "Fluid flow").

Vector calculus was developed from the theory of [quaternions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion "Quaternion") by [J. Willard Gibbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Willard_Gibbs "J. Willard Gibbs") and [Oliver Heaviside](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Heaviside "Oliver Heaviside") near the end of the 19th century, and most of the notation and terminology was established by Gibbs and [Edwin Bidwell Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Bidwell_Wilson "Edwin Bidwell Wilson") in their 1901 book, _[Vector Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector\_Analysis "Vector Analysis")_, though earlier mathematicians such as [Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton") pioneered the field.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_calculus#cite_note-:17-2) In its standard form using the [cross product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_product "Cross product"), vector calculus does not generalize to higher dimensions, but the alternative approach of [geometric algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_algebra "Geometric algebra"), which uses the [exterior product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exterior_algebra "Exterior algebra"), does (see _[§Generalizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector\_calculus#Generalizations)_ below for more).

A [scalar field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_field "Scalar field") associates a [scalar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_(mathematics) "Scalar (mathematics)") value to every point in a space. The scalar is a mathematical number representing a [physical quantity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_(physics) "Scalar (physics)"). Examples of scalar fields in applications include the [temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature "Temperature") distribution throughout space, the [pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure "Pressure") distribution in a fluid, and spin-zero quantum fields (known as [scalar bosons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_boson "Scalar boson")), such as the [Higgs field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_field "Higgs field"). These fields are the subject of [scalar field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_field_theory "Scalar field theory").

A [vector field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_field "Vector field") is an assignment of a [vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(geometry) "Vector (geometry)") to each point in a [space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(mathematics) "Space (mathematics)").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_calculus#cite_note-Galbis-2012-p12-3) A vector field in the plane, for instance, can be visualized as a collection of arrows with a given [magnitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnitude_(mathematics)#Vector_spaces "Magnitude (mathematics)") and direction each attached to a point in the plane. Vector fields are often used to model, for example, the speed and direction of a moving fluid throughout space, or the strength and direction of some [force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force "Force"), such as the [magnetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field "Magnetic field") or [gravitational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity "Gravity") force, as it changes from point to point. This can be used, for example, to calculate [work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(physics) "Work (physics)") done over a line.

### Vectors and pseudovectors

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vector_calculus&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Vectors and pseudovectors")]

In more advanced treatments, one further distinguishes [pseudovector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudovector "Pseudovector") fields and [pseudoscalar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoscalar "Pseudoscalar") fields, which are identical to vector fields and scalar fields, except that they change sign under an orientation-reversing map: for example, the [curl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curl_(mathematics) "Curl (mathematics)") of a vector field is a pseudovector field, and if one reflects a vector field, the curl points in the opposite direction. This distinction is clarified and elaborated in [geometric algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_algebra "Geometric algebra"), as described below.

The algebraic (non-differential) operations in vector calculus are referred to as _vector algebra_, being defined for a vector space and then applied [pointwise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointwise "Pointwise") to a vector field. The basic algebraic operations consist of:

### Differential operators

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vector_calculus&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Differential operators")]

Vector calculus studies various [differential operators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_operator "Differential operator") defined on scalar or vector fields, which are typically expressed in terms of the [del](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Del "Del") operator (![Image 9: {\displaystyle \nabla }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a3d0e93b78c50237f9ea83d027e4ebbdaef354b2)), also known as "nabla". The three basic [vector operators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_operator "Vector operator") are:[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_calculus#cite_note-4)

Differential operators in vector calculus | Operation | Notation | Description | [Notational analogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notation_for_differentiation#Notation_in_vector_calculus "Notation for differentiation") | Domain/Range |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Gradient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient "Gradient") | ![Image 10: {\displaystyle \operatorname {grad} (f)=\nabla f}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b517049589594ba096c7fefdab14f77db1daf633) | Measures the rate and direction of change in a scalar field. | [Scalar multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_multiplication "Scalar multiplication") | Maps scalar fields to vector fields. |
| [Divergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergence "Divergence") | ![Image 11: {\displaystyle \operatorname {div} (\mathbf {F} )=\nabla \cdot \mathbf {F} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2533874053892e3a3aa2f74c447ed709e1b7a429) | Measures the scalar of a source or sink at a given point in a vector field. | [Dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product "Dot product") | Maps vector fields to scalar fields. |

| f denotes a scalar field and F denotes a vector field |

Also commonly used are the two Laplace operators:

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Laplacian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace_operator "Laplace operator") | ![Image 14: {\displaystyle \Delta f=\nabla ^{2}f=\nabla \cdot \nabla f}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/39ac1d40b8b92a61a97633f5ca6dfc12cf0b8d0b) | Measures the difference between the value of the scalar field with its average on infinitesimal balls. | Maps between scalar fields. |
| [Vector Laplacian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_Laplacian "Vector Laplacian") | ![Image 15: {\displaystyle \nabla ^{2}\mathbf {F} =\nabla (\nabla \cdot \mathbf {F} )-\nabla \times (\nabla \times \mathbf {F} )}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a55ba486714656cba6ebf9c4f511fddc709b747f) | Measures the difference between the value of the vector field with its average on infinitesimal balls. | Maps between vector fields. |
| f denotes a scalar field and F denotes a vector field |

A quantity called the [Jacobian matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobian_matrix_and_determinant "Jacobian matrix and determinant") is useful for studying functions when both the domain and range of the function are multivariable, such as a [change of variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_of_variables "Change of variables") during integration.

The three basic vector operators have corresponding theorems which generalize the [fundamental theorem of calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_calculus "Fundamental theorem of calculus") to higher dimensions:

Integral theorems of vector calculus | Theorem | Statement | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Gradient theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_theorem "Gradient theorem") | ![Image 16: {\displaystyle \int _{L\subset \mathbb {R} ^{n}}\!\!\!\nabla \varphi \cdot d\mathbf {r} \ =\ \varphi \left(\mathbf {q} \right)-\varphi \left(\mathbf {p} \right)\ \ {\text{ for }}\ \ L=L[p\to q]}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e6256210d4ba35dd4b15ebac17aaa3445b8ee38a) | The [line integral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_integral "Line integral") of the gradient of a scalar field over a [curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve "Curve")_L_ is equal to the change in the scalar field between the endpoints _p_ and _q_ of the curve. |
| [Divergence theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergence_theorem "Divergence theorem") | ![Image 17: {\displaystyle \underbrace {\int \!\cdots \!\int _{V\subset \mathbb {R} ^{n}}} _{n}(\nabla \cdot \mathbf {F} )\,dV\ =\ \underbrace {\oint \!\cdots \!\oint _{\partial V}} _{n-1}\mathbf {F} \cdot d\mathbf {S} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/33d38776286fbe2d145abb2601ab077e110239ff) | The integral of the divergence of a vector field over an n-dimensional solid _V_ is equal to the [flux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flux "Flux") of the vector field through the (_n_−1)-dimensional closed boundary surface of the solid. |
| [Curl (Kelvin–Stokes) theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin%E2%80%93Stokes_theorem "Kelvin–Stokes theorem") | ![Image 18: {\displaystyle \iint _{\Sigma \subset \mathbb {R} ^{3}}(\nabla \times \mathbf {F} )\cdot d\mathbf {\Sigma } \ =\ \oint _{\partial \Sigma }\mathbf {F} \cdot d\mathbf {r} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a2ffdf9ab3c5143512764ceeb91ecf38eb7bb68a) | The integral of the curl of a vector field over a [surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(topology) "Surface (topology)")Σ in ![Image 19: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f936ddf584f8f3dd2a0ed08917001b7a404c10b5) is equal to the circulation of the vector field around the closed curve bounding the surface. |

In two dimensions, the divergence and curl theorems reduce to the Green's theorem:

Green's theorem of vector calculus | Theorem | Statement | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Green's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green%27s_theorem "Green's theorem") | ![Image 21: {\displaystyle \iint _{A\,\subset \mathbb {R} ^{2}}\left({\frac {\partial M}{\partial x}}-{\frac {\partial L}{\partial y}}\right)dA\ =\ \oint _{\partial A}\left(L\,dx+M\,dy\right)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/da3576195de9292216bf214cd13b59574b1bf2c3) | The integral of the divergence (or curl) of a vector field over some region _A_ in ![Image 22: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e150115ab9f63023215109595b76686a1ff890fd) equals the flux (or circulation) of the vector field over the closed curve bounding the region. |
| For divergence, _F_ = (_M_, −_L_). For curl, _F_ = (_L_, _M_, 0). L and M are functions of (_x_, _y_). |

### Linear approximations

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vector_calculus&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Linear approximations")]

Linear approximations are used to replace complicated functions with linear functions that are almost the same. Given a differentiable function _f_(_x_, _y_) with real values, one can approximate _f_(_x_, _y_) for (_x_, _y_) close to (_a_, _b_) by the formula

![Image 23: {\displaystyle f(x,y)\ \approx \ f(a,b)+{\tfrac {\partial f}{\partial x}}(a,b)\,(x-a)+{\tfrac {\partial f}{\partial y}}(a,b)\,(y-b).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9b626a517470065bc0444b93c9b0e4d03e2389d1)
The right-hand side is the equation of the plane tangent to the graph of _z_ = _f_(_x_, _y_) at (_a_, _b_).

For a continuously differentiable [function of several real variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_of_several_real_variables "Function of several real variables"), a point _P_ (that is, a set of values for the input variables, which is viewed as a point in **R**_n_) is **critical** if all of the [partial derivatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_derivative "Partial derivative") of the function are zero at _P_, or, equivalently, if its [gradient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient "Gradient") is zero. The critical values are the values of the function at the critical points.

If the function is [smooth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_function "Smooth function"), or, at least twice continuously differentiable, a critical point may be either a [local maximum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_maximum "Local maximum"), a [local minimum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_minimum "Local minimum") or a [saddle point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddle_point "Saddle point"). The different cases may be distinguished by considering the [eigenvalues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalue "Eigenvalue") of the [Hessian matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hessian_matrix "Hessian matrix") of second derivatives.

By [Fermat's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_theorem_(stationary_points) "Fermat's theorem (stationary points)"), all local [maxima and minima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxima_and_minima "Maxima and minima") of a differentiable function occur at critical points. Therefore, to find the local maxima and minima, it suffices, theoretically, to compute the zeros of the gradient and the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix at these zeros.

Vector calculus can also be generalized to other [3-manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-manifolds "3-manifolds") and [higher-dimensional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_dimension "Higher dimension") spaces.

### Different 3-manifolds

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vector_calculus&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Different 3-manifolds")]

Vector calculus is initially defined for [Euclidean 3-space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space"), ![Image 24: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/deb17c1074c77de2cf88d45bcd6d7a795b0f5d44) which has additional structure beyond simply being a 3-dimensional real vector space, namely: a [norm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(mathematics) "Norm (mathematics)") (giving a notion of length) defined via an [inner product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_product "Inner product") (the [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product "Dot product")), which in turn gives a notion of angle, and an [orientation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientability "Orientability"), which gives a notion of left-handed and right-handed. These structures give rise to a [volume form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume_form "Volume form"), and also the [cross product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_product "Cross product"), which is used pervasively in vector calculus.

The gradient and divergence require only the inner product, while the curl and the cross product also requires the handedness of the [coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_system "Coordinate system") to be taken into account.

Vector calculus can be defined on other 3-dimensional real vector spaces if they have an inner product (or more generally a symmetric [nondegenerate form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondegenerate_form "Nondegenerate form")) and an orientation; this is less data than an isomorphism to Euclidean space, as it does not require a set of coordinates (a frame of reference), which reflects the fact that vector calculus is invariant under rotations (the [special orthogonal group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_orthogonal_group "Special orthogonal group")SO(3)).

More generally, vector calculus can be defined on any 3-dimensional oriented [Riemannian manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_manifold "Riemannian manifold"), or more generally [pseudo-Riemannian manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo-Riemannian_manifold "Pseudo-Riemannian manifold"). This structure simply means that the [tangent space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_space "Tangent space") at each point has an inner product (more generally, a symmetric nondegenerate form) and an orientation, or more globally that there is a symmetric nondegenerate [metric tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_tensor "Metric tensor") and an orientation, and works because vector calculus is defined in terms of tangent vectors at each point.

Most of the analytic results are easily understood, in a more general form, using the machinery of [differential geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry "Differential geometry"), of which vector calculus forms a subset. Grad and div generalize immediately to other dimensions, as do the gradient theorem, divergence theorem, and Laplacian (yielding [harmonic analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_analysis "Harmonic analysis")), while curl and cross product do not generalize as directly.

From a general point of view, the various fields in (3-dimensional) vector calculus are uniformly seen as being _k_-vector fields: scalar fields are 0-vector fields, vector fields are 1-vector fields, pseudovector fields are 2-vector fields, and pseudoscalar fields are 3-vector fields. In higher dimensions there are additional types of fields (scalar, vector, pseudovector or pseudoscalar corresponding to 0, 1, _n_ − 1 or _n_ dimensions, which is exhaustive in dimension 3), so one cannot only work with (pseudo)scalars and (pseudo)vectors.

In any dimension, assuming a nondegenerate form, grad of a scalar function is a vector field, and div of a vector field is a scalar function, but only in dimension 3 or 7[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_calculus#cite_note-5) (and, trivially, in dimension 0 or 1) is the curl of a vector field a vector field, and only in 3 or [7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven-dimensional_cross_product "Seven-dimensional cross product") dimensions can a cross product be defined (generalizations in other dimensionalities either require ![Image 25: {\displaystyle n-1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fbd0b0f32b28f51962943ee9ede4fb34198a2521) vectors to yield 1 vector, or are alternative [Lie algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_algebra "Lie algebra"), which are more general antisymmetric bilinear products). The generalization of grad and div, and how curl may be generalized is elaborated at _[Curl § Generalizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curl\_(mathematics)#Generalizations "Curl (mathematics)")_; in brief, the curl of a vector field is a [bivector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bivector "Bivector") field, which may be interpreted as the [special orthogonal Lie algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_orthogonal_Lie_algebra "Special orthogonal Lie algebra") of infinitesimal rotations; however, this cannot be identified with a vector field because the dimensions differ – there are 3 dimensions of rotations in 3 dimensions, but 6 dimensions of rotations in 4 dimensions (and more generally ![Image 26: {\displaystyle \textstyle {{\binom {n}{2}}={\frac {1}{2}}n(n-1)}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e9452c4e598426ab76ad499c179035acd97fd226) dimensions of rotations in _n_ dimensions).

There are two important alternative generalizations of vector calculus. The first, [geometric algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_algebra "Geometric algebra"), uses [_k_-vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivector "Multivector") fields instead of vector fields (in 3 or fewer dimensions, every _k_-vector field can be identified with a scalar function or vector field, but this is not true in higher dimensions). This replaces the cross product, which is specific to 3 dimensions, taking in two vector fields and giving as output a vector field, with the [exterior product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exterior_product "Exterior product"), which exists in all dimensions and takes in two vector fields, giving as output a bivector (2-vector) field. This product yields [Clifford algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_algebra "Clifford algebra") as the algebraic structure on vector spaces (with an orientation and nondegenerate form). Geometric algebra is mostly used in generalizations of physics and other applied fields to higher dimensions.

The second generalization uses [differential forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_form "Differential form") (_k_-covector fields) instead of vector fields or _k_-vector fields, and is widely used in mathematics, particularly in [differential geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry "Differential geometry"), [geometric topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_topology "Geometric topology"), and [harmonic analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_analysis "Harmonic analysis"), in particular yielding [Hodge theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodge_theory "Hodge theory") on oriented pseudo-Riemannian manifolds. From this point of view, grad, curl, and div correspond to the [exterior derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exterior_derivative "Exterior derivative") of 0-forms, 1-forms, and 2-forms, respectively, and the key theorems of vector calculus are all special cases of the general form of [Stokes' theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stokes%27_theorem "Stokes' theorem").

From the point of view of both of these generalizations, vector calculus implicitly identifies mathematically distinct objects, which makes the presentation simpler but the underlying mathematical structure and generalizations less clear. From the point of view of geometric algebra, vector calculus implicitly identifies _k_-vector fields with vector fields or scalar functions: 0-vectors and 3-vectors with scalars, 1-vectors and 2-vectors with vectors. From the point of view of differential forms, vector calculus implicitly identifies _k_-forms with scalar fields or vector fields: 0-forms and 3-forms with scalar fields, 1-forms and 2-forms with vector fields. Thus for example the curl naturally takes as input a vector field or 1-form, but naturally has as output a 2-vector field or 2-form (hence pseudovector field), which is then interpreted as a vector field, rather than directly taking a vector field to a vector field; this is reflected in the curl of a vector field in higher dimensions not having as output a vector field.
