It is located on Haleakala 's east rift zone , at the border between Hāna Forest Reserve and Haleakalā National Park . It is alleged to be one of the wettest places on Earth , with a reported annual rainfall of 404 inches (10,300 mm) [ 1 ] for the period 1992-2018 according to the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa .

While the summit of Mount Waiʻaleʻale on Kauai has long been considered the wettest place in the Hawaiian Islands, and was claimed to be the second wettest place on Earth, [ 2 ] its NOAA -reported annual rainfall of 373.85 inches (9,495.8 mm) [ 3 ] is exceeded by Big Bog's 30-year average.

Climate [ edit ] The Big Bog has a tropical rainforest climate (Köppen Af ), with no observable dry season and nearly constant torrential rainfall. Prior to the establishment of the station there in 1992, rainfall for Big Bog was estimated at around 4,600 millimetres (180 in) per year. However, the first full year of recorded data showed 13,995 millimetres (551.0 in) of rainfall, which is one of the highest annual rainfall totals measured in the Hawaiian Islands.

[ 4 ] Since then, the annual average has been recorded as 404 inches (10,300 mm). Clear days are essentially nonexistent, and even when it is not raining, it is almost certainly cloudy or foggy. The lack of adequate drainage has caused moisture to accumulate, forming the bog.

These trade winds condense to form clouds and precipitation. Its reputation as the cloudiest place in the Hawaiian Islands is supported by its average solar radiation and potential evapotranspiration being the lowest amongst recorded locations in the state, and relative humidity and cloud attenuation the highest.
