An Introduction to Mechanics , commonly referred to as Kleppner and Kolenkow , is an undergraduate level textbook on classical mechanics coauthored by physicists Daniel Kleppner and Robert J. Kolenkow . It originated as the textbook for a one- semester mechanics course at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , where both Kleppner and Kolenkow taught, intended to go deeper than an ordinary first year course.

[ 2 ] Since its introduction, it has expanded its reach to other universities to become one of the most popular mechanics textbooks.

[ citation needed ] The first edition was published in 1973 by McGraw Hill and republished in 2010 by Cambridge University .

[ 3 ] The second edition was published in 2013 by Cambridge.
