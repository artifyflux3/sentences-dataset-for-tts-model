The show is about four extraterrestrials who are on an expedition to Earth, the third planet from the Sun, which they consider to be a very insignificant planet. The extraterrestrials pose as a human family to observe the behavior of human beings.

The show premiered three years after the film Coneheads , which was also written by the Turners, and featured a similar premise of extraterrestrials arriving on Earth and assimilating into American society.

Overview [ edit ] The premise of the show revolves around an extraterrestrial research expedition hailing from a planet in a barred spiral galaxy on the Cepheus - Draco border attempting to live as a normal human family in the fictional city of Rutherford, Ohio , said to be 52 mi (84 km) outside of Cleveland , where they live in an attic apartment . The show's humor is principally derived from the aliens' attempts to study human society and understand the human condition , while living as humans on Earth, reflecting on human life from the perspective of aliens. Most of the episodes are named after the protagonist, Dick. In later episodes, they have become more accustomed to Earth and are often more interested in their human lives than in their mission.

The show also takes humor from its mirroring of all human anthropological expeditions and their assumptions of superiority to the "natives", as well as their inability to distinguish themselves from the natives. Dr.

Mary Albright ( Jane Curtin ) is a professor of anthropology at fictional Pendelton State University, and many of the issues with which the four aliens struggle appear in her conversation and work. Furthermore, these four alien researchers end up looking approximately like joyriders as they get drawn increasingly further into human life.

Dick Solomon ( John Lithgow ), the High Commander and leader of the expedition, is the family provider and a physics professor at Pendelton (with Lithgow's eldest son Ian playing Leon, one of his less-successful students). Information officer and oldest member of the crew Tommy ( Joseph Gordon-Levitt ) has been given the body of a teenager and is forced to enroll in high school (later college), leaving security officer Sally ( Kristen Johnston ) and "the one with the transmitter in his head", Harry ( French Stewart ), to spend their lives as 20-somethings hanging out at home and bouncing through short-term jobs. The show also involves their relationships with humans, mostly their love interests.

The family often communicates through Harry with their off-world (and usually unseen) boss, the Big Giant Head , who when he finally visits Earth, is played by William Shatner . Harry unexpectedly (and often in inconvenient circumstances) stands up, his arms stiff (acting as the antenna), and proclaims: "Incoming message from the Big Giant Head!"

During season one, James Earl Jones provided a voice introduction describing the crew. For Christmas episodes, jingle bells were added to the theme. The only major change to the theme was in season five, when the original Ben Vaughn version was replaced by a big band version of the theme, performed by the group Big Bad Voodoo Daddy , and was only used during that season. For the sixth and final season, the original theme returned other than two episodes that used a modern jazz version of the song.

Title sequence [ edit ] The opening title sequence, which was produced by the London graphic design firm SVC Television, opens with computerized shots of planets and celestial bodies, some either with the planets dancing or moving in warp speed. It opens and closes with a shot of Earth (which at the open is where the show's title logo appears, after a sunburst appears on the side of Earth). For the sixth and final season only, the typeface of the cast and creators' names was altered.

[ 55 ] Golden Globe Awards 1997 — Best Actor in a Television Comedy or Musical — John Lithgow Screen Actors Guild Awards 1996, 1997 — Best Male Actor — Comedy Series — John Lithgow Other media [ edit ] A tie-in book, 3rd Rock from the Sun: The Official Report on Earth , was released in 1997. It is essentially a report of the Solomons' findings during their stay on Earth. Primarily a source of humor, the book includes such features as "What to do if you encounter Jell-O", a fan biography of Katie Couric written by Harry, and Sally's version of a Cosmo quiz. Portions of the book are included in the booklets inside each season set of the series.

Despite the report's being set within the fictional world of 3rd Rock , a foreword written by John Lithgow himself is included in which he explains how he was abducted by the 3rd Rock producers and forced to work on their production. A Post-it note is attached to the foreword, apparently written by Dick Solomon, stating  he does not know why the foreword is there, but that Lithgow is an Earth actor who appeared in " some helicopter movie ".
