[ 1 ] The name Methanohalophilus is said to be derived from methanum meaning " methane " in Latin ; halo meaning " salt " in Greek ; and mahii meaning "of Mah" in Latin, after R.A. Mah, who did substantial amounts of research on aerobic and methanogenic microbes .

[ 2 ] The proper word in ancient Greek for "salt" is however hals (ἅλς).

[ 3 ] The specific strain type was designated SLP (= ATCC 35705) and is currently the only identified strain of this species.

[ 2 ] Phylogeny [ edit ] There are a total of four species in the genus Methanohalophilus including Methanohalophilus mahii , Methanohalophilus halophilus , Methanohalophilus portucalensis , and Methanohalophilus euhalobius.

[ 1 ] The closest relative, Methanohalophilus portucalensis , has a 99.8% similarity in sequence across the whole genome to Methanohalophilus mahii .

[ 1 ] The other Methanohalophilus species have less than a 94.7% similarity to Methanohalophilus mahii .

[ 1 ] All species in the genus are halophilic methanogens that contribute to marine ecosystem mineral cycling.

[ 1 ] Discovery [ edit ] In 1988, Robert Paterek and Paul Smith were searching for methanogenic bacteria in the Great Salt Lake in Utah when they first discovered the archaeon Methanohalophilus mahii in its anoxic sediments .

[ 2 ] Sediment samples were collected and stored in plexiglas tubes, and sub-core samples taken with a brass cork borer and transferred to fifty milliliter serum bottles.

[ 4 ] All samples were processed within forty-eight hours of collection.

[ 4 ] The media used for isolation of Methanohalophilus mahii colonies was prepared using the Hungate technique for proper isolation of anaerobic microbes.

[ 4 ] Serial dilutions were prepared in a 1:10 ratio, [ 4 ] and agar roll tubes were inoculated and incubated at 30 °C for eight weeks.

[ 4 ] Isolated methanogenic colonies were chosen by identifying those with a foamy texture, denoting gas release, [ 1 ] and repeatedly diluted and inoculated on agar roll tubes until only one type of colony morphology remained.

[ 4 ] These colonies appeared as cream to pale yellow -colored circular -shaped colonies with an overall foamy texture due to gas release.

[ 2 ] Cell Culture [ edit ] Several analyses were done to determine cell characteristics.

[ 4 ] Methanohalophilus mahii is classified as a moderate halophile , or an organism that can grow in high salinity environments, since it can grow anywhere from a 0.5 to 3.5 M NaCl (about 30-200 g/L) range, [ 1 ] with an optimal growth concentration at 2.0 M (about 115-120 g/L) NaCl, [ 1 ] but with a 1.2 M NaCl (about 70 g/L) concentration yielding the highest culture density.

[ 1 ] It can also grow in varying pH levels ranging from 6.5 to 8.2, [ 1 ] with an optimum pH of 7.5.

[ 1 ] Methanohalophilus mahii is a mesophile , or an organism that thrives at moderate temperatures, and grows best at a temperature of 37 °C.

[ 2 ] Cell Structure [ edit ] Methanohalophilus mahii cells stain Gram negative , [ 1 ] and are non-motile, [ 2 ] irregular cocci [ 2 ] approximately 0.8 to 1.8 micrometers in diameter.

[ 2 ] Additionally, the cells fluoresce under 420 nanometer light.

[ 2 ] Membrane phospholipids are composed of β-hydroxyarchaeol cores, glucose glycolipids , and ethanolamine , glycerol , and myo-inositol polar head groups.

[ 1 ] Metabolism [ edit ] Methanohalophilus mahii is an obligately anaerobic [ 1 ] methylotrophic [ 2 ] and methanogenic chemoheterotroph , able to reduce single- carbon compounds and multi-carbon compounds given that there are no carbon-carbon double bonds present.

[ 1 ] Trace amounts of Mg 2 + , K + , Ca 2+ , and Fe 2+ ions are required for methanogenic growth.

[ 1 ] Methanol can be used independently as a carbon source, and the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas ( EMP ) glycolytic pathway can be utilized for catabolic processes.

[ 1 ] Possible electron donors include methanol , methylamines , dimethylamines , and trimethylamines .

[ 1 ] Methanohalophilus mahii is capable of utilizing several metabolic pathways to either reduce or oxidize methyl groups , creating either methane or carbon dioxide in the process.

[ 1 ] In the reductive methylotrophic methanogenic pathway, Methanohalophilus mahii can eventually reduce a methyl group to a methane, which is released.

[ 1 ] In the oxidative methylotrophic pathway, the methyl group is instead oxidized to carbon dioxide and released.

[ 1 ] This process directly contributes to carbon mineralization in marine ecosystems.

[ 1 ] Genome [ edit ] Methanohalophilus mahii’s genome was sequenced through shotgun sequencing using a 6.8 kilobase Sanger DNA library .

[ 1 ] The complete genome size was determined to be 2,012,424 base pairs long, with 2,906 total genes , and 2,032 actual protein-coding genes .

[ 1 ] The sequence had a 42.6% GC content , and forty-five pseudogenes were located.

[ 1 ] Importance [ edit ] Methanohalophilus mahii has a unique suppressor tRNA with a modified pyrrolysine , an amino acid that is most commonly found in prokaryotes , that can recognize and bind to the amber STOP codon (UAG) which is also coded for by the genes used for methylamine methyltransferases .

[ 1 ] This species was also the first member to have its genome completely sequenced in the genus Methanohalophilus [1] , which comprises mildly halophilic , methylotrophic methanogens .

[ 1 ] These archaea in general are known to greatly contribute to the carbon mineralization process in marine ecosystems.

[ 1 ] Specifically, the oxidative methylotrophic pathway Methanohalophilus mahii utilizes allows the species to oxidize methane to carbon dioxide , which, in turn, is used by other plants and organisms .

[ 1 ] This mineral cycling process allows for more growth and diversity in the ocean .
