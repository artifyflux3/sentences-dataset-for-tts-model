Dirichlet's unit theorem shows that the unit group has rank 1 exactly when the number field is a real quadratic field , a complex cubic field , or a totally imaginary quartic field . When the unit group has rank ≥ 1, a basis of it modulo its torsion is called a fundamental system of units .

[ 1 ] Some authors use the term fundamental unit to mean any element of a fundamental system of units, not restricting to the case of rank 1 (e.g.

Neukirch 1999 , p. 42).

Real quadratic fields [ edit ] For the real quadratic field K = Q ( d ) {\displaystyle K=\mathbf {Q} ({\sqrt {d}})} (with d square-free), the fundamental unit ε is commonly normalized so that ε > 1 (as a real number). Then it is uniquely characterized as the minimal unit among those that are greater than 1. If Δ denotes the discriminant of K , then the fundamental unit is ε ε = a + b Δ Δ 2 {\displaystyle \varepsilon ={\frac {a+b{\sqrt {\Delta }}}{2}}} where ( a , b ) is the smallest solution to [ 2 ] x 2 − − Δ Δ y 2 = ± ± 4 {\displaystyle x^{2}-\Delta y^{2}=\pm 4} in positive integers. This equation is basically Pell's equation or the negative Pell equation and its solutions can be obtained similarly using the continued fraction expansion of Δ Δ {\displaystyle {\sqrt {\Delta }}} .

Whether or not x 2 − Δ y 2 = −4 has a solution determines whether or not the class group of K is the same as its narrow class group , or equivalently, whether or not there is a unit of norm −1 in K . This equation is known to have a solution if, and only if, the period of the continued fraction expansion of Δ Δ {\displaystyle {\sqrt {\Delta }}} is odd. A simpler relation can be obtained using congruences: if Δ is divisible by a prime that is congruent to 3 modulo 4, then K does not have a unit of norm −1. However, the converse does not hold as shown by the example d = 34.

[ 3 ] In the early 1990s, Peter Stevenhagen proposed a probabilistic model that led him to a conjecture on how often the converse fails. Specifically, if D ( X ) is the number of real quadratic fields whose discriminant Δ < X is not divisible by a prime congruent to 3 modulo 4 and D − ( X ) is those who have a unit of norm −1, then [ 4 ] lim X → → ∞ ∞ D − − ( X ) D ( X ) = 1 − − ∏ ∏ j ≥ ≥ 1 odd ( 1 − − 2 − − j ) .

{\displaystyle \lim _{X\rightarrow \infty }{\frac {D^{-}(X)}{D(X)}}=1-\prod _{j\geq 1{\text{ odd}}}\left(1-2^{-j}\right).} In other words, the converse fails about 42% of the time. As of March 2012, a recent result towards this conjecture was provided by Étienne Fouvry and Jürgen Klüners [ 5 ] who show that the converse fails between 33% and 59% of the time.  In 2022, Peter Koymans and Carlo Pagano [ 6 ] claimed a complete proof of Stevenhagen's conjecture.

Cubic fields [ edit ] If K is a complex cubic field then it has a unique real embedding and the fundamental unit ε can be picked uniquely such that |ε| > 1 in this embedding. If the discriminant Δ of K satisfies |Δ| ≥ 33, then [ 7 ] ϵ ϵ 3 > | Δ Δ | − − 27 4 .

{\displaystyle \epsilon ^{3}>{\frac {|\Delta |-27}{4}}.} For example, the fundamental unit of Q ( 2 3 ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {Q} ({\sqrt[{3}]{2}})} is ϵ ϵ = 1 + 2 3 + 2 2 3 , {\displaystyle \epsilon =1+{\sqrt[{3}]{2}}+{\sqrt[{3}]{2^{2}}},} and ϵ ϵ 3 ≈ ≈ 56.9 {\displaystyle \epsilon ^{3}\approx 56.9} whereas the discriminant of this field is −108 thus | Δ Δ | − − 27 4 = 20.25 {\displaystyle {\frac {|\Delta |-27}{4}}=20.25} so ϵ ϵ 3 ≈ ≈ 56.9 > 20.25 {\displaystyle \epsilon ^{3}\approx 56.9>20.25} .
