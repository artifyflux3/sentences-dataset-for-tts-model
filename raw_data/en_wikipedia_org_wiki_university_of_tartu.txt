It is the national university of Estonia.

[ 5 ] It is also the largest and oldest university in the country.

[ 2 ] The university was founded under the name of Academia Gustaviana in 1632 by Baron Johan Skytte , the Governor-General of Swedish Livonia , Ingria , and Karelia , with the required ratification provided by King Gustavus Adolphus , shortly before the king's death on 6 November in the Battle of Lützen (1632) .

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] 15,206 students study at the university, of whom over 1,500 are foreigners (10%).

[ 3 ] Most of the curriculum is instructed in Estonian. However, there are still 30 English-taught programs: three at the undergraduate level and 27 at the master's level, including the Erasmus Mundus program in Excellence in Analytical Chemistry.

[ 8 ] The historical buildings of the university are included in the European Heritage Label list as "embodiment of the ideas of a university in the Age of Enlightenment ".

[ 9 ] The university is a member of the Coimbra Group and the Utrecht Network .

[ 10 ] The mascot of the university is a blue bird called Tiksu.

History [ edit ] Academia Gustaviana [ edit ] The university was originally founded as the Academia Gustaviana in the Swedish province of Livonia . It was the second university founded in the Swedish Empire , following Uppsala University (in Uppsala , Sweden proper) and preceding the Academy of Åbo (in Turku , Finland ). A precursor to the academy had been a Jesuit grammar school Gymnasium Dorpatense , founded by Stefan Batory (then king of Poland–Lithuania ) in 1583 and existing to 1601, when Tartu (Dorpat) was under Polish–Lithuanian rule.

The first students matriculated between 20 and 21 April 1632. The opening ceremony of Academia Dorpatensis (Academia Gustaviana) took place on 15 October in the same year. The academy in Tartu functioned with philosophy, law, theology, and medical faculties enjoying the privileges of the University of Uppsala. On account of the Russian–Swedish war , the University of Tartu moved to Tallinn in 1656, and in 1665, it closed down. In the 17th century, the future outstanding Swedish scholars Urban Hiärne , Olof Verelius , Arvid Moller [ sv ] , and others studied at the university. Among the academic staff were Friedrich Menius [ sv ] , professor of history (the history of Livonia , the first scientific approach to Estonian folklore) and Georg Mancelius , professor of theology (author of the first Latvian -German dictionary in 1638 [ 11 ] ).

Academia Gustavo-Carolina [ edit ] With the re-establishment of the university in 1690 as the Academia Gustavo-Carolina , Tartu became a university town again. Academic staff of the new university included Sven Dimberg [ sv ] , professor of mathematics (the first in the world to deliver lectures based on Newton's theory), Olof Hermelin [ sv ] , professor of rhetoric and poetry, Lars Micrander [ sv ] , professor of medicine (founder of balneology , and discoverer of natural mineral water springs) and Michael Dau , professor of philosophy as well as of rhetoric and poetry. Just under a decade after being reconstituted, as a result of the coalition against Sweden (Russia, Denmark-Norway , and Saxony-Poland-Lithuania) and the Great Famine of 1695–1697 , the university moved from Tartu to Pärnu . Eventually, Academia Gustavo-Carolina, which had opened in Pärnu on 28 August 1699, was closed as a result of the surrender of Pärnu to Russian forces on 12 August 1710 during the Great Northern War . According to the terms of the capitulation, the Russians agreed to maintain the university in Pärnu.

[ 12 ] However, the university was only reopened in 1802 by the Baltic German Ritterschaften , when the new German-speaking University was relaunched and had its new charter confirmed by the reform-minded Tsar Alexander I of Russia .

[ 13 ] Universität Dorpat [ edit ] Main article: Imperial University of Dorpat The university in 1860, during its 'Golden Age'.

Main building of the University of Tartu constructed between 1804 and 1809.

The Old Observatory of Tartu Observatory was completed in 1810.

Friedrich Georg Wilhelm von Struve worked here.

The Botanical Garden was founded by Gottfried Albrecht Germann in 1803.

The university was reopened by the Baltic Germans in Estonia in April 1802.

[ 14 ] The language of instruction at Dorpat was German [ 15 ] from 1802 to 1893. During that time, Dorpat had a dual nature in that it belonged both to the set of German(-language) and Russian universities. Financially and administratively, the latter was more important; intellectually and regarding the professoriate and students, the former was more important (over half the professors came from Germany , at least another third were Baltic Germans ). Among the 30 German-language universities, of which 23 were inside the German Empire , Dorpat was the 11th in size. In teaching, the university educated the local Baltic German leadership and professional classes, as well as staff, especially for the administration and health system of the entire Russian Empire . In scholarship, it was an international university; the time between 1860 and 1880 was its "golden age".

The freedom to be a half-German university ceased with the rise of nationalist tendencies in Russia, which held homogenization more important than retaining a bilingual university. Between 1882 and 1898, russification in language, appointments, etc., was imposed, with some exceptions (such as the Divinity School, which the state feared would be used by the Orthodox clergy to teach dangerous Protestant views and was thus allowed to continue in German until 1916). By 1898, when both the town and the university were renamed Yuryev , virtually all distinguished scholars from Germany had left. The University of Yuryev existed until 1918, when during part of the fall term, it was reopened, under German occupation , as Dorpat. Russian academic staff and students took refuge in Voronezh in Russia, giving rise to the foundation of Voronezh State University , which traces its own history back to the foundation of the University of Tartu and still holds several physical properties of the latter.

[ 16 ] [ 17 ] University of Tartu (1919–) [ edit ] Since Estonia became independent in 1918, the University of Tartu has been an Estonian-language institution since 1919. The university was named Ostland-Universität in Dorpat during the German occupation of Estonia in 1941–1944 and Tartu State University (Estonian: Tartu Riiklik Ülikool ) in 1940–1941 and 1944–1989, during the Soviet occupation . During Soviet rule, although Estonian remained the principal language of instruction, some courses were taught in Russian, with several Russian curricula. Estonia regained independence in 1991, and the full recovery of academic autonomy of the university can be dated to 1992 with the introduction of financial and academic strategic planning.

[ 18 ] Presently, no courses are taught in Russian.

[ 19 ] The first Estonian satellite ESTCube-1 was developed mainly by the students from the University of Tartu.

The last decade has been marked by organizational and structural changes, as well as adaptations to various university models (American, Scandinavian, German) against the background of the Soviet and Baltic German past. Most recently, the university has been and is still being marked by the adaptation of the Bologna declaration in Estonia generally and Tartu specifically, leading to major changes in curricula and studies, as well as by strong organizational centralization attempts. Recent plans also include the abolition of the Chair system (an Americanization) and of the faculties, which is supposed to lead to four large divisions (humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and medicine) under briefly serving deans and rector-appointed financial administrators.

Buildings [ edit ] Drone video of University of Tartu main building in December 2021 The university's four museums, botanical gardens, and sports facilities are, by and large, open to the general public. The university possesses 56 buildings, 11 of which are outside of Tartu; 31 of its buildings decorate the city as architectural monuments. In May 2023, the University of Tartu relaunched its virtual tour that has 360-degree photos of over 160 locations in the University campus.

At the same time, numerous university buildings and student dormitories have been recently constructed or renovated, such as the Von Bock House . Many of the new buildings are built at Maarjamõisa (about 2 km southwest of the historical university centre), such as the Technology Institute, the Biomedical Center, the Chemistry building, and the new Physics building.

Lectinology, the science of lectins , was founded at the University of Tartu in 1888 with the publication of Peter Hermann Stillmark 's thesis about the isolation of ricin .

According to the university administration, the most remarkable recent research achievements have been in the fields of molecular and cell biology , laser medicine , materials science , laser spectroscopy , biochemistry , and psychology .

UT is the flagship of Estonian science, ranking in the top 1% of the world's most-cited universities and research institutions in these fields (as of March 2025): Biology and biochemistry Chemistry Clinical medicine Engineering Environment/ecology Immunology Geosciences Materials science Microbiology Molecular biology and genetics Neuroscience and behavior Pharmacology and toxicology Plant and animal science Psychiatry and psychology Social sciences, general.

[ 20 ] UT accounts for 56% of Estonia's national research output. Also, more than half of the PhD theses in Estonia are defended at UT and over 2,000 high-level research articles (those covered by citation indices like "SCI Expanded", "SSCI", or "A&HCI") are published annually. About 50 UT scientists are among the top 1% of the most-cited scientists in the world.

UT has excelled among the Baltic universities in winning European Research Council grants. The prestigious ERC grant has been awarded to Professor of Molecular Systems Biology Mart Loog, Professor of Nanomedicine Tambet Teesalu, and Professor of International Law Lauri Mälksoo.
