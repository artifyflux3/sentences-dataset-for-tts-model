The **metre** (or **meter** in [US spelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_and_British_English_spelling_differences#-re,_-er "American and British English spelling differences"); symbol: **m**) is the [base unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI_base_unit "SI base unit") of [length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length "Length") in the [International System of Units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units "International System of Units") (SI). Since 2019, the metre has been defined as the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of ⁠1/299 792 458⁠ of a [second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second "Second"), where the second is defined by a [hyperfine transition frequency of caesium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesium_standard "Caesium standard").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre#cite_note-SIBrochure9thEd-2)

The metre was originally defined in 1791 by the [French National Assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Constituent_Assembly_(France) "National Constituent Assembly (France)") as one ten-millionth of the distance from the [equator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equator "Equator") to the [North Pole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Pole "North Pole") along a [great circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_circle "Great circle"), so the [Earth's polar circumference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_circumference "Earth's circumference") is approximately 40 000 km.

In 1799, the metre was redefined in terms of a prototype metre bar. The bar used was changed in 1889, and in 1960 the metre was redefined in terms of a certain number of wavelengths of a certain emission line of [krypton-86](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krypton-86 "Krypton-86"). The current definition was adopted in 1983 and modified slightly in 2002 to clarify that the metre is a measure of [proper length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_length "Proper length"). From 1983 until 2019, the metre was formally defined as the length of the path travelled by [light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light "Light") in vacuum in ⁠1/299 792 458⁠ of a [second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second "Second"). After the [2019 revision of the SI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_revision_of_the_SI "2019 revision of the SI"), this definition was rephrased to include the definition of a second in terms of the caesium frequency Δ _ν_ Cs. This series of amendments did not alter the size of the metre significantly – today Earth's polar circumference measures 40 007.863 km, a change of about 200 [parts per million](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parts_per_million "Parts per million") from the original value of exactly 40 000 km, which also includes improvements in the accuracy of measuring the circumference.

_Metre_ is the standard spelling of the metric unit for length in nearly all English-speaking nations, the exceptions being the United States[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre#cite_note-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre#cite_note-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre#cite_note-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre#cite_note-6) and the Philippines[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre#cite_note-7) which use _meter_.

Measuring devices (such as [ammeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammeter "Ammeter"), [speedometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedometer "Speedometer")) are spelled "-meter" in all variants of English.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre#cite_note-8) The suffix "-meter" has the same Greek origin as the unit of length.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre#cite_note-9)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre#cite_note-10)

The etymological roots of _metre_ can be traced to the Greek verb μετρέω (_metreo_) ((I) measure, count or compare)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre#cite_note-11) and noun μέτρον (_metron_) (a measure),[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre#cite_note-12) which were used for physical measurement, for poetic metre and by extension for moderation or avoiding extremism (as in "be measured in your response"). This range of uses is also found in Latin (_metior, mensura_), French (_mètre, mesure_), English and other languages. The Greek word is derived from the Proto-Indo-European root _[*meh₁-](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/*meh%E2%82%81- "wikt:*meh₁-")_ 'to measure'. The motto ΜΕΤΡΩ ΧΡΩ (_metro chro_) in the seal of the [International Bureau of Weights and Measures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Bureau_of_Weights_and_Measures "International Bureau of Weights and Measures") (BIPM), was approved by [Adolphe Hirsch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolphe_Hirsch "Adolphe Hirsch") on 11 July 1875 and may be translated as "Keep the measure", thus calls for both measurement and moderation.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre#cite_note-:6-13) The use of the word _metre_ (for the French unit _mètre_) in English began at least as early as 1797.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre#cite_note-Oxford-14)

History of definition
---------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Metre&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: History of definition")]

During the [French Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution "French Revolution"), the [traditional units of measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement_in_France_before_the_French_Revolution "Units of measurement in France before the French Revolution") were to be replaced by consistent measures based on natural phenomena. As a base [unit of length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_of_length "Unit of length"), scientists had favoured the [seconds pendulum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seconds_pendulum "Seconds pendulum") (a pendulum with a half-period of one second) one century earlier, but this was rejected as it had been discovered that this length varied from place to place with local gravity. The _mètre_ was introduced – defined as one ten-millionth of the shortest distance from the North Pole to the equator [passing through Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_meridian "Paris meridian"), assuming an [Earth flattening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_flattening "Earth flattening") of ⁠1/334⁠.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre#cite_note-History_of_the_metre_Quinn-2012-15)

Following the [arc measurement of Delambre and Méchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc_measurement_of_Delambre_and_M%C3%A9chain "Arc measurement of Delambre and Méchain"), the historical French official standard of the metre was made available in the form of the _[Mètre des Archives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A8tre\_des\_Archives "Mètre des Archives")_, a platinum bar held in Paris. It was originally also planned to dematerialize the definition of the metre by counting the number of swings of a one-metre-long pendulum during a day at a [latitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude "Latitude") of 45°.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre#cite_note-History_of_the_metre_:1-16) However, dematerializing the definition of units of length by means of the pendulum would prove less reliable than artefacts.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre#cite_note-History_of_the_metre_Crease-2009-17)[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre#cite_note-History_of_the_metre_:3-18)

During the mid nineteenth century, following the [American Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolution "American Revolution") and [independence of Latin America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decolonization_of_the_Americas "Decolonization of the Americas"), the metre gained adoption in [Americas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas "Americas"), particularly in scientific usage, and it was officially established as an international measurement unit by the [Metre Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre_Convention "Metre Convention") of 1875 at the beginning of the [Second Industrial Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Industrial_Revolution "Second Industrial Revolution").

The _[Mètre des Archives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A8tre\_des\_Archives "Mètre des Archives")_ and its copies such as the [Committee Meter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_Meter "Committee Meter") were replaced from 1889 at the initiative of the [International Geodetic Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Association_of_Geodesy "International Association of Geodesy") by thirty [platinum-iridium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platinum-iridium "Platinum-iridium") bars kept across the globe.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre#cite_note-19) A better [standardisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardisation "Standardisation") of the new prototypes of the metre and their comparison with each other and with the historical standard involved the development of specialised measuring equipment and the definition of a reproducible temperature scale.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre#cite_note-History_of_the_metre_la_d%C3%A9finition_du_m%C3%A8tre-20)

In collaboration with the [International Geodetic Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Association_of_Geodesy "International Association of Geodesy") created to measure the Earth, the [International Bureau of Weights and Measures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Bureau_of_Weights_and_Measures "International Bureau of Weights and Measures") became the world reference center for the measurement of geodetic bases thanks to the discovery of [invar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invar "Invar"), an alloy of nickel and iron with a coefficient of [thermal expansion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_expansion "Thermal expansion") close to zero.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre#cite_note-History_of_the_metre_BIPM-150-21)[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre#cite_note-History_of_the_metre_:0-22)

Progress in science finally allowed the definition of the metre to be dematerialised; thus in 1960 a new definition based on a specific number of wavelengths of light from a specific transition in [krypton-86](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krypton-86 "Krypton-86") allowed the standard to be universally available by measurement. In 1983 this was updated to a length defined in terms of the [speed of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light "Speed of light"); this definition was reworded in 2019:[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre#cite_note-History_of_the_metre_2019metre-23)

> The metre, symbol m, is the SI unit of length. It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the [speed of light in vacuum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light_in_vacuum "Speed of light in vacuum")c to be 299 792 458 when expressed in the unit m⋅s−1, where the second is defined in terms of the caesium frequency Δ _ν_ Cs.

Where older traditional length measures are still used, they are now defined in terms of the metre – for example the [yard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yard "Yard") has since 1959 officially been defined as exactly 0.9144 metre.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre#cite_note-History_of_the_metre_Nelson-24)

SI prefixed forms of metre
--------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Metre&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: SI prefixed forms of metre")]

[SI prefixes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI_prefix "SI prefix") can be used to denote decimal multiples and submultiples of the metre, as shown in the table below. Long distances are usually expressed in km, [astronomical units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit "Astronomical unit") (149.6 Gm), [light-years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-year "Light-year") (10 Pm), or [parsecs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec "Parsec") (31 Pm), rather than in Mm or larger multiples; "30 cm", "30 m", and "300 m" are more common than "3 dm", "3 dam", and "3 hm", respectively.

The terms _[micron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micron "Micron")_ and _[millimicron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimicron "Millimicron")_ have been used instead of _micrometre_ (μm) and _nanometre_ (nm), respectively, but this practice is discouraged.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre#cite_note-25)

| --- | --- |
| 1 metre | ≈ | 1.0936 | [yard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yard "Yard") |  | 1 yard | = | 0.9144 | metre |
| 1 metre | ≈ | 39.370 | [inches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inch "Inch") |  | 1 inch | = | 0.0254 | metre |

Within this table, "inch" and "yard" mean "international inch" and "international yard"[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre#cite_note-26) respectively, though approximate conversions in the left column hold for both international and survey units.

"≈" means "is approximately equal to";"=" means "is exactly equal to".
One metre is exactly equivalent to ⁠5 000/127⁠inches and to ⁠1 250/1 143⁠yards.

A simple [mnemonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic "Mnemonic") to assist with conversion is "three 3s": 1 metre is nearly equivalent to 3[feet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot_(unit) "Foot (unit)")3+3⁄8 inches. This gives an overestimate of 0.125 mm.

The ancient Egyptian [cubit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubit "Cubit") was about 0.5 m (surviving rods are 523–529 mm).[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre#cite_note-27) Scottish and English definitions of the [ell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ell "Ell") (2 cubits) were 941 mm (0.941 m) and 1143 mm (1.143 m) respectively.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre#cite_note-28)[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre#cite_note-29) The ancient Parisian _toise_ (fathom) was slightly shorter than 2 m and was standardised at exactly 2 m in the [mesures usuelles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesures_usuelles "Mesures usuelles") system, such that 1 m was exactly 1⁄2 toise.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre#cite_note-H&H-30) The Russian [verst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verst "Verst") was 1.0668 km.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre#cite_note-FOOTNOTECardarelli2004-31) The [Swedish mil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandinavian_mile "Scandinavian mile") was 10.688 km, but was changed to 10 km when Sweden converted to metric units.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre#cite_note-32)

However, in 2008 the U.S. English translation published by the U.S. [National Institute of Standards and Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology "National Institute of Standards and Technology") (NIST) chose to use the spelling _meter_ in accordance with the United States Government Printing Office Style Manual. The Metric Conversion Act of 1975 gives the Secretary of Commerce of the US the responsibility of interpreting or modifying the SI for use in the US. The Secretary of Commerce delegated this authority to the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology ([Turner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre#turner)). In 2008, NIST published the US version ([Taylor and Thompson, 2008a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre#taylor2008a)) of the English text of the eighth edition of the BIPM publication _\_Le Système international d'unités\_ (SI)_ (BIPM, 2006).

Thus, the spelling _metre_ is referred to as the "international spelling"; the spelling _meter_, as the "American spelling".
