SI units 1000 mm 0.001 km Imperial / US units ≈ 1.0936 yd ≈ 3.2808 ft ≈ 39.37 in Nautical units ≈ 0.000 539 96 nmi The metre (or meter in US spelling ; symbol: m ) is the base unit of length in the International System of Units (SI). Since 2019, the metre has been defined as the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of ⁠ 1 / 299 792 458 ⁠ of a second , where the second is defined by a hyperfine transition frequency of caesium .

[ 2 ] The metre was originally defined in 1791 by the French National Assembly as one ten-millionth of the distance from the equator to the North Pole along a great circle , so the Earth's polar circumference is approximately 40 000 km .

In 1799, the metre was redefined in terms of a prototype metre bar. The bar used was changed in 1889, and in 1960 the metre was redefined in terms of a certain number of wavelengths of a certain emission line of krypton-86 . The current definition was adopted in 1983 and modified slightly in 2002 to clarify that the metre is a measure of proper length . From 1983 until 2019, the metre was formally defined as the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum in ⁠ 1 / 299 792 458 ⁠ of a second . After the 2019 revision of the SI , this definition was rephrased to include the definition of a second in terms of the caesium frequency Δ ν Cs . This series of amendments did not alter the size of the metre significantly – today Earth's polar circumference measures 40 007 .863 km , a change of about 200 parts per million from the original value of exactly 40 000 km , which also includes improvements in the accuracy of measuring the circumference.

Spelling [ edit ] Metre is the standard spelling of the metric unit for length in nearly all English-speaking nations, the exceptions being the United States [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] and the Philippines [ 7 ] which use meter .

Measuring devices (such as ammeter , speedometer ) are spelled "-meter" in all variants of English.

[ 8 ] The suffix "-meter" has the same Greek origin as the unit of length.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] Etymology [ edit ] The etymological roots of metre can be traced to the Greek verb μετρέω ( metreo ) ((I) measure, count or compare) [ 11 ] and noun μέτρον ( metron ) (a measure), [ 12 ] which were used for physical measurement, for poetic metre and by extension for moderation or avoiding extremism (as in "be measured in your response"). This range of uses is also found in Latin ( metior, mensura ), French ( mètre, mesure ), English and other languages. The Greek word is derived from the Proto-Indo-European root *meh₁- 'to measure'. The motto ΜΕΤΡΩ ΧΡΩ ( metro chro ) in the seal of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM), was approved by Adolphe Hirsch on 11 July 1875 and may be translated as "Keep the measure", thus calls for both measurement and moderation.

[ 13 ] The use of the word metre (for the French unit mètre ) in English began at least as early as 1797.

[ 14 ] History of definition [ edit ] This section is an excerpt from History of the metre .

[ edit ] During the French Revolution , the traditional units of measure were to be replaced by consistent measures based on natural phenomena. As a base unit of length , scientists had favoured the seconds pendulum (a pendulum with a half-period of one second) one century earlier, but this was rejected as it had been discovered that this length varied from place to place with local gravity. The mètre was introduced – defined as one ten-millionth of the shortest distance from the North Pole to the equator passing through Paris , assuming an Earth flattening of ⁠ 1 / 334 ⁠ .

[ 15 ] Following the arc measurement of Delambre and Méchain , the historical French official standard of the metre was made available in the form of the Mètre des Archives , a platinum bar held in Paris. It was originally also planned to dematerialize the definition of the metre by counting the number of swings of a one-metre-long pendulum during a day at a latitude of 45°.

[ 16 ] However, dematerializing the definition of units of length by means of the pendulum would prove less reliable than artefacts.

[ 17 ] [ 18 ] During the mid nineteenth century, following the American Revolution and independence of Latin America , the metre gained adoption in Americas , particularly in scientific usage, and it was officially established as an international measurement unit by the Metre Convention of 1875 at the beginning of the Second Industrial Revolution .

The Mètre des Archives and its copies such as the Committee Meter were replaced from 1889 at the initiative of the International Geodetic Association by thirty platinum-iridium bars kept across the globe.

[ 19 ] A better standardisation of the new prototypes of the metre  and their comparison with each other and with the historical standard involved the development of specialised measuring equipment and the definition of a reproducible temperature scale.

[ 20 ] In collaboration with the International Geodetic Association created to measure the Earth, the International Bureau of Weights and Measures became the world reference center for the measurement of geodetic bases thanks to the discovery of invar , an alloy of nickel and iron with a coefficient of thermal expansion close to zero.

[ 21 ] [ 22 ] Progress in science finally allowed the definition of the metre to be dematerialised; thus in 1960 a new definition based on a specific number of wavelengths of light from a specific transition in krypton-86 allowed the standard to be universally available by measurement. In 1983 this was updated to a length defined in terms of the speed of light ; this definition was reworded in 2019: [ 23 ] The metre, symbol m, is the SI unit of length. It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the speed of light in vacuum c to be 299 792 458 when expressed in the unit m⋅s −1 , where the second is defined in terms of the caesium frequency Δ ν Cs .

Where older traditional length measures are still used, they are now defined in terms of the metre – for example the yard has since 1959 officially been defined as exactly 0.9144 metre.

[ 24 ] SI prefixed forms of metre [ edit ] Main article: Orders of magnitude (length) SI prefixes can be used to denote decimal multiples and submultiples of the metre, as shown in the table below. Long distances are usually expressed in km, astronomical units (149.6 Gm), light-years (10 Pm), or parsecs (31 Pm), rather than in Mm or larger multiples; "30 cm", "30 m", and "300 m" are more common than "3 dm", "3 dam", and "3 hm", respectively.

The terms micron and millimicron have been used instead of micrometre (μm) and nanometre (nm), respectively, but this practice is discouraged.

[ 25 ] SI multiples of metre (m) Submultiples Multiples Value SI symbol Name Value SI symbol Name 10 −1 m dm decimetre 10 1 m dam decametre 10 −2 m cm centimetre 10 2 m hm hectometre 10 −3 m mm millimetre 10 3 m km kilometre 10 −6 m μm micrometre 10 6 m Mm megametre 10 −9 m nm nanometre 10 9 m Gm gigametre 10 −12 m pm picometre 10 12 m Tm terametre 10 −15 m fm femtometre 10 15 m Pm petametre 10 −18 m am attometre 10 18 m Em exametre 10 −21 m zm zeptometre 10 21 m Zm zettametre 10 −24 m ym yoctometre 10 24 m Ym yottametre 10 −27 m rm rontometre 10 27 m Rm ronnametre 10 −30 m qm quectometre 10 30 m Qm quettametre Equivalents in other units [ edit ] Metric unit expressed in non-SI units Non-SI unit expressed in metric units 1 metre ≈ 1.0936 yard 1 yard = 0.9144 metre 1 metre ≈ 39.370 inches 1 inch = 0.0254 metre 1 centimetre ≈ 0.393 70 inch 1 inch = 2.54 centimetres 1 millimetre ≈ 0.039 370 inch 1 inch = 25.4 millimetres 1 metre = 10 10 ångström 1 ångström = 10 −10 metre 1 nanometre = 10 ångström 1 ångström = 100 picometres Within this table, "inch" and "yard" mean "international inch" and "international yard" [ 26 ] respectively, though approximate conversions in the left column hold for both international and survey units.

"≈" means "is approximately equal to"; "=" means "is exactly equal to".

One metre is exactly equivalent to ⁠ 5 000 / 127 ⁠ inches and to ⁠ 1 250 / 1 143 ⁠ yards.

A simple mnemonic to assist with conversion is "three 3s": 1 metre is nearly equivalent to 3 feet 3 + 3 ⁄ 8 inches. This gives an overestimate of 0.125 mm.

The ancient Egyptian cubit was about 0.5 m (surviving rods are 523–529 mm).

[ 27 ] Scottish and English definitions of the ell (2 cubits) were 941 mm (0.941 m) and 1143 mm (1.143 m) respectively.

[ 28 ] [ 29 ] The ancient Parisian toise (fathom) was slightly shorter than 2 m and was standardised at exactly 2 m in the mesures usuelles system, such that 1 m was exactly 1 ⁄ 2 toise.

[ 30 ] The Russian verst was 1.0668 km.

[ 31 ] The Swedish mil was 10.688 km, but was changed to 10 km when Sweden converted to metric units.

The spelling of English words is in accordance with the United States Government Printing Office Style Manual, which follows Webster's Third New International Dictionary rather than the Oxford Dictionary. Thus the spellings 'meter', 'liter', 'deka', and 'cesium' are used rather than 'metre', 'litre', 'deca', and 'caesium' as in the original BIPM English text.

^ The most recent official brochure about the International System of Units (SI), written in French by the Bureau international des poids et mesures , International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) uses the spelling metre ; an English translation, included to make the SI standard more widely accessible also uses the spelling metre ( BIPM, 2006 , p. 130 ff ). However, in 2008 the U.S. English translation published by the U.S.

National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) chose to use the spelling meter in accordance with the United States Government Printing Office Style Manual. The Metric Conversion Act of 1975 gives the Secretary of Commerce of the US the responsibility of interpreting or modifying the SI for use in the US. The Secretary of Commerce delegated this authority to the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology ( Turner ). In 2008, NIST published the US version ( Taylor and Thompson, 2008a ) of the English text of the eighth edition of the BIPM publication Le Système international d'unités (SI) (BIPM, 2006). In the NIST publication, the spellings "meter", "liter" and "deka" are used rather than "metre", "litre" and "deca" as in the original BIPM English text ( Taylor and Thompson (2008a), p. iii ). The Director of the NIST officially recognised this publication, together with Taylor and Thompson (2008b) , as the "legal interpretation" of the SI for the United States ( Turner ). Thus, the spelling metre is referred to as the "international spelling"; the spelling meter , as the "American spelling".

^ The Philippines uses English as an official language and this largely follows American English since the country became a colony of the United States. While the law that converted the country to use the metric system uses metre ( Batas Pambansa Blg. 8 ) following the SI spelling, in actual practice, meter is used in government and everyday commerce, as evidenced by laws ( kilometer , Republic Act No. 7160 ), Supreme Court decisions ( meter , G.R. No. 185240 ), and national standards ( centimeter , PNS/BAFS 181:2016 ).
