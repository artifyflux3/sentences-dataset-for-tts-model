They therefore have approximately the same orbital period as Neptune and follow roughly the same orbital path. Thirty-one Neptune trojans are currently known, of which 27 orbit near the Sun–Neptune L 4 Lagrangian point 60° ahead of Neptune [ 1 ] and four orbit near Neptune's L 5 region 60° behind Neptune.

[ 1 ] The Neptune trojans are termed 'trojans' by analogy with the Jupiter trojans .

The discovery of 2005 TN 53 in a high-inclination (>25°) orbit was significant, because it suggested a "thick" cloud of trojans [ 2 ] ( Jupiter trojans have inclinations up to 40° [ 3 ] ), which is indicative of freeze-in capture instead of in situ or collisional formation.

[ 2 ] It is suspected that large (radius ≈ 100 km) Neptune trojans could outnumber Jupiter trojans by an order of magnitude .

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] In 2010, the discovery of the first known L 5 Neptune trojan, 2008 LC 18 , was announced.

[ 6 ] Neptune's trailing L 5 region is currently very difficult to observe because it is along the line of sight to the center of the Milky Way , an area of the sky crowded with stars.

Discovery and exploration [ edit ] In 2001, the first Neptune trojan was discovered, (612243) 2001 QR 322 , near Neptune's L 4 region, and with it the fifth [ a ] known populated stable reservoir of small bodies in the Solar System. In 2005, the discovery of the high-inclination trojan 2005 TN 53 has indicated that the Neptune trojans populate thick clouds, which has constrained their possible origins (see below).

On August 12, 2010, the first L 5 trojan, 2008 LC 18 , was announced.

[ 6 ] It was discovered by a dedicated survey that scanned regions where the light from the stars near the Galactic Center is obscured by dust clouds.

[ 7 ] This suggests that large L 5 trojans are as common as large L 4 trojans, to within uncertainty, [ 7 ] further constraining models about their origins (see below).

It would have been possible for the New Horizons spacecraft to investigate L 5 Neptune trojans discovered by 2014, when it passed through this region of space en route to Pluto .

[ 5 ] Some of the patches where the light from the Galactic Center is obscured by dust clouds are along New Horizons ' s flight path, allowing detection of objects that the spacecraft could image.

[ 7 ] 2011 HM 102 , the highest-inclination Neptune trojan known, was just bright enough for New Horizons to observe it in end-2013 at a distance of 1.2 AU.

[ 8 ] However, New Horizons may not have had sufficient downlink bandwidth, so it was eventually decided to give precedence to the preparations for the Pluto flyby.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] Dynamics and origin [ edit ] An animation showing the path of six of Neptune's L 4 trojans in a rotating frame with a period equal to Neptune 's orbital period. Neptune is held stationary. (Click to view.) The orbits of Neptune trojans are highly stable; Neptune may have retained up to 50% of the original post-migration trojan population over the age of the Solar System.

[ 2 ] Neptune's L 5 can host stable trojans equally well as its L 4 .

[ 11 ] Neptune trojans can librate up to 30° from their associated Lagrangian points with a 10,000-year period.

[ 7 ] Neptune trojans that escape enter orbits similar to centaurs .

[ 11 ] Although Neptune cannot currently capture stable trojans, [ 2 ] roughly 2.8% of the centaurs within 34 AU are predicted to be Neptune co-orbitals . Of these, 54% would be in horseshoe orbits , 10% would be quasi-satellites , and 36% would be trojans (evenly split between the L 4 and L 5 groups).

[ 12 ] The unexpected high-inclination trojans are the key to understanding the origin and evolution of the population as a whole.

[ 11 ] The existence of high-inclination Neptune trojans points to a capture during planetary migration instead of in situ or collisional formation.

[ 2 ] [ 7 ] The estimated equal number of large L 5 and L 4 trojans indicates that there was no gas drag during capture and points to a common capture mechanism for both L 4 and L 5 trojans.

[ 7 ] The capture of Neptune trojans during a migration of the planets occurs via process similar to the chaotic capture of Jupiter trojans in the Nice model. When Uranus and Neptune are near but not in a mean-motion resonance the locations where Uranus passes Neptune can circulate with a period that is in resonance with the libration periods of Neptune trojans. This results in repeated perturbations that increase the libration of existing trojans causing their orbits to become unstable.

[ 13 ] This process is reversible allowing new trojans to be captured when the planetary migration continues.

[ 14 ] For high-inclination trojans to be captured the migration must have been slow, [ 15 ] or their inclinations must have been acquired previously.

[ 16 ] Colors [ edit ] The first four discovered Neptune trojans have similar colors.

[ 2 ] They are modestly red, slightly redder than the gray Kuiper belt objects, but not as extremely red as the high-perihelion cold classical Kuiper belt objects .

[ 2 ] This is similar to the colors of the blue lobe of the centaur color distribution, the Jupiter trojans , the irregular satellites of the gas giants, and possibly the comets , which is consistent with a similar origin of these populations of small Solar System bodies .

[ 2 ] The Neptune trojans are too faint to efficiently observe spectroscopically with current technology, which means that a large variety of surface compositions are compatible with the observed colors.

[ 2 ] Several Neptunian Trojans have been observed to have very-red colors similar to cold classical Kuiper belt objects .

[ 17 ] Naming [ edit ] In 2015, the IAU adopted a new naming scheme for Neptune trojans, which are to be named after Amazons , with no differentiation between objects in L4 and L5.

[ 18 ] The Amazons were an all-female warrior tribe that fought in the Trojan War on the side of the Trojans against the Greeks. As of 2019, the named Neptune trojans are 385571 Otrera (after Otrera , the first Amazonian queen in Greek mythology ) and 385695 Clete (after Clete , an Amazon and the attendant to the Amazons' queen Penthesilea , who led the Amazons in the Trojan war).

[ 19 ] [ 20 ] Members [ edit ] The amount of high-inclination objects in such a small sample, in which relatively fewer high-inclination Neptune trojans are known due to observational biases, [ 2 ] implies that high-inclination trojans may significantly outnumber low-inclination trojans.

[ 11 ] The ratio of high- to low-inclination Neptune trojans is estimated to be about 4:1.

[ 2 ] Assuming albedos of 0.05, there are an expected 400 +250 −200 Neptune trojans with radii above 40 km in Neptune's L 4 .

[ 2 ] This would indicate that large Neptune trojans are 5 to 20 times more abundant than Jupiter trojans , depending on their albedos.

[ 2 ] There may be relatively fewer smaller Neptune trojans, which could be because these fragment more readily.

[ 2 ] Large L 5 trojans are estimated to be as common as large L 4 trojans.

[ 7 ] (612243) 2001 QR 322 and 2008 LC 18 display significant dynamical instability.

[ 11 ] This means they could have been captured after planetary migration, but may as well be a long-term member that happens not to be perfectly dynamically stable.

[ 11 ] As of September 2023, 31 Neptune trojans are known, of which 27 orbit near the Sun – Neptune L 4 Lagrangian point 60° ahead of Neptune, [ 1 ] 4 orbit near Neptune's L 5 region 60° behind Neptune, and one orbits on the opposite side of Neptune ( L 3 ) but frequently changes location relative to Neptune to L4 and L5.

[ 1 ] These are listed in the following table. It is constructed from the list of Neptune trojans maintained by the IAU Minor Planet Center [ 1 ] and with diameters from Sheppard and Trujillo's paper on 2008 LC 18 , [ 7 ] unless otherwise noted.
