[ 1 ] [ 2 ] The park includes trails and huts.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] The mountains, forests, tussock lands and river valleys are used for tramping, fishing kayaking, horse riding and hunting.

[ 6 ] Both the park and neighbouring Ben Avon Station are located near the Aoraki Mackenzie International Dark Sky Reserve, a dark-sky preserve , and are used for astronomy.

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] History [ edit ] The park was established in 2005, and includes the Birchwood Station leasehold farm the New Zealand Government bought back for NZ$10 million in 2004. It contained extensive wetlands that had remained largely undeveloped.

[ 10 ] Birchwood Station continued normal farming operations until the end of the leasehold in 2010.

[ 11 ] The road to the former Birchwood Station homestead stopped being regularly maintained by Waitaki District Council in 2011.

[ 12 ] In 2014, ecologist Peter Espie reported a decrease in native plant species in the park, and suggested introducing grazing management.

[ 13 ] Parts of the 2020 Disney film Mulan were filmed in the Ahuriri Valley near the conservation park, including the training camp scenes and some battle scenes.
