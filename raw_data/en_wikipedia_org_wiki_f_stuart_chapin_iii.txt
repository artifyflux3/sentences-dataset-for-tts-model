( October 2021 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) F. Stuart Chapin III (or Terry Chapin ) (born February 2, 1944) is a professor of Ecology at the Department of Biology and Wildlife of the Institute of Arctic Biology, University of Alaska . He was President of the Ecological Society of America (ESA) from August 2010 until 2011.

[ 1 ] The grandson of sociologist F. Stuart Chapin , Chapin III is better known to students and colleagues as 'Terry'. Chapin also serves as principal investigator of the Bonanza Creek Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) program, and has a background in plant physiological ecology and ecosystem ecology . His current research interests focus on the resilience of social-ecological systems. As director of the graduate educational program in Resilience and Adaptation at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, Chapin studies human-fire interactions in the boreal forest . As President of ESA, he plans to address the "critical issue" of planetary stewardship.

[ 2 ] With Mary Power and Steward Pickett, Chapin is leading a Planetary Stewardship initiative "whose goal is to reorient society toward a more sustainable relationship with the biosphere ." [ 3 ] In 2019 Terry Chapin won the Volvo Environment Prize .

[ 4 ] The jury citation states: "Professor Terry Chapin is not only a world-leading ecologist, he is also one of the world's most profound thinkers and actors on stewardship of the Earth System. [...] His work will have a long-lasting impact on the ways we seek to build a sustainable future , with the concept of Earth Stewardship supporting the deep institutional and structural change required to meet the challenges ahead."
