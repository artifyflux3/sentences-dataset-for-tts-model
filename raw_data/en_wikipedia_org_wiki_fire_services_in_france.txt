The fire service in France is organised into local fire services which mostly cover the Departments of France , with a few exceptions. There are two types of fire service: The Paris Fire Brigade ( Army ) and Marseille Naval Fire Battalion ( Navy ) are military units providing fire protection to Paris and Marseille.

The rest of France has civilian fire services organized, supervised and trained by the French Ministry of the Interior ; specifically, they fall under the Civil Defence and Security Directorate ( Direction Générale de la Sécurité Civile et de la Gestion de Crise , DGSCGC).

There are approximately 246,900 fire service personnel in France operating 15,642 emergency vehicles out of 6,894 emergency centres.

[ 1 ] In addition to providing fire protection and rescue, the French fire service is also one of the providers of emergency medical services .

[ 2 ] In French, firefighters are known as sapeurs-pompiers or informally as pompiers . The former originally refers to the military-based Paris Fire Brigade.

Pompier (pumper) comes from the word for pump (pompe), referring to the manual pumps originally used for firefighting.

Sapeur means sapper and refers to the first official firefighting unit created by Napoleon I , which was part of the military engineering arm. Firefighters in the Marseille Marine Fire Battalion are known as marins-pompiers (sailor-firefighters). The usual name of a civilian fire services is a service départemental d'incendie et de secours (SDIS) (Departmental Fire and Rescue Service). Young French citizens can fulfill the mandatory service Service national universel (SNU) in one of the fire brigades.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] Organization [ edit ] Central administration [ edit ] The Directorate General for Civil Defence and Crisis Management (DGSCGC) is the central administrative structure responsible for risk management in France, whether it concerns everyday accidents or major disasters. It includes several directorates: [ 5 ] Fire brigade directorate (DSP); Sub-directorate for crisis preparation, anticipation and management (SDPAGC); Sub-directorate for national resources (SDMN); Sub-directorate for international affairs, resources and strategy (SDAIRS).

The DGSCGC has at its disposal a civil defence headquarters (EMSC) and the general inspectorate for civil defence (IGSC). It employs approximately 3,000 civilian and military personnel spread over 60 sites.

Local fire services [ edit ] The fire service is organized based on the various departments . Each department has a Service Departmentaux d'Incendie et de Secours (SDIS, Departmental Fire and Rescue Service) responsible for operations within its territory, with a few exceptions: Paris and the three departments of the petite couronne ( Hauts-de-Seine , Seine-Saint-Denis and Val-de-Marne ) are covered by the Paris Fire Brigade .

Bouches-du-Rhône is covered by both the Marseille Naval Fire Battalion and a civilian Bouches-du-Rhône SDIS.

Lyon Metropolis and Rhône are both covered by the Rhône SDIS, reflecting Rhône's boundaries before 2015.

Corsica is divided between two fire services, reflecting the departments that existed from 1975 to 2017.

Fire service based Emergency Medical Services [ edit ] Ambulance (officially a VSAV) of the French fire service in Strasbourg , France Local fire departments also respond to medical calls and can send an ambulance , a multi-purpose response vehicle or even a fire apparatus .

[ 6 ] Here the cross-trained firefighters will provide care at the scene and transport for injuries or illness but are usually backed up by a SMUR unit for more serious or complex cases. Firefighters are trained to provide basic life support (BLS) care.

Although they also transport casualties and are, in any practical sense, ambulances, their vehicles are instead called a VSAV ( véhicule de secours et d'assistance aux victimes – rescue and casualty assistance vehicle).

[ 7 ] Volunteer-staffed ambulances may be called VPS ( véhicules de premiers secours – first aid vehicle). The VSAV and VPS are considered to be means of bringing rescue workers and equipment to the scene, with the evacuation of patients being the logical result of the response but not the primary duty of these response resources.
