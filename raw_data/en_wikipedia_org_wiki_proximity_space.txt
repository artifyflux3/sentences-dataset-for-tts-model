The concept was described by Frigyes Riesz ( 1909 ) but ignored at the time.

[ 1 ] It was rediscovered and axiomatized by V. A. Efremovič in 1934 under the name of infinitesimal space , but not published until 1951. In the interim, A. D. Wallace ( 1941 ) discovered a version of the same concept under the name of separation space .

Definition [ edit ] A proximity space ( X , δ δ ) {\displaystyle (X,\delta )} is a set X {\displaystyle X} with a relation δ δ {\displaystyle \delta } between subsets of X {\displaystyle X} satisfying the following properties: For all subsets A , B , C ⊆ ⊆ X {\displaystyle A,B,C\subseteq X} A δ δ B {\displaystyle A\;\delta \;B} implies B δ δ A {\displaystyle B\;\delta \;A} A δ δ B {\displaystyle A\;\delta \;B} implies A ≠ ≠ ∅ ∅ {\displaystyle A\neq \varnothing } A ∩ ∩ B ≠ ≠ ∅ ∅ {\displaystyle A\cap B\neq \varnothing } implies A δ δ B {\displaystyle A\;\delta \;B} A δ δ ( B ∪ ∪ C ) {\displaystyle A\;\delta \;(B\cup C)} if and only if ( A δ δ B {\displaystyle A\;\delta \;B} or A δ δ C {\displaystyle A\;\delta \;C} ) (For all E , {\displaystyle E,} A δ δ E {\displaystyle A\;\delta \;E} or B δ δ ( X ∖ ∖ E ) {\displaystyle B\;\delta \;(X\setminus E)} ) implies A δ δ B {\displaystyle A\;\delta \;B} Proximity without the first axiom is called quasi-proximity (but then Axioms 2 and 4 must be stated in a two-sided fashion).

If A δ δ B {\displaystyle A\;\delta \;B} we say A {\displaystyle A} is near B {\displaystyle B} or A {\displaystyle A} and B {\displaystyle B} are proximal ; otherwise we say A {\displaystyle A} and B {\displaystyle B} are apart . We say B {\displaystyle B} is a proximal- or δ δ {\displaystyle \delta } -neighborhood of A , {\displaystyle A,} written A ≪ ≪ B , {\displaystyle A\ll B,} if and only if A {\displaystyle A} and X ∖ ∖ B {\displaystyle X\setminus B} are apart.

The main properties of this set neighborhood relation, listed below, provide an alternative axiomatic characterization of proximity spaces.

For all subsets A , B , C , D ⊆ ⊆ X {\displaystyle A,B,C,D\subseteq X} X ≪ ≪ X {\displaystyle X\ll X} A ≪ ≪ B {\displaystyle A\ll B} implies A ⊆ ⊆ B {\displaystyle A\subseteq B} A ⊆ ⊆ B ≪ ≪ C ⊆ ⊆ D {\displaystyle A\subseteq B\ll C\subseteq D} implies A ≪ ≪ D {\displaystyle A\ll D} ( A ≪ ≪ B {\displaystyle A\ll B} and A ≪ ≪ C {\displaystyle A\ll C} ) implies A ≪ ≪ B ∩ ∩ C {\displaystyle A\ll B\cap C} A ≪ ≪ B {\displaystyle A\ll B} implies X ∖ ∖ B ≪ ≪ X ∖ ∖ A {\displaystyle X\setminus B\ll X\setminus A} A ≪ ≪ B {\displaystyle A\ll B} implies that there exists some E {\displaystyle E} such that A ≪ ≪ E ≪ ≪ B .

{\displaystyle A\ll E\ll B.} A proximity space is called separated if { x } δ δ { y } {\displaystyle \{x\}\;\delta \;\{y\}} implies x = y .

{\displaystyle x=y.} A proximity or proximal map is one that preserves nearness, that is, given f : ( X , δ δ ) → → ( X ∗ ∗ , δ δ ∗ ∗ ) , {\displaystyle f:(X,\delta )\to \left(X^{*},\delta ^{*}\right),} if A δ δ B {\displaystyle A\;\delta \;B} in X , {\displaystyle X,} then f [ A ] δ δ ∗ ∗ f [ B ] {\displaystyle f[A]\;\delta ^{*}\;f[B]} in X ∗ ∗ .

{\displaystyle X^{*}.} Equivalently, a map is proximal if the inverse map preserves proximal neighborhoodness. In the same notation, this means if C ≪ ≪ ∗ ∗ D {\displaystyle C\ll ^{*}D} holds in X ∗ ∗ , {\displaystyle X^{*},} then f − − 1 [ C ] ≪ ≪ f − − 1 [ D ] {\displaystyle f^{-1}[C]\ll f^{-1}[D]} holds in X .

{\displaystyle X.} Properties [ edit ] Given a proximity space, one can define a topology by letting A ↦ ↦ { x : { x } δ δ A } {\displaystyle A\mapsto \left\{x:\{x\}\;\delta \;A\right\}} be a Kuratowski closure operator . If the proximity space is separated, the resulting topology is Hausdorff . Proximity maps will be continuous between the induced topologies.

The resulting topology is always completely regular . This can be proven by imitating the usual proofs of Urysohn's lemma , using the last property of proximal neighborhoods to create the infinite increasing chain used in proving the lemma.

Given a compact Hausdorff space, there is a unique proximity space whose corresponding topology is the given topology: A {\displaystyle A} is near B {\displaystyle B} if and only if their closures intersect. More generally, proximities classify the compactifications of a completely regular Hausdorff space.

A uniform space X {\displaystyle X} induces a proximity relation by declaring A {\displaystyle A} is near B {\displaystyle B} if and only if A × × B {\displaystyle A\times B} has nonempty intersection with every entourage.

Uniformly continuous maps will then be proximally continuous.
