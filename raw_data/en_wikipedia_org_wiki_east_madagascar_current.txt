The East Madagascar Current is an oceanic flow feature near Madagascar . It flows southward from 20°S on the east side of Madagascar to the southern limit at Cape Saint Marie and subsequently feeds the Agulhas Current . Its flow is complicated by large cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies .

The East Madagascar Current has a controlling role in the western boundary current of the southwest Indian Ocean together with the Mozambique Current .  The mean speed of the East Madagascar Current varies between 0.2–0–9 m/s (0.66–0.00–29.53 ft/s) with a peak in spring and the lowest point in summer.

[ 1 ] It creates a high-pressure area and affects the Indian Monsoon .

[ 2 ] The East Madagascar Current is intense and narrow and retroflects into the central Indian Ocean south of Madagascar similarly to the Agulhas Current south of South Africa.
