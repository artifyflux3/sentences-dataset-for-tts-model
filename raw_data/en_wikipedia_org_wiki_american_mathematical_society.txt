The society is one of the four parts of the Joint Policy Board for Mathematics and a member of the Conference Board of the Mathematical Sciences .

History [ edit ] The AMS was founded in 1888 as the New York Mathematical Society , the brainchild of Thomas Fiske , who was impressed by the London Mathematical Society on a visit to England.

John Howard Van Amringe became the first president while Fiske became secretary.

[ 2 ] The society soon decided to publish a journal, but ran into some resistance over concerns about competing with the American Journal of Mathematics . The result was the Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society , with Fiske as editor-in-chief. The de facto journal, as intended, was influential in increasing membership. The popularity of the Bulletin soon led to the launches of the Transactions of the American Mathematical Society and Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society , which were also de facto journals.

In 1891, Charlotte Scott of Britain became the first woman to join the AMS, then called the New York Mathematical Society.

[ 3 ] The society reorganized under its present name (American Mathematical Society) and became a national society in 1894, [ 4 ] and that year Scott became the first woman on the first Council of the society.

[ 5 ] In 1927 Anna Pell-Wheeler became the first woman to present a lecture at the society's Colloquium.

[ 6 ] In 1951 there was a southeastern sectional meeting of the Mathematical Association of America in Nashville .

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] The citation delivered at the 2007 MAA awards presentation, where Lee Lorch received a standing ovation, recorded that: " Lee Lorch , the chair of the mathematics department at Fisk University , and three Black colleagues, Evelyn Boyd (now Granville), Walter Brown, and H. M. Holloway came to the meeting and were able to attend the scientific sessions. However, the organizer for the closing banquet refused to honor the reservations of these four mathematicians. (Letters in Science, August 10, 1951, pp. 161–162 spell out the details). Lorch and his colleagues wrote to the governing bodies of the AMS [American Mathematical Society] and MAA seeking bylaws against discrimination. Bylaws were not changed, but non-discriminatory policies were established and have been strictly observed since then.

" [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] Also in 1951, the American Mathematical Society's headquarters moved from New York City to Providence, Rhode Island . The society later added an office in Ann Arbor, Michigan in 1965 [ 13 ] and an office in Washington, D.C.

in 1992.

In 1954 the society called for the creation of a new teaching degree, a Doctor of Arts in Mathematics, similar to a PhD but without a research thesis.

[ 14 ] In the 1970s, as reported in "A Brief History of the Association for Women in Mathematics : The Presidents' Perspectives" by Lenore Blum , "In those years the AMS was governed by what could only be called an 'old boys network,' closed to all but those in the inner circle." Mary W. Gray challenged that situation by "sitting in on the Council meeting in Atlantic City. When she was told she had to leave, she refused saying she would wait until the police came. (Mary relates the story somewhat differently: When she was told she had to leave, she responded she could find no rules in the by-laws restricting attendance at Council meetings. She was then told it was by 'gentlemen's agreement.' Naturally Mary replied 'Well, obviously I'm no gentleman.') After that time, Council meetings were open to observers and the process of democratization of the Society had begun." [ 15 ] Also, in 1971 the AMS established its Joint Committee on Women in the Mathematical Sciences (JCW), which later became a joint committee of multiple scholarly societies.

[ 16 ] Julia Robinson was the first female president of the American Mathematical Society (1983–1984), but was unable to complete her term as she was suffering from leukemia .

[ 17 ] In 1988, the Journal of the American Mathematical Society was created, as the flagship journal of the AMS.

AMS and mathematical research [ edit ] The American Mathematical Society plays a significant role in advancing mathematical research by fostering collaboration, supporting early-career researchers, and maintaining influential publications and databases.

Research collaborations and support [ edit ] The AMS facilitates collaboration among mathematicians through a variety of programs aimed at different career stages. The Mathematical Research Communities , established in 2008, provides early-career researchers with opportunities to engage in intensive research workshops, collaborate with peers, and receive mentoring from senior mathematicians. These programs often lead to the formation of long-term research groups that contribute to emerging fields in mathematics.

[ 18 ] In addition, the AMS supports Research Experiences for Undergraduates through advocacy and funding partnerships, ensuring that undergraduate students are exposed to high-level mathematical research.

[ 19 ] The AMS also offers travel grants and fellowships to encourage participation in international conferences and collaborative research projects.

[ 20 ] Influence on policy and education [ edit ] Advocacy for mathematics funding [ edit ] The AMS advocates for federal funding for mathematical research.

[ 21 ] It collaborates with organizations such as the National Science Foundation and the National Academy of Sciences to promote funding initiatives. The AMS is also a member of the Joint Policy Board for Mathematics , which works with policymakers to emphasize the role of mathematics in technological advancements and national security.

[ citation needed ] In partnership with the American Association for the Advancement of Science , the AMS has contributed to discussions on STEM workforce development and the applications of mathematics in areas such as cybersecurity and data science . The society has supported initiatives for stable funding in mathematical research, citing its importance in economic growth and scientific development.

[ 22 ] Meetings [ edit ] The AMS, along with more than a dozen other organizations, holds the largest annual research mathematics meeting in the world, the Joint Mathematics Meeting , in early January. The 2019 Joint Mathematics Meeting in Baltimore drew approximately 6,000 attendees. Each of the four regional sections of the AMS (Central, Eastern, Southeastern, and Western) holds meetings in the spring and fall of each year. The society also co-sponsors meetings with other international mathematical societies.

Fellows [ edit ] See also: Category:Fellows of the American Mathematical Society The AMS selects an annual class of Fellows who have made outstanding contributions to the advancement of mathematics.

[ 23 ] Publications [ edit ] The AMS publishes Mathematical Reviews , a database of reviews of mathematical publications, various journals, and books,
and maintains the associated online version MathSciNet . In 1997 the AMS acquired Chelsea Publishing Company , which it uses as an imprint. In 2017, the AMS acquired MAA Press, the book publishing program of the Mathematical Association of America . The AMS has continued to publish books under the MAA Press imprint.

( January 2025 ) Some prizes are awarded jointly with other mathematical organizations. See specific articles for details.

Bôcher Memorial Prize Cole Prize David P. Robbins Prize Fulkerson Prize Leroy P. Steele Prizes Morgan Prize Norbert Wiener Prize in Applied Mathematics Oswald Veblen Prize in Geometry Outreach [ edit ] The AMS creates outreach materials aimed at middle school, high school, and college students. These include: Posters about mathematicians and mathematics Mathematical Moments : posters and interviews about applications of math to science and society Math in the Media : a monthly rundown of news articles that mention math, paired with classroom activities on the relevant math concepts.

Typesetting [ edit ] The AMS was an early advocate of the typesetting program TeX , requiring that contributions be written in it and producing its own packages AMS-TeX and AMS-LaTeX . TeX and LaTeX are now ubiquitous in mathematical publishing.

Presidents [ edit ] The AMS is led by the president, who is elected for a two-year term, and cannot serve for two consecutive terms.

[ 25 ] The current president is Ravi Vakil , who took office in February 2025.
