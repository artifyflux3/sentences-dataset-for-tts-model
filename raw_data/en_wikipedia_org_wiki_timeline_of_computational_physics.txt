( May 2017 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) The following timeline starts with the invention of the modern computer in the late interwar period.

1930s [ edit ] John Vincent Atanasoff and Clifford Berry create the first electronic non-programmable, digital computing device, the Atanasoff–Berry Computer , that lasted from 1937 to 1942.

1940s [ edit ] Nuclear bomb and ballistics simulations at Los Alamos National Laboratory and Ballistic Research Laboratory (BRL), respectively.

[ 1 ] Monte Carlo simulation (voted one of the top 10 algorithms of the 20th century by Jack Dongarra and Francis Sullivan in the 2000 issue of Computing in Science and Engineering) [ 2 ] is invented at  Los Alamos National Laboratory by John von Neumann , Stanislaw Ulam and Nicholas Metropolis .

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] First hydrodynamic simulations performed at Los Alamos National Laboratory.

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] Ulam and von Neumann introduce the notion of cellular automata .

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] 1950s [ edit ] Equations of State Calculations by Fast Computing Machines introduces the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm .

[ 10 ] Also, important earlier independent work by Berni Alder and Stan Frankel .

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] Enrico Fermi , Ulam and John Pasta with help from Mary Tsingou , discover the Fermi–Pasta–Ulam-Tsingou problem .

[ 13 ] Research initiated into percolation theory .

[ 14 ] Molecular dynamics is formulated by Alder and Tom E. Wainwright.

[ 15 ] 1960s [ edit ] Using computational investigations of the 3-body problem , Michael Minovitch formulates the gravity assist method.

[ 16 ] [ 17 ] Glauber dynamics is invented for the Ising model by Roy J. Glauber .

[ 18 ] Edward Lorenz discovers the butterfly effect on a computer, attracting interest in chaos theory .

[ 19 ] Molecular dynamics is independently invented by Aneesur Rahman .

[ 20 ] Walter Kohn instigates the development of density functional theory (with L.J. Sham and Pierre Hohenberg ), [ 21 ] [ 22 ] for which he shared the Nobel Chemistry Prize (1998).

[ 23 ] Martin Kruskal and Norman Zabusky follow up the Fermi–Pasta–Ulam problem with further numerical experiments, and coin the term " soliton ".

[ 24 ] [ 25 ] Kawasaki dynamics is invented for the Ising model.

[ 26 ] Loup Verlet (re)discovers a numerical integration algorithm , [ 27 ] (first used in 1791 by Jean Baptiste Delambre , by P. H. Cowell and A. C. C. Crommelin in 1909, and by Carl Fredrik Störmer in 1907, [ 28 ] hence the alternative names Störmer's method or the Verlet-Störmer method) for dynamics, and the Verlet list.

[ 27 ] 1970s [ edit ] Computer algebra replicates the work of Boris Delaunay in Lunar theory .

[ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] [ 32 ] [ 33 ] Martinus Veltman 's calculations at CERN lead him and Gerard 't Hooft to valuable insights into renormalizability of electroweak theory .

[ 34 ] The computation has been cited as a key reason for the award of the Nobel Physics Prize that has been given to both.

[ 35 ] Jean Hardy, Yves Pomeau and Olivier de Pazzis introduce the first lattice gas model , abbreviated as the HPP model after its authors.

[ 36 ] [ 37 ] These later evolved into lattice Boltzmann models .

Kenneth G. Wilson shows that continuum quantum chromodynamics (QCD) is recovered for an infinitely large lattice with its sites infinitesimally close to one another, thereby beginning lattice QCD .

[ 38 ] 1980s [ edit ] Italian physicists Roberto Car and Michele Parrinello invent the Car–Parrinello method .

[ 39 ] Swendsen–Wang algorithm is invented in the field of Monte Carlo simulations.

[ 40 ] Fast multipole method is invented by Vladimir Rokhlin and Leslie Greengard (voted one of the top 10 algorithms of the 20th century).

[ 41 ] [ 42 ] [ 43 ] Ullli Wolff invents the Wolff algorithm for statistical physics and Monte Carlo simulation.
