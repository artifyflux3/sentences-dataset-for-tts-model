[ 16 ] Funding [ edit ] The Horowitz Freedom Center has paid Spencer, as Jihad Watch's director, a $132,000 salary in 2010. Jihad Watch has also received funding from donors supporting the Israeli right , [ 15 ] and a variety of individuals and foundations, like Bradley Foundation and Joyce Chernick, wife of Aubrey Chernick.

[ 17 ] Politico said that during 2008–2010, "the lion's share of the $920,000 it [David Horowitz Freedom Center] provided over the past three years to Jihad Watch came from [Joyce] Chernick".

[ 17 ] In 2015, Jihad Watch received approximately $100,000 in revenue, with three quarters of that revenue coming from donations.

[ 6 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] Jihad Watch has been criticized for its portrayal of Islam as a totalitarian political doctrine .

[ 11 ] The Southern Poverty Law Center and Anti-Defamation League consider Jihad Watch an active hate group due to its "extreme hostility toward Muslims." [ 18 ] Guardian writer Brian Whitaker described Jihad Watch as a "notoriously Islamophobic website", [ 19 ] while other critics such as Dinesh D'Souza , [ 20 ] Karen Armstrong and Cathy Young , pointed to what they see as "deliberate mischaracterizations" of Islam and Muslims by Spencer as inherently violent and therefore prone to terrorism.

[ 13 ] [ 21 ] Benazir Bhutto , the Pakistani Prime Minister, in her book Reconciliation: Islam, Democracy, and the West , wrote that Spencer uses Jihad Watch to spread misinformation and hatred of Islam. She added that he presents a skewed, one-sided, and inflammatory story that only helps to sow the seed of civilizational conflict.

[ 22 ] Abdel Bari Atwan , the editor-in-chief of the London-based pan-Arab newspaper Al-Quds Al-Arabi , wrote that "Most of the effective surveillance work tracking jihadi sites is being done not by the FBI or MI6, but by private groups. The best-known and most successful of those are [ Internet ] Haganah ... SITE [ Institute ] ... and Jihad Watch." [ 23 ] The website was cited 64 times by Norwegian far-right terrorist Anders Behring Breivik , who committed the 2011 Norway attacks .

[ 24 ] In 2017, Christine Douglass-Williams was terminated as a board member of the Canadian Race Relations Foundation for her writings on the blog.
