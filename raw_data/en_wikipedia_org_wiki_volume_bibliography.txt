For typesetting a book, see Booksetting .

Monographs divided into several volumes Journal issues bound into volumes in a library A volume is a physical book . It may be printed or handwritten . The term is commonly used to identify a single book that is part of a larger collection. Volumes are typically identified sequentially with Roman or Arabic numerals , e.g. "volume III" or "volume 3", commonly abbreviated to "Vol.".

[ 1 ] Volumes may be published directly, or they may be created out of multiple bound issues. For instance, a library that subscribes to a periodical and wishes to preserve it typically takes a set of the issues and has them bound into a volume.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] A publisher may also separately publish a volume out of previously published issues; this is common with graphic novels . A volume may also be composed of entries, as in an encyclopedia , or chapters, as in a monograph .

The term is also used as an identifier for a sequence of periodicals. This is generally based on a single calendar year, but not always. For instance, a school magazine might start each new volume at the beginning of the academic year or at the beginning of each term/semester. Likewise, a journal may start new volumes for each anniversary after its original inception. Thus, all issues published in the N th term or year will be classified under the N th volume.

[ 1 ] The original function of labelling issues with a volume at publication time was to provide a standard way for libraries to later bind the issues into a physical volume.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] A part (commonly abbreviated to "Pt.") can be a special sub-division of a volume or it can be the highest level division of a journal. Parts are often designated with letters or names, e.g. "B", "Supplement".
