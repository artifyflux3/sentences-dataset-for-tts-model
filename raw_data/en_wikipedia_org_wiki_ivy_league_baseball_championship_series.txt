The top four finishers from the round-robin regular season participate in a double elimination tournament held at the site of the regular season champion, with the winner earning the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA Division I Baseball Championship .

Penn won the inaugural Ivy League tournament in 2023.

From 1993 until 2022 (except for 2020 and 2021 when the series was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic [ 1 ] ), the league's top two teams would play in a best-of-three series at the end of the regular season, which was known as the Ivy League Championship Series .

History [ edit ] In 1930, six of the eight Ivy League teams formed the Eastern Intercollegiate Baseball League .

Harvard joined in 1934, while Brown , Army and Navy joined in 1948.  When Army and Navy joined the Patriot League for the 1993 season, the Ivy League began sponsoring baseball.

From 1993 to 2017, the teams are split into two divisions; the Mid-Atlantic members are in the Lou Gehrig Division, and the New England members are in the Red Rolfe Division. The winners of each division would meet in a best-of-three championship series to determine the Ivy League's automatic bid to the NCAA Division I baseball tournament .

The divisions were dissolved in 2018, with the top two teams from the regular season meeting in the championship series. The team with the best regular season record is named the Ivy League champion. However, the winner of the championship series still gained the league's automatic bid to the NCAA Division I baseball tournament . The event was canceled for 2020 and 2021 due to the coronavirus pandemic .

[ 1 ] Starting in 2023, the Ivy League would replace the series format with a four-team double elimination tournament held at the site of the regular season champion. The winner of the tournament would receive an automatic berth to the NCAA tournament.
