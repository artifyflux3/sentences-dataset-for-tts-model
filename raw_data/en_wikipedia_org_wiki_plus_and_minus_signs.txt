The **plus sign** (+) and the **minus sign** (−) are [mathematical symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_mathematical_symbols "Glossary of mathematical symbols") used to denote [positive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_(mathematics) "Sign (mathematics)") and [negative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_(mathematics) "Sign (mathematics)") functions, respectively. In addition, the symbol + represents the operation of [addition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition "Addition"), which results in a [sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sum_(mathematics) "Sum (mathematics)"), while the symbol − represents [subtraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtraction "Subtraction"), resulting in a [difference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_(mathematics) "Difference (mathematics)").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plus_and_minus_signs#cite_note-Weisstein-1) Their use has been extended to many other meanings, more or less analogous. _Plus_ and _minus_ are [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin "Latin") terms meaning 'more' and 'less', respectively.

The forms + and − are used in many countries around the world. Other designs include U+FB29﬩[HEBREW LETTER ALTERNATIVE PLUS SIGN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EF%AC%A9 "﬩") for plus and U+2052⁒[COMMERCIAL MINUS SIGN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E2%81%92 "⁒") for minus.

Though the signs now seem as familiar as the [alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet "Alphabet") or the [Arabic numerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_numerals "Arabic numerals"), they are not of great antiquity. The [Egyptian hieroglyphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_hieroglyph "Egyptian hieroglyph") sign for addition, for example, resembles a pair of legs walking in the direction in which the text was written ([Egyptian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_language "Egyptian language") could be written either from right to left or left to right), with the reverse sign indicating subtraction:[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plus_and_minus_signs#cite_note-2)

[Nicole Oresme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicole_Oresme "Nicole Oresme")'s [manuscripts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuscript "Manuscript") from the 14th century show what may be one of the earliest uses of + as a sign for plus.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plus_and_minus_signs#cite_note-3)

In early 15th century Europe, the letters "P" and "M" were generally used.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plus_and_minus_signs#cite_note-ley196504-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plus_and_minus_signs#cite_note-5) The symbols (P with overline, p̄, for _più_ (more), i.e., plus, and M with overline, m̄, for _meno_ (less), i.e., minus) appeared for the first time in [Luca Pacioli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luca_Pacioli "Luca Pacioli")'s mathematics [compendium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compendium "Compendium"), _[Summa de arithmetica, geometria, proportioni et proportionalità](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summa\_de\_arithmetica "Summa de arithmetica")_, first printed and published in [Venice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice "Venice") in 1494.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plus_and_minus_signs#cite_note-6)

The + sign is a simplification of the [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_language "Latin language"): _et_ (comparable to the evolution of the [ampersand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampersand "Ampersand")&).[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plus_and_minus_signs#cite_note-7) The − may be derived from a [macron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macron_(diacritic) "Macron (diacritic)")◌̄ written over ⟨m⟩ when used to indicate subtraction; or it may come from a shorthand version of the letter ⟨m⟩ itself.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plus_and_minus_signs#cite_note-8)

From [Johannes Widmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Widmann "Johannes Widmann")'s book on "handy and pretty [arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic "Arithmetic") for all [merchants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merchant "Merchant")"[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plus_and_minus_signs#cite_note-widmann1489-9)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plus_and_minus_signs#cite_note-widmann1508-10)

In his 1489 treatise, [Johannes Widmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Widmann "Johannes Widmann") referred to the symbols − and + as _minus_ and _mer_ (Modern German _mehr_; "more"): _"[...] was − ist das ist minus [...] und das + das ist mer das zu addirst"_.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plus_and_minus_signs#cite_note-widmann1489-9)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plus_and_minus_signs#cite_note-widmann1508-10)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plus_and_minus_signs#cite_note-OED-11) They were not used for addition and subtraction in the treatise, but were used to indicate surplus and deficit; usage in the modern sense is attested in a 1518 book by [Henricus Grammateus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henricus_Grammateus "Henricus Grammateus").[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plus_and_minus_signs#cite_note-12)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plus_and_minus_signs#cite_note-13)

[Robert Recorde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Recorde "Robert Recorde"), the designer of the [equals sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equals_sign "Equals sign"), introduced plus and minus to Britain in 1557 in _[The Whetstone of Witte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Whetstone\_of\_Witte "The Whetstone of Witte")_:[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plus_and_minus_signs#cite_note-14) "There be other 2 signes in often use of which the first is made thus + and betokeneth more: the other is thus made − and betokeneth lesse."

The plus sign (+) is a [binary operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_operator "Binary operator") that indicates [addition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition "Addition"), as in 2+3=5. It can also serve as a [unary operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unary_operator "Unary operator") that leaves its [operand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operand "Operand")[unchanged](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_function "Identity function") (+_x_ means the same as _x_). This notation may be used when it is desired to emphasize the positiveness of a number, especially in contrast with the [negative numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_number "Negative number") (+5 versus −5).

The plus sign can also indicate many other operations, depending on the mathematical system under consideration. Many [algebraic structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_structure "Algebraic structure"), such as [vector spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space") and [matrix rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_ring "Matrix ring"), have some operation which is called, or is equivalent to, addition. It is though conventional to use the plus sign to only denote [commutative operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_property "Commutative property").[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plus_and_minus_signs#cite_note-Fraleigh-15)

The symbol is also used in [chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry "Chemistry") and [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics"). For more, see [§Other uses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plus_and_minus_signs#Other_uses).

"−" (minus sign) redirects here. For the Ed Sheeran album, see [− (album)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E2%88%92_(album) "− (album)")

The minus sign (−) has three main uses in mathematics:[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plus_and_minus_signs#cite_note-16)

1.   The [subtraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtraction "Subtraction") operator: a [binary operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_operator "Binary operator") to indicate the operation of subtraction, as in 5 −3=2. Subtraction is the inverse of addition.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plus_and_minus_signs#cite_note-Weisstein-1)
2.   The [function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics) "Function (mathematics)") whose [value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(mathematics) "Value (mathematics)") for any [real](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number") or [complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number "Complex number")[argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_of_a_function "Argument of a function") is the [additive inverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_inverse "Additive inverse") of that argument. For example, if _x_=3, then −_x_=−3, but if _x_=−3, then −_x_=+3. Similarly, −(−_x_)=_x_.
3.   A [prefix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefix "Prefix") of a numeric constant. When it is placed immediately before an unsigned number, the combination names a negative number, the additive inverse of the positive number that the numeral would otherwise name. In this usage, '−5' names a number the same way 'semicircle' names a geometric figure, with the caveat that 'semi' does not have a separate use as a function name.

In many contexts, it does not matter whether the second or the third of these usages is intended: −5 is the same number. When it is important to distinguish them, a raised minus sign (¯) is sometimes used for negative constants, as in [elementary education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plus_and_minus_signs#ed), the programming language [APL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_(programming_language) "APL (programming language)"), and some early graphing calculators.[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plus_and_minus_signs#cite_note-17)

All three uses can be referred to as "minus" in everyday speech, though the binary operator is sometimes read as "take away".[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plus_and_minus_signs#cite_note-18) In American English nowadays, −5 (for example) is generally referred to as "negative five" though speakers born before 1950 often refer to it as "minus five". (Temperatures tend to follow the older usage; −5° is generally called "minus five degrees".)[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plus_and_minus_signs#cite_note-19) Further, a few textbooks in the United States encourage −_x_ to be read as "the opposite of _x_" or "the additive inverse of _x_"—to avoid giving the impression that −_x_ is necessarily negative (since _x_ itself may already be negative).[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plus_and_minus_signs#cite_note-20)

In mathematics and most programming languages, the rules for the [order of operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_operations "Order of operations") mean that −5 2 is equal to −25: [Exponentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation "Exponentiation") binds more strongly than the unary minus, which binds more strongly than multiplication or division. However, in some programming languages ([Microsoft Excel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Excel "Microsoft Excel") in particular), unary operators bind strongest, so in those cases `−5^2` is 25, but `0−5^2` is −25.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plus_and_minus_signs#cite_note-21)

Similar to the plus sign, the minus sign is also used in [chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry "Chemistry") and [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics"). (For more, see [§Other uses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plus_and_minus_signs#Other_uses) below.)

Use in elementary education
---------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Plus_and_minus_signs&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Use in elementary education")]

Some elementary teachers use raised minus signs before numbers to disambiguate them from the operation of subtraction.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plus_and_minus_signs#cite_note-22) The same convention is also used in some computer languages. For example, subtracting −5 from 3 might be read as "positive three take away negative 5", and be shown as

3 −−5 becomes 3+5=8,
which can be read as:

+3−1(−5)
or even as

+3−−5 becomes +3++5=+8.
When placed after a number, a plus sign can indicate an open range of numbers. For example, "18+" is commonly used as shorthand for "ages 18 and up" although "eighteen plus", for example, is now common usage.

In US [grading systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_in_education "Grading in education"), the plus sign indicates a grade one level higher and the minus sign a grade lower. For example, B− ("B minus") is one grade lower than B. In some occasions, this is extended to two plus or minus signs (e.g., A++ being two grades higher than A).[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

A common trend in branding, particularly with streaming video services, has been the use of the plus sign at the end of brand names, e.g. [Google+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google%2B "Google+"), [Disney+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney%2B "Disney+"), [Paramount+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount%2B "Paramount+"), and [Apple TV+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_TV%2B "Apple TV+"). Since the word "plus" can mean an advantage, or an additional amount of something, such "+" signs imply that a product offers extra features or benefits.

Positive and negative are sometimes abbreviated as +ve and −ve,[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plus_and_minus_signs#cite_note-23) and on batteries and cell terminals are often marked with + and −.

In mathematics the [one-sided limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-sided_limit "One-sided limit")_x_ → _a_+ means _x_ approaches _a_ from the right (i.e., right-sided limit), and _x_ → _a_− means _x_ approaches _a_ from the left (i.e., left-sided limit). For example, ![Image 2: {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{x}}\rightarrow +\infty }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bff8b0920d57606fedd10bc73579d907a43cb61f) as _x_ → 0+ but ![Image 3: {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{x}}\rightarrow -\infty }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a748f7fe859518b43d47788d7a2680927ec2b5eb) as _x_ → 0−.

When placed after [special sets of numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)#Special_sets_of_numbers_in_mathematics "Set (mathematics)"), plus and minus signs are used to indicate that only positive numbers and negative numbers are included, respectively. For example, ![Image 4: {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} ^{+}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/628778fcf14bd3629e9b9ebacffa172b0ad6ce41) is the set of all positive [integers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer "Integer") and ![Image 5: {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} ^{-}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1d265f6ad41c1623a6477b2cb4336208c7b6c1d6) is the set of all negative integers. In these cases, a subscript 0 may also be added to clarify that 0 is included.

[Blood types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_types "Blood types") are often qualified with a plus or minus to indicate the presence or absence of the [Rh factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rh_factor "Rh factor"). For example, A+ means [type A blood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABO_blood_group_system "ABO blood group system") with the Rh factor present, while B− means type B blood with the Rh factor absent.

In music, [augmented chords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_triad#Augmented_chord_table "Augmented triad") are symbolized with a plus sign, although this practice is not universal (as there are other methods for spelling those chords). For example, "C+" is read "C augmented chord". Sometimes the plus is written as a [superscript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superscript "Superscript").

As well as the normal mathematical usage, plus and minus signs may be used for a number of other purposes in computing.

Plus and minus signs are often used in [tree view](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_view "Tree view") on a computer screen—to show if a folder is collapsed or not.

In some programming languages, [concatenation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concatenation "Concatenation") of [strings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science) "String (computer science)") is written `"a" + "b"`, and results in `"ab"`.

In most programming languages, subtraction and negation are indicated with the ASCII [hyphen-minus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen-minus "Hyphen-minus") character, `-`. In [APL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_(programming_language) "APL (programming language)") a raised minus sign (here written using U+00AF¯MACRON) is used to denote a negative number, as in `¯3`. While in [J](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J_(programming_language) "J (programming language)") a negative number is denoted by an [underscore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underscore "Underscore"), as in `_5`.

In [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language) "C (programming language)") and some other computer programming languages, two plus signs indicate the [increment operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Increment_operator "Increment operator") and two minus signs a decrement; the position of the operator before or after the variable indicates whether the new or old value is read from it. For example, if x equals 6, then `y = x++` increments x to 7 but sets y to 6, whereas `y = ++x` would set both x and y to 7. By extension, `++` is sometimes used in computing terminology to signify an improvement, as in the name of the language [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B "C++").

In [regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression "Regular expression"), `+` is often used to indicate "1 or more" in a pattern to be matched. For example, `x+` means "one or more of the letter x". This is the [Kleene plus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleene_star#Kleene_plus "Kleene star") notation. Hyphen-minus usually indicates a range (`[A-Z]` - any capital from 'A' to 'Z'), although it can stand for itself (`[ABCDE-]` any capital from 'A' to 'E' or '-').

There is no concept of negative zero in mathematics, but in computing [−0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signed_zero "Signed zero") may have a separate representation from zero. In the [IEEE floating-point standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_floating-point_standard "IEEE floating-point standard"), 1/−0 is [negative infinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_infinity "Negative infinity") (![Image 6: {\displaystyle -\infty }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ca2608c4b5fd3bffc73585f8c67e379b4e99b6f1)) whereas 1/0 is [positive infinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity "Infinity") ([![Image 7: {\displaystyle \infty }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c26c105004f30c27aa7c2a9c601550a4183b1f21)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E2%88%9E "∞")).

`+` is also used to denote added lines in [`diff`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff "Diff") output in the [context format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff#Context_format "Diff") or the [unified format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff#Unified_format "Diff").

In physics, the use of plus and minus signs for different [electrical charges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_charge "Electrical charge") was introduced by [Georg Christoph Lichtenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Christoph_Lichtenberg "Georg Christoph Lichtenberg").

In chemistry, superscripted plus and minus signs are used to indicate an ion with a positive or negative charge of 1 (e.g., NH+

4). If the charge is greater than 1, a number indicating the charge is written before the sign (as in SO 2−

4).

A plus sign prefixed to a telephone number is used to indicate the form used for [International Direct Dialing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Direct_Dialing "International Direct Dialing").[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plus_and_minus_signs#cite_note-24) Its precise usage varies by technology and national standards. In the [International Phonetic Alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet "International Phonetic Alphabet"), [subscripted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subscript "Subscript") plus and minus signs are used as diacritics to indicate [advanced or retracted articulations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_articulation "Relative articulation") of speech sounds.

The minus sign is also used as tone letter in the orthographies of [Dan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_language "Dan language"), [Krumen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krumen_language "Krumen language"), [Karaboro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karaboro_languages "Karaboro languages"), [Mwan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mwan_language "Mwan language"), [Wan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wan_language "Wan language"), [Yaouré](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaour%C3%A9 "Yaouré"), [Wè](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W%C3%A8_language "Wè language"), [Nyabwa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyabwa_language "Nyabwa language"), and [Godié](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godie_language "Godie language").[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plus_and_minus_signs#cite_note-25) The Unicode character used for the tone letter (U+02D7˗MODIFIER LETTER MINUS SIGN) is different from the mathematical minus sign.

The plus sign sometimes represents /[ɨ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_central_unrounded_vowel "Close central unrounded vowel")/ in the orthography of [Huichol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huichol_language#Orthography "Huichol language").[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plus_and_minus_signs#cite_note-26)

In the [algebraic notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_notation_(chess) "Algebraic notation (chess)") used to record games of [chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess "Chess"), the plus sign + is used to denote a move that puts the opponent into [check](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Check_(chess) "Check (chess)"), while a double plus ++ is sometimes used to denote [double check](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_check "Double check"). Combinations of the plus and minus signs are used to evaluate a move (+/−, +/=, =/+, −/+).

In linguistics, a superscript plus + sometimes replaces the [asterisk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk "Asterisk"), which denotes unattested [linguistic reconstruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_reconstruction "Linguistic reconstruction").

In [botanical names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botanical_name "Botanical name"), a plus sign denotes [graft-chimaera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft-chimaera "Graft-chimaera").

In Catholicism, the plus sign before a last name denotes a [Bishop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishops_in_the_Catholic_Church "Bishops in the Catholic Church"), and a double plus is used to denote an Archbishop.

"÷" being used as a minus sign (not as a division sign) in an excerpt from an official Norwegian trading statement form called «Næringsoppgave 1» for the taxation year 2010

There is a [commercial minus sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_minus_sign "Commercial minus sign"), ⁒, which is (or was) used in Germany and Scandinavia. The symbol ÷, still used in many Anglophone countries as a [division sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_sign "Division sign"), is (or was) used [to denote subtraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obelus#In_mathematics "Obelus") in [Scandinavia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandinavia "Scandinavia").[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plus_and_minus_signs#cite_note-27)

The [hyphen-minus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen-minus "Hyphen-minus") symbol (-) is the form of [hyphen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen "Hyphen") most commonly used in digital [documents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document "Document"). On most keyboards, it is the only character that resembles a [minus sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minus_sign "Minus sign") or a [dash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dash "Dash") so it is also used for these.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plus_and_minus_signs#cite_note-28) The name _hyphen-minus_ derives from the original [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII "ASCII") standard,[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plus_and_minus_signs#cite_note-29) where it was called _hyphen–(minus)_.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plus_and_minus_signs#cite_note-30) The character is referred to as a _hyphen_, a _minus sign_, or a _dash_ according to the context where it is being used.

A [Jewish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jew "Jew") tradition that dates from at least the 19th century is to write _plus_ using the symbol ﬩, to avoid the writing of a symbol + that could look like a [Christian cross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_cross "Christian cross").[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plus_and_minus_signs#cite_note-JE-31)[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plus_and_minus_signs#cite_note-University_of_California-32) This practice was adopted into [Israeli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel "Israel") schools and is still commonplace today in [elementary schools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_school "Elementary school") (including [secular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilonim "Hilonim") schools) but in fewer [secondary schools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school "Secondary school").[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plus_and_minus_signs#cite_note-University_of_California-32) It is also used occasionally in books by religious authors, but most books for adults use the international symbol +.

For example, 27 hex is defined in ANSI X3.4 as apostrophe (closing single quotation mark; acute accent), and 2D hex as hyphen minus. In general, the Unicode standard provides the same interpretation for the equivalent code values, without adding to or subtracting from their semantics. The Unicode standard supplies unambiguous codes elsewhere for the most useful particular interpretations of these ASCII values; the corresponding unambiguous characters are cross-referenced in the character names list for this block. In a few cases, the Unicode standard indicates the generic interpretation of an ASCII code in the name of the corresponding Unicode character, for example U+0027 is APOSTROPHE-QUOTE'.
