Machine translation, like DeepL or Google Translate , is a useful starting point for translations, but translators must revise errors as necessary and confirm that the translation is accurate, rather than simply copy-pasting machine-translated text into the English Wikipedia.

The Verzeichnis der im deutschen Sprachbereich erschienenen Drucke des 16. Jahrhunderts (VD 16) (in English: Bibliography of Books Printed in the German Speaking Countries of the Sixteenth Century ), abbreviated VD 16 , is a project to make a retrospective German national bibliography for the sixteenth century. The project was compiled during the period 1969–1999. It is financed by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Research Foundation).

There is a corresponding German national bibliography for the seventeenth century, known as VD 17 . Together the VD 16 and VD 17 alongside the planned VD 18 ( Verzeichnis der im deutschen Sprachraum erschienenen Drucke des 18. Jahrhunderts ) fulfill a function for the bibliographic history of the German cultural zone similar to the English Short Title Catalogue for Britain and North America.
