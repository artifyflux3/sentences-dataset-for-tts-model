of employees 5,000 (2017) Official website cengagegroup .com Cengage Group is an American educational content, technology, and services company for higher education, K–12 , professional, and library markets. It operates in more than 20 countries around the world.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Company information [ edit ] The company is headquartered in Boston , Massachusetts, and has some 5,000 employees worldwide across nearly 38 countries.

[ 2 ] [ 4 ] It was headquartered at its Stamford, Connecticut , office until April 2014.

[ 5 ] Gale is Cengage's library reference arm and specializes in e-research and educational publishing for libraries, schools and businesses. The company creates and maintains databases that are published online, in print, as e-books and in microform.

[ 6 ] Cengage Unlimited [ edit ] On December 5, 2017, Cengage announced Cengage Unlimited, a subscription service that allows students to pay for access to the company's entire digital higher education catalog by the semester or year, rather than buying individual textbooks.

[ 7 ] This service became available during summer 2018, and was reported to be "in line with expectations" with its initial sales goal.

[ 8 ] The University of Missouri is the first university to offer this plan to all students, effective January 2019.

[ 9 ] History [ edit ] International Thomson Publishing entered the publishing business by buying Wadsworth Publishing in 1979. In 1981 International Thomson purchased the publishing operations of Litton Industries , including Van Nostrand Reinhold and Delmar.

[ 10 ] International Thomson acquired reference publisher Gale Research in 1985.

[ 11 ] International Thomson acquired South-Western Publishing from SFN in 1986.

[ 16 ] Later that year Thomson acquired the higher education title of Harcourt from Reed Elsevier , [ 17 ] and the test prep publisher Arco from IDG Books .

[ 18 ] In 2002, Wadsworth acquired F.E. Peacock Publishers.

[ 19 ] It was announced on October 25, 2006, that Thomson Learning would be offered for sale by the Thomson Corporation , with an estimated value of up to US$5 billion.

[ 22 ] In 2007, Cengage Learning sold Peterson's to Nelnet .

[ 23 ] In 2011, Cengage Learning acquired the National Geographic Society's school publishing unit, and combined this school business with the Global ELT business to create and launch the National Geographic Learning brand.

[ 24 ] In September 2013, David Shaffer retired as chairman of the company.

[ 25 ] He had previously been executive vice president of The Thomson Corporation from 2005 to 2006, and then President and CEO of both Thomson Publishing International and Thomson Learning.

[ 26 ] The company had acquired a large amount of debt through the course of its initial buyout and subsequent acquisitions, and had seen declining revenue through a shrinking market for paper textbooks. Cengage Learning filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 on July 2, 2013.

[ 22 ] [ 27 ] Cengage Learning emerged from bankruptcy on April 1, 2014, eliminating approximately $4 billion of its funded debt and securing $1.75 billion in exit financing.

The company moved its headquarters from Stamford, Connecticut , to Boston.

[ 28 ] In January 2015, they announced expansion of their LearnLaunch Accelerator program, which provides seed funding and intensive coaching to promising startups, to the University of Chihuahua in Mexico.

[ 29 ] [ 30 ] In November 2016, Cengage Learning rebranded as simply Cengage.

[ citation needed ] In May 2019, Cengage announced its potential merger with another major publisher, McGraw-Hill Education , thereby creating a duopoly with Pearson in the market and would have used McGraw-Hill as the merged corporate name with Michael Hansen as CEO.

[ 31 ] [ 32 ] It is estimated 
Cengage has 24% of the market while McGraw-Hill has 21%, Pearson, the current market leader, has about 40 percent of the market and Wiley has about 7 percent.

[ 33 ] The merger was called off on May 1, 2020.
