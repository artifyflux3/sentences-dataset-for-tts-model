( March 2012 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) In mathematics , the Routh–Hurwitz theorem gives a test to determine whether all roots of a given polynomial lie in the left-half complex plane . Polynomials with this property are called Hurwitz stable polynomials .  The Routh–Hurwitz theorem is important in dynamical systems and control theory , because the characteristic polynomial of the differential equations of a stable , linear system has roots limited to the left half plane (negative eigenvalues ).  Thus the theorem provides a mathematical test, the Routh–Hurwitz stability criterion , to determine whether a linear dynamical system is stable without solving the system.

The Routh–Hurwitz theorem was proved in 1895, and it was named after Edward John Routh and Adolf Hurwitz .

Notations [ edit ] Let f ( z ) be a polynomial (with complex coefficients ) of degree n with no roots on the imaginary axis (i.e. the line z = ic where i is the imaginary unit and c is a real number ).  Let us define real polynomials P 0 ( y ) and P 1 ( y ) by f ( iy ) = P 0 ( y ) + iP 1 ( y ) , respectively the real and imaginary parts of f on the imaginary line.

Furthermore, let us denote by: p the number of roots of f in the left half-plane (taking into account multiplicities); q the number of roots of f in the right half-plane (taking into account multiplicities); Δ arg f ( iy ) the variation of the argument of f ( iy ) when y runs from −∞ to +∞ ; w ( x ) is the number of variations of the generalized Sturm chain obtained from P 0 ( y ) and P 1 ( y ) by applying the Euclidean algorithm ; I +∞ −∞ r is the Cauchy index of the rational function r over the real line .

Statement [ edit ] With the notations introduced above, the Routh–Hurwitz theorem states that: p − − q = 1 π π Δ Δ arg ⁡ ⁡ f ( i y ) = { + I − − ∞ ∞ + ∞ ∞ P 0 ( y ) P 1 ( y ) for odd degree − − I − − ∞ ∞ + ∞ ∞ P 1 ( y ) P 0 ( y ) for even degree } = w ( + ∞ ∞ ) − − w ( − − ∞ ∞ ) .

{\displaystyle p-q={\frac {1}{\pi }}\Delta \arg f(iy)=\left.{\begin{cases}+I_{-\infty }^{+\infty }{\frac {P_{0}(y)}{P_{1}(y)}}&{\text{for odd degree}}\\[10pt]-I_{-\infty }^{+\infty }{\frac {P_{1}(y)}{P_{0}(y)}}&{\text{for even degree}}\end{cases}}\right\}=w(+\infty )-w(-\infty ).} From the first equality we can for instance conclude that when the variation of the argument of f ( iy ) is positive, then f ( z ) will have more roots to the left of the imaginary axis than to its right.
The equality p − q = w (+∞) − w (−∞) can be viewed as the complex counterpart of Sturm's theorem .  Note the differences:  in Sturm's theorem, the left member is p + q and the w from the right member is the number of variations of a Sturm chain (while w refers to a generalized Sturm chain in the present theorem).

Routh–Hurwitz stability criterion [ edit ] Main article: Routh–Hurwitz stability criterion We can easily determine a stability criterion using this theorem as it is trivial that f ( z ) is Hurwitz-stable if and only if p − q = n .  We thus obtain conditions on the coefficients of f ( z ) by imposing w (+∞) = n and w (−∞) = 0 .
