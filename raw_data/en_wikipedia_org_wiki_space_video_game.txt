_**Space**_ (also called _**Space I**_) is a [text-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based "Text-based")[role-playing video game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_video_game "Role-playing video game") for the [Apple II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II "Apple II") designed by Steven Pederson and [Sherwin Steffin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherwin_Steffin "Sherwin Steffin") of [Edu-Ware Services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edu-Ware "Edu-Ware"). It was one of the first [science fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction "Science fiction") RPGs to appear on [personal computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer "Personal computer").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(video_game)#cite_note-PeelingsV1N3-1) An expansion pack, _**Space II**_ by [David Mullich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Mullich "David Mullich"), was released in the same year.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(video_game)#cite_note-EWS80Catalog-2)

The game system was based upon the _[Traveller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traveller\_(role-playing\_game) "Traveller (role-playing game)")_ role-playing-game, created by [Game Designers' Workshop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Designers%27_Workshop "Game Designers' Workshop"), which sued Edu-Ware for copyright infringement in [1982](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1982_in_video_gaming "1982 in video gaming").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(video_game)#cite_note-lawsuit-3) In an out-of-court settlement, both _Space_ and _Space II_ were removed from the market.

Players begin by creating characters to play in a futuristic interstellar society and then enrolling them in one of the military services: Navy, Army, Scouts, Merchant Marines, and other Services. While in the service, players choose their character's training, provided they qualify for it. Depending upon characters' physical and mental abilities, they may learn such skills as brawling, bribery, swordsmanship, computers, interstellar navigation, spaceship piloting, and so on. Through training and study, characters can also increase their base physical and mental abilities.

Characters have a choice to leave the service after every four years of enlistment, provided that they have not been killed or suffered serious injury. After retiring from the service, characters can engage in one of the scenarios that are included with each version of the game. Scenarios can increase a character's wealth or grant possessions, but with the exception of the Psychodelia scenario in _Space II_, they cannot voluntarily alter a character's abilities. However, most character traits degrade over time as the character ages during gameplay. If a character dies during any of the scenarios, the text file defining the character is immediately erased from the game disk.

_Space_ was conceived by Pederson and Steffin while the former was still attending college at [UCLA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Los_Angeles "University of California, Los Angeles"). The two used the game concept to convince Rainbow Computing, a computer store that sold Edu-Ware games through its mail order catalog, to provide Pederson with an [Apple II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II "Apple II") in exchange for receiving product at cost. When Pederson and Steffin learned that Rainbow had announced _Space_ in its catalog before the game was completed, the two spent twenty-four straight hours debugging the game without the benefit of Edu-Ware even owning a printer at the time.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(video_game)#cite_note-ExecEduWare-4)

Both games were well-received critically, earning an "A−" rating in a [1980](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980_in_video_gaming "1980 in video gaming")_Peelings II_ review.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(video_game)#cite_note-PeelingsV1N3-1)

[Bruce Webster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Webster "Bruce Webster") reviewed _Space_ and _Space II_ in _[The Space Gamer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Space\_Gamer "The Space Gamer")_ No. 31.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(video_game)#cite_note-SG-5) Webster commented that "I'm afraid I can't recommend these games in their current condition, at least not at their price. If you've got money and time to burn, though, you might get them and rewrite them yourselves - but do so at your own risk."[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(video_game)#cite_note-SG-5)

[David Mullich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Mullich "David Mullich") created _Space II_, an [expansion pack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansion_pack "Expansion pack"), published in 1979. It was his first game for Edu-Ware. It consists of the character creation module and two additional game scenarios.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(video_game)#cite_note-SpaceIImanual-6) Mullich wrote _Space II_ as an exercise in risk-benefit analysis.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] The character is presented with dangerous options throughout the game, and the player must determine whether the potential rewards are worth the possible risks.

In [1982](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1982_in_video_gaming "1982 in video gaming"), [Game Designers' Workshop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Designers%27_Workshop "Game Designers' Workshop") successfully sued Edu-Ware for copyright infringement of their _[Traveller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traveller\_(role-playing\_game) "Traveller (role-playing game)")_ pen-and-paper role-playing game. In an out of court settlement, Edu-Ware suspended publication of _Space_ and _Space II_, but the company had already replaced both games with the _Empire_ space trilogy, based on an original role-playing game system.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(video_game)#cite_note-TeaLeaves-7)
