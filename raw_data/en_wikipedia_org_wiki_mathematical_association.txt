History [ edit ] It was founded in 1871 as the Association for the Improvement of Geometrical Teaching and renamed to the Mathematical Association in 1897.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] It was the first teachers' subject organisation formed in England. In March 1927, it held a three-day meeting in Grantham to commemorate the bicentenary of the death of Sir Isaac Newton , attended by Sir J. J. Thomson (discoverer of the electron), Sir Frank Watson Dyson – the Astronomer Royal , Sir Horace Lamb , and G. H. Hardy .

In 1951, Mary Cartwright became the first female president of the Mathematical Association.

[ 6 ] In the 1960s, when comprehensive education was being introduced, the Association was in favour of the 11-plus system. For maths teachers training at university, a teaching award that was examined was the Diploma of the Mathematical Association , later known as the Diploma in Mathematical Education of the Mathematical Association.

Function [ edit ] It exists to "bring about improvements in the teaching of mathematics and its applications, and to provide a means of communication among students and teachers of mathematics".

[ 7 ] Since 1894 it has published The Mathematical Gazette . It is one of the participating bodies in the quadrennial British Congress of Mathematics Education, organised by the Joint Mathematical Council , and it holds its annual general meeting as part of the Congress.

[ 8 ] Structure [ edit ] It is based in the south-east of Leicester on London Road ( A6 ), just south of the Charles Frears campus of De Montfort University .

Aside from the council, it has seven other specialist committees.

Regions [ edit ] Its branches are sometimes shared with the Association of Teachers of Mathematics (ATM): Birmingham Cambridge East Midlands Exeter Gloucester Liverpool London Greater Manchester Meridian Stoke and Staffordshire Sheffield Sussex Yorkshire Past presidents [ edit ] Past presidents of The Association for the Improvement of Geometrical Teaching included: 1871 Thomas Archer Hirst 1878 Robert Baldwin Hayward MA, FRS 1889 G M Minchin MA, FRS 1891 James Joseph Sylvester 1892 The Reverend C Taylor DD 1893 R Wormell MA, DSc 1895 Joseph Larmor Past presidents of The Mathematical Association have included: 1897 Alfred Lodge 1899–1900 Robert Stawell Ball [ 9 ] 1901 John Fletcher Moulton, Baron Moulton 1903 Andrew Forsyth [ 10 ] 1905 George Ballard Mathews 1907 George H.
