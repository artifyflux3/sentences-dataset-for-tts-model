[ 1 ] It is operated by the American Chemical Society , Royal Society of Chemistry [ 2 ] and German Chemical Society .

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] The new preprint server was announced already in 2016, [ 5 ] [ 6 ] but was only opened online in 2017.

[ 7 ] Initially, editors of ACS journals were skeptical and only 80% of the editors allowed submissions to be uploaded to the preprint server in 2017.

[ 8 ] In 2019 the Chinese Chemical Society and the Chemical Society of Japan joined as co-owners of the preprint server.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] The initial reception of ChemRxiv was one of hesitation, [ 6 ] with several major journals of the founding organizations initially unsupportive: Angewandte Chemie gave support in March 2018 [ 11 ] and JACS only gave support in August 2018.

[ 12 ] However, ChemRxiv received more than 1,000 submissions in the first eighteen months, [ 13 ] growing to 2,314 in 2019.

[ 10 ] Like other preprint servers, it saw a surge in COVID-19 preprints in 2020.
