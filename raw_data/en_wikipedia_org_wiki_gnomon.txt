The gnomon is the [triangular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular "Triangular") blade in this sundial.

A **gnomon** (; from [Ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_language "Ancient Greek language")[γνώμων](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%B3%CE%BD%CF%8E%CE%BC%CF%89%CE%BD#Ancient_Greek "wikt:γνώμων")_(\_gnṓmōn\_)_'one that knows or examines')[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnomon#cite_note-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnomon#cite_note-2) is the part of a [sundial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundial "Sundial") that casts a [shadow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow "Shadow"). The term is used for a variety of purposes in mathematics and other fields, typically to measure directions, position, or time.

Invariant snail in the subtraction of gnomons (Hero's definition)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnomon#cite_note-3)

A painted stick dating from 2300 BC that was excavated at the archeological site of [Taosi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taosi "Taosi") is the oldest gnomon known in China.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnomon#cite_note-4) The gnomon was widely used in ancient China from the second millennium BC onward in order to determine the changes in seasons, orientation, and geographical latitude. The ancient Chinese used shadow measurements for creating calendars that are mentioned in several ancient texts.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

According to the collection of Zhou Chinese poetic anthologies _[Classic of Poetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic\_of\_Poetry "Classic of Poetry")_, one of the distant ancestors of [King Wen of the Zhou dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Wen_of_Zhou "King Wen of Zhou") used to measure gnomon shadow lengths to determine the orientation around the 14th century BC.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnomon#cite_note-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnomon#cite_note-6) The ancient Greek philosopher [Anaximander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaximander#Gnomon "Anaximander") (610–546 BC) is credited with introducing this [Babylonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonia "Babylonia") instrument to the Ancient Greeks.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnomon#cite_note-7)

The ancient Greek mathematician and astronomer [Oenopides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oenopides#Geometry "Oenopides") used the phrase _drawn gnomon-wise_ to describe a line drawn perpendicular to another.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnomon#cite_note-Heath_78-79-8) Later, the term was used for an **L**-shaped instrument like a [steel square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel_square "Steel square") used to draw right angles. This shape may explain its use to describe a shape formed by cutting a smaller square from a larger one. [Euclid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_Elements "Euclid's Elements") extended the term to the plane figure formed by removing a [similar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Similarity_(geometry) "Similarity (geometry)")[parallelogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallelogram "Parallelogram") from a corner of a larger parallelogram. Indeed, the gnomon is the increment between two successive [figurate numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figurate_number#Gnomon "Figurate number"), including square and triangular numbers.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

### Definition of Hero of Alexandria

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gnomon&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Definition of Hero of Alexandria")]

The ancient Greek mathematician and engineer [Hero of Alexandria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_of_Alexandria "Hero of Alexandria") defined a gnomon as that which, when added or subtracted to an entity (number or shape), makes a new entity similar to the starting entity. In this sense [Theon of Smyrna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theon_of_Smyrna "Theon of Smyrna") used it to describe a number which added to a [polygonal number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygonal_number "Polygonal number") produces the next one of the same type. The most common use in this sense is an odd integer especially when seen as a [figurate number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figurate_number "Figurate number") between [square numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_numbers "Square numbers").[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

[Vitruvius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Vitruvius_Pollio "Marcus Vitruvius Pollio") mentions the gnomon as "_gnonomice_" in the first sentence of chapter 3 in volume 1 of his book _[De Architectura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitruvius#De\_architectura "Vitruvius")_. That Latin term "_gnonomice_" leaves room for interpretation. Despite its similarity to "γνωμονικός" (or its feminine form "γνωμονική"), it appears unlikely that Vitruvius refers to judgement on the one hand or to the design of sundials on the other. It appears to be more appropriate to assume that he refers to geometry, a science upon which gnomons rely heavily. In those days, calculations were carried out geometrically, in contrast to the algebraic methods in use today. Thus, it seems that he indirectly refers to mathematics and [geodesy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesy "Geodesy").[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

The gnomon projection on the floor of the Santa Maria del Fiore Cathedral during the solstice on 21 June 2012

Perforated gnomons projecting a pinhole image of the Sun whose location can be measured to tell the time of day and year were described in the Chinese _[Zhoubi Suanjing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhoubi\_Suanjing "Zhoubi Suanjing")_, possibly dating as early as the early [Zhou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhou_dynasty "Zhou dynasty") (11th century BC) but surviving only in forms dating to the [Eastern Han](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Han_dynasty "Eastern Han dynasty") (3rd century).[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnomon#cite_note-9)

In the Middle East and Europe, it was separately credited to the Egyptian astronomer and mathematician [Ibn Yunus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Yunus "Ibn Yunus") around AD 1000.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnomon#cite_note-10) The Italian astronomer, mathematician and cosmographer [Paolo Toscanelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paolo_Toscanelli "Paolo Toscanelli") is associated with the 1475 placement of a bronze plate with a round hole in the dome of the Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore in Florence to project an image of the Sun on the cathedral's floor. With markings on the floor it tells the exact time of each midday (reportedly to within half a second) as well as the date of the summer solstice. Italian mathematician, engineer, astronomer and geographer [Leonardo Ximenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_Ximenes "Leonardo Ximenes") reconstructed the gnomon according to his new measurements in 1756.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnomon#cite_note-11)

Gnomon situated on the wall of a building facing Tiradentes Square, [Curitiba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curitiba "Curitiba"), Brazil

In the [Northern Hemisphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Hemisphere "Northern Hemisphere"), the shadow-casting edge of a sundial gnomon is normally oriented so that it points due [northward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_north "True north") and is [parallel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_(geometry) "Parallel (geometry)") to the rotational axis of [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth"). That is, it is [inclined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_alignment "Polar alignment") to the northern horizon at an [angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle "Angle") that equals the [latitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude "Latitude") of the sundial's location. At present, such a gnomon should thus point almost precisely at [Polaris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polaris "Polaris"), as this is within 1° of the north [celestial pole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_pole "Celestial pole").

On some sundials, the gnomon is vertical. These were usually used in former times for observing the [altitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altitude "Altitude") of the [Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun "Sun"), especially when on the [meridian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meridian_(geography) "Meridian (geography)").

The _style_ is the part of the gnomon that casts the shadow. This can change as the Sun moves. For example, the upper west edge of the gnomon might be the style in the morning and the upper east edge might be the style in the afternoon.

Gnomons have been used in space missions to the Moon and Mars. The gnomon used by the [Apollo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_program "Apollo program") astronauts was a gimballed stadia rod mounted on a tripod. While the rod's shadow indicated the direction of the Sun, the grayscale paints of varying reflectivity and the red, green and blue patches facilitated proper photography on the surface on the Moon.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnomon#cite_note-12)[MarsDials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MarsDial "MarsDial") have been used on [Mars Exploration Rovers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Exploration_Rover "Mars Exploration Rover").

A gnomon in computer graphics

A three-dimensional gnomon is commonly used in [CAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_design "Computer-aided design") and [computer graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_graphics "Computer graphics") as an aid to positioning objects in the [virtual world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_world "Virtual world"). By convention, the _x_-axis direction is colored red, the _y_-axis green and the _z_-axis blue.
