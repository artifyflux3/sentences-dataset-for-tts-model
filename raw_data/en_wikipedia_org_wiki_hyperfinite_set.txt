An internal set H of internal cardinality g ∈ * N (the hypernaturals ) is hyperfinite if and only if there exists an internal bijection between G = {1,2,3,..., g } and H .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Hyperfinite sets share the properties of finite sets: A hyperfinite set has minimal and maximal elements, and a hyperfinite union of a hyperfinite collection of hyperfinite sets may be derived. The sum of the elements of any hyperfinite subset of * R always exists, leading to the possibility of well-defined integration .

[ 2 ] Hyperfinite sets can be used to approximate other sets. If a hyperfinite set approximates an interval, it is called a near interval with respect to that interval. Consider a hyperfinite set K = { k 1 , k 2 , … … , k n } {\displaystyle K=\{k_{1},k_{2},\dots ,k_{n}\}} with a hypernatural n .

K is a near interval for [ a , b ] if k 1 = a and k n = b , and if the difference between successive elements of K is infinitesimal . Phrased otherwise, the requirement is that for every r ∈ [ a , b ] there is a k i ∈ K such that k i ≈ r . This, for example, allows for an approximation to the unit circle , considered as the set e i θ θ {\displaystyle e^{i\theta }} for θ in the interval [0,2π].

[ 2 ] In general, subsets of hyperfinite sets are not hyperfinite, often because they do not contain the extreme elements of the parent set.

[ 3 ] Ultrapower construction [ edit ] In terms of the ultrapower construction, the hyperreal line * R is defined as the collection of equivalence classes of sequences ⟨ ⟨ u n , n = 1 , 2 , … … ⟩ ⟩ {\displaystyle \langle u_{n},n=1,2,\ldots \rangle } of real numbers u n .  Namely, the equivalence class defines a hyperreal, denoted [ u n ] {\displaystyle [u_{n}]} in Goldblatt's notation.  Similarly, an arbitrary hyperfinite set in * R is of the form [ A n ] {\displaystyle [A_{n}]} , and is defined by a sequence ⟨ ⟨ A n ⟩ ⟩ {\displaystyle \langle A_{n}\rangle } of finite sets A n ⊆ ⊆ R , n = 1 , 2 , … … {\displaystyle A_{n}\subseteq \mathbb {R} ,n=1,2,\ldots } [ 4 ] References [ edit ] ^ J.
