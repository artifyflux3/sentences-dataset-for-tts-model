It expresses the total probability of an outcome which can be realized via several distinct events , hence the name.

Statement [ edit ] The law of total probability is [ 1 ] a theorem that states, in its discrete case, if { B n : n = 1 , 2 , 3 , … … } {\displaystyle \left\{{B_{n}:n=1,2,3,\ldots }\right\}} is a finite or countably infinite set of mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive events, then for any event A {\displaystyle A} P ( A ) = ∑ ∑ n P ( A ∩ ∩ B n ) {\displaystyle P(A)=\sum _{n}P(A\cap B_{n})} or, alternatively, [ 1 ] P ( A ) = ∑ ∑ n P ( A ∣ ∣ B n ) P ( B n ) , {\displaystyle P(A)=\sum _{n}P(A\mid B_{n})P(B_{n}),} where, for any n {\displaystyle n} , if P ( B n ) = 0 {\displaystyle P(B_{n})=0} , then these terms are simply omitted from the summation since P ( A ∣ ∣ B n ) {\displaystyle P(A\mid B_{n})} is finite.

The summation can be interpreted as a weighted average , and consequently the marginal probability, P ( A ) {\displaystyle P(A)} , is sometimes called "average probability"; [ 2 ] "overall probability" is sometimes used in less formal writings.

[ 3 ] The law of total probability can also be stated for conditional probabilities: P ( A | C ) = P ( A , C ) P ( C ) = ∑ ∑ n P ( A , B n , C ) P ( C ) = ∑ ∑ n P ( A ∣ ∣ B n , C ) P ( B n ∣ ∣ C ) P ( C ) P ( C ) = ∑ ∑ n P ( A ∣ ∣ B n , C ) P ( B n ∣ ∣ C ) {\displaystyle P({A|C})={\frac {P({A,C})}{P(C)}}={\frac {\sum \limits _{n}{P({A,{B_{n}},C})}}{P(C)}}={\frac {\sum \limits _{n}P({A\mid {B_{n}},C})P({{B_{n}}\mid C})P(C)}{P(C)}}=\sum \limits _{n}P({A\mid {B_{n}},C})P({{B_{n}}\mid C})} Taking the B n {\displaystyle B_{n}} as above, and assuming C {\displaystyle C} is an event independent of any of the B n {\displaystyle B_{n}} : P ( A ∣ ∣ C ) = ∑ ∑ n P ( A ∣ ∣ C , B n ) P ( B n ) {\displaystyle P(A\mid C)=\sum _{n}P(A\mid C,B_{n})P(B_{n})} Continuous case [ edit ] The law of total probability extends to the case of conditioning on events generated by continuous random variables. Let ( Ω Ω , F , P ) {\displaystyle (\Omega ,{\mathcal {F}},P)} be a probability space . Suppose X {\displaystyle X} is a random variable with distribution function F X {\displaystyle F_{X}} , and A {\displaystyle A} an event on ( Ω Ω , F , P ) {\displaystyle (\Omega ,{\mathcal {F}},P)} . Then the law of total probability states P ( A ) = ∫ ∫ − − ∞ ∞ ∞ ∞ P ( A | X = x ) d F X ( x ) .

{\displaystyle P(A)=\int _{-\infty }^{\infty }P(A|X=x)dF_{X}(x).} If X {\displaystyle X} admits a density function f X {\displaystyle f_{X}} , then the result is P ( A ) = ∫ ∫ − − ∞ ∞ ∞ ∞ P ( A | X = x ) f X ( x ) d x .

{\displaystyle P(A)=\int _{-\infty }^{\infty }P(A|X=x)f_{X}(x)dx.} Moreover, for the specific case where A = { Y ∈ ∈ B } {\displaystyle A=\{Y\in B\}} , where B {\displaystyle B} is a Borel set, then this yields P ( Y ∈ ∈ B ) = ∫ ∫ − − ∞ ∞ ∞ ∞ P ( Y ∈ ∈ B | X = x ) f X ( x ) d x .

{\displaystyle P(Y\in B)=\int _{-\infty }^{\infty }P(Y\in B|X=x)f_{X}(x)dx.} Example [ edit ] Suppose that two factories supply light bulbs to the market. Factory X 's bulbs work for over 5000 hours in 99% of cases, whereas factory Y 's bulbs work for over 5000 hours in 95% of cases. It is known that factory X supplies 60% of the total bulbs available and Y supplies 40% of the total bulbs available. What is the chance that a purchased bulb will work for longer than 5000 hours?

Applying the law of total probability, we have: P ( A ) = P ( A ∣ ∣ B X ) ⋅ ⋅ P ( B X ) + P ( A ∣ ∣ B Y ) ⋅ ⋅ P ( B Y ) = 99 100 ⋅ ⋅ 6 10 + 95 100 ⋅ ⋅ 4 10 = 594 + 380 1000 = 974 1000 {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}P(A)&=P(A\mid B_{X})\cdot P(B_{X})+P(A\mid B_{Y})\cdot P(B_{Y})\\[4pt]&={99 \over 100}\cdot {6 \over 10}+{95 \over 100}\cdot {4 \over 10}={{594+380} \over 1000}={974 \over 1000}\end{aligned}}} where P ( B X ) = 6 10 {\displaystyle P(B_{X})={6 \over 10}} is the probability that the purchased bulb was manufactured by factory X ; P ( B Y ) = 4 10 {\displaystyle P(B_{Y})={4 \over 10}} is the probability that the purchased bulb was manufactured by factory Y ; P ( A ∣ ∣ B X ) = 99 100 {\displaystyle P(A\mid B_{X})={99 \over 100}} is the probability that a bulb manufactured by X will work for over 5000 hours; P ( A ∣ ∣ B Y ) = 95 100 {\displaystyle P(A\mid B_{Y})={95 \over 100}} is the probability that a bulb manufactured by Y will work for over 5000 hours.

Thus each purchased light bulb has a 97.4% chance to work for more than 5000 hours.

Other names [ edit ] The term law of total probability is sometimes taken to mean the law of alternatives , which is a special case of the law of total probability applying to discrete random variables .

[ citation needed ] One author uses the terminology of the "Rule of Average Conditional Probabilities", [ 4 ] while another refers to it as the "continuous law of alternatives" in the continuous case.

[ 5 ] This result is given by Grimmett and Welsh [ 6 ] as the partition theorem , a name that they also give to the related law of total expectation .
