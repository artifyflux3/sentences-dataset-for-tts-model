The Moscow school ( Russian : Московская школа , romanized : Moskovskaya shkola ) is the name applied to a Russian architectural and painting school in the 14th to 16th centuries.

[ 1 ] It developed during the strengthening of the Moscow principality.

[ 1 ] The buildings of Vladimir provided the basis of the Moscow architectural school, which preserved elements of the synthesis of the Byzantine and Romanesque styles.

[ 2 ] Architecture [ edit ] See also: Russian architecture Early architecture [ edit ] In Vladimir and other older cities like Rostov and Suzdal , restoration efforts took place during the 13th century, rather than new architectural development.

[ 3 ] Vladimir never regained its former glory and only retained its formal status as the capital of the grand principality.

[ 3 ] By the end of the 13th century, there was a resurgence in the building of new churches in areas where political consolidation was taking place.

[ 4 ] The princes of Moscow and Tver fought for supremacy, which continued into the early 14th century.

[ 3 ] Tver was in the ascendant at first, with masonry building being revived in Tver nearly half a century before Moscow.

[ 3 ] The foundations of the first stone church in Moscow were laid on 4 August 1326 during the reign of Ivan I after the seat of the Russian metropolitan was moved to Moscow.

[ 3 ] The chronicler records: the foundations of the first stone church in Moscow were laid in the square in the name of the Dormition [...] of the Holy Mother of God by the Most Reverend Metropolitan Pyotr and the Most Noble Prince Ivan Kalita.

[ 5 ] Masonry building continued in the following years with the Dormition Cathedral being completed in 1327.

[ 4 ] This was followed by the Belfry of Saint John Climacus (1329) and the Cathedral of the Savior on the Bor (1330).

[ 6 ] Finally, the Cathedral of the Archangel was completed in 1333.

[ 1 ] The white-stone walls and towers of the Kremlin were built in 1366–1368.

[ 1 ] By the late 14th century, the Muscovite type of white-stone church emerged, being compact and having four pillars, heightened ribbed arches, tiers of kokoshniks , and carved decorative belts on the facades.

[ 7 ] This was a modification of the traditions of the Vladimir-Suzdal school .

[ 7 ] The Nativity Church in the Kremlin (1393–1394) is the oldest surviving monument in the Kremlin.

[ 7 ] The Moscow architectural school, which extended to the smaller principalities that were incorporated, evolved steadily throughout the 15th century.

[ 5 ] In smaller towns, a more distinct type of church emerged, one that returned to the Vladimir school.

[ 5 ] A group of cathedrals built at the end of the 14th century and the beginning of the 15th century exemplifies the "early Moscow style" that preceded the arrival of Renaissance craftsmen.

[ 8 ] These include the Cathedral of the Dormition in Zvenigorod (1396–1398), the Cathedral of the Nativity of the Virgin in the Savvino-Storozhevsky Monastery (1405–1408), and the Cathedral of the Trinity in the Trinity Lavra of St. Sergius ( c.

1422 ).

[ 8 ] Scholars of Moscow's architectural history have emphasized that the traditions of a number of Russian principalities were integrated into a unified system in the early 15th century.

[ 9 ] The Cathedral of the Savior in the Andronikov Monastery (1425–1427) is often cited as the main example of this.

[ 10 ] Renaissance [ edit ] The late 15th century marked a significant period for masonry architecture, with many new masonry buildings appearing in the Moscow Kremlin and in other parts of Moscow.

[ 11 ] Eight new churches were built within the Kremlin itself.

[ 11 ] Brick began to replace the previously used limestone ("white stone"), likely under the influence of brick architecture in northern Germany's coastal towns, with which Novgorod had trade connections.

[ 11 ] It is believed that that a group of Novgorodian masters worked in Moscow and introduced new techniques.

[ 11 ] Following the end of Mongol suzerainty, Ivan III transformed Russian architectural style after contacts with Italian cities were restored, introducing new features that were preserved throughout the following centuries.

[ 12 ] Italian Renaissance masters worked in Russia from 1475 to 1539.

[ 13 ] The career of Aristotele Fioravanti is considered to be evidence that Moscow attracted leading Italian masters.

[ 14 ] The Dormition Cathedral in the Kremlin (1475–1479) reflects the spirit of early Vladimir and Fioravanti used the Dormition Cathedral in Vladimir, a symbol of the center of the Russian Church, as his model while introducing new influences at the same time.

1422 Cathedral of the Savior in the Andronikov Monastery , 1425–1427 Cathedral of the Archangel in the Moscow Kremlin , 1505–1508 Painting [ edit ] See also: Russian icons The basis of the Moscow school of painting was the synthesis of local traditions with Byzantine and South Slavic art.

[ 7 ] From the mid-14th century, two stylistic lines appeared: one associated with monastic art and the other with large-scale depictions.

[ 7 ] The flourishing of the Moscow school in the late 14th and early 15th centuries is associated with Theophanes the Greek , Andrei Rublev and Daniel Chorny .

[ 7 ] Andrei Rublev led the school in the early 15th century and became one of the most celebrated Russian icon painters.

[ 16 ] Rublev's traditions were continued by Dionisius in the late 15th and early 16th centuries.

[ 7 ] His icons and frescoes were known for their refined proportions, decorative festive coloring, and harmonious composition.

[ 7 ] The achievements of the Moscow school significantly influenced the development of the all-Russian style in the 16th century.
