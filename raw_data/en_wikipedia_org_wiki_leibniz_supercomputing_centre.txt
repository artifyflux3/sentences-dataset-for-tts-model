Among other IT services, it provides supercomputer resources for research and access to the Munich Scientific Network [ de ] (MWN); it is connected to the Deutsches Forschungsnetz with a 24 Gbit/s link.

The centre is named after Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz . It was founded in 1962 by Hans Piloty and Robert Sauer as part of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities and the host for several world leading supercomputers (HLRB, HLRB-II, SuperMUC).

SuperMUC [ edit ] Main article: SuperMUC The Leibniz Supercomputing Centre operated SuperMUC , which was the fastest European supercomputer when it entered operation in 2012 and was ranked #9 in the TOP500 list of the world's fastest supercomputers.
