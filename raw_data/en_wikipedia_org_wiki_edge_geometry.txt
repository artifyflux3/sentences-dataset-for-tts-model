Three edges AB, BC, and CA, each between two vertices of a triangle .

A polygon is bounded by edges; this square has 4 edges.

Every edge is shared by two faces in a polyhedron , like this cube .

Every edge is shared by three or more faces in a 4-polytope , as seen in this projection of a tesseract .

In geometry , an edge is a particular type of line segment joining two vertices in a polygon , polyhedron , or higher-dimensional polytope .

[ 1 ] In a polygon, an edge is a line segment on the boundary, [ 2 ] and is often called a polygon side . In a polyhedron or more generally a polytope, an edge is a line segment where two faces (or polyhedron sides) meet.

[ 3 ] A segment joining two vertices while passing through the interior or exterior is not an edge but instead is called a diagonal .

An edge may also be an infinite line separating two half-planes .

[ 4 ] The sides of a plane angle are semi-infinite half-lines (or rays).

[ 5 ] Relation to edges in graphs [ edit ] In graph theory , an edge is an abstract object connecting two graph vertices , unlike polygon and polyhedron edges which have a concrete geometric representation as a line segment.
However, any polyhedron can be represented by its skeleton or edge-skeleton, a graph whose vertices are the geometric vertices of the polyhedron and whose edges correspond to the geometric edges.

[ 6 ] Conversely, the graphs that are skeletons of three-dimensional polyhedra can be characterized by Steinitz's theorem as being exactly the 3-vertex-connected planar graphs .

[ 7 ] Number of edges in a polyhedron [ edit ] Any convex polyhedron 's surface has Euler characteristic V − − E + F = 2 , {\displaystyle V-E+F=2,} where V is the number of vertices , E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces . This equation is known as Euler's polyhedron formula . Thus the number of edges is 2 less than the sum of the numbers of vertices and faces. For example, a cube has 8 vertices and 6 faces, and hence 12 edges.

Incidences with other faces [ edit ] In a polygon, two edges meet at each vertex ; more generally, by Balinski's theorem , at least d edges meet at every vertex of a d -dimensional convex polytope.

[ 8 ] Similarly, in a polyhedron, exactly two two-dimensional faces meet at every edge, [ 9 ] while in higher dimensional polytopes three or more two-dimensional faces meet at every edge.

Alternative terminology [ edit ] In the theory of high-dimensional convex polytopes , a facet or side of a d -dimensional polytope is one of its ( d − 1)-dimensional features, a ridge is a ( d − 2)-dimensional feature, and a peak is a ( d − 3)-dimensional feature. Thus, the edges of a polygon are its facets, the edges of a 3-dimensional convex polyhedron are its ridges, and the edges of a 4-dimensional polytope are its peaks.
