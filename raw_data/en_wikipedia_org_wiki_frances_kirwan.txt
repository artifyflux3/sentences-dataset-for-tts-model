Her fields of specialisation are algebraic and symplectic geometry .

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] Education [ edit ] Kirwan was educated at Oxford High School , and studied maths as an undergraduate at Clare College in the University of Cambridge .

[ 5 ] She took a D.Phil at Oxford in 1984, with the dissertation title The Cohomology of Quotients in Symplectic and Algebraic Geometry , which was supervised by Michael Atiyah .

[ 6 ] Research [ edit ] Kirwan's research interests include moduli spaces in algebraic geometry , geometric invariant theory (GIT), and in the link between GIT and moment maps in symplectic geometry .

[ 7 ] Her work endeavours to understand the structure of geometric objects by investigation of their algebraic and topological properties.

[ 8 ] She introduced the Kirwan map .

From 1983 to 1985 she held a junior fellowship at Harvard . From 1983 to 1986 she held a Fellowship at Magdalen College, Oxford , before becoming a Fellow of Balliol College, Oxford .

[ 9 ] She is an honorary fellow of Clare College, Cambridge [ 10 ] and also at Magdalen College.

[ 11 ] In 1996, she was awarded the Title of Distinction of Professor of Mathematics. From 2004 to 2006 she was president of the London Mathematical Society , the second-youngest president in the society's history and only the second woman to be president.

[ 12 ] [ 13 ] In 2005, she received a five-year EPSRC Senior Research Fellowship, to support her research on the moduli spaces of complex algebraic curves .

[ 14 ] In 2017, she was elected Savilian Professor of Geometry , becoming the first woman to hold the post.

[ 15 ] While this entailed a move to New College, Oxford she was elected an emeritus fellow at Balliol.

[ 16 ] She was the convenor of the 2008–9 meeting of European Women in Mathematics and deputy convenor of the following meeting in 2010–11.

[ 17 ] Prizes, awards and scholarships [ edit ] London Mathematical Society Whitehead Prize , 1989 [ 18 ] Fellow of the Royal Society , 2001 [ 19 ] President, London Mathematical Society , 2003–2005 EPSRC Senior Research Fellowship, 2005–2010, for her work in algebraic geometry [ 20 ] Fellow of the American Mathematical Society , 2012 [ 21 ] London Mathematical Society Senior Whitehead Prize, 2013 [ 18 ] DBE for services to mathematics, 2014 [ 22 ] Maths and Computing Suffrage Science award , 2016 [ 23 ] Member of Academia Europaea [ 9 ] Chairman of the United Kingdom Mathematics Trust Sylvester Medal of The Royal Society, 2021 Honorary degree, University of York , 2020 [ 24 ] Honorary degree, University of St Andrews , 2022 [ 25 ] L'Oréal-UNESCO For Women in Science Awards (Laureate for Europe – Mathematics), 2023 [ 26 ] Kirwan served on the medal-selection committee that awarded the Fields medal to Maryam Mirzakhani .
