Saying … you said to me, your son, “you shall bring me some quails that I may eat them” and I, your son, then brought you seven quails and you ate them …, Quails were mentioned in all three Abrahamic religions in the Old Testament. It was mentioned several times, for example: in Exodus (16:13-15) “That evening quail came and covered the camp, and in the morning, there was a layer of dew around the camp. When the dew was gone, thin flakes like frost on the ground appeared on the desert floor. When the Israelites saw it, they said to each other, “What is it?” For they did not know what it was. Moses said to them, “It is the bread the Lord has given you to eat” Psalm (78:30-31) mentioned 
that many Israelites died after eating quail mentioning “But before they turned from what 
they craved, even while the food was still in their mouths, God’s anger rose against them; he 
put to death the sturdiest among them” In the Quran in surah taha verse 80 “ O Children of Israel! We saved you from your enemy, and made an appointment with you on the right side of Mount Ṭûr, and sent down to you manna and quails” [ 6 ] In Author Naguib Mahfouz 's novel Autumn Quail the quail is used as an allegory for the fleeting happiness of the protagonist The neighbourhood near the Giza pyramid complex that includes the horse stables and tourist gift shops is called "Nazlet el Semman" which means "Quails landing" it got that name because quail birds would descend to the area during their seasonal migration [ 7 ] [ 8 ] Quail in cookery [ edit ] Main article: Quail as food Quail that have fed on hemlock (e.g., during migration) may induce acute kidney injury due to accumulation of toxic substances from the hemlock in the meat; this problem is referred to as " coturnism ".
