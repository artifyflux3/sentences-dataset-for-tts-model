The moments of inertia of a mass have units of dimension ML 2 ([mass] × [length] 2 ). It should not be confused with the second moment of area , which has units of dimension L 4 ([length] 4 ) and is used in beam calculations. The mass moment of inertia is often also known as the rotational inertia or sometimes as the angular mass .

For simple objects with geometric symmetry, one can often determine the moment of inertia in an exact closed-form expression . Typically this occurs when the mass density is constant, but in some cases, the density can vary throughout the object as well. In general, it may not be straightforward to symbolically express the moment of inertia of shapes with more complicated mass distributions and lacking symmetry. In calculating moments of inertia, it is useful to remember that it is an additive function and exploit the parallel axis and the perpendicular axis theorems.

This article considers mainly symmetric mass distributions, with constant density throughout the object, and the axis of rotation is taken to be through the center of mass unless otherwise specified.

Moments of inertia [ edit ] Following are scalar moments of inertia. In general, the moment of inertia is a tensor : see below.

Description Figure Moment(s) of inertia Notes Point mass M at a distance r from the axis of rotation.

I = M r 2 {\displaystyle I=Mr^{2}} A point mass does not have a moment of inertia around its own axis, but using the parallel axis theorem a moment of inertia around a distant axis of rotation is achieved.
