View a machine-translated version of the German article.

Machine translation, like DeepL or Google Translate , is a useful starting point for translations, but translators must revise errors as necessary and confirm that the translation is accurate, rather than simply copy-pasting machine-translated text into the English Wikipedia.

Consider adding a topic to this template: there are already 1,945 articles in the main category , and specifying |topic= will aid in categorization.

Do not translate text that appears unreliable or low-quality. If possible, verify the text with references provided in the foreign-language article.

You must provide copyright attribution in the edit summary accompanying your translation by providing an interlanguage link to the source of your translation. A model attribution edit summary is Content in this edit is translated from the existing German Wikipedia article at [[:de:VD 17]]; see its history for attribution.

You may also add the template {{Translated|de|VD 17}} to the talk page .

The Verzeichnis der im deutschen Sprachraum erschienenen Drucke des 17. Jahrhunderts (in English: Bibliography of Books Printed in the German Speaking Countries from 1601 to 1700 ), abbreviated VD17 , is a project to make a retrospective German national bibliography for the 17th century. The project was initiated in 1996 and planned to continue for 10–12 years. It is financed by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Research Foundation). As of early 2007, the database contains more than 250,000 titles.

There is a corresponding German national bibliography for the 16th century, known as VD 16 , which was compiled during the period 1969-1999, and another for the 18th century is planned.
