There are over 100 topics all named after this German mathematician and scientist, all in the fields of mathematics, physics, and astronomy. The English eponymous adjective Gaussian is pronounced / ˈ ɡ aʊ s i ən / .

A dormitory building is named after him in University of California, Santa Cruz, in Crown College Monuments, busts, and memorial plaques [ edit ] Gauss Monuments were erected in Brunswick and Göttingen (the last together with Weber).

Busts of Gauss were placed in the Walhalla hall of fame near Regensburg and in the German Research Centre for Geosciences in Potsdam . Several places where Gauss has stayed in Germany are marked with plaques.
