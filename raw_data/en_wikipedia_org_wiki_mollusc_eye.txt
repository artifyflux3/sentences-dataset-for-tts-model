Cephalopods such as octopus , squid , and cuttlefish have eyes as complex as those of vertebrates, while scallops have up to 100 simple eyes .

[ 2 ] Diversity [ edit ] There are between seven and eleven distinct eye types in molluscs.

[ 3 ] Molluscs have eyes of all levels of complexity, from the pit eyes of many gastropods , to the pinhole eyes of the Nautilus , to the lensed eyes of the other cephalopods .  Compound eyes are present in some bivalves, and reflective 'mirrors' have been innovated by other lineages such as scallops .

[ 1 ] As well as varying in complexity, the eyes of molluscs span a huge range in size; they may be from 20 μm (0.0008 in) to 27 cm (11 in) across.

[ 1 ] Anatomy [ edit ] Gastropods and cephalopods have paired eyes on their heads (and sometimes tails), [ 1 ] but many molluscs do not have clear head regions in which to locate the eyes. Consequently, many molluscs may have a multitude of eyes in more unlikely places, such as along the edge of their shell.

[ 1 ] Chitons have a dispersed network of tiny eyes over the surface of their shells which may act together as a compound eye.

[ 1 ] Many gastropods have stalked eyes; the eye can be retracted into the stalk itself in the presence of danger.
