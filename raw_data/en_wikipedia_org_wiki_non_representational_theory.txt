( April 2023 ) Non-representational theory is a form of theory developed in human geography . It is the work of Nigel Thrift .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] The theory is based on using social theory , conducting geographical research, and the 'embodied experience.' [ 3 ] Definition [ edit ] Instead of studying and representing social relationships, non-representational theory focuses upon practices – how human and nonhuman formations are enacted or performed – not simply on what is produced.

[ 4 ] "First, it valorizes those processes  that operate before … conscious, reflective thought … [and] second, it insists on the  necessity of not prioritizing representations  as the primary epistemological vehicles through which knowledge is extracted from the world".

[ 5 ] Recent studies have examined a wide range of activities including dance, [ 4 ] [ 6 ] musical performance, [ 7 ] walking, [ 8 ] gardening, [ 9 ] rave, [ 10 ] listening to music [ 11 ] and children's play.

[ 12 ] Post-structuralist origins [ edit ] This is a post-structuralist theory inspired in part by the ideas of the physicist - philosopher Niels Bohr , [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] and thinkers such as Michel Foucault , Gilles Deleuze , Félix Guattari , Bruno Latour , Michel Serres and Karen Barad , and by phenomenonologists such as Martin Heidegger and Maurice Merleau-Ponty .

[ 16 ] More recently it considers views from political science (including ideas about radical democracy ) and anthropological discussions of the material dimensions of human life.

[ citation needed ] It parallels the conception of "hybrid geographies" developed by Sarah Whatmore .

[ 17 ] Criticism [ edit ] Critics have suggested that Thrift's use of the term "non-representational theory" is problematic, and that other non-representational theories could be developed.

Richard G. Smith said that Baudrillard 's work could be considered a "non-representational theory", for example, [ 16 ] which has fostered some debate.

[ citation needed ] In 2005, Hayden Lorimer (Glasgow University) said that the term "more-than-representational" was preferable.
