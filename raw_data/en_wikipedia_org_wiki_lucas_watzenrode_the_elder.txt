In 1436, he married Katharina von Rüdiger. In 1448, he and other Thorn burghers are registered as having been summoned to the court at Limburg .

Lucas and his wife Katharina had a daughter, Barbara, who married Nicolas Kopernik. Barbara's sister Christina married Tideman von Allen. Both sisters married in Thorn.

Lucas Watzenrode the Elder's grandson became known as Nicolaus Copernicus . Copernicus had an uncle, his mother's brother, also named Lucas Watzenrode (known as Lucas Watzenrode the Younger), who as Bishop of Ermland strongly supported the independence of Ermland and helped raise Nicolaus and his brother Andreas after their father's death.
