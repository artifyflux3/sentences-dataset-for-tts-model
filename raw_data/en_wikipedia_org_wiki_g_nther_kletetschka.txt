He is a Senior Research Professor at the Geophysical Institute of the University of Alaska Fairbanks and an Assistant Professor at the Institute of Hydrogeology of Charles University in Prague , Czech Republic .

In November 2024, Dr. Kletetschka propounded that time exists in three dimensions , and that our three spatial dimensions emerge from those three temporal dimensions , thus creating our universe of six-dimensions with matter , energy , and their fundamental interactions .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] The Kletetschka mathematical framework provides a possible way to reconcile the quantum physics of subatomic particles , the Newtonian physics of our everyday lives, and the relativistic physics of the cosmos .

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] Early life and career [ edit ] Kletetschka was born in Litoměřice , Czechoslovakia , in 1964. In 1989, he received the Bc degree in geophysics from Charles University in Prague, Czechoslovakia. During his studies from 1987 to 1991, he worked as a research and teaching assistant. Immigrating to the United States in 1991, Kletetschka received the MS degree in 1994 and the PhD degree in geology and geophysics in 1998 from the University of Minnesota . During his studies from 1991 to 1998, he served as a teaching and research assistant.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] Following his doctoral studies, Kletetschka pursued a wide variety of activities around the world in climate science , geophysics, hydrogeology , aerospace engineering , magnetics , astrophysics, and medical research . From 1998 to 2000, he was named a National Research Council Postdoctoral Research Associate. Kletetschka served as a contractor for the Goddard Space Flight Center Laboratory of Terrestrial Physics from 1998 to 2002, and the Laboratory of Extraterrestrial Physics until 2004. From 2000 to 2002, he served as a Research Associate at the Catholic University of America . In 2002, Kletetschka was a Lecturer at Montgomery College , and from 2002 to 2003, he served as a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Howard University .

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] From 2003 to 2023, Kletetschka was named a Researcher at the Institute of Geology of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic . In 2023, he was also named a Research Scholar at the University of Delaware Bartol Research Institute . From 2003 to 2011, Kletetschka was appointed a Research Professor at the Catholic University of America Institute of Astrophysics and Computational Sciences. From 2005 to 2011, he served as a contractor for the Goddard Space Flight Center Solar System Exploration team. From 2011 to 2015, Kletetschka was a Guest Researcher for the National Institute of Standards and Technology Magnetic group in Gaithersburg, Maryland . From 2013 to 2015, he was a Guest Researcher at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory Nuclear Science group in Berkeley, California .

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 10 ] In June 2011, Kletetschka was appointed Research Scientist at the Charles University Institute of Hydrogeology, a position he continues to hold. In August 2016, he was appointed Associate Research Professor at the Geophysical Institute of the University of Alaska Fairbanks.

[ 5 ] [ 7 ] [ 10 ] Dr. Kleteschka is widely published.

[ 7 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] Six-dimensional universe [ edit ] In November 2024, Dr. Kletetschka propounded his six-dimensional universe of three temporal dimensions and three spatial dimensions in a paper entitled Three-Dimensional Time: A Mathematical Framework for Fundamental Physics .

[ 1 ] Kletetschka proposed numerous experiments to test his mathematical framework.

[ 1 ] Although other scientists had previously proposed six-dimensional universes , Kletetschka's mathematical framework maintains causality , accurately calculates fermion masses, and makes specific predictions for the discovery of quantum gravity .

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] In March 2025, Kletetschka further propounded that electrical charge is a topological property of three-dimensional time in a paper entitled Charge as a Topological Property in Three-Dimensional Time .

[ 2 ] This paper further elaborates on three-dimensional time and electromagnetic fields .
