In geometry , a hyperplane is a generalization of a two-dimensional plane in three-dimensional space to mathematical spaces of arbitrary dimension . Like a plane in space , a hyperplane is a flat hypersurface , a subspace whose dimension is one less than that of the ambient space . Two lower-dimensional examples of hyperplanes are one-dimensional lines in a plane and zero-dimensional points on a line.

Most commonly, the ambient space is n -dimensional Euclidean space , in which case the hyperplanes are the ( n − 1) -dimensional "flats" , each of which separates the space into two half spaces .

[ 1 ] A reflection across a hyperplane is a kind of motion ( geometric transformation preserving distance between points), and the group of all motions is generated by the reflections. A convex polytope is the intersection of half-spaces.

In non-Euclidean geometry , the ambient space might be the n -dimensional sphere or hyperbolic space , or more generally a pseudo-Riemannian space form , and the hyperplanes are the hypersurfaces consisting of all geodesics through a point which are perpendicular to a specific normal geodesic.

In other kinds of ambient spaces, some properties from Euclidean space are no longer relevant. For example, in affine space , there is no concept of distance, so there are no reflections or motions. In a non-orientable space such as elliptic space or projective space , there is no concept of half-planes. In greatest generality, the notion of hyperplane is meaningful in any mathematical space in which the concept of the dimension of a subspace is defined.

The difference in dimension between a subspace and its ambient space is known as its codimension . A hyperplane has codimension 1 .

Technical description [ edit ] In geometry , a hyperplane of an n -dimensional space V is a subspace of dimension n − 1, or equivalently, of codimension 1 in V . The space V may be a Euclidean space or more generally an affine space , or a vector space or a projective space , and the notion of hyperplane varies correspondingly since the definition of subspace differs in these settings; in all cases however, any hyperplane can be given in coordinates as the solution of a single (due to the "codimension 1" constraint) algebraic equation of degree 1.

If V is a vector space, one distinguishes "vector hyperplanes" (which are linear subspaces , and therefore must pass through the origin) and "affine hyperplanes" (which need not pass through the origin; they can be obtained by translation of a vector hyperplane). A hyperplane in a Euclidean space separates that space into two half spaces , and defines a reflection that fixes the hyperplane and interchanges those two half spaces.

Special types of hyperplanes [ edit ] Several specific types of hyperplanes are defined with properties that are well suited for particular purposes. Some of these specializations are described here.

Affine hyperplanes [ edit ] An affine hyperplane is  an affine subspace of codimension 1 in an affine space .
In Cartesian coordinates , such a hyperplane can be described with a single linear equation of the following form (where at least one of the a i {\displaystyle a_{i}} s is non-zero and b {\displaystyle b} is an arbitrary constant): a 1 x 1 + a 2 x 2 + ⋯ ⋯ + a n x n = b .

{\displaystyle a_{1}x_{1}+a_{2}x_{2}+\cdots +a_{n}x_{n}=b.\ } In the case of a real affine space, in other words when the coordinates are real numbers, this affine space separates the space into two half-spaces, which are the connected components of the complement of the hyperplane, and are given by the inequalities a 1 x 1 + a 2 x 2 + ⋯ ⋯ + a n x n < b {\displaystyle a_{1}x_{1}+a_{2}x_{2}+\cdots +a_{n}x_{n}<b\ } and a 1 x 1 + a 2 x 2 + ⋯ ⋯ + a n x n > b .

{\displaystyle a_{1}x_{1}+a_{2}x_{2}+\cdots +a_{n}x_{n}>b.\ } As an example, a point is a hyperplane in 1-dimensional space, a line is a hyperplane in 2-dimensional space, and a plane is a hyperplane in 3-dimensional space. A line in 3-dimensional space is not a hyperplane, and does not separate the space into two parts (the complement of such a line is connected).

Any hyperplane of a Euclidean space has exactly two unit normal vectors: ± ± n ^ ^ {\displaystyle \pm {\hat {n}}} . In particular, if we consider R n + 1 {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n+1}} equipped with the conventional inner product ( dot product ), then one can define the affine subspace with normal vector n ^ ^ {\displaystyle {\hat {n}}} and origin translation b ~ ~ ∈ ∈ R n + 1 {\displaystyle {\tilde {b}}\in \mathbb {R} ^{n+1}} as the set of all x ∈ ∈ R n + 1 {\displaystyle x\in \mathbb {R} ^{n+1}} such that n ^ ^ ⋅ ⋅ ( x − − b ~ ~ ) = 0 {\displaystyle {\hat {n}}\cdot (x-{\tilde {b}})=0} .

Affine hyperplanes are used to define decision boundaries in many machine learning algorithms such as linear-combination (oblique) decision trees , and perceptrons .

Vector hyperplanes [ edit ] In a vector space, a vector hyperplane is a subspace of codimension 1, only possibly shifted from the origin by a vector, in which case it is referred to as a flat . Such a hyperplane is the solution of a single linear equation .

Projective hyperplanes [ edit ] Projective hyperplanes , are used in projective geometry .  A projective subspace is a set of points with the property that for any two points of the set, all the points on the line determined by the two points are contained in the set.

[ 2 ] Projective geometry can be viewed as affine geometry with vanishing points (points at infinity) added.  An affine hyperplane together with the associated points at infinity forms a projective hyperplane.  One special case of a projective hyperplane is the infinite or ideal hyperplane , which is defined with the set of all points at infinity.

In  projective space, a hyperplane does not divide the space into two parts; rather, it takes two hyperplanes to separate points and divide up the space.  The reason for this is that the space essentially "wraps around" so that both sides of a lone hyperplane are connected to each other.

Applications [ edit ] In convex geometry , two disjoint convex sets in n-dimensional Euclidean space are separated by a hyperplane, a result called the hyperplane separation theorem .

In machine learning , hyperplanes are a key tool to create support vector machines for such tasks as computer vision and natural language processing .

In multiple linear regression with more than two regressors, the datapoint and its predicted value via a linear model is a hyperplane.

In astronomy , hyperplanes can be used to calculate shortest distance between star systems, galaxies and celestial bodies with regard of general relativity and curvature of space-time as optimized geodesic or paths influenced by gravitational fields.

Dihedral angles [ edit ] The dihedral angle between two non-parallel hyperplanes of a Euclidean space is the angle between the corresponding normal vectors . The product of the transformations in the two hyperplanes is a rotation whose axis is the subspace of codimension 2 obtained by intersecting the hyperplanes, and whose angle is twice the angle between the hyperplanes.

Support hyperplanes [ edit ] A hyperplane H is called a "support" hyperplane of the polyhedron P if P is contained in one of the two closed half-spaces bounded by H and H ∩ ∩ P ≠ ≠ ∅ ∅ {\displaystyle H\cap P\neq \varnothing } .

[ 3 ] The intersection of P and H is defined to be a "face" of the polyhedron. The theory of polyhedra and the dimension of the faces are analyzed by looking at these intersections involving hyperplanes.
