Two intersecting planes: Two-dimensional planes are the hyperplanes in three-dimensional space.

In [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry"), a **hyperplane** is a generalization of a [two-dimensional plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(geometry) "Plane (geometry)") in [three-dimensional space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_space "Three-dimensional space") to [mathematical spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(mathematics) "Space (mathematics)") of arbitrary [dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension "Dimension"). Like a [plane in space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_planes_in_three-dimensional_space "Euclidean planes in three-dimensional space"), a hyperplane is a [flat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_space "Flat space")[hypersurface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersurface "Hypersurface"), a [subspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspace_(mathematics) "Subspace (mathematics)") whose [dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension "Dimension") is one less than that of the [ambient space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_space "Ambient space"). Two lower-dimensional examples of hyperplanes are [one-dimensional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-dimensional "One-dimensional")[lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_(geometry) "Line (geometry)") in a plane and [zero-dimensional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-dimensional "Zero-dimensional")[points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(geometry) "Point (geometry)") on a line.

Most commonly, the ambient space is n-dimensional [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space"), in which case the hyperplanes are the (_n_ − 1)-dimensional ["flats"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_(geometry) "Flat (geometry)"), each of which separates the space into two [half spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-space_(geometry) "Half-space (geometry)").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplane#cite_note-1) A [reflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(geometry) "Reflection (geometry)") across a hyperplane is a kind of [motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(geometry) "Motion (geometry)") ([geometric transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_transformation "Geometric transformation") preserving [distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance_(mathematics) "Distance (mathematics)") between points), and the [group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics) "Group (mathematics)") of all motions is [generated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generating_set_of_a_group "Generating set of a group") by the reflections. A [convex polytope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_polytope "Convex polytope") is the [intersection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersection_(set_theory) "Intersection (set theory)") of half-spaces.

In [non-Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Euclidean_geometry "Non-Euclidean geometry"), the ambient space might be the [n-dimensional sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-sphere "N-sphere") or [hyperbolic space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_space "Hyperbolic space"), or more generally a [pseudo-Riemannian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo-Riemannian_manifold "Pseudo-Riemannian manifold")[space form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_form "Space form"), and the hyperplanes are the hypersurfaces consisting of all [geodesics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic "Geodesic") through a point which are [perpendicular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpendicular "Perpendicular") to a specific [normal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_(geometry) "Normal (geometry)") geodesic.

In other kinds of ambient spaces, some properties from Euclidean space are no longer relevant. For example, in [affine space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_space "Affine space"), there is no concept of distance, so there are no reflections or motions. In a [non-orientable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientability "Orientability") space such as [elliptic space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_space "Elliptic space") or [projective space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_space "Projective space"), there is no concept of half-planes. In greatest generality, the notion of hyperplane is meaningful in any mathematical space in which the concept of the dimension of a [subspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_subspace "Topological subspace") is defined.

The difference in dimension between a subspace and its ambient space is known as its _[codimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codimension "Codimension")_. A hyperplane has codimension 1.

Technical description
---------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hyperplane&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Technical description")]

In [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry"), a **hyperplane** of an [_n_-dimensional space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-dimensional_space "N-dimensional space")_V_ is a subspace of dimension _n_−1, or equivalently, of [codimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codimension "Codimension")1 in _V_. The space _V_ may be a [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space") or more generally an [affine space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_space "Affine space"), or a [vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space") or a [projective space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_space "Projective space"), and the notion of hyperplane varies correspondingly since the definition of subspace differs in these settings; in all cases however, any hyperplane can be given in [coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate "Coordinate") as the solution of a single (due to the "codimension 1" constraint) [algebraic equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_equation "Algebraic equation") of degree 1.

If _V_ is a vector space, one distinguishes "vector hyperplanes" (which are [linear subspaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_subspace "Linear subspace"), and therefore must pass through the origin) and "affine hyperplanes" (which need not pass through the origin; they can be obtained by [translation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(geometry) "Translation (geometry)") of a vector hyperplane). A hyperplane in a Euclidean space separates that space into two [half spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-space_(geometry) "Half-space (geometry)"), and defines a [reflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(mathematics) "Reflection (mathematics)") that fixes the hyperplane and interchanges those two half spaces.

Special types of hyperplanes
----------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hyperplane&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Special types of hyperplanes")]

Several specific types of hyperplanes are defined with properties that are well suited for particular purposes. Some of these specializations are described here.

An **affine hyperplane** is an [affine subspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_space "Affine space") of [codimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codimension "Codimension") 1 in an [affine space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_space "Affine space"). In [Cartesian coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinates "Cartesian coordinates"), such a hyperplane can be described with a single [linear equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_equation "Linear equation") of the following form (where at least one of the ![Image 2: {\displaystyle a_{i}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0bc77764b2e74e64a63341054fa90f3e07db275f)s is non-zero and ![Image 3: {\displaystyle b}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f11423fbb2e967f986e36804a8ae4271734917c3) is an arbitrary constant):

![Image 4: {\displaystyle a_{1}x_{1}+a_{2}x_{2}+\cdots +a_{n}x_{n}=b.\ }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/cac5c60d141055c2288d239e94aef66056286eae)
In the case of a real affine space, in other words when the coordinates are real numbers, this affine space separates the space into two half-spaces, which are the [connected components](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_component_(topology) "Connected component (topology)") of the [complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_(set_theory) "Complement (set theory)") of the hyperplane, and are given by the [inequalities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inequality_(mathematics) "Inequality (mathematics)")

![Image 5: {\displaystyle a_{1}x_{1}+a_{2}x_{2}+\cdots +a_{n}x_{n}<b\ }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d0026c00504ca4f1ea860f51a5f53f7837289bde)
and

![Image 6: {\displaystyle a_{1}x_{1}+a_{2}x_{2}+\cdots +a_{n}x_{n}>b.\ }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/96f61f656ba4cdbc210c01ac6df13d0acd587c66)
As an example, a point is a hyperplane in 1-dimensional space, a line is a hyperplane in 2-dimensional space, and a plane is a hyperplane in 3-dimensional space. A line in 3-dimensional space is not a hyperplane, and does not separate the space into two parts (the complement of such a line is connected).

Any hyperplane of a Euclidean space has exactly two unit normal vectors: ![Image 7: {\displaystyle \pm {\hat {n}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fa3a327aeac9635241addd945cc7f73922d15927). In particular, if we consider ![Image 8: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n+1}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ccea3976e1f8a1bb853c8ca00e52d518a3a4fe07) equipped with the conventional inner product ([dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product "Dot product")), then one can define the affine subspace with normal vector ![Image 9: {\displaystyle {\hat {n}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d125dccc556f5c8b0bf98a4f3847590b3f353bd4) and origin translation ![Image 10: {\displaystyle {\tilde {b}}\in \mathbb {R} ^{n+1}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1614c9404410f5b631d8cebb6e85a2fe274994b9) as the set of all ![Image 11: {\displaystyle x\in \mathbb {R} ^{n+1}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f23648d8d8ed5a103a6f9dc09109eb14567af998) such that ![Image 12: {\displaystyle {\hat {n}}\cdot (x-{\tilde {b}})=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/33a3804f8e79d7d056d50574633459d10e72f549).

Affine hyperplanes are used to define decision boundaries in many [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning "Machine learning") algorithms such as linear-combination (oblique) [decision trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning "Decision tree learning"), and [perceptrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron "Perceptron").

In a vector space, a vector hyperplane is a [subspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_subspace "Linear subspace") of codimension 1, only possibly shifted from the origin by a vector, in which case it is referred to as a [flat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_(geometry) "Flat (geometry)"). Such a hyperplane is the solution of a single [linear equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_equation "Linear equation").

### Projective hyperplanes

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hyperplane&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Projective hyperplanes")]

**Projective hyperplanes**, are used in [projective geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_geometry "Projective geometry"). A [projective subspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_geometry#Projective_subspace "Projective geometry") is a set of points with the property that for any two points of the set, all the points on the line determined by the two points are contained in the set.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplane#cite_note-2) Projective geometry can be viewed as [affine geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_geometry "Affine geometry") with [vanishing points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanishing_point "Vanishing point") (points at infinity) added. An affine hyperplane together with the associated points at infinity forms a projective hyperplane. One special case of a projective hyperplane is the **infinite** or **ideal hyperplane**, which is defined with the set of all points at infinity.

In projective space, a hyperplane does not divide the space into two parts; rather, it takes two hyperplanes to separate points and divide up the space. The reason for this is that the space essentially "wraps around" so that both sides of a lone hyperplane are connected to each other.

In [convex geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_geometry "Convex geometry"), two [disjoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint_sets "Disjoint sets")[convex sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_set "Convex set") in n-dimensional Euclidean space are separated by a hyperplane, a result called the [hyperplane separation theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplane_separation_theorem "Hyperplane separation theorem").

In [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning "Machine learning"), hyperplanes are a key tool to create [support vector machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine "Support vector machine") for such tasks as [computer vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision "Computer vision") and [natural language processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing "Natural language processing").

In multiple [linear regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression "Linear regression") with more than two regressors, the datapoint and its predicted value via a linear model is a hyperplane.

In [astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy "Astronomy"), hyperplanes can be used to calculate shortest distance between star systems, galaxies and celestial bodies with regard of [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity") and curvature of [space-time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-time "Space-time") as optimized [geodesic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic "Geodesic") or paths influenced by gravitational fields.

The [dihedral angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dihedral_angle "Dihedral angle") between two non-parallel hyperplanes of a Euclidean space is the angle between the corresponding [normal vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_vector "Normal vector"). The product of the transformations in the two hyperplanes is a [rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_(mathematics) "Rotation (mathematics)") whose axis is the [subspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_subspace "Euclidean subspace") of codimension 2 obtained by intersecting the hyperplanes, and whose angle is twice the angle between the hyperplanes.

### Support hyperplanes

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hyperplane&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Support hyperplanes")]

A hyperplane H is called a "support" hyperplane of the polyhedron P if P is contained in one of the two closed half-spaces bounded by H and ![Image 13: {\displaystyle H\cap P\neq \varnothing }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a3a9064fbbf696b3f60b3549e9be27f3e99edde5).[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplane#cite_note-3) The intersection of P and H is defined to be a "face" of the polyhedron. The theory of polyhedra and the dimension of the faces are analyzed by looking at these intersections involving hyperplanes.
