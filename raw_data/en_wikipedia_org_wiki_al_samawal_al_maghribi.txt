Illustration of the al-Bahir fi'l-Jabr "The Brilliant in Algebra" from the 12th century.

Al-Samawʾal ibn Yaḥyā al-Maghribī ( Arabic : السموأل بن يحيى المغربي , c. 1130 – c. 1180), commonly known as Samawʾal al-Maghribi , was a mathematician , astronomer and physician .

[ 1 ] Born to a Jewish family of Moroccan origin, he concealed his conversion to Islam for many years for fear of offending his father, then openly embraced Islam in 1163 after he had a dream telling him to do so.

[ 2 ] His father was a rabbi from Morocco named Yehuda ibn Abūn .

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] Mathematics [ edit ] Al-Samaw'al wrote the mathematical treatise al-Bahir fi'l-jabr , meaning "The brilliant in algebra", at the age of nineteen.

He also used the two basic concepts of mathematical induction , though without stating them explicitly. He used this to extend results for the binomial theorem up to n=12 and Pascal's triangle previously given by al-Karaji .

[ 5 ] Polemics [ edit ] Arabic Wikisource has original text related to this article: al-Samaw'al He also wrote a famous polemic book in Arabic debating Judaism known as Ifḥām al-Yahūd ( Confutation of the Jews ). A Latin tract translated from Arabic and later translated into many Western languages, titled Epistola Samuelis Marrocani ad R. Isaacum contra errores Judaeorum , claims to be authored by a certain R. Samuel of Fez "about the year 1072" and is erroneously connected with him.

^ Katz (1992), p. 242: "Like the proofs of al-Karaji and ibn al-Haytham, al-Samaw'al's argument contains the two basic components of an inductive proof. He begins with a value for which the result is known, here n = 2, and then uses the result for a given integer to derive the result for the next. Since al-Samaw'al did not have any way of stating the general binomial theorem, however, he cannot be said to have proved it, by induction or otherwise. What he had done was provide a method acceptable to his readers for expanding binomials up to the twelfth power..." ^ Williams, A. Lukyn (1935).
