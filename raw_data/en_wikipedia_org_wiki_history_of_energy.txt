[Thomas Young](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Young_(scientist) "Thomas Young (scientist)") - the first to use the term "energy" to refer to kinetic energy in its modern sense, in 1802.

In the [history of physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_physics "History of physics"), the **history of energy** examines the gradual development of energy as a central scientific concept. [Classical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics "Classical mechanics") was initially understood through the study of motion and force by thinkers like [Galileo Galilei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei "Galileo Galilei") and [Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton"), the importance of the concept of energy was made clear in the 19th century with the principles of [thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamics "Thermodynamics"), particularly the [conservation of energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_of_energy "Conservation of energy") which established that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed. In the 20th century [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein")'s [mass–energy equivalence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass%E2%80%93energy_equivalence "Mass–energy equivalence") expanded this understanding by linking [mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass "Mass") and energy, and [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics") introduced quantized energy levels. Today, energy is recognized as a fundamental conserved quantity across all domains of physics, underlying both classical and quantum phenomena.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

The word _[energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy "Energy")_ derives from [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language "Greek language") word "energeia" ([Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language "Greek language"): ἐνέργεια) meaning actuality, which appears for the first time in the 4th century BCE in various works of [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle "Aristotle")[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_energy#cite_note-1) when discussing [potentiality and actuality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potentiality_and_actuality "Potentiality and actuality") including _[Physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics\_(Aristotle) "Physics (Aristotle)")_, [_Metaphysics_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics_(Aristotle) "Metaphysics (Aristotle)"), _[Nicomachean Ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicomachean\_Ethics "Nicomachean Ethics")_[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_energy#cite_note-2) and _[On the Soul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On\_the\_Soul "On the Soul")_.

The modern concept of [kinetic energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy "Kinetic energy") emerged from the idea of _[vis viva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vis\_viva "Vis viva")_ (living force), which [Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz "Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz") defined over the period 1676–1689 as the product of the mass of an object and its velocity squared; he believed that total _vis viva_ was conserved.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] To account for slowing due to friction, Leibniz claimed that heat consisted of the random motion of the constituent parts of matter — a view described by [Francis Bacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Bacon "Francis Bacon") in _[Novum Organon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novum\_Organum "Novum Organum")_ to illustrate [inductive reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning "Inductive reasoning") and shared by [Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton"), although it would be more than a century until this was generally accepted.

[Émilie du Châtelet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89milie_du_Ch%C3%A2telet "Émilie du Châtelet") in her book _Institutions de Physique_ ("Lessons in Physics"), published in 1740, incorporated the idea of Leibniz with practical observations of [Willem 's Gravesande](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willem_%27s_Gravesande "Willem 's Gravesande") to show that the "quantity of motion" of a moving object is proportional to its mass and its velocity squared (not the velocity itself as Newton taught—what was later called [momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum "Momentum")).

[Daniel Bernoulli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Bernoulli "Daniel Bernoulli") extended the _vis viva_ principle into the [Bernoulli's principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli%27s_principle "Bernoulli's principle") for fluids in his book in his work _[Hydrodynamica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrodynamica "Hydrodynamica")_ of 1738.

In 1802 lectures to the Royal Society, [Thomas Young](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Young_(scientist) "Thomas Young (scientist)") was the first to use the term _energy_ to refer to kinetic energy in its modern sense, instead of _[vis viva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vis\_viva "Vis viva")_.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_energy#cite_note-3) In the 1807 publication of those lectures, he wrote,

> The product of the mass of a body into the square of its velocity may properly be termed its energy.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_energy#cite_note-4)

[Gustave-Gaspard Coriolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustave-Gaspard_Coriolis "Gustave-Gaspard Coriolis") described "kinetic energy" in 1829 in its modern sense,

It was argued for some years whether energy was a substance (the [caloric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caloric_theory "Caloric theory")) or merely a physical quantity.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

The development of [steam engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_engines "Steam engines") in the 18th century required engineers to develop concepts and formulas that would allow them to describe the mechanical and [thermal efficiencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_efficiency "Thermal efficiency") of their systems. Engineers such as [Sadi Carnot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_L%C3%A9onard_Sadi_Carnot "Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot"), physicists such as [James Prescott Joule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Prescott_Joule "James Prescott Joule"), mathematicians such as [Émile Clapeyron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89mile_Clapeyron "Émile Clapeyron") and [Hermann von Helmholtz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_von_Helmholtz "Hermann von Helmholtz"), and amateurs such as [Julius Robert von Mayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Robert_von_Mayer "Julius Robert von Mayer") all contributed to the notion that the ability to perform certain tasks, called work, was somehow related to the amount of energy in the system. In the 1850s, Glasgow professor of natural philosophy [William Thomson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Thomson,_1st_Baron_Kelvin "William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin") and his ally in the engineering science [William Rankine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rankine "William Rankine") began to replace the older language of [mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics "Mechanics") with terms such as _actual energy_, _kinetic energy_, and _potential energy_.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_energy#cite_note-Smith-5) In 1853, Rankine coined the term "[potential energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_energy "Potential energy")."

William Thomson ([Lord Kelvin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Kelvin "Lord Kelvin")) amalgamated all of these laws into the laws of [thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamics "Thermodynamics"), which aided in the rapid development of explanations of chemical processes using the concept of energy by [Rudolf Clausius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Clausius "Rudolf Clausius"), [Josiah Willard Gibbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josiah_Willard_Gibbs "Josiah Willard Gibbs") and [Walther Nernst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walther_Nernst "Walther Nernst"). It also led to a mathematical formulation of the concept of [entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy "Entropy") by Clausius, and to the introduction of laws of [radiant energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiant_energy "Radiant energy") by [Jožef Stefan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jo%C5%BEef_Stefan "Jožef Stefan"). Rankine coined the term _potential energy_.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_energy#cite_note-Smith-5) In 1881, William Thomson stated before an audience that:[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_energy#cite_note-6)

> The very name **energy**, though first used in its present sense by Dr [Thomas Young](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Young_(scientist) "Thomas Young (scientist)") about the beginning of this century, has only come into use practically after the [doctrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_thermodynamics "History of thermodynamics") which defines it had ... been raised from mere formula of mathematical dynamics to the position it now holds of a principle pervading all nature and guiding the investigator in the field of science.

Over the following thirty years or so this newly developing science went by various names, such as the dynamical [theory of heat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_heat "Theory of heat") or _energetics_, but after the 1920s generally came to be known as [thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamics "Thermodynamics"), the science of energy transformations.

Time-translation symmetry
-------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_energy&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Time-translation symmetry")]

In 1918 [Emmy Noether](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Noether "Emmy Noether") proved that the law of [conservation of energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_of_energy "Conservation of energy") is the direct mathematical consequence of the [time-translation symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-translation_symmetry "Time-translation symmetry").[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] That is according to [Noether's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noether%27s_theorem "Noether's theorem") relating symmetries and [conserved quantity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conserved_quantity "Conserved quantity"), energy is conserved because the laws of physics do not distinguish between different moments of time.

During a 1961 lecture[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_energy#cite_note-RPF1-7) for undergraduate students at the [California Institute of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Institute_of_Technology "California Institute of Technology"), [Richard Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman "Richard Feynman"), a celebrated physics teacher and [Nobel Laureate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Laureate "Nobel Laureate"), said this about the concept of energy:

> There is a fact, or if you wish, a law, governing natural phenomena that are known to date. There is no known exception to this law—it is exact so far we know. The law is called [conservation of energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_of_energy "Conservation of energy"); it states that there is a certain quantity, which we call energy that does not change in manifold changes which nature undergoes. That is a most abstract idea, because it is a mathematical principle; it says that there is a numerical quantity, which does not change when something happens. It is not a description of a mechanism, or anything concrete; it is just a strange fact that we can calculate some number, and when we finish watching nature go through her tricks and calculate the number again, it is the same.
