The pound of force or pound-force (symbol: lbf , [ 1 ] sometimes lb f , [ 2 ] ) is a unit of force used in some systems of measurement , including English Engineering units [ a ] and the foot–pound–second system .

[ 3 ] Pound-force should not be confused with pound-mass (lb), often simply called "pound", which is a unit of mass ; nor should these be confused with foot-pound (ft⋅lbf), a unit of energy , or pound-foot (lbf⋅ft), a unit of torque .

Definitions [ edit ] The pound-force is equal to the gravitational force exerted on a mass of one avoirdupois pound on the surface of Earth . Since the 18th century, the unit has been used in low-precision measurements, for which small changes in Earth's gravity (which varies from equator to pole by up to half a percent) can safely be neglected.

[ 4 ] The 20th century, however, brought the need for a more precise definition, requiring a standardized value for acceleration due to gravity.

Product of avoirdupois pound and standard gravity [ edit ] The pound-force is the product of one avoirdupois pound ( exactly 0.45359237 kg) and the standard acceleration due to gravity , approximately 32.174049 ft/s 2 (9.80665 m/s 2 ).

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] The standard values of acceleration of the standard gravitational field ( g n ) and the international avoirdupois pound (lb) result in a pound-force equal to 32.174 049 ⁠ ft⋅lb / s 2 ⁠ (4.4482216152605 N).

[ b ] 1 lbf = 1 lb × × g n = 1 lb × × 9.80665 m s 2 / 0.3048 m ft ≈ ≈ 1 lb × × 32.174049 f t s 2 ≈ ≈ 32.174049 f t ⋅ ⋅ l b s 2 1 lbf = 1 lb × × 0.45359237 kg lb × × g n = 0.45359237 kg × × 9.80665 m s 2 = 4.4482216152605 N {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}1\,{\text{lbf}}&=1\,{\text{lb}}\times g_{\text{n}}\\&=1\,{\text{lb}}\times 9.80665\,{\tfrac {\text{m}}{{\text{s}}^{2}}}/0.3048\,{\tfrac {\text{m}}{\text{ft}}}\\&\approx 1\,{\text{lb}}\times 32.174049\,\mathrm {\tfrac {ft}{s^{2}}} \\&\approx 32.174049\,\mathrm {\tfrac {ft{\cdot }lb}{s^{2}}} \\1\,{\text{lbf}}&=1\,{\text{lb}}\times 0.45359237\,{\tfrac {\text{kg}}{\text{lb}}}\times g_{\text{n}}\\&=0.45359237\,{\text{kg}}\times 9.80665\,{\tfrac {\text{m}}{{\text{s}}^{2}}}\\&=4.4482216152605\,{\text{N}}\end{aligned}}} This definition can be rephrased in terms of the slug . A slug has a mass of 32.174049 lb.  A pound-force is the amount of force required to accelerate a slug at a rate of 1 ft/s 2 , so: 1 lbf = 1 slug × × 1 ft s 2 = 1 slug ⋅ ⋅ ft s 2 {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}1\,{\text{lbf}}&=1\,{\text{slug}}\times 1\,{\tfrac {\text{ft}}{{\text{s}}^{2}}}\\&=1\,{\tfrac {{\text{slug}}\cdot {\text{ft}}}{{\text{s}}^{2}}}\end{aligned}}} Conversion to other units [ edit ] Units of force v t e newton dyne kilogram-force , kilopond pound-force poundal 1 N ≡ 1 kg⋅m/s 2 = 10 5 dyn ≈ 0.101 97 kp ≈ 0.224 81 lb F ≈ 7.2330 pdl 1 dyn = 10 −5 N ≡ 1 g⋅cm/s 2 ≈ 1.0197 × 10 −6 kp ≈ 2.2481 × 10 −6 lb F ≈ 7.2330 × 10 −5 pdl 1 kp = 9.806 65 N = 980 665 dyn ≡ g n × 1 kg ≈ 2.2046 lb F ≈ 70.932 pdl 1 lb F ≈ 4.448 222 N ≈ 444 822 dyn ≈ 0.453 59 kp ≡ g n × 1 lb ≈ 32.174 pdl 1 pdl ≈ 0.138 255 N ≈ 13 825 dyn ≈ 0.014 098 kp ≈ 0.031 081 lb F ≡ 1 lb⋅ ft /s 2 The value of g n ( 9.806 65 m/s 2 ) as used in the official definition of the kilogram-force is used here for all gravitational units.

Foot–pound–second (FPS) systems of units [ edit ] Main article: Foot–pound–second system In some contexts, the term "pound" is used almost exclusively to refer to the unit of force and not the unit of mass. In those applications, the preferred unit of mass is the slug, i.e. lbf⋅s 2 /ft. In other contexts, the unit "pound" refers to a unit of mass .  The international standard symbol for the pound as a unit of mass is lb.

This is convenient because one pound mass exerts one pound force due to gravity. Note, however, unlike the other systems the force unit is not equal to the mass unit multiplied by the acceleration unit [ 11 ] —the use of Newton's second law , F = m ⋅ a , requires another factor, g c , usually taken to be 32.174049 (lb⋅ft)/(lbf⋅s 2 ).
"Absolute" systems are coherent systems of units: by using the slug as the unit of mass, the "gravitational" FPS system (left column) avoids the need for such a constant. The SI is an "absolute" metric system with kilogram and meter as base units.

Pound of thrust [ edit ] Further information: thrust The term pound of thrust is an alternative name for pound-force in specific contexts. It is frequently seen in US sources on jet engines and rocketry, some of which continue to use the FPS notation. For example, the thrust produced by each of the Space Shuttle 's two Solid Rocket Boosters was 3,300,000 pounds-force (14.7 MN ), together 6,600,000 pounds-force (29.4 MN).
