His research interests included projective differential geometry and topology . He is especially known for the technique known as Stone–Čech compactification (in topology) and the notion of Čech cohomology . He was the first to publish a proof of Tychonoff's theorem in 1937.

Biography [ edit ] He was born in Stračov , then in Bohemia , Austria-Hungary , now in the Czech Republic . His father was Čeněk Čech, a policeman, and his mother was Anna Kleplová.

[ 1 ] After attending the gymnasium in Hradec Králové , Čech was admitted to the Philosophy Faculty of Charles University of Prague in 1912. In 1915 he was drafted into the Austro-Hungarian Army and participated in World War I , after which he completed his undergraduate degree in 1918.

[ 1 ] He received his doctoral degree in 1920 at Charles University; his thesis, titled On Curves and Plane Elements of the Third Order , was written under the direction of Karel Petr .

[ 2 ] In 1921–1922 he collaborated with Guido Fubini in Turin , Italy. He taught at Masaryk University in Brno and at Charles University.

Ivo Babuška , Vlastimil Dlab , Zdeněk Frolík , Věra Trnková , and Petr Vopěnka have been doctoral students of Čech.

[ 2 ] He attended the First International Topological Conference held in Moscow 4–10 September 1935. He made two presentations there: "Accessibility and homology" and " Betti groups with different coefficient groups".

[ 3 ] He died in Prague in 1960.
