GOLIAT [ edit ] Goliat is the first Romanian artificial microsatellite, launched on February 13, 2012.

[ 19 ] It was selected to be launched into orbit by the European Vega rocket , on its first operational flight.

[ 20 ] The system was developed and designed by ROSA in collaboration with the Institute of Space Sciences, BITNET and ELPROF companies between 2005 and 2007. The microsatellite is a cube with sides of 10 inches and a weight of one kilogram.

The Goliat mission was funded by the National Authority for Scientific Exploration within the National Excellence Research program and it has an educational character, being the first microsatellite launched in a ROSA space program.

RoBiSAT [ edit ] RoBiSAT represents the second Romanian artificial nanosatellites mission. The mission is composed of 2 Cubesat 2U-type satellites and was supposed to be part of the QB50 constellation. They were to be sent to the ISS in the second quarter of 2017 on the Cygnus CRS OA-7 however the mission was postponed indefinitely.

[ 21 ] [ 22 ] The two nanosatellites, called RoBiSAT 1 and RoBiSAT 2, were built at the Institute of Space Science located in Magurele , Romania .

Bilateral agreements International organizations membership and/or national representative: COSPAR, IAF, IAA, EURISY, ACARE, EREA, ASD, EDA, others Bilateral agreements with research organizations Joining ESA [ edit ] The first agreement between Romania and the European Space Agency (ESA) was signed in 1992, [ 24 ] followed in 1999 by the Romania–ESA Agreement on cooperation in the peaceful exploration and use of space. Since 2007, Romania contributes to the ESA budget as a European Cooperating State (PECS), status ratified by Law no. 1/2007 .

On December 22, 2011, Romania became the 19th member of the European Space Agency.

An important step in the accession process was to conduct a technical audit on the relevant entities in Romania (institutes, research centres, industrial companies and SMEs), which have space technological capabilities. The audit was conducted by ESA, based on a sample of 130 entities, 50 of them being organized technical visits and interviews.

The full member state of the European Space Agency status gives the organizations in Romania access, in the same way as the ESA countries, to all programs run. This is an important technology transfer and the opening of a high-tech market. The intellectual property is maintained at a national level, having an important role in the establishment of competence in the country.

Research [ edit ] ROSA Research Center [ edit ] The ROSA Research Center (RRC) was formed in 1998. Another step was the joint venture agreements concluded with CRUTA — the Romanian Center for Remote Sensing Applications in Agriculture — an SME laboratory initially organized as an independent branch of the ISPIF (Research and Development Institute for Land Use). A joint venture agreement was concluded with the Institute of Space Science in Bucharest.

Since 2006, on behalf of the Romanian Government, ROSA has strengthened its relationship with ESA by signing a PECS agreement.

RRC developed, since 2003, R&D projects addressing national strategy, as well as technological development in the GNSS field. One of the last projects, “Capacity, Infrastructure and Applications for GNSS-GALILEO” directly addressed the problem of extending EGNOS in Eastern Europe through infrastructure development.
