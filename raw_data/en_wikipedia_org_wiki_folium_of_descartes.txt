{\displaystyle x^{3}+y^{3}-3a\cdot xy=0.} [ 1 ] d y / d x = ( x 2 − − a y ) / ( a x − − y 2 ) , d x / d y = ( a x − − y 2 ) / ( x 2 − − a y ) .

[ 2 ] Its claim to fame lies in an incident in the development of calculus . Descartes challenged Pierre de Fermat to find the tangent line to the curve at an arbitrary point, since Fermat had recently discovered a method for finding tangent lines. Fermat solved the problem easily, something Descartes was unable to do.

[ 3 ] Since the invention of calculus, the slope of the tangent line can be found easily using implicit differentiation .

[ 4 ] Mayor Johan(nes) Hudde 's second letter on maxima and minima (1658) mentions his calculation of the maximum width of the closed loop, part of Mathematical Exercitions , 5 books (1656/57 Leyden) p. 498, by Frans van Schooten Jnr.

Graphing the curve [ edit ] Folium of Descartes in polar coordinates r-φ: r ( ϕ ϕ ) / a , a = 1 {\textstyle r(\phi )/a,\,a=1} The folium of Descartes can be expressed in polar coordinates as r = 3 a sin ⁡ ⁡ θ θ cos ⁡ ⁡ θ θ sin 3 ⁡ ⁡ θ θ + cos 3 ⁡ ⁡ θ θ , {\displaystyle r={\frac {3a\sin \theta \cos \theta }{\sin ^{3}\theta +\cos ^{3}\theta }},} which is plotted on the left. This is equivalent to [ 5 ] r = 3 a sec ⁡ ⁡ θ θ tan ⁡ ⁡ θ θ 1 + tan 3 ⁡ ⁡ θ θ .

{\displaystyle r={\frac {3a\sec \theta \tan \theta }{1+\tan ^{3}\theta }}.} Another technique is to write y = p x {\displaystyle y=px} and solve for x {\displaystyle x} and y {\displaystyle y} in terms of p {\displaystyle p} . This yields the rational parametric equations : [ 6 ] x = 3 a p 1 + p 3 , y = 3 a p 2 1 + p 3 .

{\displaystyle x={{3ap} \over {1+p^{3}}},\,y={{3ap^{2}} \over {1+p^{3}}}.} We can see that the parameter is related to the position on the curve as follows: p < − − 1 {\displaystyle p<-1} corresponds to x > 0 {\displaystyle x>0} , y < 0 {\displaystyle y<0} : the right, lower, "wing".

− − 1 < p < 0 {\displaystyle -1<p<0} corresponds to x < 0 {\displaystyle x<0} , y > 0 {\displaystyle y>0} : the left, upper "wing".

p > 0 {\displaystyle p>0} corresponds to x > 0 {\displaystyle x>0} , y > 0 {\displaystyle y>0} : the loop of the curve.

Another way of plotting the function can be derived from symmetry over y = x {\displaystyle y=x} . The symmetry can be seen directly from its equation (x and y can be interchanged). By applying rotation of 45° clockwise for example, one can plot the function symmetric over rotated x axis.

This operation is equivalent to a substitution: x = u + v 2 , y = u − − v 2 {\displaystyle x={{u+v} \over {\sqrt {2}}},\,y={{u-v} \over {\sqrt {2}}}} and yields v = ± ± u 3 a 2 − − 2 u 6 u + 3 a 2 , u < 3 a / 2 .

{\displaystyle v=\pm u{\sqrt {\frac {3a{\sqrt {2}}-2u}{6u+3a{\sqrt {2}}}}}\,,\,u<3a/{\sqrt {2}}.} Plotting in the Cartesian system of ( u , v ) {\displaystyle (u,v)} gives the folium rotated by 45° and therefore symmetric by u {\displaystyle u} -axis.

Properties [ edit ] It forms a loop in the first quadrant with a double point at the origin and has asymptote x + y = − − a .

{\displaystyle x+y=-a\,.} It is symmetrical about the line y = x {\displaystyle y=x} . As such, the curve and this line intersect at the origin and at the point ( 3 a / 2 , 3 a / 2 ) .

{\textstyle (3a/2,3a/2).} Implicit differentiation gives the formula for the slope of the tangent line to this curve to be [ 4 ] d y d x = a y − − x 2 y 2 − − a x , {\displaystyle {\frac {dy}{dx}}={\frac {ay-x^{2}}{y^{2}-ax}}\,,} with poles x = y 2 / a {\textstyle x=y^{2}/a} and value 0 or ±∞ at origin (0,0).

Using either one of the polar representations above, the area of the interior of the loop is found to be 1 1 2 a ⋅ ⋅ a .

{\textstyle 1{\frac {1}{2}}a\cdot a.} Moreover, the area between the "wings" of the curve and its slanted asymptote is also 3 a 2 / 2.

{\textstyle 3a^{2}/2.} [ 2 ] Relationship to the trisectrix of Maclaurin [ edit ] Trisectrix of Maclaurin: top angle is ⁠ 2 / 3 ⁠ φ. Length ⁠1 + 1 / 2 ⁠ a on hor. axis, O to turning point.

The folium of Descartes is related to the trisectrix of Maclaurin by affine transformation . To see this, start with the equation x 3 + y 3 = 3 a ⋅ ⋅ x y , {\displaystyle x^{3}+y^{3}=3a\cdot xy\,,} and change variables to find the equation in a coordinate system rotated 45 degrees. This amounts to setting x = X + Y 2 , y = X − − Y 2 .

{\displaystyle x={{X+Y} \over {\sqrt {2}}},y={{X-Y} \over {\sqrt {2}}}.} In the X , Y {\displaystyle X,Y} plane the equation is 2 X ( X 2 + 3 Y 2 ) = 3 2 a ( X 2 − − Y 2 ) .

{\displaystyle 2X(X^{2}+3Y^{2})=3{\sqrt {2}}a(X^{2}-Y^{2}).} If we stretch the curve in the Y {\displaystyle Y} direction by a factor of 3 {\displaystyle {\sqrt {3}}} this becomes 2 X ( X 2 + Y 2 ) = a 2 ( 3 X 2 − − Y 2 ) , {\displaystyle 2X(X^{2}+Y^{2})=a{\sqrt {2}}(3X^{2}-Y^{2}),} which is the equation of the trisectrix of Maclaurin.
