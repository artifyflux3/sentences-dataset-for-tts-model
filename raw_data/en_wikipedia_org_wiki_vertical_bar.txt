The **vertical bar**, |, is a [glyph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyph "Glyph") with various uses in [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), [computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing "Computing"), and [typography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typography "Typography"). It has many names, often related to particular meanings: [Sheffer stroke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheffer_stroke "Sheffer stroke") (in [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_logic "Mathematical logic")), **pipe**, **bar**, **or** (literally, the word "or"), **vbar**, and others.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_bar#cite_note-1)

The vertical bar is used as a [mathematical symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_mathematical_symbols "Table of mathematical symbols") in numerous ways. If used as a pair of brackets, it suggests the notion of the word "size". These are:

Likewise, the vertical bar is also used singly in many different ways:

*   [conditional probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_probability "Conditional probability"): ![Image 1: {\displaystyle P(X|Y)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/38c2f827fbc72053662e88bb04636eca0fc5cd0f), read "the [probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability "Probability") of _X_ _given_ _Y_"
*   [distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance "Distance"): ![Image 2: {\displaystyle P|ab}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1deca1d51f7ea927224a29c255dac8c8386ca705), denoting the shortest _distance_ between point ![Image 3: {\displaystyle P}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b4dc73bf40314945ff376bd363916a738548d40a) to line ![Image 4: {\displaystyle ab}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/49337c5cf256196e2292f7047cb5da68c24ca95d), so line ![Image 5: {\displaystyle P|ab}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1deca1d51f7ea927224a29c255dac8c8386ca705) is perpendicular to line ![Image 6: {\displaystyle ab}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/49337c5cf256196e2292f7047cb5da68c24ca95d)
*   [divisibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divisibility "Divisibility"): ![Image 7: {\displaystyle a\mid b}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/70ab1c16db0f00b6cc26bcd7dae49514f5aadfff), read "_a_ _divides_ _b_" or "_a_ is a _factor_ of _b_", though Unicode also provides special 'divides' and 'does not divide' symbols (U+2223∣DIVIDES and U+2224∤DOES NOT DIVIDE)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_bar#cite_note-Weisstein-2)
*   [function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics) "Function (mathematics)") evaluation: ![Image 8: {\displaystyle f(x)|_{x=4}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1d839c532708e56897b2f9607fb5f72ab3e41af3), read "_f_ of _x_, evaluated at _x_ equals 4" (see [subscripts](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Advanced_Mathematics#Subscripts_and_superscripts "b:LaTeX/Advanced Mathematics") at Wikibooks)
*   [restriction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_(mathematics) "Restriction (mathematics)"): ![Image 9: {\displaystyle f|_{A}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/717abad132f2fe4244a97fda2a6fdbebd803aa13), denoting the _restriction_ of the function ![Image 10: {\displaystyle f}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/132e57acb643253e7810ee9702d9581f159a1c61), with a domain that is a superset of ![Image 11: {\displaystyle A}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3), to just ![Image 12: {\displaystyle A}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3)
*   [set-builder notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set-builder_notation "Set-builder notation"): ![Image 13: {\displaystyle \{x|x<2\}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/71c9de477455e42af47732b131c69d4112d5f09b), read "the set of _x_ _such that_ _x_ is [less than](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Less_than "Less than") two". Often, a [colon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation) "Colon (punctuation)") ':' is used instead of a vertical bar
*   the [Sheffer stroke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheffer_stroke "Sheffer stroke") in [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic "Logic"): ![Image 14: {\displaystyle a|b}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e801f5cb365c0f6ecd505ba404220ee7c1c43a11), read "_a_ _nand_ _b_"
*   [subtraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtraction "Subtraction"): ![Image 15: {\displaystyle f(x)\vert _{a}^{b}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/636e1910bcf5f5adf28819d4fa2108195b5458e8), read "_f(x)_ _from_ _a_ _to_ _b_", denoting ![Image 16: {\displaystyle f(b)-f(a)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/00c225287e5e23ab02d187bacf055973afc97c96). Used in the context of a definite integral with variable _x_.
*   A vertical bar can be used to separate variables from fixed parameters in a function, for example ![Image 17: {\displaystyle f(x|\mu ,\sigma )}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/26c02a082a2989805a4050d9f403385553d46d08), or in the notation for [elliptic integrals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_integrals "Elliptic integrals").

The **double vertical bar**, ![Image 18: {\displaystyle \|}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e255cbbb457d7ea0755f9ef09aeaf29995e5d980), is also employed in mathematics.

In LaTeX [mathematical mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX#math_mode "TeX"), the ASCII vertical bar produces a vertical line, and `\|` creates a double vertical line (`a | b \| c` is set as ![Image 19: {\displaystyle a|b\|c}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8b99098a5f34b56d3793482341bd661ad67914de)). This has different spacing from `\mid` and `\parallel`, which are [relational operators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_operator "Relational operator"): `a \mid b \parallel c` is set as ![Image 20: {\displaystyle a\mid b\parallel c}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b51623e10c2122d779090c11aae7e796782d20b4). See below about [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX "LaTeX") in text mode.

In chemistry, the vertical line is used in [cell notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_notation "Cell notation") of electrochemical cells.

Example,

Zn | Zn 2+ || Cu 2+ | Cu

Single vertical lines show components of the cell which do not mix, usually being in different phases. The double vertical line ( || ) is used to represent salt bridge; which is used to allow free moving ions to move.

The vertical bar is used in [bra–ket notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bra%E2%80%93ket_notation "Bra–ket notation") in [quantum physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_physics "Quantum physics"). Examples:

A [pipe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipe_(Unix) "Pipe (Unix)") is an [inter-process communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-process_communication "Inter-process communication") mechanism originating in [Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix "Unix"), which directs the output (standard out and, optionally, standard error) of one process to the input (standard in) of another. In this way, a series of commands can be "piped" together, giving users the ability to quickly perform complex multi-stage processing from the [command line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface "Command-line interface") or as part of a [Unix shell script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIX_shell_script "UNIX shell script") ("bash file"). In most [Unix shells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell "Unix shell") (command interpreters), this is represented by the vertical bar character. For example:

`grep -i 'blair' filename.log | more`

where the output from the grep process (all lines containing 'blair') is piped to the more process (which allows a command line user to read through results one page at a time).

The same "pipe" feature is also found in later versions of [DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS "DOS") and Microsoft Windows.

This usage has led to the character itself being called "pipe".

In many programming languages, the vertical bar is used to designate the [logic operation _or_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction "Logical disjunction"), either [bitwise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation "Bitwise operation")_or_ or [logical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_data_type "Boolean data type")_or_.

Specifically, in [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language) "C (programming language)") and other languages following [C syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_syntax "C syntax") conventions, such as [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B "C++"), [Perl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl "Perl"), [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language) "Java (programming language)") and [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language) "C Sharp (programming language)"), `a | b` denotes a [bitwise _or_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR "Bitwise operation"); whereas a double vertical bar `a || b` denotes a ([short-circuited](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_evaluation "Minimal evaluation")) [logical _or_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction "Logical disjunction"). Since the character was originally not available in all [code pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_page "Code page") and keyboard layouts, [ANSI C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_C "ANSI C") can transcribe it in form of the [trigraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_trigraph "C trigraph")`??!`, which, outside string literals, is equivalent to the `|` character.

In [regular expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression "Regular expression") syntax, the vertical bar again indicates logical _or_ ([alternation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternation_(formal_language_theory) "Alternation (formal language theory)")). For example: the Unix command `grep -E 'fu|bar'` matches lines containing 'fu' or 'bar'.

The double vertical bar operator "||" denotes [string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science) "String (computer science)")[concatenation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concatenation "Concatenation") in [PL/I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PL/I "PL/I"), [REXX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rexx "Rexx"), [ooRexx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_REXX "Object REXX"), standard [ANSI SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_SQL "ANSI SQL"), and theoretical computer science (particularly [cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography "Cryptography")).

Although not as common as commas or tabs, the vertical bar can be used as a [delimiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delimiter "Delimiter") in a [flat file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_file "Flat file"). Examples of a [pipe-delimited](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipe_delimited "Pipe delimited") standard data format are [LEDES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LEDES "LEDES") 1998B and [HL7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HL7 "HL7"). It is frequently used because vertical bars are typically uncommon in the data itself.

Similarly, the vertical bar may see use as a delimiter for [regular expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression "Regular expression") operations (e.g. in [sed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sed "Sed")). This is useful when the regular expression contains instances of the more common forward slash (`/`) delimiter; using a vertical bar eliminates the need to escape all instances of the forward slash. However, this makes the bar unusable as the regular expression "alternative" operator.

In [Backus–Naur form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form "Backus–Naur form"), an expression consists of sequences of symbols and/or sequences separated by '|', indicating a [choice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternation_(formal_language_theory) "Alternation (formal language theory)"), the whole being a possible substitution for the symbol on the left.

<personal-name> ::= <name> | <initial>

#### Concurrency operator

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vertical_bar&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Concurrency operator")]

In calculi of communicating processes (like [pi-calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi-calculus "Pi-calculus")), the vertical bar is used to indicate that processes execute in parallel.

The pipe in [APL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_(programming_language) "APL (programming language)") is the modulo or _residue_ function between two operands and the absolute value function next to one operand.

#### List comprehensions

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vertical_bar&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: List comprehensions")]

The vertical bar is used for list comprehensions in some functional languages, e.g. [Haskell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_(programming_language) "Haskell (programming language)") and [Erlang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_(programming_language) "Erlang (programming language)"). Compare [set-builder notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_bar#Mathematics).

The vertical bar is used as a special character in [lightweight markup languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_markup_language "Lightweight markup language"), notably [MediaWiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaWiki "MediaWiki")'s [Wikitext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikitext "Wikitext") (in the templates and internal links).

In LaTeX text mode, the vertical bar produces an [em dash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Em_dash "Em dash") (—). The `\textbar` command can be used to produce a vertical bar.

### Phonetics and orthography

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vertical_bar&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Phonetics and orthography")]

In the [Khoisan languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khoisan_languages "Khoisan languages") and the [International Phonetic Alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet "International Phonetic Alphabet"), the vertical bar is used to write the [dental click](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_click "Dental click") (ǀ). A double vertical bar is used to write the [alveolar lateral click](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alveolar_lateral_click "Alveolar lateral click") (ǁ). Since these are technically letters, they have their own [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode "Unicode") code points in the [Latin Extended-B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_Extended-B "Latin Extended-B") range: U+01C0 ǀ LATIN LETTER DENTAL CLICK and U+01C1 ǁ LATIN LETTER LATERAL CLICK.

Some [Northwest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_Caucasian_languages "Northwest Caucasian languages") and [Northeast Caucasian languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_Caucasian_languages "Northeast Caucasian languages") written in the [Cyrillic script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrillic_script "Cyrillic script") have a vertical bar called [palochka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palochka "Palochka") ([Russian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language "Russian language"): палочка, [lit.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literal_translation "Literal translation")'little stick'), indicating the preceding consonant is an [ejective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejective_consonant "Ejective consonant").

Longer single and double vertical bars are used to mark [prosodic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosody_(linguistics) "Prosody (linguistics)") boundaries in the IPA.

In medieval European manuscripts, a single vertical bar was a common variant of the [virgula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation) "Slash (punctuation)")[/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki// "/") used as a [comma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma "Comma"),[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_bar#cite_note-verg-7) or [caesura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesura "Caesura") mark.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_bar#cite_note-verg-7)

In [Sanskrit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit "Sanskrit") and other [Indian languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_India "Languages of India"), a single vertical mark, ।, called a [danda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danda "Danda"), has a similar function as a period (full stop). Two bars, ॥, (a 'double danda') is the equivalent of a [pilcrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilcrow "Pilcrow") in marking the end of a [stanza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanza "Stanza"), paragraph or section. The danda has its own Unicode code point, U+0964।DEVANAGARI DANDA; as does the double danda: U+0965॥DEVANAGARI DOUBLE DANDA.

A double vertical bar ⟨||⟩ or ⟨‖⟩[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] is the standard _[caesura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesura "Caesura") mark_ in English [literary criticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_criticism "Literary criticism") and analysis. It marks the strong break or [caesura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesura "Caesura") common to many forms of [poetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poetry "Poetry"), particularly [Old English verse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English_poetry "Old English poetry"). It is also traditionally used to mark the division between lines of verse printed as prose (the style preferred by [Oxford University Press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_University_Press "Oxford University Press")), though it is now often replaced by the [forward slash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_slash "Forward slash").[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

In the [Geneva Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_Bible "Geneva Bible") and early printings of the [King James Version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_James_Version "King James Version"), a double vertical bar is used to mark [margin notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginalia "Marginalia") that contain an alternative translation from the original text. These margin notes always begin with the conjunction "Or". In later printings of the King James Version, the double vertical bar is irregularly used to mark any comment in the margins.

A double vertical bar symbol may be used to call out a [footnote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Footnote "Footnote"). (The traditional order of these symbols in English is [*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk "Asterisk"), [†](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagger_(mark) "Dagger (mark)"), [‡](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagger_(mark) "Dagger (mark)"), [§](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_sign "Section sign"), ‖, [¶](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilcrow "Pilcrow"), so its use is very rare; in modern usage, numbers and letters are preferred for [endnotes and footnotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note_(typography) "Note (typography)").[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_bar#cite_note-8))

In music, when writing chord sheets, single vertical bars associated with a colon (|: A / / /:|) represents the beginning and end of a section (e.g. Intro, Interlude, Verse, Chorus) of music.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] Single bars can also represent the beginning and end of measures (|: A / / / | D / / / | E / / /:|). A double vertical bar associated with a colon can represent the repeat of a given section (||: A / / /:|| - play twice).[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

[![Image 21](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/Dot_printer_ASCII0x7C%2B.png/330px-Dot_printer_ASCII0x7C%2B.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Dot_printer_ASCII0x7C%2B.png)

The code point 124 (7C [hexadecimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal "Hexadecimal")) is occupied by a broken bar in a [dot matrix printer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_matrix_printer "Dot matrix printer") of the late 1980s, which apparently lacks a solid vertical bar. See the [full picture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Dot_printer_ASCII.png "File:Dot printer ASCII.png").

Many early video terminals and [dot-matrix printers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-matrix_printers "Dot-matrix printers") rendered the vertical bar character as the [allograph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allograph "Allograph")**broken bar**¦. This may have been to distinguish the character from the lower-case 'L' and the upper-case 'I' on these limited-resolution devices, and to make a vertical line of them look more like a horizontal line of dashes. It was also (briefly) part of the [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII "ASCII") standard.

An initial draft for a 7-bit character set that was published by the X3.2 subcommittee for Coded Character Sets and Data Format on June 8, 1961, was the first to include the vertical bar in a standard set. The bar was intended to be used as the representation for the [logical OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_OR "Logical OR") symbol.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_bar#cite_note-evolutionchar-9) A subsequent draft on May 12, 1966, places the vertical bar in column 7 alongside regional entry codepoints, and formed the basis for the original draft proposal used by the [International Standards Organisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Standards_Organisation "International Standards Organisation").[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_bar#cite_note-evolutionchar-9) This draft received opposition from the [IBM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM "IBM") user group [SHARE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHARE_(computing) "SHARE (computing)"), with its chairman, H. W. Nelson, writing a letter to the [American Standards Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Standards_Association "American Standards Association") titled "The Proposed revised American Standard Code for Information Interchange does NOT meet the needs of computer programmers!"; in this letter, he argues that no characters within the international subset designated at columns 2-5 of the character set would be able to adequately represent logical OR and [logical NOT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negation "Negation") in languages such as IBM's [PL/I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PL/I "PL/I") universally on all platforms.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_bar#cite_note-10) As a compromise, a requirement was introduced where the [exclamation mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark "Exclamation mark") (!) and [circumflex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumflex "Circumflex") (^) would display as logical OR (|) and logical NOT (¬) respectively in use cases such as programming, while outside of these use cases they would represent their original typographic symbols:

> "It may be desirable to employ distinctive styling to facilitate their use for specific purposes as, for example, to stylize the graphics in code positions 2/1 and 5/14 to those frequently associated with logical OR (|) and logical NOT (¬) respectively."

— X3.2 document X3.2/475[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_bar#cite_note-11)

The original vertical bar encoded at 0x7C in the original May 12, 1966 draft was then broken as ¦, so it could not be confused with the unbroken logical OR. In the 1967 revision of ASCII, along with the equivalent ISO 464 code published the same year, the code point was defined to be a broken vertical bar, and the exclamation mark character was allowed to be rendered as a solid vertical bar.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_bar#cite_note-Salste_2016-12)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_bar#cite_note-Korpela-13) However, the 1977 revision (ANSI X.3-1977) undid the changes made in the 1967 revision, enforcing that the circumflex could no longer be stylised as a logical NOT symbol, the exclamation mark likewise no longer allowing stylisation as a vertical bar, and defining the code point originally set to the broken bar as a solid vertical bar instead;[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_bar#cite_note-Salste_2016-12) the same changes were also reverted in ISO 646-1973 published four years prior.

Some variants of [EBCDIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBCDIC "EBCDIC") included both versions of the character as different code points. The broad implementation of the [extended ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_ASCII "Extended ASCII")[ISO/IEC 8859](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859 "ISO/IEC 8859") series in the 1990s also made a distinction between the two forms. This was preserved in Unicode as a separate character at U+00A6¦BROKEN BAR (the term "parted rule" is used sometimes in Unicode documentation). Some fonts draw the characters the same (both are solid vertical bars, or both are broken vertical bars).[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_bar#cite_note-14)[_[failed verification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability "Wikipedia:Verifiability")_]

The broken bar does not appear to have any clearly identified uses distinct from those of the vertical bar.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_bar#cite_note-15) In non-computing use — for example in mathematics, physics and general typography — the broken bar is not an acceptable substitute for the vertical bar. In some dictionaries, the broken bar is used to mark stress that may be either primary or secondary: [¦ba] covers the pronunciations [ˈba] and [ˌba].[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_bar#cite_note-16)

1.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_bar#cite_ref-17)**The Shift JIS and EUC encoded forms also include the ASCII vertical bar in its usual encoding (see [halfwidth and fullwidth forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halfwidth_and_fullwidth_forms "Halfwidth and fullwidth forms")). The same applies when the 7-bit form is used as part of [ISO-2022-JP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO-2022-JP "ISO-2022-JP") (allowing switching to and from ASCII).
