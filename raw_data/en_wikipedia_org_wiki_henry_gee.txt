Henry Gee, who is now Senior Editor of Nature , was a witness of this turmoil because he was working at the museum as a student in the 1970s, when he got to know the chief actors in the drama.  He remains convinced that the science of cladistics is a vital intellectual tool for our understanding of what he calls Deep Time , to distinguish it from ordinary historical time, which he sees as being qualitatively as well as quantitatively different.
