The range is located near Titan's equator , between 2° and 4° south, and 211° and 214° west.

[ 1 ] It is located within the Adiri region, just west of the landing site of the Huygens probe .

[ 2 ] The Taniquetil Montes are named after Taniquetil , a mountain in the Undying Lands in J. R. R. Tolkien 's fictional universe.

[ 1 ] The name follows a convention that Titanean mountains are named after mountains in Tolkien's work.

[ 3 ] It was formally announced on November 13, 2012.
