Meteorological history Formed May 4, 2007, 9:03 p.m.

CDT ( UTC−05:00 ) Dissipated May 4, 2007, 10:05 p.m. CDT (UTC−05:00) Duration 1 hour, 2 minutes EF5 tornado on the Enhanced Fujita scale Path length 28.8 miles (46.3 km) Highest winds 205 mph (330 km/h) [ 1 ] Overall effects Fatalities 12 Injuries 63 Damage 95% of Greensburg damaged to some degree Economic losses $250 million (2007 USD) Areas affected Greensburg, Kansas , US Part of the Tornado outbreak of May 4–6, 2007 and Tornadoes of 2007 In the evening hours of Friday, May 4, 2007, amid a tornado outbreak across the central United States , a devastating tornado moved through Kiowa County, Kansas , heavily damaging the town of Greensburg . The tornado, known as the Greensburg tornado , [ 2 ] or the Greensburg, Kansas EF5 Tornado , [ 3 ] tracked 28.8 miles (46.3 km) through the area, killing 12 people and injuring 63 others. The tornado was the first to be rated EF5 on the Enhanced Fujita scale after the retirement of the original Fujita scale in the United States on February 1, 2007.

The tornado touched down south of Greensburg at around 9:03 p.m. CDT, [ note 1 ] moving to the north while continuously widening. The tornado eventually entered Kiowa County, crossing U.S. Route 183 before reaching a peak width of 1.7 miles (2.7 km) to the south of Greensburg before entering the city. The tornado heavily damaged Greensburg; 662 structures in the town sustained some form of damage before the tornado left the area. The tornado dissipated northwest of Greensburg after being on the ground for shortly over an hour.

The tornado devastated Greensburg, damaging 95% of the town and leaving monetary losses of $250 million (2007 USD) [ note 2 ] in its wake. Kiowa County, the county in which Greensburg is located, was declared a disaster area in the immediate aftermath of the tornado. Rebuilding efforts after the tornado were intensive, and several major government agencies collaborated with state agencies to help rebuild the town with the goal of making it a "green town" using a long-term community recovery (LTCR) plan. The plan included requiring all buildings in Greensburg to gain LEED Platinum certification, along with installing wind turbines in the city. The Kiowa County Memorial Hospital , which was destroyed by the tornado, was the first hospital in the United States to achieve carbon neutrality following its rebuilding in 2010.

The tornado greatly affected the economy and population of Greensburg as a whole; the amount of people residing in the town dropped from 1,574 in 2000 to 777 in 2010 as a direct result of the tornado. Greensburg still sees difficulty attracting residents due to the cost of homes in the area, although it has become a point of interest among eco-tourists visiting to see the "green town" built by the Federal Emergency Management Agency 's (FEMA) Long-term community recovery plan.

Climatological background [ edit ] Tornadoes are common in the state of Kansas, with an average of 87 tornadoes touching down in an average year. Kansas sees the second-highest number of tornadoes per state, only behind Texas , which sees 124 on average.

[ 4 ] Kansas is located in Tornado Alley , [ 5 ] the region of the United States in which the most tornadoes occur.

[ 6 ] Cold and dry air from the Rocky Mountains and the West Coast of the United States drops into Tornado Alley, while moist and dry subtropical air  is pulled inward from the Gulf of Mexico .

[ 7 ] The cold air pushes under the warm and moist air, pushing it upward; [ 7 ] this updraft causes the development of thunderstorms.

[ 8 ] Kansas has experienced seven F5 or EF5 tornadoes since 1950, the highest number recorded in any U.S. state.

[ 5 ] Kansas has an estimated 4.4 tornadoes per 100 square miles (260 km 2 ), the third-highest in the nation after Oklahoma and Florida .

[ 9 ] Meteorological synopsis [ edit ] Main article: Tornado outbreak of May 4–6, 2007 § Meteorological synopsis The most intense supercell thunderstorms developed in the early evening hours of May 4 across northwestern Oklahoma and southwestern Kansas. One of these eventually produced 20 to 22 tornadoes, including the Greensburg tornado and its respective satellites.

[ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] Multiple supercells first developed near the Kansas-Oklahoma border, to the south and southeast of Dodge City , at around 7:30 p.m..

[ 13 ] Over the next hour the cells combined into one large supercell near U.S. Route 183 .

[ 13 ] At around 8:30 p.m., storm spotters began reporting wall clouds , [ 14 ] with the first well-defined funnel clouds being observed around 8:45 p.m; small tornadoes touched down from that time to around 15 minutes later.

[ 15 ] At 9:25 p.m., a well-defined hook echo , a radar signature often indicative of a mesocyclone within a thunderstorm, was located in southern Kiowa County.

[ 16 ] This hook echo was accompanied by the Greensburg tornado, which touched down at 9:03 p.m. south of Greensburg.

[ 17 ] [ 18 ] Tornado summary [ edit ] The tornado warning, seen as a red polygon, that was issued for Greensburg prior to the tornado striking the town The National Weather Service issued advanced warnings of the tornado that were sent out to the public up to 39 minutes before the tornado hit Greensburg.

[ 19 ] The warning was upgraded to a rare tornado emergency 10 to 12 minutes before the tornado hit; storm chaser Lance Ferguson had relayed to the National Weather Service that a large tornado was on the ground near Greensburg.

[ 20 ] NBC News noted in a May 2007 publication that some Greensburg residents said the warnings saved their lives and that more people may have died had the warnings not been issued so far in advance, as the warnings gave time for residents to move to their shelters before the tornado destroyed the town.

[ 21 ] Jay Prater covered the storm for the KAKEland Television Network , [ 22 ] while Dave Freeman broadcast coverage on KSN .

[ 23 ] One survivor of the tornado stated that Freeman's coverage had saved his life, [ 23 ] and several survivors took shelter because of the broadcast. Freeman was praised for his live coverage of the event and as a result was named as the National Weather Association 's Broadcaster of the Year for 2008, [ 24 ] [ 25 ] his second time winning the award after receiving it in 1992.

[ 24 ] Formation and track towards Greensburg [ edit ] The rotating supercell that later produced the Greensburg tornado was accompanied by several short-tracked tornadoes.

[ 26 ] The Greensburg tornado itself, located on the westernmost side of the mesocyclone, began to rapidly strengthen, rapidly growing shortly after touching down at 9:03 p.m..

[ 27 ] [ 18 ] NOAA Weather Radio audio of the tornado warning that was issued for Kiowa County at 9:19 p.m.

[ 28 ] As the main tornado continued through rural areas, oil tanks were destroyed, with oil strewn across pastures and a road.

[ 29 ] The very large tornado continued to grow in size as it approached the city of Greensburg from the south. The tornado then reached its maximum width of 1.7 miles (2.7 km) as determined by damage.

[ 30 ] At 9:41 p.m., the National Weather Service office in Dodge City issued a tornado emergency for Greensburg, as indicated that "a violent tornado was on a direct path for portions of Greensburg … this is an emergency situation for Greensburg".

[ 31 ] Impact in Greensburg [ edit ] Reflectivity (left) and velocity (right) imagery taken by a NEXRAD radar of the tornado, indicated as a purple and later red triangle, approaching Greensburg from the south before dissipating. A distinct hook echo is visible in the reflectivity imagery. A second triangle to the northeast of Greensburg indicates an extremely large second tornado that moved through areas near Trousdale and received an EF3 rating.

The tornado weakened slightly as it entered residential areas in southern Greensburg, but remained violent as it directly impacted Delmer Day Elementary School, completely leveling a section of the building at EF4 intensity.

[ 32 ] Continuing north, downtown Greensburg was completely devastated by the tornado; the Greensburg City Hall and many other businesses suffered visible damage, [ 33 ] [ 34 ] including Fleener's Furniture Store, Dillon's Grocery Store and Sutton's True Value Hardware Store.

[ 35 ] A motel on the west side of town was severely damaged and vehicles were lofted and rolled by the tornado.

[ 36 ] A Daylight Donuts coffee shop and the local bank were heavily damaged or destroyed by the tornado.

[ 37 ] In addition, three schools were destroyed and electrical service to the city was cut by the tornado.

[ 38 ] A large grain elevator in the northern part of Greensburg remained standing after being hit by the tornado, one of a few structures to survive the event.

[ 39 ] The Greensburg meteorite was found and recovered near the Ellis Peck Farm east of Greensburg a few days afterwards.

[ 40 ] The Greensburg Mennonite Church was also destroyed.

[ 23 ] Trees throughout the town were completely stripped of all bark, the greatest number of debarked trees being located near homes that sustained EF4 damage.

[ 41 ] EF5 damage was determined to have been inflicted to seven residences throughout Greensburg proper.

[ 42 ] A damage survey conducted by Timothy P. Marshall , Joshua Wurman and several other experts found that a total of 53 homes were slid off of brick foundations that anchored the homes to the ground.

[ 43 ] 194 homes sustained EF0 damage; many of these homes were located along the outer path of the tornado on the east and west side of town.

[ 44 ] The survey also concluded that damage on the tornado's east side was more severe than damage of that on its west side.

[ 45 ] Damage to a home in Greensburg As the tornado exited the city limits of Greensburg, it began to weaken. It turned to the northwest, tracking in a counterclockwise circular direction; the tornado dissipated in a farm field to the northwest of Greensburg at 10:05 p.m.; it was on the ground for one hour and two minutes.

[ 18 ] [ 46 ] [ 47 ] Overall, 95% of Greensburg was destroyed.

[ 48 ] A total of 961 homes and businesses were destroyed, 216 received major damage and 307 received minor damage.

[ 49 ] The National Weather Service rated the worst of the damage caused by the tornado EF5 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale (EF scale), [ 18 ] which is used to rate and assess tornado damage.

[ 50 ] The tornado was the first to be rated EF5 on the EF scale after the retirement of the original Fujita scale in the United States on February 1, 2007; [ 51 ] [ 50 ] an EF5 rating is determined via a tornado damage survey .

[ 52 ] The tornado was described by meteorologist Howard Bluestein as "likely the most intense since the tornado that struck Oklahoma City and Moore, Oklahoma, on 3 May 1999".

[ 53 ] The Greensburg tornado was followed by multiple other tornadoes across Southern Kansas, although none struck populated areas and inflicted damage of the caliber seen in Greensburg.

[ 54 ] Satellite tornadoes [ edit ] During the early stages of the tornado's life, numerous videos and later research showed that at least five confirmed satellite tornadoes existed around the main tornado.

[ 55 ] Two of these satellites were anticyclonic tornadoes , [ 56 ] which rotate clockwise instead of the counter-clockwise motion that most tornadoes in the Northern Hemisphere exhibit.

[ 57 ] A University of Massachusetts team observing the storm using a mobile radar system detected five satellites that were determined to have been related to the Greensburg tornado.

[ 56 ] One of these satellite tornadoes likely crossed over the same damage path produced by the main tornado.

[ 58 ] The largest satellite tornado was located around 1.85 miles (3.0 km) southeast of the main tornado.

[ 59 ] List of confirmed satellites of the Greensburg tornado - May 4, 2007 [ 55 ] EF# Time (CDT) Path length Max width of path EF1 8:10 p.m.

~1.3 miles (2.1 kilometres) ~151 feet (46 metres) EF0 8:18 p.m.

~0.19 miles (0.31 kilometres) ~74 feet (23 metres) EF0 8:18 p.m.

~0.19 miles (0.31 kilometres) ~74 feet (23 metres) EF0 8:25 p.m.

~0.31 miles (0.50 kilometres) ~118 feet (36 metres) EF0 8:25 p.m.

~0.5 miles (0.80 kilometres) ~118 feet (36 metres) Aftermath [ edit ] Damage to downtown Greensburg a month after the tornado 95% of structures within the city limits of Greensburg sustained some degree of tornado-related damage.

[ 60 ] Around 800,000 cubic yards (610,000 m 3 ) of tornado-related debris was removed from Greensburg in the aftermath of the tornado.

[ 61 ] Initial recovery attempts in the days following the tornado were stunted by the disruption of electricity and other hazardous conditions that made it difficult to clean up the town.

[ 62 ] Then- President George W. Bush declared a disaster area in the state of Kansas.

[ 63 ] Immediately after the tornado, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) dispatched on-scene coordinators to Greensburg; the agency was tasked with addressing fuel releases and mitigating damaged transformers .

[ 64 ] The EPA left Greensburg in June 2007, a little over a month after the tornado, although it remained on standby.

[ 65 ] The population of Greensburg dropped from 1,574 residents in 2000 to 777 residents in 2010.

[ 66 ] The town's economy was still affected by the tornado ten years after the event; the town has seen trouble attracting residents because of homes being sold in Greensburg at a higher price than those of neighboring towns.

[ 67 ] 24 businesses were critically damaged by the tornado, and 110 were damaged beyond repair.

[ 68 ] 5.4.7 Arts Center [ edit ] The 5.4.7 Arts Center, seen in 2009 The 5.4.7 Arts Center, named after the date the tornado occurred, [ 69 ] [ 70 ] became the first sustainable LEED-platinum building in the state of Kansas and the first in history to be built by students following its opening on June 16th, 2008.

[ 71 ] [ 72 ] The building's wood siding was sourced from a World War II -era Sunflower Army Ammunition Plant in Eastern Kansas. During a 2010-2011 study by the United States Department of Energy , it was found that the building saved 70% in energy costs compared to another building of similar type.

[ 72 ] Delmer Day Elementary School and Greensburg High School [ edit ] The Greensburg High School, located around one block east of the tornado's inflow, was heavily damaged.

[ 73 ] As the tornado moved through the area, northward-facing winds battered the building, causing the top floor of the main building and the southern wall of an adjacent building to collapse inward. The east-facing walls of the high school also collapsed inward; the west-facing walls collapsed in an outward direction due to the movement of wind. In a damage survey conducted after the tornado, it was found that the building's large window sills anchored by hinge lines were unable to hold up against high winds, causing the collapse.

[ 74 ] Damage to the high school received an EF4 rating.

[ 75 ] EF4-rated damage to the Delmer Day Elementary School, located in southeastern Greensburg.

The Delmer Day Elementary School, located in the southeast portion of Greensburg, was the subject of an in-depth damage survey, which detailed how the school collapsed. Similarly to the Greensburg High School, strong winds initiated a collapse on the school's south and east-facing walls.

[ 76 ] A lack of steel vertical columns along the school's window sills, accompanied by weak hinge lines, was concluded to be the cause of the collapse. Like the high school, damage inflicted to the school was eventually given an EF4 rating.

[ 77 ] Both the Greensburg High School and Delmer Day Elementary School were heavily damaged to such an extent that they were no longer usable as public education facilities for Greensburg; school was canceled for the remainder of the calendar school year as a result.

[ 78 ] Schooling was temporarily done in Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)-provided trailers. Greensburg Schools superintendent Darin Headrick stated that "Our biggest concern was that if we didn't have a school in town as quickly as possible, people wouldn't have a reason to move back"; [ 79 ] a permanent countywide school began to serve Greensburg in 2010.

[ 79 ] Greensburg City Hall [ edit ] The Greensburg City Hall was rebuilt between 2008 and 2009, to LEED Platinum standards.

[ 80 ] The rebuilt building was constructed partially using salvaged bricks from a destroyed deisel-generator plant.

[ 81 ] The building is the only in Greensburg with an open-loop geothermal system, [ 80 ] which is a heat pump system that uses groundwater as the heat transfer fluid for a heat pump .

[ 82 ] Several other buildings in Greensburg used the closed-loop variant, which transfer heat by circulating fluid through a closed network of pipes. The open-loop system was chosen for the City Hall because it was the most affordable option.

[ 80 ] Greensburg High School [ edit ] EF4-rated damage to the Greensburg High School The Greensburg High School, located around one block east of the tornado's inflow, was heavily damaged.

[ 73 ] As the tornado moved through the area, northward-facing winds battered the building, causing the top floor of the main building and the southern wall of an adjacent building to collapse inward. The east-facing walls of the high school also collapsed inward; the west-facing walls collapsed in an outward direction due to the movement of wind. In a damage survey conducted after the tornado, it was found that the building's large window sills anchored by hinge lines were unable to hold up against high winds, causing the collapse.

[ 74 ] Damage to the high school received an EF4 rating.

[ 75 ] Kiowa County Courthouse and Sheriff's Office [ edit ] The Kiowa County Courthouse and Sheriff's House was one of only two buildings to have survived the tornado, [ 83 ] although it still suffered damage. While the option to tear down the structure did exist, Kiowa County chose to renovate the building to an LEED Gold standard.

[ 84 ] The renovated, three-story building features high-performance windows, spray foam insulation and a ground-source heat pump.

[ 84 ] Kiowa County Memorial Hospital [ edit ] Damage to the Kiowa County Memorial Hospital The Kiowa County Memorial Hospital was reinforced with internal vertical steel beams that extended along the floors and ceilings, along with double-thick masonry walls. Despite this, the hospital sustained heavy damage, and a 9,900-pound (4,500 kg) steel beam was lifted from the hospital's frame and lofted into a vehicle to the hospital's northeast. The damage survey conducted by structural engineers Timothy Marshall and other engineers concluded that winds of 147 mph (237 km/h) were needed to lift and toss the beam.

[ 85 ] The tornado also tore off the roof of the hospital, collapsed the walls of the building and scattered medical equipment around. Staff and patients in the structure took shelter in a basement and as a result were unharmed.

[ 86 ] The hospital was unable to functionally be used as a care facility as a result of the tornado. Workers on-site checked for victims in the facility, finding none, and a secondary care location was set up at the Heart to Heart International trailers in Olathe, Kansas. Recovery efforts began immediately following the tornado; workers at the Kiowa County Memorial Hospital decided to begin rebuilding the hospital within 24 hours of its destruction.

[ 87 ] S.D. Robinett Building [ edit ] The historic S. D. Robinett Building was the other of only two buildings in Greensburg to survive the tornado.

[ 83 ] Built in 1915, it was the only building in the downtown portion of Greensburg and one of two historic buildings in town that was deemed to have survived the tornado. The structure underwent a $124,653 rehabilitation, which included the installation of energy-efficient windows to replace windows broken in the tornado, and bamboo flooring . In addition, the brick parapet had to be rebuilt and damage to the building's interior needed to be addressed.

[ 88 ] The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 1, 2010, and the renovated building features an open floor plan, energy-efficient appliances and spray-foam insulation.

[ 89 ] Tornado Damage Investigation, Greensburg, Kansas [ edit ] Map of tornado damage in Greensburg produced from the survey The Federal Emergency Management Agency made two visits to Greensburg in May 2007, both following the tornado. During these visits, structural engineers with the URS Corporation conducted a damage survey separate from the one made by engineers with the Haag Company. The survey studied 46 residential structures in Greensburg that were damaged to varying degrees. The damage survey found that the worst tornado damage cut a 5-block wide swath through the center of Greensburg and that zero tornado shelters were located in Greensburg during the survey.

[ 77 ] [ 90 ] The survey also noted recommendations for the newly implemented Enhanced Fujita Scale, recommending that two new Degree of Damage (DOD) indicators be added to the list of 23 existing indicators to evaluate the scale of damage to load-bearing masonry buildings and timber-frame buildings, [ 91 ] although neither have been implemented as of August 2025.

[ 52 ] The UMass X-POL instrument (white radar dish, right) seen in 2009 during the VORTEX projects UMass X-Pol observations [ edit ] The UMass X-Pol (X-band, mobile, polarimetric Doppler radar) is an X band pulse-Doppler radar system with a 1.2-inch (3.0 cm) wavelength that is installed on a modified Ford F-350 pickup truck. The instrument was constructed at the Microwave Remote Sensing Laboratory at the University of Massachusetts (UMass) and has been used in several studies of tornadoes since 2003.

[ 92 ] [ 93 ] The observation aimed to document the early stages of the Greensburg tornado's life.

[ 94 ] The study was noted as being one of a few ever conducted to observe both an EF5-rated tornado and two separate storm modes, which refers to separate movement types of severe storms.

[ 95 ] Rebuilding efforts and reactions [ edit ] Temporary housing sites in Greensburg that were set up by FEMA in the immediate aftermath of the tornado, dubbed "Femaville" by some residents Following the tornado, many families signed up to reside in the 200 temporary housing units aligned in rows, [ 96 ] or "FEMA shelters" provided by FEMA, where residents lived for up to eighteen months.

[ 97 ] 500 of the 750 residents who remained in the town lived in these housing sites, dubbed "Femaville" by some residents of Greensburg. The temporary housing units came equipped with items like blankets and dishes to help living conditions while recovery efforts were underway.

[ 98 ] Schools and other public buildings in the neighboring towns of Mullinvile, Bucklin and Haviland were also used as temporary shelters for victims of the tornado.

[ 99 ] In addition to providing shelters, FEMA declared that it would pay for 100% of cleanup costs after the event, [ 100 ] including at least $7.6 million for housing assistance and almost $10 million for repairing infrastructure in the town.

[ 101 ] FEMA also hired 21 Greensburg residents to work in recovery positions; [ 102 ] 7,604 volunteers registered by AmeriCorps worked to help with recovery efforts.

[ 103 ] Volunteers logged a total of 57,786 volunteer hours.

[ 104 ] Then-President George W. Bush visited Greensburg twice following the tornado to survey damage.

[ 105 ] In a speech he made during his first visit to Greensburg, Bush said: "There is a lot of destruction. Fortunately, a lot of folks had basements here in this part of the world and lived to see another day. Unfortunately, too many died." [ 106 ] Almost 500 soldiers from the United States National Guard were deployed to Greensburg to aid with recovery efforts, and the crews provided machinery and communications for the area.

[ 107 ] In April 2009, then-U.S. representative Jerry Moran introduced the Greensburg, Kansas Recovery Extension Act to extend recovery funds through June 2010. The legislation died in committee and was never voted on by the House of Representatives .

[ 108 ] Long-term community recovery plan [ edit ] New wood-framed homes being constructed in Greensburg Shortly after the tornado, Kansas Governor Kathleen Sebelius stated that she wanted Greensburg to be "the greenest city in the state".

[ 109 ] FEMA activated the Long-term community recovery (LTCR) program, [ 110 ] which was designed to help recovery efforts in Greensburg over time.

[ 111 ] The United States Department of Energy (USDoE) collaborated with other agencies during the rebuilding process. The Greensburg Wind Farm was developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory , consisting of ten 1.25-megawatt wind turbines .

[ 112 ] One of the most critical issues that Greensburg residents pointed out was finding a way to return to their homes; [ 113 ] the LTCR prioritized rebuilding of housing units in Greensburg.

[ 114 ] The decline in population that Greensburg saw from 2007 to 2010 also heavily affected the town's economy, which the LTCR aimed to combat by preparing an Economic Development Strategy (EDS).

[ 115 ] The goal of the EDS was to not only boost Greensburg's economy, but to also encourage people to move to the town.

[ 116 ] The rebuilt "Big Well" museum in 2013 Along with changes to Greensburg's energy sources, the LTCR also required that all buildings built within the city limits of Greensburg meet Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Platinum certifications.

[ 117 ] [ 118 ] A tornado-resistant "silo home" built within Greensburg attracted attention after building of the structure completed in 2009; journalist Jennifer Goodman wrote in a September 2009 publication of Architect Magazine that "the tiny town in Kansas once ravaged by a tornado is drawing eco-tourists from all over the world … ". The publication also noted that 400 tourists from as far away as Europe visited Greensburg from July to September 2007 over a period of two months.

[ 119 ] Although the hand-dug, 109 feet (33 m)-deep Big Well was not destroyed, its respective water tower and an above-ground gift shop that were a centerpiece of the town's history was destroyed in the tornado.

[ 120 ] [ 121 ] [ 122 ] The original building was replaced with a circular structure that includes exhibits showcasing the town's history before and following the tornado; the museum reopened on May 26, 2012.

[ 123 ] Caitlin Matile, who was the tourism director and manager of Greensburg at the time of the museum's reopening, stated: "we do a very good job of displaying things … what it was, what it is now"; new stairs were added into the well to let visitors reach the bottom.

[ 123 ] The rebuilt Big Well Water Tower in May 2008 (left) and May 2010 (right). By 2010, the water tower was surrounded by rebuilt buildings.

Construction of a new water tower was put as a high-priority task because it was a crucial aspect of Greensburg's recovery.

[ 124 ] Professional Engineering Consultants (PEC) was tasked with designing the new tower, which was completed in 45 days; construction was completed by Maguire Iron in a span of 172 days.

[ 125 ] The water tower was declared complete in May 2008, after having its exterior coated with approximately 165 U.S. gallons (620 L) of Series 700 HydroFlon, a protective thermosetting fluoropolymer designed for use on water towers.

[ 126 ] The Kiowa County Memorial Hospital was the only building that was an exception to the LEED platinum requirement, although the hospital later garnered an LEED Platinum certification.

[ 117 ] [ 118 ] The new hospital opened in March 2010, at a cost of approximately $25 million (2010 USD) and at a different location in town.

[ 127 ] [ 117 ] [ 128 ] the Kiowa County Memorial hospital became the first in the United States to operate using carbon neutral energy .

[ 129 ] In 2012, the hospital became the first to use entrapped rainwater to run water-based utilities, such as toilets.

[ 130 ] The rebuilt hospital is equipped with fifteen beds, two trauma rooms and other rooms included in typical hospitals, [ 131 ] while using renewable energy to maintain safety and functionality standards.

[ 132 ] In addition, two 50-kilowatt wind turbines were installed on the site of the hospital to further reduce fossil fuel usage.

[ 133 ] County and state-level mitigation [ edit ] Kiowa County [ edit ] Greensburg (top,highlighted in red) is located in Kiowa County (bottom, highlighted in orange), which is located in the state of Kansas Due to Greensburg's size, the city did not have its own emergency services (ES agencies) at the time of the tornado; ES agencies were provided by Kiowa County.

[ 134 ] The county employed a part-time emergency manager who was responsible for the entire county's emergency plan in case of a disaster.

[ 135 ] Prior to the tornado, the county relied on an informational pamphlet from the 1990s as its emergency action plan; the pamphlet reportedly provided inadequate preparation in the event of a significant disaster.

[ 136 ] The pamphlet itself was lost during the tornado and was never located.

[ 137 ] State of Kansas [ edit ] The Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 required the state of Kansas to outline policies and requirements for cities regarding county and city-level mitigation.

[ 138 ] The plan, released in November 2004 and titled the Kansas Hazard Mitigation Plan (KMHP), stated that "mitigation be addressed in the required comprehensive emergency management plan developed by each county"; Kiowa County did not meet this requirement at the time and no punitive action was taken by the state of Kansas to enforce the requirement.

[ 139 ] Additionally, the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986 (EPCRA) led the state of Kansas to establish the Kansas Commission on Emergency Planning and Response (KCEPR), which was formed to ensure that the EPCRA was being followed.

[ 140 ] The KCEPR specifically focused on addressing emergencies involving hazardous industrial materials, [ 141 ] but later adopted local emergency planning committees to address community-level hazards.

[ 142 ] Casualties [ edit ] List of fatalities directly attributed to the tornado [ 143 ] Claude Hopkins, 79 Larry Hoskins, 51 David Lyon, 48 Colleen Panzer, 77 Ron Rediger, 57 Evelyn Kelly, 75 Sarah Tackett, 71 Beverly Volz, 52 Max McColm, 77 Richard Fry, 62 Harold Schmidt, 77 Tim Buckman, 46 [ 144 ] [ 145 ] Twelve people were killed by the tornado.

[ 146 ] [ 147 ] Ten of the fatalities occurred immediately during the tornado, and two others occurred later in hospitals as a result of tornadic injuries.

[ 148 ] One of the two in-hospital deaths was a police officer who was taken off life support while being treated for a tornado-induced head injury hours after the event at a hospital in Wichita.

[ 149 ] [ 150 ] A shelter in Mullenville established by residents following the tornado Approximately 90 people were taken to hospitals within the first day following the tornado. Greensburg's main hospital, the Kiowa County Memorial Hospital, was destroyed by the tornado; those who were injured had to be treated in several nearby cities with functional hospitals, including Dodge City , Pratt , Kinsley and Wichita .

[ 151 ] The Pratt Regional Medical Center in Pratt received the most tornado patients of any other hospital in the area, with 59 people being transferred to the facility for treatment.

[ 152 ] Six patients who were already being treated for unrelated injuries at the Kiowa County Memorial Hospital prior to the tornado were transferred to the Comanche County Hospital, although none sustained tornadic injuries.

[ 153 ] [ 154 ] A study carried out by the University of Kansas Health System in April 2013 concluded that the critical mortality rate , a measure of the number of deaths in a certain population, from the tornado was 18% and that age was related to the degree of injuries sustained from the tornado.

[ 155 ] Legacy [ edit ] Radar imagery of an EF3 tornado that prompted a tornado emergency for Greensburg on May 18, 2025 The tornado and its aftermath have been featured in two television series: Greensburg , which documents the aftermath of the tornado and the miniseries Build It Bigger: Rebuilding Greensbur g; the former series was created by actor Leonardo DiCaprio .

[ 156 ] Depictions of the event are also present in several pieces of literature, including The Greening of Oz by author Robert Fraga.

[ 156 ] In the book, Fraga writes: "The reconstruction is nearly complete, and it's a model for towns everywhere in this country. A new town has grown up out of the prairie with a spectacular collection of public buildings".

[ 156 ] Greensburg has seen numerous other tornadoes around its borders before and after the 2007 tornado. On May 22, 1923, an F3-rated tornado grazed the edge of town, injuring eight people and affecting 40 homes.

[ 157 ] On June 16, 1928, an F2 tornado tracked 40 miles (64 km) [ note 3 ] through areas west and south of Greensburg, injuring two people.

[ 158 ] In April 2012, a large EF3 tornado, described by the National Weather Service as "eerily similar to the Greensburg tornado", [ 159 ] developed west of Greensburg and moved towards Macksville , crossing over areas that had been hit during the 2007 tornado.

[ 159 ] On May 18, 2025, amid a destructive tornado outbreak across the region , a strong EF3 tornado moved through areas south and east of Greensburg, prompting a tornado emergency for the town.

[ 160 ] The tornado damaged the community of Brenham , although no fatalities or injuries were recorded.

[ 161 ] Television station KAKE described the tornado as "stirring up painful memories" of the 2007 tornado.
