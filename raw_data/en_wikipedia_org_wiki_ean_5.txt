The EAN-5 is a 5-digit European Article Number code, and is a supplement to the EAN -13 barcode used on books. It is used to give a suggestion for the price of the book.

The only difference is that the digits are separated by 01. The EAN-5 always begins with '01011.' Also, the R-Code is not used.

Encoding of the digits Digit L-code G-code 0 0001101 0100111 1 0011001 0110011 2 0010011 0011011 3 0111101 0100001 4 0100011 0011101 5 0110001 0111001 6 0101111 0000101 7 0111011 0010001 8 0110111 0001001 9 0001011 0010111 The structure of the barcode is based on the checksum . In order to compute the checksum, multiply each of the digits by either 3 or 9, alternating each time. Then add them and then do a mod 10. So the checksum for 05415 MN is 1 based on the following calculations: 0*3=0
    5*9=45
    4*3=12
    1*9=9
    5*3=15
  ----------
     81     %    10  = 1 Once you have the checksum digit, you can look up the structure in the following table. Note that the checksum digit is not in the final 5 digits, and is not intended to validate the 5 digit data, but rather to validate the reading of the EAN-5 overall.
