Sometimes for some reasons product spaces are equipped with 𝜎-algebra different than the product 𝜎-algebra. In these cases the projections need not be measurable at all.

The projected set of a measurable set is called analytic set and need not be a measurable set. However, in some cases, either relatively to the product 𝜎-algebra or relatively to some other 𝜎-algebra, projected set of measurable set is indeed measurable.

Henri Lebesgue himself, one of the founders of measure theory, was mistaken about that fact. In a paper from 1905 he wrote that the projection of Borel set in the plane onto the real line is again a Borel set.

[ 1 ] The mathematician Mikhail Yakovlevich Suslin found that error about ten years later, and his following research has led to descriptive set theory .

[ 2 ] The fundamental mistake of Lebesgue was to think that projection commutes with decreasing intersection, while there are simple counterexamples to that.

[ 3 ] Basic examples [ edit ] For an example of a non-measurable set with measurable projections , consider the space X := { 0 , 1 } {\displaystyle X:=\{0,1\}} with the 𝜎-algebra F := { ∅ ∅ , { 0 } , { 1 } , { 0 , 1 } } {\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}:=\{\varnothing ,\{0\},\{1\},\{0,1\}\}} and the space Y := { 0 , 1 } {\displaystyle Y:=\{0,1\}} with the 𝜎-algebra G := { ∅ ∅ , { 0 , 1 } } .

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}:=\{\varnothing ,\{0,1\}\}.} The diagonal set { ( 0 , 0 ) , ( 1 , 1 ) } ⊆ ⊆ X × × Y {\displaystyle \{(0,0),(1,1)\}\subseteq X\times Y} is not measurable relatively to F ⊗ ⊗ G , {\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}\otimes {\mathcal {G}},} although the both projections are measurable sets.

The common example for a non-measurable set which is a projection of a measurable set, is in Lebesgue 𝜎-algebra . Let L {\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}} be Lebesgue 𝜎-algebra of R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } and let L ′ {\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}'} be the Lebesgue 𝜎-algebra of R 2 .

{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{2}.} For any bounded N ⊆ ⊆ R {\displaystyle N\subseteq \mathbb {R} } not in L .

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}.} the set N × × { 0 } {\displaystyle N\times \{0\}} is in L ′ , {\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}',} since Lebesgue measure is complete and the product set is contained in a set of measure zero.

Still one can see that L ′ {\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}'} is not the product 𝜎-algebra L ⊗ ⊗ L {\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}\otimes {\mathcal {L}}} but its completion. As for such example in product 𝜎-algebra, one can take the space { 0 , 1 } R {\displaystyle \{0,1\}^{\mathbb {R} }} (or any product along a set with cardinality greater than continuum) with the product 𝜎-algebra F = ⨂ ⨂ t ∈ ∈ R F t {\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}=\textstyle {\bigotimes \limits _{t\in \mathbb {R} }}{\mathcal {F}}_{t}} where F t = { ∅ ∅ , { 0 } , { 1 } , { 0 , 1 } } {\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}_{t}=\{\varnothing ,\{0\},\{1\},\{0,1\}\}} for every t ∈ ∈ R .

{\displaystyle t\in \mathbb {R} .} In fact, in this case "most" of the projected sets are not measurable, since the cardinality of F {\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}} is ℵ ℵ 0 ⋅ ⋅ 2 ℵ ℵ 0 = 2 ℵ ℵ 0 , {\displaystyle \aleph _{0}\cdot 2^{\aleph _{0}}=2^{\aleph _{0}},} whereas the cardinality of the projected sets is 2 2 ℵ ℵ 0 .

{\displaystyle 2^{2^{\aleph _{0}}}.} There are also examples of Borel sets in the plane which their projection to the real line is not a Borel set, as Suslin showed.

[ 2 ] Measurable projection theorem [ edit ] The following theorem gives a sufficient condition for the projection of measurable sets to be measurable.

Let ( X , F ) {\displaystyle (X,{\mathcal {F}})} be a measurable space and let ( Y , B ) {\displaystyle (Y,{\mathcal {B}})} be a polish space where B {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}} is its Borel 𝜎-algebra. Then for every set in the product 𝜎-algebra F ⊗ ⊗ B , {\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}\otimes {\mathcal {B}},} the projected set onto X {\displaystyle X} is a universally measurable set relatively to F .

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}.} [ 4 ] An important special case of this theorem is that the projection of any Borel set of R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} onto R n − − k {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n-k}} where k < n {\displaystyle k<n} is Lebesgue-measurable, even though it is not necessarily a Borel set. In addition, it means that the former example of non-Lebesgue-measurable set of R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } which is a projection of some measurable set of R 2 , {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{2},} is the only sort of such example.
