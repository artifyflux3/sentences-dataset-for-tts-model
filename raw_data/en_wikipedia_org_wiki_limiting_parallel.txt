In neutral or absolute geometry , and in hyperbolic geometry , there may be many lines parallel to a given line l {\displaystyle l} through a point P {\displaystyle P} not on line R {\displaystyle R} ; however, in the plane, two parallels may be closer to l {\displaystyle l} than all others (one in each direction of R {\displaystyle R} ).

Thus it is useful to make a new definition concerning parallels in neutral geometry. If there are closest parallels to a given line they are known as the limiting parallel , asymptotic parallel or horoparallel (horo from Greek : ὅριον — border).

For rays , the relation of limiting parallel is an equivalence relation , which includes the equivalence relation of being coterminal.

If, in a hyperbolic triangle , the pairs of sides are limiting parallel, then the triangle is an ideal triangle .

Definition [ edit ] The ray Aa is a limiting parallel to Bb , written: A a | | | B b {\displaystyle Aa|||Bb} A ray A a {\displaystyle Aa} is a limiting parallel to a ray B b {\displaystyle Bb} if they are coterminal or if they lie on distinct lines not equal to the line A B {\displaystyle AB} , they do not meet, and every ray in the interior of the angle B A a {\displaystyle BAa} meets the ray B b {\displaystyle Bb} .

[ 1 ] Properties [ edit ] Distinct lines carrying limiting parallel rays do not meet.

Proof [ edit ] Suppose that the lines carrying distinct parallel rays met. By definition they cannot meet on the side of A B {\displaystyle AB} which either a {\displaystyle a} is on. Then they must meet on the side of A B {\displaystyle AB} opposite to a {\displaystyle a} , call this point C {\displaystyle C} . Thus ∠ ∠ C A B + ∠ ∠ C B A < 2 right angles ⇒ ⇒ ∠ ∠ a A B + ∠ ∠ b B A > 2 right angles {\displaystyle \angle CAB+\angle CBA<2{\text{ right angles}}\Rightarrow \angle aAB+\angle bBA>2{\text{ right angles}}} . Contradiction.
