Diagram showing the five primary layers of the Earth's atmosphere: exosphere, [thermosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermosphere "Thermosphere"), [mesosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesosphere "Mesosphere"), [stratosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratosphere "Stratosphere"), and [troposphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troposphere "Troposphere"). The layers are to scale. From the Earth's surface to the top of the stratosphere (50km) is just under 1% of Earth's radius.

The **exosphere** (;[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exosphere#cite_note-1) from [Ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_language "Ancient Greek language")[ἔξω](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E1%BC%94%CE%BE%CF%89#Ancient_Greek "wikt:ἔξω")_(\_éxō\_)_'outer, outside' and _-[sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere "Sphere")_) is a thin, atmosphere-like volume surrounding a [planet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet "Planet") or [natural satellite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_satellite "Natural satellite") where [molecules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule "Molecule") are gravitationally bound to that body, but where the density is so low that the molecules are essentially collision-less.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exosphere#cite_note-NASA-20150817-2) In the case of bodies with substantial atmospheres, such as [Earth's atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth "Atmosphere of Earth"), the exosphere is the uppermost layer, where the atmosphere thins out and merges with [outer space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_space "Outer space"). It is located directly above the [thermosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermosphere "Thermosphere"). Very little is known about it due to a lack of [research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research "Research"). [Mercury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(planet) "Mercury (planet)"), the [Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon "Moon"), [Ceres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceres_(dwarf_planet) "Ceres (dwarf planet)"), [Europa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europa_(moon) "Europa (moon)"), and [Ganymede](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganymede_(moon) "Ganymede (moon)") have surface boundary exospheres, which are exospheres without a denser atmosphere underneath. The Earth's exosphere is mostly [hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen "Hydrogen") and [helium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium "Helium"), with some heavier [atoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atoms "Atoms") and [molecules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecules "Molecules") near the base.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exosphere#cite_note-3)

Surface boundary exosphere
--------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Exosphere&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Surface boundary exosphere")]

[Mercury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(planet) "Mercury (planet)"), [Ceres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceres_(dwarf_planet) "Ceres (dwarf planet)") and several large natural satellites, such as the [Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon "Moon"), [Europa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europa_(moon) "Europa (moon)"), and [Ganymede](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganymede_(moon) "Ganymede (moon)"), have exospheres without a denser atmosphere underneath,[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exosphere#cite_note-NASA-20150306-4) referred to as a **surface boundary exosphere**.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exosphere#cite_note-5) Here, molecules are ejected on [elliptic trajectories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabolic_trajectory "Parabolic trajectory") until they collide with the surface. Smaller bodies such as asteroids, in which the molecules emitted from the surface escape to space, are not considered to have exospheres.

[![Image 2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Earth%E2%80%99s_geocorona_from_the_Moon.jpg/250px-Earth%E2%80%99s_geocorona_from_the_Moon.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Earth%E2%80%99s_geocorona_from_the_Moon.jpg)

The Earth and its hydrogen envelope of its exosphere, the [geocorona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocorona "Geocorona"), as seen from the Moon. This ultraviolet picture was taken in 1972 with a camera operated by [Apollo 16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_16 "Apollo 16") astronauts on the Moon.

The most common molecules within Earth's exosphere are those of the lightest atmospheric gases. [Hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen "Hydrogen") is present throughout the exosphere, with some [helium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium "Helium"), [carbon dioxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide "Carbon dioxide"),[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] and [atomic oxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_oxygen "Atomic oxygen") near its base. Because it can be hard to define the boundary between the exosphere and outer space, the exosphere may be considered a part of the [interplanetary medium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interplanetary_medium "Interplanetary medium") or [outer space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_space "Outer space").

Earth's exosphere produces Earth's [geocorona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocorona "Geocorona").

The lower boundary of the exosphere is called the _thermopause_ or _exobase_. It is also called the _critical altitude_, as this is the altitude where [barometric conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barometric_formula "Barometric formula") no longer apply. Atmospheric temperature becomes nearly a constant above this altitude.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exosphere#cite_note-6) On Earth, the altitude of the exobase ranges from about 500 to 1,000 [kilometres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilometre "Kilometre") (310 to 620[mi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mile "Mile")) depending on solar activity.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exosphere#cite_note-7)

The exobase can be defined in one of two ways:

If we define the exobase as the height at which upward-traveling molecules experience one collision on average, then at this position the [mean free path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_free_path "Mean free path") of a molecule is equal to one pressure [scale height](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_height "Scale height"). This is shown in the following. Consider a volume of air, with horizontal area ![Image 3: {\displaystyle A}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3) and height equal to the mean free path ![Image 4: {\displaystyle l}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/829091f745070b9eb97a80244129025440a1cfac), at pressure ![Image 5: {\displaystyle p}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/81eac1e205430d1f40810df36a0edffdc367af36) and temperature ![Image 6: {\displaystyle T}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ec7200acd984a1d3a3d7dc455e262fbe54f7f6e0). For an [ideal gas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_gas "Ideal gas"), the number of molecules contained in it is:

![Image 7: {\displaystyle N={\frac {pAl}{k_{B}T}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a9bcb8e12c2eb0c8074a304d442c255ef2ac039d)
where ![Image 8: {\displaystyle k_{B}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/70f38f7b73e53fd7b5d9ca64bec3a1438cc0eade) is the [Boltzmann constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_constant "Boltzmann constant"). From the requirement that each molecule traveling upward undergoes on average one collision, the pressure is:

![Image 9: {\displaystyle p={\frac {m_{A}Ng}{A}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8571faa3786b6721f8bf3aab6bdf6721e6cd70db)
where ![Image 10: {\displaystyle m_{A}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b38fd8717ed74667ad31b45948df4058db8ddb35) is the mean molecular mass of the gas. Solving these two equations gives:

![Image 11: {\displaystyle l={\frac {k_{B}T}{m_{A}g}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ff18288403523c150c56027ed364f49b66d9ed79)
which is the equation for the pressure scale height. As the pressure scale height is almost equal to the density scale height of the primary constituent, and because the [Knudsen number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knudsen_number "Knudsen number") is the ratio of mean free path and typical density fluctuation scale, this means that the exobase lies in the region where ![Image 12: {\displaystyle \mathrm {Kn} (h_{EB})\simeq 1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/30f9fcf6e204b1482b58caf041ecd132f6319a5f).

The fluctuation in the height of the exobase is important because this provides atmospheric drag on satellites, eventually causing them to fall from [orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit "Orbit") if no action is taken to maintain the orbit.

Earth's exosphere, [energetic neutral atoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energetic_neutral_atoms "Energetic neutral atoms") (ENA) and [magnetosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetosphere "Magnetosphere").

In principle, the exosphere covers distances where particles are still [gravitationally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity "Gravity") bound to [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth"), i.e. particles still have ballistic orbits that will take them back towards Earth. The upper boundary of the exosphere can be defined as the distance at which the influence of solar [radiation pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_pressure "Radiation pressure") on atomic [hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen "Hydrogen") exceeds that of Earth's gravitational pull. This happens at half the distance to the Moon or somewhere in the neighborhood of 200,000 kilometres (120,000 mi). The exosphere, observable from space as the [geocorona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocorona "Geocorona"), is seen to extend to at least 100,000 kilometres (62,000 mi) from Earth's surface.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exosphere#cite_note-8)

Exosphere of other celestial bodies
-----------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Exosphere&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Exosphere of other celestial bodies")]

If the atmosphere of a celestial body is very tenuous, like the [atmosphere of the Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_the_Moon "Atmosphere of the Moon") or [that of Mercury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Mercury "Atmosphere of Mercury"), the whole atmosphere is considered exosphere.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exosphere#cite_note-Showman_2014-9)

### The Exosphere of Mercury

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Exosphere&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: The Exosphere of Mercury")]

Many hypotheses exist about the formation of the surface boundary exosphere of [Mercury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(planet) "Mercury (planet)"), which has been noted to include elements such as [sodium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium "Sodium") (Na), [potassium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium "Potassium") (K), and [calcium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium "Calcium") (Ca).[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exosphere#cite_note-:0-10) Each material has been suggested as a result of processes such as impacts, solar wind, and [degassing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degassing "Degassing") from the terrestrial body that cause the atoms or molecules to form the planet's exosphere.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exosphere#cite_note-:0-10)

Meteoroids have been reported to commonly impact the surface of Mercury at speeds ranging up to 80 km/s, which are capable of causing vaporization of both the meteor and surface regolith upon contact.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exosphere#cite_note-:1-11) These expulsions can result in clouds of mixed materials due to the force of the impact, which are capable of transporting gaseous materials and compounds to Mercury's exosphere. During the impact, the former elements of the colliding bodies are mostly devolved into atoms rather than molecules that can then be reformed during a cooling, quenching process. Such materials have been observed as Na, NaOH, and O 2.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exosphere#cite_note-:1-11) However, it is theorized that, though different forms of sodium have been released into the Mercury exosphere via meteor impact, it is a small driver for the concentration of both sodium and potassium atoms overall.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exosphere#cite_note-:1-11) Calcium is more likely to be a result of impacts, though its transport is thought to be completed through [photolysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photodissociation "Photodissociation") of its former oxides or hydroxides rather than atoms released during the moment of impact such as sodium, potassium, and [iron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron "Iron") (Fe).[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exosphere#cite_note-:1-11)

Another possible method of the exosphere formation of Mercury is due to its unique [magnetosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetosphere "Magnetosphere") and [solar wind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_wind "Solar wind") relationship. The magnetosphere of this celestial body is hypothesized to be an incomplete shield from the weathering of solar wind. If accurate, there are openings in the magnetosphere in which solar wind is able to surpass the magnetosphere, reach the body of Mercury, and [sputter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputtering "Sputtering") the components of the surface that become possible sources of material in the exosphere.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exosphere#cite_note-12)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exosphere#cite_note-:2-13) The weathering is capable of eroding the elements, such as sodium, and transporting them to the atmosphere. However, this occurrence is not constant, and it is unable to account for all atoms or molecules of the exosphere.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exosphere#cite_note-:2-13)
