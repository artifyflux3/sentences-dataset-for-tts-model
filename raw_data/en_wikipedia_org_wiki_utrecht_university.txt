Established 26 March 1636 (389 years ago) ( 1636-03-26 ) , it is one of the oldest universities in the Netherlands. In 2023, it had an enrollment of 39,769 students, and employed 8,929 faculty members and staff.

[ 4 ] More than 400 PhD degrees were awarded and 7,765 scientific articles were published. The university's 2023 budget was €2.8 billion, consisting of €1.157 billion for the university [ 4 ] (income from work commissioned by third parties is 319 million euros) and €1.643 billion for the University Medical Center Utrecht .

[ 6 ] The university's interdisciplinary research targets life sciences, pathways to sustainability, dynamics of youth, and institutions for open societies. Utrecht University is led by the University Board, consisting of Wilco Hazeleger ( Rector Magnificus ), Anton Pijpers (chair), Margot van der Starre (Vice Chair) and Niels Vreeswijk (Student Assessor). Close ties are harboured with other institutions internationally through its membership in the Coimbra Group (CG), the League of European Research Universities (LERU), the Utrecht Network and the European University Association (EUA).

History [ edit ] Gable decoration at the University Hall building ( Academiegebouw [ nl ] ).

Bernardus Schotanus, the university's first rector magnificus , and professor of law and mathematics Utrecht University was founded on 26 March 1636.

[ 7 ] It has its roots in the Illustrious School of Utrecht, which founded two years earlier in 1634 before being elevated to the status of university in 1636. The influential professor of theology Gisbertus Voetius delivered the inaugural speech, and Bernardus Schotanus (professor of law and mathematics) became the university's first rector magnificus .

Anna Maria van Schurman , who became the university's first female student, was invited to write a Latin poem for the inauguration.

[ 8 ] Initially, only a few dozen students attended classes at the university. Seven professors worked in four faculties: philosophy, which offered all students an introductory education, and three higher-level faculties (theology, medicine and law).

Utrecht University flourished in the seventeenth century, and contributed significantly to the Dutch Golden Age , despite competition with the older universities, such as Leiden (1575) and Groningen (1614). Leiden, in particular, proved a strong competitor and made further improvement necessary; a rivalry that persists to this day. A botanical garden was built on the grounds of the present Sonnenborgh Observatory , and three years later the Smeetoren added an astronomical observatory. The university attracted many students from abroad (especially from Germany, England and Scotland). They witnessed the intellectual and theological battle fought between proponents of the new philosophy ( René Descartes lived for a few years in Utrecht) and proponents of the strict Reformed theologian Voetius . They also witnessed the teachings of renowned Dutch jurist, Johannes Voet , a university alumnus and professor of law, whose works remain highly authoritative in modern Roman-Dutch law .

An honorary doctorate in law was conferred on Eleanor Roosevelt in 1948.

In 1806, the French occupying authorities of the Netherlands downgraded Utrecht University to an école secondaire (high school), but after the establishment of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1813 it regained its former status.

[ 7 ] Leiden, Leuven , Groningen, Utrecht and Ghent were the five universities ( Dutch : hoge scholen ) of the new state. Two of the universities (Leuven and Ghent) became part of the new Belgian state after their respective provinces separated from the United Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1830. As a result, Utrecht University remained one of only three Dutch universities. During the French occupation, King Louis Napoleon ordered the construction of a palace in the centre of Utrecht, which eventually became the University Library City Centre.

[ 7 ] Utrecht University played a prominent role in the golden age of Dutch science. Around 1850 the "Utrechtian School" of science formed, with Pieter Harting , Gerardus J. Mulder , Christophorus H. D. Buys Ballot and Franciscus Donders among the leading scientists. They introduced the educational laboratory ( onderwijslaboratorium ) as a practical learning place for their students. The National Veterinary School ( Dutch : Rijks Veeartsenijschool ) became Utrecht University's Faculty of Veterinary Medicine in 1918.

As the university grew, the academic buildings in the historic city centre were unable to meet the university's increasing need for space. Therefore, starting from the 1960s, a significant part of the university moved to the De Uithof campus, which occupies the easternmost part of the city and is located south of De Bilt . However, the university continued to retain its academic buildings and presence in the historic city centre.

The university is represented in the Stichting Academisch Erfgoed , a foundation with the goal of preserving the university's heritage and collections.

Organisation [ edit ] Utrecht University Hall ( Academiegebouw [ nl ] ), built in 1894 The university consists of seven faculties , which offer 58 undergraduate degree programmes and over 150 graduate programmes.

The other five faculties and most of the administrative services are located in Utrecht Science Park De Uithof , a campus area on the outskirts of the city. University College Utrecht, along with the Utrecht School of Economics, are situated in the former Kromhout Kazerne, which used to be a Dutch military base. University College Roosevelt is located off-campus in the city of Middelburg in the south-west of the Netherlands.
