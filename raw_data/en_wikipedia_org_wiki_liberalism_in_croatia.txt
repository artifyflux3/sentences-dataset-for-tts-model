Liberals became active since 1860 in Dalmatia and since 1904 in the rest of Croatia. It never became a major political party. It is limited to liberal parties with substantial support, mainly proved by having had a representation in parliament. The sign ⇒ denotes another party in that scheme. For inclusion in this scheme it isn't necessary so that parties labeled themselves as a liberal party.

History [ edit ] After the restoration of democracy in 1989 liberalism became very divided.

Reformists and GLAS are formed from dissidents of the Croatian People's Party-Liberal Democrats.

Istrian Democratic Assembly ( Istarski demokratski sabor - Dieta Democratica Istriana , member of ALDE ) is considered as Istrian regionalist , but also as a liberal party. In the 2020 Croatian parliamentary election two additional liberal parties emerged as factors on the national scene: Centre and Focus , both members of ALDE.
