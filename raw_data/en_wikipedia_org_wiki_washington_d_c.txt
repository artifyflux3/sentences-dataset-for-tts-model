, officially the District of Columbia and commonly known as simply Washington or D.C.

, is the capital city and federal district [ a ] of the United States . The city is on the Potomac River , across from Virginia , and shares land borders with Maryland to its north and east. It was named after George Washington , the first president of the United States . The district is named for Columbia , the female personification of the nation .

The U.S. Constitution in 1789 called for the creation of a federal district under exclusive jurisdiction of the U.S. Congress . As such, Washington, D.C., is not part of any state , and is not one itself. The Residence Act , adopted on July 16, 1790, approved the creation of the capital district along the Potomac River. The city was founded in 1791, and the 6th Congress held the first session in the unfinished Capitol Building in 1800 after the capital moved from Philadelphia . In 1801, the District of Columbia, formerly part of Maryland and Virginia and including the existing settlements of Georgetown and Alexandria , was officially recognized as the federal district; initially, the city was a separate settlement within the larger district. In 1846, Congress reduced the size of the district when it returned the land originally ceded by Virginia , including the city of Alexandria. In 1871, it created a single municipality for the district. There have been several unsuccessful efforts to make the district into a state since the 1880s, including a statehood bill that passed the House of Representatives in 2021 but was not adopted by the U.S. Senate .

Designed in 1791 by Pierre Charles L'Enfant , the city is divided into quadrants , which are centered on the Capitol Building and include 131 neighborhoods . As of the 2020 census , the city had a population of 689,545.

[ 3 ] Commuters from the city's Maryland and Virginia suburbs raise the city's daytime population to more than one million during the workweek.

[ 12 ] The Washington metropolitan area , which includes parts of Maryland, Virginia, and West Virginia , is the country's seventh-largest metropolitan area , with a 2023 population of 6.3 million residents.

[ 6 ] A locally elected mayor and 13-member council have governed the district since 1973, though Congress retains the power to overturn local laws. Washington, D.C., residents do not have voting representation in Congress, but elect a single non-voting congressional delegate to the U.S. House of Representatives. The city's voters choose three presidential electors in accordance with the Twenty-third Amendment , passed in 1961.

Washington, D.C., anchors the southern end of the Northeast megalopolis . As the seat of the U.S. federal government , the city is an important world political capital .

[ 13 ] The city hosts buildings that house federal government headquarters, including the White House , U.S. Capitol, Supreme Court Building , and multiple federal departments and agencies . The city is home to many national monuments and museums , located most prominently on or around the National Mall, including the Jefferson Memorial , Lincoln Memorial , and Washington Monument . It hosts 177 foreign embassies and the global headquarters of the World Bank , International Monetary Fund , Organization of American States , and other international organizations. Home to many of the nation's largest industry associations, non-profit organizations, and think tanks , the city is known as a lobbying hub, which is centered on and around K Street .

[ 14 ] It is also among the country's top tourist destinations; in 2022, it drew an estimated 20.7 million domestic [ 15 ] and 1.2 million international visitors, seventh-most among U.S. cities.

[ 16 ] History Main article: History of Washington, D.C.

For a chronological guide, see Timeline of Washington, D.C.

The Algonquian -speaking Piscataway people inhabited present-day Washington, D.C. and lands around the Potomac River when Europeans first arrived and colonized the region in the early 17th century. The Nacotchtank , also called the Nacostines by Catholic missionaries , maintained settlements around the Anacostia River in present-day Washington, D.C. Conflicts with European colonists and neighboring tribes ultimately displaced the Piscataway people, some of whom established a new settlement in 1699 near Point of Rocks, Maryland .

[ 17 ] Founding In 1800, the United States Congress began assembling in the new United States Capitol after the nation's capital was moved from Philadelphia , which served as the capital during the American Revolution and again from 1790 to 1800.

During the American Revolution and Revolutionary War , nine cities served as capitals to the Continental Congress and under the Articles of Confederation . Following independence, New York City served briefly as the first capital following adoption of the Constitution before the capital returned to Philadelphia , where it remained from 1790 to 1800.

[ 18 ] On October 6, 1783, after the Pennsylvania Mutiny of 1783 forced the capital to move briefly from Philadelphia to present-day Princeton University in Princeton, New Jersey , Congress resolved to consider a new location for it.

[ 19 ] The following day, Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts moved "that buildings for the use of Congress be erected on the banks of the Delaware near Trenton , or of the Potomac , near Georgetown , provided a suitable district can be procured on one of the rivers as aforesaid, for a federal town".

[ 20 ] In Federalist No. 43 , published January 23, 1788, James Madison argued that the new federal government would need authority over a national capital to provide for its own maintenance and safety.

[ 21 ] The Pennsylvania Mutiny of 1783 emphasized the need for the national government to not rely on any state for its own security.

[ 22 ] : 66 Article One, Section Eight of the Constitution permits the establishment of a "District (not exceeding ten miles square) as may, by cession of particular states, and the acceptance of Congress, become the seat of the government of the United States".

[ 23 ] The constitution, however, does not specify a location for the capital. In the Compromise of 1790 , Madison, Alexander Hamilton , and Thomas Jefferson agreed that the federal government would pay each state's remaining Revolutionary War debts in exchange for establishing the new national capital in the Southern United States .

[ 22 ] : 124–127 [ b ] On July 9, 1790, Congress passed the Residence Act , which approved creating a national capital on the Potomac River . Under the Residence Act, the exact location was to be selected by President George Washington , who signed the bill into law on July 16, 1790. Formed from land donated by Maryland and Virginia, the initial shape of the federal district was a square measuring 10 miles (16 km) on each side and totaling 100 square miles (259 km 2 ).

[ 22 ] : 89–92 [ c ] Two pre-existing settlements were included in the territory, the port of Georgetown , founded in 1751, [ 24 ] and the port city of Alexandria, Virginia , founded in 1749.

[ 25 ] In 1791 and 1792, a team led by Andrew Ellicott , including Ellicott's brothers Joseph and Benjamin and African American astronomer Benjamin Banneker , whose parents had been enslaved, surveyed the borders of the federal district and placed boundary stones at every mile point; many of these stones are still standing.

[ 26 ] [ 27 ] Both Maryland and Virginia were slave states , and slavery existed in the District from its founding. The building of Washington likely relied in significant part on slave labor, and slave receipts have been found for the White House, Capitol Building, and establishment of Georgetown University . The city became an important slave market and a center of the nation's internal slave trade .

[ 28 ] [ 29 ] After its survey, the new federal city was constructed on the north bank of the Potomac River, east of Georgetown and centered on Capitol Hill . On September 9, 1791, three commissioners overseeing the capital's construction named the city in honor of President Washington. At the same time, the federal district was named Columbia, [ 22 ] : 101 a feminine form of Columbus , which was a poetic name for the United States commonly used at the time.

[ 30 ] Congress held its first session there on November 17, 1800.

[ 31 ] Congress passed the District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801 , which officially organized the district and placed the entire territory under the exclusive control of the federal government. The area within the district was organized into two counties, the County of Washington to the east and north of the Potomac River and the County of Alexandria to the west and south.

[ 22 ] : 717 After the Act's passage, citizens in the district were no longer considered residents of Maryland or Virginia, and their representation in Congress ended.

[ 32 ] Burning during War of 1812 Main article: Burning of Washington After their victory at the Battle of Bladensburg in 1814, the British Army burned the White House and other buildings during a one-day occupation of Washington, D.C.

On August 24, 1814, during the War of 1812 , British forces invaded and occupied the city after defeating an American force in the war's Battle of Bladensburg . In retaliation for acts of destruction by American troops in the Canadas , British troops set fire to government buildings in the city, gutting the U.S. Capitol , the Treasury Building , and White House in what became known as the burning of Washington . The damage of the city's burning could have been more extensive, but a storm forced the British to evacuate the city after just 24 hours.

[ 33 ] Most government buildings were repaired quickly, but the Capitol, which was then still under construction, was not completed in its current form until 1868.

[ 34 ] Retrocession and the Civil War Main articles: District of Columbia retrocession and Washington, D.C., in the American Civil War The U.S. Capitol dome was under construction during Lincoln's first inauguration on March 4, 1861, five weeks before the start of the American Civil War .

In the 1830s, the district's southern territory of Alexandria declined economically, due in part to its neglect by Congress.

[ 35 ] Alexandria was a major market in the domestic slave trade and pro-slavery residents feared that abolitionists in Congress would end slavery in the district . Alexandria's citizens petitioned Virginia to retake the land it had donated to form the district, a process known as retrocession .

[ 36 ] The Virginia General Assembly voted in February 1846, to accept the return of Alexandria. On July 9, 1846, Congress went further, agreeing to return all territory that Virginia had ceded to the district during its formation. This left the district's area consisting only of the portion originally donated by Maryland.

[ 35 ] Confirming the fears of pro-slavery Alexandrians, the Compromise of 1850 outlawed the slave trade in the district, although not slavery itself.

[ 37 ] The outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861 led to the expansion of the federal government and notable growth in the city's population, including a large influx of freed slaves.

[ 38 ] President Abraham Lincoln signed the Compensated Emancipation Act in 1862, which ended slavery in the district, freeing about 3,100 slaves in the district nine months before the Emancipation Proclamation .

[ 39 ] In 1868, Congress granted the district's African American male residents the right to vote in municipal elections.

[ 38 ] Growth and redevelopment See also: City Beautiful movement The Eisenhower Executive Office Building , built between 1871 and 1888, was the world's largest office building until 1943, when it was surpassed by The Pentagon .

By 1870, the district's population had grown 75% in a decade to nearly 132,000 people, [ 40 ] yet the city still lacked paved roads and basic sanitation. Some members of Congress suggested moving the capital farther west, but President Ulysses S. Grant refused to consider the proposal.

[ 41 ] In the Organic Act of 1871 , Congress repealed the individual charters of the cities of Washington and Georgetown , abolished Washington County , and created a new territorial government for the whole District of Columbia.

[ 42 ] These steps made "the city of Washington...legally indistinguishable from the District of Columbia." [ 43 ] In 1873, President Grant appointed Alexander Robey Shepherd as Governor of the District of Columbia. Shepherd authorized large projects that modernized the city but bankrupted its government. In 1874, Congress replaced the territorial government with an appointed three-member board of commissioners.

[ 44 ] In 1888, the city's first motorized streetcars began service. Their introduction generated growth in areas of the district beyond the City of Washington's original boundaries, leading to an expansion of the district over the next few decades.

[ 45 ] Georgetown's street grid and other administrative details were formally merged with those of the City of Washington in 1895.

[ 46 ] However, the city had poor housing and strained public works, leading it to become the first city in the nation to undergo urban renewal projects as part of the City Beautiful movement in the early 20th century.

[ 47 ] The City Beautiful movement built heavily upon the already-implemented L'Enfant Plan , with the new McMillan Plan leading urban development in the city throughout the movement. Much of the old Victorian Mall was replaced with modern Neoclassical and Beaux-Arts architecture ; these designs are still prevalent in the city's governmental buildings today.

Increased federal spending under the New Deal in the 1930s led to the construction of new government buildings, memorials, and museums in the district, [ 48 ] though the chairman of the House Subcommittee on District Appropriations, Ross A. Collins of Mississippi , justified cuts to funds for welfare and education for local residents by saying that "my constituents wouldn't stand for spending money on niggers." [ 49 ] World War II led to an expansion of federal employees in the city; [ 50 ] by 1950, the district's population reached its peak of 802,178 residents.

[ 40 ] Civil rights and home rule era See also: 1968 Washington, D.C., riots and District of Columbia home rule The March on Washington at the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool on August 28, 1963 The Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution was ratified in 1961, granting the district three votes in the Electoral College for the election of president and vice president, but still not affording the city's residents representation in Congress.

[ 51 ] After the assassination of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.

on April 4, 1968, riots broke out in the city , primarily in the U Street, 14th Street, 7th Street, and H Street corridors, which were predominantly black residential and commercial areas. The riots raged for three days until more than 13,600 federal troops and Washington, D.C., Army National Guardsmen stopped the violence. Many stores and other buildings were burned, and rebuilding from the riots was not completed until the late 1990s.

[ 52 ] In 1973, Congress enacted the District of Columbia Home Rule Act providing for an elected mayor and 13-member council for the district.

[ 53 ] In 1975, Walter Washington became the district's first elected and first black mayor.

[ 54 ] Statehood movement Main article: District of Columbia statehood movement Since the 1980s, the D.C. statehood movement has grown in prominence. In 2016, a referendum on D.C. statehood resulted in an 85% support among Washington, D.C., voters for it to become the nation's 51st state . In March 2017, the city's congressional delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton introduced a bill for statehood. Reintroduced in 2019 and 2021 as the Washington, D.C., Admission Act , the U.S. House of Representatives passed it in April 2021.

[ 55 ] After not progressing in the Senate, the statehood bill was introduced again in January 2023.

[ 56 ] The bill would have made D.C. into a state with one representative and two senators, with the name Washington, Douglass Commonwealth (thus keeping the same abbreviation Washington, D.C.).

[ 57 ] The legalities, reasons, and impact of statehood have been heavily debated in the 2020s.

[ 58 ] Geography Main article: Geography of Washington, D.C.

The Washington Monument viewed from the Tidal Basin during the National Cherry Blossom Festival in April 2018 Washington, D.C. is located on the north side of the Potomac River . It is bordered on three sides by Maryland and by Northern Virginia to its southwest.

Washington, D.C., is located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the U.S. East Coast . The city has a total area of 68.34 square miles (177 km 2 ), of which 61.05 square miles (158.1 km 2 ) is land and 7.29 square miles (18.9 km 2 ) (10.67%) is water.

The U.S. Capitol during the February 5–6, 2010 North American blizzard Washington's climate is temperate humid subtropical ( Köppen : Cfa ).

[ 84 ] [ 85 ] [ unreliable source?

] Winters are cool to cold with some snow of varying intensity, while summers are hot and humid. The district is in plant hardiness zone 8a near downtown, and zone 7b elsewhere in the city.

[ 86 ] [ 87 ] Summers are hot and humid with a July daily average of 79.8 °F (26.6 °C) and average daily relative humidity around 66%, which can cause moderate personal discomfort. Heat indices regularly approach 100 °F (38 °C) at the height of summer.

[ 88 ] The combination of heat and humidity in the summer brings very frequent thunderstorms, some of which occasionally produce tornadoes in the area.

[ 89 ] Blizzards affect Washington once every four to six years on average. The most violent storms, known as nor'easters , often impact large regions of the East Coast .

[ 90 ] From January 27 to 28, 1922 , the city officially received 28 inches (71 cm) of snowfall, the largest snowstorm since official measurements began in 1885.

[ 91 ] According to notes kept at the time, the city received between 30 and 36 inches (76 and 91 cm) from a snowstorm in January 1772.

[ 92 ] [ unreliable source?

The L'Enfant Plan for the city, developed in 1791 by Pierre Charles L'Enfant In 1830, the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal was extended to Georgetown .

An aerial view of Northwest Washington, D.C.

in June 2018 Washington, D.C., was a planned city , and many of the city's street grids were developed in that initial plan. In 1791, President George Washington commissioned Pierre Charles L'Enfant , a French-born military engineer and artist, to design the new capital. He enlisted the help of Isaac Roberdeau, Étienne Sulpice Hallet and Scottish surveyor Alexander Ralston to help lay out the city plan.

[ 103 ] The L'Enfant Plan featured broad streets and avenues radiating out from rectangles, providing room for open space and landscaping.

[ 104 ] L'Enfant was also provided a roll of maps by Thomas Jefferson depicting Frankfurt, Amsterdam, Strasbourg, Paris, Orleans, Bordeaux, Lyon, Marseille, Turin, and Milan.

[ 105 ] L'Enfant's design also envisioned a garden-lined grand avenue about 1 mile (1.6 km) long and 400 feet (120 m) wide in an area that is now the National Mall inspired by the grounds at Versailles and Tuileries Gardens.

[ 106 ] In March 1792, President Washington dismissed L'Enfant due to conflicts with the three commissioners appointed to supervise the capital's construction.

Andrew Ellicott , who worked with L'Enfant in surveying the city, was then tasked with completing its design. Though Ellicott revised the original L'Enfant plans, including changing some street patterns, L'Enfant is still credited with the city's overall design.

[ 22 ] : 101–103 By the early 20th century, however, L'Enfant's vision of a grand national capital was marred by slums and randomly placed buildings in the city, including a railroad station on National Mall. Congress formed a special committee charged with beautifying Washington's ceremonial core.

[ 47 ] What became known as the McMillan Plan was finalized in 1901 and included landscaping the Capitol grounds and National Mall, clearing slums, and establishing a new citywide park system. The plan is thought to have largely preserved L'Enfant's intended design for the city.

[ 104 ] By law, the city's skyline is low and sprawling. The federal Height of Buildings Act of 1910 limits building height based on the width of the adjacent street, with maxima of 90 feet (27 m) on residential streets and 130 feet (40 m) on commercial ones.

[ 107 ] [ 108 ] Despite popular belief, no law has ever limited buildings to the height of the United States Capitol or the 555-foot (169 m) Washington Monument , [ 68 ] which remains the district's tallest structure. City leaders have cited the height restriction as a primary reason that the district has limited affordable housing and its metro area has suburban sprawl and traffic problems.

[ 107 ] Washington, D.C., is divided into four quadrants of unequal area: Northwest (NW) , Northeast (NE) , Southeast (SE) , and Southwest (SW) . The axes bounding the quadrants radiate from the U.S. Capitol.

[ 109 ] All road names include the quadrant abbreviation to indicate their location. House numbers generally correspond with the number of blocks away from the Capitol. Most streets are set out in a grid pattern with east–west streets named with letters (e.g., C Street SW), north–south streets with numbers (e.g., 4th Street NW), and diagonal avenues, many of which are named after states .

[ 109 ] The City of Washington was bordered on the north by Boundary Street (renamed Florida Avenue in 1890), Rock Creek to the west, and the Anacostia River to the east.

[ 45 ] [ 104 ] Washington, D.C.'s street grid was extended, where possible, throughout the district starting in 1888.

[ 110 ] Georgetown's streets were renamed in 1895.

[ 46 ] Some streets are particularly noteworthy, including Pennsylvania Avenue , which connects the White House to the Capitol; and K Street, which houses the offices of many lobbying groups.

[ 111 ] Constitution Avenue and Independence Avenue , located on the north and south sides of National Mall, respectively, are home to many of Washington's iconic museums, including many Smithsonian Institution buildings and the National Archives Building . Washington hosts 177 foreign embassies ; these maintain nearly 300 buildings and more than 1,600 residential properties, many of which are on a section of Massachusetts Avenue informally known as Embassy Row .

[ 118 ] The interior of the Washington Metro stations and the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden are designed with strong influence from the 20th-century Brutalism movement.

[ 119 ] The Smithsonian Institution Building is built of Seneca red sandstone in the Norman Revival style.

[ 120 ] The Old Post Office building, located on Pennsylvania Avenue and completed in 1899, was the first building in the city to have a steel frame structure and the first to use electrical wiring in its design.

[ 121 ] Notable contemporary residential buildings, restaurants, shops, and office buildings in the city include the Wharf on the Southwest Waterfront , Navy Yard along the Anacostia River , and CityCenterDC in Downtown .

[ 125 ] Georgetown 's Old Stone House , built in 1765, is the oldest-standing building in the city.

[ 126 ] Founded in 1789, Georgetown University features a mix of Romanesque and Gothic Revival architecture .

[ 114 ] The Ronald Reagan Building is the largest building in the district with a total area of about 3.1 million square feet (288,000 m 2 ).

[ 127 ] Washington Union Station is designed in a combination of architectural styles. Its Great Hall has elaborate gold leaf designs along the ceilings and the hall includes several decorative classical-style statues.

Since 1961, the city's residents can vote for the U.S. president and vice president , who also serves as President of the Senate .

The Abraham Lincoln Statue at the Lincoln Memorial in September 2016 Washington, D.C. is not a state and therefore has no federal voting representation in Congress . The city's residents elect a non-voting delegate to the House of Representatives ( D.C. at-large ), who may sit on committees, participate in debate, and introduce legislation, but cannot vote on the House floor . The district has no official representation in the United States Senate . Neither chamber seats the district's elected "shadow" representative or senators .

[ 286 ] The District was granted presidential voting rights by the 23rd Amendment in 1961.

[ 287 ] The 23rd Amendment was ratified which granted the people of the Washington, D.C., the right to vote for the president. This was done by giving them electoral college votes they would get if they were a state, but it must be no more than the least a state has; this works out to three electoral college votes. The amendment reads, ".. A number of electors of President and Vice President equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives in Congress to which the District would be entitled if it were a State, but in no event more than the least populous State".

[ 288 ] The 23rd Amendment could complicate statehood, because it would apply even if the federal district was shrunk, and undoing the amendment requires another amendment.

[ 58 ] Congress must operate from a district it controls, but it can be no larger than ten miles on a side; the 2021 statehood bill got around this by proposing the federal district be shrunk to an area roughly the size of the national mall.

Pennsylvania Avenue , one of the city's most prominent streets, connects the U.S. Capitol and White House .

There are 1,500 miles (2,400 km) of streets, parkways, and avenues in the district.

[ 319 ] Due to the freeway revolts of the 1960s, much of the proposed interstate highway system through the middle of Washington was never built.

Interstate 95 (I-95), the nation's major east coast highway, therefore bends around the district to form the eastern portion of the Capital Beltway . A portion of the proposed highway funding was directed to the region's public transportation infrastructure instead.

[ 320 ] The interstate highways that continue into Washington, including I-66 and I-395 , both terminate shortly after entering the city.

[ 321 ] According to a 2010 study, Washington-area commuters spent 70 hours a year in traffic delays, which tied with Chicago for having the nation's worst road congestion.

[ 322 ] However, 37% of Washington-area commuters take public transportation to work, the second-highest rate in the country.

[ 323 ] An additional 12% of D.C. commuters walked to work, 6% carpooled, and 3% traveled by bicycle in 2010.

[ 324 ] Cycling A Capital Bikeshare rental station near McPherson Square In May 2022, the city celebrated the expansion of its bike lane network to 104 miles (167 km), a 60 percent increase from 2015. Of those miles, 24 miles (39 km) were protected bike lanes . It also boasted 62 miles (100 km) of bike trails .

[ 325 ] As of March 2023 [update] , the city has 108 miles (174 km) of bike lanes, with 30 miles (48 km) of them protected bike lanes.

[ 326 ] D.C. is part of the regional Capital Bikeshare program. Started in 2010, it is one of the largest bicycle sharing systems in the country. As of February 2024 [update] , the program had 6,372 bicycles and 395 stations.

[ 327 ] A preceding SmartBike DC pilot program had begun in 2008.

[ 328 ] Walkability A 2021 study by Walk Score ranked Washington, D.C. the fifth-most walkable city in the country. According to the study, the most walkable neighborhoods are U Street , Dupont Circle , and Mount Vernon Square .

[ 329 ] In 2013, the Washington Metropolitan Area had the eighth lowest percentage of workers who commuted by private automobile (75.7 percent), with 8 percent of area workers traveling via rail transit.

[ 331 ] Rail See also: List of railroads in Washington, D.C.

Washington Metro , the second-busiest rapid rail system in the U.S. based on average weekday ridership, is known for its iconic vaulted ceilings Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) operates Washington Metro , the city's rapid transit rail system, which serves Washington, D.C. and its Maryland and Northern Virginia suburbs. Metro opened on March 27, 1976, and consists of six lines, 98 stations , and 129 miles (208 km) of track.

[ 332 ] Metro is the second-busiest rapid transit system in the country and fifth-busiest in North America .

[ 333 ] It operates mostly as a deep-level subway in more densely populated areas, while most of the suburban tracks are at surface level or elevated . Metro is known for its iconic brutalist -style vaulted ceilings in the interior stations.

[ citation needed ] The longest single-tier escalator in the Western Hemisphere, spanning 230 feet (70 m), is located at Metro's Wheaton station in Maryland.

[ 334 ] Washington Union Station , the city's main train station, serves approximately 70,000 passengers daily and is Amtrak 's second-busiest station with 4.6 million passengers annually and the southern terminus for the Northeast Corridor . Amtrak's Northeast Regional provides service northbound transportation to Baltimore Penn Station , New York Penn Station in Manhattan , 30th Street Station in Philadelphia , South Station in Boston , and other stops.

[ citation needed ] Maryland's MARC and Virginia's VRE commuter trains and the Metrorail Red Line also provide service into Union Station.

[ 335 ] As of 2023, Union Station is the ninth-busiest rail station in the nation and tenth-busiest in North America .

[ citation needed ] Washington, D.C.'s streetcars , which were a prominent form of 19th and early transportation, were dismantled in the 1960s. In 2016, however, the city brought back a streetcar line, DC Streetcar , which is a single line system in Northeast Washington, D.C., along H Street and Benning Road , known as the H Street/Benning Road Line .

[ 336 ] Bus Metrobus , operated by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority Two main public bus systems operate in Washington, D.C.

Metrobus , operated by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA), is the primary public bus system in Washington, D.C. Serving more than 400,000 riders each weekday, it is one of the nation's largest bus systems by annual ridership.

[ 337 ] The city also operates its own DC Circulator bus system, which connects commercial and touristic areas within central Washington.

[ 338 ] The DC Circulator costs only $1 to ride and is composed of six distinct routes that cover central D.C. and suburban Rosslyn, Virginia . The DC Circulator is run via a public-private partnership between the District of Columbia Department of Transportation , WMATA, and DC Surface Transit, Inc. (DCST). The bus system services each stop approximately every 10 minutes.

[ 339 ] There are also numerous commuter buses that residents of the wider Washington region take to commute into the city for work or other events, such as the Loudoun County Transit Commuter Bus and the Maryland Transit Administration Commuter Bus.

[ 340 ] The city also has several bus lines used by tourists and others visiting the city, including Big Bus Tours , Old Town Trolley Tours, and DC Trails. Many tourists also arrive via charter buses.

[ citation needed ] Following renovations in 2011, Union Station became Washington's primary intercity bus transit center.

; and List of heliports in Washington, D.C.

Reagan Washington National Airport in Arlington, Virginia is the closest airport to the city among the three major Washington metropolitan area airports.

Three major airports serve the district, though none are within the city's borders. Two of these major airports are located in suburban Northern Virginia and one in suburban Maryland . The closest is Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport , which is located in Arlington County, Virginia , just across the Potomac River about 5 miles (8 km) from downtown Washington, D.C. This airport provides primarily domestic flights and has the lowest number of passengers of the three airports in the region. The busiest by number of total passengers is Baltimore/Washington International Airport (BWI), located in Anne Arundel County , Maryland about 30 miles (48 km) northeast of the city.

[ 342 ] The busiest by international flights and the largest by land size and amount of facilities is Washington Dulles International Airport , located in Dulles, Virginia , about 24 miles (39 km) west of the city.

[ 343 ] Dulles has the most international passenger traffic of any airport in the Mid-Atlantic outside the New York metropolitan area , including approximately 90% of the international passenger traffic in the Washington-Baltimore region .

[ 344 ] Each of these three airports also serves as a hub for a major American airline: Reagan National Airport is a hub for American Airlines , [ 345 ] Dulles is a major hub for United Airlines and Star Alliance partners, [ 346 ] and BWI is an operating base for Southwest Airlines .

[ 347 ] In 2018, the Washington, D.C. area was the 18th-busiest airport system in the world by passenger traffic, accumulating over 74 million passengers between its three main commercial airports; by 2022 it had climbed to 13th-busiest for passenger traffic, even though passenger numbers decreased to less than 69 million.

[ citation needed ] The President of the United States does not use any of these airports for travel. Instead, the U.S. president typically travels by Marine One from the South Lawn of the White House to Joint Base Andrews in suburban Maryland. From there, he takes Air Force One to his destination.

[ 348 ] Utilities The Blue Plains Advanced Wastewater Treatment Plant in D.C. is the largest advanced wastewater treatment facility in the world.

[ 349 ] The District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority , also known as WASA or D.C. Water, is an independent authority of the Washington, D.C., government that provides drinking water and wastewater collection in the city. WASA purchases water from the historic Washington Aqueduct , which is operated by the Army Corps of Engineers . The water, sourced from the Potomac River , is treated and stored in the city's Dalecarlia , Georgetown , and McMillan reservoirs. The aqueduct provides drinking water for a total of 1.1 million people in the district and Virginia, including Arlington, Falls Church, and a portion of Fairfax County.

[ 350 ] Pepco is the city's electric utility and services 793,000 customers in the district and suburban Maryland.

[ 351 ] An 1889 law prohibits overhead wires within much of the historic City of Washington. As a result, all power lines and telecommunication cables are located underground in downtown Washington, and traffic signals are placed at the edge of the street.

[ 352 ] The D.C. Public Service Commission approved a seven-year, $500 million plan in 2017 to bury more lines underground; construction started in 2019.

[ 353 ] [ 354 ] Washington Gas is the city's natural gas utility and serves more than a million customers in the district and its suburbs.

[ 355 ] [ non-primary source needed ] Crime and police Main article: Crime in Washington, D.C.

See also: List of law enforcement agencies in the District of Columbia Washington, D.C., police on Harley-Davidson motorcycles escorting the March for Life protest on Constitution Avenue in January 2018 Washington has historically endured high crime, particularly violent offences. The city was once described as the "murder capital" of the United States during the early 1990s.

[ 356 ] The number of murders peaked in 1991 at 479, but then began to decline, [ 357 ] reaching a historic low of 88 in 2012, the lowest total since 1961.

[ 358 ] In 2016, the district's Metropolitan Police Department tallied 135 homicides, a 53% increase from 2012 but a 17% decrease from 2015.

[ 359 ] Violent crime per-capita has steadily declined since 2012, aside from a spike in 2023 (when D.C. recorded 274 homicides, a 20-year high); [ 360 ] in 2024, violent crimes per-capita reached their lowest levels since 2010, [ 361 ] [ 362 ] and as of August 2025 police statistics had so far recorded a 7% decrease in overall crime year-over-year, and a 26% decrease in violent crime.

[ 363 ] [ 364 ] [ 365 ] [ 366 ] According to a 2018 report, 67,000 residents, or about 10% of the population, are ex-convicts.

[ 367 ] An estimated 2,000–2,500 offenders return to the city from prison every year.

[ 368 ] Many D.C. residents began to press the city government for refusing to prosecute nearly 70% of arrested offenders in 2022. After months of criticism, the rate of unprosecuted cases dropped to 56% by October 2023—albeit still higher than nine of the past 10 years and almost twice what it was in 2013.

[ 369 ] In February 2024, the Council of the District of Columbia passed a major bill meant to reduce crime in the city by introducing harsher penalties for arrested offenders.

[ 370 ] Rising crime and gang activities contributed to some local businesses leaving the city.

[ 371 ] [ 372 ] In 2008, the Supreme Court of the United States held in District of Columbia v. Heller that the city's 1976 handgun ban violated the right to keep and bear arms as protected under the Second Amendment .

[ 373 ] However, a number of gun control measures remain in place, including those requiring firearm registration and banning assault weapons.

[ 374 ] In addition to the Metropolitan Police Department, several federal law enforcement agencies have jurisdiction in the city, including the U.S. Park Police , founded in 1791.

[ 375 ] Because the D.C. National Guard serves a federal district, the president of the United States—and not city officials—has power to deploy it. Under Section 740 of the Home Rule Act, the president also has the power to temporarily take over the police force in emergency situations for a maximum of 30 days; this period can be extended with congressional approval.

[ 376 ] [ 377 ] [ 378 ] In August 2025, Donald Trump invoked Section 740 to declare a public safety emergency.

Outline of Washington, D.C.

USS District of Columbia Explanatory notes ^ While both the city and federal district have operated as a single entity since 1871 , "Washington" historically referred specifically to the city, and "District of Columbia" referred specifically to the federal district.

^ By 1790, the Southern states had largely repaid their overseas debts from the Revolutionary War. The Northern states had not and wanted the federal government to take over their outstanding liabilities. Southern Congressmen agreed to the plan in return for establishing the new national capital at their preferred site on the Potomac River.

[ 22 ] : 124 ^ The Residence Act allowed the President to select a location within Maryland as far east as the Anacostia River . However, Washington shifted the federal territory's borders to the southeast and rotated them to include Alexandria at the district's southern tip. In 1791, Congress amended the Residence Act to approve the new site, including territory ceded by Virginia.

[ 22 ] : 89–92 ^ Mean monthly maxima and minima (i.e. the expected highest and lowest temperature readings at any point during the year or given month) calculated based on data at said location from 1991 to 2020.

^ Official records for Washington, D.C. were kept at 24th and M Streets NW from January 1872 to June 1945, and at Reagan National Airport since July 1945.

[ 100 ] ^ Apportionment totals are collected by combining Resident and Overseas population. (For D.C., this is 689545 residents and 1988 overseas population.) ^ Until 1890, the Census Bureau counted the City of Washington, Georgetown , and unincorporated portions of Washington County as three separate areas. The data provided in this article from before 1890 are calculated as if the District of Columbia were a single municipality as it is today. Population data for each city prior to 1890 are available.

[ 131 ] ^ a b Estimated using a 15% sub-sample ^ The territories of the United States have the highest poverty rates in the United States.

[ 159 ] ^ Defined as "members, children who are not members, and others who are not members but are considered participants in the congregation" [ 163 ] ^ Including one restaurant in Virginia, The Inn at Little Washington ^ Listed in the order each agreement was first established, D.C.'s sister cities are Bangkok , Thailand; Dakar , Senegal; Beijing , China; Brussels , Belgium; Athens , Greece; Paris , France; Pretoria , South Africa; Seoul , South Korea; Accra , Ghana; Sunderland , United Kingdom; Rome , Italy; Ankara , Turkey; Brasília , Brazil; Addis Ababa , Ethiopia; and San Salvador , El Salvador. Each of the listed cities is a national capital except for Sunderland, which includes the town of Washington , the ancestral home of George Washington's family.

[ 280 ] ^ The collection includes: 25 million catalogued books, 15.5 million other print items, 4.2 million recordings, 74.5 million manuscripts, 5.6 million maps, and 8.2 million sheet music pieces.
