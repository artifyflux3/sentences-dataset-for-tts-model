Military career [ edit ] Destouches was a lieutenant-general of the artillery in the Royal Army.

[ 1 ] He served under Kings Louis XIV and Louis XV , gaining the nickname Canon . He became a chevalier of the ordre de Saint-Lazare in 1690, and a chevalier of the ordre de Saint-Louis in 1720, then commandeur in 1725.

Family [ edit ] From an affair with his mistress Claudine Guérin de Tencin , Destouches fathered a child in 1717. In later life, this son would become famous as Jean le Rond d'Alembert , mathematician, philosophe , and co-editor of the Encyclopédie . At first, the child was abandoned to the Church by its mother, but Destouches arranged to have him raised privately by a family of the artisanal class.

[ 2 ] Destouches then secretly funded his illegitimate son's education, and when he died in Paris in 1726, he left d'Alembert a healthy income of 1,200 livres a year.
