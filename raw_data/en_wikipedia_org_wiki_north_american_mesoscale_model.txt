Find sources: "North American Mesoscale Model" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( January 2019 ) An example of a NAM-created model sounding The North American Mesoscale Model ( NAM ) is a numerical weather prediction model run by National Centers for Environmental Prediction for short-term weather forecasting . Currently, the Weather Research and Forecasting Non-hydrostatic Mesoscale Model (WRF-NMM) model system serves as the dynamical core of the NAM model. The WRF replaced the Eta model on June 13, 2006.

[ 1 ] The NAM is run four times a day (00, 06, 12, 18 UTC) out to 84 hours, with 12 km horizontal resolution and with three-hour temporal resolution, providing finer detail than other operational forecast models. Its ensemble is known as the Short Range Ensemble Forecast (SREF) and runs out 87 hours.
