Some geologic processes are destructive or transformative of structures or minerals, and when a process is not complete or does not completely destroy certain features, the left-over feature is a relict of what was there before. For example, relict permafrost is an area of ancient permafrost which remains despite a change in climate which would prohibit new permafrost from forming [ 1 ] or it could be a fragment of ancient soil or sediment found in a younger stratum . A relict sediment is an area of ancient sediment which remains unburied despite changes in the surrounding environment. In pedology , the study of soil formation and classification, ancient soil found in the geologic record is called a paleosol , material formed in the distant past on what was then the surface. A relict paleosol is still found on the surface, and yet is known to have been formed under conditions radically different from the present climate and topography.

[ 2 ] In mineralogy , a relict mineral is a surviving mineral from a parent rock that underwent a  destructive or transformative process.  For example, serpentinite is a kind of rock formed in a process called serpentinization , in which a host mineral produces a pseudomorph , and the original mineral is eventually replaced and/or destroyed, but is still present until the process is complete.

[ 3 ] Within geomorphology a relict landform is a landform that took form from geomorphic processes that are not active at present. In a Scandinavian context, this is often meant to imply that relict landforms were formed before the last glaciation and survived it under cold-based parts of the ice sheet .

[ 4 ] Climatic geomorphologist Julius Büdel estimated that 95% of mid-latitude landforms are relict.
