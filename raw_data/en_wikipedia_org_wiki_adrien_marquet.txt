Career [ edit ] Marquet was born in Bordeaux and became its socialist mayor in 1925. In 1933, he was expelled from the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO).

[ 1 ] The expulsion involved an address to the SFIO in which he emphasized order and authority as necessary to win the masses; his position frightened Léon Blum .

[ 2 ] He and Marcel Déat then formed the Neosocialists . Later, he declared the faction to be decidedly anti- Marxist .

[ 3 ] He eventually abandoned any form of socialism and briefly served as Minister of the Interior for Philippe Pétain .

[ 4 ] Later, like  Déat, he became a supporter of Pierre Laval .
