[ 1 ] Definitions by transport of structure are regarded as canonical.

Examples [ edit ] Since mathematical structures are often defined in reference to an underlying space , many examples of transport of structure involve spaces and mappings between them.  For example, if V {\displaystyle V} and W {\displaystyle W} are vector spaces with ( ⋅ ⋅ , ⋅ ⋅ ) {\displaystyle (\cdot ,\cdot )} being an inner product on W {\displaystyle W} , such that there is an isomorphism ϕ ϕ {\displaystyle \phi } from V {\displaystyle V} to W {\displaystyle W} , then one can define an inner product [ ⋅ ⋅ , ⋅ ⋅ ] {\displaystyle [\cdot ,\cdot ]} on V {\displaystyle V} by the following rule: [ v 1 , v 2 ] = ( ϕ ϕ ( v 1 ) , ϕ ϕ ( v 2 ) ) {\displaystyle [v_{1},v_{2}]=(\phi (v_{1}),\phi (v_{2}))} Although the equation makes sense even when ϕ ϕ {\displaystyle \phi } is not an isomorphism, it only defines an inner product on V {\displaystyle V} when ϕ ϕ {\displaystyle \phi } is, since otherwise it will cause [ ⋅ ⋅ , ⋅ ⋅ ] {\displaystyle [\cdot ,\cdot ]} to be degenerate .  The idea is that ϕ ϕ {\displaystyle \phi } allows one to consider V {\displaystyle V} and W {\displaystyle W} as "the same" vector space, and by following this analogy, then one can transport an inner product from one space to the other.

A more elaborated example comes from differential topology , in which the notion of smooth manifold is involved: if M {\displaystyle M} is such a manifold, and if X {\displaystyle X} is any topological space which is homeomorphic to M {\displaystyle M} , then one can consider X {\displaystyle X} as a smooth manifold as well. That is, given a homeomorphism ϕ ϕ : : X → → M {\displaystyle \phi \colon X\to M} , one can define coordinate charts on X {\displaystyle X} by "pulling back" coordinate charts on M {\displaystyle M} through ϕ ϕ {\displaystyle \phi } .  Recall that a coordinate chart on M {\displaystyle M} is an open set U {\displaystyle U} together with an injective map c : : U → → R n {\displaystyle c\colon U\to \mathbb {R} ^{n}} for some natural number n {\displaystyle n} ; to get such a chart on X {\displaystyle X} , one uses the following rules: U ′ = ϕ ϕ − − 1 ( U ) {\displaystyle U'=\phi ^{-1}(U)} and c ′ = c ∘ ∘ ϕ ϕ {\displaystyle c'=c\circ \phi } .

Furthermore, it is required that the charts cover M {\displaystyle M} (the fact that the transported charts cover X {\displaystyle X} follows immediately from the fact that ϕ ϕ {\displaystyle \phi } is a bijection ). Since M {\displaystyle M} is a smooth manifold, if U and V , with their maps c : : U → → R n {\displaystyle c\colon U\to \mathbb {R} ^{n}} and d : : V → → R n {\displaystyle d\colon V\to \mathbb {R} ^{n}} , are two charts on M {\displaystyle M} , then the composition, the "transition map" d ∘ ∘ c − − 1 : : c ( U ∩ ∩ V ) → → R n {\displaystyle d\circ c^{-1}\colon c(U\cap V)\to \mathbb {R} ^{n}} (a self-map of R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} ) is smooth. To verify this for the transported charts on X {\displaystyle X} , notice that ϕ ϕ − − 1 ( U ) ∩ ∩ ϕ ϕ − − 1 ( V ) = ϕ ϕ − − 1 ( U ∩ ∩ V ) {\displaystyle \phi ^{-1}(U)\cap \phi ^{-1}(V)=\phi ^{-1}(U\cap V)} , and therefore c ′ ( U ′ ∩ ∩ V ′ ) = ( c ∘ ∘ ϕ ϕ ) ( ϕ ϕ − − 1 ( U ∩ ∩ V ) ) = c ( U ∩ ∩ V ) {\displaystyle c'(U'\cap V')=(c\circ \phi )(\phi ^{-1}(U\cap V))=c(U\cap V)} , and d ′ ∘ ∘ ( c ′ ) − − 1 = ( d ∘ ∘ ϕ ϕ ) ∘ ∘ ( c ∘ ∘ ϕ ϕ ) − − 1 = d ∘ ∘ ( ϕ ϕ ∘ ∘ ϕ ϕ − − 1 ) ∘ ∘ c − − 1 = d ∘ ∘ c − − 1 {\displaystyle d'\circ (c')^{-1}=(d\circ \phi )\circ (c\circ \phi )^{-1}=d\circ (\phi \circ \phi ^{-1})\circ c^{-1}=d\circ c^{-1}} .

Thus the transition map for U ′ {\displaystyle U'} and V ′ {\displaystyle V'} is the same as that for U {\displaystyle U} and V {\displaystyle V} , hence smooth.  That is, X {\displaystyle X} is a smooth manifold via transport of structure. This is a special case of transport of structures in general.

[ 2 ] The second example also illustrates why "transport of structure" is not always desirable. Namely, one can take M {\displaystyle M} to be the plane, and X {\displaystyle X} to be an infinite one-sided cone.  By "flattening" the cone, a homeomorphism of X {\displaystyle X} and M {\displaystyle M} can be obtained, and therefore the structure of a smooth manifold on X {\displaystyle X} , but the cone is not "naturally" a smooth manifold. That is, one can consider X {\displaystyle X} as a subspace of 3-space, in which context it is not smooth at the cone point.

A more surprising example is that of exotic spheres , discovered by John Milnor , which states that there are exactly 28 smooth manifolds which are homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic to S 7 {\displaystyle S^{7}} , the 7-dimensional sphere in 8-space. Thus, transport of structure is most productive when there exists a canonical isomorphism between the two objects.
