Intermediate minor rankings are not shown.

In biology a section ( Latin : sectio ) is a taxonomic rank that is applied differently in botany and zoology .

In botany [ edit ] Main article: Section (botany) Within flora (plants), 'section' refers to a botanical rank below the genus, but above the species: Domain > Kingdom > Division > Class > Order > Family > Tribe > Genus > Subgenus > Section > Subsection > Species In zoology [ edit ] Within fauna (animals), 'section' refers to an uncommonly used zoological rank below the order, but above the family: Domain > Kingdom > Phylum > Class > Order > Section > Family > Tribe > Genus > Species The rank of Superfamily is commonly adopted instead.

In bacteriology [ edit ] The International Code of Nomenclature for Bacteria states that the Section rank is an informal one, between the subgenus and species (as in botany).
