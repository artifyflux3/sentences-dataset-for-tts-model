**Japanese** (日本語, _Nihongo_; [[ɲihoŋɡo]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Japanese "Help:IPA/Japanese")[](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/transcoded/9/99/Ja-nihongo.ogg/Ja-nihongo.ogg.mp3 "Play audio")[ⓘ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ja-nihongo.ogg "File:Ja-nihongo.ogg")) is the principal language of the [Japonic language family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japonic_languages "Japonic languages") spoken by the [Japanese people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_people "Japanese people"). It has around 123 million speakers, primarily in [Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan "Japan"), the only country where it is the [national language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_language "National language"), and within the [Japanese diaspora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_diaspora "Japanese diaspora") worldwide.

The Japonic family also includes the [Ryukyuan languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryukyuan_languages "Ryukyuan languages") and the variously classified [Hachijō language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hachij%C5%8D_language "Hachijō language"). There have been many [attempts to group the Japonic languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classification_of_the_Japonic_languages "Classification of the Japonic languages") with other families such as [Ainu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ainu_languages "Ainu languages"), [Austronesian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austronesian_languages "Austronesian languages"), [Koreanic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koreanic_languages "Koreanic languages"), and the now discredited [Altaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altaic_languages "Altaic languages"), but none of these proposals have gained any widespread acceptance.

Little is known of the language's prehistory, or when it first appeared in Japan. Chinese documents from the 3rd century AD recorded a few Japanese words, but substantial [Old Japanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Japanese "Old Japanese") texts did not appear until the 8th century. From the [Heian period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heian_period "Heian period") (794–1185), extensive waves of [Sino-Japanese vocabulary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Japanese_vocabulary "Sino-Japanese vocabulary") entered the language, affecting the [phonology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonology "Phonology") of [Early Middle Japanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Middle_Japanese "Early Middle Japanese"). [Late Middle Japanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Middle_Japanese "Late Middle Japanese") (1185–1600) saw extensive grammatical changes and the first appearance of [European loanwords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gairaigo "Gairaigo"). The basis of the [standard dialect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Japanese "Standard Japanese") moved from the [Kansai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansai "Kansai") region to the [Edo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edo_(Tokyo) "Edo (Tokyo)") region (modern [Tokyo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo "Tokyo")) in the [Early Modern Japanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Modern_Japanese "Early Modern Japanese") period (early 17th century–mid 19th century). Following the end of [Japan's self-imposed isolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sakoku "Sakoku") in 1853, the flow of [loanwords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loanword "Loanword") from European languages increased significantly, and [words from English roots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasei-eigo "Wasei-eigo") have proliferated.

Japanese is an [agglutinative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agglutinative_language "Agglutinative language"), [mora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mora_(linguistics)#Japanese "Mora (linguistics)")-timed language with relatively simple [phonotactics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonotactics "Phonotactics"), a [pure vowel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monophthong "Monophthong") system, [phonemic vowel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel_length#Phonemic_vowel_length "Vowel length") and [consonant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemination "Gemination") length, and a lexically significant [pitch-accent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_pitch_accent "Japanese pitch accent"). Word order is normally [subject–object–verb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject%E2%80%93object%E2%80%93verb "Subject–object–verb") with [particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_particles "Japanese particles") marking the [grammatical function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_function "Grammatical function") of words, and sentence structure is [topic–comment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic%E2%80%93comment "Topic–comment"). [Sentence-final particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence-final_particle "Sentence-final particle") are used to add emotional or emphatic impact, or form questions. Nouns have no [grammatical number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_number "Grammatical number") or [gender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_gender "Grammatical gender"), and there are no [articles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_(grammar) "Article (grammar)"). Verbs are [conjugated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_verb_conjugation "Japanese verb conjugation"), primarily for [tense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_tense "Grammatical tense") and [voice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_(grammar) "Voice (grammar)"), but not [person](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_person "Grammatical person"). [Japanese adjectives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_adjectives "Japanese adjectives") are also conjugated. Japanese has [a complex system of honorifics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honorific_speech_in_Japanese "Honorific speech in Japanese"), with verb forms and vocabulary to indicate the relative status of the speaker, the listener, and persons mentioned.

The [Japanese writing system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_writing_system "Japanese writing system") combines [Chinese characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_characters "Chinese characters"), known as _[kanji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanji "Kanji")_ (漢字, '[Han](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_dynasty "Han dynasty") characters'), with two unique [syllabaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllabary "Syllabary") (or [moraic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mora_(linguistics) "Mora (linguistics)") scripts) derived by the Japanese from the more complex Chinese characters: _[hiragana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiragana "Hiragana")_ (ひらがな or 平仮名, 'simple characters') and _[katakana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katakana "Katakana")_ (カタカナ or 片仮名, 'partial characters'). [Latin script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Japanese "Romanization of Japanese") (_rōmaji_ ローマ字) is also used in a limited fashion (such as for imported acronyms) in Japanese writing. The [numeral system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_numerals "Japanese numerals") uses mostly [Arabic numerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_numerals "Arabic numerals"), but also traditional [Chinese numerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_numerals "Chinese numerals").

History
-------

### Prehistory

[Proto-Japonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Japonic_language "Proto-Japonic language"), the common ancestor of the Japanese and [Ryukyuan languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryukyuan_languages "Ryukyuan languages"), is thought to have been brought to Japan by settlers coming from the Korean peninsula sometime in the early- to mid-4th century BC (the [Yayoi period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yayoi_period "Yayoi period")), replacing the languages of the original [Jōmon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C5%8Dmon_people "Jōmon people") inhabitants,[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#cite_note-2) including the ancestor of the modern [Ainu language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ainu_language "Ainu language"). Because writing had yet to be introduced from China, there is no direct evidence, and anything that can be discerned about this period must be based on internal reconstruction from [Old Japanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Japanese "Old Japanese"), or [comparison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_method "Comparative method") with the Ryukyuan languages and [Japanese dialects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_dialects "Japanese dialects").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFrellesvigWhitman2008[httpsbooksgooglecombooksidaun8BRHTDEACpgPA1_1]-3)

### Old Japanese

[![Image 2: Page from the Man'yōshū](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/Genryaku_Manyosyu.JPG/250px-Genryaku_Manyosyu.JPG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Genryaku_Manyosyu.JPG)

A page from the _[Man'yōshū](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man%27y%C5%8Dsh%C5%AB "Man'yōshū")_, the oldest anthology of classical [Japanese poetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_poetry "Japanese poetry")

The [Chinese writing system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_character "Chinese character") was imported to Japan from [Baekje](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baekje "Baekje") around the start of the fifth century, alongside Buddhism.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFrellesvig201011-4) The earliest texts were written in [Classical Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Chinese "Classical Chinese"), although some of these were likely intended to be read as Japanese using the _[kanbun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanbun "Kanbun")_ method, and show influences of Japanese grammar such as Japanese word order.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#cite_note-FOOTNOTESeeley199125%E2%80%9331-5) The earliest text, the _[Kojiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kojiki "Kojiki")_, dates to the early eighth century, and was written entirely in Chinese characters, which are used to represent, at different times, Chinese, _kanbun_, and Old Japanese.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFrellesvig201024-6) As in other texts from this period, the Old Japanese sections are written in [Man'yōgana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man%27y%C5%8Dgana "Man'yōgana"), which uses _[kanji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanji "Kanji")_ for their phonetic as well as semantic values.

Based on the Man'yōgana system, Old Japanese can be reconstructed as having 88 distinct [morae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mora_(linguistics)#Japanese "Mora (linguistics)"). Texts written with Man'yōgana use two different sets of _kanji_ for each of the morae now pronounced き (_ki_), ひ (_hi_), み (_mi_), け (_ke_), へ (_he_), め (_me_), こ (_ko_), そ (_so_), と (_to_), の (_no_), も (_mo_), よ(_yo_) and ろ (_ro_).[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#cite_note-7) (The _Kojiki_ has 88, but all later texts have 87. The distinction between mo 1 and mo 2 apparently was lost immediately following its composition.) This set of morae shrank to 67 in [Early Middle Japanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Middle_Japanese "Early Middle Japanese"), though some were added through Chinese influence. Man'yōgana also has a symbol for /je/, which merges with /e/ before the end of the period.

Several fossilizations of Old Japanese grammatical elements remain in the modern language – the genitive particle _tsu_ (superseded by modern _no_) is preserved in words such as _matsuge_ ("eyelash", lit. "hair of the eye"); modern _mieru_ ("to be visible") and _kikoeru_ ("to be audible") retain a [mediopassive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediopassive_voice "Mediopassive voice") suffix -_yu(ru)_ (_kikoyu_ → _kikoyuru_ (the attributive form, which slowly replaced the plain form starting in the late Heian period) → _kikoeru_ (all verbs with the _shimo-nidan_ conjugation pattern underwent this same shift in [Early Modern Japanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Modern_Japanese "Early Modern Japanese"))); and the genitive particle _ga_ remains in intentionally archaic speech.

### Early Middle Japanese

[![Image 3: Genji Monogatari emaki scroll](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/Genji_emaki_01003_001.jpg/250px-Genji_emaki_01003_001.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Genji_emaki_01003_001.jpg)

A 12th-century [emaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emaki "Emaki") scroll of _[The Tale of Genji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Tale\_of\_Genji "The Tale of Genji")_ from the 11th century

Early Middle Japanese is the Japanese of the [Heian period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heian_period "Heian period"), from 794 to 1185. It formed the basis for the [literary standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_language "Literary language") of [Classical Japanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Japanese "Classical Japanese"), which remained in common use until the early 20th century.

During this time, Japanese underwent numerous [phonological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonology "Phonology") developments, in many cases instigated by an influx of [Chinese loanwords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Japanese_vocabulary "Sino-Japanese vocabulary"). These included phonemic length distinction for both [consonants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemination "Gemination") and [vowels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel_length "Vowel length"), palatal consonants (e.g. _kya_) and labial consonant clusters (e.g. _kwa_), and [closed syllables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable#Open_and_closed "Syllable").[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#cite_note-Frel-8)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#cite_note-9) This had the effect of changing Japanese into a [mora-timed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isochrony#Mora_timing "Isochrony") language.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#cite_note-Frel-8)

### Late Middle Japanese

Late Middle Japanese covers the years from 1185 to 1600, and is normally divided into two sections, roughly equivalent to the [Kamakura period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamakura_period "Kamakura period") and the [Muromachi period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muromachi_period "Muromachi period"), respectively. The later forms of Late Middle Japanese are the first to be described by non-native sources, in this case the [Jesuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesuits "Jesuits") and [Franciscan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franciscans "Franciscans") missionaries; and thus there is better documentation of Late Middle Japanese phonology than for previous forms (for instance, the _[Arte da Lingoa de Iapam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arte\_da\_Lingoa\_de\_Iapam "Arte da Lingoa de Iapam")_). Among other sound changes, the sequence /au/ merges to /ɔː/, in contrast with /oː/; /p/ is reintroduced from Chinese; and /we/ merges with /je/. Some forms rather more familiar to Modern Japanese speakers begin to appear – the continuative ending -_te_ begins to reduce onto the verb (e.g. _yonde_ for earlier _yomite_), the -k- in the final mora of adjectives drops out (_shiroi_ for earlier _shiroki_); and some forms exist where modern standard Japanese has retained the earlier form (e.g. _hayaku_>_hayau_>_hayɔɔ_, where modern Japanese just has _hayaku_, though the alternative form is preserved in the standard greeting _o-hayō gozaimasu_ "good morning"; this ending is also seen in _o-medetō_ "congratulations", from _medetaku_).

Late Middle Japanese has the first loanwords from European languages – now-common words borrowed into Japanese in this period include _pan_ ("bread") and _tabako_ ("tobacco", now "cigarette"), both from [Portuguese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_language "Portuguese language").

### Modern Japanese

"Standard Japanese" redirects here. For other dialects, see [Japanese dialects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_dialects "Japanese dialects").

Modern Japanese is considered to begin with the [Edo period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edo_period "Edo period") (which spanned from 1603 to 1867). Since Old Japanese, the _de facto_ standard Japanese had been the [Kansai dialect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansai_dialect "Kansai dialect"), especially that of [Kyoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto "Kyoto"). However, during the Edo period, Edo (now Tokyo) developed into the largest city in Japan, and the Edo-area dialect became standard Japanese. Since the end of [Japan's self-imposed isolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sakoku "Sakoku") in 1853, the flow of loanwords from European languages has increased significantly. The period since 1945 has seen many words borrowed from other languages—such as German (e.g. _arubaito_ 'temporary job', _wakuchin_ 'vaccine'), Portuguese (_kasutera_ 'sponge cake') and English.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#cite_note-10) Many English loan words especially relate to technology—for example, _pasokon_ 'personal computer', _intānetto_ 'internet', and _kamera_ 'camera'. Due to the large quantity of English loanwords, modern Japanese has developed a distinction between [tɕi] and [ti], and [dʑi] and [di], with the latter in each pair only found in loanwords, eg. _paati_ for party or _dizunii_ for Disney.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#cite_note-11)

Geographic distribution
-----------------------

Although Japanese is spoken almost exclusively in Japan, it has also been spoken outside of the country. Before and during [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II"), through Japanese annexation of [Taiwan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan "Taiwan") and [Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea "Korea"), as well as partial occupation of [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China "China"), the [Philippines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines "Philippines"), and various Pacific islands,[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#cite_note-12) locals in [those countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_East_Asia_Co-Prosperity_Sphere "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere") learned Japanese as the language of the empire. As a result, many elderly people in these countries can still speak Japanese.

[Japanese emigrant communities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_diaspora "Japanese diaspora") (the largest of which are to be found in [Brazil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil "Brazil"),[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#cite_note-IBGE_tra%C3%A7a_perfil_dos_imigrantes-13) with 1.4 million to 1.5 million Japanese immigrants and descendants, according to Brazilian [IBGE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_Institute_of_Geography_and_Statistics "Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics") data, more than the 1.2 million of the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States"))[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#cite_note-14) sometimes employ Japanese as their primary language. Approximately 12% of [Hawaii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii "Hawaii") residents speak Japanese,[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#cite_note-15) with an estimated 12.6% of the population of Japanese ancestry in 2008. Japanese emigrants can also be found in [Peru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peru "Peru"), [Argentina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina "Argentina"), [Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia "Australia") (especially in the eastern states), [Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada "Canada") (especially in [Vancouver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver "Vancouver"), where 1.4% of the population has Japanese ancestry),[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#cite_note-16) the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States") (notably in [Hawaii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii "Hawaii"), where 16.7% of the population has Japanese ancestry,[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#cite_note-17)[_[clarification needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please\_clarify "Wikipedia:Please clarify")_] and [California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California "California")), and the [Philippines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines "Philippines") (particularly in [Davao Region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davao_Region "Davao Region") and the [Province of Laguna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laguna_(province) "Laguna (province)")).[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#cite_note-18)[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#cite_note-19)[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#cite_note-20)

### Official status

Japanese has no [official status](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_language "Official language") in Japan,[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#cite_note-21) but is the _de facto_[national language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_language "National language") of the country. There is a form of the language considered [standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_language "Standard language"): _hyōjungo_ (標準語), meaning 'standard Japanese', or _kyōtsūgo_ (共通語), 'common language', or even 'Tokyo dialect' at times.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#cite_note-:2-22) The meanings of the two terms (hyōjungo and kyōtsūgo) are almost the same. _Hyōjungo_ or _kyōtsūgo_ is a conception that forms the counterpart of dialect. This normative language was born after the [Meiji Restoration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiji_Restoration "Meiji Restoration") (明治維新, _meiji ishin_; 1868) from the language spoken in the higher-class areas of Tokyo (see [Yamanote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamanote_and_Shitamachi "Yamanote and Shitamachi")). _Hyōjungo_ is taught in schools and used on television and in official communications.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#cite_note-23) It is the version of Japanese discussed in this article.

_[Bungo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical\_Japanese "Classical Japanese")_ (文語; '[literary language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_language "Literary language")') used in formal texts, is different compared to the [colloquial language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colloquialism "Colloquialism") (口語, _[kōgo](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=K%C5%8Dgo\_(Japanese\_language)&action=edit&redlink=1 "Kōgo (Japanese language) (page does not exist)")_), used in everyday speech.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#cite_note-24) The two systems have different rules of grammar and some variance in vocabulary. _Bungo_ was the main method of writing Japanese until about 1900; since then _kōgo_ gradually extended its influence and the two methods were both used in writing until the 1940s. _Bungo_ still has some relevance for historians, literary scholars, and lawyers (many Japanese laws that survived [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II") are still written in _bungo_, although there are ongoing efforts to modernize their language). _Kōgo_ is the dominant method of both speaking and writing Japanese today, although _bungo_ grammar and vocabulary are occasionally used in modern Japanese for effect.

Japanese is, along with [Palauan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palauan_language "Palauan language") and English, an official language of [Angaur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angaur "Angaur"), Palau according to the 1982 state constitution.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#cite_note-const-25) At the time it was written, many of the elders participating in the process had been educated in Japanese during the [South Seas Mandate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Seas_Mandate "South Seas Mandate") over the island,[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#cite_note-26) as shown by the 1958 census of the Trust Territory of the Pacific which found that 89% of Palauans born between 1914 and 1933 could speak and read Japanese.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#cite_note-1958_Census_of_the_Trust_Territory_of_the_Pacific_Islands-27) However, as of the 2005 Palau census, no residents of Angaur were reported to speak Japanese at home.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#cite_note-2005census-28)

### Dialects and mutual intelligibility

[![Image 4](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/Japanese_dialects-en.png/250px-Japanese_dialects-en.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Japanese_dialects-en.png)

Map of Japanese dialects and Japonic languages

Japanese dialects typically differ in terms of [pitch accent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_pitch_accent "Japanese pitch accent"), inflectional [morphology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(linguistics) "Morphology (linguistics)"), [vocabulary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocabulary "Vocabulary"), and particle usage. Some even differ in [vowel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel "Vowel") and [consonant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consonant "Consonant") inventories, although this is less common.

In terms of [mutual intelligibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_intelligibility "Mutual intelligibility"), a survey in 1967 found that the four most unintelligible dialects (excluding [Ryūkyūan languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryukyuan_languages "Ryukyuan languages") and [Tōhoku dialects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C5%8Dhoku_dialect "Tōhoku dialect")) to students from Greater Tokyo were the [Kiso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiso,_Nagano_(town) "Kiso, Nagano (town)") dialect (in the deep mountains of [Nagano Prefecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagano_Prefecture "Nagano Prefecture")), the [Himi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himi,_Toyama "Himi, Toyama") dialect (in [Toyama Prefecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyama_Prefecture "Toyama Prefecture")), the [Kagoshima dialect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kagoshima_dialect "Kagoshima dialect") and the [Maniwa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maniwa "Maniwa") dialect (in [Okayama Prefecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okayama_Prefecture "Okayama Prefecture")).[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#cite_note-Dialect_Intelligibility_1967-29) The survey was based on 12- to 20-second-long recordings of 135 to 244 [phonemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoneme "Phoneme"), which 42 students listened to and translated word-for-word. The listeners were all [Keio University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keio_University "Keio University") students who grew up in the [Kantō region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kant%C5%8D_region "Kantō region").[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#cite_note-Dialect_Intelligibility_1967-29)

Intelligibility to students from Tokyo and [Kantō region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kant%C5%8D_region "Kantō region") (1967)[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#cite_note-Dialect_Intelligibility_1967-29)| Dialect | [Kyoto City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto "Kyoto") | [Ōgata, Kōchi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%8Cgata,_K%C5%8Dchi "Ōgata, Kōchi") | [Tatsuta, Aichi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatsuta,_Aichi "Tatsuta, Aichi") | [Kumamoto City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumamoto "Kumamoto") | [Osaka City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osaka "Osaka") | [Kanagi, Shimane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanagi,_Shimane "Kanagi, Shimane") | [Maniwa, Okayama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maniwa "Maniwa") | [Kagoshima City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kagoshima "Kagoshima") | [Kiso, Nagano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiso,_Nagano_(town) "Kiso, Nagano (town)") | [Himi, Toyama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himi,_Toyama "Himi, Toyama") |

| Percentage | 67.1% | 45.5% | 44.5% | 38.6% | 26.4% | 24.8% | 24.7% | 17.6% | 13.3% | 4.1% |

There are some [language islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_island "Language island") in mountain villages or isolated islands[_[clarification needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please\_clarify "Wikipedia:Please clarify")_] such as [Hachijō-jima island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hachij%C5%8D-jima "Hachijō-jima"), whose dialects are descended from [Eastern Old Japanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Old_Japanese "Eastern Old Japanese"). Dialects of the [Kansai region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansai_region "Kansai region") are spoken or known by many Japanese, and [Osaka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osaka "Osaka") dialect in particular is associated with comedy (see [Kansai dialect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansai_dialect "Kansai dialect")). Dialects of Tōhoku and North [Kantō](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kant%C5%8D_region "Kantō region") are associated with typical farmers.

The Ryūkyūan languages, spoken in [Okinawa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okinawa_Prefecture "Okinawa Prefecture") and the [Amami Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amami_Islands "Amami Islands") (administratively part of [Kagoshima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kagoshima_Prefecture "Kagoshima Prefecture")), are distinct enough to be considered a separate branch of the [Japonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japonic_languages "Japonic languages") family; not only is each language unintelligible to Japanese speakers, but most are unintelligible to those who speak other Ryūkyūan languages. However, in contrast to linguists, many ordinary Japanese people tend to consider the Ryūkyūan languages as dialects of Japanese.

The imperial court also seems to have spoken an unusual variant of the Japanese of the time,[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#cite_note-30) most likely the spoken form of [Classical Japanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Japanese "Classical Japanese"), a writing style that was prevalent during the [Heian period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heian_period "Heian period"), but began to decline during the late [Meiji period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiji_era "Meiji era").[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#cite_note-31) The Ryūkyūan languages are classified by [UNESCO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO "UNESCO") as 'endangered', as young people mostly use Japanese and cannot understand the languages. [Okinawan Japanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okinawan_Japanese "Okinawan Japanese") is a variant of Standard Japanese influenced by the Ryūkyūan languages, and is the primary dialect spoken among young people in the [Ryukyu Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryukyu_Islands "Ryukyu Islands").[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#cite_note-ryukyuan-tongue-32)

Modern Japanese has become prevalent nationwide (including the Ryūkyū islands) due to [education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education "Education"), [mass media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media "Mass media"), and an increase in mobility within Japan, as well as economic integration.

Classification
--------------

Japanese is a member of the [Japonic language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japonic_language "Japonic language") family, which also includes the [Ryukyuan languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryukyuan_languages "Ryukyuan languages") spoken in the [Ryukyu Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryukyu_Islands "Ryukyu Islands"). As these closely related languages are commonly treated as dialects of the same language, Japanese is sometimes called a [language isolate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_isolate "Language isolate").[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#cite_note-33)

According to [Martine Robbeets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martine_Robbeets "Martine Robbeets"), Japanese has been subject to more attempts to show its relation to other languages than any other language in the world. Since Japanese first gained the consideration of linguists in the late 19th century, attempts have been made to show its genealogical relation to languages or language families such as [Ainu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ainu_languages "Ainu languages"), [Korean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_language "Korean language"), [Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language "Chinese language"), [Tibeto-Burman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibeto-Burman_languages "Tibeto-Burman languages"), [Uralic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uralic_languages "Uralic languages"), [Altaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altaic_languages "Altaic languages") (or [Ural-Altaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ural-Altaic_languages "Ural-Altaic languages")), [Austroasiatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austroasiatic_languages "Austroasiatic languages"), [Austronesian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austronesian_languages "Austronesian languages") and [Dravidian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dravidian_languages "Dravidian languages").[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#cite_note-FOOTNOTERobbeets200520-34) At the fringe, some linguists have even suggested a link to [Indo-European languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_languages "Indo-European languages"), including [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language "Greek language"), or to [Sumerian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumerian_language "Sumerian language").[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShibatani199094-35) Main modern theories try to link Japanese either to northern Asian languages, like Korean or the proposed larger Altaic family, or to various [Southeast Asian languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classification_of_Southeast_Asian_languages "Classification of Southeast Asian languages"), especially [Austronesian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austronesian_languages "Austronesian languages"). None of these proposals have gained wide acceptance (and the Altaic family itself is now considered controversial).[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#cite_note-FOOTNOTERobbeets2005-36)[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#cite_note-37)[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#cite_note-FOOTNOTEVovin2010-38) As it stands, only the link to Ryukyuan has wide support.[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKindaichiHirano197830%E2%80%9331-39)

Other theories view the Japanese language as an early [creole language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creole_language "Creole language") formed through inputs from at least two distinct language groups, or as a distinct language of its own that has absorbed various aspects from neighboring languages.[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShibatani1990-40)[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#cite_note-41)[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#cite_note-42)

Japanese has five vowels, and [vowel length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel_length "Vowel length") is phonemic, with each having both a short and a long version. Elongated vowels are usually denoted with a line over the vowel (a [macron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macron_(diacritic) "Macron (diacritic)")) in [rōmaji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Japanese "Romanization of Japanese"), a repeated vowel character in [hiragana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiragana "Hiragana"), or a [chōonpu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C5%8Donpu "Chōonpu") succeeding the vowel in [katakana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katakana "Katakana"). /u/([listen](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/transcoded/4/4c/Ja-U.oga/Ja-U.oga.mp3 "Play audio")[ⓘ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ja-U.oga "File:Ja-U.oga")) is [compressed rather than protruded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roundedness "Roundedness"), or simply unrounded.

| Special moras | [/N/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#Moraic_nasal), [/Q/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#Gemination) |

Some Japanese consonants have several [allophones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allophone "Allophone"), which may give the impression of a larger inventory of sounds. However, some of these allophones have since become phonemic. For example, in the Japanese language up to and including the first half of the 20th century, the phonemic sequence /ti/ was [palatalized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palatalization_(sound_change) "Palatalization (sound change)") and realized phonetically as [tɕi], approximately _chi_([listen](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/transcoded/5/5a/Ja-Chi_2.oga/Ja-Chi_2.oga.mp3 "Play audio")[ⓘ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ja-Chi_2.oga "File:Ja-Chi 2.oga")); however, now [ti] and [tɕi] are distinct, as evidenced by words like _tī_[tiː] "Western-style tea" and _chii_[tɕii] "social status".

The "r" of the Japanese language is of particular interest, ranging between an [apical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apical_consonant "Apical consonant")[central](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_consonant "Central consonant")[tap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tap_and_flap_consonants "Tap and flap consonants") and a [lateral approximant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateral_consonant#Approximants "Lateral consonant"). The "g" is also notable; unless it starts a sentence, it may be pronounced [[ŋ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiced_velar_nasal "Voiced velar nasal")], in the Kanto prestige dialect and in other eastern dialects.

The [phonotactics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonotactics "Phonotactics") of Japanese are relatively simple. The syllable structure is (C)(G)V(C),[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#cite_note-43) that is, a core vowel surrounded by an optional onset consonant, a glide /j/ and either the first part of a [geminate consonant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemination "Gemination") (っ/ッ, represented as Q) or a [moraic nasal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_phonology#Moraic_nasal "Japanese phonology") in the coda (ん/ン, represented as N).

The nasal is sensitive to its phonetic environment and [assimilates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assimilation_(phonology) "Assimilation (phonology)") to the following phoneme, with pronunciations including [ɴ,m,n,ɲ,ŋ,ɰ̃]. Onset-glide clusters only occur at the start of syllables but clusters across syllables are allowed as long as the two consonants are the moraic nasal followed by a [homorganic consonant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homorganic_consonant "Homorganic consonant").

Japanese also includes a [pitch accent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_pitch_accent "Japanese pitch accent"), which is not represented in moraic writing; for example [haꜜ.ɕi] ("chopsticks") and [ha.ɕiꜜ] ("bridge") are both spelled はし (_hashi_), and are only differentiated by the tone contour.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#cite_note-:2-22) However, Japanese is not a [tonal language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonal_language "Tonal language").

Writing system
--------------

### History

Literacy was introduced to Japan in the form of the [Chinese writing system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Written_Chinese "Written Chinese"), by way of [Baekje](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baekje "Baekje") before the 5th century AD.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#cite_note-44)[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#cite_note-45)[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#cite_note-46)[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#cite_note-47) Using this script, the Japanese king [Bu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_kings_of_Wa "Five kings of Wa") presented a petition to [Emperor Shun of Song](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Shun_of_Song "Emperor Shun of Song") in AD 478.[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#cite_note-48) After the ruin of Baekje, Japan invited scholars from China to learn more of the Chinese writing system. Japanese emperors gave an official rank to Chinese scholars (続守言/薩弘恪/[[b]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#cite_note-49)[[c]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#cite_note-50)袁晋卿[[d]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#cite_note-51)) and spread the use of Chinese characters during the 7th and 8th centuries.

[![Image 6](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Nihongo_ichiran_01-converted.svg/250px-Nihongo_ichiran_01-converted.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Nihongo_ichiran_01-converted.svg)

Table of Kana (including [Yōon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y%C5%8Don "Yōon")): [Hiragana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiragana "Hiragana") top, [Katakana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katakana "Katakana") in the center and Romanized equivalents at the bottom

At first, the Japanese wrote in [Classical Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Chinese "Classical Chinese"), with Japanese names represented by characters used for their meanings and not their sounds. Later, during the 7th century AD, the Chinese-sounding phoneme principle was used to write pure Japanese poetry and prose, but some Japanese words were still written with characters for their meaning and not the original Chinese sound. This was the beginning of Japanese as a written language in its own right. By this time, the Japanese language was already very distinct from the [Ryukyuan languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryukyuan_languages "Ryukyuan languages").[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#cite_note-52)

An example of this mixed style is the _[Kojiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kojiki "Kojiki")_, which was written in AD 712. Japanese writers then started to use Chinese characters to write Japanese in a style known as _man'yōgana_, a syllabic script which used Chinese characters for their sounds in order to transcribe the words of Japanese speech mora by mora.

Over time, a writing system evolved. [Chinese characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_characters "Chinese characters") ([kanji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanji "Kanji")) were used to write either words borrowed from Chinese, or Japanese words with the same or similar meanings. Chinese characters were also used to write grammatical elements; these were simplified, and eventually became two moraic scripts: [hiragana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiragana "Hiragana") and [katakana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katakana "Katakana") which were developed based on [Man'yōgana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man%27y%C5%8Dgana "Man'yōgana"). Some scholars claim that Manyogana originated from Baekje, but this hypothesis is denied by mainstream Japanese scholars.[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#cite_note-53)[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#cite_note-54)

Hiragana and katakana were first simplified from kanji, and hiragana, emerging somewhere around the 9th century,[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#cite_note-55) was mainly used by women. Hiragana was seen as an informal language, whereas katakana and kanji were considered more formal and were typically used by men and in official settings. However, because of hiragana's accessibility, more and more people began using it. Eventually, by the 10th century, hiragana was used by everyone.[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#cite_note-56)

Modern Japanese is written in a mixture of three main systems: kanji, characters of Chinese origin used to represent both Chinese [loanwords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loanword "Loanword") into Japanese and a number of native Japanese [morphemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morpheme "Morpheme"); and two [syllabaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllabary "Syllabary"): hiragana and katakana. The [Latin script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_script "Latin script") (or _rōmaji_ in Japanese) is used to a certain extent, such as for imported acronyms and to transcribe Japanese names and in other instances where non-Japanese speakers need to know how to pronounce a word (such as "ramen" at a restaurant). Arabic numerals are much more common than the kanji numerals when used in counting, but kanji numerals are still used in compounds, such as 統一 (_tōitsu_, "unification").

Historically, attempts to limit the number of kanji in use commenced in the mid-19th century, but government did not intervene until after Japan's defeat in the Second World War. During the post-war occupation (and influenced by the views of some U.S. officials), various schemes including the complete abolition of kanji and exclusive use of rōmaji were considered. The _[jōyō kanji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C5%8Dy%C5%8D\_kanji "Jōyō kanji")_ ("common use kanji"), originally called _[tōyō kanji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C5%8Dy%C5%8D\_kanji "Tōyō kanji")_ (kanji for general use) scheme arose as a compromise solution.

Japanese students begin to learn kanji from their first year at elementary school. A guideline created by the Japanese Ministry of Education, the list of _[kyōiku kanji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ky%C5%8Diku\_kanji "Kyōiku kanji")_ ("education kanji", a subset of _[jōyō kanji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C5%8Dy%C5%8D\_kanji "Jōyō kanji")_), specifies the 1,006 simple characters a child is to learn by the end of sixth grade. Children continue to study another 1,130 characters in junior high school, covering in total 2,136 _jōyō kanji_. The official list of _jōyō kanji_ has been revised several times, but the total number of officially sanctioned characters has remained largely unchanged.

As for kanji for personal names, the circumstances are somewhat complicated. _Jōyō kanji_ and _[jinmeiyō kanji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinmeiy%C5%8D\_kanji "Jinmeiyō kanji")_ (an appendix of additional characters for names) are approved for registering personal names. Names containing unapproved characters are denied registration. However, as with the list of _jōyō kanji_, criteria for inclusion were often arbitrary and led to many common and popular characters being disapproved for use. Under popular pressure and following a court decision holding the exclusion of common characters unlawful, the list of _jinmeiyō kanji_ was substantially extended from 92 in 1951 (the year it was first decreed) to 983 in 2004. Furthermore, families whose names are not on these lists were permitted to continue using the older forms.

### Hiragana

_[Hiragana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiragana "Hiragana")_ are used for words without kanji representation, for words no longer written in kanji, for replacement of rare kanji that may be unfamiliar to intended readers, and also following kanji to show conjugational endings. Because of the way verbs (and adjectives) in Japanese are [conjugated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_conjugation "Japanese conjugation"), kanji alone cannot fully convey Japanese tense and mood, as kanji cannot be subject to variation when written without losing their meaning. For this reason, hiragana are appended to kanji to show verb and adjective conjugations. Hiragana used in this way are called [okurigana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okurigana "Okurigana"). Hiragana can also be written in a superscript called [furigana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furigana "Furigana") above or beside a kanji to show the proper reading. This is done to facilitate learning, as well as to clarify particularly old or obscure (or sometimes invented) readings.

### Katakana

_[Katakana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katakana "Katakana")_, like hiragana, constitute a [syllabary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllabary "Syllabary"); katakana are primarily used to write foreign words, plant and animal names, and for emphasis. For example, "Australia" has been adapted as _Ōsutoraria_ (オーストラリア), and "supermarket" has been adapted and shortened into _sūpā_ (スーパー).

Grammar
-------

### Sentence structure

Japanese word order is classified as [subject–object–verb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject%E2%80%93object%E2%80%93verb_word_order "Subject–object–verb word order"). Unlike many [Indo-European languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_languages "Indo-European languages"), the only strict rule of word order is that the verb must be placed at the end of a sentence (possibly followed by sentence-end particles). This is because Japanese sentence elements are marked with [particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_particles "Japanese particles") that identify their grammatical functions.

The basic sentence structure is [topic–comment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_and_comment "Topic and comment"). Once the topic has been stated using the particle _wa_ (は), it is normally omitted in subsequent sentences, and the next use of _wa_ will change the topic. For instance, someone may begin a conversation with a sentence that includes _Tanaka-san wa..._ (田中さんは..., "As for Mx. Tanaka, ..."). Each person may say a number of comments regarding Tanaka as the topic, and someone could change the topic to Naoko with a sentence including _Naoko-san wa..._ (直子さんは..., "As for Mx. Naoko, ...").

As these example translations illustrate, a sentence may include a topic, but the topic is not part of sentence's core statement. Japanese is often called a [topic-prominent language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic-prominent_language "Topic-prominent language") because of its strong tendency to indicate the topic separately from the subject, and the two do not always coincide. That is, a sentence might not involve the topic directly at all. To replicate this effect in English, consider "As for Naoko, people are rude." The topic, "Naoko," provides context to the comment about the subject, "people," and the sentence as a whole indicates that "people are rude" is a statement relevant to Naoko. However, the sentence's comment does not describe Naoko directly at all, and whatever the sentence indicates about Naoko is an inference. The topic is not the core of the sentence; the core of the sentence is always the comment.

In a basic comment, the subject is marked with the particle _ga_ (が), and the rest of the comment describes the subject. For example, in _Zou ga doubutsu da_ (象が動物だ), _ga_ indicates that "elephant" is the subject of the sentence. Context determines whether the speaker means a single elephant or elephants plural. The [copula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copula_(linguistics) "Copula (linguistics)")_da_ (だ, the verb "is") ends the sentence, indicating that the subject is equivalent to the rest of the comment. Here, _doubutsu_ means _animal_. Therefore, the sentence means "[The] elephant is [an] animal" or "Elephants are animals." A basic comment can end in three ways: with the copula _da_, with a different verb, or with an adjective ending in the kana _i_ (い). A sentence ending might also be decorated with particles that alter the way the sentence is meant to be interpreted, as in _Zou ga doubutsu da yo_ (象が動物だよ, "Elephants are animals, you know."). This is also why _da_ is replaced with _desu_ (です) when the speaker is talking to someone they do not know well: it makes the sentence more polite.

Often, _ga_ implies distinction of the subject within the topic, so the previous example comment would make the most sense within a topic where not all of the relevant subjects were animals. For example, in _Kono ganbutsu wa zou ga doubutsu da_ (この贋物は象が動物だ), the particle _wa_ indicates the topic is _kono ganbutsu_ ("this toy" or "these toys"). In English, if there are many toys and one is an elephant, this could mean "Among these toys, [the] elephant is [an] animal." That said, if the subject is clearly a subtopic, this differentiation effect may or may not be relevant, such as in _nihongo wa bunpo ga yasashii_ (日本語は文法が優しい). The equivalent sentence, "As for the Japanese language, grammar is easy," might be a general statement that Japanese grammar is easy or a statement that grammar is an especially easy feature of the Japanese language. Context should reveal which.

Because _ga_ marks the subject of the sentence but the sentence overall is intended to be relevant to the topic indicated by _wa_, translations of Japanese into English often elide the difference between these particles. For example, the phrase _watashi wa zou ga suki da_ literally means "As for myself, elephants are likeable." The sentence about myself describes elephants as having a likeable quality. From this, it is clear that I like elephants, and this sentence is often translated into English as "I like elephants." However, to do so changes the subject of the sentence (from "Elephant" to "I") and the verb (from "is" to "like"); it does not reflect Japanese grammar.

Japanese grammar tends toward brevity; the subject or object of a sentence need not be stated and [pronouns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pronoun "Pronoun") may be omitted if they can be inferred from context. In the example above, _zou ga doubutsu da_ would mean "[the] elephant is [an] animal", while _doubutsu da_ by itself would mean "[they] are animals." In especially casual speech, many speakers would omit the copula, leaving the noun _doubutsu_ to mean "[they are] animals." A single verb can be a complete sentence: _Yatta!_ (やった!, "[I / we / they / etc] did [it]!"). In addition, since adjectives can form the predicate in a Japanese sentence (below), a single adjective can be a complete sentence: _Urayamashii!_ (羨ましい!, "[I'm] jealous [about it]!")).

Nevertheless, unlike the topic, the subject is always implied: all sentences which omit a _ga_ particle must have an implied subject that could be specified with a _ga_ particle. For example, _Kono neko wa Loki da_ (この猫はロキだ) means "As for this cat, [it] is Loki." An equivalent sentence might read _kono neko wa kore ga Loki da_ (この猫はこれがロキだ), meaning "As for this cat, this is Loki." However, in the same way it is unusual to state the subject twice in the English sentence, it is unusual to specify that redundant subject in Japanese. Rather than replace the redundant subject with a word like "it," the redundant subject is omitted from the Japanese sentence. It is obvious from the context that the first sentence refers to the cat by the name "Loki," and the explicit subject of the second sentence contributes no information.

While the language has some words that are typically translated as pronouns, these are not used as frequently as pronouns in some Indo-European languages, and function differently. In some cases, Japanese relies on special verb forms and auxiliary verbs to indicate the direction of benefit of an action: "down" to indicate the out-group gives a benefit to the in-group, and "up" to indicate the in-group gives a benefit to the out-group. Here, the in-group includes the speaker and the out-group does not, and their boundary depends on context. For example, _oshiete moratta_ (教えてもらった; literally, "explaining got" with a benefit from the out-group to the in-group) means "[he/she/they] explained [it] to [me/us]". Similarly, _oshiete ageta_ (教えてあげた; literally, "explaining gave" with a benefit from the in-group to the out-group) means "[I/we] explained [it] to [him/her/them]". Such beneficiary auxiliary verbs thus serve a function comparable to that of pronouns and prepositions in Indo-European languages to indicate the actor and the recipient of an action.

[Japanese "pronouns"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_pronouns "Japanese pronouns") also function differently from most modern Indo-European pronouns (and more like nouns) in that they can take modifiers as any other noun may. For instance, one does not say in English:

> The amazed he ran down the street. (grammatically incorrect insertion of a pronoun)

But one _can_ grammatically say essentially the same thing in Japanese:

> 驚いた彼は道を走っていった。
> 
>  Transliteration: _Odoroita kare wa michi o hashitte itta._ (grammatically correct)

This is partly because these words evolved from regular nouns, such as _kimi_ "you" (君 "lord"), _anata_ "you" (あなた "that side, yonder"), and _boku_ "I" (僕 "servant"). This is why some linguists do not classify Japanese "pronouns" as pronouns, but rather as referential nouns, much like Spanish _usted_ (contracted from _vuestra merced_, "your ([majestic plural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_we "Royal we")) grace") or Portuguese _você_ (from _vossa mercê_). Japanese personal pronouns are generally used only in situations requiring special emphasis as to who is doing what to whom.

The choice of words used as pronouns is correlated with the sex of the speaker and the social situation in which they are spoken: men and women alike in a formal situation generally refer to themselves as _watashi_ (私; literally "private") or _watakushi_ (also 私, hyper-polite form), while men in rougher or intimate conversation are much more likely to use the word _ore_ (俺, "oneself", "myself") or _boku_. Similarly, different words such as _anata_, _kimi_, and _omae_ (お前, more formally 御前 "the one before me") may refer to a listener depending on the listener's relative social position and the degree of familiarity between the speaker and the listener. When used in different social relationships, the same word may have positive (intimate or respectful) or negative (distant or disrespectful) connotations.

Japanese often use titles of the person referred to where pronouns would be used in English. For example, when speaking to one's teacher, it is appropriate to use _sensei_ (先生, "teacher"), but inappropriate to use _anata_. This is because _anata_ is used to refer to people of equal or lower status, and one's teacher has higher status.

### Inflection and conjugation

Japanese nouns have no grammatical number, gender or article aspect. The noun _hon_ (本) may refer to a single book or several books; _hito_ (人) can mean "person" or "people", and _ki_ (木) can be "tree" or "trees". Where number is important, it can be indicated by providing a quantity (often with a [counter word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_counter_word "Japanese counter word")) or (rarely) by adding a suffix, or sometimes by duplication (e.g. 人人, _hitobito_, usually written with an iteration mark as 人々). Words for people are usually understood as singular. Thus _Tanaka-san_ usually means _Mx Tanaka_. Words that refer to people and animals can be made to indicate a group of individuals through the addition of a collective suffix (a noun suffix that indicates a group), such as _-tachi_, but this is not a true plural: the meaning is closer to the English phrase "and company". A group described as _Tanaka-san-tachi_ may include people not named Tanaka. Some Japanese nouns are effectively plural, such as _hitobito_ "people" and _wareware_ "we/us", while the word _tomodachi_ "friend" is considered singular, although plural in form.

Verbs are [conjugated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_conjugation "Japanese conjugation") to show tenses, of which there are two: past and non-past, which is used for the present and the future. For verbs that represent an ongoing process, the _-te iru_ form indicates a continuous (or progressive) [aspect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_aspect "Grammatical aspect"), similar to the suffix _ing_ in English. For others that represent a change of state, the _-te iru_ form indicates a perfect aspect. For example, _kite iru_ means "They have come (and are still here)", but _tabete iru_ means "They are eating".

Questions (both with an interrogative pronoun and yes/no questions) have the same structure as affirmative sentences, but with intonation rising at the end. In the formal register, the question particle _-ka_ is added. For example, _ii desu_ (いいです, "It is OK") becomes _ii desu-ka_ (いいですか。, "Is it OK?"). In a more informal tone sometimes the particle _-no_ (の) is added instead to show a personal interest of the speaker: _Dōshite konai-no?_ "Why aren't (you) coming?". Some simple queries are formed simply by mentioning the topic with an interrogative intonation to call for the hearer's attention: _Kore wa?_ "(What about) this?"; _O-namae wa?_ (お名前は？) "(What's your) name?".

Negatives are formed by inflecting the verb. For example, _Pan o taberu_ (パンを食べる。, "I will eat bread" or "I eat bread") becomes _Pan o tabenai_ (パンを食べない。, "I will not eat bread" or "I do not eat bread"). Plain negative forms are _i_-adjectives (see below) and inflect as such, e.g. _Pan o tabenakatta_ (パンを食べなかった。, "I did not eat bread").

The so-called _-te_ verb form is used for a variety of purposes: either progressive or perfect aspect (see above); combining verbs in a temporal sequence (_Asagohan o tabete sugu dekakeru_ "I'll eat breakfast and leave at once"), simple commands, conditional statements and permissions (_Dekakete-mo ii?_ "May I go out?"), etc.

The word _da_ (plain), _desu_ (polite) is the [copula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copula_(linguistics)#Japanese "Copula (linguistics)") verb. It corresponds to the English verb _is_ and marks tense when the verb is conjugated into its past form _datta_ (plain), _deshita_ (polite). This comes into use because only _i_-adjectives and verbs can carry tense in Japanese. Two additional common verbs are used to indicate existence ("there is") or, in some contexts, property: _aru_ (negative _nai_) and _iru_ (negative _inai_), for inanimate and animate things, respectively. For example, _Neko ga iru_ "There's a cat", _Ii kangae-ga nai_ "[I] haven't got a good idea".

The verb "to do" (_suru_, polite form _shimasu_) is often used to make verbs from nouns (_ryōri suru_ "to cook", _benkyō suru_ "to study", etc.) and has been productive in creating modern slang words. Japanese also has a huge number of compound verbs to express concepts that are described in English using a verb and an adverbial particle (e.g. _tobidasu_ "to fly out, to flee", from _tobu_ "to fly, to jump" + _dasu_ "to put out, to emit").

There are three types of adjectives (see [Japanese adjectives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_adjectives "Japanese adjectives")):

1.   形容詞 _keiyōshi_, or _i_ adjectives, which have a [conjugating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_conjugation "Japanese conjugation") ending _i_ (い). An example of this is 暑い (_atsui_, "to be hot"), which can become past (暑かった _atsukatta_ "it was hot"), or negative (暑くない _atsuku nai_ "it is not hot"). _nai_ is also an _i_ adjective, which can become past (i.e., 暑くなかった _atsuku nakatta_ "it was not hot"). 暑い日 _atsui hi_ "a hot day".
2.   形容動詞 _keiyōdōshi_, or _na_ adjectives, which are followed by a form of the [copula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copula_(linguistics) "Copula (linguistics)"), usually _na_. For example, _hen_ (strange) 変な人 _hen na hito_ "a strange person".
3.   連体詞 _rentaishi_, also called true adjectives, such as _ano_ "that" あの山 _ano yama_ "that mountain".

Both _keiyōshi_ and _keiyōdōshi_ may [predicate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predicate_(grammar) "Predicate (grammar)") sentences. For example,

> ご飯が熱い。_Gohan ga atsui._ "The rice is hot."
> 
> 彼は変だ。_Kare wa hen da._ "He's strange."

Both inflect, though they do not show the full range of conjugation found in true verbs. The _rentaishi_ in Modern Japanese are few in number, and unlike the other words, are limited to directly modifying nouns. They never predicate sentences. Examples include _ookina_ "big", _kono_ "this", _iwayuru_ "so-called" and _taishita_ "amazing".

Both _keiyōdōshi_ and _keiyōshi_ form [adverbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverb "Adverb"), by following with _ni_ in the case of _keiyōdōshi_:

> 変になる _hen ni naru_ "become strange",

and by changing _i_ to _ku_ in the case of _keiyōshi_:

> 熱くなる _atsuku naru_ "become hot".

The grammatical function of nouns is indicated by [postpositions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adposition "Adposition"), also called [particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_particles "Japanese particles"). These include for example:

*   **が _ga_** for the [nominative case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominative_case "Nominative case").

**彼が**やった。_**Kare ga** yatta._ "He did it."
*   **を _o_** for the [accusative case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accusative_case "Accusative case").

**何を**食べますか。_**Nani o** tabemasu ka?_ "**What** will (you) eat?"
*   **に _ni_** for the [dative case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dative_case "Dative case").

**田中さんに**あげて下さい。_**Tanaka-san ni** agete kudasai_ "Please give it **to Mx Tanaka**."It is also used for the [lative case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lative_case "Lative case"), indicating a motion to a location.**日本に**行きたい。_**Nihon ni** ikitai_ "I want to go **to Japan**."
*   However, **へ _e_** is more commonly used for the lative case.

**パーティーへ**行かないか。_**pātī e** ikanai ka?_ "Won't you go **to the party**?"
*   **の _no_** for the [genitive case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genitive_case "Genitive case"),[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#cite_note-57) or nominalizing phrases.

**私の**カメラ。_**watashi no** kamera_ "**my** camera"スキーに行く**の**が好きです。_Sukī-ni iku **no** ga suki desu_ "(I) like go**ing** skiing."
*   **は _wa_** for the topic. It can co-exist with the case markers listed above, and it overrides _ga_ and (in most cases) _o_.

**私は**寿司がいいです。_**Watashi wa** sushi ga ii desu._ (literally) "**As for me**, sushi is good." The nominative marker _ga_ after _watashi_ is hidden under _wa_.
Note: The subtle difference between _**wa**_ and _**ga**_ in Japanese cannot be derived from the English language as such, because the distinction between sentence topic and subject is not made there. While _wa_ indicates the topic, which the rest of the sentence describes or acts upon, it carries the implication that the subject indicated by _wa_ is not unique, or may be part of a larger group.

> _Ikeda-san **wa** yonjū-ni sai da._ "As for Mx Ikeda, they are forty-two years old." Others in the group may also be of that age.

Absence of _wa_ often means the subject is the [focus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_(linguistics) "Focus (linguistics)") of the sentence.

> _Ikeda-san **ga** yonjū-ni sai da._ "It is Mx Ikeda who is forty-two years old." This is a reply to an implicit or explicit question, such as "who in this group is forty-two years old?"

### Politeness

Japanese has an extensive grammatical system to express politeness and formality. This reflects the hierarchical nature of Japanese society.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#cite_note-58)

The Japanese language can express differing levels of social status. The differences in social position are determined by a variety of factors including job, age, experience, or even psychological state (e.g., a person asking a favour tends to do so politely). The person in the lower position is expected to use a polite form of speech, whereas the other person might use a plainer form. Strangers will also speak to each other politely. Japanese children begin learning and using polite speech in basic forms from an early age, but their use of more formal and sophisticated polite speech becomes more common and expected as they enter their teenage years and start engaging in more adult-like social interactions. See _[uchi–soto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uchi%E2%80%93soto "Uchi–soto")_.

Whereas _teineigo_ (丁寧語, polite language) is commonly an [inflectional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflection "Inflection") system, _sonkeigo_ (尊敬語, respectful language) and _kenjōgo_ (謙譲語, humble language) often employ many special honorific and humble alternate verbs: _iku_ "go" becomes _ikimasu_ in polite form, but is replaced by _irassharu_ in honorific speech and _ukagau_ or _mairu_ in humble speech.

The difference between honorific and humble speech is particularly pronounced in the Japanese language. Humble language is used to talk about oneself or one's own group (company, family) whilst honorific language is mostly used when describing the interlocutor and their group. For example, the _-san_ suffix ("Mr", "Mrs", "Miss", or "Mx") is an example of honorific language. It is not used to talk about oneself or when talking about someone from one's company to an external person, since the company is the speaker's in-group. When speaking directly to one's superior in one's company or when speaking with other employees within one's company about a superior, a Japanese person will use vocabulary and inflections of the honorific register to refer to the in-group superior and their speech and actions. When speaking to a person from another company (i.e., a member of an out-group), however, a Japanese person will use the plain or the humble register to refer to the speech and actions of their in-group superiors. In short, the register used in Japanese to refer to the person, speech, or actions of any particular individual varies depending on the relationship (either in-group or out-group) between the speaker and listener, as well as depending on the relative status of the speaker, listener, and third-person referents.

Most [nouns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noun "Noun") in the Japanese language may be made polite by the addition of _o-_ or _go-_ as a prefix. _o-_ is generally used for words of native Japanese origin, whereas _go-_ is affixed to words of Chinese derivation. In some cases, the prefix has become a fixed part of the word, and is included even in regular speech, such as _gohan_ 'cooked rice; meal.' Such a construction often indicates deference to either the item's owner or to the object itself. For example, the word _tomodachi_ 'friend,' would become _o-tomodachi_ when referring to the friend of someone of higher status (though mothers often use this form to refer to their children's friends). On the other hand, a polite speaker may sometimes refer to _mizu_ 'water' as _o-mizu_ to show politeness.

Vocabulary
----------

There are three main sources of words in the Japanese language: the _yamato kotoba_ (大和言葉) or _wago_ (和語); _kango_ (漢語); and _gairaigo_ (外来語).[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#cite_note-59)

The original language of Japan, or at least the original language of a certain population that was ancestral to a significant portion of the historical and present Japanese nation, was the so-called _[yamato kotoba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamato\_kotoba "Yamato kotoba")_ (大和言葉) or infrequently 大和詞, i.e. "[Yamato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamato_people "Yamato people") words"), which in scholarly contexts is sometimes referred to as _wago_ (和語 or rarely 倭語, i.e. the "[Wa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wa_(name_of_Japan) "Wa (name of Japan)") language"). In addition to words from this original language, present-day Japanese includes a number of words that were either borrowed from [Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language "Chinese language") or constructed from Chinese roots following Chinese patterns. These words, known as _[kango](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Japanese\_vocabulary "Sino-Japanese vocabulary")_ (漢語), entered the language from the 5th century[_[clarification needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please\_clarify "Wikipedia:Please clarify")_] onwards by contact with Chinese culture. According to the _Shinsen Kokugo Jiten_ (新選国語辞典)[Japanese dictionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_dictionary "Japanese dictionary"), _kango_ comprise 49.1% of the total vocabulary, _wago_ make up 33.8%, other foreign words or _[gairaigo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gairaigo "Gairaigo")_ (外来語) account for 8.8%, and the remaining 8.3% constitute hybridized words or _konshugo_ (混種語) that draw elements from more than one language.[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#cite_note-60)

There are also a great number of words of [mimetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimesis "Mimesis") origin in Japanese, with Japanese having a rich collection of [sound symbolism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_sound_symbolism "Japanese sound symbolism"), both [onomatopoeia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onomatopoeia "Onomatopoeia") for physical sounds, and more [abstract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction "Abstraction") words. A small number of words have come into Japanese from the [Ainu language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ainu_language "Ainu language"). _Tonakai_ ([reindeer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reindeer "Reindeer")), _rakko_ ([sea otter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_otter "Sea otter")) and _[shishamo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shishamo "Shishamo")_ ([smelt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smelt_(fish) "Smelt (fish)"), a type of fish) are well-known examples of words of Ainu origin.

Words of different origins occupy different [registers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register_(sociolinguistics) "Register (sociolinguistics)") in Japanese. Like Latin-derived words in English, _kango_ words are typically perceived as somewhat formal or academic compared to equivalent Yamato words. Indeed, it is generally fair to say that an English word derived from Latin/French roots typically corresponds to a Sino-Japanese word in Japanese, whereas an [Anglo-Saxon word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English "Old English") would best be translated by a Yamato equivalent.

Incorporating vocabulary from [European languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_Europe "Languages of Europe"), _gairaigo_, began with [borrowings from Portuguese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_Japanese_words_of_Portuguese_origin "Glossary of Japanese words of Portuguese origin") in the 16th century, followed by words from [Dutch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_language "Dutch language") during Japan's [long isolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sakoku "Sakoku") of the [Edo period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edo_period "Edo period"). With the [Meiji Restoration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiji_Restoration "Meiji Restoration") and the reopening of Japan in the 19th century, words were borrowed from [German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language "German language"), [French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language "French language"), and [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language "English language"). Today most borrowings are from English.

In the Meiji era, the Japanese also coined many neologisms using Chinese roots and morphology to translate European concepts;[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] these are known as _[wasei-kango](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasei-kango "Wasei-kango")_ (Japanese-made Chinese words). Many of these were then imported into Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese via their kanji in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] For example, _seiji_ (政治, "politics"), and _kagaku_ (化学, "chemistry") are words derived from Chinese roots that were first created and used by the Japanese, and only later borrowed into Chinese and other East Asian languages. As a result, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese share a large common corpus of vocabulary in the same way many Greek- and Latin-derived words – both inherited or borrowed into European languages, or modern coinages from Greek or Latin roots – are shared among modern European languages – see [classical compound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_compound "Classical compound").[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

In the past few decades, _[wasei-eigo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasei-eigo "Wasei-eigo")_ ("made-in-Japan English") has become a prominent phenomenon. Words such as _wanpatān_ ワンパターン (<_one_ + _pattern_, "to be in a rut", "to have a one-track mind") and _sukinshippu_ スキンシップ (<_skin_ + _-ship_, "physical contact"), although coined by compounding English roots, are nonsensical in most non-Japanese contexts; exceptions exist in nearby languages such as Korean however, which often use words such as _skinship_ and _rimokon_ (remote control) in the same way as in Japanese.

The popularity of many Japanese cultural exports has made some native Japanese words familiar in English, including _[emoji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji "Emoji"), [futon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futon "Futon"), [haiku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiku "Haiku"), [judo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judo "Judo"), [kamikaze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamikaze "Kamikaze"), [karaoke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karaoke "Karaoke"), [karate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karate "Karate"), [ninja](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninja "Ninja"), [origami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origami "Origami"), [rickshaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulled\_rickshaw "Pulled rickshaw")_ (from 人力車 _jinrikisha_), _[samurai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samurai "Samurai"), [sayonara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayonara\_(disambiguation) "Sayonara (disambiguation)"), [Sudoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku "Sudoku"), [sumo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumo "Sumo"), [sushi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sushi "Sushi"), [tofu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tofu "Tofu"), [tsunami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsunami "Tsunami"), [tycoon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tycoon "Tycoon")_. See [list of English words of Japanese origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_English_words_of_Japanese_origin "List of English words of Japanese origin") for more.

Gender in the Japanese language
-------------------------------

Depending on the speakers’ gender, different linguistic features might be used.[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#cite_note-:0-61) The typical [lect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(linguistics) "Variety (linguistics)") used by females is called _joseigo_ ([女性語](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%A5%B3%E6%80%A7%E8%AA%9E#Japanese "wikt:女性語")) and the one used by males is called _danseigo_ ([男性語](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E7%94%B7%E6%80%A7%E8%AA%9E#Japanese "wikt:男性語")).[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#cite_note-62)_Joseigo_ and _danseigo_ are different in various ways, including [first-person pronouns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_pronoun "Personal pronoun") (such as _watashi_ or _atashi_[私](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E7%A7%81#Japanese#Japanese "wikt:私") for women and _boku_ ([僕](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%83%95#Japanese "wikt:僕")) for men) and sentence-final particles (such as _wa_ ([わ](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E3%82%8F "wikt:わ")), _na no_ ([なの](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E3%81%AA%E3%81%AE "wikt:なの")), or _kashira_ ([かしら](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E3%81%8B%E3%81%97%E3%82%89 "wikt:かしら")) for _joseigo_, or _zo_ ([ぞ](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E3%81%9E "wikt:ぞ")), _da_ ([だ](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E3%81%A0 "wikt:だ")), or _yo_ ([よ](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E3%82%88 "wikt:よ")) for _danseigo_).[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#cite_note-:0-61) In addition to these specific differences, expressions and pitch can also be different.[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#cite_note-:0-61) For example, _joseigo_ is more gentle, polite, refined, indirect, modest, and exclamatory, and often accompanied by raised pitch.[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#cite_note-:0-61)

### Kogal slang

In the 1990s, the traditional feminine speech patterns and stereotyped behaviors were challenged, and a popular culture of "naughty" teenage girls emerged, called _kogyaru_ ([コギャル](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E3%82%B3%E3%82%AE%E3%83%A3%E3%83%AB "wikt:コギャル")), sometimes referenced in English-language materials as "kogal".[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#cite_note-:1-63) Their rebellious behaviors, deviant language usage, the particular make-up called _ganguro_ ([ガングロ](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E3%82%AC%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B0%E3%83%AD "wikt:ガングロ")), and the fashion became objects of focus in the mainstream media.[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#cite_note-:1-63) Although kogal slang was not appreciated by older generations, the _kogyaru_ continued to create terms and expressions.[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#cite_note-:1-63) Kogal culture also changed Japanese norms of gender and the Japanese language.[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#cite_note-:1-63)

Non-native study
----------------

Many major universities throughout the world provide Japanese language courses, and a number of secondary and even primary schools worldwide offer courses in the language. This is a significant increase from before [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II"); in 1940, only 65 Americans not [of Japanese descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_Americans "Japanese Americans") were able to read, write, and understand the language.[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#cite_note-64)

International interest in the Japanese language dates from the 19th century but has become more prevalent following Japan's economic bubble of the 1980s and the global popularity of [Japanese popular culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_popular_culture "Japanese popular culture") (such as [anime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime "Anime") and [video games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game "Video game")) since the 1990s. As of 2015, more than 3.6 million people studied the language worldwide, primarily in East and Southeast Asia.[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#cite_note-Japanese_as_Foreign_Language-65) Nearly one million Chinese, 745,000 Indonesians, 556,000 South Koreans and 357,000 Australians studied Japanese in lower and higher educational institutions.[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#cite_note-Japanese_as_Foreign_Language-65) Between 2012 and 2015, considerable growth of learners originated in [Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia "Australia") (20.5%), [Thailand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand "Thailand") (34.1%), [Vietnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam "Vietnam") (38.7%) and the [Philippines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines "Philippines") (54.4%).[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language#cite_note-Japanese_as_Foreign_Language-65)

The Japanese government provides standardized tests to measure spoken and written comprehension of Japanese for second language learners; the most prominent is the [Japanese-Language Proficiency Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese-Language_Proficiency_Test "Japanese-Language Proficiency Test") (JLPT), which features five levels of exams. The JLPT is offered twice a year.
