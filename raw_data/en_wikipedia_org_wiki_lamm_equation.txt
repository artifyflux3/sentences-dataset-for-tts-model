(Cells of
other shapes require much more complex equations.) It was named after Ole Lamm , later professor of physical chemistry at the Royal Institute of Technology , who derived it during his PhD studies under Svedberg at Uppsala University .

The Lamm equation can be written: [ 2 ] [ 3 ] ∂ ∂ c ∂ ∂ t = D [ ( ∂ ∂ 2 c ∂ ∂ r 2 ) + 1 r ( ∂ ∂ c ∂ ∂ r ) ] − − s ω ω 2 [ r ( ∂ ∂ c ∂ ∂ r ) + 2 c ] {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial c}{\partial t}}=D\left[\left({\frac {\partial ^{2}c}{\partial r^{2}}}\right)+{\frac {1}{r}}\left({\frac {\partial c}{\partial r}}\right)\right]-s\omega ^{2}\left[r\left({\frac {\partial c}{\partial r}}\right)+2c\right]} where c is the solute concentration, t and r are the time and radius, and  the parameters D , s , and ω represent the solute diffusion constant, sedimentation coefficient and the rotor angular velocity , respectively.  The first and second terms on the right-hand side of the Lamm equation are proportional to D and sω 2 , respectively, and describe the competing processes of diffusion and sedimentation .  Whereas sedimentation seeks to concentrate the solute near the outer radius of the cell, diffusion seeks to equalize the solute concentration throughout the cell.  The diffusion constant D can be estimated from the hydrodynamic radius and shape of the solute, whereas the buoyant mass m b can be determined from the ratio of s and D s D = m b k B T {\displaystyle {\frac {s}{D}}={\frac {m_{b}}{k_{\text{B}}T}}} where k B T is the thermal energy, i.e., the Boltzmann constant k B multiplied by
the absolute temperature T .

Solute molecules cannot pass through the inner and outer walls of the
cell, resulting in the boundary conditions on the Lamm equation D ( ∂ ∂ c ∂ ∂ r ) − − s ω ω 2 r c = 0 {\displaystyle D\left({\frac {\partial c}{\partial r}}\right)-s\omega ^{2}rc=0} at the inner and outer radii, r a and r b , respectively. By spinning samples at constant angular velocity ω and observing the variation in the concentration c ( r , t ), one may estimate the parameters s and D and, thence, the (effective or equivalent) buoyant mass of the solute.
