Special affine curvature , also known as the equiaffine curvature or affine curvature , is a particular type of curvature that is defined on a plane curve that remains unchanged under a special affine transformation (an affine transformation that preserves area ).  The curves of constant equiaffine curvature k are precisely all non-singular plane conics .  Those with k > 0 are ellipses , those with k = 0 are parabolae , and those with k < 0 are hyperbolae .

The usual Euclidean curvature of a curve at a point is the curvature of its osculating circle , the unique circle making second order contact (having three point contact) with the curve at the point. In the same way, the special affine curvature of a  curve at a point P is the special affine curvature of its hyperosculating conic , which is the unique conic making fourth order contact (having five point contact) with the curve at P . In other words, it is the limiting position of the (unique) conic through P and four points P 1 , P 2 , P 3 , P 4 on the curve, as each of the points approaches P : P 1 , P 2 , P 3 , P 4 → → P .

{\displaystyle P_{1},P_{2},P_{3},P_{4}\to P.} In some contexts, the affine curvature refers to a differential invariant κ of the general affine group , which may readily obtained from the special affine curvature k by κ = k − ⁠ 3 / 2 ⁠ ⁠ dk / ds ⁠ , where s is the special affine arc length.  Where the general affine group is not used, the special affine curvature k is sometimes also called the affine curvature.

[ 1 ] Formal definition [ edit ] Special affine arclength [ edit ] To define the special affine curvature, it is necessary first to define the special affine arclength (also called the equiaffine arclength ).  Consider an affine plane curve β ( t ) . Choose coordinates for the affine plane such that the area of the parallelogram spanned by two vectors a = ( a 1 , a 2 ) and b = ( b 1 , b 2 ) is given by the determinant det [ a b ] = a 1 b 2 − − a 2 b 1 .

{\displaystyle \det {\begin{bmatrix}a&b\end{bmatrix}}=a_{1}b_{2}-a_{2}b_{1}.} In particular, the determinant det [ d β β d t d 2 β β d t 2 ] {\displaystyle \det {\begin{bmatrix}{\dfrac {d\beta }{dt}}&{\dfrac {d^{2}\beta }{dt^{2}}}\end{bmatrix}}} is a well-defined invariant of the special affine group, and gives the signed area of the parallelogram spanned by the velocity and acceleration of the curve β .  Consider a reparameterization of the curve β , say with a new parameter s related to t by means of a regular reparameterization s = s ( t ) .  This determinant undergoes then a transformation of the following sort, by the chain rule : det [ d β β d t d 2 β β d t 2 ] = det [ d β β d s d s d t ( d 2 β β d s 2 ( d s d t ) 2 + d β β d s d 2 s d t 2 ) ] = ( d s d t ) 3 det [ d β β d s d 2 β β d s 2 ] .

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\det {\begin{bmatrix}{\dfrac {d\beta }{dt}}&{\dfrac {d^{2}\beta }{dt^{2}}}\end{bmatrix}}&=\det {\begin{bmatrix}{\dfrac {d\beta }{ds}}{\dfrac {ds}{dt}}&\left({\dfrac {d^{2}\beta }{ds^{2}}}\left({\dfrac {ds}{dt}}\right)^{2}+{\dfrac {d\beta }{ds}}{\dfrac {d^{2}s}{dt^{2}}}\right)\end{bmatrix}}\\&=\left({\frac {ds}{dt}}\right)^{3}\det {\begin{bmatrix}{\dfrac {d\beta }{ds}}&{\dfrac {d^{2}\beta }{ds^{2}}}\end{bmatrix}}.\end{aligned}}} The reparameterization can be chosen so that det [ d β β d s d 2 β β d s 2 ] = 1 {\displaystyle \det {\begin{bmatrix}{\dfrac {d\beta }{ds}}&{\dfrac {d^{2}\beta }{ds^{2}}}\end{bmatrix}}=1} provided the velocity and acceleration, ⁠ dβ / dt ⁠ and ⁠ d 2 β / dt 2 ⁠ are linearly independent .  Existence and uniqueness of such a parameterization follows by integration: s ( t ) = ∫ ∫ a t det [ d β β d t d 2 β β d t 2 ] 3 d t .

{\displaystyle s(t)=\int _{a}^{t}{\sqrt[{3}]{\det {\begin{bmatrix}{\dfrac {d\beta }{dt}}&{\dfrac {d^{2}\beta }{dt^{2}}}\end{bmatrix}}}}\,\,dt.} This integral is called the special affine arclength , and a curve carrying this parameterization is said to be parameterized with respect to its special affine arclength.

Special affine curvature [ edit ] Suppose that β ( s ) is a curve parameterized with its special affine arclength.  Then the special affine curvature (or equiaffine curvature ) is given by k ( s ) = det [ β β ″ ( s ) β β ‴ ( s ) ] .

{\displaystyle k(s)=\det {\begin{bmatrix}\beta ''(s)&\beta '''(s)\end{bmatrix}}.} Here β ′ denotes the derivative of β with respect to s .

More generally, [ 2 ] [ 3 ] for a plane curve with arbitrary parameterization t ↦ ↦ ( x ( t ) , y ( t ) ) , {\displaystyle t\mapsto {\bigl (}x(t),y(t){\bigr )},} the special affine curvature is: k ( t ) = x ″ y ‴ − − x ‴ y ″ ( x ′ y ″ − − x ″ y ′ ) 5 3 − − 1 2 ( 1 ( x ′ y ″ − − x ″ y ′ ) 2 3 ) ″ = 4 ( x ″ y ‴ − − x ‴ y ″ ) + ( x ′ y ⁗ − − x ⁗ y ′ ) 3 ( x ′ y ″ − − x ″ y ′ ) 5 3 − − 5 ( x ′ y ‴ − − x ‴ y ′ ) 2 9 ( x ′ y ″ − − x ″ y ′ ) 8 3 {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}k(t)&={\frac {x''y'''-x'''y''}{\left(x'y''-x''y'\right)^{\frac {5}{3}}}}-{\frac {1}{2}}\left({\frac {1}{\left(x'y''-x''y'\right)^{\frac {2}{3}}}}\right)''\\[6px]&={\frac {4\left(x''y'''-x'''y''\right)+\left(x'y''''-x''''y'\right)}{3\left(x'y''-x''y'\right)^{\frac {5}{3}}}}-{\frac {5\left(x'y'''-x'''y'\right)^{2}}{9\left(x'y''-x''y'\right)^{\frac {8}{3}}}}\end{aligned}}} provided the first and second derivatives of the curve are linearly independent.  In the special case of a graph y = y ( x ) , these formulas reduce to k = − − 1 2 ( 1 ( y ″ ) 2 3 ) ″ = y ⁗ 3 ( y ″ ) 5 3 − − 5 ( y ‴ ) 2 9 ( y ″ ) 8 3 {\displaystyle k=-{\frac {1}{2}}\left({\frac {1}{\left(y''\right)^{\frac {2}{3}}}}\right)''={\frac {y''''}{3\left(y''\right)^{\frac {5}{3}}}}-{\frac {5\left(y'''\right)^{2}}{9\left(y''\right)^{\frac {8}{3}}}}} where the prime denotes differentiation with respect to x .

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] Affine curvature [ edit ] Suppose as above that β ( s ) is a curve parameterized by special affine arclength.  There are a pair of invariants of the curve that are invariant under the full general affine group [ 1 ] — the group of all affine motions of the plane, not just those that are area-preserving.  The first of these is σ σ = ∫ ∫ k ( s ) d s , {\displaystyle \sigma =\int {\sqrt {k(s)}}\,ds,} sometimes called the affine arclength (although this risks confusion with the special affine arclength described above).  The second is referred to as the affine curvature : κ κ = k − − 3 2 d k d s .

{\displaystyle \kappa =k^{-{\frac {3}{2}}}{\frac {dk}{ds}}.} Conics [ edit ] Suppose that β ( s ) is a curve parameterized by special affine arclength with constant affine curvature k .  Let C β β ( s ) = [ β β ′ ( s ) β β ″ ( s ) ] .

{\displaystyle C_{\beta }(s)={\begin{bmatrix}\beta '(s)&\beta ''(s)\end{bmatrix}}.} Note that det( C β ) = 1 since β is assumed to carry the special affine arclength parameterization, and that k = det ( C β β ′ ) .

{\displaystyle k=\det \left(C_{\beta }'\right).\,} It follows from the form of C β that C β β ′ = C β β [ 0 − − k 1 0 ] .

{\displaystyle C_{\beta }'=C_{\beta }{\begin{bmatrix}0&-k\\1&0\end{bmatrix}}.} By applying a suitable special affine transformation, we can arrange that C β (0) = I is the identity matrix .  Since k is constant, it follows that C β is given by the matrix exponential C β β ( s ) = exp ⁡ ⁡ { s ⋅ ⋅ [ 0 − − k 1 0 ] } = [ cos ⁡ ⁡ k s k sin ⁡ ⁡ k s − − 1 k sin ⁡ ⁡ k s cos ⁡ ⁡ k s ] .

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}C_{\beta }(s)&=\exp \left\{s\cdot {\begin{bmatrix}0&-k\\1&0\end{bmatrix}}\right\}\\&={\begin{bmatrix}\cos {\sqrt {k}}\,s&{\sqrt {k}}\sin {\sqrt {k}}\,s\\-{\frac {1}{\sqrt {k}}}\sin {\sqrt {k}}\,s&\cos {\sqrt {k}}\,s\end{bmatrix}}.\end{aligned}}} The three cases are now as follows.

k = 0 If the curvature vanishes identically, then upon passing to a limit, C β β ( s ) = [ 1 0 s 1 ] {\displaystyle C_{\beta }(s)={\begin{bmatrix}1&0\\s&1\end{bmatrix}}} so β ′( s ) = (1, s ) , and so integration gives β β ( s ) = ( s , s 2 2 ) {\displaystyle \beta (s)=\left(s,{\frac {s^{2}}{2}}\right)\,} up to an overall constant translation, which is the special affine parameterization of the parabola y = ⁠ x 2 / 2 ⁠ .

k > 0 If the special affine curvature is positive, then it follows that β β ′ ( s ) = ( cos ⁡ ⁡ k s , 1 k sin ⁡ ⁡ k s ) {\displaystyle \beta '(s)=\left(\cos {\sqrt {k}}\,s,{\frac {1}{\sqrt {k}}}\sin {\sqrt {k}}\,s\right)} so that β β ( s ) = ( 1 k sin ⁡ ⁡ k s , − − 1 k cos ⁡ ⁡ k s ) {\displaystyle \beta (s)=\left({\frac {1}{\sqrt {k}}}\sin {\sqrt {k}}\,s,-{\frac {1}{k}}\cos {\sqrt {k}}\,s\right)} up to a translation, which is the special affine parameterization of the ellipse kx 2 + k 2 y 2 = 1 .

k < 0 If k is negative, then the trigonometric functions in C β give way to hyperbolic functions : C β β ( s ) = [ cosh ⁡ ⁡ | k | s | k | sinh ⁡ ⁡ | k | s 1 | k | sinh ⁡ ⁡ | k | s cosh ⁡ ⁡ | k | s ] .

{\displaystyle C_{\beta }(s)={\begin{bmatrix}\cosh {\sqrt {|k|}}\,s&{\sqrt {|k|}}\sinh {\sqrt {|k|}}\,s\\{\frac {1}{\sqrt {|k|}}}\sinh {\sqrt {|k|}}\,s&\cosh {\sqrt {|k|}}\,s\end{bmatrix}}.} Thus β β ( s ) = ( 1 | k | sinh ⁡ ⁡ | k | s , 1 | k | cosh ⁡ ⁡ | k | s ) {\displaystyle \beta (s)=\left({\frac {1}{\sqrt {|k|}}}\sinh {\sqrt {|k|}}\,s,{\frac {1}{|k|}}\cosh {\sqrt {|k|}}\,s\right)} up to a translation, which is the special affine parameterization of the hyperbola − − | k | x 2 + | k | 2 y 2 = 1.

{\displaystyle -|k|x^{2}+|k|^{2}y^{2}=1.} Characterization up to affine congruence [ edit ] The special affine curvature of an immersed curve is the only (local) invariant of the curve in the following sense: If two curves have the same special affine curvature at every point, then one curve is obtained from the other by means of a special affine transformation.

In fact, a slightly stronger statement holds: Given any continuous function k : [ a , b ] → R , there exists a curve β whose first and second derivatives are linearly independent, such that the special affine curvature of β relative to the special affine parameterization is equal to the given function k .  The curve β is uniquely determined up to a special affine transformation.

This is analogous to the fundamental theorem of curves in the classical Euclidean differential geometry of curves , in which the complete classification of plane curves up to Euclidean motion depends on a single function κ , the curvature of the curve.  It follows essentially by applying the Picard–Lindelöf theorem to the system C β β ′ = C β β [ 0 − − k 1 0 ] {\displaystyle C_{\beta }'=C_{\beta }{\begin{bmatrix}0&-k\\1&0\end{bmatrix}}} where C β = [ β ′ β ″] .  An alternative approach, rooted in the theory of moving frames , is to apply the existence of a primitive for the Darboux derivative .

Derivation of the curvature by affine invariance [ edit ] The special affine curvature can be derived explicitly by techniques of invariant theory .  For simplicity, suppose that an affine plane curve is given in the form of a graph y = y ( x ) .  The special affine group acts on the Cartesian plane via transformations of the form x ↦ ↦ a x + b y + α α y ↦ ↦ c x + d y + β β , {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}x&\mapsto ax+by+\alpha \\y&\mapsto cx+dy+\beta ,\end{aligned}}} with ad − bc = 1 .  The following vector fields span the Lie algebra of infinitesimal generators of the special affine group: T 1 = ∂ ∂ x , T 2 = ∂ ∂ y X 1 = x ∂ ∂ y , X 2 = y ∂ ∂ x , H = x ∂ ∂ x − − y ∂ ∂ y .

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}T_{1}&=\partial _{x},&\quad T_{2}&=\partial _{y}\\X_{1}&=x\partial _{y},&\quad X_{2}&=y\partial _{x},&H&=x\partial _{x}-y\partial _{y}.\end{aligned}}} An affine transformation not only acts on points, but also on the tangent lines to graphs of the form y = y ( x ) .  That is, there is an action of the special affine group on triples of coordinates ( x , y , y ′) . The group action is generated by vector fields T 1 ( 1 ) , T 2 ( 1 ) , X 1 ( 1 ) , X 2 ( 1 ) , H ( 1 ) {\displaystyle T_{1}^{(1)},T_{2}^{(1)},X_{1}^{(1)},X_{2}^{(1)},H^{(1)}} defined on the space of three variables ( x , y , y ′) .  These vector fields can be determined by the following two requirements: Under the projection onto the xy -plane, they must to project to the corresponding original generators of the action T 1 , T 2 , X 1 , X 2 , H , respectively.

The vectors must preserve up to scale the contact structure of the jet space θ θ 1 = d y − − y ′ d x .

{\displaystyle \theta _{1}=dy-y'\,dx.} Concretely, this means that the generators X (1) must satisfy L X ( 1 ) θ θ 1 ≡ ≡ 0 ( mod θ θ 1 ) {\displaystyle L_{X^{(1)}}\theta _{1}\equiv 0{\pmod {\theta _{1}}}} where L is the Lie derivative .

Similarly, the action of the group can be extended to the space of any number of derivatives ( x , y , y ′, y ″,…, y ( k ) ) .

The prolonged vector fields generating the action of the special affine group must then inductively satisfy, for each generator X ∈ { T 1 , T 2 , X 1 , X 2 , H } : The projection of X ( k ) onto the space of variables ( x , y , y ′,…, y ( k −1) ) is X ( k −1) .

X ( k ) preserves the contact ideal: L X ( k ) θ θ k ≡ ≡ 0 ( mod θ θ 1 , … … , θ θ k ) {\displaystyle L_{X^{(k)}}\theta _{k}\equiv 0{\pmod {\theta _{1},\dots ,\theta _{k}}}} where θ θ i = d y ( i − − 1 ) − − y ( i ) d x .

{\displaystyle \theta _{i}=dy^{(i-1)}-y^{(i)}dx.} Carrying out the inductive construction up to order 4 gives T 1 ( 4 ) = ∂ ∂ x , T 2 ( 4 ) = ∂ ∂ y X 1 ( 4 ) = x ∂ ∂ y + ∂ ∂ y ′ X 2 ( 4 ) = y ∂ ∂ x − − y ′ 2 ∂ ∂ y ′ − − 3 y ′ y ″ ∂ ∂ y ″ − − ( 3 y ″ 2 + 4 y ′ y ‴ ) ∂ ∂ y ‴ − − ( 10 y ″ y ‴ + 5 y ′ y ⁗ ) ∂ ∂ y ⁗ H ( 4 ) = x ∂ ∂ x − − y ∂ ∂ y − − 2 y ′ ∂ ∂ y ′ − − 3 y ″ ∂ ∂ y ″ − − 4 y ‴ ∂ ∂ y ‴ − − 5 y ⁗ ∂ ∂ y ⁗ .

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}T_{1}^{(4)}&=\partial _{x},\qquad T_{2}^{(4)}=\partial _{y}\\X_{1}^{(4)}&=x\partial _{y}+\partial _{y'}\\X_{2}^{(4)}&=y\partial _{x}-y'^{2}\partial _{y'}-3y'y''\partial _{y''}-\left(3y''^{2}+4y'y'''\right)\partial _{y'''}-{\bigl (}10y''y'''+5y'y''''{\bigr )}\partial _{y''''}\\H^{(4)}&=x\partial _{x}-y\partial _{y}-2y'\partial _{y'}-3y''\partial _{y''}-4y'''\partial _{y'''}-5y''''\partial _{y''''}.\end{aligned}}} The special affine curvature k = y ⁗ 3 ( y ″ ) 5 3 − − 5 ( y ‴ ) 2 9 ( y ″ ) 8 3 {\displaystyle k={\frac {y''''}{3\left(y''\right)^{\frac {5}{3}}}}-{\frac {5\left(y'''\right)^{2}}{9\left(y''\right)^{\frac {8}{3}}}}} does not depend explicitly on x , y , or y ′ , and so satisfies T 1 ( 4 ) k = T 2 ( 4 ) k = X 1 ( 4 ) k = 0.

{\displaystyle T_{1}^{(4)}k=T_{2}^{(4)}k=X_{1}^{(4)}k=0.} The vector field H acts diagonally as a modified homogeneity operator , and it is readily verified that H (4) k = 0 .  Finally, X 2 ( 4 ) k = 1 2 [ H , X 1 ] ( 4 ) k = 1 2 [ H ( 4 ) , X 1 ( 4 ) ] k = 0.

{\displaystyle X_{2}^{(4)}k={\tfrac {1}{2}}\left[H,X_{1}\right]^{(4)}k={\tfrac {1}{2}}\left[H^{(4)},X_{1}^{(4)}\right]k=0.} The five vector fields T 1 ( 4 ) , T 2 ( 4 ) , X 1 ( 4 ) , X 2 ( 4 ) , H ( 4 ) {\displaystyle T_{1}^{(4)},T_{2}^{(4)},X_{1}^{(4)},X_{2}^{(4)},H^{(4)}} form an involutive distribution on (an open subset of) R 6 so that, by the Frobenius integration theorem , they integrate locally to give a foliation of R 6 by five-dimensional leaves.  Concretely, each leaf is a local orbit of the special affine group.  The function k parameterizes these leaves.

Human motor system [ edit ] Human curvilinear 2-dimensional drawing movements tend to follow the equiaffine parametrization.

[ 5 ] This is more commonly known as the two thirds power law , according to which the hand's speed is proportional to the Euclidean curvature raised to the minus third power.

[ 6 ] Namely, v = γ γ κ κ − − 1 3 , {\displaystyle v=\gamma \kappa ^{-{\frac {1}{3}}},} where v is the speed of the hand, κ is the Euclidean curvature and γ is a constant termed the velocity gain factor.
