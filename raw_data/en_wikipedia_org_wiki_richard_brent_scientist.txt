Golub George Forsythe Richard Peirce Brent is an Australian mathematician and computer scientist . He is an emeritus professor at the Australian National University .  From March 2005 to March 2010 he was a Federation Fellow [ 1 ] at the Australian National University . His research interests include number theory (in particular factorisation ), random number generators , computer architecture , and analysis of algorithms .

In 1973, he published a root-finding algorithm (an algorithm for solving equations numerically) which is now known as Brent's method .

[ 2 ] In 1975 he and Eugene Salamin independently conceived the Salamin–Brent algorithm , used in high-precision calculation of π π {\displaystyle \pi } . At the same time, he showed that all the elementary functions (such as log( x ), sin( x ) etc.) can be evaluated to high precision in the same time as π π {\displaystyle \pi } (apart from a small constant factor) using the arithmetic-geometric mean of Carl Friedrich Gauss .

[ 3 ] In 1979 he showed that the first 75 million complex zeros of the Riemann zeta function lie on the critical line, providing some experimental evidence for the Riemann hypothesis .

[ 4 ] In 1980 he and Nobel laureate Edwin McMillan found a new algorithm for high-precision computation of the Euler–Mascheroni constant γ γ {\displaystyle \gamma } using Bessel functions , and showed that γ γ {\displaystyle \gamma } can not have a simple rational form p / q (where p and q are integers ) unless q is extremely large (greater than 10 15000 ).

[ 5 ] In 1980 he and John Pollard factored the eighth Fermat number using a variant of the Pollard rho algorithm.

[ 6 ] He later factored the tenth [ 7 ] and eleventh Fermat numbers using Lenstra's elliptic curve factorisation algorithm.

In 2002, Brent, Samuli Larvala and Paul Zimmermann discovered a very large primitive trinomial over GF (2): x 6972593 + x 3037958 + 1.

{\displaystyle x^{6972593}+x^{3037958}+1.} The degree 6972593 is the exponent of a Mersenne prime .

[ 8 ] In 2009 and 2016, Brent and Paul Zimmermann discovered some even larger primitive trinomials, for example: x 43112609 + x 3569337 + 1.

{\displaystyle x^{43112609}+x^{3569337}+1.} The degree 43112609 is again the exponent of a Mersenne prime.

[ 9 ] The highest degree trinomials found were three trinomials of degree 74,207,281, also a Mersenne prime exponent.

[ 10 ] In 2011, Brent and Paul Zimmermann published Modern Computer Arithmetic ( Cambridge University Press ), a book about algorithms for performing arithmetic, and their implementation on modern computers.

Brent is a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery , the IEEE , SIAM and the Australian Academy of Science . In 2005, he was awarded the Hannan Medal by the Australian Academy of Science . In 2014, he was awarded the Moyal Medal by Macquarie University .
