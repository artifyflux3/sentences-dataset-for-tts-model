Personal and professional life [ edit ] Mayer, born in Göttingen in the Electorate of Hanover , was the first child of the astronomer Tobias Mayer and his wife Maria. The elder Mayer, a well-known Göttingen professor of geography, physics, and astronomy, died in 1762, when Johann was only ten.

Johann Tobias Mayer studied theology and philosophy since 1769 at the Georg-August University of Göttingen (founded 1737) under Abraham Gotthelf Kästner and later also with Georg Christoph Lichtenberg .  After graduating in 1773, Mayer worked as a lecturer in mathematics and as an astronomer.  On 17 November 1779, he was called to the University of Altdorf , where he worked from 1780 to 1786.  He later taught mathematics and physics at Friedrich-Alexander-University, Erlangen-Nuremberg , and in 1799, he succeeded Lichtenberg at Göttingen.  The mathematician Enno Dirksen was one of his doctoral students.

Mayer was well known for his mathematics and natural science textbooks . The textbook Anfangsgründe der Naturlehre zum Behuf der Vorlesungen über die Experimental-Physik from 1801 was the most influential of its time in the German-speaking countries. Mayer's research in experimental physics and astronomy was published in Annalen der Physik .

Mayer and his wife Johanna had five children. Mayer died in Göttingen.

The Leonardo da Vinci Proof of the Pythagorean Theorem [ edit ] A proof of the Pythagorean theorem ascribed to Leonardo da Vinci is now claimed to have been authored by Mayer in 1772.
