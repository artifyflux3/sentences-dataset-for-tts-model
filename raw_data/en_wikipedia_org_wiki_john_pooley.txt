[ 1 ] Career [ edit ] Born in Ipswich around 1645, Pooley was educated at St Patrick's Cathedral Grammar School, in Dublin , the future Duke of Marlborough being one of his classmates.

[ 2 ] He graduated from Trinity College , where he became a senior fellow .

[ 3 ] He was appointed the vicar of the Parish of Leixlip, St Mary's and served in this position from 1670 to 1674.

[ 4 ] He was appointed Prebendary of St. Michan's Church, Dublin , then Dean of Ossory on 6 March 1674.

[ 5 ] He served as personal chaplain to the Earl of Essex , Lord Lieutenant of Ireland from 1672 to 1677, as well as his successor, the Duke of Ormond . One of Ormond' positions was that of Chancellor of Oxford University , and Pooley was made Doctor of Divinity there in July 1682.

[ 2 ] On 2 December 1697, he was consecrated Bishop of Cloyne , spending much of his time on an unsuccessful legal campaign to regain episcopal lands lost in prior decades.

[ 2 ] In 1702, he became Bishop of Raphoe in Ulster , one of the more valuable sees; in 1714, Archbishop King described it as 'worth near £1,200...(but) full of Dissenters and Papists'. A contemporary complained in the eleven years he served as bishop, Pooley 'hardly resided eighteen months.' [ 6 ] As a bishop, Pooley sat in the Irish House of Lords and spoke against the 1703 Popery Act . He specifically objected to the requirement office holders abjure or deny the claim of the Catholic Stuart exiles, and avoided doing so himself until 1710.

[ 7 ] As a result, he was briefly deprived of his bishopric before having it restored in September 1710.

[ 8 ] He was briefly held in Dublin Castle in 1709 for protesting against a Parliamentary session being scheduled on a Holy day .

[ 2 ] Pooley was responsible for restoring St. Michan's Church, Dublin , described as being in a 'ruinous condition' in the 1680s, and the expansion of St Eunan's Cathedral . His will left £200 for a building programme, which was not completed until years after his death. Most of it was replaced in the late 19th century, apart from a baptismal font installed in 1706, which can still be seen.

[ 9 ] He died in Dublin on 16 October 1712, and was buried in St. Michan's.
