The current results from the flow of the Atlantic North Equatorial Current . This current completes the clockwise- cycle or convection ( North Atlantic Gyre ) that is located in the Atlantic Ocean .  It runs north of Puerto Rico , Hispaniola and Cuba , but south to the Bahamas , facilitating maritime communication from across the Atlantic into these islands' northern coasts, and connecting to the Gulf Stream at the intersection of the Florida Strait .  Because of its non-dominant pace and rich-nutrient waters, fishermen across the Caribbean Islands use it to fish. It moves almost parallel to the also rich-nutrient Caribbean Current which flows south of Puerto Rico and Cuba, and over Colombia and Venezuela .
