It lays the groundwork for the differential calculus . It consists of a single volume containing two internal books; there are 9 chapters in book I, and 18 in book II.

W. W. Rouse Ball ( 1888 ) writes that "this is the first textbook on the differential calculus which has any claim to be both complete and accurate, and it may be said that all modern treatises on the subject are based on it."
