It is sometimes also called a coherent space because of the connection to coherent topoi .

Definition [ edit ] Let X be a topological space and let K ∘ ∘ {\displaystyle \circ } ( X ) be the set of all compact open subsets of X . Then X is said to be spectral if it satisfies all of the following conditions: X is compact and T 0 .

K ∘ ∘ {\displaystyle \circ } ( X ) is a basis of open subsets of X .

K ∘ ∘ {\displaystyle \circ } ( X ) is closed under finite intersections.

X is sober , i.e., every nonempty irreducible closed subset of X has a (necessarily unique) generic point .

Equivalent descriptions [ edit ] Let X be a topological space. Each of the following properties are equivalent 
to the property of X being spectral: X is homeomorphic to a projective limit of finite T 0 -spaces .

X is homeomorphic to the spectrum of a bounded distributive lattice L . In this case, L is isomorphic (as a bounded lattice) to the lattice K ∘ ∘ {\displaystyle \circ } ( X ) (this is called Stone representation of distributive lattices ).

X is homeomorphic to the spectrum of a commutative ring .

X is the topological space determined by a Priestley space .

X is a T 0 space whose locale of open sets is coherent (and every coherent locale comes from a unique spectral space in this way).

Properties [ edit ] Let X be a spectral space and let K ∘ ∘ {\displaystyle \circ } ( X ) be as before. Then: K ∘ ∘ {\displaystyle \circ } ( X ) is a bounded sublattice of subsets of X .

Every closed subspace of X is spectral.

An arbitrary intersection of compact and open subsets of X (hence of elements from K ∘ ∘ {\displaystyle \circ } ( X )) is again spectral.

X is T 0 by definition, but in general not T 1 .

[ 1 ] In fact a spectral space is T 1 if and only if it is Hausdorff (or T 2 ) if and only if it is a boolean space if and only if K ∘ ∘ {\displaystyle \circ } ( X ) is a boolean algebra .

X can be seen as a pairwise Stone space .

[ 2 ] Spectral maps [ edit ] A spectral map f: X → Y between spectral spaces X and Y is a continuous map such that the preimage of every open and compact subset of Y under f is  again compact.

The category of spectral spaces, which has spectral maps as morphisms, is dually equivalent to the category of bounded distributive lattices (together with homomorphisms of such lattices).

[ 3 ] In this anti-equivalence, a spectral space X corresponds to the lattice K ∘ ∘ {\displaystyle \circ } ( X ).
