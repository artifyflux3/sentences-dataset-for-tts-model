It is the largest multicultural STEM diversity organization in the United States, [ 1 ] with a mission to advance the success of Chicano , Hispanic , and Native American students in obtaining advanced degrees, careers, leadership positions, and equality in the STEM field. It serves a community of over 20,000 members and has 118 student and professional chapters on college campuses across the United States and its territories.

[ 2 ] Background and history [ edit ] SACNAS started its programs in junior and high schools, extending support through undergraduate and graduate initiatives, with the primary aim of mentoring students from minority backgrounds. The society operates without discrimination against any group, providing assistance to students of various ethnicities, including African Americans, Asian Americans, and white students, as well as individuals in the social sciences.

[ 3 ] It is committed to expanding graduate and post-graduate funding opportunities for Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans, which enhances their representation in STEM fields.

[ 4 ] Between 2005 and 2010, SACNAS observed a 40% increase in participation for its annual conferences and expanded from 32 to 50 chapters on college campuses nationwide. The society's revenue also rose significantly, growing from $2.3 million to $3.8 million between 2007 and 2010.

[ 5 ] In April 2011, SACNAS released a strategic plan titled "Vision 2020", detailing its objectives for the 2010s which involve expanding membership, providing increased support for students and professionals, engaging in policy and advocacy to advance Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in STEM fields, fostering collaborations with other organizations and companies for scholarships and internships, and enhancing organizational capacity and technology.

[ 5 ] In 2013, the organization was recognized for using social media and online networking to diversify STEM fields and mitigate the geographic isolation faced by many minority groups striving to succeed in science.

[ 6 ] Programs [ edit ] Speakers at the 2018 National Diversity in STEM Conference SACNAS organizes various programs aimed at enhancing Chicano/Hispanic and Native American participation and success in science. As part of its strategy to support these students and professionals, SACNAS hosts the National Diversity in STEM Conference , an annual event featuring workshops, scientific presentations (including posters and oral presentations), motivational speakers, and networking opportunities.

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] SACNAS also offers scholarships covering lodging and travel expenses for the conference. Between 2005 and 2010, its student researcher participation increased from 543 to 883 individuals.

[ 5 ] SACNAS also organizes two leadership conferences annually with the objective of nurturing leadership skills and preparing minority groups for leadership roles in STEM fields at various levels.

[ 10 ] The organization boasts over 115 professional and student chapters nationwide, which offers local community and support, as well as opportunities in science, leadership, and personal development for its members. These chapters are encouraged to host two SACNAS Regional Meetings each spring, which provide an opportunity for neighboring chapters, members, high schools, and professionals to stay informed about upcoming events and opportunities. In addition, they serve as a platform for chapters to network and for students to share their research within a scientific community.

Within the broader SACNAS community, the society has established an online Native American community, which offers learning, teaching, networking, and mentoring resources for Native American students.

Governance [ edit ] board of directors [ edit ] The SACNAS board of directors provides governance and leadership, and supports fundraising efforts of the organization.

[ 11 ] The board is composed of ten members in total: four officers, seven members at large, two student members, and one board liaison. The board is represented by people with a broad spectrum of backgrounds and careers in STEM. For example, former President (2016–2018) Lino Gonzalez is a senior scientist at 23andMe ; current President (and former Secretary) Sonia Zárate is the Program Officer for Undergraduate and Graduate Science Education at Howard Hughes Medical Institute ; while Treasurer Patricia Silveyra and Secretary Corey Garza are both faculty at universities.

[ 11 ] Between 2001 and 2002, Maria Elena Zavala served as the Society's first Chicana president.
