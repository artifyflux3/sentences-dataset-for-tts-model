Structural discrimination is a form of institutional discrimination against individuals of a given protected characteristic, such as race , gender , caste , which has the effect of restricting their opportunities. It may be either intentional or unintentional, and it may involve either public or private institutional policies.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Such discrimination occurs when these policies have disproportionately negative effects on the opportunities of certain social groups .

[ 1 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Some conceptualizations of structural discrimination focus on past forms of discrimination that have resulted in present-day inequality, while others focus on policies that still exist today and can have disproportionately negative effects on minority groups .

[ 5 ] One overt past example of structural discrimination was Jim Crow laws in the Southern United States , which were explicitly aimed at limiting the rights of black Americans in education, employment, and other areas of society.
