For the 1990s band, see Lethargy (band) .

Lethargy is a state of tiredness, sleepiness, weariness, fatigue , sluggishness, or lack of energy. It can be accompanied by depression , decreased motivation, or apathy . Lethargy can be a normal response to inadequate sleep, overexertion, overworking, stress, lack of exercise, improper nutrition, drug abuse, boredom , or a symptom of an underlying illness or disorder. It may also be a side effect of medication or caused by an interaction between medications and alcohol . It may also be an altered level of consciousness .

[ 1 ] When part of a normal response, lethargy often resolves with rest, adequate sleep, decreased stress, physical exercise, and good nutrition.

[ 2 ] Its symptoms, however, can last days or even months, [ 3 ] so it can be a sign of a recent underlying illness or infection if it does not resolve normally.
