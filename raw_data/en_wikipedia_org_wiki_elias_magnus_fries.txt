Elias Fries in old age Building containing historical information on Elias Fries located in Femsjö Elias Magnus Fries FRS FRSE FLS (15 August 1794 – 8 February 1878) was a Swedish mycologist and botanist. He is sometimes called the "Linnaeus of Mycology" .

[ 1 ] In his works he described and assigned botanical names to hundreds of fungus and lichen species, many of which remain authoritative today.

Career [ edit ] Fries was born at Femsjö ( Hylte Municipality ), Småland , the son of the pastor there.

[ 2 ] He attended school in Växjö .

He acquired an extensive knowledge of flowering plants from his father.

[ 3 ] In 1811 Fries entered Lund University [ 3 ] where he studied under Carl Adolph Agardh and Anders Jahan Retzius .

[ 4 ] He obtained his doctorate in 1814. In the same year he was appointed an associate professorship in botany . Fries edited several exsiccata series, the first starting in 1818 under the title Lichenes Sveciae exsiccati, curante Elia Fries [ 5 ] and the last together with Franz Joseph Lagger under the title Hieracia europaea exsiccata .

[ 6 ] He was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences , and in 1824, became a full professor . In 1834 he became Borgström professor [ 3 ] (Swed.

Borgströmianska professuren , a chair endowed by Erik Eriksson Borgström , 1708–1770) in applied economics at Uppsala University . The position was changed to "professor of botany and applied economics" in 1851. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1849.

[ 7 ] That year he was also appointed director of the Uppsala University Botanical Garden . In 1853, he became rector of the University.

[ 8 ] Fries most important works were the three-volume Systema mycologicum (1821–1832), Elenchus fungorum (1828), the two-volume Monographia hymenomycetum Sueciae (1857 and 1863) and Hymenomycetes Europaei (1874).

[ 9 ] Fries is considered to be, after Christian Hendrik Persoon , a founding father of the modern taxonomy of mushrooms . His taxonomy of mushrooms was influenced by Goethe and the German romantics . He utilized spore color and arrangement of the hymenophore (pores, gills, teeth etc.) as major taxonomic characteristics.

[ 10 ] [ 11 ] He was one of the most prolific authors of new fungal species, having formally described 3210 in his career.

[ 12 ] Fries died in Uppsala on 8 February 1878.

[ 13 ] When he died, The Times commented: "His very numerous works, especially on fungi and lichens , give him a position as regards those groups of plants comparable only to that of Linnaeus ." [ 14 ] Fries was succeeded in the Borgström professorship (from 1859 to 1876) by Johan Erhard Areschoug , [ 15 ] after whom Theodor Magnus Fries , the son of Elias, held the chair (from 1877 to 1899).

[ 16 ] Publications [ edit ] Monographia Pyrenomycetum Sueciae (1816) Systema Mycologicum (1821) Systema Orbis Vegetabilis (1825) Elenchus Fungorem (1828) Lichenographia Europaea Reformata (1831) Epicrisis Systematis Mycologici: seu synopsis hymenomycetum (1838) Botanical reference [ edit ] The standard author abbreviation Fr.

is used to indicate this person as the author when citing a botanical name .

[ 17 ] Family [ edit ] His wife was Christina Wieslander (1808–1862), with whom he raised nine children. His son Theodor Magnus Fries became a botanist and lichenologist, eventually holding the Borgström professorship himself, and another son, Oscar Robert Fries, became a physician in Gothenburg while maintaining a keen interest in mycology.

[ 18 ] Theodor "Thore" Magnus's sons Thore Christian Elias Fries and Robert Elias Fries also became botanists.
