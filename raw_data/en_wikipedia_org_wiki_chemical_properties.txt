[ 1 ] Simply speaking, chemical properties cannot be determined just by viewing or touching the substance; the substance's internal structure must be affected greatly for its chemical properties to be investigated. When a substance goes under a chemical reaction, the properties will change drastically, resulting in chemical change . However, a catalytic property would also be a chemical property.

Chemical properties can be contrasted with physical properties , which can be discerned without changing the substance's structure. However, for many properties within the scope of physical chemistry , and other disciplines at the boundary between chemistry and physics , the distinction may be a matter of researcher's perspective .

Material properties , both physical and chemical, can be viewed as supervenient ; i.e., secondary to the underlying reality. Several layers of superveniency [ clarification needed ] are possible.

Chemical properties can be used for building chemical classifications . They can also be useful to identify an unknown substance or to separate or purify it from other substances.

Materials science will normally consider the chemical properties of a substance to guide its applications.
