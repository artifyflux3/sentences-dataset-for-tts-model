( July 2025 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) The Icelandic Low is a semi-permanent centre of low atmospheric pressure found between Iceland and southern Greenland and extending in the Northern Hemisphere winter into the Barents Sea . In the summer, it weakens and splits into two centres, one near Davis Strait , Labrador , and the other west of Iceland. It is a principal centre of action in the atmosphere circulation of the Northern Hemisphere, associated with frequent cyclone activity. It forms one pole of the North Atlantic oscillation , the other being the Azores High .
