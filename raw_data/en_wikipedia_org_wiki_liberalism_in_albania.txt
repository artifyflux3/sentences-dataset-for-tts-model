History [ edit ] A form of radical liberalism was dominant shortly after independence, but became oppressed. After the restoration of democracy in the 1990s, liberalism was and is only a weak political factor. Two parties could be considered to embrace liberal values: the Democratic Alliance Party ( Partia Aleanca Demokratike , member LI , ELDR ) and the Unity for Human Rights Party ( Partia Bashkimi për të Drejtat e Njeriut ), which is the party of the ethnic minorities.

Democratic Party [ edit ] 1924: The democratic faction of the Popular Party (Partia Popullore), led by Stylian Fan Noli seceded and established the liberal Democratic Party ( Parti Demokratike ).
