Further work in 1988 at GSI measured EC and SF branchings in 254 No. In 1989, the FLNR used the reaction to measure SF decay characteristics for the two isomers of 254 No. The measurement of the 2n excitation function was reported in 2001 by Yuri Oganessian at the FLNR.

Patin et al. at the LBNL reported in 2002 the synthesis of 255–251 No in the 1-4n exit channels and measured further decay data for these isotopes.

The reaction has recently been used at Jyväskylän Yliopisto Fysiikan Laitos (JYFL) using the RITU set-up to study K-isomerism in 254 No. The scientists were able to measure two K-isomers with half-lives of 275 ms and 198 s, respectively. They were assigned to 8 − and 16 + K-isomeric levels.

The reaction was used in 2004–5 at the FLNR to study the spectroscopy of 255–253 No. The team were able to confirm an isomeric level in 253 No with a half-life of 43.5 s.

208 Pb( 44 Ca,xn) 252−x No (x=2) This reaction was studied in 2003 at the FLNR in a study of the spectroscopy of 250 No.

207 Pb( 48 Ca,xn) 255−x No (x=2) The measurement of the 2n excitation function for this reaction was reported in 2001 by Yuri Oganessian and co-workers at the FLNR. The reaction was used in 2004–5 to study the spectroscopy of 253 No.

206 Pb( 48 Ca,xn) 254−x No (x=1,2,3,4) The measurement of the 1-4n excitation functions for this reaction were reported in 2001 by Yuri Oganessian and co-workers at the FLNR.
The 2n channel was further studied by the GSI to provide a spectroscopic determination of K-isomerism in 252 No. A K-isomer with spin and parity 8 − was detected with a half-life of 110 ms.

204 Pb( 48 Ca,xn) 252−x No (x=2,3) The measurement of the 2n excitation function for this reaction was reported in 2001 by Yuri Oganessian at the FLNR. They reported a new isotope 250 No with a half-life of 36 μs. The reaction was used in 2003 to study the spectroscopy of 250 No.They were able to observe two spontaneous fission activities with half-lives of 5.6 μs and 54 μs and assigned to 250 No and 249 No, respectively.
The latter activity was later assigned to a K-isomer in 250 No.

[ 11 ] The reaction was reported in 2006 by Peterson et al. at the Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) in a study of SF in 250 No. They detected two activities with half-lives of 3.7  μs and 43  μs and both assigned to 250 No, the latter associated with a K-isomer.

[ 12 ] In 2020, a team at FLNR repeated this reaction and found a new 9.1-MeV alpha particle activity correlated to 245 Fm and 241 Cf, which they assigned to the new isotope 249 No.

[ 13 ] Hot fusion [ edit ] 232 Th( 26 Mg,xn) 258−x No (x=4,5,6) The cross sections for the 4-6n exit channels have been measured for this reaction at the FLNR.

238 U( 22 Ne,xn) 260−x No (x=4,5,6) This reaction was first studied in 1964 at FLNR. The team were able to detect decays from 252 Fm and 250 Fm. The 252 Fm activity was associated with an ~8 s half-life and assigned to 256 102 from the 4n channel, with a yield of 45 nb.  
They were also able to detect a 10 s spontaneous fission activity also tentatively assigned to 256 102.
Further work in 1966 on the reaction examined the detection of 250 Fm decay using chemical separation and a parent activity with a half-life of ~50 s was reported and correctly assigned to 254 102. They also detected a 10 s spontaneous fission activity tentatively assigned to 256 102.
The reaction was used in 1969 to study some initial chemistry of nobelium at the FLNR. They determined eka-ytterbium properties, consistent with nobelium as the heavier homologue. In 1970, they were able to study the SF properties of 256 No.
In 2002, Patin et al. reported the synthesis of 256 No from the 4n channel but were unable to detect 257 No.

The cross section values for the 4-6n channels have also been studied at the FLNR.

238 U( 20 Ne,xn) 258−x No This reaction was studied in 1964 at FLNR. No spontaneous fission activities were observed.

236 U( 22 Ne,xn) 258−x No (x=4,5,6) The cross sections for the 4-6n exit channels have been measured for this reaction at the FLNR.

235 U( 22 Ne,xn) 257−x No (x=5) This reaction was studied in 1970 at the FLNR. It was used to study the SF decay properties of 252 No.

233 U( 22 Ne,xn) 255−x No The synthesis of neutron deficient nobelium isotopes was studied in 1975 at the FLNR. In their experiments they observed a 250 s SF activity, which they tentatively assigned to 250 No in the 5n exit channel. Later results have not been able to confirm this activity and it is currently unidentified.

242 Pu( 18 O,xn) 260−x No (x=4?) This reaction was studied in 1966 at the FLNR. The team identified an 8.2 s SF activity tentatively assigned to 256 102.

241 Pu( 16 O,xn) 257−x No This reaction was first studied in 1958 at the FLNR. The team measured ~8.8 MeV alpha particles with a half-life of 30 s and assigned to 253,252,251 102. A repeat in 1960 produced 8.9 MeV alpha particles with a half-life of 2–40 s and assigned to 253 102 from the 4n channel. Confidence in these results was later diminished.

239 Pu( 18 O,xn) 257−x No (x=5) This reaction was studied in 1970 at the FLNR in an effort to study the SF decay properties of 252 No.

239 Pu( 16 O,xn) 255−x No This reaction was first studied in 1958 at the FLNR. The team were able to measure ~8.8 MeV alpha particles with a half-life of 30 s and assigned to 253,252,251 102. A repeat in 1960 was unsuccessful and it was concluded the first results were probably associated with background effects.

243 Am( 15 N,xn) 258−x No (x=4) This reaction was studied in 1966 at the FLNR. The team were able to detect 250 Fm using chemical techniques and determined an associated half-life significantly higher than the reported 3 s by Berkeley for the supposed parent 254 No. Further work later the same year measured 8.1 MeV alpha particles with a half-life of 30–40 s.

243 Am( 14 N,xn) 257−x No This reaction was studied in 1966 at the FLNR. They were unable to detect the 8.1 MeV alpha particles detected when using a N-15 beam.

241 Am( 15 N,xn) 256−x No (x=4) The decay properties of 252 No were examined in 1977 at Oak Ridge. The team calculated a half-life of 2.3 s and measured a 27% SF branching.

248 Cm( 18 O,αxn) 262−x No (x=3) The synthesis of the new isotope 259 No was reported in 1973 from the LBNL using this reaction.

248 Cm( 13 C,xn) 261−x No (x=3?,4,5) This reaction was first studied in 1967 at the LBNL. The new isotopes 258 No, 257 No and 256 No were detected in the 3-5n channels. The reaction was repeated in 1970 to provide further decay data for 257 No.

248 Cm( 12 C,xn) 260−x No (4,5?) This reaction was studied in 1967 at the LBNL in their seminal study of nobelium isotopes. The reaction was used in 1990 at the LBNL to study the SF of 256 No.

246 Cm( 13 C,xn) 259−x No (4?,5?) This reaction was studied in 1967 at the LBNL in their seminal study of nobelium isotopes.

246 Cm( 12 C,xn) 258−x No (4,5) This reaction was studied in 1958 by scientists at the LBNL using a 5% 246 Cm curium target. They were able to measure 7.43 MeV decays from 250 Fm, associated with a 3 s 254 No parent activity, resulting from the 4n channel. The 3 s activity was later reassigned to 252 No, resulting from reaction with the predominant 244 Cm component in the target. It could however not be proved that it was not due to the contaminant 250m Fm, unknown at the time.
Later work in 1959 produced 8.3 MeV alpha particles with a half-life of 3 s and a 30% SF branch. This was initially assigned to 254 No and later reassigned to 252 No, resulting from reaction with the 244 Cm component in the target.
The reaction was restudied in 1967 and activities assigned to 254 No and 253 No were detected.

244 Cm( 13 C,xn) 257−x No (x=4) This reaction was first studied in 1957 at the Nobel Institute in Stockholm. The scientists detected 8.5 MeV alpha particles with a half-life of 10 minutes. The activity was assigned to 251 No or 253 No. The results were later dismissed as background.
The reaction was repeated by scientists at the LBNL in 1958 but they were unable to confirm the 8.5 MeV alpha particles. 
The reaction was further studied in 1967 at the LBNL and an activity assigned to 253 No was measured.

244 Cm( 12 C,xn) 256−x No (x=4,5) This reaction was studied in 1958 by scientists at the LBNL using a 95% 244 Cm curium target. They were able to measure 7.43 MeV decays from 250 Fm, associated with a 3 s 254 No parent activity, resulting from the reaction ( 246 Cm,4n). The 3 s activity was later reassigned to 252 No, resulting from reaction ( 244 Cm,4n). It could however not be proved that it was not due to the contaminant 250m Fm, unknown at the time.
Later work in 1959 produced 8.3 MeV alpha particles with a half-life of 3 s and a 30% SF branch. This was initially assigned to 254 No and later reassigned to 252 No, resulting from reaction with the 244 Cm component in the target.
The reaction was restudied in 1967 at the LBNL and a new activity assigned to 251 No was measured.

252 Cf( 12 C,αxn) 260−x No (x=3?) This reaction was studied at the LBNL in 1961 as part of their search for element 104 . They detected 8.2 MeV alpha particles with a half-life of 15 s. This activity was assigned to a Z=102 isotope. Later work suggests an assignment to 257 No, resulting most likely from the α3n channel with the 252 Cf component of the californium target.

252 Cf( 11 B,pxn) 262−x No (x=5?) This reaction was studied at the LBNL in 1961 as part of their search for element 103 . They detected 8.2 MeV alpha particles with a half-life of 15 s. This activity was assigned to a Z=102 isotope. Later work suggests an assignment to 257 No, resulting most likely from the p5n channel with the 252 Cf component of the californium target.

249 Cf( 12 C,αxn) 257−x No (x=2) This reaction was first studied in 1970 at the LBNL in a study of 255 No. It was studied in 1971 at the Oak Ridge Laboratory. They were able to measure coincident Z=100 K X-rays from 255 No, confirming the discovery of the element.

As decay products [ edit ] Isotopes of nobelium have also been identified in the decay of heavier elements. Observations to date are summarised in the table below: Evaporation Residue Observed No isotope 262 Lr 262 No 269 Hs, 265 Sg, 261 Rf 257 No 267 Hs, 263 Sg, 259 Rf 255 No 254 Lr 254 No 261 Sg, 257 Rf 253 No 264 Hs, 260 Sg, 256 Rf 252 No 255 Rf 251 No Isotopes [ edit ] Twelve radioisotopes of nobelium have been characterized, with the most stable being 259 No with a half-life of 58 minutes. Longer half-lives are expected for the as-yet-unknown 261 No and 263 No. An isomeric level has been found in 253 No and K-isomers have been found in 250 No, 252 No and 254 No to date.

They were able to confirm a previously reported K-isomer and detected a second K-isomer. They assigned spins and parities of 8 − and 16 + to the two K-isomers.

253 No In 1971, Bemis et al. was able to determine an isomeric level decaying with a half-life of 31 s from the decay of 257 Rf. This was confirmed in 2003 at the GSI by also studying the decay of 257 Rf. Further support in the same year from the FLNR appeared with a slightly higher half-life of 43.5 s, decaying by M2 gamma emission to the ground state.

252 No In a recent study by the GSI into K-isomerism in even-even isotopes, a K-isomer with a half-life of 110 ms was detected for 252 No. A spin and parity of 8 − was assigned to the isomer.

250 No In 2003, scientists at the FLNR reported that they had been able to synthesise 249 No, which decayed by SF with a half-life of 54 μs. Further work in 2006 by scientists at the ANL showed that the activity was actually due to a K-isomer in 250 No. The ground state isomer was also detected with a very short half-life of 3.7 μs.

However, subsequent work showed that the 54 μs fission activity instead originated from an excited state of 250 No.

[ 12 ] The discovery of this isotope was later reported in 2020; its decay properties differed from the 2003 claims.
