[ 22 ] History [ edit ] The Martin Maloney Cottage was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 26, 1992.

Spring Lake was formed as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 14, 1892, from portions of Wall Township , based on the results of a referendum held on March 8, 1892. On February 24, 1903, the borough of North Spring Lake was annexed to Spring Lake.

[ 23 ] [ 24 ] The borough was named for a clear spring-fed lake.

[ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ] During the " Gilded Age " of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Spring Lake developed into a coastal resort for members of New York City and Philadelphia high society, in similar fashion to the settlements of Newport, Rhode Island , and Bar Harbor, Maine .

[ 32 ] The wave of attacks took place between July 1 and July 12, 1916, along 80 miles (130 km) of Atlantic Ocean coastline and is often attributed as having inspired the novel Jaws by Peter Benchley and the corresponding film by Steven Spielberg , [ 33 ] though Benchley has explicitly denied the claim.
