[ 45 ] [ 46 ] 1990s:  Demonstrating that acute coronary events arise from small plaques, explaining their unpredictability, [ 47 ] and developing diagnostic MRI imaging to characterize these “vulnerable  plaques” [ 48 ] [ 49 ] and inhibiting post coronary angioplasty (PCI) fibrosis in pigs by Rapamycin , [ 49 ] [ 50 ] prompting the introduction of drug-eluting stents (DES) to prevent PCI restenosis .

[ 51 ] 2000s:  Following upon experience with CABG and DES for revascularization in patients with diabetes and multivessel coronary disease changing American and European practice guidelines.

[ 52 ] 2010s:  To improve poor medication adherence, as observed in FREEDOM and other studies, a fixed-dose polypill (aspirin, ramipril and statin ) was developed, the first approved for secondary prevention in 40 countries.

[ 53 ] 2015  to present (2021):  Established the predictive value of identifying atherosclerotic burden by noninvasive imaging (3D ultrasound, EBCT, PET, MRI) and genetics in 4 studies of 11,000 asymptomatic adults.

[ 54 ] [ 55 ] [ 56 ] [ 57 ] Thus, in collaboration with the producers of Sesame Street television, conducted randomized studies of 3,000 children, 2,000 parents and 300 teachers in Colombia , Spain and Harlem (New York). Sixty hours of health education over six months showed a significant impact on knowledge, attitude, habits and weight within three years.
