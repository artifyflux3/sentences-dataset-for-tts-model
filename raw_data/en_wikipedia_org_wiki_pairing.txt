Not to be confused with one-to-one correspondence .

In mathematics , a pairing is an R - bilinear map from the Cartesian product of two R - modules , where the underlying ring R is commutative .

Definition [ edit ] Let R be a commutative ring with unit , and let M , N and L be R -modules .

A pairing is any R -bilinear map e : M × × N → → L {\displaystyle e:M\times N\to L} . That is, it satisfies e ( r ⋅ ⋅ m , n ) = e ( m , r ⋅ ⋅ n ) = r ⋅ ⋅ e ( m , n ) {\displaystyle e(r\cdot m,n)=e(m,r\cdot n)=r\cdot e(m,n)} , e ( m 1 + m 2 , n ) = e ( m 1 , n ) + e ( m 2 , n ) {\displaystyle e(m_{1}+m_{2},n)=e(m_{1},n)+e(m_{2},n)} and e ( m , n 1 + n 2 ) = e ( m , n 1 ) + e ( m , n 2 ) {\displaystyle e(m,n_{1}+n_{2})=e(m,n_{1})+e(m,n_{2})} for any r ∈ ∈ R {\displaystyle r\in R} and any m , m 1 , m 2 ∈ ∈ M {\displaystyle m,m_{1},m_{2}\in M} and any n , n 1 , n 2 ∈ ∈ N {\displaystyle n,n_{1},n_{2}\in N} . Equivalently, a pairing is an R -linear map M ⊗ ⊗ R N → → L {\displaystyle M\otimes _{R}N\to L} where M ⊗ ⊗ R N {\displaystyle M\otimes _{R}N} denotes the tensor product of M and N .

A pairing can also be considered as an R -linear map Φ Φ : M → → Hom R ⁡ ⁡ ( N , L ) {\displaystyle \Phi :M\to \operatorname {Hom} _{R}(N,L)} , which matches the first definition by setting Φ Φ ( m ) ( n ) := e ( m , n ) {\displaystyle \Phi (m)(n):=e(m,n)} .

A pairing is called perfect if the above map Φ Φ {\displaystyle \Phi } is an isomorphism of R -modules and the other evaluation map Φ Φ ′ : : N → → Hom R ⁡ ⁡ ( M , L ) {\displaystyle \Phi '\colon N\to \operatorname {Hom} _{R}(M,L)} is an isomorphism also. In nice cases, it suffices that just one of these be an isomorphism, e.g. when R is a field, M,N are finite dimensional vector spaces and L=R .

A pairing is called non-degenerate on the right if for the above map we have that e ( m , n ) = 0 {\displaystyle e(m,n)=0} for all m {\displaystyle m} implies n = 0 {\displaystyle n=0} ; similarly, e {\displaystyle e} is called non-degenerate on the left if e ( m , n ) = 0 {\displaystyle e(m,n)=0} for all n {\displaystyle n} implies m = 0 {\displaystyle m=0} .

A pairing is called alternating if N = M {\displaystyle N=M} and e ( m , m ) = 0 {\displaystyle e(m,m)=0} for all m . In particular, this implies e ( m + n , m + n ) = 0 {\displaystyle e(m+n,m+n)=0} , while bilinearity shows e ( m + n , m + n ) = e ( m , m ) + e ( m , n ) + e ( n , m ) + e ( n , n ) = e ( m , n ) + e ( n , m ) {\displaystyle e(m+n,m+n)=e(m,m)+e(m,n)+e(n,m)+e(n,n)=e(m,n)+e(n,m)} . Thus, for an alternating pairing, e ( m , n ) = − − e ( n , m ) {\displaystyle e(m,n)=-e(n,m)} .

Examples [ edit ] Any scalar product on a real vector space V is a pairing (set M = N = V , R = R in the above definitions).

The determinant map (2 × 2 matrices over k ) → k can be seen as a pairing k 2 × × k 2 → → k {\displaystyle k^{2}\times k^{2}\to k} .

The Hopf map S 3 → → S 2 {\displaystyle S^{3}\to S^{2}} written as h : S 2 × × S 2 → → S 2 {\displaystyle h:S^{2}\times S^{2}\to S^{2}} is an example of a pairing. For instance, Hardie et al.

[ 1 ] present an explicit construction of the map using poset models.

Pairings in cryptography [ edit ] Main article: Pairing-based cryptography In cryptography , often the following specialized definition is used: [ 2 ] Let G 1 , G 2 {\displaystyle \textstyle G_{1},G_{2}} be additive groups and G T {\displaystyle \textstyle G_{T}} a multiplicative group , all of prime order p {\displaystyle \textstyle p} . Let P ∈ ∈ G 1 , Q ∈ ∈ G 2 {\displaystyle \textstyle P\in G_{1},Q\in G_{2}} be generators of G 1 {\displaystyle \textstyle G_{1}} and G 2 {\displaystyle \textstyle G_{2}} respectively.

A pairing is a map: e : G 1 × × G 2 → → G T {\displaystyle e:G_{1}\times G_{2}\rightarrow G_{T}} for which the following holds: Bilinearity : ∀ ∀ a , b ∈ ∈ Z : e ( a P , b Q ) = e ( P , Q ) a b {\displaystyle \textstyle \forall a,b\in \mathbb {Z} :\ e\left(aP,bQ\right)=e\left(P,Q\right)^{ab}} Non-degeneracy : e ( P , Q ) ≠ ≠ 1 {\displaystyle \textstyle e\left(P,Q\right)\neq 1} For practical purposes, e {\displaystyle \textstyle e} has to be computable in an efficient manner Note that it is also common in cryptographic literature for all groups to be written in multiplicative notation.

In cases when G 1 = G 2 = G {\displaystyle \textstyle G_{1}=G_{2}=G} , the pairing is called symmetric. As G {\displaystyle \textstyle G} is cyclic , the map e {\displaystyle e} will be commutative ; that is, for any P , Q ∈ ∈ G {\displaystyle P,Q\in G} , we have e ( P , Q ) = e ( Q , P ) {\displaystyle e(P,Q)=e(Q,P)} . This is because for a generator g ∈ ∈ G {\displaystyle g\in G} , there exist integers p {\displaystyle p} , q {\displaystyle q} such that P = g p {\displaystyle P=g^{p}} and Q = g q {\displaystyle Q=g^{q}} . Therefore e ( P , Q ) = e ( g p , g q ) = e ( g , g ) p q = e ( g q , g p ) = e ( Q , P ) {\displaystyle e(P,Q)=e(g^{p},g^{q})=e(g,g)^{pq}=e(g^{q},g^{p})=e(Q,P)} .

The Weil pairing is an important concept in elliptic curve cryptography ; e.g., it may be used to attack certain elliptic curves (see MOV attack ).  It and other pairings have been used to develop identity-based encryption schemes.

Slightly different usages of the notion of pairing [ edit ] Scalar products on complex vector spaces are sometimes called pairings, although they are not bilinear.
For example, in representation theory , one has a scalar product on the characters of complex representations of a finite group which is frequently called character pairing .
