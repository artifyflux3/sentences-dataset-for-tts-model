[ 1 ] It does not denote a single theory but encompasses many models, including for magnetism , superconductivity , superfluidity , [ 2 ] topological phase transition , wetting [ 3 ] [ 4 ] as well as non-equilibrium phase transitions.

[ 5 ] A SFT is any model in statistical mechanics where the degrees of freedom comprise a field or fields. In other words, the microstates of the system are expressed through field configurations. It is closely related to quantum field theory , which describes the quantum mechanics of fields, and shares with it many techniques, such as the path integral formulation and renormalization .
If the system involves polymers, it is also known as polymer field theory .

In fact, by performing a Wick rotation from Minkowski space to Euclidean space , many results of statistical field theory can be applied directly to its quantum equivalent.

[ citation needed ] The correlation functions of a statistical field theory are called Schwinger functions , and their properties are described by the Osterwalder–Schrader axioms .

Statistical field theories are widely used to describe systems in polymer physics or biophysics , such as polymer films, nanostructured block copolymers [ 6 ] or polyelectrolytes .
