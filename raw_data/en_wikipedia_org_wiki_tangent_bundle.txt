[ note 1 ] A tangent bundle is the collection of all of the tangent spaces for all points on a manifold , structured in a way that it forms a new manifold itself. Formally, in differential geometry , the tangent bundle of a differentiable manifold M {\displaystyle M} is a manifold T M {\displaystyle TM} which assembles all the tangent vectors in M {\displaystyle M} . As a set, it is given by the disjoint union [ note 1 ] of the tangent spaces of M {\displaystyle M} .  That is, T M = ⨆ ⨆ x ∈ ∈ M T x M = ⋃ ⋃ x ∈ ∈ M { x } × × T x M = ⋃ ⋃ x ∈ ∈ M { ( x , y ) ∣ ∣ y ∈ ∈ T x M } = { ( x , y ) ∣ ∣ x ∈ ∈ M , y ∈ ∈ T x M } {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}TM&=\bigsqcup _{x\in M}T_{x}M\\&=\bigcup _{x\in M}\left\{x\right\}\times T_{x}M\\&=\bigcup _{x\in M}\left\{(x,y)\mid y\in T_{x}M\right\}\\&=\left\{(x,y)\mid x\in M,\,y\in T_{x}M\right\}\end{aligned}}} where T x M {\displaystyle T_{x}M} denotes the tangent space to M {\displaystyle M} at the point x {\displaystyle x} .  So, an element of T M {\displaystyle TM} can be thought of as a pair ( x , v ) {\displaystyle (x,v)} , where x {\displaystyle x} is a point in M {\displaystyle M} and v {\displaystyle v} is a tangent vector to M {\displaystyle M} at x {\displaystyle x} .

There is a natural projection π π : T M ↠ ↠ M {\displaystyle \pi :TM\twoheadrightarrow M} defined by π π ( x , v ) = x {\displaystyle \pi (x,v)=x} .  This projection maps each element of the tangent space T x M {\displaystyle T_{x}M} to the single point x {\displaystyle x} .

The tangent bundle comes equipped with a natural topology (described in a section below ). With this topology, the tangent bundle to a manifold is the prototypical example of a vector bundle (which is a fiber bundle whose fibers are vector spaces ).  A section of T M {\displaystyle TM} is a vector field on M {\displaystyle M} , and the dual bundle to T M {\displaystyle TM} is the cotangent bundle , which is the disjoint union of the cotangent spaces of M {\displaystyle M} .  By definition, a manifold M {\displaystyle M} is parallelizable if and only if the tangent bundle is trivial . By definition, a manifold M {\displaystyle M} is framed if and only if the tangent bundle T M {\displaystyle TM} is stably trivial, meaning that for some trivial bundle E {\displaystyle E} the Whitney sum T M ⊕ ⊕ E {\displaystyle TM\oplus E} is trivial.  For example, the n -dimensional sphere S n is framed for all n , but parallelizable only for n = 1, 3, 7 (by results of Bott-Milnor and Kervaire).

Role [ edit ] One of the main roles of the tangent bundle is to provide a domain and range for the derivative of a smooth function.  Namely, if f : M → → N {\displaystyle f:M\rightarrow N} is a smooth function, with M {\displaystyle M} and N {\displaystyle N} smooth manifolds, its derivative is a smooth function D f : T M → → T N {\displaystyle Df:TM\rightarrow TN} .

Topology and smooth structure [ edit ] The tangent bundle comes equipped with a natural topology ( not the disjoint union topology ) and smooth structure so as to make it into a manifold in its own right. The dimension of T M {\displaystyle TM} is twice the dimension of M {\displaystyle M} .

Each tangent space of an n -dimensional manifold is an n -dimensional vector space. If U {\displaystyle U} is an open contractible subset of M {\displaystyle M} , then there is a diffeomorphism T U → → U × × R n {\displaystyle TU\to U\times \mathbb {R} ^{n}} which restricts to a linear isomorphism from each tangent space T x U {\displaystyle T_{x}U} to { x } × × R n {\displaystyle \{x\}\times \mathbb {R} ^{n}} . As a manifold, however, T M {\displaystyle TM} is not always diffeomorphic to the product manifold M × × R n {\displaystyle M\times \mathbb {R} ^{n}} . When it is of the form M × × R n {\displaystyle M\times \mathbb {R} ^{n}} , then the tangent bundle is said to be trivial . Trivial tangent bundles usually occur for manifolds equipped with a 'compatible group structure'; for instance, in the case where the manifold is a Lie group . The tangent bundle of the unit circle is trivial because it is a Lie group (under multiplication and its natural differential structure). It is not true however that all spaces with trivial tangent bundles are Lie groups; manifolds which have a trivial tangent bundle are called parallelizable . Just as manifolds are locally modeled on Euclidean space , tangent bundles are locally modeled on U × × R n {\displaystyle U\times \mathbb {R} ^{n}} , where U {\displaystyle U} is an open subset of Euclidean space.

If M is a smooth n -dimensional manifold, then it comes equipped with an atlas of charts ( U α α , ϕ ϕ α α ) {\displaystyle (U_{\alpha },\phi _{\alpha })} , where U α α {\displaystyle U_{\alpha }} is an open set in M {\displaystyle M} and ϕ ϕ α α : U α α → → R n {\displaystyle \phi _{\alpha }:U_{\alpha }\to \mathbb {R} ^{n}} is a diffeomorphism . These local coordinates on U α α {\displaystyle U_{\alpha }} give rise to an isomorphism T x M → → R n {\displaystyle T_{x}M\rightarrow \mathbb {R} ^{n}} for all x ∈ ∈ U α α {\displaystyle x\in U_{\alpha }} . We may then define a map ϕ ϕ ~ ~ α α : π π − − 1 ( U α α ) → → R 2 n {\displaystyle {\widetilde {\phi }}_{\alpha }:\pi ^{-1}\left(U_{\alpha }\right)\to \mathbb {R} ^{2n}} by ϕ ϕ ~ ~ α α ( x , v i ∂ ∂ i ) = ( ϕ ϕ α α ( x ) , v 1 , ⋯ ⋯ , v n ) {\displaystyle {\widetilde {\phi }}_{\alpha }\left(x,v^{i}\partial _{i}\right)=\left(\phi _{\alpha }(x),v^{1},\cdots ,v^{n}\right)} We use these maps to define the topology and smooth structure on T M {\displaystyle TM} . A subset A {\displaystyle A} of T M {\displaystyle TM} is open if and only if ϕ ϕ ~ ~ α α ( A ∩ ∩ π π − − 1 ( U α α ) ) {\displaystyle {\widetilde {\phi }}_{\alpha }\left(A\cap \pi ^{-1}\left(U_{\alpha }\right)\right)} is open in R 2 n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{2n}} for each α α .

{\displaystyle \alpha .} These maps are homeomorphisms between open subsets of T M {\displaystyle TM} and R 2 n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{2n}} and therefore serve as charts for the smooth structure on T M {\displaystyle TM} . The transition functions on chart overlaps π π − − 1 ( U α α ∩ ∩ U β β ) {\displaystyle \pi ^{-1}\left(U_{\alpha }\cap U_{\beta }\right)} are induced by the Jacobian matrices of the associated coordinate transformation and are therefore smooth maps between open subsets of R 2 n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{2n}} .

The tangent bundle is an example of a more general construction called a vector bundle (which is itself a specific kind of fiber bundle ). Explicitly, the tangent bundle to an n {\displaystyle n} -dimensional manifold M {\displaystyle M} may be defined as a rank n {\displaystyle n} vector bundle over M {\displaystyle M} whose transition functions are given by the Jacobian of the associated coordinate transformations.

Examples [ edit ] The simplest example is that of R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} . In this case the tangent bundle is trivial: each T x R n {\displaystyle T_{x}\mathbf {\mathbb {R} } ^{n}} is canonically isomorphic to T 0 R n {\displaystyle T_{0}\mathbb {R} ^{n}} via the map R n → → R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}\to \mathbb {R} ^{n}} which subtracts x {\displaystyle x} , giving a diffeomorphism T R n → → R n × × R n {\displaystyle T\mathbb {R} ^{n}\to \mathbb {R} ^{n}\times \mathbb {R} ^{n}} .

Another simple example is the unit circle , S 1 {\displaystyle S^{1}} (see picture above). The tangent bundle of the circle is also trivial and isomorphic to S 1 × × R {\displaystyle S^{1}\times \mathbb {R} } . Geometrically, this is a cylinder of infinite height.

The only tangent bundles that can be readily visualized are those of the real line R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } and the unit circle S 1 {\displaystyle S^{1}} , both of which are trivial. For 2-dimensional manifolds the tangent bundle is 4-dimensional and hence difficult to visualize.

A simple example of a nontrivial tangent bundle is that of the unit sphere S 2 {\displaystyle S^{2}} : this tangent bundle is nontrivial as a consequence of the hairy ball theorem . Therefore, the sphere is not parallelizable .

Vector fields [ edit ] A smooth assignment of a tangent vector to each point of a manifold is called a vector field . Specifically, a vector field on a manifold M {\displaystyle M} is a smooth map V : : M → → T M {\displaystyle V\colon M\to TM} such that V ( x ) = ( x , V x ) {\displaystyle V(x)=(x,V_{x})} with V x ∈ ∈ T x M {\displaystyle V_{x}\in T_{x}M} for every x ∈ ∈ M {\displaystyle x\in M} . In the language of fiber bundles, such a map is called a section . A vector field on M {\displaystyle M} is therefore a section of the tangent bundle of M {\displaystyle M} .

The set of all vector fields on M {\displaystyle M} is denoted by Γ Γ ( T M ) {\displaystyle \Gamma (TM)} . Vector fields can be added together pointwise ( V + W ) x = V x + W x {\displaystyle (V+W)_{x}=V_{x}+W_{x}} and multiplied by smooth functions on M ( f V ) x = f ( x ) V x {\displaystyle (fV)_{x}=f(x)V_{x}} to get other vector fields. The set of all vector fields Γ Γ ( T M ) {\displaystyle \Gamma (TM)} then takes on the structure of a module over the commutative algebra of smooth functions on M , denoted C ∞ ∞ ( M ) {\displaystyle C^{\infty }(M)} .

A local vector field on M {\displaystyle M} is a local section of the tangent bundle. That is, a local vector field is defined only on some open set U ⊂ ⊂ M {\displaystyle U\subset M} and assigns to each point of U {\displaystyle U} a vector in the associated tangent space. The set of local vector fields on M {\displaystyle M} forms a structure known as a sheaf of real vector spaces on M {\displaystyle M} .

The above construction applies equally well to the cotangent bundle – the differential 1-forms on M {\displaystyle M} are precisely the sections of the cotangent bundle ω ω ∈ ∈ Γ Γ ( T ∗ ∗ M ) {\displaystyle \omega \in \Gamma (T^{*}M)} , ω ω : M → → T ∗ ∗ M {\displaystyle \omega :M\to T^{*}M} that associate to each point x ∈ ∈ M {\displaystyle x\in M} a 1-covector ω ω x ∈ ∈ T x ∗ ∗ M {\displaystyle \omega _{x}\in T_{x}^{*}M} , which map tangent vectors to real numbers: ω ω x : T x M → → R {\displaystyle \omega _{x}:T_{x}M\to \mathbb {R} } . Equivalently, a differential 1-form ω ω ∈ ∈ Γ Γ ( T ∗ ∗ M ) {\displaystyle \omega \in \Gamma (T^{*}M)} maps a smooth vector field X ∈ ∈ Γ Γ ( T M ) {\displaystyle X\in \Gamma (TM)} to a smooth function ω ω ( X ) ∈ ∈ C ∞ ∞ ( M ) {\displaystyle \omega (X)\in C^{\infty }(M)} .

Higher-order tangent bundles [ edit ] Since the tangent bundle T M {\displaystyle TM} is itself a smooth manifold, the second-order tangent bundle can be defined via repeated application of the tangent bundle construction: T 2 M = T ( T M ) .

{\displaystyle T^{2}M=T(TM).\,} In general, the k {\displaystyle k} th order tangent bundle T k M {\displaystyle T^{k}M} can be defined recursively as T ( T k − − 1 M ) {\displaystyle T\left(T^{k-1}M\right)} .

A smooth map f : M → → N {\displaystyle f:M\rightarrow N} has an induced derivative, for which the tangent bundle is the appropriate domain and range D f : T M → → T N {\displaystyle Df:TM\rightarrow TN} .  Similarly, higher-order tangent bundles provide the domain and range for higher-order derivatives D k f : T k M → → T k N {\displaystyle D^{k}f:T^{k}M\to T^{k}N} .

A distinct but related construction are the jet bundles on a manifold, which are bundles consisting of jets .

Canonical vector field on tangent bundle [ edit ] On every tangent bundle T M {\displaystyle TM} , considered as a manifold itself, one can define a canonical vector field V : T M → → T 2 M {\displaystyle V:TM\rightarrow T^{2}M} as the diagonal map on the tangent space at each point. This is possible because the tangent space of a vector space W is naturally a product, T W ≅ ≅ W × × W , {\displaystyle TW\cong W\times W,} since the vector space itself is flat, and thus has a natural diagonal map W → → T W {\displaystyle W\to TW} given by w ↦ ↦ ( w , w ) {\displaystyle w\mapsto (w,w)} under this product structure. Applying this product structure to the tangent space at each point and globalizing yields the canonical vector field. Informally, although the manifold M {\displaystyle M} is curved, each tangent space at a point x {\displaystyle x} , T x M ≈ ≈ R n {\displaystyle T_{x}M\approx \mathbb {R} ^{n}} , is flat, so the tangent bundle manifold T M {\displaystyle TM} is locally a product of a curved M {\displaystyle M} and a flat R n .

{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}.} Thus the tangent bundle of the tangent bundle is locally (using ≈ ≈ {\displaystyle \approx } for "choice of coordinates" and ≅ ≅ {\displaystyle \cong } for "natural identification"): T ( T M ) ≈ ≈ T ( M × × R n ) ≅ ≅ T M × × T ( R n ) ≅ ≅ T M × × ( R n × × R n ) {\displaystyle T(TM)\approx T(M\times \mathbb {R} ^{n})\cong TM\times T(\mathbb {R} ^{n})\cong TM\times (\mathbb {R} ^{n}\times \mathbb {R} ^{n})} and the map T T M → → T M {\displaystyle TTM\to TM} is the projection onto the first coordinates: ( T M → → M ) × × ( R n × × R n → → R n ) .

{\displaystyle (TM\to M)\times (\mathbb {R} ^{n}\times \mathbb {R} ^{n}\to \mathbb {R} ^{n}).} Splitting the first map via the zero section and the second map by the diagonal yields the canonical vector field.

If ( x , v ) {\displaystyle (x,v)} are local coordinates for T M {\displaystyle TM} , the vector field has the expression V = ∑ ∑ i v i ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ v i | ( x , v ) .

{\displaystyle V=\sum _{i}\left.v^{i}{\frac {\partial }{\partial v^{i}}}\right|_{(x,v)}.} More concisely, ( x , v ) ↦ ↦ ( x , v , 0 , v ) {\displaystyle (x,v)\mapsto (x,v,0,v)} – the first pair of coordinates do not change because it is the section of a bundle and these are just the point in the base space: the last pair of coordinates are the section itself. This expression for the vector field depends only on v {\displaystyle v} , not on x {\displaystyle x} , as only the tangent directions can be naturally identified.

Alternatively, consider the scalar multiplication function: { R × × T M → → T M ( t , v ) ⟼ ⟼ t v {\displaystyle {\begin{cases}\mathbb {R} \times TM\to TM\\(t,v)\longmapsto tv\end{cases}}} The derivative of this function with respect to the variable R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } at time t = 1 {\displaystyle t=1} is a function V : T M → → T 2 M {\displaystyle V:TM\rightarrow T^{2}M} , which is an alternative description of the canonical vector field.

The existence of such a vector field on T M {\displaystyle TM} is analogous to the canonical one-form on the cotangent bundle . Sometimes V {\displaystyle V} is also called the Liouville vector field , or radial vector field . Using V {\displaystyle V} one can characterize the tangent bundle. Essentially, V {\displaystyle V} can be characterized using 4 axioms, and if a manifold has a vector field satisfying these axioms, then the manifold is a tangent bundle and the vector field is the canonical vector field on it. See for example, De León et al.

Lifts [ edit ] There are various ways to lift objects on M {\displaystyle M} into objects on T M {\displaystyle TM} . For example,  if γ γ {\displaystyle \gamma } is a curve in M {\displaystyle M} , then γ γ ′ {\displaystyle \gamma '} (the tangent of γ γ {\displaystyle \gamma } )  is a curve in T M {\displaystyle TM} . In contrast, without further assumptions on M {\displaystyle M} (say, a Riemannian metric ), there is no similar lift into the cotangent bundle .

The vertical lift of a function f : M → → R {\displaystyle f:M\rightarrow \mathbb {R} } is the function f ∨ ∨ : T M → → R {\displaystyle f^{\vee }:TM\rightarrow \mathbb {R} } defined by f ∨ ∨ = f ∘ ∘ π π {\displaystyle f^{\vee }=f\circ \pi } , where π π : T M → → M {\displaystyle \pi :TM\rightarrow M} is the canonical projection.

This is graphically illustrated in the accompanying picture for tangent bundle of circle S 1 , see Examples section: all tangents to a circle lie in the plane of the circle. In order to make them disjoint it is necessary to align them in a plane perpendicular to the plane of the circle.
