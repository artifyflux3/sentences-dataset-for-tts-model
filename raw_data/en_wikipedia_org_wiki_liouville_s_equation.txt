Liouville's equation , named after Joseph Liouville , [ 1 ] is a nonlinear partial differential equation that arises in differential geometry when studying surfaces of constant curvature . It plays a central role in the theory of conformal geometry , where one seeks to understand how a curved surface can be represented in flat (Euclidean) coordinates while preserving angles.

Suppose a surface is described in local coordinates ( x , y ) {\displaystyle (x,y)} , and we wish to assign it a Riemannian metric that has constant Gaussian curvature K {\displaystyle K} . A particularly useful form of such a metric is f ( x , y ) 2 ( d x 2 + d y 2 ) {\displaystyle f(x,y)^{2}(dx^{2}+dy^{2})} , where the function f ( x , y ) {\displaystyle f(x,y)} determines the local scaling of lengths. The equation satisfied by this conformal factor f {\displaystyle f} is called Liouville's equation: Δ Δ 0 log ⁡ ⁡ f = − − K f 2 , {\displaystyle \Delta _{0}\log f=-Kf^{2},} where Δ Δ 0 = ∂ ∂ 2 ∂ ∂ x 2 + ∂ ∂ 2 ∂ ∂ y 2 {\displaystyle \Delta _{0}={\frac {\partial ^{2}}{\partial x^{2}}}+{\frac {\partial ^{2}}{\partial y^{2}}}} is the flat Laplace operator in two dimensions.

This equation governs how to deform flat space to give it constant curvature. For example, when K > 0 {\displaystyle K>0} , it describes spherical geometry ; when K < 0 {\displaystyle K<0} , hyperbolic geometry . The function f ( x , y ) {\displaystyle f(x,y)} tells how much the flat metric must be stretched or shrunk at each point to reflect this curvature .

Liouville's equation is closely tied to the use of isothermal coordinates , in which the metric takes a conformally flat form. It also appears in complex analysis , as the conformal factor can be expressed using Wirtinger derivatives : Δ Δ 0 = 4 ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ z ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ z ¯ ¯ .

{\displaystyle \Delta _{0}=4{\frac {\partial }{\partial z}}{\frac {\partial }{\partial {\bar {z}}}}.} A logarithmic change of variable, u = log ⁡ ⁡ f {\displaystyle u=\log f} , gives a more commonly used form of the equation: Δ Δ 0 u = − − K e 2 u .

{\displaystyle \Delta _{0}u=-Ke^{2u}.} Liouville's equation also features in mathematical physics (e.g., in models of 2D gravity ) and was cited by David Hilbert in his formulation of the nineteenth problem , concerning the smoothness of solutions to certain elliptic PDEs .

Other common forms of Liouville's equation [ edit ] By using the change of variables log f ↦ u , another commonly found form of Liouville's equation is obtained: Δ Δ 0 u = − − K e 2 u .

{\displaystyle \Delta _{0}u=-Ke^{2u}.} Other two forms of the equation, commonly found in the literature, [ 2 ] are obtained by using the slight variant 2 log f ↦ u of the previous change of variables and Wirtinger calculus : [ 3 ] Δ Δ 0 u = − − 2 K e u ⟺ ⟺ ∂ ∂ 2 u ∂ ∂ z ∂ ∂ z ¯ ¯ = − − K 2 e u .

{\displaystyle \Delta _{0}u=-2Ke^{u}\quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad {\frac {\partial ^{2}u}{{\partial z}{\partial {\bar {z}}}}}=-{\frac {K}{2}}e^{u}.} Note that it is exactly in the first one of the preceding two forms that Liouville's equation was cited by David Hilbert in the formulation of his nineteenth problem .

[ 4 ] [ a ] A formulation using the Laplace–Beltrami operator [ edit ] In a more invariant fashion, the equation can be written in terms of the intrinsic Laplace–Beltrami operator Δ Δ L B = 1 f 2 Δ Δ 0 {\displaystyle \Delta _{\mathrm {LB} }={\frac {1}{f^{2}}}\Delta _{0}} as follows: Δ Δ L B log f = − − K .

{\displaystyle \Delta _{\mathrm {LB} }\log \;f=-K.} Properties [ edit ] Relation to Gauss–Codazzi equations [ edit ] Liouville's equation is equivalent to the Gauss–Codazzi equations for minimal immersions into the 3-space, when the metric is written in isothermal coordinates z {\displaystyle z} such that the Hopf differential is d z 2 {\displaystyle \mathrm {d} z^{2}} .

General solution of the equation [ edit ] In a simply connected domain Ω , the general solution of Liouville's equation can be found by using Wirtinger calculus.

[ 5 ] Its form is given by u ( z , z ¯ ¯ ) = ln ⁡ ⁡ ( 4 | d f ( z ) / d z | 2 ( 1 + K | f ( z ) | 2 ) 2 ) {\displaystyle u(z,{\bar {z}})=\ln \left(4{\frac {\left|{\mathrm {d} f(z)}/{\mathrm {d} z}\right|^{2}}{(1+K\left|f(z)\right|^{2})^{2}}}\right)} where f ( z ) is any meromorphic function such that ⁠ d f / d z ⁠ ( z ) ≠ 0 for every z ∈ Ω .

[ 5 ] f ( z ) has at most simple poles in Ω .

[ 5 ] Application [ edit ] Liouville's equation can be used to prove the following classification results for surfaces: Theorem .

[ 6 ] A surface in the Euclidean 3-space with metric d l 2 = g ( z , _ z )d z d _ z , and with constant scalar curvature K is locally isometric to: the sphere if K > 0 ; the Euclidean plane if K = 0 ; the Lobachevskian plane if K < 0 .

Notes [ edit ] ^ Hilbert assumes K = -1/2 , therefore the equation appears as the following semilinear elliptic equation ∂ ∂ 2 f ∂ ∂ x 2 + ∂ ∂ 2 f ∂ ∂ y 2 = e f {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial ^{2}f}{\partial x^{2}}}+{\frac {\partial ^{2}f}{\partial y^{2}}}=e^{f}} Citations [ edit ] ^ Liouville, Joseph (1838).
