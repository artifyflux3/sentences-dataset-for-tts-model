Contributions [ edit ] Byers received a B.A. from the University of California, Berkeley in 1950 and a Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in 1956.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] Byers made phenomenological analyses of experimental observations leading to theoretical advances in particle physics and the theory of superconductivity . In "Theoretical considerations concerning quantized magnetic flux in superconductors," she showed that observation of flux quantization in superconductors in units of hc/2e is experimental evidence for the Cooper pairing of electrons proposed by the BCS theory of superconductivity ( Byers-Yang theorem ).

[ 3 ] In addition to scientific papers, Byers published papers and edited a book on original and important contributions to modern physics by 20th century female physicists. She developed the website Contributions of 20th Century Women to Physics (CWP website), which documents original and important contributions to physics by over 80 female physicists of the 20th century.

[ 4 ] With Gary Williams, [ 5 ] she edited a book based on data from the website that expands the biographies and describes more fully the scientific contributions of forty distinguished 20th century female physicists.

[ 6 ] Byers was elected to many offices in The American Physical Society (APS) and American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), including President of the APS Forum on History of Physics (2004–2005), APS Forum on Physics and Society (1982), and APS Councilor-at-large of the Society (1977–81).
