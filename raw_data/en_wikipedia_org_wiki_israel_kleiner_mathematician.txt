Kleiner earned an MA at Yale University (1963) and a PhD at McGill University (1967) under Joachim Lambek with a thesis Lie modules and rings of quotients .

[ 1 ] Before his retirement as professor emeritus, he spent his career as a mathematics professor at York University , where he was a member of the faculty since 1965 and where he coordinated the training program for mathematics teachers teaching at the secondary school level. He is noted for his work on the history of algebra and on the combination of the history of mathematics and mathematics education.

He received the Carl B. Allendoerfer Award in 1987 and again in 1992, the George Pólya Award in 1990, and the Lester Randolph Ford Award in 1995. He was in the mid 2000s vice-president of the Canadian Society for the History and Philosophy of Mathematics.
