The term means one who feels pain caused by others' undeserved success. It is part of a trio of terms, with epikhairekakia (ἐπιχαιρεκακία ) meaning one who takes pleasure in others' pain, similar to Schadenfreude , and phthonos (φθόνος) meaning one who feels pain caused by any pleasure, deserved or not, similar to envy .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] It is the opposite of pity, as pity is pain at undeserved mis fortune.
