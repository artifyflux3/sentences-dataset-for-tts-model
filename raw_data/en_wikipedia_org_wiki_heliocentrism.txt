**Heliocentrism**[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-1) (also known as the **heliocentric model**) is a [superseded astronomical model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_superseded_scientific_theories#Astronomy_and_cosmology "List of superseded scientific theories") in which [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth") and [planets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System "Solar System") orbit around the [Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun "Sun") at the center of the [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe "Universe"). Historically, heliocentrism was opposed to [geocentrism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentric_model "Geocentric model"), which placed Earth at the center. The notion that Earth revolves around the Sun had been proposed as early as the 3rd century BC by [Aristarchus of Samos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristarchus_of_Samos "Aristarchus of Samos"),[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-2) who had been influenced by a concept presented by [Philolaus of Croton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philolaus_of_Croton "Philolaus of Croton") (c. 470 – 385 BC). In the 5th century BC the [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece "Greece")[philosophers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy "Philosophy")[Philolaus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philolaus "Philolaus") and [Hicetas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hicetas "Hicetas") had the thought on different occasions that Earth was spherical and revolving around a "mystical" [central fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_astronomical_system#Central_Fire "Pythagorean astronomical system"), and that this fire regulated the universe.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-3) In medieval [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe "Europe"), however, Aristarchus' heliocentrism attracted little attention—possibly because of the loss of scientific works of the [Hellenistic period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenistic_period "Hellenistic period").[[b]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-5)

It was not until the 16th century that a [mathematical model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model "Mathematical model") of a heliocentric system was [presented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copernican_heliocentrism "Copernican heliocentrism") by the [Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance "Renaissance") mathematician, astronomer, and [Catholic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church "Catholic Church") cleric, [Nicolaus Copernicus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Copernicus "Nicolaus Copernicus"), leading to the [Copernican Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copernican_Revolution "Copernican Revolution"). In 1576, [Thomas Digges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Digges "Thomas Digges") published a modified Copernican system. His modifications are close to modern observations. In the following century, [Johannes Kepler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Kepler "Johannes Kepler") introduced [elliptical orbits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_orbit "Elliptic orbit"), and [Galileo Galilei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei "Galileo Galilei") presented supporting observations made using a [telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telescope "Telescope").

With the observations of [William Herschel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Herschel "William Herschel"), [Friedrich Bessel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Bessel "Friedrich Bessel"), and other astronomers, it was realized that the Sun, while near the [barycenter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barycenter "Barycenter") of the [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System "Solar System"), was not central in the universe. Modern astronomy does not distinguish any center.

Ancient and medieval astronomy
------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Heliocentrism&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Ancient and medieval astronomy")]

While the [sphericity of Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_Earth "Spherical Earth") was widely recognized in [Greco-Roman astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_astronomy "Ancient Greek astronomy") from at least the 4th century BC,[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-6) Earth's [daily rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_rotation "Earth's rotation") and [yearly orbit around the Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_orbit "Earth's orbit") was never universally accepted until the [Copernican Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copernican_Revolution "Copernican Revolution").

While a moving Earth was proposed at least from the 4th century BC in [Pythagoreanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoreanism "Pythagoreanism"), and a fully developed heliocentric model was developed by [Aristarchus of Samos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristarchus_of_Samos "Aristarchus of Samos") in the 3rd century BC, these ideas were not successful in replacing the view of a stationary spherical Earth, and from the 2nd century AD the predominant model, which would be inherited by medieval astronomy, was the [geocentric model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemaic_system "Ptolemaic system") described in [Ptolemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy "Ptolemy")'s _[Almagest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almagest "Almagest")_.

The movements of the Moon, the planets, and the Sun around the static Earth in the Ptolemaic geocentric model (upper panel) in comparison to the orbits of the planets and the daily-rotating Earth around the Sun in the Copernican heliocentric model (lower panel). In both models, the Moon rotates around Earth.

Problems with Ptolemy's system were well recognized in [medieval astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_astronomy#Middle_Ages "History of astronomy"), and an increasing effort to criticize and improve it in the late medieval period eventually led to the [Copernican heliocentrism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copernican_heliocentrism "Copernican heliocentrism") developed in [Renaissance astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_astronomy#Renaissance_and_Early_Modern_Europe "History of astronomy").

### Classical antiquity

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Heliocentrism&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Classical antiquity")]

The first non-geocentric model of the [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe "Universe") was proposed by the [Pythagorean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoreans "Pythagoreans") philosopher [Philolaus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philolaus "Philolaus") (d. 390 BC), who taught that at the center of the universe was a "central fire", around which [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth"), the [Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun "Sun"), the [Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon "Moon"), and [planets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet "Planet") revolved in [uniform circular motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_circular_motion "Uniform circular motion"). This system postulated the existence of a [Counter-Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Earth "Counter-Earth")[collinear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collinearity "Collinearity") with Earth and central fire, with the same period of revolution around the central fire as Earth. The Sun revolved around the central fire once a year, and the stars were stationary. Earth maintained the same hidden face towards the central fire, rendering both it and the "Counter-Earth" invisible from Earth. The Pythagorean concept of uniform circular motion remained unchallenged for approximately the next 2000 years, and it was to the Pythagoreans that Copernicus referred to show that the notion of a moving Earth was neither new nor revolutionary.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-7) Kepler gave an alternative explanation of the Pythagoreans' "central fire" as the Sun, "_as most sects purposely hid[e] their teachings_".[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-8)

[Heraclides of Pontus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraclides_Ponticus "Heraclides Ponticus") (4th century BC) said that the [rotation of Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_rotation "Earth's rotation") explained the apparent daily motion of the celestial sphere. It used to be thought that he believed [Mercury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(planet) "Mercury (planet)") and [Venus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus "Venus") to revolve around the Sun, which in turn (along with the other planets) revolves around Earth.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-9)[Macrobius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrobius "Macrobius") (AD 395—423) later described this as the "Egyptian System," stating that "it did not escape the skill of the [Egyptians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptians "Egyptians")," though there is no other evidence it was known in [ancient Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt "Ancient Egypt").[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-10)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-11)

Aristotle wrote his chief cosmological treatise, _[On the Heavens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On\_the\_Heavens "On the Heavens")_, in 350 BC.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-De_caelo-12) It contains his astronomical theory which proposed a geocentric model of the universe. The Earth is the center of motion of the universe, with circular motion being perfect because Earth was at the center of it. Much of _On the Heavens_ is concerned with refuting the views of Aristotle's predecessors. For example, Aristotle sets his eyes multiple times on the analyses of weight given by the Pythagoreans and [Plato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato "Plato") in the _[Timaeus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timaeus\_(dialogue) "Timaeus (dialogue)")_.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-13)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-14)

#### Aristarchus of Samos

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Heliocentrism&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Aristarchus of Samos")]

[![Image 3](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/Aristarchus_working.jpg/250px-Aristarchus_working.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Aristarchus_working.jpg)

[Aristarchus'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristarchus_of_Samos "Aristarchus of Samos") 3rd century BC calculations on the relative sizes of Earth, the Sun, and the Moon, from a 10th-century AD Greek copy

The first person known to have proposed a heliocentric system was [Aristarchus of Samos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristarchus_of_Samos "Aristarchus of Samos")(c. 270 BC). Like his contemporary [Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes "Eratosthenes"), Aristarchus calculated the size of Earth and measured the [sizes and distances of the Sun and Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Sizes_and_Distances_(Aristarchus) "On the Sizes and Distances (Aristarchus)"). From his estimates, he concluded that the Sun was six to seven times wider than Earth, and thought that the larger object would have the most attractive force.

His writings on the heliocentric system are lost, but some information about them is known from a brief description by his contemporary, [Archimedes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes "Archimedes"), and from scattered references by later writers. Archimedes' description of Aristarchus' theory is given in the former's book, _[The Sand Reckoner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Sand\_Reckoner "The Sand Reckoner")_. The entire description comprises just three sentences, which [Thomas Heath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Little_Heath "Thomas Little Heath") translates as follows:[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-HeathSand-15)

> _You [ [King Gelon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelo,\_son\_of\_Hiero\_II "Gelo, son of Hiero II") ] are aware that "universe" is the name given by most astronomers to the sphere, the centre of which is the centre of the earth, while its radius is equal to the straight line between the centre of the sun and the centre of the earth. This is the common account (τά γραφόμενα), as you have heard from astronomers. But Aristarchus brought out_ a book consisting of certain hypotheses _, wherein it appears, as a consequence of the assumptions made, that the universe is many times greater than the "universe" just mentioned. His hypotheses are that_ the fixed stars and the sun remain unmoved, that the earth revolves about the sun on the circumference of a circle, the sun lying in the middle of the orbit _, and that the sphere of the fixed stars, situated about the same centre as the sun, is so great that the circle in which he supposes the earth to revolve bears such a proportion to the distance of the fixed stars as the centre of the sphere bears to its surface._

— _The Sand Reckoner_ (_Arenarius_ I, 4–7)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-HeathSand-15)

[Aristarchus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristarchus_of_Samos "Aristarchus of Samos") presumably took the stars to be very far away because he was aware that their [parallax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax#Stellar_parallax "Parallax")[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-16) would otherwise be observed over the course of a year. The stars are in fact so far away that stellar parallax only became detectable when sufficiently powerful [telescopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telescope "Telescope") had been developed in the [1830s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1838_in_science#Astronomy "1838 in science").

No references to Aristarchus' heliocentrism are known in any other writings from before the [common era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_era "Common era"). The earliest of the handful of other ancient references occur in two passages from the writings of [Plutarch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutarch "Plutarch"). These mention one detail not stated explicitly in Archimedes' account[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-17)—namely, that Aristarchus' theory had Earth rotating on an axis. The first of these reference occurs in _Concerning the Face Which Appears in the Orb of the Moon_:[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-18)

> _Only do not, my good fellow, enter an action against me for impiety in the style of [Cleanthes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleanthes "Cleanthes"), who thought it was the duty of Greeks to indict Aristarchus of Samos on the charge of impiety for putting in motion the Hearth of the Universe, this being the effect of his attempt to save the phenomena by supposing the heaven to remain at rest and the earth to revolve in an oblique circle, while it rotates, at the same time, about its own axis._

— _Concerning the Face Which Appears in the Orb of the Moon_ (_De facie in orbe lunae_, c. 6, pp. 922 F – 923 A.)

Only scattered fragments of [Cleanthes'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleanthes "Cleanthes") writings have survived in quotations by other writers, but in _[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lives\_and\_Opinions\_of\_Eminent\_Philosophers "Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers")_, [Diogenes Laërtius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diogenes_La%C3%ABrtius "Diogenes Laërtius") lists _A reply to Aristarchus_ (Πρὸς Ἀρίσταρχον) as one of Cleanthes' works,[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-19) and some scholars[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-FOOTNOTEEdwards1998p._[httpsbooksgooglecombooksidnS51_7qbEWsCpgPA68_68]_and_n._104,_p._[httpsbooksgooglecombooksidnS51_7qbEWsCpgPA455_455]-20) have suggested that this might have been where Cleanthes had accused Aristarchus of [impiety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impiety "Impiety").

The second of the references by Plutarch is in his _Platonic Questions_:[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHeath1913[httpsarchiveorgstreamaristarchusofsam00heatuoftpage305_305]-21)

> _Did Plato put the earth in motion, as he did the sun, the moon, and the five planets, which he called the instruments of time on account of their turnings, and was it necessary to conceive that the earth "which is globed about the axis stretched from pole to pole through the whole universe" was not represented as being held together and at rest, but as turning and revolving (στρεφομένην καὶ ἀνειλουμένην), as Aristarchus and [Seleucus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seleucus\_of\_Seleucia "Seleucus of Seleucia") afterwards maintained that it did, the former stating this as only a hypothesis (ὑποτιθέμενος μόνον), the latter as a definite opinion (καὶ ἀποφαινόμενος)?_

— _Platonic Questions_ (_Platonicae Quaestiones_ viii. I, 1006 C)

The remaining references to Aristarchus' heliocentrism are extremely brief, and provide no more information beyond what can be gleaned from those already cited. Ones which mention Aristarchus explicitly by name occur in [Aëtius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aetius_(philosopher) "Aetius (philosopher)")' _Opinions of the Philosophers_, [Sextus Empiricus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sextus_Empiricus "Sextus Empiricus")' _Against the Mathematicians_,[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHeath1913[httpsarchiveorgstreamaristarchusofsam00heatuoftpage305_305]-21) and an anonymous scholiast to Aristotle.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDreyer1953[httpsarchiveorgstreamhistoryofplaneta00dreyuoftpage139mode1up_139]-22) Another passage in Aëtius' _Opinions of the Philosophers_ reports that Seleucus the astronomer had affirmed Earth's motion, but does not mention Aristarchus.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHeath1913[httpsarchiveorgstreamaristarchusofsam00heatuoftpage305_305]-21)

#### Seleucus of Seleucia

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Heliocentrism&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Seleucus of Seleucia")]

Since [Plutarch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutarch "Plutarch") mentions the "followers of Aristarchus" in passing, it is likely that there were other astronomers in the [Classical period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Greece "Classical Greece") who also espoused heliocentrism, but whose work was lost.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-23) The only other astronomer from antiquity known by name who is known to have supported Aristarchus' heliocentric model was Seleucus of Seleucia (b. 190 BC), a [Hellenistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenistic_civilization "Hellenistic civilization") astronomer who flourished a century after Aristarchus in the [Seleucid Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seleucid_Empire "Seleucid Empire").[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-24) Seleucus was a proponent of the heliocentric system of Aristarchus.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-25) Seleucus may have proved the heliocentric theory by determining the constants of a [geometric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry") model for the heliocentric theory and developing methods to compute planetary positions using this model. He may have used early [trigonometric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometry "Trigonometry") methods that were available in his time, as he was a contemporary of [Hipparchus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hipparchus "Hipparchus").[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-26) A fragment of a work by Seleucus has survived in Arabic translation, which was referred to by [Rhazes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Bakr_al-Razi "Abu Bakr al-Razi") (b. 865).[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-27)

Alternatively, his explanation may have involved the phenomenon of [tides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tide "Tide"),[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-28) which he supposedly theorized to be caused by the attraction to the Moon and by the revolution of Earth around Earth and the Moon's [center of mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barycenter "Barycenter").

In the [Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible "Bible"), First Chronicles 16:30 states that "Indeed, the world is firmly established, it will not be moved." [[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-nasb-29) Psalm 104:5 says, "[God] set the earth on its foundations, so that it should never be moved."[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-esv-30) Ecclesiastes 1:5 states that "The sun rises, and the sun goes down, and hastens to the place where it rises."[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-esv-30)

Joshua 10:12-13 says:

> Then Joshua spoke to the LORD on the day when the LORD turned the Amorites over to the sons of Israel, and he said in the sight of Israel,
> 
> 
> 'Sun, stand still at Gibeon, and moon, at the Valley of Aijalon!'
> 
>  So the sun stood still, and the moon stopped, until the nation avenged themselves of their enemies. ...
> 
> 
> And the sun stopped in the middle of the sky and did not hurry to go down for about a whole day."[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-nasb-29)

Ptolemy wrote the _Almagest_ possibly around 150 AD; it is a mathematical and astronomical treatise on the apparent motions of the stars and planetary paths. The Ptolemaic system was a sophisticated astronomical system that managed to calculate the positions for the planets to a fair degree of accuracy.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-31) Ptolemy himself, in his _Almagest_, says that any model for describing the motions of the planets is merely a [mathematical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics") device, and since there is no actual way to know which is true, the simplest model that gets the right numbers should be used.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-32) However, he rejected the idea of a [spinning Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_rotation "Earth rotation") as absurd as he believed it would create huge winds. Within his [model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#Astronomy "Ptolemy") the distances of the [Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon "Moon"), the [Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun "Sun"), [planets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet "Planet"), and [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star "Star") could be determined by treating orbits' [celestial spheres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_spheres#Antiquity "Celestial spheres") as contiguous realities, which gave the stars' distance as less than 20 [Astronomical Units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_Units "Astronomical Units"),[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-33) a regression, since [Aristarchus of Samos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristarchus_of_Samos "Aristarchus of Samos")'s heliocentric scheme had centuries earlier [necessarily](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#Classical_antiquity) placed the stars at least two orders of magnitude more distant.

There were occasional speculations about heliocentrism in Europe before Copernicus. In [Roman Carthage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carthage#Roman_Carthage "Carthage"), the [pagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pagan "Pagan")[Martianus Capella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martianus_Capella "Martianus Capella") (5th century AD) expressed the opinion that the planets Venus and Mercury did not go about Earth but instead circled the Sun.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-:0-34) Capella's model was discussed in the [Early Middle Ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Middle_Ages "Early Middle Ages") by various anonymous 9th-century commentators[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-:1-35) and Copernicus mentions him as an influence on his own work.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-:2-36) Also [Macrobius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrobius "Macrobius") (420 CE) described a heliocentric model.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-:13-37)

[Aryabhata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata "Aryabhata") (476–550), in his [magnum opus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnum_opus "Magnum opus")_[Aryabhatiya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhatiya "Aryabhatiya")_ (499), propounded a planetary model in which Earth was taken to be [spinning on its axis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_rotation "Earth's rotation") and the periods of the planets were given with respect to the Sun.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-FOOTNOTEThurston1993188-38)[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-:13-37) His immediate commentators, such as [Lalla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lalla "Lalla"), and other later authors, rejected his innovative view about the turning Earth.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-39) It has been argued that Aryabhatta's calculations were based on an underlying heliocentric model, in which the planets orbit the Sun,[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-40)[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-41) although this has also been rebutted.[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-42) The general consensus is that a synodic anomaly (depending on the position of the Sun) does not imply a physically heliocentric orbit (such corrections being also present in late Babylonian astronomical texts), and that Aryabhata's system was not explicitly heliocentric.[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-43) He also made many astronomical calculations, such as the times of the [solar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse "Solar eclipse") and [lunar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_eclipse "Lunar eclipse")[eclipses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse "Eclipse"), and the instantaneous motion of the Moon.[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-FOOTNOTEJoseph2000393%E2%80%93394,_408-44) Early followers of Aryabhata's model included [Varahamihira](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varahamihira "Varahamihira"), [Brahmagupta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmagupta "Brahmagupta"), and [Bhaskara II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhaskara_II "Bhaskara II").

For a time, [Muslim astronomers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy_in_the_medieval_Islamic_world#Notable_astronomers "Astronomy in the medieval Islamic world") accepted the [Ptolemaic system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemaic_model "Ptolemaic model") and the geocentric model, which were used by [al-Battani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Battani "Al-Battani") to show that the distance between the Sun and Earth varies.[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-FOOTNOTESabra1998317f-45)[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-46) In the 10th century, [al-Sijzi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Sijzi "Al-Sijzi") accepted that [Earth rotates around its axis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_rotation "Earth's rotation").[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-47)[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-young-48) According to later astronomer [al-Biruni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Biruni "Al-Biruni"), al-Sijzi invented an [astrolabe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrolabe "Astrolabe") called _al-zūraqī_ based on a belief held by some of his contemporaries that the apparent motion of the stars was due to Earth's movement, and not that of the [firmament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmament "Firmament").[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-young-48)[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-49) Islamic astronomers began to criticize the Ptolemaic model, including [Ibn al-Haytham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_al-Haytham "Ibn al-Haytham") in his _Al-Shukūk 'alā Baṭalamiyūs_ ("Doubts Concerning Ptolemy", c. 1028),[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-50)[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-FOOTNOTEQadir19895%E2%80%9310.-51) who found contradictions in Ptolemy's model, but al-Haytham remained committed to a geocentric model.[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-52)

[![Image 4](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Lunar_phases_al-Biruni.jpg/250px-Lunar_phases_al-Biruni.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Lunar_phases_al-Biruni.jpg)

An illustration from [al-Biruni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Biruni "Al-Biruni")'s astronomical works explains the different [phases of the Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_phase "Lunar phase") with respect to the position of the Sun.

Al-Biruni discussed the possibility of whether Earth rotated about its own axis and orbited the Sun, but in his _Masudic Canon_ (1031),[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-Covington_2007-53) he expressed his faith in a geocentric and stationary Earth.[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-54) He was aware that if Earth rotated on its axis, it would be consistent with his astronomical observations,[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-55) but considered it a problem of [natural philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_philosophy "Natural philosophy") rather than one of mathematics.[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-young-48)[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-FOOTNOTESaliba1999-56)

In the 12th century, non-heliocentric alternatives to the Ptolemaic system were developed by some Islamic astronomers, such as [Nur ad-Din al-Bitruji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nur_ad-Din_al-Bitruji "Nur ad-Din al-Bitruji"), who considered the Ptolemaic model mathematical, and not physical.[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-57)[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-DSB-58) His system spread throughout most of Europe in the 13th century, with debates and refutations of his ideas continued to the 16th century.[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-DSB-58)

The [Maragha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maragheh_observatory "Maragheh observatory") school of astronomy in [Ilkhanid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilkhanid "Ilkhanid")-era Persia further developed "non-Ptolemaic" planetary models involving [Earth's rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_rotation "Earth's rotation"). Notable astronomers of this school are [Al-Urdi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Urdi "Al-Urdi") (d. 1266) [Al-Katibi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Najm_al-D%C4%ABn_al-Qazw%C4%ABn%C4%AB_al-K%C4%81tib%C4%AB "Najm al-Dīn al-Qazwīnī al-Kātibī") (d. 1277),[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-59) and [Al-Tusi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasir_al-Din_al-Tusi "Nasir al-Din al-Tusi") (d. 1274).

The arguments and evidence used resemble those used by Copernicus to support Earth's motion.[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-Ragep-60)[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-Ragep2-61) The criticism of Ptolemy as developed by [Averroes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Averroes "Averroes") and by the Maragha school explicitly address [Earth's rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_rotation "Earth's rotation") but it did not arrive at explicit heliocentrism.[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-Huff_1993-62) The observations of the Maragha school were further improved at the Timurid-era [Samarkand Observatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulugh_Beg_Observatory "Ulugh Beg Observatory") under [Qushji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Qushji "Ali Qushji") (1403–1474).

In [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India "India"), [Nilakantha Somayaji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nilakantha_Somayaji "Nilakantha Somayaji") (1444–1544), in his _Aryabhatiyabhasya_, a commentary on Aryabhata's _Aryabhatiya_, developed a computational system for a geo-heliocentric planetary model, in which the planets orbit the Sun, which in turn orbits Earth, similar to the [system later proposed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tychonic_system "Tychonic system") by [Tycho Brahe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tycho_Brahe "Tycho Brahe"). In the _[Tantrasamgraha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tantrasamgraha "Tantrasamgraha")_ (1501), Somayaji further revised his planetary system, which was mathematically more accurate at predicting the heliocentric orbits of the interior planets than both the Tychonic and [Copernican models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copernican_heliocentrism "Copernican heliocentrism"),[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-FOOTNOTEJoseph2000-63)[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-64) but did not propose any specific models of the universe.[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-FOOTNOTERamasubramanianSrinivasSriram1994788-65) Nilakantha's planetary system also incorporated Earth's rotation on its axis.[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-66) Most astronomers of the [Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala_school_of_astronomy_and_mathematics "Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics") seem to have accepted his planetary model.[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-FOOTNOTEJoseph2000408-67)[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-68)

Renaissance-era astronomy
-------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Heliocentrism&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Renaissance-era astronomy")]

[![Image 5](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Nicholas_of_Cusa.jpg/250px-Nicholas_of_Cusa.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Nicholas_of_Cusa.jpg)

[Nicholas of Cusa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_of_Cusa "Nicholas of Cusa"), 15th century, asked whether there was any reason to assert that any point was the center of the universe.

[Martianus Capella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martianus_Capella "Martianus Capella") (5th century CE) expressed the opinion that the planets Venus and Mercury did not go about Earth but instead circled the Sun.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-:0-34) Capella's model was discussed in the [Early Middle Ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Middle_Ages "Early Middle Ages") by various anonymous 9th-century commentators[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-69) and Copernicus mentions him as an influence on his own work.[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-70)[Macrobius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrobius "Macrobius") (420 CE) described a heliocentric model.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-:13-37)[John Scotus Eriugena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Scotus_Eriugena "John Scotus Eriugena")(815-877 CE) proposed a model reminiscent of that from Tycho Brahe.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-:13-37)

In the 14th century, bishop [Nicole Oresme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicole_Oresme "Nicole Oresme") discussed the possibility that Earth rotated on its axis, while Cardinal [Nicholas of Cusa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_of_Cusa "Nicholas of Cusa") in his _[Learned Ignorance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De\_Docta\_Ignorantia "De Docta Ignorantia")_ asked whether there was any reason to assert that the Sun (or any other point) was the center of the universe. In parallel to a mystical definition of God, Cusa wrote that "Thus the fabric of the world (_machina mundi_) will _quasi_ have its center everywhere and circumference nowhere,"[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-71) recalling [Hermes Trismegistus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermes_Trismegistus "Hermes Trismegistus").[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-72)

Some historians maintain that the thought of the [Maragheh observatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maragheh_observatory "Maragheh observatory"), in particular the mathematical devices known as the [Urdi lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urdi_lemma "Urdi lemma") and the [Tusi couple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tusi_couple "Tusi couple"), influenced Renaissance-era European astronomy, and thus was indirectly received by Renaissance-era European astronomy and thus by [Copernicus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copernicus "Copernicus").[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-FOOTNOTESaliba1999-56)[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-73)[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-74)[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-FOOTNOTESabra1998-75)[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-76) Copernicus used such devices in the same planetary models as found in Arabic sources.[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-77) The exact replacement of the [equant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equant "Equant") by two [epicycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicycles "Epicycles") used by Copernicus in the _[Commentariolus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commentariolus "Commentariolus")_ was found in an earlier work by [Ibn al-Shatir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_al-Shatir "Ibn al-Shatir") (d. c. 1375) of Damascus.[[76]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-Swerdlow-78) Copernicus' lunar and Mercury models are also identical to Ibn al-Shatir's.[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-79)

While the influence of the criticism of Ptolemy by Averroes on Renaissance thought is clear and explicit, the claim of direct influence of the Maragha school, postulated by [Otto E. Neugebauer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_E._Neugebauer "Otto E. Neugebauer") in 1957, remains an open question.[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-Huff_1993-62)[[78]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-80)[[79]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-81)[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] Since the [Tusi couple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tusi_couple "Tusi couple") was used by Copernicus in his reformulation of mathematical astronomy, there is a growing consensus that he became aware of this idea in some way. One possible route of transmission may have been through [Byzantine science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_science "Byzantine science"), which translated some of [al-Tusi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nas%C4%ABr_al-D%C4%ABn_al-T%C5%ABs%C4%AB "Nasīr al-Dīn al-Tūsī")'s works from Arabic into [Byzantine Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_Greek "Medieval Greek"). Several Byzantine Greek manuscripts containing the Tusi couple are still extant in Italy.[[80]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-82) The Mathematics Genealogy Project suggests that there is a "genealogy" of Nasir al-Dīn al-Ṭūsī → Shams al‐Dīn al‐Bukhārī → [Gregory Chioniades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregory_Chioniades "Gregory Chioniades") → [Manuel Bryennios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Bryennios "Manuel Bryennios") → [Theodore Metochites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Metochites "Theodore Metochites") → [Gregory Palamas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregory_Palamas "Gregory Palamas") → [Nilos Kabasilas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nilos_Kabasilas "Nilos Kabasilas") → [Demetrios Kydones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demetrios_Kydones "Demetrios Kydones") → [Gemistos Plethon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemistos_Plethon "Gemistos Plethon") → [Basilios Bessarion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilios_Bessarion "Basilios Bessarion") → [Johannes Regiomontanus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Regiomontanus "Johannes Regiomontanus") → [Domenico Maria Novara da Ferrara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domenico_Maria_Novara_da_Ferrara "Domenico Maria Novara da Ferrara") → Nicolaus (Mikołaj Kopernik) Copernicus.[[81]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu-83)[Leonardo da Vinci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci "Leonardo da Vinci") (1452–1519) wrote "_Il sole non si move._" ("The Sun does not move.")[[82]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-84) and he was a student of a student of Bessarion according to the [Mathematics Genealogy Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics_Genealogy_Project "Mathematics Genealogy Project").[[81]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu-83) It has been suggested that the idea of the Tusi couple may have arrived in Europe leaving few manuscript traces, since it could have occurred without the translation of any Arabic text into Latin.[[83]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-85)[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-FOOTNOTESaliba1999-56)

Other scholars have argued that Copernicus could well have developed these ideas independently of the late Islamic tradition.[[84]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGoddu2010261%E2%80%9369,_476%E2%80%9386-86)[[85]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-Huff_2010_p._263-87)[[86]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-FOOTNOTEdi_Bono1995-88)[[87]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-FOOTNOTEVeselovsky1973-89) Copernicus explicitly references several astronomers of the "[Islamic Golden Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Golden_Age "Islamic Golden Age")" (10th to 12th centuries) in _De Revolutionibus_: [Albategnius (Al-Battani)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Battani "Al-Battani"), [Averroes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Averroes "Averroes") (Ibn Rushd), [Thebit (Thabit Ibn Qurra)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thabit_ibn_Qurra "Thabit ibn Qurra"), [Arzachel (Al-Zarqali)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Zarqali "Al-Zarqali"), and [Alpetragius (Al-Bitruji)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Bitruji "Al-Bitruji"), but he does not show awareness of the existence of any of the later astronomers of the Maragha school.[[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-freely-90)

It has been argued that Copernicus could have independently discovered the Tusi couple or took the idea from [Proclus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proclus "Proclus")'s _Commentary on the First Book of [Euclid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s\_Elements "Euclid's Elements")_,[[89]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-91) which Copernicus cited.[[90]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-92) Another possible source for Copernicus' knowledge of this mathematical device is the _Questiones de Spera_ of [Nicole Oresme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicole_Oresme "Nicole Oresme"), who described how a reciprocating linear motion of a celestial body could be produced by a combination of circular motions similar to those proposed by al-Tusi.[[91]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-93)

The state of knowledge on planetary theory received by Copernicus is summarized in [Georg von Peuerbach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_von_Peuerbach "Georg von Peuerbach")'s _Theoricae Novae Planetarum_ (printed in 1472 by [Regiomontanus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regiomontanus "Regiomontanus")). By 1470, the accuracy of observations by the Vienna school of astronomy, of which [Peuerbach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_von_Peuerbach "Georg von Peuerbach") and [Regiomontanus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regiomontanus "Regiomontanus") were members, was high enough to make the eventual development of heliocentrism inevitable, and indeed it is possible that Regiomontanus did arrive at an explicit theory of heliocentrism before his death in 1476, some 30 years before Copernicus.[[92]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKoestler1990[httpsarchiveorgdetailssleepwalkershist00koes_0page212_212]-94)

### Copernican heliocentrism

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Heliocentrism&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Copernican heliocentrism")]

Portrait of [Nicolaus Copernicus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Copernicus "Nicolaus Copernicus") (1578)[[c]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-95)

[Nicolaus Copernicus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Copernicus "Nicolaus Copernicus") in his _[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De\_revolutionibus\_orbium\_coelestium "De revolutionibus orbium coelestium")_ ("On the revolution of heavenly spheres", first printed in 1543 in [Nuremberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg "Nuremberg")), presented a discussion of a heliocentric model of the universe in much the same way as [Ptolemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy "Ptolemy") in the 2nd century had presented his geocentric model in his _[Almagest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almagest "Almagest")_. Copernicus discussed the philosophical implications of his proposed system, elaborated it in geometrical detail, used selected astronomical observations to derive the parameters of his model, and wrote astronomical tables which enabled one to compute the past and future positions of the stars and planets. In doing so, Copernicus moved heliocentrism from philosophical speculation to predictive geometrical astronomy. In reality, Copernicus' system did not predict the planets' positions any better than the Ptolemaic system.[[93]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-96) This theory resolved the issue of planetary [retrograde motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrograde_motion "Retrograde motion") by arguing that such motion was only perceived and apparent, rather than [real](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality "Reality"): it was a [parallax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax "Parallax") effect, as an object that one is passing seems to move backwards against the horizon. This issue was also resolved in the geocentric [Tychonic system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tychonic_system "Tychonic system"); the latter, however, while eliminating the major [epicycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicycle "Epicycle"), retained as a physical reality the irregular back-and-forth motion of the planets, which Kepler characterized as a "[pretzel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretzel "Pretzel")".[[94]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGingerich200451-97)

Copernicus cited Aristarchus in an early (unpublished) manuscript of _De Revolutionibus_ (which still survives), stating: "_Philolaus believed in the mobility of the earth, and some even say that Aristarchus of Samos was of that opinion._"[[95]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-98) However, in the published version he restricts himself to noting that in works by [Cicero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicero "Cicero") he had found an account of the theories of [Hicetas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hicetas "Hicetas") and that [Plutarch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutarch "Plutarch") had provided him with an account of the [Pythagoreans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoreans "Pythagoreans"), [Heraclides Ponticus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraclides_Ponticus "Heraclides Ponticus"), [Philolaus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philolaus "Philolaus"), and [Ecphantus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecphantus "Ecphantus"). These authors had proposed a moving Earth, which did not, however, revolve around a central Sun.

Reception in Early Modern Europe
--------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Heliocentrism&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Reception in Early Modern Europe")]

The first information about the heliocentric views of [Nicolaus Copernicus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Copernicus "Nicolaus Copernicus") was circulated in manuscript completed some time before May 1, 1514.[[96]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-99) In 1533, [Johann Albrecht Widmannstetter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Albrecht_Widmannstetter "Johann Albrecht Widmannstetter") delivered in Rome a series of lectures outlining Copernicus' theory. The lectures were heard with interest by [Pope Clement VII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Clement_VII "Pope Clement VII") and several Catholic [cardinals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_(Catholicism) "Cardinal (Catholicism)").[[97]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-FOOTNOTESpeller2008[httpsbooksgooglecombooksidjviElHq-kEcCpgPA51_51]-100)

In 1539, [Martin Luther](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther "Martin Luther") purportedly said:

> "_There is talk of a new astrologer who wants to prove that the earth moves and goes around instead of the sky, the sun, the moon, just as if somebody were moving in a carriage or ship might hold that he was sitting still and at rest while the earth and the trees walked and moved. But that is how things are nowadays: when a man wishes to be clever he must … invent something special, and the way he does it must needs be the best! The fool wants to turn the whole art of astronomy upside-down. However, as Holy Scripture tells us, so did Joshua bid the sun to stand still and not the earth._"[[98]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-101)

This was reported in the context of a conversation at the dinner table and not a formal statement of faith. [Melanchthon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanchthon "Melanchthon"), however, opposed the doctrine over a period of years.[[99]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-102)[[100]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-103)

### Publication of _De Revolutionibus_ (1543)

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Heliocentrism&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Publication of De Revolutionibus (1543)")]

[Nicolaus Copernicus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Copernicus "Nicolaus Copernicus") published the definitive statement of his system in [_De Revolutionibus_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Revolutionibus_Orbium_Coelestium "De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium") in 1543. Copernicus began to write it in 1506 and finished it in 1530, but did not publish it until the year of his death. Although he was in good standing with the Church and had dedicated the book to [Pope Paul III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Paul_III "Pope Paul III"), the published form contained an unsigned preface by [Osiander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Osiander "Andreas Osiander") defending the system and arguing that it was useful for computation even if its hypotheses were not necessarily true. Possibly because of that preface, the work of Copernicus inspired very little debate on whether it might be [heretical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heresy "Heresy") during the next 60 years. There was an early suggestion among [Dominicans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominican_Order "Dominican Order") that the teaching of heliocentrism should be banned, but nothing came of it at the time.

Some years after the publication of _De Revolutionibus_[John Calvin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Calvin "John Calvin") preached a sermon in which he denounced those who "pervert the order of nature" by saying that "the sun does not move and that it is the earth that revolves and that it turns".[[101]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-FOOTNOTERosen1995159-104)[[d]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-109)

### Tycho Brahe's geo-heliocentric system (c. 1587)

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Heliocentrism&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: Tycho Brahe's geo-heliocentric system (c. 1587)")]

[![Image 7](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Tychonian_system.svg/330px-Tychonian_system.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Tychonian_system.svg)

In this depiction of the Tychonic system, the objects on blue orbits (the Moon and the Sun) revolve around Earth. The objects on orange orbits (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn) revolve around the Sun. Around all is a sphere of fixed stars, located just beyond Saturn.

Prior to the publication of _De Revolutionibus_, the most widely accepted system had been proposed by [Ptolemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy "Ptolemy"), in which [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth") was the center of the universe and all celestial bodies orbited it. [Tycho Brahe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tycho_Brahe "Tycho Brahe"), arguably the most accomplished astronomer of his time, advocated against Copernicus' heliocentric system and for an alternative to the Ptolemaic geocentric system: a geo-heliocentric system now known as the [Tychonic system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tychonic_system "Tychonic system") in which the Sun and Moon orbit Earth, Mercury and Venus orbit the Sun inside the Sun's orbit of Earth, and Mars, Jupiter and Saturn orbit the Sun outside the Sun's orbit of Earth.

Tycho appreciated the Copernican system, but objected to the idea of a moving Earth on the basis of [astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy "Astronomy"), [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics"), and [religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion "Religion"). The [Aristotelian physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotelian_physics "Aristotelian physics") of the time (modern [Newtonian physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newtonian_physics "Newtonian physics") was still a century away) offered no physical explanation for the motion of a massive body like Earth, whereas it could easily explain the motion of heavenly bodies by postulating that they were made of a different sort substance called [aether](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aether_(classical_element) "Aether (classical element)") that moved naturally. So Tycho said that the Copernican system "_...expertly and completely circumvents all that is superfluous or discordant in the system of Ptolemy. On no point does it offend the principle of mathematics. Yet it ascribes to the Earth, that hulking, lazy body, unfit for motion, a motion as quick as that of the aethereal torches, and a triple motion at that._"[[106]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-110) Likewise, Tycho took issue with the vast distances to the stars that Aristarchus and Copernicus had assumed in order to explain the lack of any visible parallax. Tycho had measured the [apparent sizes of stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_magnitude "Apparent magnitude") (now known to be illusory), and used geometry to calculate that in order to both have those apparent sizes and be as far away as heliocentrism required, stars would have to be huge (much larger than the sun; the size of Earth's orbit or larger). Regarding this Tycho wrote, "_Deduce these things geometrically if you like, and you will see how many absurdities (not to mention others) accompany this assumption [of the motion of the earth] by inference._"[[107]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-111) He also cited the Copernican system's "_opposition to the authority of Sacred Scripture in more than one place_" as a reason why one might wish to reject it, and observed that his own geo-heliocentric alternative "_offended neither the principles of physics nor Holy Scripture_."[[108]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-112)

The [Jesuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesuits "Jesuits") astronomers in [Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome "Rome") were at first unreceptive to Tycho's system; the most prominent, [Clavius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Clavius "Christopher Clavius"), commented that Tycho was "_confusing all of astronomy, because he wants to have [Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars "Mars") lower than the Sun._"[[109]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFantoli2003109-113) However, after the advent of the telescope showed problems with some geocentric models (by demonstrating that Venus circles the Sun, for example), the Tychonic system and variations on that system became popular among geocentrists, and the Jesuit astronomer [Giovanni Battista Riccioli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Battista_Riccioli "Giovanni Battista Riccioli") would continue Tycho's use of physics, stellar astronomy (now with a telescope), and religion to argue against heliocentrism and for Tycho's system well into the seventeenth century.

During [Giordano Bruno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giordano_Bruno "Giordano Bruno")'s lifetime (1548–1600), he is the only known person to defend Copernicus' heliocentrism.[[110]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-FOOTNOTESmith1952[httpsarchiveorgdetailsmanhisgods00smitpage310_310%E2%80%93311]-114) In 1584, Bruno published two dialogues (_La Cena de le Ceneri_ and _De l'infinito universo et mondi_) in which he argued against the planetary spheres ([Christoph Rothmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christoph_Rothmann "Christoph Rothmann") did the same in 1586 as did [Tycho Brahe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tycho_Brahe "Tycho Brahe") in 1587) and affirmed the Copernican principle.

In particular, to support the Copernican view and oppose the objection according to which the motion of Earth would be perceived by means of the motion of winds, clouds etc., in _La Cena de le Ceneri_ Bruno anticipates some of the arguments of Galilei on the relativity principle.[[111]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-115) Note that he also uses the example now known as [Galileo's ship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo%27s_ship "Galileo's ship").[[112]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-116)

Using measurements made at Tycho's observatory, [Johannes Kepler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Kepler "Johannes Kepler") developed his [laws of planetary motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_laws_of_planetary_motion "Kepler's laws of planetary motion") between 1609 and 1619.[[113]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-117) In _[Astronomia nova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomia\_nova "Astronomia nova")_ (1609), Kepler made a diagram of the movement of Mars in relation to Earth if Earth were at the center of its orbit, which shows that Mars' orbit would be completely imperfect and never follow along the same path. To solve the apparent derivation of Mars' orbit from a perfect circle, Kepler derived both a mathematical definition and, independently, a matching ellipse around the Sun to explain the motion of the red planet.[[114]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKoestler1990[httpsarchiveorgdetailssleepwalkershist00koes_0page338_338]-118)

Between 1617 and 1621, Kepler developed a heliocentric model of the Solar System in _[Epitome astronomiae Copernicanae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epitome\_astronomiae\_Copernicanae "Epitome astronomiae Copernicanae")_, in which all the planets have elliptical orbits. This provided significantly increased accuracy in predicting the position of the planets. Kepler's ideas were not immediately accepted, and Galileo for example ignored them. In 1621, _Epitome astronomia Copernicanae_ was placed on the Catholic Church's index of prohibited books despite Kepler being a Protestant.

### Galileo Galilei and 1616 ban against Copernicanism

In the 17th century AD, [Galileo Galilei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei "Galileo Galilei") opposed the [Roman Catholic Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church "Roman Catholic Church") by his strong support for heliocentrism.

Galileo was able to look at the night sky with the newly invented telescope. He published his observations that [Jupiter is orbited by moons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galilean_moons "Galilean moons") and that the Sun rotates in his _[Sidereus Nuncius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidereus\_Nuncius "Sidereus Nuncius")_ (1610)[[115]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-FOOTNOTESmith1952-119) and _[Letters on Sunspots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letters\_on\_Sunspots "Letters on Sunspots")_ (1613), respectively. Around this time, he also announced that [Venus exhibits a full range of phases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phases_of_Venus "Phases of Venus") (satisfying an argument that had been made against Copernicus).[[115]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-FOOTNOTESmith1952-119) As the Jesuit astronomers confirmed Galileo's observations, the Jesuits moved away from the Ptolemaic model and toward Tycho's teachings.[[116]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKoestler1990[httpsarchiveorgdetailssleepwalkershist00koes_0page433_433]-120)

In his 1615 "[Letter to the Grand Duchess Christina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_to_the_Grand_Duchess_Christina "Letter to the Grand Duchess Christina")", Galileo defended heliocentrism, and claimed it was not contrary to [Holy Scripture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Scripture "Holy Scripture"). He took [Augustine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo "Augustine of Hippo")'s position on Scripture: not to take every passage literally when the scripture in question is in a Bible book of poetry and songs, not a book of instructions or history. The writers of the Scripture wrote from the perspective of the terrestrial world, and from that vantage point the Sun does rise and set. In fact, it is Earth's rotation which gives the impression of the Sun in motion across the sky. In February 1615, prominent Dominicans including Thomaso Caccini and [Niccolò Lorini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niccol%C3%B2_Lorini "Niccolò Lorini") brought Galileo's writings on heliocentrism to the attention of the Inquisition, because they appeared to violate Holy Scripture and the decrees of the [Council of Trent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Trent "Council of Trent").[[117]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-FOOTNOTELangford199856%E2%80%9357-121)[[118]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDrake1978240-122)[[119]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-FOOTNOTESharratt1994110%E2%80%93111-123)[[120]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFavaro1907[httpswebarchiveorgweb20151208071722httpmoroimssfiitletturaLetturaWEBDLLVOL19VOLPAG297_297%E2%80%93298]-124) Cardinal and Inquisitor [Robert Bellarmine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Bellarmine "Robert Bellarmine") was called upon to adjudicate, and wrote in April that treating heliocentrism as a real phenomenon would be "a very dangerous thing," irritating philosophers and [theologians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theologians "Theologians"), and harming "the Holy Faith by rendering Holy Scripture as false."[[121]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-FOOTNOTESharratt1994110%E2%80%93115-125)

In January 1616, Msgr. [Francesco Ingoli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francesco_Ingoli "Francesco Ingoli") addressed an essay to Galileo disputing the Copernican system. Galileo later stated that he believed this essay to have been instrumental in the ban against Copernicanism that followed in February.[[122]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-126) According to Maurice Finocchiaro, Ingoli had probably been commissioned by the Inquisition to write an expert opinion on the controversy, and the essay provided the "chief direct basis" for the ban.[[123]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFinocchiaro201072-127) The essay focused on eighteen physical and mathematical arguments against heliocentrism. It borrowed primarily from the arguments of Tycho Brahe, and it notedly mentioned the problem that heliocentrism requires the stars to be much larger than the Sun. Ingoli wrote that the great distance to the stars in the heliocentric theory "_clearly proves ... the fixed stars to be of such size, as they may surpass or equal the size of the orbit circle of the Earth itself._"[[124]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGraney201571-128) Ingoli included four theological arguments in the essay, but suggested to Galileo that he focus on the physical and mathematical arguments. Galileo did not write a response to Ingoli until 1624.[[125]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGraney201566%E2%80%9376,_164%E2%80%93175,_187%E2%80%93195-129)

In February 1616, the Inquisition assembled a committee of theologians, known as qualifiers, who delivered their unanimous report condemning heliocentrism as "foolish and absurd in philosophy, and formally heretical since it explicitly contradicts in many places the sense of Holy Scripture." The Inquisition also determined that Earth's motion "receives the same judgement in philosophy and ... in regard to theological truth it is at least erroneous in faith."[[126]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFavaro1907[httpswebarchiveorgweb20160513100630httpmoroimssfiitletturaLetturaWEBDLLVOL19VOLPAG320_320]-130)[[127]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-131) Bellarmine personally ordered Galileo

> _...to abstain completely from teaching or defending this doctrine and opinion or from discussing it... to abandon completely... the opinion that the sun stands still at the center of the world and the earth moves, and henceforth not to hold, teach, or defend it in any way whatever, either orally or in writing._

— Bellarmine and the Inquisition's injunction against Galileo, 1616.[[128]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHeilbron2010218-132)

In March 1616, after the Inquisition's injunction against Galileo, the papal [Master of the Sacred Palace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theologian_of_the_Pontifical_Household "Theologian of the Pontifical Household"), [Congregation of the Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congregation_of_the_Index "Congregation of the Index"), and the Pope banned all books and letters advocating the Copernican system, which they called "the false Pythagorean doctrine, altogether contrary to Holy Scripture."[[128]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHeilbron2010218-132)[[129]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-retrying-133) In 1618, the Holy Office recommended that a modified version of Copernicus' _De Revolutionibus_ be allowed for use in calendric calculations, though the original publication remained forbidden until 1758.[[129]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-retrying-133)

[Pope Urban VIII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Urban_VIII "Pope Urban VIII") encouraged Galileo to publish the pros and cons of heliocentrism. Galileo's response, _[Dialogue concerning the two chief world systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialogue\_concerning\_the\_two\_chief\_world\_systems "Dialogue concerning the two chief world systems")_ (1632), clearly advocated heliocentrism, despite his declaration in the preface that,

> _I will endeavour to show that all experiments that can be made upon the Earth are insufficient means to conclude for its mobility but are indifferently applicable to the Earth, movable or immovable..._[[130]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-Salusbury-134)

and his straightforward statement,

> _I might very rationally put it in dispute, whether there be any such centre in nature, or no; being that neither you nor any one else hath ever proved, whether the World be finite and figurate, or else infinite and interminate; yet nevertheless granting you, for the present, that it is finite, and of a terminate Spherical Figure, and that thereupon it hath its centre..._[[130]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-Salusbury-134)

Some ecclesiastics also interpreted the book as characterizing the [Pope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope "Pope") as a simpleton, since his viewpoint in the dialogue was advocated by the character [Simplicio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplicius_of_Cilicia "Simplicius of Cilicia"). Urban VIII became hostile to Galileo and he was again summoned to Rome.[[131]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKoestler1990[httpsarchiveorgdetailssleepwalkershist00koes_0page491_491]-135) Galileo's trial in 1633 involved making fine distinctions between "teaching" and "holding and defending as true". For advancing heliocentric theory Galileo was forced to recant Copernicanism and was put under house arrest for the last few years of his life. According to J. L. Heilbron, informed contemporaries of Galileo's "_appreciated that the reference to heresy in connection with Galileo or Copernicus had no general or theological significance._"[[132]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHeilbron1999[httpsbooksgooglecombooksidmZWy0xPxj3ECpgPA203_203]-136)

In 1664, [Pope Alexander VII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Alexander_VII "Pope Alexander VII") published his _[Index Librorum Prohibitorum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index\_Librorum\_Prohibitorum "Index Librorum Prohibitorum") Alexandri VII Pontificis Maximi jussu editus_ (Index of Prohibited Books, published by order of Alexander VII, [P.M.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontifex_Maximus "Pontifex Maximus")) which included all previous condemnations of heliocentric books.[[133]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-137)

Front page of the book _Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds_ (1701 edition)

[René Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes "René Descartes")' first cosmological treatise, written between 1629 and 1633 and titled _[The World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_World\_(Descartes) "The World (Descartes)")_, included a heliocentric model, but Descartes abandoned it in the light of Galileo's treatment.[[134]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-Weintraub-138) In his _[Principles of Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principles\_of\_Philosophy "Principles of Philosophy")_ (1644), Descartes introduced [a mechanical model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_explanations_of_gravitation#Vortex "Mechanical explanations of gravitation") in which planets do not move relative to their immediate atmosphere, but are constituted around space-matter [vortices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vortices "Vortices") in [curved space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curved_space "Curved space"); these rotate due to [centrifugal force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrifugal_force "Centrifugal force") and the resulting [centripetal pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centripetal_force "Centripetal force").[[135]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-139) The Galileo affair did little overall to slow the spread of heliocentrism across Europe, as Kepler's _Epitome of Copernican Astronomy_ became increasingly influential in the coming decades.[[136]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-140) By 1686, the model was well enough established that the general public was reading about it in _[Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversations\_on\_the\_Plurality\_of\_Worlds "Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds")_, published in France by [Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_le_Bovier_de_Fontenelle "Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle") and translated into English and other languages in the coming years. It has been called "one of the first great popularizations of science."[[134]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-Weintraub-138)

In 1687, [Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton") published _[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophi%C3%A6\_Naturalis\_Principia\_Mathematica "Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica")_, which provided an explanation for Kepler's laws in terms of [universal gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_gravitation "Universal gravitation") and what came to be known as [Newton's laws of motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion "Newton's laws of motion"). This placed heliocentrism on a firm theoretical foundation, although Newton's heliocentrism was of a somewhat modern kind. Already in the mid-1680s he recognized the "deviation of the Sun" from the center of gravity of the Solar System.[[137]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-141) For Newton it was not precisely the center of the Sun or any other body that could be considered at rest, but "the common centre of gravity of the Earth, the Sun and all the Planets is to be esteem'd the Centre of the World", and this center of gravity "either is at rest or moves uniformly forward in a right line". Newton adopted the "at rest" alternative in view of common consent that the center, wherever it was, was at rest.[[138]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-newt-hc-142)

Meanwhile, the Catholic Church remained opposed to heliocentrism as a literal description, but this did not by any means imply opposition to all astronomy; indeed, it needed observational data to maintain its calendar. In support of this effort it allowed the cathedrals themselves to be used as solar observatories called _[meridiane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundial#Meridian\_lines "Sundial")_; i.e., they were turned into "reverse [sundials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundial "Sundial")", or gigantic [pinhole cameras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinhole_camera "Pinhole camera"), where the Sun's image was projected from a hole in a window in the cathedral's lantern onto a meridian line.[[139]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHeilbron1999147%E2%80%93175-143)

[![Image 12](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/Wright_of_Derby%2C_The_Orrery.jpg/250px-Wright_of_Derby%2C_The_Orrery.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Wright_of_Derby,_The_Orrery.jpg)

_[A Philosopher Lecturing on the Orrery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A\_Philosopher\_Lecturing\_on\_the\_Orrery "A Philosopher Lecturing on the Orrery")_ (1766) by [Joseph Wright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Wright_of_Derby "Joseph Wright of Derby"), in which a lamp represents the Sun

In the mid-18th century the Church's opposition began to fade. An annotated copy of Newton's _Principia_ was published in 1742 by Fathers le Seur and Jacquier of the Franciscan Minims, two Catholic mathematicians, with a preface stating that the author's work assumed heliocentrism and could not be explained without the theory. In 1758 the Catholic Church dropped the general prohibition of books advocating heliocentrism from the _[Index of Forbidden Books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index\_Librorum\_Prohibitorum "Index Librorum Prohibitorum")_.[[140]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-144) The Observatory of the [Roman College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_College "Roman College") was established by [Pope Clement XIV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Clement_XIV "Pope Clement XIV") in 1774 (nationalized in 1878, but re-founded by [Pope Leo XIII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Leo_XIII "Pope Leo XIII") as the [Vatican Observatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vatican_Observatory "Vatican Observatory") in 1891). In spite of dropping its active resistance to heliocentrism, the Catholic Church did not lift the prohibition of uncensored versions of Copernicus' _De Revolutionibus_ or Galileo's _Dialogue_. The affair was revived in 1820, when the Master of the Sacred Palace (the Catholic Church's chief censor), [Filippo Anfossi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filippo_Anfossi "Filippo Anfossi"), refused to license a book by a Catholic canon, Giuseppe Settele, because it openly treated heliocentrism as a physical fact.[[141]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHeilbron2005279,_312%E2%80%93313-145) Settele appealed to pope [Pius VII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pius_VII "Pius VII"). After the matter had been reconsidered by the Congregation of the Index and the Holy Office, Anfossi's decision was overturned.[[142]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHeilbron2005279,_312-146) Pius VII approved a decree in 1822 by the [Sacred Congregation of the Inquisition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred_Congregation_of_the_Inquisition "Sacred Congregation of the Inquisition") to allow the printing of heliocentric books in Rome. Copernicus' _De Revolutionibus_ and Galileo's _Dialogue_ were then subsequently omitted from the next edition of the _Index_ when it appeared in 1835.

Three apparent proofs of the heliocentric hypothesis were provided in 1727 by [James Bradley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bradley "James Bradley"), in 1838 by [Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Wilhelm_Bessel "Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel"), and in 1851 by [Léon Foucault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A9on_Foucault "Léon Foucault"). Bradley discovered the stellar aberration, proving the relative motion of Earth. Bessel proved that the [parallax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_parallax "Stellar parallax") of a star was greater than zero by measuring the parallax of 0.314 [arcseconds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcseconds "Arcseconds") of a star named [61 Cygni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/61_Cygni "61 Cygni"). In the same year [Friedrich Georg Wilhelm Struve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Georg_Wilhelm_Struve "Friedrich Georg Wilhelm Struve") and [Thomas Henderson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_James_Henderson "Thomas James Henderson") measured the parallaxes of other stars, [Vega](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vega "Vega") and [Alpha Centauri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_Centauri "Alpha Centauri"). Experiments like those of Foucault were performed by V. Viviani in 1661 in Florence and by Bartolini in 1833 in Rimini.[[143]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-147)

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Heliocentrism&action=edit&section=24 "Edit section: Reception in Judaism")]

Already in the [Talmud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talmud "Talmud"), Greek philosophy and science under the general name "Greek wisdom" were considered dangerous. They were put under ban then and later for some periods. The first [Jewish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews "Jews") scholar to describe the Copernican system, albeit without mentioning Copernicus by name, was [Maharal of Prague](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judah_Loew_ben_Bezalel "Judah Loew ben Bezalel"), in his book "Be'er ha-Golah" (1593). Maharal makes an argument of [radical skepticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_skepticism "Radical skepticism"), arguing that no scientific theory can be reliable, which he illustrates by the new-fangled theory of heliocentrism upsetting even the most fundamental views on the cosmos.[[144]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-efron-148)

Copernicus is mentioned in the books of [David Gans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Gans "David Gans") (1541–1613), who worked with Brahe and Kepler. Gans wrote two books on astronomy in [Hebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew "Hebrew"): a short one, "Magen David" (1612), and a full one, "Nehmad veNaim" (published only in 1743). He described objectively three systems: those of Ptolemy, Copernicus and Brahe, without taking sides. [Joseph Solomon Delmedigo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Solomon_Delmedigo "Joseph Solomon Delmedigo") (1591–1655) in his "Elim" (1629) says that the arguments of Copernicus are so strong, that only an imbecile will not accept them.[[145]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-149) Delmedigo studied at [Padua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padua "Padua") and was acquainted with Galileo.[[146]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-FOOTNOTENeher1977-150)

An actual controversy on the Copernican model within Judaism arises only in the early 18th century. Most authors in this period had accepted Copernican heliocentrism, with opposition from [David Nieto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Nieto "David Nieto") and [Tobias Cohn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobias_Cohn "Tobias Cohn"), who argued against heliocentrism on the grounds it contradicted scripture. Nieto merely rejected the new system on those grounds without much passion, whereas Cohn went so far as to call Copernicus "a first-born of Satan", though he also acknowledged that he would have found it difficult to proffer one particular objection based on a passage from the Talmud.[[147]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-151)

In the 19th century, two students of the [Hatam Sofer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_Sofer "Moses Sofer") wrote books that were given approbations by him[_[who?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual\_of\_Style/Words\_to\_watch#Unsupported\_attributions "Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch")_] even though one supported heliocentrism and the other geocentrism. One, a commentary on [Genesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Genesis "Book of Genesis") titled _Yafe’ah le-Ketz_[[148]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-152) written by R. Israel David Schlesinger resisted a heliocentric model and supported geocentrism.[[149]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-153) The other, _Mei Menuchot_[[150]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-154) written by R. Eliezer Lipmann Neusatz encouraged acceptance of the heliocentric model and other modern scientific thinking.[[151]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-155)

Since the 20th century most [Jews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Jewish_astronomers "Category:Jewish astronomers") have not questioned the science of heliocentrism. Exceptions include [Shlomo Benizri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shlomo_Benizri "Shlomo Benizri")[[152]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-156) and [R. M.M. Schneerson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menachem_Mendel_Schneerson "Menachem Mendel Schneerson") of [Chabad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chabad "Chabad") who argued that the question of heliocentrism vs. geocentrism is obsolete because of the [relativity of motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_velocity "Relative velocity").[[153]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-157) Schneerson's followers in Chabad continue to deny the heliocentric model.[[154]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-158)

### William Herschel's heliocentrism

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Heliocentrism&action=edit&section=26 "Edit section: William Herschel's heliocentrism")]

[![Image 13](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Herschel-galaxy.jpg/250px-Herschel-galaxy.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Herschel-galaxy.jpg)

 William Herschel's model of the Milky Way, 1785

In 1783, amateur astronomer [William Herschel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Herschel "William Herschel") attempted to determine the shape of the universe by examining stars through his handmade [telescopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telescopes "Telescopes"). Herschel was the first to propose a model of the universe based on observation and measurement.[[155]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-159) At that time, the dominant assumption in cosmology was that the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way "Milky Way") was the entire universe, an assumption that has since been proven wrong with observations.[[156]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-sciencedirect.com-160) Herschel concluded that it was in the shape of a [disk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_galaxy "Spiral galaxy"), but assumed that the Sun was in the center of the disk, making the model heliocentric.[[157]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-Kamp-161)[[158]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-Berendzen-162)[[159]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-163)[[160]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-PBS-164)

Seeing that the stars belonging to the Milky Way appeared to encircle Earth, Herschel carefully counted stars of given apparent magnitudes, and after finding the numbers were the same in all directions, concluded Earth must be close to the center of the Milky Way. However, there were two flaws in Herschel's [methodology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology "Methodology"): magnitude is not a reliable index to the distance of stars, and some of the areas that he mistook for empty space were actually dark, obscuring nebulae that blocked his view toward the center of the Milky Way.[[161]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-Ferris-165)

The Herschel model remained relatively unchallenged for the next hundred years, with minor refinements. [Jacobus Kapteyn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobus_Kapteyn "Jacobus Kapteyn") introduced motion, [density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density "Density"), and [luminosity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminosity "Luminosity") to Herschel's star counts, which still implied a near-central location of the Sun.[[157]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-Kamp-161)

### Replacement with galactocentrism and acentrism

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Heliocentrism&action=edit&section=27 "Edit section: Replacement with galactocentrism and acentrism")]

Already in the early 19th century, [Thomas Wright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Wright_(astronomer) "Thomas Wright (astronomer)") and [Immanuel Kant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant "Immanuel Kant") speculated that fuzzy patches of light called [nebulae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebula "Nebula") were actually distant "island universes" consisting of many [stellar systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_system "Star system").[[162]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-Harrison-166) The shape of the Milky Way galaxy was expected to resemble such "islands universes."

However, "scientific arguments were marshalled against such a possibility," and this view was rejected by almost all scientists until the early 20th century, with [Harlow Shapley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlow_Shapley "Harlow Shapley")'s work on [globular clusters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globular_cluster "Globular cluster") and [Edwin Hubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble "Edwin Hubble")'s measurements in 1924. After Shapley and Hubble showed that the Sun is not the center of the universe, cosmology moved on from heliocentrism to [galactocentrism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactocentrism "Galactocentrism"), which states that the Milky Way is the center of the universe.[[156]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-sciencedirect.com-160)

Hubble's observations of redshift in light from distant galaxies indicated that the universe was [expanding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansion_of_the_universe "Expansion of the universe") and acentric.[[158]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-Berendzen-162) As a result, soon after galactocentrism was formulated, it was abandoned in favor of the [Big Bang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang "Big Bang") model of the acentric expanding universe. Further assumptions, such as the [Copernican principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copernican_principle "Copernican principle"), the [cosmological principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_principle "Cosmological principle"), [dark energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_energy "Dark energy"), and [dark matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter "Dark matter"), eventually lead to the current model of cosmology, [Lambda-CDM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda-CDM "Lambda-CDM").

### Special relativity and the "center"

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Heliocentrism&action=edit&section=28 "Edit section: Special relativity and the \"center\"")]

The concept of an absolute velocity, including being "at rest" as a particular case, is ruled out by the [principle of relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_relativity "Principle of relativity"), also eliminating any obvious "center" of the universe as a natural origin of coordinates. Even if the discussion is limited to the [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System "Solar System"), the Sun is not at the geometric center of any planet's orbit, but rather approximately at one [focus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_(geometry) "Focus (geometry)") of the [elliptical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipse "Ellipse") orbit. Furthermore, to the extent that a planet's mass cannot be neglected in comparison to the Sun's mass, the center of gravity of the Solar System is displaced slightly away from the center of the Sun.[[138]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-newt-hc-142) (The masses of the planets, mostly [Jupiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter "Jupiter"), amount to 0.14% of that of the Sun.) Therefore, a hypothetical astronomer on an [extrasolar planet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrasolar_planet "Extrasolar planet") would observe a small "wobble" in the Sun's motion.[[163]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-167)

### Modern use of _geocentric_ and _heliocentric_

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Heliocentrism&action=edit&section=29 "Edit section: Modern use of geocentric and heliocentric")]

In modern calculations, the terms "geocentric" and "heliocentric" are often used to refer to [reference frames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_of_reference "Frame of reference").[[164]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-168) In such systems the origin in the [center of mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_mass#Barycenter_in_astrophysics_and_astronomy "Center of mass") of Earth, of the Earth–Moon system, of the Sun, of the Sun plus the major planets, or of the entire Solar System, can be selected.[[165]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism#cite_note-169)[Right ascension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_ascension "Right ascension") and [declination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declination "Declination") are examples of geocentric coordinates, used in Earth-based observations, while the heliocentric latitude and longitude are used for orbital calculations. This leads to such terms as "heliocentric [velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity "Velocity")" and "heliocentric [angular momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_momentum "Angular momentum")". In this heliocentric picture, any planet of the Solar System can be used as a source of [mechanical energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_energy "Mechanical energy") because it moves relatively to the Sun. A smaller [body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_body "Physical body") (either [artificial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft "Spacecraft") or [natural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_object "Astronomical object")) may gain heliocentric velocity due to [gravity assist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_assist "Gravity assist")– this effect can change the body's mechanical energy in heliocentric reference frame (although it will not changed in the planetary one). However, such selection of "geocentric" or "heliocentric" frames is merely a matter of computation. It does not have philosophical implications and does not constitute a distinct physical or [scientific model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_model "Scientific model"). From the point of view of [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity"), [inertial reference frames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_reference_frame "Inertial reference frame") do not exist at all, and any practical reference frame is only an approximation to the actual space-time, which can have higher or lower precision. Some forms of [Mach's principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach%27s_principle "Mach's principle") consider the frame at rest with respect to the distant masses in the universe to have special properties.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]
