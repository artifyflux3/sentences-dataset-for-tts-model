[ 1 ] [ 2 ] National character has been studied within the fields of anthropology, sociology, and psychology.

[ 3 ] The question of whether analysis and descriptions of national characters express meaningful content, as opposed to comprising inaccurate stereotypes , is controversial.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] Most of the research on national character has focused on the content, stability, accuracy, and origins of national character stereotypes.

[ 2 ] A 1985 cross-national study of national character found fundamental differences between the psychological profiles of the respective national populations of France , Germany , Great Britain , Italy , Russia , and the United States .

[ 2 ] Some studies comparing national character stereotypes with assessed personality traits find a moderate relationship between stereotype and reality, while others have found perceptions of national character to be unfounded and poorly related.

[ 2 ] [ 6 ] Academic interest in national character peaked around World War II , with two anthropologists in 1969 identifying 1935 to 1945 as the field's seminal period, and declined in the decades that followed due to changes in academic thought.

[ 7 ] Jerome Braun wrote in 2014 that "the study of national character nowadays is considered somewhat old-fashioned because the most famous period devoted to this study, the period immediately after World War II, eventually reached a point of exhaustion, intellectual and otherwise, as studies were attacked for superfic and bias on the part of the researchers."
