As of September 2021 [update] , the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has evaluated the conservation status of 15 species within Chromista .

[ 1 ] The IUCN has not evaluated any protist species other than those in Phaeophyceae. No Chromista subspecies or subpopulations have been evaluated.  No evaluated Chromista species are confirmed to be extinct , but four are tagged as possibly extinct.

As of 2005 [update] the New Zealand Threat Classification System has evaluated 38 species of macroalgae as Threatened and 23 as Data Deficient.

[ 2 ] Some of these species are only of concern nationally.
