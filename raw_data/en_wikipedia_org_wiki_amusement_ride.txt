Early pleasure wheel in Russia , 1807 Amusement rides , sometimes called carnival rides , are mechanical devices or structures that move people to create fun and enjoyment.

Rides are often perceived by many as being scary or more dangerous than they actually are. This could be due to the design, having acrophobia , or from hearing about accidents involving rides that are similar.

[ 1 ] For some, the adrenaline associated with riding amusement rides is part of the experience.

[ 2 ] They are common at most annual events such as fairs , traveling carnivals , and circuses around the world. Sometimes music festivals and concerts also host amusement park rides.

Types of rides [ edit ] Flat rides are usually those that move their passengers on a plane generally parallel to the ground, such as rides that spin around a vertical axis, like carousels and twists ; and ground-level rides such as bumper cars .

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] The term is also used to refer to amusement rides that are not classified as dark rides, rollercoasters, transport rides, or water rides.

In gravity rides , gravity is responsible for all or some of the movement where any vertical movement is not about a fixed point, such as roller coasters , water slides and drop towers .

[ 3 ] Vertical rides usually move their passengers in a vertical plane and around a fixed point, such as Ferris wheels , Enterprise and Skydiver .

[ 3 ] As of the 2010s, some rides employ virtual reality .

It generates a significant amount of centrifugal force, causing the riders on the inside of the seats to crush the riders on the outside of the seats. It was once found at nearly every amusement park around the United States, but is now so rare that an original Caterpillar ride can only be found operating in two parks today.
