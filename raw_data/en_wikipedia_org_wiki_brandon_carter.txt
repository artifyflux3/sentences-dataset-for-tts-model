C. Lin Brandon Carter , FRS (born 1942) is an Australian theoretical physicist who explores the properties of black holes , and was the first to name and employ the anthropic principle in its contemporary form. He is a researcher at the Meudon campus of the Laboratoire Univers et Théories, part of the French CNRS .

Biography [ edit ] Carter studied at the University of Cambridge under Dennis Sciama .  He found the exact solution of the geodesic equations for the Kerr/Newman electrovacuum solution , and the maximal analytic extension of this solution. In the process, he discovered the extraordinary fourth constant of motion and the Killing–Yano tensor. Together with Werner Israel and Stephen Hawking , he proved partially the no-hair theorem in general relativity , stating that all stationary black holes are completely characterized by mass , charge , and angular momentum . In 1982 with astrophysicist Jean-Pierre Luminet , he invented the concept of tidal disruption event (TDE) , namely the destruction of a star passing in the vicinity of a supermassive black hole. They showed that this phenomenon could result in the violent destruction of the star in the form of a  "stellar pancake", causing a reactivation of nuclear reactions in the core of the star in the stage of its maximum compression.

More recently, Carter, Chachoua, and Chamel (2005) have formulated a relativistic theory of elastic deformations in neutron stars .
