[ 5 ] [ 9 ] In May 2014, Soni transferred to India where he was in charge of launching the Huffington Post in the country.

[ 10 ] He left the company before the launch to focus on writing a book.

[ 11 ] Later, reports surfaced saying more than a book prompted his departure: internal complaints and a sexual harassment investigation of his management style were cited by current and former employees at the time. Arianna Huffington declined to comment on the matter.

[ 24 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ] In an interview with the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers , Soni explained that part of the reason he wrote A Mind at Play was that he was drawn to Shannon's personality and wanted to read a biography about him, but, "it turned out there wasn’t one."
