He is an Associate Professor in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Cornell University , and he is also a Fields Member in the School of Applied and Engineering Physics and the Department of Computer Science at Cornell .

Wilde's research spans quantum information theory [ 1 ] [ 2 ] (including communication trade-offs, [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] quantum rate-distortion [ 7 ] [ 8 ] ), network quantum information, [ 9 ] quantum error correction , [ 10 ] [ 11 ] quantum optical communication, [ 12 ] [ 13 ] quantum computational complexity , [ 14 ] and quantum entropy inequalities .

[ 15 ] [ 16 ] His research results on quantum entropy inequalities, [ 17 ] time travel and quantum cloning, [ 18 ] trade-offs in quantum communication, [ 19 ] and quantum entanglement measures [ 20 ] have been communicated in popular science media.

He has written or coauthored two textbooks on quantum information theory .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] The first textbook [ 1 ] utilizes the von Neumann entropy and its variants and the notion of typical subspace to present the capacities of quantum communication channels . The second textbook [ 2 ] utilizes the Renyi entropy and its variants, the hypothesis testing relative entropy , and the smooth max-relative entropy to present the capacities of quantum communication channels . It also has a part dedicated to foundational concepts in quantum information and entanglement theory and another part to feedback-assisted capacities, representing more recent developments from 2013 and on.

Education [ edit ] Wilde graduated from Jesuit High School in New Orleans , Louisiana in 1998.

[ 21 ] He received his bachelor's degree in computer engineering from Texas A&M University in 2002, with support from the Thomas Barton Scholarship. He received his Master's degree in electrical engineering from Tulane University in 2004.

[ 22 ] He received his Ph.D. in electrical engineering from University of Southern California in 2008, under the supervision of Todd Brun and with support from a School of Engineering Fellowship.

[ 23 ] His Ph.D. thesis was entitled "Quantum Coding with Entanglement" [ 24 ] [ 25 ] and contributed to the theory of entanglement-assisted quantum error correction . During this time, he also received the Best Teaching Assistant Award from the Department of Electrical Engineering at USC.

[ citation needed ] After his Ph.D. studies, he conducted postdoctoral work in the School of Computer Science at McGill University from 2009–2013 under the supervision of Patrick Hayden , focusing on the topics of quantum information theory , quantum error correction , and quantum computational complexity .

[ 26 ] Career [ edit ] During the summer of 2013, he was a visiting scholar at Raytheon BBN Technologies and the Research Laboratory of Electronics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .

[ 27 ] In August 2013, he became an assistant professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy [ 28 ] and the Center for Computation and Technology at Louisiana State University (LSU). In August 2018, he was promoted to associate professor with tenure.

[ 29 ] He is also affiliated with the Hearne Institute for Theoretical Physics at LSU.

[ 30 ] From January 2020 until December 2020, he was a visiting professor at the Stanford Institute for Theoretical Physics (on sabbatical leave from LSU).

[ 31 ] In July 2022, he became Associate Professor in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Cornell University .

[ 32 ] He was associate editor for Quantum Information Theory for IEEE Transactions on Information Theory from May 2015 to December 2021 [ 33 ] and for New Journal of Physics from January 2018 until January 2022.

[ 34 ] He has been on the editorial board for Quantum Information Processing [ 35 ] since March 2012.

[ 36 ] He co-organized the Southwest Quantum Information and Technology Workshop [ 37 ] in 2017 and 2018 and the Beyond i.i.d. in Information Theory Conference [ 38 ] in 2015, 2016, and 2020. He was the program committee chair for the 2018 Quantum Communication, Measurement, and Computing [ 39 ] Conference and the 2017 Conference on Theory of Quantum Computation, Communication, and Cryptography.
