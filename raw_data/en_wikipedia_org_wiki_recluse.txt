Cell of a recluse with hagioscope in Bro Church, Gotland , Sweden A recluse is a person who lives in voluntary seclusion and solitude . The word is from the Latin recludere , which means 'to open' or 'disclose'.

Examples of recluses are Symeon of Trier , who lived within the great Roman gate Porta Nigra with permission from the Archbishop of Trier , or Theophan the Recluse , a 19th-century Orthodox Christian monk who was later venerated as a saint . Many celebrated figures of human history have spent significant portions of their lives as recluses.

In the Russian Orthodox and Catholic Church tradition, a Poustinik is a temporary hermit who has been called to pray and fast alone in a cabin for at least 24 hours. In ancient Chinese culture, scholars are encouraged to be a public servant in a scrupulous and well-run government but expected to go into reclusion as a yinshi (隐士, 'gentleman-in-hiding') when the government is rife with corruption.

[ 1 ] Others, like Dongfang Shuo , became hermits to practice Taoism , or in later centuries, Chan Buddhism .
