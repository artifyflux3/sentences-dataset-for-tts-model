 You deserve an explanation 

August 17: An important update for readers in the United States. 

Please don't skip this 1-minute read. It's Sunday, August 17, and we're running a short fundraiser to support Wikipedia. If you've lost count of how many times you've visited Wikipedia this year, we hope that means it's given you at least $2.75 of knowledge. Please join the 2% of readers who give what they can to keep this valuable resource ad-free and available for all.

After nearly 25 years, Wikipedia is still the internet we were promised—created by people, not by machines. It's not perfect, but it's not here to push a point of view. It's owned by a non-profit, not a giant technology company or a billionaire.

Most readers donate because Wikipedia is useful to them, others because Wikipedia is more important than ever. If you feel the same, please donate $2.75 now—or consider a monthly gift to help all year. Thank you.

N-dimensional generalisation of a pyramid

4-dimensional hyperpyramid with a cube as base

In [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry"), a **hyperpyramid** is a generalisation of the normal [pyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_(geometry) "Pyramid (geometry)") to n[dimensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension "Dimension").

In the case of the pyramid one connects all [vertices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_(geometry) "Vertex (geometry)") of the [base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_(geometry) "Base (geometry)") (a [polygon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon "Polygon") in a plane) to a point outside the plane, which is the [peak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apex_(geometry) "Apex (geometry)"). The pyramid's height is the distance of the peak from the plane. This construction gets generalised to n dimensions. The base becomes a (_n_ – 1)-[polytope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytope "Polytope") in a (_n_ – 1)-dimensional [hyperplane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplane "Hyperplane"). A point called apex is located outside the hyperplane and gets connected to all the vertices of the polytope and the distance of the apex from the hyperplane is called height. This construct is called a n-dimensional hyperpyramid.

A normal [triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle "Triangle") is a 2-dimensional hyperpyramid, the [tetrahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahedron "Tetrahedron") or triangular pyramid is a 3-dimensional hyperpyramid, and the [pentachoron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentachoron "Pentachoron") or tetrahedral pyramid is a 4-dimensional hyperpyramid with a tetrahedron as base.

The n-dimensional volume of a n-dimensional hyperpyramid can be computed as follows: V n=A⋅h n{\displaystyle V_{n}={\frac {A\cdot h}{n}}}![Image 20: {\displaystyle V_{n}={\frac {A\cdot h}{n}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7141523f8e1d810bf33ae2c26acedb8651f5886e) Here V n denotes the n-dimensional volume of the hyperpyramid, A the (_n_ – 1)-dimensional volume of the base and h the height, that is the distance between the apex and the (_n_ – 1)-dimensional hyperplane containing the base A. For _n_ = 2, 3 the formula above yields the standard formulas for the area of a triangle and the volume of a pyramid.

Elements

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hyperpyramid&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Elements")]

A hyperpyramid with a [polyhedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyhedron "Polyhedron") base with [f-vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-vector "F-vector") (_v_,_e_,_f_) (vertices, edges, and faces), will have a new f-vector (1+_v_, _v_+_e_, _e_+_f_, _f_+1).

For example, a [cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cube "Cube") has f-vector (8,12,6), 8 vertices, 12 edges, and 6 square faces. Its [cubic pyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_pyramid "Cubic pyramid") has 1+8 vertices, 20 edges (8 lateral, and 12 base), 18 faces (12 lateral triangles and 6 base squares), and 7 cells (6 lateral [square pyramids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_pyramid "Square pyramid") and 1 cubic base).

In a general for _n_-[polytopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytope "Polytope"), extended f-vector elements expand like [polynomial expansion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_expansion "Polynomial expansion"). An extended f-vector will be (1,f 0,f 1,f 2,f _n_-1,1) transform to polynomial coefficients, (1+f 0⋅_x_+f 1⋅_x_ 2+f 2⋅_x_ 3+...+_x_ _n_)(1+_x_). [Abstractly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_polytope "Abstract polytope"), this is a join operator, making new elements by joining all permutations of cross elements, including 1 [nullitope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nullitope "Nullitope") (f 0), and 1 body (f _n_). The apex point has no proper elements, just the 1 nullitope and 1 body.

A _n_-[simplex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex#Elements "Simplex") is a recursive pyramid of points (1-simplex, base point) [line segment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_segment "Line segment") to (2-simplex, base segment) [triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle "Triangle") to (3-simplex, base triangle) [tetrahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahedron "Tetrahedron") to (4-simplex, base tetrahedron) [5-cell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-cell "5-cell"), etc. Their extended f-vector follows [Pascal triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_triangle "Pascal triangle"), like coefficients (1+_x_)_n_+1 (joining _n_+1 points). The first and last coefficients are the 1 nullitope and 1 body.
