Antisemitism has long existed in the United States. It includes antisemitic attitudes, including those of organised hate groups such as the Ku Klux Klan and those more widely disseminated in the population; antisemitic behaviors that can threaten the security of American Jews (measured by the occurrence of specific incidents, including hate crimes ), and discrimination against Jews, threatening their secure status in country.

In terms of antisemitic attitudes, according to a survey which was conducted by the Anti-Defamation League in 2019, antisemitism is rejected by a majority of Americans, with 79% of them lauding Jews' cultural contributions to the nation. The same poll found that 19% of Americans adhered to the longstanding antisemitic canard that Jews co-control Wall Street , [ 1 ] while 31% agreed with the statement "Jewish employers go out of their way to hire other Jews".

[ 2 ] Organised antisemitic groups are mainly from a white nationalism or white supremacist background, but the Nation of Islam and some branches of the Black Hebrew Israelites have also been identified as antisemitism, reflecting heightened levels of antisemitism among some African-American communities.

In terms of antisemitic incidents, FBI data shows that in every year since 1991, Jews were the most frequent victims of religiously motivated hate crimes .

[ 3 ] The number of hate crimes against Jews may be underreported, as in the case for many other targeted groups.

[ 4 ] Anti-Jewish discrimination has been a strong element of the history of antisemitism in the United States but is less prevalent in the current century.

There have been a range of approaches to combating antisemitism, including by the government (such as the Biden administration 's U.S. National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism ) and by Jewish communities.

There is some evidence for the intensification of antisemitism since the Israel/Gaza war that began in October 2023 . According to an August 2024 survey by the Combat Antisemitism Movement , 3.5 million Jews in America have experienced antisemitism since the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel . Of the 1,075 American Jews interviewed, 28% claimed to have heard that "Jews care too much about money", 25% heard "Jews control the world", 14% heard "American Jews care more about Israel than about the US", and 13% heard "the Holocaust did not happen" or its "severity has been exaggerated".

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] The FBI 's 2023 statistics state that antisemitic incidents accounted for 68% of all religion-based hate crimes, a 63% bump vis-à-vis 2022, while the American Jewish Committee (AJC) said that it was "likely much lower" than the actual number as hate crimes had been "widely underreported across the country".

antisemitism in the United States Historically, antisemitic attitudes and rhetoric have tended to increase whenever the United States has faced a serious economic crisis, [ 8 ] as well as during moments of political and social uncertainty and fear, such as with the rise of nativist anti-immigration organizing in the early twentieth century, the emergence of the Nazi -affiliated German-American Bund in the 1930s, and the anti-Communist political movement during McCarthyism , also known as the Red Scare .

[ 9 ] Academic David Greenberg has written in Slate , "Extreme anti-communism always contained an antisemitic component: Radical, alien Jews, in their demonology , orchestrated the Communist conspiracy." He also has argued that, in the years which followed World War II , some groups on " the American right remained closely tied to the unvarnished antisemites of the '30s who railed against the 'Jew Deal'", a bigoted term which was used against the New Deal measures of President Franklin D. Roosevelt .

[ 10 ] American antisemites have viewed the fraudulent text The Protocols of the Elders of Zion as a real reference to a supposed Jewish cabal which was out to subvert and ultimately destroy the U.S.

[ 11 ] Both the association of Jews with Communism and the fixation on a Jewish cabal purported in The Protocols of the Elders of Zion are conspiracies transplanted to the American context from European modernity: in a moment of economic revolution and socialist politics rising in contexts across Europe, conservative leaders from Christian Russia to interwar Great Britain manipulated a public fear of Jewish Bolshevism to scapegoat Jewish populations for strategic political gain.

[ 12 ] The " Great Replacement " theme, a version of the broader white genocide conspiracy theory , was stressed by people who highlighted the supposed threat of Jews and other immigrants replacing Americans who were born in the country.

[ 13 ] In the 1920s and 1930s, antisemitic activists were led by Henry Ford and other figures like Charles Lindbergh , William Dudley Pelley , Charles Coughlin and Gerald L. K. Smith , and some of them were also members of organizations like the America First Committee , the Christian Nationalist Crusade , the German American Bund , the Ku Klux Klan and the Silver Legion of America . They promulgated canards and various interrelated conspiracy theories that widely spread the fear that, through an evil transnational network, Jews were working for the destruction or replacement of white Americans along with the fear that Jews were working for the destruction or replacement of Christianity in the United States .

[ 14 ] [ 15 ] American viewpoints on Jews and antisemitism [ edit ] Main articles: Racial antisemitism and Religious antisemitism Tropes and stereotypes [ edit ] Main articles: Antisemitic trope and Stereotypes of Jews The most persistent form of antisemitism has consisted of a series of widely circulating tropes and stereotypes in which Jews are portrayed as being socially, religiously, and economically unacceptable to American life, because of their inferiority to white Christian society or because of conspiratorial thinking in which Jews are accused of plotting to undermine the racial and economic hierarchies which make up the historical fabric of American society . As a whole, the Jewish people were looked down upon. They were made to feel unwanted, they were marginalized by American society and they were considered a menace to the United States.

[ 16 ] Martin Marger wrote, "A set of distinct and consistent negative stereotypes, some of which can be traced as far back as the Middle Ages in Europe , has been applied to Jews ." [ 17 ] David Schneder wrote, "Three large clusters of traits are part of the Jewish stereotype (Wuthnow, 1982). First, [American] Jews are seen as being powerful and manipulative. Second, they are accused of dividing their loyalties between the United States and Israel. A third set of traits concerns Jewish materialistic values, aggressiveness, clannishness." [ 18 ] Stereotypes of Jewish people share some of the same content as stereotypes of Asians : perceived disloyalty, power, intelligence, and dishonesty overlap. The similarity between the content of stereotypes of Jews and the content of stereotypes of Asians may stem from the fact that many immigrant Jews and many immigrant Asians both developed a merchant role, a role which was also historically held by many Indians in East Africa , where the content of stereotypes of them resembles the content of stereotypes of Asians and Jews in the United States .

[ 19 ] Some of the antisemitic tropes which have been cited by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) in its studies of U.S. social trends include the claims that "Jews have too much power in the business world," "Jews are more willing to use shady practices to get what they want," and "Jews always like to be at the head of things." Another issue that garners attention is the assertion that Jews have an excessive amount of influence on American cinema and news media . Put together, these lines of thinking about Jews demonstrate a common trend in the history of both American and global antisemitism—the inflation of stereotypes of Jews into a theory about how power (politics, economics, media, etc.) functions in society, an irrational theory that deflects responsibility for social ills away from actual authorities and leaders and onto minority Jewish communities.

[ 20 ] In contemporary alt-right and right-wing circles, these tropes of power-hungry Jews sometimes manifest through coded references to "globalists," accusations that liberal agendas are the sole product of prominent Jews, and conspiracy theories (such as QAnon ) that can be linked to the medieval blood libel against Jews.

[ 21 ] Statistics of American viewpoints and analysis [ edit ] Polls and studies point to a steady decrease in antisemitic attitudes, beliefs, and manifestations among the American public.

[ 20 ] [ 22 ] A 1992 survey by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) showed that about 20% of Americans—between 30 and 40 million adults—held antisemitic views, a considerable decline from the total of 29% found in 1964. However, another survey by the same organization concerning antisemitic incidents showed that the curve has risen without interruption since 1986.

[ 22 ] 2005 survey [ edit ] The number of Americans holding antisemitic views declined markedly six years later when another ADL study classified only 12 percent of the population—between 20 and 25 million adults, as "most antisemitic." Confirming the findings of previous surveys, both studies also found that African Americans were significantly more likely than whites to hold antisemitic views, with 34 percent of blacks classified as "most antisemitic," compared to 9 percent of whites in 1998.

[ 22 ] The 2005 Survey of American Attitudes Towards Jews in America, a national poll of 1,600 American adults conducted in March 2005, found that 14% of Americans—or nearly 35 million adults—hold views about Jews that are "unquestionably antisemitic," compared to 17% in 2002, In 1998, the number of Americans with hardcore antisemitic beliefs had dropped to 12% from 20% in 1992.

The 2005 survey found "35 percent of foreign-born Hispanics (down from 44% [in 2002])" and 36 percent of African-Americans hold strong antisemitic beliefs, four times more than the 9 percent for whites." [ 23 ] The 2005 Anti-Defamation League survey includes data on Hispanic attitudes, with 29% being most antisemitic (as opposed as 9% for whites and 36% for blacks), being born in the United States lessened the prevalence of that attitude: 35% of foreign-born Hispanics and only 19% of those born in the US.

[ 23 ] The survey findings come at a time of increased antisemitic activity in America. The 2004 ADL Audit of Antisemitic Incidents reported that antisemitic incidents reached their highest level in nine years. A total of 1,821 antisemitic incidents were reported in 2004, an increase of 17% over the 1,557 incidents reported during 2003.

[ 24 ] "What concerns us is that many of the gains we had seen in building a more tolerant and accepting America seem not to have taken hold as firmly as we had hoped," said Abraham H. Foxman, ADL National Director. "While there are many factors at play, the findings suggest that antisemitic beliefs endure and resonate with a substantial segment of the population, nearly 35 million people." After 2005 [ edit ] In 2007 an ABC News report recounted that past ABC polls across several years have tended to find that about 6% of Americans self-report prejudice against Jews as compared to about 25% being against Arab Americans and about 10% against Hispanic Americans . The report also remarked that a full 34% of Americans reported having "some racist feelings" in general as a self-description.

[ 25 ] A 2009 study which was titled "Modern Anti-Semitism and Anti-Israeli Attitudes", published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology in 2009, tested a new theoretical model of antisemitism among Americans in the Greater New York area with three experiments. The research team's theoretical model proposed that mortality salience (reminding people that they will someday die) increases antisemitism and that antisemitism is often expressed as anti-Israel attitudes. The first experiment showed that mortality salience led to higher levels of antisemitism and lower levels of support for Israel. The study's methodology was designed to tease out antisemitic attitudes that are concealed by polite people. The second experiment showed that mortality salience caused people to perceive Israel as very important, but did not cause them to perceive any other country this way. The third experiment showed that mortality salience led to a desire to punish Israel for human rights violations but not to a desire to punish Russia or India for identical human rights violations. According to the researchers, their results "suggest that Jews constitute a unique cultural threat to many people's worldviews, that antisemitism causes hostility to Israel, and that hostility to Israel may feed back to increase antisemitism." Furthermore, "those claiming that there is no connection between antisemitism and hostility toward Israel are wrong." [ 26 ] The 2011 Survey of American Attitudes Toward Jews in America released by the ADL found that the recent world economic recession increased some antisemitic viewpoints among Americans.

Abraham H. Foxman , the organization's national director, argued, "It is disturbing that with all of the strides we have made in becoming a more tolerant society, antisemitic beliefs continue to hold a vice-grip on a small but not insubstantial segment of the American public." Specifically, the polling found that 19% of Americans answered "probably true" to the assertion that "Jews have too much control/influence on Wall Street" while 15% concurred with the related statement that Jews seem "more willing to use shady practices" in business. Nonetheless, the survey generally reported positive attitudes for most Americans, the majority of those who were surveyed expressed philo-Semitic sentiments such as 64% agreeing that Jews have contributed much to U.S. social culture.

[ 1 ] Antisemitism within the African-American community [ edit ] See also: African American–Jewish relations , Black Hebrew Israelites , Black-Palestinian solidarity , Interminority racism in the United States , and Nation of Islam and antisemitism Surveys which were conducted by the ADL in 2007, 2009, 2011, and 2013 all found that an overwhelming majority of African-Americans who were questioned rejected antisemitism and they generally expressed the same kinds of tolerant viewpoints as other Americans who were also surveyed. For example, the results of the ADL's 2009 study revealed that 28% of African-Americans who were surveyed expressed antisemitic views while a 72% majority did not. However, those three surveys all revealed that negative attitudes towards Jews were stronger among African-Americans than they were among the general population at large.

[ 27 ] According to earlier ADL research, dating back to 1964, the trend that African-Americans are significantly more likely to hold antisemitic beliefs across all education levels than white Americans has remained unchanged over the years. Nonetheless, the percentage of the population which holds a negative opinion of Jews has also waned considerably in the black community during this period. In 1967, the New York Times Magazine published the article " Negroes Are Anti-Semitic Because They're Anti-White " in which the African-American author James Baldwin sought to explain the prevalence of black antisemitism.

[ 28 ] [ 29 ] An ADL poll from 1992 stated that 37% of African-Americans surveyed displayed antisemitism; [ 20 ] in contrast, a poll from 2011 found that only 29% did so.

[ 27 ] The more education people have the less antisemitic they are. In 1998 among blacks with no college education, 43% fell into the most antisemitic group (versus 18% of the general population) compared to only 27% among blacks with some college education and just 18% among blacks with a four-year college degree (versus 5% of people in the general population with a four-year college degree).

[ 20 ] At all educational levels, Blacks were more likely than whites to accept anti-Jewish stereotypes.

[ 30 ] [ better source needed ] Brookings Institution fellow Jamie Kirchick said in 2018 that antisemitism has been a particular problem in parts of America's black community since the split between the mainstream Civil rights movement led by Martin Luther King Jr.

and the more radical Black Power movement of the late 1960s.

[ 31 ] [ undue weight?

– discuss ] A 2019 study found that 28% of African Americans believed that they were seeing more Black people that they personally knew express antisemitism than in the past.

[ 32 ] In the same study, 19% of African Americans believed that Jewish people were impeding Black progress in America.

[ 32 ] Four percent (4%) of African Americans self-identified as being Black Hebrew Israelites in 2019.

[ 32 ] Prominent African-American figures Louis Farrakhan and Kanye West have received widespread condemnation for propagating antisemitism.

[ 33 ] Holocaust denial [ edit ] Further information: Holocaust denial Austin App (1902–1984), a German-American La Salle University professor of medieval English literature , is considered the first major American Holocaust denier.

[ 34 ] App wrote extensively in newspapers and periodicals, and he also wrote a couple of books which detailed his defense of Nazi Germany and Holocaust denial . App's work inspired the Institute for Historical Review , a California center which was founded in 1978 with the sole purpose of denying the Holocaust.

[ 35 ] One of the newer forms of antisemitism is the denial of the Holocaust by negationist historians and neo-Nazis .

[ 36 ] The results of a survey which was conducted in 2020 revealed that close to two-thirds of Millennials and Gen Z adults were not aware that 6 million Jews were killed in the Holocaust.

[ 37 ] [ 38 ] 24% of them believed that the Holocaust might be a myth or that accounts of it are exaggerated.

[ 37 ] [ 39 ] Antisemitic organizations [ edit ] White nationalists and white supremacists [ edit ] Main article: Fascism in the United States This section needs expansion . You can help by adding to it .

( May 2019 ) The flag of the Knights Party, the political branch of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan There are a number of antisemitic organizations in the United States, some of them violent, which espouse religious antisemitism , racial antisemitism , white nationalism and white supremacy . They include Christian Identity Churches, White Aryan Resistance , the Ku Klux Klan , the American Nazi Party , and many other organizations. Several fundamentalist churches, such as the Westboro Baptist Church and the Faithful Word Baptist Church , also preach antisemitic messages . The largest neo-Nazi organizations in the United States are the National Nazi Party and the National Socialist Movement . Adopting the look and emblems of white power skinheads , many members of these antisemitic groups shave their heads and tattoo themselves with Nazi symbols such as swastikas , SS insignias , and " Heil Hitler ". Additionally, antisemitic groups march and preach antisemitic messages throughout America.

[ 40 ] Although most American Jews are of European descent and 80% to 90% of them identify as white (as noted by Ilana Kaufman of the Jewish Community Relations Council ), white nationalists hate the religious and ethnic diversity that Jews represent.

[ 41 ] Nation of Islam [ edit ] Main article: Nation of Islam and antisemitism Further information: Antisemitism in Islam A number of Jewish organizations, Christian organizations, Muslim organizations, and academics consider the Nation of Islam antisemitic. Specifically, they claim that the Nation of Islam has engaged in revisionist and antisemitic interpretations of the Holocaust and exaggerates the role of Jews in the Atlantic slave trade .

[ 42 ] [ failed verification ] In December 2012, the Simon Wiesenthal Center put the NOI's leader Louis Farrakhan on its list of the ten most prominent antisemites in the world. He was the only American to make it onto the list. The organization cited statements that he had made in October of that year in which he claimed that "Jews control the media" and "Jews are the most violent of people".

[ 43 ] Farrakhan has denied charges of antisemitism, but in his denial, he included a reference to " Satanic Jews " and in another speech referred to Jews as termites .

[ 44 ] After he was banned from Facebook , he denied being a "hater" but admitted that Facebook's designation of him as a "dangerous individual" was correct.

[ 46 ] However, in 2013 the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) reported a multi-year slide in antisemitism, including a 19% decline in 2013.

[ 47 ] During the 2013 knockout game spate of violent assaults, all reported "knockout" assaults in New York City targeted Jews.

[ 48 ] ABC Nightline reported that New York City police believed that antisemitism was likely to be a motive in the attacks, as all eight victims were identified as Jewish.

[ 49 ] The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) organizes Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) which are designed to collect and evaluate statistics of offenses which are committed in the U.S. In 2014, 1,140 victims of anti-religious hate crimes were listed, of which 56.8% were motivated by offenders' anti-Jewish biases. 15,494 law enforcement agencies contributed to the UCR analysis.

[ 50 ] [ 51 ] According to the American Enterprise Institute , Jews were the most likely of any group, religious or otherwise, to be targeted for hate crimes in the U.S. in 2018, [ 52 ] 2016, [ 53 ] and 2015.

[ 54 ] The New York Times reported that Jews were the most targeted in proportion to their population size in 2005, [ 55 ] and they were the second-most targeted individuals after LGBT individuals in 2014.

[ 55 ] [ 56 ] The NYPD reported a 75% increase in the amount of swastika graffiti between 2016 and 2018, with an uptick observed after the Pittsburgh shooting. Out of 189 hate crimes in New York City in 2018, 150 featured swastikas.

[ 57 ] In 2018 and 2019, antisemitism in the United States was reported to have increased compared to previous years according to statistics collected by both the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the ADL. These statistics include both violent antisemitic attacks on Jews and cases of harassment.

[ 58 ] [ 59 ] [ 60 ] The ADL reported that antisemitism in the U.S. had reached "near‑historic levels," with 1,879 attacks recorded against individuals and institutions during 2018, "the third‑highest year on record since the ADL started tracking such data in the 1970s." [ 61 ] On February 1, 2019, graffiti which read "fucking Jews" was found on the wall of a synagogue in LA.

[ 62 ] During Hanukkah festivities in December 2019, a number of attacks committed in New York were possibly motivated by antisemitism, including a mass stabbing in Monsey .

[ 63 ] 2018 Pittsburgh synagogue shooting [ edit ] Main article: Pittsburgh synagogue shooting People paying their respects at a memorial to the victims of the Tree of Life synagogue The Pittsburgh synagogue shooting was a terrorist attack in the form of a mass shooting , which took place at the Tree of Life – Or L'Simcha Congregation [ 64 ] synagogue in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh. The congregation, along with New Light Congregation and Congregation Dor Hadash, which also worshipped in the building, was attacked during Shabbat morning services on October 27, 2018. The perpetrator killed eleven people and wounded six. It was the deadliest attack ever on the Jewish community in the United States. A lone suspect, identified as 46-year-old Robert Gregory Bowers, was arrested at the scene. In 2023, he was tried in federal court and sentenced to death.

[ 65 ] 2019 Poway synagogue shooting [ edit ] Main article: Poway synagogue shooting The Poway synagogue shooting occurred on April 27, 2019, at Chabad of Poway synagogue in Poway, California . It came on the last day of the Jewish Passover holiday, which fell on a Shabbat . Armed with an AR-15–style rifle , the gunman, John Earnest, a White supremacist and Christian traditionalist , fatally shot one woman and injured three other persons, including the synagogue's rabbi. A month before the shooting, Earnest had attempted to burn down a mosque in Escondido . In September 2021, Earnest was sentenced by a state court to life in prison without the possibility of parole.

[ 66 ] 2019 Jersey City shooting [ edit ] This section is an excerpt from 2019 Jersey City shooting .

[ edit ] Khal Adas Greenville and JC Kosher Supermarket (August 2019) On December 10, 2019, a shooting took place at a kosher grocery store in the Greenville section of Jersey City, New Jersey . Three people were killed at the store by two assailants, David N. Anderson and Francine Graham. The assailants also wounded one customer and two police officers before being killed by police during an ensuing shootout. A Jersey City Police Department detective had also been shot and killed by the assailants at a nearby cemetery just before the grocery store attack.

[ 67 ] [ 68 ] [ 69 ] Anderson, who identified as a Black Hebrew Israelite , had a history of posting antisemitic and anti-law enforcement messages on social media; Attorney General of New Jersey Gurbir Grewal stated that evidence indicated that the attacks were acts of hate and domestic terrorism which were fueled by antisemitism and anti-police sentiment . Authorities believe that a much larger attack had been planned, but it was thwarted by the police detective's intervention at the cemetery. The shooting was part of a wave of violent attacks against Jews in the United States .

[ 70 ] [ 71 ] [ 72 ] 2019 saw a spate of attacks in which pedestrians wearing identifiably Jewish clothing were assaulted, beaten and often knocked to the ground by an assailant or group of assailants, many of whom shouted antisemitic slurs.

[ 73 ] [ 74 ] The assailants were black and Hispanic.

[ 75 ] One assailant, Tiffany Harris, who was released without bail after attacking a Jewish woman, attacked three other Jewish women the very next day; all of the victims were dressed in distinctively Jewish clothing.

[ 76 ] Although the Williamsburg and Crown Heights neighborhoods of Brooklyn where most of the assaults have taken place are experiencing gentrification, no similar assaults have been reported on the gentrifiers, although their clothing makes them easy to identify.

[ 75 ] In May 2021, there was an upsurge of violent assaults on Jews in the United States at the same time as the Gaza conflict , according to the Secure Community Network and Network Contagion Research Institute.

[ 77 ] Maugham Elementary School Adolf Hitler assignment controversy [ edit ] Main article: Maugham Elementary School Adolf Hitler assignment controversy In early April 2021, [ 78 ] a fifth-grade teacher at Maugham Elementary School, a public grammar school in Tenafly, New Jersey , instructed a 5th grade student to dress up as Adolf Hitler and write a first-person essay from the perspective of the Nazi leader touting his "accomplishments" as a part of a class assignment.

[ 79 ] [ 80 ] [ 81 ] [ 82 ] [ 83 ] The student wrote a biography of Hitler that glorified the Nazi leader, stated that Hitler's "greatest accomplishment was uniting a great mass of German and Austrian people" in his support, framed the Holocaust in a positive light, and added that Hitler was "pretty great".

[ 80 ] [ 84 ] [ 85 ] The student's essay was displayed publicly within the school's hallway during the month of April.

[ 78 ] [ 80 ] [ 86 ] [ 87 ] [ 88 ] In May 2021, the details of the school assignment became known to the public, leading to outrage in the community, which has a substantial Jewish population.

[ 78 ] [ 80 ] [ 86 ] [ 89 ] After initially defending the teacher and the school's actions and asserting that "it is unfair to judge any student or teacher in this matter", [ 90 ] [ 91 ] [ 92 ] the board of Tenafly Public Schools suspended the teacher and the principal of the school with pay in June 2021 and opened an investigation into the incident.

[ 93 ] [ 84 ] Following the investigation, the teacher resigned and the principal was reinstated.

[ 94 ] [ 95 ] 2023 Los Angeles shooting [ edit ] In February 2023, 28-year-old Jaime Tran shot two Jewish men when they were leaving religious services at two separate synagogues in the same predominantly Jewish neighborhood of Los Angeles, California. According to the police, the victims were carried to a hospital in stable condition. Tran was arrested by police and admitted he shot the men for being Jewish. Tran, who often posted far-right antisemitic content online, may be sentenced to life in prison.

[ 96 ] 2023 New Jersey arson attacks [ edit ] In June 2023, four Jewish homes were set on fire, one of which was destroyed completely, and fourteen others were sprayed with antisemitic graffiti including swastikas and other Neo‑Nazi and white supremacist symbols in Toms River, New Jersey . A Hispanic family was targeted too. The perpetrator of these attacks, Ronald "Ron" Carr, 35, from nearby Manchester , told the police that he acted to "save the neighborhood" from Jews, who "are ruining the world" and "should be a dying breed".

[ 97 ] He was sentenced to seven years in prison.

[ 98 ] [ 99 ] [ 100 ] 2023–2024 [ edit ] In 2023, antisemitic hate crimes accounted for almost half of the total hate crimes committed in New York State .

[ 101 ] According to a report published by Florida Attorney-General Ashley Moody , the number of antisemitic crimes in Florida increased by 94% in 2023 compared to 2022. These crimes occurred on campuses, in places of worship, and in other areas. Moody also called to action: "To protect Jewish Americans, we took action – calling for a zero-tolerance policy for hate crimes and urging Florida college and university police chiefs to protect Jewish students and other religious groups".

[ 102 ] According to the Massachusetts Executive Office of Public Safety and Security 's Hate Crimes in Massachusetts 2023 report, the number of antisemitic crimes in Florida increased by 70% in 2023 compared to 2022.

[ 102 ] A September 2024 survey showed that 3.5 million adult American Jews – about one third of American Jews – experienced some form of antisemitism in the year following the Hamas-led attacks of 7 October 2023 .

[ 103 ] [ 104 ] According to a 2025 report by Tel Aviv University , several major U.S. cities recorded an increase in antisemitic hate crimes in 2024 compared to previous years.

New York City , home to the largest Jewish population in the country, reported 344 incidents, up from 325 in 2023 and 264 in 2022. Similarly, Chicago saw an increase to 79 incidents in 2024, compared to 50 in 2023 and 39 in 2022.

Austin reported a rise to 15 cases in 2024, from six in 2023 and four in 2022, while Denver experienced a sharp increase to 31 cases in 2024 from nine the previous year.

[ 107 ] In August 2024, the U.S.

Department of Homeland Security announced that it had allocated $454.5 million for the 2024 fiscal year to securing Jewish religious institutions in light of rising antisemitism.

[ 108 ] This is a $150 million increase from the 2023 budget.

[ 108 ] Also in August 2024, AIPAC 's headquarters in Washington, D.C. were vandalized by anti‑Israel activists.

[ 109 ] [ 110 ] This happened around the same time as swastikas were graffitied throughout a NYC neighborhood, [ 111 ] and four Maryland schools were vandalized with anti‑Israel and antisemitic graffiti.

[ 112 ] New York Police Department reported 19 antisemitic incidents in New York City in August 2024 alone, [ 113 ] with a total of 117 incidents between January and the end of September 2024, a 74% increase from the same period the previous year.

[ 114 ] In September 2024, the FBI reported that there was a 63% increase in antisemitic incidents in the U.S. in 2023 from the previous year, for a total of an all-time high of 1,832 recorded incidents.

[ 115 ] Antisemitism has also been reported during the 2024 and 2025 pro-Palestinian protests on university campuses , [ 116 ] [ 117 ] as well as complaints about antisemitism in various public school districts.

[ 118 ] According to the FBI’s annual Hate Crime Report, published in August 2025, the year 2024 recorded a new high in antisemitic incidents in the United States, with a total of 1,938 antisemitic hate crimes. The report further noted that, although Jews constitute only 2% of the U.S. population, they were the target of 69% of all religion-based hate crimes.

[ 119 ] 2025 [ edit ] Jerusalem Coffee House In June, the Justice Department announced that it filed a lawsuit against the owners of the Jerusalem Coffee House in Oakland, California . The lawsuit alleges that the defendants discriminated against Jewish customers, in violation of Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination based on race, color, religion, or national origin in places of public accommodation.

[ 120 ] [ 121 ] Also in June, U.S. Democratic Representative Mark Pocan incited controversy with a tweet directed at white house deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller , who is Jewish, telling him to "go back to 1930's Germany". The White House demanded an apology, which Pocan refused.

[ 122 ] In July, videos resurfaced that had been shared by Democratic New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani that depicted Indian men wearing traditional jewish garments in front of a menorah and spinning dreidels . The video was described as "sick" by antisemitism awareness groups, which renewed calls for Mamdani to condemn the phrase " globalize the intifada ." [ 123 ] Also in July, parents of three students at the Nysmith school in Herndon, Virginia filed a civil rights complaint against the school, alleging widespread and persistent atisemitic bullying of the pupils at the school. The complaint alleges that students drew a large image of Adolph Hitler during an assignment to draw a "great historical leader", and telling the three jewish students that jews are "baby killers" who deserved to die. The three jewish students were expelled in the aftermath of the complaint.

[ 124 ] American rapper Kanye West released a antisemitic song called “ Heil Hitler ”. It was banned from streaming platforms.

[ 125 ] In the aftermath of Hurricane Helene [ edit ] In October 2024, in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene , there were complains of online posts containing antisemitic rhetoric and threatening violence against FEMA officials have surfaced in the aftermath of the storm.

[ 126 ] [ 127 ] Many were disturbed at the speed at which these false claims were spread.

[ 131 ] 2024 – A pro-Palestinian rally taking place outside a Synagogue in Los Angeles, California turned into a chaotic street violence with pro-Israel counterprotesters.

[ 132 ] Several officials, including President Joe Biden , have criticized the incident as antisemitic.

[ 132 ] A Jewish woman was beaten at the scene.

[ 133 ] At least two lawsuits have been filed against the protest groups, alleging that they violated the law by blocking people from attending a religious event.

[ 134 ] 2024 – A visibly Jewish man was attacked while walking down the street in Norman, Oklahoma by a man who called him a "dirty Jew". The victim was taken to the hospital suffering from bruises and a cerebral hemorrhage, making international news.

[ 135 ] However, the Norman Police Department later stated that obtained video footage depicted "significant disagreement" with this narrative and that the "reporting party, initially reported as the victim" of a hate crime was shown on video to actually be the "aggressor," who engaged an individual in a series of "mutual combat." [ 136 ] 2025 - an Egyptian national named Mohamed Soliman was charged after using a garden sprayer filled with gasoline and a Molotov cocktail to injure 15 people and kill another in an antisemitic attack in Boulder, Colorado [ 137 ] Soliman had previously attempted to purchase a firearm but was denied; police stated that he stated that this was because of his immigration status.

[ 138 ] [ 139 ] Democrats condemned the attack and used the incident to promote gun control.

[ 140 ] 2025 - Jewish U.S. Representative Max Miller from Ohio said he was run off the road in an antisemitic road rage incident while driving to work. The suspect, who later turned himself in to authorities, reportedly used antisemitic slurs, waved a Palestinian flag , and threatened Miller and his family.

[ 141 ] [ 142 ] [ 143 ] Antisemitism on college campuses [ edit ] Further information: Universities and antisemitism , Academic boycott of Israel § United States , Qatari involvement in higher education in the United States , and Antisemitism and higher education in the United States Many Jewish intellectuals who fled from Nazi Germany after Adolf Hitler's rise to power in the 1930s immigrated to the United States . There, they hoped to continue their academic careers, but barring a scant few, they found little acceptance in elite institutions in Depression-era America with its undercurrent of antisemitism. Instead, they found work in historically black colleges and universities in the American South .

[ 144 ] [ 145 ] On April 3, 2006, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights announced its finding that incidents of antisemitism are a "serious problem" on college campuses throughout the United States. The Commission recommended for the U.S. Department of Education 's Office for Civil Rights to protect college students from antisemitism by vigorous enforcement of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 . It further recommended for the U.S. Congress to clarify that Title VI applies to discrimination against Jewish students.

[ 146 ] In February 2015, the Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law and Trinity College [ 147 ] presented the results of a national survey of American Jewish college students. The survey had a 10–12% response rate and did not claim to be representative. The report showed that 54% of the 1,157 self-identified Jewish students at 55 campuses nationwide who took part in the online survey reported having experienced or witnessed antisemitism on their campuses during the Spring semester of the last academic year.

A 2017 report by Brandeis University 's Steinhardt Social Research Institute indicated that most Jewish students never experience anti-Jewish remarks or physical attacks. The study, "Limits to Hostility," notes that even though it is often reported in the news, actual antisemitic hostility remains rare on most campuses and is seldom encountered by Jewish students.

[ 148 ] The study attempted to document the student experience at the campus level, adding detail to previous national-level surveys.

[ 149 ] : 5 The report summary highlights the finding that antisemitism exists on campus, but "Jewish students do not think their campus is hostile to Jews." The National Demographic Survey of American Jewish College Students provided a snapshot of the type, context, and location of antisemitism as it was experienced by a large national sample of Jewish students on university and four-year college campuses.

[ 150 ] Inside Higher Ed focused on the more surprising findings of the report, like the fact that high rates of antisemitism were also reported at institutions regardless of their location or type, and the data collected after the survey suggests that discrimination occurs during low-level, everyday interpersonal activities, and Jewish students feel that their reports of antisemitism are largely ignored by the administration.

[ 151 ] However, not all of the reception was positive, and The Forward argued that the study documented only a snapshot in time, rather than a trend; it did not survey a representative sample of Jewish college students; and it was flawed by allowing students to define antisemitism and thus the term open to interpretation.

[ 152 ] In September 2021, in collaboration with the Cohen Group, the Brandeis Center conducted a poll of American Jewish fraternity and sorority members. The survey found that more than 65% of the respondents had experienced or were familiar with an antisemitic attack in the previous 120 days. Nearly half of the respondents felt the need to hide their Jewish identity out of fear.

[ 153 ] December 2023, antisemitism hearing in Congress The October 7, 2023 Israel–Hamas conflict has significantly impacted the prevalence of antisemitism on college campuses across the United States. Many Jewish students and organizations have reported an increase in harassment, discrimination, and intimidation during and after protests linked to the conflict. Examples include instances of swastika graffiti on campus property, the assault of students for expressing pro-Israel views, and overall increases in antisemitic acts, especially on college campuses.

[ 154 ] [ 155 ] [ 156 ] These incidents have intensified debates over free speech and the responsibilities of universities to address hate speech.

Reports from the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) highlight a marked increase in antisemitic incidents following October 7, 2023. The ADL documented 5,204 antisemitic incidents in the months following the conflict, a sum greater than the total amount of incidents from all of 2022. On college campuses, incidents spiked by 321%, totaling 922 reported cases. Fifty-two percent of post-October 7 incidents referenced Israel, Zionism, or Palestine. Despite the focus on these geopolitical issues, antisemitic incidents unrelated to Israel also increased by 65% year-over-year, underscoring the widespread nature of the problem.

[ 156 ] In January 2025, Harvard University settled two civil rights lawsuits alleging inadequate protection of Jewish students from antisemitism on campus. As part of the settlement, Harvard adopted the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of antisemitism in its nondiscrimination policies. The agreement also included commitments to provide expert training on antisemitism for staff and students, clarify that targeting Zionists constitutes harassment, and an undisclosed monetary payment. While Harvard denied any wrongdoing, this settlement highlights increasing attention to antisemitism within U.S. higher education. The adoption of the IHRA definition remains controversial, with supporters advocating for its comprehensive approach to combating antisemitism and critics warning against potential restrictions on free speech.

[ 157 ] [ 158 ] [ 159 ] Efforts to combat antisemitism [ edit ] Protest against the detention of Mahmoud Khalil , who was charged with antisemitism, New York City on March 10, 2025 President Donald Trump declared himself to be a supporter of Israel and American Jews. Trump signed the Executive Order on Combating Anti-Semitism .

[ 160 ] However, a 2019 survey by the Jewish Electorate Institute found that 73% of American Jews feel less secure since the election of Donald Trump to the presidency. Since 2016, antisemitic attacks against synagogues have contributed to this fear. The 2019 survey found that combatting antisemitism is a priority issue in domestic politics among American Jews, including millennials .

[ 161 ] Prominent members of the African-American community have spoken out against antisemitism, including Kareem Abdul-Jabbar [ 162 ] and Zach Banner .

[ 163 ] In December 2022, taking a joint stand against increasing instances of racism and antisemitism in the United States, African-American leaders New York City Mayor Eric Adams , Reverends Al Sharpton and Conrad Tillard , and Vista Equity Partners CEO and Carnegie Hall Chairman Robert F. Smith , joined Jewish leaders Rabbi Shmuley Boteach and Elisha Wiesel , and jointly hosted 15 Days of Light, celebrating Hanukkah and Kwanzaa in a unifying holiday ceremony at Carnegie Hall.

[ 164 ] Sharpton said: "There is never a time more needed than now for Blacks and Jews to remember the struggle that we've gone through. You can't fight for anybody if you don't fight for everybody. I cannot fight for Black rights if I don't fight for Jewish rights ... because then it becomes a matter of self-aggrandizement rather than fighting for humanity. It's easy for Blacks to stand up for racism. It's easy for Jews to stand up to antisemitism. But if you want to really be a leader, you got to speak as a Black against antisemitism and antisemites, and you got to speak as a Jew against racism." [ 165 ] [ 166 ] Smith said: "When we unify the souls of our two communities, we can usher in light to banish the darkness of racism, bigotry, and antisemitism." [ 165 ] Leo Terrell , the head of the Trump administration's Task Force to Combat Antisemitism, with President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on April 7, 2025 In 2023, the Biden administration launched [ 167 ] the U.S. National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism , and in 2024, the US State Department (together with 35 other countries) released non-binding global guidelines for countering antisemitism.

[ 168 ] [ 169 ] [ 170 ] In August 2024, the US Department of Homeland Security announced that it had allocated $454.5 million for the 2024 fiscal year to securing Jewish religious institutions in light of rising antisemitism.

[ 108 ] This is a $150 million increase from the 2023 budget.

[ 108 ] In February 2025, Leo Terrell , the chair of the Department of Justice's Task Force to Combat Antisemitism, announced that he would investigate Columbia University , Harvard University , George Washington University , Johns Hopkins University , New York University , Northwestern University , Berkeley University , the University of California , the University of Minnesota , and the University of Southern California as part of the Department of Justice's broader investigation into antisemitism on college campuses.
