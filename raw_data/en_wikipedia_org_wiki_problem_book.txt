Problem books are distinct from workbooks in that the problems are designed as a primary means of teaching, not merely for practice on material learned elsewhere.  Problem books are found most often in the mathematical and physical sciences; they have a strong tradition within the Russian educational system.

[ 1 ] At some American universities, problem books are associated with departmental preliminary or candidacy examinations for the Ph.D. degree .  Such books may exemplify decades of actual examinations and, when published, are studied by graduate students at other institutions.

[ 1 ] Other problem books are specific to graduate fields of study. While certain problem books are collected, written, or edited by worthy but little-known toilers, others are done by renowned scholars and researchers.

The casebook for law and other non-technical fields can provide a similar function.
