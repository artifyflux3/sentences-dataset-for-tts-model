Muhammad Husayn ibn Muhammad Hadi, known as Hakim Muhammad Hadikhan , is mostly known for two Persian compendia on simple and compound remedies: Majma‘ al-javami‘ va-zakha'ir al-tarakib , which he composed in 1771 and based largely upon a treatise titled Jami‘ al-javami‘ by his great-uncle Alavi Shirazi , and the Makhzan al-adviyah which is a verbatim reproduction of the alphabetical pharmacopeia in the Jami‘ al-javami‘ of his great-uncle.

Muhammad Hadikhan also composed a number of smaller medical treatises, among them a treatise on smallpox .
