It replaced The Cambridge History of India published between 1922 and 1937.

The new history is being published as a series of individual works by single authors and, unlike the original, does not form a connected narrative.

[ 1 ] Also unlike the original, it only covers the period since the fourteenth century . The whole has been planned over four parts: Pt. I The Mughals and their Contemporaries.

Pt. II Indian States and the Transition to Colonialism .

Pt. III The Indian Empire and the beginnings of Modern Society .

Pt. IV The Evolution of Contemporary South Asia.
