It lies between Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands . Many major battles were fought there during World War II .

Extent [ edit ] The International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of the Solomon Sea as follows: [ 1 ] On the Northwest.

By the Southeast limit of Bismarck Sea [A line from the Southern point of New Ireland along the parallel of 4°50' South to the coast of New Britain , along its Northern coast and thence a line from its Western extreme through the Northern point of Umboi Island to Teliata Point, New Guinea ( 5°55′S 147°24′E ﻿ / ﻿ 5.917°S 147.400°E ﻿ / -5.917; 147.400 )].

On the Northeast.

By a line from the Southern point of New Ireland to the North point of Buka Island , through this island to the Northwest point of Bougainville Island , along the Southern coasts of Bougainville, Choisel [ Choiseul ], Ysabel [ Santa Isabel ], Malaita and San Cristobal [ Makira ] Islands.

On the South.

The Northern limit of the Coral Sea between San Cristobal Island, the Solomon Islands , and Gado-Gadoa Island, off the Southeast extreme of New Guinea [Gado-Gadoa Island near its Southeastern extreme ( 10°38′S 150°34′E ﻿ / ﻿ 10.633°S 150.567°E ﻿ / -10.633; 150.567 ), down this meridian to the 100-fathom [600 ft; 183 m] line and thence along the Southern edges of Uluma (Suckling) Reef and those extending to the Eastward as far as the Southeast point of Lawik Reef ( 11°43.5′S 153°56.5′E ﻿ / ﻿ 11.7250°S 153.9417°E ﻿ / -11.7250; 153.9417 ) off Tagula Island [ Vanatinai ], thence a line to the Southern extreme of Rennell Island and from its Eastern point to Cape Surville, the Eastern extreme of San Cristobal Island].

On the Southwest.

By the coast of New Guinea and a line from its Southeasternmost point through the Louisiade Archipelago to Rossel Island .

Etymology [ edit ] The Solomon Sea is named after the Solomon Islands . These islands received their name "Islas Salomón" from the legend of the biblical land of Ophir — fabled as the source of King Solomon 's wealth which was hoped to be discovered, in the first 1568 voyage by their discoverer Spanish navigator Álvaro de Mendaña de Neira . They were so named after his voyage when it was mapped.

[ 2 ] Deepest point [ edit ] The Solomon Sea roughly corresponds with the Solomon Sea Plate , a tectonic feature, [ 3 ] and includes the New Britain Trench , in the New Britain subduction zone , which reaches its maximum depth at 29,988 feet (9,140 m) below sea level in the Planet Deep.
