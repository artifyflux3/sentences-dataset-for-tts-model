Kuo Zing-yang (or Z. Y. Kuo ; simplified Chinese : 郭任远 ; traditional Chinese : 郭任遠 ; pinyin : Guō Rènyuǎn ; Jyutping : Kuo Yam6 Yun5 ; 1898–1970) was a Chinese experimental and physiological psychologist . He was a renowned educator and is also notable as having been the President of Zhejiang University , who was expelled by Zhejiang students in 1935.

[ 1 ] Kuo was known as "Out-Watsons Mr. Watson" in the international anti-instinct movement.

[ 2 ] Biography [ edit ] Kuo was born in Shantou , Guangdong Province in 1898. Kuo studied at Fudan University in Shanghai. In 1918, Kuo went to study in the United States. In 1923, while studying at UC Berkeley , Kuo was offered the chance to earn a Ph.D. However, the school suggested he change some parts of his thesis. Rather than making those changes, Kuo chose to stick with his original work and decided not to present his thesis, which meant he couldn't earn his doctorate.

[ 3 ] Kuo went back to China , and founded the Department of Psychology at Fudan University in 1924.

[ 4 ] Kuo was a professor, the Vice-president ; and from April 1924 to November 1925, the acting President of Fudan University.

[ 5 ] From 1927 to 1936, Kuo taught at National Central University [ 6 ] and Zhejiang University. From 1933 to 1936, Kuo was the President of Zhejiang University , and did the most important research of his academic career - about animal's behavior epigenetics .

[ 3 ] In December 1935, the December 9th Movement broke out, which led to a large student strike in Zhejiang University. There were some severe conflicts between Kuo and some students and faculty, and Kuo was described as "autocratic" in the handling this incident.

Chiang Kai-shek then intervened, leading to Kuo's resignation from his university president position.

[ 3 ] From 1936 to 1945, Kuo was a visiting scholar to United States, and did research and lectured in several American universities . Kuo was a visiting professor of UC Berkeley, Yale University and the University of Rochester , and a researcher at Carnegie Institution in Washington, D.C..

[ 7 ] From 1946 to 1970, Kuo resided in Kowloon , Hong Kong. Kuo was a trustee of the University of Hong Kong . Kuo died in Hong Kong on 14 August 1970 at age 72.
