Ball of crumpled paper In geometry and topology , crumpling is the process whereby a sheet of paper or other two-dimensional manifold undergo disordered deformation to yield a three-dimensional structure comprising a random network of ridges and facets with variable density. The geometry of crumpled structures is of interest to mathematicians studying topology.

[ 1 ] Crumpled paper balls have been studied and found to exhibit surprisingly complex structures with compressive strength resulting from frictional interactions at locally flat facets between folds.

[ 2 ] The unusually high compressive strength of crumpled structures relative to their density is of interest in the disciplines of materials science and mechanical engineering .

Significance [ edit ] The packing of a sheet by crumpling is a complex phenomenon that depends on material parameters and the packing protocol. Thus the crumpling behaviour of foil, paper and poly-membranes differs significantly and can be interpreted on the basis of material foldability.

[ 3 ] The high compressive strength exhibited by dense crumple formed cellulose paper is of interest towards impact dissipation applications and has  been proposed as an approach to utilising waste paper .

[ 4 ] From a practical standpoint, crumpled balls of paper are commonly used as toys for domestic cats .
