( August 2011 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) eTBLAST was a free text-similarity service now defunct. It was initially developed by Alexander Pertsemlidis and Harold “Skip” Garner in 2005 at The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center . It offered access to the following databases: MEDLINE National Institutes of Health (NIH) CRISP Institute of Physics (IOP) Wikipedia arXiv NASA technical reports Virginia Tech class descriptions others of clinical interest eTBLAST searched citation databases [ 1 ] and databases containing full-text such as PUBMED . It compared a user’s natural-text query with target databases utilizing a hybrid-search algorithm. The algorithm consisted of a low-sensitivity, weighted, keyword-based first pass followed by a novel second pass based on sentence alignment. eTBLAST later became a web-based service of The Innovation Laboratory at the Virginia Bioinformatics Institute .

The text-similarity engine studied duplicate publications and potential plagiarism in biomedical literature. eTBLAST received thousands of random samples of Medline abstracts for a large-scale study. Those with the highest similarity were assessed then entered into an on-line database. The work revealed several trends including an increasing rate of duplication in the biomedical literature, according to prominent scientific journals Bioinformatics , [ 2 ] Anaesthesia and Intensive Care , [ 3 ] Clinical Chemistry , [ 4 ] Urologic oncology , [ 5 ] Nature , [ 6 ] and Science .
