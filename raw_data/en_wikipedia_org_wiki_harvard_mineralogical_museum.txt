It is one of the three research museums which collectively comprise the collection of the Harvard Museum of Natural History .

[ 1 ] History [ edit ] Harvard professor Louis Agassiz oversaw the construction of the University Museum building to house a museum of comparative zoology; the building was completed in 1859. Its collections soon expanded beyond comparative zoology into other natural sciences. In 1901, Alexander Agassiz , son of Louis Agassiz , formally established a Geological Museum. In 1966, the Mineralogical Museum (formed separately) and the Geological Museum merged.

[ 2 ] Collection [ edit ] The museum's collection is the oldest University collection in the country. It was established by Benjamin Waterhouse , co-founder of and professor at Harvard Medical School , in 1784. In 1805, the collection held 1,600 specimens.

[ 3 ] [ 2 ] [ 4 ] Today, the museum holds 400,000 specimens.
