( November 2022 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Food packaging printed in CMYK to faithfully reproduce the color of the pictured fruits. A process control patch from elsewhere on the same box helps ensure proper color reproduction.

Color reproduction is an aspect of color science concerned with producing light spectra that evoke a desired color , either through additive (light emitting) or subtractive (surface color) models. It converts physical correlates of color perception ( CIE 1931 XYZ color space tristimulus values and related quantities) into light spectra that can be experienced by observers. In this way, it is the opposite of colorimetry .

It is concerned with the faithful reproduction of a color in one medium, with a color in another, so it is a central concept in color management and relies heavily on color calibration . For example, food packaging must be able to faithfully reproduce the colors of the foods therein in order to appeal to a customer.

[ 1 ] This involves proper color calibration of at least four devices: Lighting, which must have a high color rendering index and not give a color cast to the object.

Camera, which measures the reflected spectrum of the object and converts to a trichromatic color space (e.g.

RGB ).

Screen, which reproduces color so a designer can proof the captured image and make color corrections as necessary.

Printer, which reproduces the final color on paper.
