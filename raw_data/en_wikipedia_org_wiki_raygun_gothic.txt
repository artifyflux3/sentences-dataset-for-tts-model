Raygun Gothic is a catchall term for a visual and architectural style that, when applied to retrofuturistic science fiction environments, incorporates various aspects of the Googie , Streamline Moderne , and Art Deco architectural styles. Academic Lance Olsen has characterised Raygun Gothic as "a tomorrow that never was".

[ 1 ] The style has also been associated with architectural indulgence, and situated in the context of the golden age of modern design due to its use of features such as "single-support beams , acute angles , brightly colored paneling", as well as "shapes and cutouts showing motion".

[ 2 ] Origin [ edit ] The term was coined by William Gibson in his 1981 story " The Gernsback Continuum ": [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Cohen introduced us and explained that Dialta [a noted pop-art historian] was the prime mover behind the latest Barris-Watford project, an illustrated history of what she called "American Streamlined Modern." Cohen called it "raygun Gothic." Their working title was The Airstream Futuropolis: The Tomorrow That Never Was.
