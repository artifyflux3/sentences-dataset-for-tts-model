This article is about the principle in mechanics. For the work arrangement, see [remote work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_work "Remote work").

In [mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics "Mechanics"), **virtual work** arises in the application of the _[principle of least action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stationary-action\_principle "Stationary-action principle")_ to the study of [forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forces "Forces") and [movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion "Motion") of a [mechanical system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_system "Mechanical system"). The [work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(physics) "Work (physics)") of a force acting on a particle as it moves along a [displacement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_(geometry) "Displacement (geometry)") is different for different displacements. Among all the possible displacements that a particle may follow, called [virtual displacements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_displacement "Virtual displacement"), one will minimize the [action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_(physics) "Action (physics)"). This displacement is therefore the displacement followed by the particle according to the principle of least action.

> The work of a force on a particle along a virtual displacement is known as the virtual work.

Historically, virtual work and the associated [calculus of variations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_of_variations "Calculus of variations") were formulated to analyze systems of rigid bodies,[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_work#cite_note-Lanczos-1) but they have also been developed for the study of the mechanics of deformable bodies.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_work#cite_note-2)

The **principle of virtual work** had always been used in some form since antiquity in the study of statics. It was used by the Greeks, medieval Arabs and Latins, and Renaissance Italians as "the law of lever".[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_work#cite_note-capecchi-3) The idea of virtual work was invoked by many notable physicists of the 17th century, such as Galileo, Descartes, Torricelli, Wallis, and Huygens, in varying degrees of generality, when solving problems in statics.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_work#cite_note-capecchi-3) Working with Leibnizian concepts, [Johann Bernoulli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Bernoulli "Johann Bernoulli") systematized the virtual work principle and made explicit the concept of infinitesimal displacement. He was able to solve problems for both rigid bodies as well as fluids. Bernoulli's version of virtual work law appeared in his letter to [Pierre Varignon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Varignon "Pierre Varignon") in 1715, which was later published in Varignon's second volume of _Nouvelle mécanique ou Statique_ in 1725. This formulation of the principle is today known as the principle of virtual velocities and is commonly considered as the prototype of the contemporary virtual work principles.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_work#cite_note-capecchi-3) In 1743 D'Alembert published his _Traité de Dynamique_ where he applied the principle of virtual work, based on Bernoulli's work, to solve various problems in dynamics. His idea was to convert a dynamical problem into static problem by introducing _inertial force_.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_work#cite_note-dugas-4) In 1768, [Lagrange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange "Lagrange") presented the virtual work principle in a more efficient form by introducing generalized coordinates and presented it as an alternative principle of mechanics by which all problems of equilibrium could be solved. A systematic exposition of Lagrange's program of applying this approach to all of mechanics, both static and dynamic, essentially [D'Alembert's principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%27Alembert%27s_principle "D'Alembert's principle"), was given in his _Mécanique Analytique_ of 1788.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_work#cite_note-capecchi-3) Although Lagrange had presented his version of [least action principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_action_principle "Least action principle") prior to this work, he recognized the virtual work principle to be more fundamental mainly because it could be assumed alone as the foundation for all mechanics, unlike the modern understanding that least action does not account for non-conservative forces.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_work#cite_note-capecchi-3)

If a force acts on a particle as it moves from point ![Image 1: {\displaystyle A}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3) to point ![Image 2: {\displaystyle B}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/47136aad860d145f75f3eed3022df827cee94d7a), then, for each possible trajectory that the particle may take, it is possible to compute the total work done by the force along the path. The _principle of virtual work_, which is the form of the principle of least action applied to these systems, states that the path actually followed by the particle is the one for which the difference between the work along this path and other nearby paths is zero (to the first order). The formal procedure for computing the difference of functions evaluated on nearby paths is a generalization of the derivative known from differential calculus, and is termed _the calculus of variations_.

Consider a point particle that moves along a path which is described by a function ![Image 3: {\displaystyle \mathbf {r} (t)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7216e69d28fdb11c29c859f015a284c1ec6f06ac) from point ![Image 4: {\displaystyle A}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3), where ![Image 5: {\displaystyle \mathbf {r} (t=t_{0})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5ca9da2f07b3e049302eed5cae6b90763b639c9d), to point ![Image 6: {\displaystyle B}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/47136aad860d145f75f3eed3022df827cee94d7a), where ![Image 7: {\displaystyle \mathbf {r} (t=t_{1})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/36e6bba09d3ab0493bd4f203c804e7f2424aa449). It is possible that the particle moves from ![Image 8: {\displaystyle A}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3) to ![Image 9: {\displaystyle B}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/47136aad860d145f75f3eed3022df827cee94d7a) along a nearby path described by ![Image 10: {\displaystyle \mathbf {r} (t)+\delta \mathbf {r} (t)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/39b704b5bfe906748008f1df1d8cc0eaa62d3fe8), where ![Image 11: {\displaystyle \delta \mathbf {r} (t)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3b088032c4126a930a66abe22344bc26bd393301) is called the variation of ![Image 12: {\displaystyle \mathbf {r} (t)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7216e69d28fdb11c29c859f015a284c1ec6f06ac). The variation ![Image 13: {\displaystyle \delta \mathbf {r} (t)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3b088032c4126a930a66abe22344bc26bd393301) satisfies the requirement ![Image 14: {\displaystyle \delta \mathbf {r} (t_{0})=\delta \mathbf {r} (t_{1})=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a8b32320e7be0f7e4857a7aa07fc9d9221aa74be). The scalar components of the variation ![Image 15: {\displaystyle \delta r_{1}(t)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/32a781b2103f107d3f0fa8ccb9857a1ac935fa65), ![Image 16: {\displaystyle \delta r_{2}(t)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/de9858689d28448260f9743b7ced9cfef8d4b8ff) and ![Image 17: {\displaystyle \delta r_{3}(t)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/26aca11d07c433488d4acc10352d652a9aa94fa6) are called virtual displacements. This can be generalized to an arbitrary mechanical system defined by the [generalized coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_coordinates "Generalized coordinates")![Image 18: {\displaystyle q_{i}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2752dcbff884354069fe332b8e51eb0a70a531b6), ![Image 19: {\displaystyle i=1,2,...,n}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/daff11f8a99a009698fc116a303769863a68cd35). In which case, the variation of the trajectory ![Image 20: {\displaystyle q_{i}(t)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/23a92e30dd438adbdca7b4774ef4b285b411dd64) is defined by the virtual displacements ![Image 21: {\displaystyle \delta q_{i}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/46f900082d2724712416ca12ed2536bd336fcd6b), ![Image 22: {\displaystyle i=1,2,...,n}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/daff11f8a99a009698fc116a303769863a68cd35).

Virtual work is the total work done by the applied forces and the inertial forces of a mechanical system as it moves through a set of virtual displacements. When considering forces applied to a body in static equilibrium, the principle of least action requires the virtual work of these forces to be zero.

Mathematical treatment
----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Virtual_work&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Mathematical treatment")]

Consider a particle _P_ that moves from a point _A_ to a point _B_ along a trajectory **r**(_t_), while a force **F**(**r**(_t_)) is applied to it. The work done by the force **F** is given by the integral ![Image 23: {\displaystyle W=\int _{\mathbf {r} (t_{0})=A}^{\mathbf {r} (t_{1})=B}\mathbf {F} \cdot d\mathbf {r} =\int _{t_{0}}^{t_{1}}\mathbf {F} \cdot {\frac {d\mathbf {r} }{dt}}~dt=\int _{t_{0}}^{t_{1}}\mathbf {F} \cdot \mathbf {v} ~dt,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4f6ed3e0b1aa309e006f524db6173c452cd9454c) where _d_**r** is the differential element along the curve that is the trajectory of _P_, and **v** is its velocity. It is important to notice that the value of the work _W_ depends on the trajectory **r**(_t_).

Now consider particle _P_ that moves from point _A_ to point _B_ again, but this time it moves along the nearby trajectory that differs from **r**(_t_) by the variation _δ_**r**(_t_) = _ε_**h**(_t_), where _ε_ is a scaling constant that can be made as small as desired and **h**(_t_) is an arbitrary function that satisfies **h**(_t_ 0) = **h**(_t_ 1) = 0. Suppose the force **F**(**r**(_t_) + _ε_**h**(_t_)) is the same as **F**(**r**(_t_)). The work done by the force is given by the integral ![Image 24: {\displaystyle {\bar {W}}=\int _{\mathbf {r} (t_{0})=A}^{\mathbf {r} (t_{1})=B}\mathbf {F} \cdot d(\mathbf {r} +\varepsilon \mathbf {h} )=\int _{t_{0}}^{t_{1}}\mathbf {F} \cdot {\frac {d(\mathbf {r} (t)+\varepsilon \mathbf {h} (t))}{dt}}~dt=\int _{t_{0}}^{t_{1}}\mathbf {F} \cdot (\mathbf {v} +\varepsilon {\dot {\mathbf {h} }})~dt.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8ce83863446bae049e60b7fabd228e7ad98bd9de) The variation of the work _δW_ associated with this nearby path, known as the _virtual work_, can be computed to be ![Image 25: {\displaystyle \delta W={\bar {W}}-W=\int _{t_{0}}^{t_{1}}(\mathbf {F} \cdot \varepsilon {\dot {\mathbf {h} }})~dt.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7b1324a41b195927aea005a3bbb3e276af879ed7)

If there are no constraints on the motion of _P_, then 3 parameters are needed to completely describe _P_'s position at any time _t_. If there are _k_ (_k_ ≤ 3) constraint forces, then _n_ = (3 − _k_) parameters are needed. Hence, we can define _n_ generalized coordinates _q_ _i_ (_t_) (_i_ = 1,...,_n_), and express **r**(_t_) and _δ_**r** = _ε_**h**(_t_) in terms of the generalized coordinates. That is, ![Image 26: {\displaystyle \mathbf {r} (t)=\mathbf {r} (q_{1},q_{2},\dots ,q_{n};t),}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4368ed4762ebc1fbbe782c2a6fda61a5850a481a)![Image 27: {\displaystyle \mathbf {h} (t)=\mathbf {h} (q_{1},q_{2},\dots ,q_{n};t).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b2ecce421a729339f916e8334d9530c76a5495d3) Then, the derivative of the variation _δ_**r** = _ε_**h**(_t_) is given by ![Image 28: {\displaystyle {\frac {d}{dt}}\delta \mathbf {r} ={\frac {d}{dt}}\varepsilon \mathbf {h} =\sum _{i=1}^{n}{\frac {\partial \mathbf {h} }{\partial q_{i}}}\varepsilon {\dot {q}}_{i},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9d669eff145eb77f13bb358dbc15de50f3ea3666) then we have ![Image 29: {\displaystyle \delta W=\int _{t_{0}}^{t_{1}}\left(\sum _{i=1}^{n}\mathbf {F} \cdot {\frac {\partial \mathbf {h} }{\partial q_{i}}}\varepsilon {\dot {q}}_{i}\right)dt=\sum _{i=1}^{n}\left(\int _{t_{0}}^{t_{1}}\mathbf {F} \cdot {\frac {\partial \mathbf {h} }{\partial q_{i}}}\varepsilon {\dot {q}}_{i}~dt\right).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8fe5eb798911ac1e7008feef532959bf632429ef)

The requirement that the virtual work be zero for an arbitrary variation _δ_**r**(_t_) = _ε_**h**(_t_) is equivalent to the set of requirements ![Image 30: {\displaystyle Q_{i}=\mathbf {F} \cdot {\frac {\partial \mathbf {h} }{\partial q_{i}}}=0,\quad i=1,\ldots ,n.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b8449af10e4ebe92400fc105e86c3c8995dbb1fa) The terms _Q i_ are called the _generalized forces_ associated with the virtual displacement _δ_**r**.

[Static equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_equilibrium "Mechanical equilibrium") is a state in which the net force and net torque acted upon the system is zero. In other words, both [linear momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum "Momentum") and [angular momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_momentum "Angular momentum") of the system are conserved. The principle of virtual work states that _the virtual work of the applied forces is zero for all [virtual movements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual\_displacement "Virtual displacement") of the system from [static equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical\_equilibrium "Mechanical equilibrium")_. This principle can be generalized such that three dimensional [rotations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation "Rotation") are included: the virtual work of the applied forces and applied moments is zero for all [virtual movements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_displacement "Virtual displacement") of the system from static equilibrium. That is ![Image 31: {\displaystyle \delta W=\sum _{i=1}^{m}\mathbf {F} _{i}\cdot \delta \mathbf {r} _{i}+\sum _{j=1}^{n}\mathbf {M} _{j}\cdot \delta \mathbf {\varphi } _{j}=0,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/77d9a951f05592cec4075a8da102cecb4910dbdd) where **F**_i_ , _i_ = 1, 2, ..., _m_ and **M**_j_ , _j_ = 1, 2, ..., _n_ are the applied forces and applied moments, respectively, and _δ_**r**_i_ , _i_ = 1, 2, ..., _m_ and _δ**φ**j_, _j_ = 1, 2, ..., _n_ are the [virtual displacements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_displacement "Virtual displacement") and [virtual rotations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_displacement "Virtual displacement"), respectively.

Suppose the system consists of _N_ particles, and it has _f_ (_f_ ≤ 6 _N_) [degrees of freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrees_of_freedom_(mechanics) "Degrees of freedom (mechanics)"). It is sufficient to use only _f_ coordinates to give a complete description of the motion of the system, so _f_[generalized coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_coordinates "Generalized coordinates")_q k_ , _k_ = 1, 2, ..., _f_ are defined such that the [virtual movements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_displacement "Virtual displacement") can be expressed in terms of these [generalized coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_coordinates "Generalized coordinates"). That is, ![Image 32: {\displaystyle \delta \mathbf {r} _{i}(q_{1},q_{2},\dots ,q_{f};t),\quad i=1,2,\dots ,m;}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d6724327ca9537b0b5324805c195056601c45d51)![Image 33: {\displaystyle \delta \phi _{j}(q_{1},q_{2},\dots ,q_{f};t),\quad j=1,2,\dots ,n.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fdaa76d1dee4b9a82ba640ac011859aef60318f0)

The virtual work can then be [reparametrized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametrization_(geometry) "Parametrization (geometry)") by the [generalized coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_coordinates "Generalized coordinates"): ![Image 34: {\displaystyle \delta W=\sum _{k=1}^{f}\left[\left(\sum _{i=1}^{m}\mathbf {F} _{i}\cdot {\frac {\partial \mathbf {r} _{i}}{\partial q_{k}}}+\sum _{j=1}^{n}\mathbf {M} _{j}\cdot {\frac {\partial \mathbf {\phi } _{j}}{\partial q_{k}}}\right)\delta q_{k}\right]=\sum _{k=1}^{f}Q_{k}\delta q_{k},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d0cd60c4c9c6921560a96631a730172280957d62) where the [generalized forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_forces "Generalized forces")_Q k_ are defined as ![Image 35: {\displaystyle Q_{k}=\sum _{i=1}^{m}\mathbf {F} _{i}\cdot {\frac {\partial \mathbf {r} _{i}}{\partial q_{k}}}+\sum _{j=1}^{n}\mathbf {M} _{j}\cdot {\frac {\partial \mathbf {\phi } _{j}}{\partial q_{k}}},\quad k=1,2,\dots ,f.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d517a95b7cb1c7781b74223bbdf5969c46206793) Kane[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_work#cite_note-5) shows that these [generalized forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_forces "Generalized forces") can also be formulated in terms of the ratio of time derivatives. That is, ![Image 36: {\displaystyle Q_{k}=\sum _{i=1}^{m}\mathbf {F} _{i}\cdot {\frac {\partial \mathbf {v} _{i}}{\partial {\dot {q}}_{k}}}+\sum _{j=1}^{n}\mathbf {M} _{j}\cdot {\frac {\partial \mathbf {\omega } _{j}}{\partial {\dot {q}}_{k}}},\quad k=1,2,\dots ,f.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c9b2c1df84e9a005cd92c54a227719582908b156)

The principle of virtual work requires that the virtual work done on a system by the forces **F**_i_ and moments **M**_j_ vanishes if it is in [equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_equilibrium "Mechanical equilibrium"). Therefore, the generalized forces _Q_ _k_ are zero, that is ![Image 37: {\displaystyle \delta W=0\quad \Rightarrow \quad Q_{k}=0\quad k=1,2,\dots ,f.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/78216da022f25a910e10bacc2f802a7c10738699)

An important benefit of the principle of virtual work is that only forces that do work as the system moves through a [virtual displacement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_displacement "Virtual displacement") are needed to determine the mechanics of the system. There are many forces in a mechanical system that do no work during a [virtual displacement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_displacement "Virtual displacement"), which means that they need not be considered in this analysis. The two important examples are (i) the internal forces in a [rigid body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigid_body "Rigid body"), and (ii) the constraint forces at an ideal [joint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinematic_pair "Kinematic pair").

Lanczos[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_work#cite_note-Lanczos-1) presents this as the postulate: "The virtual work of the forces of reaction is always zero for any [virtual displacement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_displacement "Virtual displacement") which is in harmony with the given kinematic constraints." The argument is as follows. The principle of virtual work states that in [equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_equilibrium "Mechanical equilibrium") the virtual work of the forces applied to a system is zero. [Newton's laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion "Newton's laws of motion") state that at [equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_equilibrium "Mechanical equilibrium") the applied forces are equal and opposite to the reaction, or constraint forces. This means the virtual work of the constraint forces must be zero as well.

A [lever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lever "Lever") is modeled as a rigid bar connected to a ground frame by a hinged joint called a fulcrum. The lever is operated by applying an input force **F**_A_ at a point _A_ located by the coordinate vector **r**_A_ on the bar. The lever then exerts an output force **F**_B_ at the point _B_ located by **r**_B_. The rotation of the lever about the fulcrum _P_ is defined by the rotation angle _θ_.

[![Image 38](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Archimedes_lever_%28Small%29.jpg/330px-Archimedes_lever_%28Small%29.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Archimedes_lever_(Small).jpg)

This is an engraving from _Mechanics Magazine_ published in London in 1824.

Let the coordinate vector of the point _P_ that defines the fulcrum be **r**_P_, and introduce the lengths ![Image 39: {\displaystyle a=|\mathbf {r} _{A}-\mathbf {r} _{P}|,\quad b=|\mathbf {r} _{B}-\mathbf {r} _{P}|,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a2bc0ad7632446bfdb4a9b80e454422e5b266c8e) which are the distances from the fulcrum to the input point _A_ and to the output point _B_, respectively.

Now introduce the unit vectors **e**_A_ and **e**_B_ from the fulcrum to the point _A_ and _B_, so ![Image 40: {\displaystyle \mathbf {r} _{A}-\mathbf {r} _{P}=a\mathbf {e} _{A},\quad \mathbf {r} _{B}-\mathbf {r} _{P}=b\mathbf {e} _{B}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a1d38f48dbfe59125b440a4aa8f1739c5a828f54) This notation allows us to define the velocity of the points _A_ and _B_ as ![Image 41: {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} _{A}={\dot {\theta }}a\mathbf {e} _{A}^{\perp },\quad \mathbf {v} _{B}={\dot {\theta }}b\mathbf {e} _{B}^{\perp },}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/67e232b1ecbab63ceb34a59bd476eb192f971e0f) where **e**_A_⊥ and **e**_B_⊥ are unit vectors perpendicular to **e**_A_ and **e**_B_, respectively.

The angle _θ_ is the generalized coordinate that defines the configuration of the lever, therefore using the formula above for forces applied to a one degree-of-freedom mechanism, the generalized force is given by ![Image 42: {\displaystyle Q=\mathbf {F} _{A}\cdot {\frac {\partial \mathbf {v} _{A}}{\partial {\dot {\theta }}}}-\mathbf {F} _{B}\cdot {\frac {\partial \mathbf {v} _{B}}{\partial {\dot {\theta }}}}=a(\mathbf {F} _{A}\cdot \mathbf {e} _{A}^{\perp })-b(\mathbf {F} _{B}\cdot \mathbf {e} _{B}^{\perp }).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4f01f4d4dc42da5941493b8ffe0a56d50d39cb99)

Now, denote as _F_ _A_ and _F_ _B_ the components of the forces that are perpendicular to the radial segments _PA_ and _PB_. These forces are given by ![Image 43: {\displaystyle F_{A}=\mathbf {F} _{A}\cdot \mathbf {e} _{A}^{\perp },\quad F_{B}=\mathbf {F} _{B}\cdot \mathbf {e} _{B}^{\perp }.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/faee406338759ab59f58d7f2b7fcdccae15872d1) This notation and the principle of virtual work yield the formula for the generalized force as ![Image 44: {\displaystyle Q=aF_{A}-bF_{B}=0.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/dc52b9401cc1fad00f4f3bb9f6790fa8ca750a0f)

The ratio of the output force _F_ _B_ to the input force _F_ _A_ is the [mechanical advantage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_advantage "Mechanical advantage") of the lever, and is obtained from the principle of virtual work as ![Image 45: {\displaystyle MA={\frac {F_{B}}{F_{A}}}={\frac {a}{b}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e4516522ccaaa831010fc757760110894929d202)

This equation shows that if the distance _a_ from the fulcrum to the point _A_ where the input force is applied is greater than the distance _b_ from fulcrum to the point _B_ where the output force is applied, then the lever amplifies the input force. If the opposite is true that the distance from the fulcrum to the input point _A_ is less than from the fulcrum to the output point _B_, then the lever reduces the magnitude of the input force.

This is the _law of the lever_, which was proven by [Archimedes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes "Archimedes") using geometric reasoning.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_work#cite_note-Usher1954-6)

A gear train is formed by mounting gears on a frame so that the teeth of the gears engage. Gear teeth are designed to ensure the pitch circles of engaging gears roll on each other without slipping, this provides a smooth transmission of rotation from one gear to the next. For this analysis, we consider a gear train that has one degree-of-freedom, which means the angular rotation of all the gears in the gear train are defined by the angle of the input gear.

[![Image 46](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8f/Transmission_of_motion_by_compund_gear_train_%28Army_Service_Corps_Training%2C_Mechanical_Transport%2C_1911%29.jpg/330px-Transmission_of_motion_by_compund_gear_train_%28Army_Service_Corps_Training%2C_Mechanical_Transport%2C_1911%29.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Transmission_of_motion_by_compund_gear_train_(Army_Service_Corps_Training,_Mechanical_Transport,_1911).jpg)

Illustration from Army Service Corps Training on Mechanical Transport, (1911), Fig. 112 Transmission of motion and force by gear wheels, compound train

The size of the gears and the sequence in which they engage define the ratio of the angular velocity _ω A_ of the input gear to the angular velocity _ω B_ of the output gear, known as the speed ratio, or [gear ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gear_ratio "Gear ratio"), of the gear train. Let _R_ be the speed ratio, then ![Image 47: {\displaystyle {\frac {\omega _{A}}{\omega _{B}}}=R.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/54d17594026a5f0ebe7b28dd5fcffdaa5a8dc7a4)

The input torque _T_ _A_ acting on the input gear _G_ _A_ is transformed by the gear train into the output torque _T_ _B_ exerted by the output gear _G_ _B_. If we assume, that the gears are rigid and that there are no losses in the engagement of the gear teeth, then the principle of virtual work can be used to analyze the static equilibrium of the gear train.

Let the angle _θ_ of the input gear be the generalized coordinate of the gear train, then the speed ratio _R_ of the gear train defines the angular velocity of the output gear in terms of the input gear, that is ![Image 48: {\displaystyle \omega _{A}=\omega ,\quad \omega _{B}=\omega /R.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f8cb159b7bad253b998d586982f342e26bdf639e)

The formula above for the principle of virtual work with applied torques yields the generalized force ![Image 49: {\displaystyle Q=T_{A}{\frac {\partial \omega _{A}}{\partial \omega }}-T_{B}{\frac {\partial \omega _{B}}{\partial \omega }}=T_{A}-T_{B}/R=0.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/283e6bc99d6c33dc3abd7cd77168fc495e3c5826)

The [mechanical advantage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_advantage "Mechanical advantage") of the gear train is the ratio of the output torque _T_ _B_ to the input torque _T_ _A_, and the above equation yields ![Image 50: {\displaystyle MA={\frac {T_{B}}{T_{A}}}=R.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e72dd4cd777a1ebc2a23b924f1cb2363131a7c08)

Thus, the speed ratio of a gear train also defines its mechanical advantage. This shows that if the input gear rotates faster than the output gear, then the gear train amplifies the input torque. And, if the input gear rotates slower than the output gear, then the gear train reduces the input torque.

Dynamic equilibrium for rigid bodies
------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Virtual_work&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Dynamic equilibrium for rigid bodies")]

If the principle of virtual work for applied forces is used on individual particles of a [rigid body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigid_body "Rigid body"), the principle can be generalized for a rigid body: _When a rigid body that is in equilibrium is subject to virtual compatible displacements, the total virtual work of all external forces is zero; and conversely, if the total virtual work of all external forces acting on a rigid body is zero then the body is in equilibrium_.

If a system is not in static equilibrium, D'Alembert showed that by introducing the acceleration terms of Newton's laws as inertia forces, this approach is generalized to define dynamic equilibrium. The result is D'Alembert's form of the principle of virtual work, which is used to derive the equations of motion for a mechanical system of rigid bodies.

The expression _compatible displacements_ means that the particles remain in contact and displace together so that the work done by pairs of action/reaction inter-particle forces cancel out. Various forms of this principle have been credited to [Johann (Jean) Bernoulli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Bernoulli "Johann Bernoulli") (1667–1748) and [Daniel Bernoulli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Bernoulli "Daniel Bernoulli") (1700–1782).

### Generalized inertia forces

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Virtual_work&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Generalized inertia forces")]

Let a mechanical system be constructed from n rigid bodies, B i, i=1,...,n, and let the resultant of the applied forces on each body be the force-torque pairs, **F**i and **T**i, _i_ = 1,...,_n_. Notice that these applied forces do not include the reaction forces where the bodies are connected. Finally, assume that the velocity **V**i and angular velocities **ω**i, _i_=1,...,_n_, for each rigid body, are defined by a single generalized coordinate q. Such a system of rigid bodies is said to have one [degree of freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_of_freedom_(mechanics) "Degree of freedom (mechanics)").

Consider a single rigid body which moves under the action of a resultant force **F** and torque **T**, with one degree of freedom defined by the generalized coordinate q. Assume the reference point for the resultant force and torque is the center of mass of the body, then the generalized inertia force Q* associated with the generalized coordinate q is given by ![Image 51: {\displaystyle Q^{*}=-(M\mathbf {A} )\cdot {\frac {\partial \mathbf {V} }{\partial {\dot {q}}}}-([I_{R}]\alpha +\omega \times [I_{R}]\omega )\cdot {\frac {\partial {\boldsymbol {\omega }}}{\partial {\dot {q}}}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/25089ea7b3a2a88186ff4d1d72f337d170e35376) This inertia force can be computed from the kinetic energy of the rigid body, ![Image 52: {\displaystyle T={\frac {1}{2}}M\mathbf {V} \cdot \mathbf {V} +{\frac {1}{2}}{\boldsymbol {\omega }}\cdot [I_{R}]{\boldsymbol {\omega }},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/918b678cc8c65f480ff35ddb93888ae75ad23dbe) by using the formula ![Image 53: {\displaystyle Q^{*}=-\left({\frac {d}{dt}}{\frac {\partial T}{\partial {\dot {q}}}}-{\frac {\partial T}{\partial q}}\right).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5011d97e0cbee68fa732ce8991a61549118888e0)

A system of n rigid bodies with m generalized coordinates has the kinetic energy ![Image 54: {\displaystyle T=\sum _{i=1}^{n}\left({\frac {1}{2}}M\mathbf {V} _{i}\cdot \mathbf {V} _{i}+{\frac {1}{2}}{\boldsymbol {\omega }}_{i}\cdot [I_{R}]{\boldsymbol {\omega }}_{i}\right),}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8e5642041e1ddc2551edbbbf8c44359ae6f874bf) which can be used to calculate the m generalized inertia forces[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_work#cite_note-7)![Image 55: {\displaystyle Q_{j}^{*}=-\left({\frac {d}{dt}}{\frac {\partial T}{\partial {\dot {q}}_{j}}}-{\frac {\partial T}{\partial q_{j}}}\right),\quad j=1,\ldots ,m.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/52f16308afd5d1ea4567b0e47ebb0ee3f37b1a1a)

### D'Alembert's form of the principle of virtual work

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Virtual_work&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: D'Alembert's form of the principle of virtual work")]

D'Alembert's form of the principle of virtual work states that a system of rigid bodies is in dynamic equilibrium when the virtual work of the sum of the applied forces and the inertial forces is zero for any virtual displacement of the system. Thus, dynamic equilibrium of a system of n rigid bodies with m generalized coordinates requires that ![Image 56: {\displaystyle \delta W=(Q_{1}+Q_{1}^{*})\delta q_{1}+\dots +(Q_{m}+Q_{m}^{*})\delta q_{m}=0,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a990579c9f1a078c40aa90e24e28646f237e5f70) for any set of virtual displacements _δq j_. This condition yields _m_ equations, ![Image 57: {\displaystyle Q_{j}+Q_{j}^{*}=0,\quad j=1,\ldots ,m,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/abdc1026adbba50c42e5d87d85441336a6f2d9f4) which can also be written as ![Image 58: {\displaystyle {\frac {d}{dt}}{\frac {\partial T}{\partial {\dot {q}}_{j}}}-{\frac {\partial T}{\partial q_{j}}}=Q_{j},\quad j=1,\ldots ,m.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/588bfb13eedb4ccb044296df1df54a9a409cfb53) The result is a set of m equations of motion that define the dynamics of the rigid body system, known as [Lagrange's equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_mechanics "Lagrangian mechanics") or the **generalized equations of motion**.

If the generalized forces Q j are derivable from a potential energy _V_(_q_ 1,...,_q_ _m_), then these equations of motion take the form ![Image 59: {\displaystyle {\frac {d}{dt}}{\frac {\partial T}{\partial {\dot {q}}_{j}}}-{\frac {\partial T}{\partial q_{j}}}=-{\frac {\partial V}{\partial q_{j}}},\quad j=1,\ldots ,m.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7cd686304a9c80e9af12e8f88db50df653ab7906)

In this case, introduce the [Lagrangian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_mechanics "Lagrangian mechanics"), _L_ = _T_ − _V_, so these equations of motion become ![Image 60: {\displaystyle {\frac {d}{dt}}{\frac {\partial L}{\partial {\dot {q}}_{j}}}-{\frac {\partial L}{\partial q_{j}}}=0\quad j=1,\ldots ,m.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b21b186aa6c6042e89c4f950413bac44a96000b1) These are known as the [Euler-Lagrange equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%E2%80%93Lagrange_equation "Euler–Lagrange equation") for a system with m degrees of freedom, or **Lagrange's equations of the second kind**.

Virtual work principle for a deformable body
--------------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Virtual_work&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Virtual work principle for a deformable body")]

Consider now the [free body diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_body_diagram "Free body diagram") of a [deformable body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformable_body "Deformable body"), which is composed of an infinite number of differential cubes. Let's define two unrelated states for the body:

The superscript * emphasizes that the two states are unrelated. Other than the above stated conditions, there is no need to specify if any of the states are real or virtual.

Imagine now that the forces and stresses in the ![Image 61: {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\sigma }}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e45fe1b9d8dcbc3103fc7805d69798bfe5ca5b16)-State undergo the [displacements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_(vector) "Displacement (vector)") and [deformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformation_(engineering) "Deformation (engineering)") in the ![Image 62: {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\epsilon }}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/be3ff7747cde11092061b1cf99a03eb19bfeba31)-State: We can compute the total virtual (imaginary) work done by _**all forces acting on the faces of all cubes**_ in two different ways:

Equating the two results leads to the principle of virtual work for a deformable body:

![Image 63: {\displaystyle {\text{Total external virtual work}}=\int _{V}{\boldsymbol {\epsilon }}^{*T}{\boldsymbol {\sigma }}dV}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2d8a47237da6e91b902b1af7c31b9512f584ab67)d

where the total external virtual work is done by **T** and **f**. Thus,

![Image 64: {\displaystyle \int _{S}\mathbf {u} ^{*T}\mathbf {T} dS+\int _{V}\mathbf {u} ^{*T}\mathbf {f} dV=\int _{V}{\boldsymbol {\epsilon }}^{*T}{\boldsymbol {\sigma }}dV}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5efb4893fba6e6533f55bd9eb46ae684aed7961e)e

The right-hand-side of (**[d](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_work#math_d)**,**[e](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_work#math_e)**) is often called the internal virtual work. The principle of virtual work then states: _External virtual work is equal to internal virtual work when equilibrated forces and stresses undergo unrelated but consistent displacements and strains_. It includes the principle of virtual work for rigid bodies as a special case where the internal virtual work is zero.

### Proof of equivalence between the principle of virtual work and the equilibrium equation

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Virtual_work&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Proof of equivalence between the principle of virtual work and the equilibrium equation")]

We start by looking at the total work done by surface traction on the body going through the specified deformation: ![Image 65: {\displaystyle \int _{S}\mathbf {u} \cdot \mathbf {T} dS=\int _{S}\mathbf {u} \cdot {\boldsymbol {\sigma }}\cdot \mathbf {n} dS}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ed18478f857f2eda9821a63b02702993b084583c)

Applying divergence theorem to the right hand side yields: ![Image 66: {\displaystyle \int _{S}\mathbf {u\cdot {\boldsymbol {\sigma }}\cdot n} dS=\int _{V}\nabla \cdot \left(\mathbf {u} \cdot {\boldsymbol {\sigma }}\right)dV}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/cfefada2b2e92c01433c3920cc4be411f27efeca)

Now switch to indicial notation for the ease of derivation. ![Image 67: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\int _{V}\nabla \cdot \left(\mathbf {u} \cdot {\boldsymbol {\sigma }}\right)dV&=\int _{V}{\frac {\partial }{\partial x_{j}}}\left(u_{i}\sigma _{ij}\right)dV\\&=\int _{V}\left({\frac {\partial u_{i}}{\partial x_{j}}}\sigma _{ij}+u_{i}{\frac {\partial \sigma _{ij}}{\partial x_{j}}}\right)dV\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3d4f0b18c2efe85ef28a938b00e52bbb106d30ec)

To continue our derivation, we substitute in the equilibrium equation ![Image 68: {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial \sigma _{ij}}{\partial x_{j}}}+f_{i}=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/edbe3faa96d33fc2cfd09846607f405fbbd2600c). Then ![Image 69: {\displaystyle \int _{V}\left({\frac {\partial u_{i}}{\partial x_{j}}}\sigma _{ij}+u_{i}{\frac {\partial \sigma _{ij}}{\partial x_{j}}}\right)dV=\int _{V}\left({\frac {\partial u_{i}}{\partial x_{j}}}\sigma _{ij}-u_{i}f_{i}\right)dV}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6edc142c95336393830e871a304b5f791c46a9a5)

The first term on the right hand side needs to be broken into a symmetric part and a skew part as follows: ![Image 70: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\int _{V}\left({\frac {\partial u_{i}}{\partial x_{j}}}\sigma _{ij}-u_{i}f_{i}\right)dV&=\int _{V}\left({\frac {1}{2}}\left[\left({\frac {\partial u_{i}}{\partial x_{j}}}+{\frac {\partial u_{j}}{\partial x_{i}}}\right)+\left({\frac {\partial u_{i}}{\partial x_{j}}}-{\frac {\partial u_{j}}{\partial x_{i}}}\right)\right]\sigma _{ij}-u_{i}f_{i}\right)dV\\&=\int _{V}\left(\left[\epsilon _{ij}+{\frac {1}{2}}\left({\frac {\partial u_{i}}{\partial x_{j}}}-{\frac {\partial u_{j}}{\partial x_{i}}}\right)\right]\sigma _{ij}-u_{i}f_{i}\right)dV\\&=\int _{V}\left(\epsilon _{ij}\sigma _{ij}-u_{i}f_{i}\right)dV\\&=\int _{V}\left({\boldsymbol {\epsilon }}:{\boldsymbol {\sigma }}-\mathbf {u} \cdot \mathbf {f} \right)dV\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d59278223ee684a75f9b8effd8329bfbe024ee6b) where ![Image 71: {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\epsilon }}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/be3ff7747cde11092061b1cf99a03eb19bfeba31) is the strain that is consistent with the specified displacement field. The 2nd to last equality comes from the fact that the stress matrix is symmetric and that the product of a skew matrix and a symmetric matrix is zero.

Now recap. We have shown through the above derivation that ![Image 72: {\displaystyle \int _{S}\mathbf {u\cdot T} dS=\int _{V}{\boldsymbol {\epsilon }}:{\boldsymbol {\sigma }}dV-\int _{V}\mathbf {u} \cdot \mathbf {f} dV}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/252ab1dbcb8c9c0d9a957f8eb4023874a9a26af9)

Move the 2nd term on the right hand side of the equation to the left: ![Image 73: {\displaystyle \int _{S}\mathbf {u\cdot T} dS+\int _{V}\mathbf {u} \cdot \mathbf {f} dV=\int _{V}{\boldsymbol {\epsilon }}:{\boldsymbol {\sigma }}dV}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bc422542991347e57e964b39b2870305b0cded5f)

The physical interpretation of the above equation is, _the External virtual work is equal to internal virtual work when equilibrated forces and stresses undergo unrelated but consistent displacements and strains_.

For practical applications:

*   In order to impose equilibrium on real stresses and forces, we use consistent virtual displacements and strains in the virtual work equation.
*   In order to impose consistent displacements and strains, we use equilibriated virtual stresses and forces in the virtual work equation.

These two general scenarios give rise to two often stated variational principles. They are valid irrespective of material behaviour.

### Principle of virtual displacements

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Virtual_work&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Principle of virtual displacements")]

Depending on the purpose, we may specialize the virtual work equation. For example, to derive the principle of virtual displacements in variational notations for supported bodies, we specify:

The virtual work equation then becomes the principle of virtual displacements:

![Image 74: {\displaystyle \int _{S_{t}}\delta \ \mathbf {u} ^{T}\mathbf {T} dS+\int _{V}\delta \ \mathbf {u} ^{T}\mathbf {f} dV=\int _{V}\delta {\boldsymbol {\epsilon }}^{T}{\boldsymbol {\sigma }}dV}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/500047a4b4adc486f123f67aee95a172c1fc3bfc)f

This relation is equivalent to the set of equilibrium equations written for a differential element in the deformable body as well as of the stress boundary conditions on the part ![Image 75: {\displaystyle S_{t}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7e2391e6e796fbf718be3828080775ac2ac3d3d4) of the surface. Conversely, (**[f](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_work#math_f)**) can be reached, albeit in a non-trivial manner, by starting with the differential equilibrium equations and the stress boundary conditions on ![Image 76: {\displaystyle S_{t}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7e2391e6e796fbf718be3828080775ac2ac3d3d4), and proceeding in the manner similar to (**[a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_work#math_a)**) and (**[b](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_work#math_b)**).

Since virtual displacements are automatically compatible when they are expressed in terms of [continuous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function "Continuous function"), [single-valued functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-valued_function "Single-valued function"), we often mention only the need for consistency between strains and displacements. The virtual work principle is also valid for large real displacements; however, Eq.(**[f](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_work#math_f)**) would then be written using more complex measures of stresses and strains.

### Principle of virtual forces

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Virtual_work&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Principle of virtual forces")]

Here, we specify:

The virtual work equation becomes the principle of virtual forces:

![Image 77: {\displaystyle \int _{S_{u}}\mathbf {u} ^{T}\delta \ \mathbf {T} dS+\int _{V}\mathbf {u} ^{T}\delta \ \mathbf {f} dV=\int _{V}{\boldsymbol {\epsilon }}^{T}\delta {\boldsymbol {\sigma }}dV}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9ee2011bec288a8895449a868a948e3b4c4f7a8b)g

This relation is equivalent to the set of strain-compatibility equations as well as of the displacement boundary conditions on the part ![Image 78: {\displaystyle S_{u}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/67c9f918cd7ca182409d49b7af0683225fcb9bf2). It has another name: the principle of complementary virtual work.

A specialization of the principle of virtual forces is the [unit dummy force method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_dummy_force_method "Unit dummy force method"), which is very useful for computing displacements in structural systems. According to [D'Alembert's principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%27Alembert%27s_principle "D'Alembert's principle"), inclusion of inertial forces as additional body forces will give the virtual work equation applicable to dynamical systems. More generalized principles can be derived by:

*   allowing variations of all quantities.
*   using [Lagrange multipliers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_multipliers "Lagrange multipliers") to impose boundary conditions and/or to relax the conditions specified in the two states.

These are described in some of the references.

Among the many [energy principles in structural mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_principles_in_structural_mechanics "Energy principles in structural mechanics"), the virtual work principle deserves a special place due to its generality that leads to powerful applications in [structural analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_analysis "Structural analysis"), [solid mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_mechanics "Solid mechanics"), and [finite element method in structural mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_element_method_in_structural_mechanics "Finite element method in structural mechanics").
