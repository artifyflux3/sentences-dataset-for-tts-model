[ 3 ] 1 phyeam = 2 muoi = 2 m 1 sen = 20 phyeam = 40 muoi = 40 m 1 yoch = 400 sen = 16,000 muoi = 16 km Cham am [ edit ] The cham am is a unit of length, used during the 18th–20th century in Cambodia.

[ 4 ] It is equivalent to 12 thneap or 25 centimetres (9.8 in).

[ 5 ] Thneap [ edit ] The thneap is a unit of length, used during 18th – 20th century in Cambodia.

[ 3 ] Some other units are given below: [ 3 ] 1 lin = 3 ⁄ 80 muoi = 22.5 g 1 hun = 10 lin = 3 ⁄ 8 muoi = 225 g 1 chin = 10 hun = 3 + 3 ⁄ 4 muoi = 2.25 kg 1 tael = 10 chin = 37 + 1 ⁄ 2 muoi = 22.5 kg 1 neal = 16 tael = 360 kg 1 pram roi (not can tay) = 1000 muoi = 600 kg 1 chong = 50 neal = 30,000 muoi = 18 t 1 hap (picul) = 20 chong = 600,000 muoi = 360 t Capacity [ edit ] Several units were used to measure capacity.  One sesep (vuong mot gia) was equal to 40 litres.

[ 3 ] Some other units are given below: [ 3 ] 1 muoi (vuong mot ba tay) = 1 ⁄ 40 sesep = 1 L 1 kantang = 3 ⁄ 16 sesep = 7.5 L 1 tao = 2 kantang = 3 ⁄ 8 sesep = 15 L 1 thang = 2 tao = 3 ⁄ 4 sesep = 30 L Metric system [ edit ] Length [ edit ] Metric system has been compulsory with the name muoi mètre for meter.
