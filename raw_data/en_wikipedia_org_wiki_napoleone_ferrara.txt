[ 1 ] At Genentech, he discovered VEGF —and made the first anti-VEGF antibody—which suppresses growth of a variety of tumors. These findings helped lead to development of the first clinically available angiogenesis inhibitor , bevacizumab (Avastin), which prevents the growth of new blood vessels into a solid tumor and which has become part of standard treatment for a variety of cancers.

[ citation needed ] Ferrara's work led also to the development of ranibizumab ( Lucentis ), a drug that is highly effective at preventing vision loss in intraocular neovascular disorders.

[ citation needed ] Education [ edit ] Ferrara received his medical degree from the University of Catania , Italy, in 1981, and joined Genentech in 1988. He did his postdoctoral research at University of California, San Francisco .

[ 2 ] Current research [ edit ] At UC San Diego Moores Cancer Center , Ferrara, a member of the National Academy of Sciences since 2006, serves as Senior Deputy Director for Basic Science and is a Distinguished Professor of Pathology in the UC San Diego School of Medicine , where he will continue cancer drug research targeting angiogenesis.

[ citation needed ] He is presently focusing on investigating mechanisms of tumor angiogenesis alternative to VEGF, in particular the role of factors produced by myeloid cells and fibroblasts in mediating resistance to VEGF inhibitors.

[ citation needed ] Selected honors and awards [ edit ] For his VEGF discovery, he won a Lasker Award in 2010.

[ 3 ] In 2013, he was awarded the $3 million Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences for his work.

[ 4 ] He has received numerous other awards, including the General Motors Cancer Research Award (2006), the ASCO Science of Oncology Award (2007), the Pezcoller Foundation/AACR International Award (2009), the Dr. Paul Janssen Award for Biomedical Research (2011), and The Economist 's Innovation Award for bioscience in 2012.

[ citation needed ] Grand Prix scientifique de la Fondation Lefoulon-Delalande in 2005.

[ 5 ] In September 2014, Ferrara was awarded the António Champalimaud Vision Award, awarded by the Champalimaud Foundation .
