[ 1 ] It states that the sequence of bases in the genetic material ( DNA or RNA ) determines the sequence of amino acids for which that segment of nucleic acid codes, and this amino acid sequence determines the three-dimensional structure into which the protein folds. The three-dimensional structure of a protein is required for a protein to be functional. This hypothesis then lays the essential link between information stored and inherited in nucleic acids to the chemical processes which enable life to exist.

[ 2 ] Or, as Crick put it in 1958: In its simplest form it [the Sequence Hypothesis] assumes that the specificity of a piece of nucleic acid is expressed solely by the sequence of its bases , and that this sequence is a (simple) code for the amino acid sequence of a particular protein.
This hypothesis appears to be rather widely held. Its virtue is that it unites several remarkable pairs of generalisations: the central biochemical importance of proteins and the dominating role of genes , and in particular of their nucleic acid; the linearity of protein molecules (considered covalently) and the genetic linearity within the functional gene [...]; the simplicity of the composition of protein molecules and the simplicity of the nucleic acids.

— [ 1 ] : 152 This description is further amplified in the article and, in discussing how a protein folds up into its three-dimensional structure, Crick suggested that "the folding is simply a function of the order of the amino acids " in the protein.
