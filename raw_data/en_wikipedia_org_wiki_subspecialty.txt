A subspecialist is a specialist of a subspecialty.

In medicine , subspecialization is particularly common in internal medicine , cardiology , neurology and pathology , psychiatry and has grown as medical practice has: become more complex, and it has become clear that a physician 's case volume is negatively associated with their complication rate; that is, complications tend to decrease as the volume of cases per physician goes up.
