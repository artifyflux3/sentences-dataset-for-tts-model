In the system of Greek numerals , it has a value of four. It was derived from the Phoenician letter dalet 𐤃.

[ 3 ] Letters that come from delta include the Latin D and the Cyrillic Д .

A river delta (originally, the delta of the Nile River ) is named so because its shape approximates the triangular uppercase letter delta. Contrary to a popular legend, [ vague ] this use of the word delta was not coined by Herodotus .

[ 4 ] Pronunciation [ edit ] In Ancient Greek , delta represented a voiced dental plosive IPA: [d] . In Modern Greek , it represents a voiced dental fricative IPA: [ð] , like the " th " in " that " or " this " (while IPA: [d] in foreign words is instead commonly transcribed as ντ). Delta is romanized as d or dh .

Uppercase [ edit ] The uppercase letter Δ is used to denote: Change of any changeable quantity, in mathematics and the sciences (in particular, the difference operator [ 5 ] [ 6 ] ); for example, in y 2 − − y 1 x 2 − − x 1 = Δ Δ y Δ Δ x {\displaystyle {\frac {y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}}={\frac {\Delta y}{\Delta x}}} , the average change of y per unit x (i.e. the change of y over the change of x ). Delta is the initial letter of the Greek word διαφορά , diaphorá , "difference". (The small Latin letter d is used in much the same way for the notation of derivatives and differentials , which also describe change by infinitesimal amounts.) The Laplace operator : Δ Δ f = ∑ ∑ i = 1 n ∂ ∂ 2 f ∂ ∂ x i 2 {\displaystyle \Delta f=\sum _{i=1}^{n}{\frac {\partial ^{2}f}{\partial x_{i}^{2}}}} .

The discriminant of a polynomial equation, especially the quadratic equation : [ 7 ] [ 8 ] Δ Δ = b 2 − − 4 a c {\displaystyle \Delta =b^{2}-4ac} .

The symmetric difference of sets A and B is variously written as A ⊖ B, A∇ B, A+B (Borowski and Borwein 1991) or AΔB (Harris and Stocker 1998, p. 3). All but the first notation should probably be deprecated since each of the other symbols has a common meaning in other areas of mathematics.
