The angle between the radii lying within the bounding semidisks is the dihedral α . If AB is a semidisk that forms a ball when completely revolved about the z -axis, revolving AB only through a given α produces a spherical wedge of the same angle α .

[ 1 ] Beman (2008) [ 2 ] remarks that "a spherical wedge is to the sphere of which it is a part as the angle of the wedge is to a perigon ." [A] A spherical wedge of α = π radians (180°) is called a hemisphere , while a spherical wedge of α = π /2 radians (90°) is sometimes called a semihemisphere (two octants ); a spherical wedge of α = 2 π radians (360°) constitutes a complete ball.

The volume of a spherical wedge can be intuitively related to the AB definition in that while the volume of a ball of radius r is given by ⁠ 4 / 3 ⁠ π r 3 , the volume a spherical wedge of the same radius r is given by [ 3 ] V = α α 2 π π ⋅ ⋅ 4 3 π π r 3 = 2 3 α α r 3 .

{\displaystyle V={\frac {\alpha }{2\pi }}\cdot {\tfrac {4}{3}}\pi r^{3}={\tfrac {2}{3}}\alpha r^{3}\,.} Extrapolating the same principle and considering that the surface area of a sphere is given by 4 π r 2 , it can be seen that the surface area of the lune corresponding to the same wedge is given by [A] A = α α 2 π π ⋅ ⋅ 4 π π r 2 = 2 α α r 2 .

{\displaystyle A={\frac {\alpha }{2\pi }}\cdot 4\pi r^{2}=2\alpha r^{2}\,.} Hart (2009) [ 3 ] states that the "volume of a spherical wedge is to the volume of the sphere as the number of degrees in the [angle of the wedge] is to 360".

[A] Hence, and through derivation of the spherical wedge volume formula, it can be concluded that, if V s is the volume of the sphere and V w is the volume of a given spherical wedge, V w V s = α α 2 π π .

{\displaystyle {\frac {V_{\mathrm {w} }}{V_{\mathrm {s} }}}={\frac {\alpha }{2\pi }}\,.} Also, if S l is the area of a given wedge's lune, and S s is the area of the wedge's sphere, [ 4 ] [A] S l S s = α α 2 π π .

{\displaystyle {\frac {S_{\mathrm {l} }}{S_{\mathrm {s} }}}={\frac {\alpha }{2\pi }}\,.} See also [ edit ] Spherical cap Spherical segment Ungula Notes [ edit ] A.

^ A distinction is sometimes drawn between the terms " sphere " and " ball ", where a sphere is regarded as being merely the outer surface of a solid ball. It is common to use the terms interchangeably, as the commentaries of both Beman (2008) and Hart (2008) do.
