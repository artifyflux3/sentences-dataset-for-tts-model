It is one of four nonconvex regular polyhedra .

It is composed of 12 intersecting pentagrammic faces, with three pentagrams meeting at each vertex.

It shares its vertex arrangement , although not its vertex figure or vertex configuration , with the regular dodecahedron , as well as being a stellation of a (smaller) dodecahedron. It is the only dodecahedral stellation with this property, apart from the dodecahedron itself. Its dual, the great icosahedron , is related in a similar fashion to the icosahedron .

Shaving the triangular pyramids off results in an icosahedron .

If the pentagrammic faces are broken into triangles, it is topologically related to the triakis icosahedron , with the same face connectivity, but much taller isosceles triangle faces. If the triangles are instead made to invert themselves and excavate the central icosahedron, the result is a great dodecahedron .

The great stellated dodecahedron can be constructed analogously to the pentagram, its two-dimensional analogue, by attempting to stellate the n -dimensional pentagonal polytope (which has pentagonal polytope faces and simplex vertex figures) until it can no longer be stellated; that is, it is its final stellation.

It can be constructed as the third of three stellations of the dodecahedron, and referenced as Wenninger model [W22] .

Truncating edges down to points produces the great icosidodecahedron as a rectified great stellated dodecahedron. The process completes as a birectification, reducing the original faces down to points, and producing the great icosahedron .

The truncated great stellated dodecahedron is a degenerate polyhedron, with 20 triangular faces from the truncated vertices, and 12 (hidden) pentagonal faces as truncations of the original pentagram faces, the latter forming a great dodecahedron inscribed within and sharing the edges of the icosahedron.
