Copy created in western Iran or Anatolia, dated 1232-3 Abu Sahl 'Isa ibn Yahya al-Masihi al-Jurjani ( Persian : ابو سهل عيسى‌ بن‌ يحيى مسيحی گرگانی ) was a Christian Persian [ 1 ] [ 2 ] physician, [ 3 ] from Gorgan , east of the Caspian Sea , in Iran .

He was the teacher of Avicenna . He wrote an encyclopedic treatise on medicine of one hundred chapters ( al-mā'a fi-l-sanā'a al-tabi'iyyah ; Arabic : المائة في الصناعة الطبيعية ), which is one of the earliest Arabic works of its kind and may have been in some respects the model of Avicenna's Qanun.

He wrote other treatises on measles, on the plague, on the pulse, and other subjects.

He died in a dust storm in the deserts of Khwarezmia in 1010.

Comparable to al-Rāzi before him and to his own younger contemporary Ibn Sinā, al-Masihi represents the physician-philosopher of classical and Islamic tradition. From the point of view of religious history, it is also of interest that he was descended from Iranian Christians and held, albeit discreetly, to his faith.
