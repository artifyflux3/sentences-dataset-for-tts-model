It primarily refers to bacterial invaders of the cytoplasm of a single genus of marine scuticociliates .

[ 1 ] They are found in ciliates , sometimes with a methanogenic role inside anaerobic ciliates.

[ 2 ] In 1985, researcher John Corliss proposed to expand the definition of the term to include all DNA -containing, membrane-bounded bodies or organelles — prokaryotic or eukaryotic in original nature—found within the cytoplasm or nucleus of eukaryotic cells of any or all kinds, regardless of whether the occupation was temporary or permanent.
