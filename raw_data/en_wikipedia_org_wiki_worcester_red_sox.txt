[ a ] Beginning play in 2021, the team is the Triple-A affiliate of the Boston Red Sox , succeeding the Pawtucket Red Sox . The team competes in the International League , known as the Triple-A East for the 2021 season, [ 7 ] and plays home games at Polar Park in Worcester, Massachusetts.

History [ edit ] In February 2015, a group of New England business leaders, led by Larry Lucchino , purchased the Pawtucket Red Sox , a Triple-A affiliate of the Boston Red Sox since 1973.

[ 8 ] By mid-April, ownership was exploring moving the team from Pawtucket to Providence, Rhode Island .

[ 9 ] In September, Governor of Rhode Island Gina Raimondo stated that the land in Providence being considered for a stadium, "was not suitable and there were too many obstacles that remained." [ 10 ] During 2016, a feasibility study was conducted on potential renovations of the team's Pawtucket ballpark, McCoy Stadium ; and from mid-2017 to mid-2018, building a new ballpark in Pawtucket was explored.

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] Further information: Pawtucket Red Sox § Sale and Rhode Island stadium plans (2015–2018) A financing arrangement for partial public-funding of new stadium in Pawtucket was rejected by team ownership, who announced on August 17, 2018, that the team would relocate to a new stadium in Worcester, Massachusetts , in April 2021.

[ 13 ] While it was initially reported that team would be named the Worcester Red Sox, the club announced a "name-that-team" competition in November 2018.

[ 14 ] The team name was officially announced on November 25, 2019, [ 15 ] and confirmed to be the Worcester Red Sox with "WooSox" as the nickname.

[ 16 ] Like Providence, Worcester fielded a short-lived major league ballclub in the early 1880s, the Worcester Worcesters , who competed in the National League .

[ 17 ] Mascots [ edit ] Woofster at the Worcester Patrick's Day Parade The team's first mascot, Smiley Ball , was introduced in Worcester on October 2, 2020.

[ 18 ] A dog mascot, Woofster , was introduced in Worcester on August 26, 2021.

[ 19 ] Roberto the Rocket was also introduced in Worcester on May 19, 2022.

[ 20 ] The red heart mascot, Clara the Heart of the Commonwealth , was unveiled on May 21, 2024.

[ 21 ] Debut season [ edit ] Polar Park In conjunction with Major League Baseball 's restructuring of Minor League Baseball in 2021, the Red Sox were organized into the 20-team Triple-A East .

[ 22 ] Billy McMillon , who had previously managed the Pawtucket Red Sox, was named Worcester's first manager.

[ 23 ] The team's first games were originally planned for April; [ 24 ] however, the start of the Triple-A season was delayed into May.

[ 25 ] The team released its debut roster on May 3, [ 26 ] and opened the season on May 4 with a loss against the Buffalo Bisons in a game played in Trenton, New Jersey .

[ 27 ] The team played select games as "Los Wepas de Worcester" when participating in the Copa de la Diversión , a Minor League Baseball celebration of Hispanic and Latino heritage.

[ 28 ] In December 2021, team was named winners of the Copa de la Diversión series, and were awarded the "Fun Cup".

[ 29 ] Later seasons [ edit ] In 2022, the Triple-A East became known as the International League , the name historically used by the regional circuit prior to the 2021 reorganization of the minor leagues.

[ 30 ] The 2022 WooSox used the most players by any Red Sox Triple-A team, 75, surpassing the prior record of 70 held by the Pawtucket Red Sox of 1995 and 2006.

[ 31 ] In November 2023, principal owner Larry Luchino stated he was actively looking to sell the team, explaining that at age 78 he wanted to "move on to blissful retirement." [ 32 ] Later that month, the team was purchased by Diamond Baseball Holdings , who also own the Red Sox's Double-A and Single-A franchises, the Portland Sea Dogs and Salem Red Sox .

[ 2 ] Yearly results [ edit ] "Finish" represents the team's final position in its division at the end of regular-season play.

Stadium [ edit ] Main article: Polar Park (baseball park) A new ballpark was constructed for the team, opening for the 2021 Triple-A season.

[ 13 ] The cost (including land acquisition) was $159 million, with over half of the amount paid by the City of Worcester.

[ 37 ] With a capacity of approximately 10,000 spectators, it was named Polar Park through a sponsorship and naming rights agreement with Polar Beverages , which is headquartered in Worcester. The first Triple-A game was played at the ballpark on May 11, 2021, with Worcester hosting the Syracuse Mets .

[ 39 ] Broadcasting [ edit ] In March 2020, WORC-FM (an affiliate of Nash Icon ) was named as the team's flagship radio station.

[ 40 ] The broadcasters as of 2022 are Tyler Murray, Jim Cain, Mike Antonellis, and Cooper Boardman.
