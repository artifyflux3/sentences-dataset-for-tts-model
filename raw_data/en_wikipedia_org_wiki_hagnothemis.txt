Hagnothemis claimed he had heard King Antigonus speak of this, and that the poison was "deadly cold" water distilled from a rock and so "cold and penetrating" that it could only be kept in an ass 's hoof.

[ 1 ] Though the claim spread widely in antiquity, it is now considered unlikely.

Other than this brief passage in Plutarch, we have no further biographical details for Hagnothemis.
