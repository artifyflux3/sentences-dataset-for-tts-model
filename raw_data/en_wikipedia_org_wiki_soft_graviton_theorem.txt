In physics , the soft graviton theorem , first formulated by Steven Weinberg in 1965, [ 1 ] allows calculation of the S-matrix , used in calculating the outcome of collisions between particles , when low-energy (soft) gravitons come into play.

Specifically, if in a collision between n incoming particles from which m outgoing particles arise, the outcome of the collision depends on a certain S matrix, by adding one or more gravitons to the n + m particles, the resulting S matrix (let it be S ') differs from the initial S only by a factor that does not depend in any way, except for the momentum , on the type of particles to which the gravitons couple.

[ 2 ] The theorem also holds by putting photons in place of gravitons, thus obtaining a corresponding soft photon theorem .

The theorem is used in the context of attempts to formulate a theory of quantum gravity in the form of a perturbative quantum theory , that is, as an approximation of a possible, as yet unknown, exact theory of quantum gravity.

[ 3 ] In 2014 Andrew Strominger and Freddy Cachazo expanded the soft graviton theorem, gauge invariant under translation , to the subleading term of the series, obtaining the gauge invariance under rotation (implying global angular momentum conservation) and connected this to the gravitational spin memory effect .

[ 4 ] Formulation [ edit ] Given particles whose interaction is described by a certain initial S matrix, by adding a soft graviton (i.e., whose energy is negligible compared to the energy of the other particles) that couples to one of the incoming or outgoing particles, the resulting S ' matrix is, leaving off some kinematic factors, S ′ = 8 π π G η η p μ μ p ν ν ϵ ϵ μ μ ν ν p ⋅ ⋅ p G − − i η η ε ε S + O ( p G 0 ) {\displaystyle {\cal {S}}'={\sqrt {8\pi G}}{\frac {\eta p^{\mu }p^{\nu }\epsilon _{\mu \nu }}{p\cdot p_{G}-i\eta \varepsilon }}{\cal {S}}+O(p_{G}^{0})} , [ 1 ] [ 5 ] where p is the momentum of the particle interacting with the graviton, ϵ μν is the graviton polarization, p G is the momentum of the graviton, ε is an infinitesimal real quantity which helps to shape the integration contour, and the factor η is equal to 1 for outgoing particles and -1 for incoming particles.

The formula comes from a power series and the last term with the big O indicates that terms of higher order are not considered. Although the series differs depending on the spin of the particle coupling to the graviton, the lowest-order term shown above is the same for all spins.

[ 1 ] In the case of multiple soft gravitons involved, the factor in front of S is the sum of the factors due to each individual graviton.

If a soft photon (whose energy is negligible compared to the energy of the other particles) is added instead of the graviton, the resulting matrix S ' is S ′ = η η q p ⋅ ⋅ ϵ ϵ p ⋅ ⋅ p γ γ − − i η η ε ε S + O ( p γ γ 0 ) {\displaystyle {\cal {S}}'={\frac {\eta qp\cdot \epsilon }{p\cdot p_{\gamma }-i\eta \varepsilon }}{\cal {S}}+O(p_{\gamma }^{0})} , [ 1 ] [ 5 ] with the same parameters as before but with p γ momentum of the photon, ϵ is its polarization , and q the charge of the particle coupled to the photon.

As for the graviton, in case of more photons, a sum over all the terms occurs.

Subleading order expansion [ edit ] The expansion of the formula to the subleading term of the series for the graviton was calculated by Andrew Strominger and Freddy Cachazo: [ 4 ] S ′ = 8 π π G η η p μ μ p ν ν ϵ ϵ μ μ ν ν p ⋅ ⋅ p G − − i η η ε ε S − − i 8 π π G η η p μ μ ( p G ρ ρ J ρ ρ ν ν ) ϵ ϵ μ μ ν ν p ⋅ ⋅ p G − − i η η ε ε S + O ( p G 1 ) {\displaystyle {\cal {S}}'={\sqrt {8\pi G}}{\frac {\eta p^{\mu }p^{\nu }\epsilon _{\mu \nu }}{p\cdot p_{G}-i\eta \varepsilon }}{\cal {S}}-i{\sqrt {8\pi G}}{\frac {\eta p^{\mu }({p_{G}}_{\rho }J^{\rho \nu })\epsilon _{\mu \nu }}{p\cdot p_{G}-i\eta \varepsilon }}{\cal {S}}+O(p_{G}^{1})} , where J ρ ρ ν ν {\displaystyle J^{\rho \nu }} represents the angular momentum of the particle interacting with the graviton.

This formula is gauge invariant under rotation and is connected to the gravitational spin memory effect .
