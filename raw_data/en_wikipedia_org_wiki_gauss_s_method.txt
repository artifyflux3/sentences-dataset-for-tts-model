The required information are the times of observations, the position vectors of the observation points (in Equatorial Coordinate System ), the direction cosine vector of the orbiting body from the observation points (from Topocentric Equatorial Coordinate System) and general physical data.

Working in 1801, Carl Friedrich Gauss developed important mathematical techniques (summed up in Gauss's methods) which were specifically used to determine the orbit of Ceres . The method shown following is the orbit determination of an orbiting body about the focal body where the observations were taken from, whereas the method for determining Ceres' orbit requires a bit more effort because the observations were taken from Earth while Ceres orbits the Sun .

Observer position vector [ edit ] The observer position vector (in Equatorial coordinate system ) of the observation points can be determined from the latitude and local sidereal time (from Topocentric coordinate system ) at the surface of the focal body of the orbiting body (for example, the Earth) via either: Geodetic latitude Geocentric latitude R n = [ R e 1 − − ( 2 f − − f 2 ) sin 2 ⁡ ⁡ ϕ ϕ n + H n ] cos ⁡ ⁡ ϕ ϕ n ( cos ⁡ ⁡ θ θ n I ^ ^ + sin ⁡ ⁡ θ θ n J ^ ^ ) + [ R e ( 1 − − f ) 2 1 − − ( 2 f − − f 2 ) sin 2 ⁡ ⁡ ϕ ϕ n + H n ] sin ⁡ ⁡ ϕ ϕ n K ^ ^ = [ R e 1 − − e 2 sin 2 ⁡ ⁡ ϕ ϕ n + H n ] cos ⁡ ⁡ ϕ ϕ n ( cos ⁡ ⁡ θ θ n I ^ ^ + sin ⁡ ⁡ θ θ n J ^ ^ ) + [ R e ( 1 − − e 2 ) 1 − − e 2 sin 2 ⁡ ⁡ ϕ ϕ n + H n ] sin ⁡ ⁡ ϕ ϕ n K ^ ^ {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\mathbf {R_{n}} &=\left[{R_{e} \over {\sqrt {1-(2f-f^{2})\sin ^{2}\phi _{n}}}}+H_{n}\right]\cos \phi _{n}(\cos \theta _{n}\ \mathbf {\hat {I}} +\sin \theta _{n}\ \mathbf {\hat {J}} )+\left[{R_{e}(1-f)^{2} \over {\sqrt {1-(2f-f^{2})\sin ^{2}\phi _{n}}}}+H_{n}\right]\sin \phi _{n}\ \mathbf {\hat {K}} \\&=\left[{R_{e} \over {\sqrt {1-e^{2}\sin ^{2}\phi _{n}}}}+H_{n}\right]\cos \phi _{n}(\cos \theta _{n}\ \mathbf {\hat {I}} +\sin \theta _{n}\ \mathbf {\hat {J}} )+\left[{R_{e}(1-e^{2}) \over {\sqrt {1-e^{2}\sin ^{2}\phi _{n}}}}+H_{n}\right]\sin \phi _{n}\ \mathbf {\hat {K}} \end{aligned}}} or R n = r e cos ⁡ ⁡ ϕ ϕ n ′ cos ⁡ ⁡ θ θ n I ^ ^ + r e cos ⁡ ⁡ ϕ ϕ n ′ sin ⁡ ⁡ θ θ n J ^ ^ + r e sin ⁡ ⁡ ϕ ϕ n ′ K ^ ^ {\displaystyle \mathbf {R_{n}} =r_{e}\cos \phi '_{n}\cos \theta _{n}\ \mathbf {\hat {I}} +r_{e}\cos \phi '_{n}\sin \theta _{n}\ \mathbf {\hat {J}} +r_{e}\sin \phi '_{n}\ \mathbf {\hat {K}} } where, R n {\displaystyle \mathbf {R_{n}} } is the respective observer position vector (in Equatorial Coordinate System) R e {\displaystyle R_{e}} is the equatorial radius of the central body (e.g., 6,378 km for Earth) r e {\displaystyle r_{e}} is the geocentric distance f {\displaystyle f} is the oblateness (or flattening ) of the central body (e.g., 0.003353 for Earth) e {\displaystyle e} is the eccentricity of the central body (e.g., 0.081819 for Earth) ϕ ϕ n {\displaystyle \phi _{n}} is the geodetic latitude (the angle between the normal line of horizontal plane and the equatorial plane) ϕ ϕ n ′ {\displaystyle \phi '_{n}} is the geocentric latitude (the angle between the radius and the equatorial plane) H n {\displaystyle H_{n}} is the geodetic altitude θ θ n {\displaystyle \theta _{n}} is the local sidereal time of observation site Orbiting body direction cosine vector [ edit ] Right ascension (blue) and declination (green) as seen from outside the celestial sphere The orbiting body direction cosine vector can be determined from the right ascension and declination (from Topocentric Equatorial Coordinate System) of the orbiting body from the observation points via: ρ ρ ^ ^ n = cos ⁡ ⁡ δ δ n cos ⁡ ⁡ α α n I ^ ^ + cos ⁡ ⁡ δ δ n sin ⁡ ⁡ α α n J ^ ^ + sin ⁡ ⁡ δ δ n K ^ ^ {\displaystyle \mathbf {{\hat {\boldsymbol {\rho }}}_{n}} =\cos \delta _{n}\cos \alpha _{n}\ \mathbf {\hat {I}} +\cos \delta _{n}\sin \alpha _{n}\ \mathbf {\hat {J}} +\sin \delta _{n}\ \mathbf {\hat {K}} } where, ρ ρ ^ ^ n {\displaystyle \mathbf {{\hat {\boldsymbol {\rho }}}_{n}} } is the respective unit vector in the direction of the position vector ρ ρ {\displaystyle \rho } (from observation point to orbiting body in Topocentric Equatorial Coordinate System) δ δ n {\displaystyle \delta _{n}} is the respective declination α α n {\displaystyle \alpha _{n}} is the respective right ascension Algorithm [ edit ] The initial derivation begins with vector addition to determine the orbiting body's position vector. Then based on the conservation of angular momentum and Keplerian orbit principles (which states that an orbit lies in a two dimensional plane in three dimensional space), a linear combination of said position vectors is established. Also, the relation between a body's position and velocity vector by Lagrange coefficients is used which results in the use of said coefficients. Then with vector manipulation and algebra, the following equations were derived. For detailed derivation, refer to Curtis.

[ 1 ] NOTE: Gauss's method is a preliminary orbit determination, with emphasis on preliminary. The approximation of the Lagrange coefficients and the limitations of the required observation conditions (i.e., insignificant curvature in the arc between observations, refer to Gronchi [ 2 ] for more details) causes inaccuracies. Gauss's method can be improved, however, by increasing the accuracy of sub-components, such as solving Kepler's equation . Another way to increase the accuracy is through more observations.
