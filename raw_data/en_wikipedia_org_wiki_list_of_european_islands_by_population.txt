Ten islands on the list are not geographically in Europe, but listed since they politically belong.

[ It's a little odd to include e.g. Sakhalin, which is on the other side of the world.

islands by population Notes [ edit ] [ These would be better as footnotes attached to the island to which they refer.

] Population figures for Alderney , Sark and Herm have been deducted from the total population of the Bailiwick of Guernsey . These three are parts of the Bailiwick, but are separate islands.

It could be argued that some islands of Saint Petersburg , most notably Vasilievsky Island and Kamenny Island , should be added. But it is hard to find any statistics on them which is not in Russian.

It is hard to find statistics on Île de la Cité and Île Saint-Louis , the two islands in the Seine in Paris , or to decide whether they belong to the list.

Population figures of some small islands of Iceland (e.g.

Heimaey ) have been deducted from the population of the republic of Iceland.

Madeira Island of Portugal is not included, as it is not a European island.

Canary Islands of Spain are likewise not included, as they are not European islands either.

To be precise, Venice and Chioggia (two distinct cities, the first one at the centre, the second one at the southern end of the Venice Lagoon ) are not two islands themselves, but two groups of larger and smaller lagoon islands, very near one to another but separated by larger and smaller lagoon channels. Just as for Paris and Saint Petersburg, it would be difficult to find statistics about the population of every single island.

The status of Södertörn and Södermalm as islands has been disputed in earlier Wikipedia articles; the publication of [ 4 ] includes a changed definition of an "island" to be used - which clarifies the question, at least in official Swedish statistics.

Population figures (as of 31 December 2013) of Swedish islands except Södermalm and Kungsholmen as published by.

[ 5 ] Population figures for the Swedish island Södermalm do not include the population of the nearby smaller islands of Reimersholme and Långholmen , neither is the population of Hammarby Sjöstad .

Population figures (as of 31 December 2013) of Swedish islands Södermalm and Kungsholmen are calculated from.

[ 6 ] The population shown for Lipari is for the main island; there are a few other inhabited islands in the archipelago.

Footnotes ^ Defined as an island in 2014 by Statistics Sweden ^ Was not an island until a storm in 1825 caused a connection between the North Sea and Limfjord .

[ 2 ] ^ Many small islands connected by bridges ^ The Isle of Lewis and Isle of Harris together form a single island, but by tradition and usage they are often treated as two separate islands.
