1697 –  17 March 1764) was a British politician and astronomer.

Biography [ edit ] George was tutored by Welsh mathematician William Jones , [ 2 ] who went on to become the first person to use the symbol π (the Greek letter Pi ) to represent the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter .

Styled Viscount Parker from 1721 to 1732, he was Member of Parliament (MP) for Wallingford from 1722 to 1727, but his interests were not in politics. In 1722, he became a fellow of the Royal Society , and he spent most of his time in astronomical observations at his Oxfordshire seat, Shirburn Castle , which had been bought by his father in 1716; here he built an observatory and a chemical laboratory.

He was very prominent in making the case in Parliament for the Calendar (New Style) Act 1750 , with which the Kingdom of Great Britain and the British Empire changed from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian calendar in 1752.

When his son ran for parliament as a Whig in 1754, his role in the calendar reform was one of many issues raised by the son's Tory opponents; one of Hogarth 's satirical series of paintings about these elections (1755) is the only source for the subsequent "Give us our eleven days" myth .

From 1752 until his death, Macclesfield was president of the Royal Society , and he made some observations on the great 1755 Lisbon earthquake .

In 1750, Macclesfield was offered the honorary position of vice president of the Foundling Hospital , [ 3 ] which he accepted and kept until his death in 1764. The Foundling Hospital was a charitable institution created a decade earlier, dedicated to saving London 's abandoned children. The Earl seems to have taken his position seriously, as he commissioned the artist Benjamin Wilson to paint a full-size portrait of him, which he then donated to the hospital. The portrait is still in the Foundling Hospital Collection and available to view at the Foundling Museum .

In 1755, Parker was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences . He also was a corresponding member of the Académie des sciences .

[ 4 ] Family [ edit ] George Parker was born in about 1697 to Thomas Parker, 1st Earl of Macclesfield and his wife Janet née Carrier.

[ 5 ] George Parker married twice.
