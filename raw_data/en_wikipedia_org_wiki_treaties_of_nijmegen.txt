Signed 1678–79 Location Nijmegen , Dutch Republic Parties Kingdom of France Dutch Republic Habsburg Spain Brandenburg-Prussia Swedish Empire Denmark–Norway Bishopric of Münster Lüneburg (Celle) Holy Roman Empire The Treaties or Peace of Nijmegen ( French : Traités de Paix de Nimègue ; German : Friede von Nimwegen ; Dutch : Vrede van Nijmegen ) were a series of treaties signed in the Dutch city of Nijmegen between August 1678 and October 1679. The treaties ended various interconnected wars among France , the Dutch Republic , Spain , Brandenburg , Sweden , Denmark-Norway , the Prince-Bishopric of Münster , and the Holy Roman Empire . The most significant of the treaties was the first, which established peace between France and the Dutch Republic and placed the northern border of France very near its modern position .

[ 1 ] Background [ edit ] The Franco-Dutch War of 1672–78 was the source of all the other wars that were ended formally at Nijmegen. Separate peace treaties were arranged for conflicts like the Third Anglo-Dutch War and the Scanian War , but all of them had been directly caused by and form part of the Franco-Dutch War.

England initially participated in the war on the French side but withdrew in 1674, after the Treaty of Westminster . The Electorate of Cologne left the war in 1674, while the Prince-Bishopric of Münster switched sides from France to join the anti-French coalition that year. Denmark-Norway also joined the anti-French side in 1675, primarily fighting against Sweden.

[ citation needed ] At the end of the Franco-Dutch and Scanian Wars, these were the belligerents: Anti-French coalition Dutch Republic Spanish Empire (including Spanish Netherlands ) Denmark-Norway Holy Roman Empire : Brandenburg-Prussia Prince-Bishopric of Münster Principality of Lüneburg (Celle) Duchy of Lorraine and others France and allies Kingdom of France Kingdom of Sweden Treaties [ edit ] Peace negotiations had begun as early as 1676, but nothing was agreed to and signed before 1678. Most treaties were concluded in Nijmegen, therefore the sum of all documents is known as the 'Treaties of Nijmegen'. Some of the countries involved signed peace deals elsewhere, such as the Treaty of Celle (Sweden made peace with Lüneburg (Celle) ), Treaty of Saint-Germain (France and Sweden made peace with Brandenburg) and Treaty of Fontainebleau (France dictated peace between Sweden and Denmark-Norway).

The Franco–Dutch War ended with a treaty which gave France control over the region of the Franche-Comté .

[ 8 ] France also gained further territories of the Spanish Netherlands , adding to those it had annexed under the 1659 Treaty of the Pyrenees and 1668 Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle . These included the town of Saint-Omer with the remaining northwestern part of the former Imperial County of Artois ; the lands of Cassel , Aire and Ypres in southwestern Flanders ; the Bishopric of Cambrai ; and the towns of Valenciennes and Maubeuge in the southern County of Hainaut .

[ citation needed ] In turn, French King Louis XIV ceded the occupied town of Maastricht and the Principality of Orange to the Dutch stadtholder William III . The French forces withdrew from several occupied territories in northern Flanders and Hainaut.

[ citation needed ] Emperor Leopold I retained the captured fortress of Philippsburg but had to accept the French occupation of the towns of Freiburg (until 1697) and Kehl (until 1698) on the right bank of the Rhine .

[ citation needed ] The treaties did not result in a lasting peace.

[ citation needed ] Culture [ edit ] Marc-Antoine Charpentier wrote a Te Deum for this occasion. The prelude of the Te Deum is also known as the Eurovision theme.
