( July 2021 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) The principle of reparation dates back to the lex talionis of Hebrew Scripture .

Anglo-Saxon courts in England before the Norman Conquest also contained this principle. Under the English legal system judges must consider making a compensation order as part of the sentence for a crime. Section 130 of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000 requires the courts to explain their reasoning if they do not issue a compensation order.
