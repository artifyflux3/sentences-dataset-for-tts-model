They are thought to have been formed at least two billion years ago in a catastrophic collision between two larger bodies. The family is named after 158 Koronis , and the largest known member ( 208 Lacrimosa ) is about 41 km (25 mi) in diameter. The Koronis family travels in a cluster along the same orbit.

[ 2 ] It has 5949 members.

[ 1 ] This family has two subfamilies. The Karin family ( FIN: 610 ) was formed remarkably recently in a catastrophic collision (destroying the parent body), with an estimated age of 5.72 million years. The Koronis(2) family ( FIN: 621 ) with 246 members is the other.

[ 1 ] It formed 15 million years ago by a non-catastrophic collision with 158 Koronis .

[ 3 ] On August 28, 1993, the Galileo spacecraft visited a member of this family, 243 Ida . A photo of Ida (and its tiny moon Dactyl) is part of the composite image at right (numbered 243).
