Before Potter died of tuberculosis at the age of 28 he succeeded in producing about 100 paintings, working continuously.

Life [ edit ] The painting The Young Bull (1647) is in the collection of the Mauritshuis Paulus Potter was born in Enkhuizen . He was baptized on 20 November 1625. In 1628 his family moved to Leiden, and in 1631 to Amsterdam , where young Paulus studied painting with his father, Pieter Symonsz Potter .

[ 1 ] After his mother died, his father started an affair with the wife of Pieter Codde , also living in the fancy Sint Antoniesbreestraat .  For some time his father was a manufacturer of gilded leather hangings outside the city walls.

Potter became a member of the Guild of Saint Luke in Delft , but by 1649, he moved to The Hague , next to Jan van Goyen . In July 1650, Potter married Adriana van Balckeneynde (1627-1690). His father-in-law was a leading building contractor in the Hague and introduced him to the Dutch elite.

[ 1 ] Amalia of Solms-Braunfels , a member of the stadholder 's family and an art-lover, bought one of Potter's paintings, The Farmyard , [ 2 ] but some court ladies seemed to have advised against it. In May 1652, he returned to Amsterdam on invitation of Nicolaes Tulp , who owned a number of his paintings. Tulp was impressed by his civilized behavior and politeness and had Potter paint his son, Dirck Tulp , as a noble equestrian.

[ 3 ] Potter composed a will in January of 1653 and died a year later of tuberculosis , two months after his 28th birthday.

Paulus painted a self-portrait which was at Hackwood Park, Hampshire until 1998.

Paintings [ edit ] Potter's most famous painting is The Young Bull (circa 1647), and is not to be confused with his work The Bull .

The Young Bull was composed after drawings Potter made in nature, and is now located in Mauritshuis in The Hague . Though this painting was criticized, it was greatly admired during the 19th century as an early example of Romanticism .

The Young Bull features as the canvas being studied in Mark Tansey 's 1981 monochromatic oil on canvas The Innocent Eye Test .
