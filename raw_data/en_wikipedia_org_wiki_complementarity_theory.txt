For other uses, see Complementarity (disambiguation) .

A complementarity problem is a type of mathematical optimization problem. It is the problem of optimizing (minimizing or maximizing) a function of two vector variables subject to certain requirements (constraints) which include: that the inner product of the two vectors must equal zero, i.e. they are orthogonal.

[ 1 ] In particular for finite-dimensional real vector spaces this means that, if one has vectors X and Y with all nonnegative components ( x i ≥ 0 and y i ≥ 0 for all i {\displaystyle i} : in the first quadrant if 2-dimensional, in the first octant if 3-dimensional), then for each pair of components x i and y i one of the pair must be zero, hence the name complementarity . e.g.

X = (1, 0) and Y = (0, 2) are complementary, but X = (1, 1) and Y = (2, 0) are not. A complementarity problem is a special case of a variational inequality .

History [ edit ] Complementarity problems were originally studied because the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions in linear programming and quadratic programming constitute a linear complementarity problem (LCP) or a mixed complementarity problem (MCP). In 1963 Lemke and Howson showed that, for two person games, computing a Nash equilibrium point is equivalent to an LCP. In 1968 Cottle and Dantzig unified linear and quadratic programming and bimatrix games . Since then the study of complementarity problems and variational inequalities has expanded enormously.

Areas of mathematics and science that contributed to the development of complementarity theory
include: optimization , equilibrium problems, variational inequality theory , fixed point theory , topological degree theory and nonlinear analysis .
