An instrumented metal drum which scientists attempted to place in the path of tornadoes during the 1980s.

The TOtable Tornado Observatory (nicknamed "TOTO") is a large, instrumented barrel-shaped device invented in 1979 by engineers Dr. Al Bedard and Carl Ramzy of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Environmental Technology Laboratory (ETL), and Dr.

Howard Bluestein , meteorologist at the University of Oklahoma (OU). NOAA's objective was to place the TOTO directly in the path of a tornado, where it could, theoretically, record valuable information about the tornado's structure.

[ 1 ] To deploy TOTO, which weighed from 250 to 350 lbs (110–160 kg), two people could unstrap its mooring cables and roll it out of the back of a customized pickup truck in about thirty seconds, using metal wheel ramps. TOTO would then be tipped into a vertical position and swiveled so that a certain side faced north (for accurate wind direction readings). The TOTO crew had to quickly find a relatively level and firm surface, off the road, away from wind obstructions and potential debris generators (such as buildings and trees). With each deployment, there was also a heightened lightning strike risk from handling a large metal object in an open area.

[ 2 ] TOTO was deployed several times during the 1980s.  The closest deployment to a tornado was on April 29, 1985, near Ardmore, Oklahoma , by Steve Smith and Lou Wicker of the National Severe Storms Laboratory (NSSL). It turned out that TOTO had a center of gravity too high for extreme wind, and it fell down as it was sideswiped by the edge of the weak tornado.

[ 2 ] TOTO was also deployed as a portable weather station to measure thunderstorm gust fronts and non-tornadic mesocyclones —with more success than its tornado mission. TOTO was retired after 1987 because of safety issues and the logistical difficulty of getting such a  cumbersome object in front of a tornado.

[ 2 ] TOTO is currently on display at the National Weather Center (NWC) on the University of Oklahoma campus in Norman, Oklahoma .

[ 2 ] TOTO was the inspiration for an instrument package named "Dorothy" in the 1996 Warner Bros.

/ Universal film, Twister , and for a research project in the TV movie Tornado!
