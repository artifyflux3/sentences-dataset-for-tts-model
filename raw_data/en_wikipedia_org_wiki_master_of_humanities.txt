It is the study of human behavior, practices, and thought. Master of Humanities (MH) degrees have been in existence for at least 40 years; a few online programs exist, as well as traditional on-campus programs offering such degrees.

Program advantages [ edit ] Many students in MH programs are preparing to teach at the community-college level, enhance their teaching abilities at the high-school level, or are preparing for Ph.D. programs. MH degrees also offer students opportunities in writing and research, government and non-profit work and creative careers.
