The ray can be formed by any waves, such as optical , acoustic , microwave , and X-ray . In the figure below, the line representing a ray makes an angle θ with the normal (dotted line). The angle of incidence at which light is first totally internally reflected is known as the critical angle . The angle of reflection and angle of refraction are other angles related to beams.

In computer graphics and geography , the angle of incidence is also known as the illumination angle of a surface with a light source, such as the Earth 's surface and the Sun .

[ 1 ] It can also be equivalently described as the angle between the tangent plane of the surface and another plane at right angles to the light rays.

[ 2 ] This means that the illumination angle of a certain point on Earth's surface is 0° if the Sun is precisely overhead and that it is 90° at sunset or sunrise .

Determining the angle of reflection with respect to a planar surface is trivial, but the computation for almost any other surface is significantly more difficult.

The 90-degree complement to the angle of incidence is called the grazing angle or glancing angle . Incidence at small grazing angles is called "grazing incidence." [ citation needed ] Grazing incidence diffraction is used in X-ray spectroscopy and atom optics , where significant reflection can be achieved only at small values of the grazing angle.

Ridged mirrors are designed to reflect atoms coming at a small grazing angle. This angle is usually measured in milliradians . In optics, there is Lloyd's mirror .
