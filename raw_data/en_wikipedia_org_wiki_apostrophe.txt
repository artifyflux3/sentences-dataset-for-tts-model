The **apostrophe** (**’**, **'**) is a [punctuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punctuation "Punctuation") mark, and sometimes a [diacritical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic "Diacritic") mark, in languages that use the [Latin alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_alphabet "Latin alphabet") and some other alphabets. In English, the apostrophe is used for two basic purposes:

*   The marking of the omission of one or more letters, e.g. the [contraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraction_(grammar) "Contraction (grammar)") of "do not" to "don't"
*   The marking of [possessive case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Possessive "Possessive") of nouns (as in "the eagle's feathers", "in one month's time", "the twins' coats")

It is also used in a few exceptional cases for the [marking of plurals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#Use_in_forming_some_plurals), e.g. "p's and q's" or [Oakland A's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_A%27s "Oakland A's").

The same mark is used as a [single quotation mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_quotation_mark "Single quotation mark"). It is also substituted informally for other marks– for example instead of the [prime symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_symbol "Prime symbol") to indicate the units of [foot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot_(unit) "Foot (unit)") or [minutes of arc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minutes_of_arc "Minutes of arc").

The word _apostrophe_ comes from the [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_language "Ancient Greek language")ἡ ἀπόστροφος [προσῳδία] (hē apóstrophos [prosōidía], '[the accent of] turning away or elision'), through [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_language "Latin language") and [French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language "French language").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-2)

### Historical development

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Apostrophe&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Historical development")]

The apostrophe was first used by [Pietro Bembo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pietro_Bembo "Pietro Bembo") in his edition of _[De Aetna](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=De\_Aetna&action=edit&redlink=1 "De Aetna (page does not exist)")_ (1496).[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-Castellani-3) It was introduced into English in the 16th century in imitation of French practice.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-Crystal-4)

Introduced by [Geoffroy Tory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffroy_Tory "Geoffroy Tory") (1529),[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-5) the apostrophe was used in place of a vowel letter to indicate [elision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elision_in_the_French_language "Elision in the French language") (as in _l'heure_ in place of _la heure_). It was also frequently used in place of a final "e" (which was still pronounced at the time) when it was elided before a vowel, as in _un' heure_. Modern French [orthography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthography "Orthography") has restored the spelling _une heure_.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-6)

#### Early English practice

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Apostrophe&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Early English practice")]

From the 16th century, following French practice, the apostrophe was used when a vowel letter was omitted either because of incidental [elision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elision "Elision") ("I'm" for "I am") or because the letter no longer represented a sound ("lov'd" for "loved"). [English spelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_orthography "English orthography") retained many [inflections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflection "Inflection") that were not pronounced as [syllables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable "Syllable"), notably verb endings ("-est", "-eth", "-es", "-ed") and the noun ending "-es", which marked either plurals or possessives, also known as [genitives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genitive_case "Genitive case")(see [Possessive apostrophe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#Possessive_apostrophe), below). An apostrophe followed by "s" was often used to mark a plural;[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-Crystal-4) specifically, the _[Oxford Companion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford\_Companion "Oxford Companion") to the English Language_ notes that:

> There was formerly a respectable tradition (17th to 19th centuries) of using the apostrophe for noun plurals, especially in [loanwords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loanword "Loanword") ending in a vowel (as in[...] _Comma's are used_, [Philip Luckcombe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Luckombe "Philip Luckombe"), 1771) and in the consonants _s_, _z_, _ch_, _sh_, (as in _waltz's_ and _cotillions_, [Washington Irving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Irving "Washington Irving"), 1804)...[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-OxComp92-7)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-OxComp18-8)

The use of [elision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elision "Elision") has continued to the present day, but significant changes have been made to the [possessive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Possessive_case "Possessive case") and [plural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plural "Plural") uses. By the 18th century, an apostrophe with the addition of an "s" was regularly used for all [possessive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Possessive_case "Possessive case")[singular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_number "Grammatical number") forms, even when the letter "e" was not omitted (as in "the gate's height"). This was regarded as representing not the elision of the "e" in the "-e" or "-es" ending of the word being pluralized, but the elision of the "e" from the [Old English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English "Old English")[genitive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genitive "Genitive") singular [inflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflection "Inflection") "-es".

The plural genitive did not use the "-es" inflection,[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-Wilde2012-9) and since many plural forms already consisted of the "-s" or "-es" ending, using the apostrophe in place of the elisioned "e" could lead to singular and plural possessives of a given word having the exact same spelling. The solution was to use an apostrophe after the [plural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plural "Plural") "s" (as in "girls' dresses"). However, this was not universally accepted until the mid-19th century.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-Crystal-4) Plurals not ending in -s keep the -'s marker, such as "children's toys, the men's toilet", since there was no risk of ambiguity.

### Possessive apostrophe

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Apostrophe&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Possessive apostrophe")]

The apostrophe is used in English to indicate what is, for historical reasons, misleadingly called the [possessive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Possessive "Possessive") case in the English language. This case was called the [genitive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genitive_case "Genitive case") until the 18th century and, like the genitive case in other languages, expresses relationships other than [possession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Possession_(linguistics) "Possession (linguistics)"). For example, in the expressions "the school's headmaster", "the men's department", and "tomorrow's weather", the school does not own/possess the headmaster, men do not own/possess the department, and tomorrow does not/will not own the weather. In the words of [Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of English Usage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merriam-Webster%27s_Dictionary_of_English_Usage "Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of English Usage"):

> The argument is a case of fooling oneself with one's own terminology. After the 18th-century grammarians began to refer to the genitive case as the possessive case, grammarians and other commentators got it into their heads that the only use of the case was to show possession[...] Simply changing the name of the genitive does not change or eliminate any of its multiple functions.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-10)

This dictionary also cites a study[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-11) that found that only 40% of the possessive forms were used to indicate actual possession.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-12)

The modern spelling convention distinguishes possessive singular forms ("Bernadette's", "flower's", "glass's", "one's") from simple plural forms ("Bernadettes", "flowers", "glasses", "ones"), and both of those from possessive plural forms ("Bernadettes'", "flowers'", "glasses'", "ones'"). For example, the word "glass's" is the singular possessive form of the noun "glass". The plural form of "glass" is "glasses" and the plural possessive form is, therefore, "glasses'". One would therefore say "I drank the glass's contents" to indicate drinking from one glass, but "I drank the glasses' contents" after also drinking from another glass.

For singular forms, the modern possessive or [genitive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genitive "Genitive") inflection is a survival from [certain genitive inflections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English_grammar#Nouns "Old English grammar") in Old English, for which the apostrophe originally marked the loss of the old "e" (for example, _lambes_ became _lamb's_). Its use for indicating plural "possessive" forms was not standard before the middle of the 19th century.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

#### General principles for the possessive apostrophe

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Apostrophe&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: General principles for the possessive apostrophe")]

##### Summary of rules for most situations

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Apostrophe&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Summary of rules for most situations")]

*   Possessive personal pronouns, serving as either noun-equivalents or adjective-equivalents, do not use an apostrophe, even when they end in "s". The complete list of those ending in the letter "s" or the corresponding sound /s/ or /z/ but not taking an apostrophe is "ours", "yours", "his", "hers", "its", "theirs", and "whose".
*   Other pronouns, singular nouns not ending in "s", and plural nouns not ending in "s" all take "'s" in the possessive: e.g., "someone's", "a cat's toys", "women's".
*   Plural nouns already ending in "s" take only an apostrophe after the pre-existing "s" to form the possessive: e.g., "three cats' toys".

##### Basic rule (singular nouns)

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Apostrophe&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Basic rule (singular nouns)")]

For most singular nouns the ending "'s" is added; e.g., "the cat's whiskers".

*   If a singular noun ends with an "s"-sound (spelled with "-s", "-se", for example), practice varies as to whether to add "'s" or the apostrophe alone. In many cases, both spoken and written forms differ between writers (see details [below](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#Singular_nouns_ending_with_an_%22s%22_or_%22z%22_sound)).
*   Acronyms and initialisms used as nouns (CD, DVD, NATO, RADAR, etc.) follow the same rules as singular nouns: e.g., "the TV's picture quality".

##### Basic rule (plural nouns)

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Apostrophe&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Basic rule (plural nouns)")]

When the noun is a normal plural, with an added "s", no extra "s" is added in the possessive, and it is pronounced accordingly; so "the neighbours' garden" (there is more than one neighbour owning the garden) is standard rather than "the neighbours's garden".

*   If the plural is not one that is formed by adding "s", an "s" is added for the possessive, after the apostrophe: "children's hats", "women's hairdresser", "some people's eyes" (but compare "some peoples' recent emergence into nationhood", where "peoples" is meant as the plural of the singular "people"). These principles are universally accepted.
*   A few English nouns have plurals that are not spelled with a final "s" but nevertheless end in an /s/ or a /z/ sound: "mice" (plural of "mouse"; also in compounds like "[dormouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dormouse "Dormouse")", "[titmouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titmouse "Titmouse")"), "[dice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice "Dice")" (when used as the plural of "die"), "pence" (a plural of "penny", with compounds like "sixpence" that now tend to be taken as singulars). In the absence of specific exceptional treatment in style guides, the possessives of these plurals are formed by adding an apostrophe and an "s" in the standard way: "seven [titmice's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titmice "Titmice") tails were found", "the dice's last fall was a seven", "his few pence's value was not enough to buy bread". These would often be rephrased, where possible: "the last fall of the dice was a seven".[[note 1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-13)

##### Basic rule (compound nouns)

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Apostrophe&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Basic rule (compound nouns)")]

Compound nouns have their singular possessives formed with an apostrophe and an added _s_, in accordance with the rules given above: _the Attorney-General's husband_; _the [Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord\_Warden\_of\_the\_Cinque\_Ports "Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports")'s prerogative_; _this Minister for Justice's intervention_; _her father-in-law's new wife_.

*   In such examples, the plurals are formed with an _s_ that does not occur at the end: e.g., _attorneys-general_. A problem therefore arises with the _possessive_ plurals of these compounds. Sources that rule on the matter appear to favour the following forms, in which there is both an _s_ added to form the plural, and a separate _'s_ added for the possessive: _the attorneys-general's husbands_; _successive Ministers for Justice's interventions_; _their fathers-in-law's new wives_.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-14)[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-15)[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-16) Because these constructions stretch the resources of punctuation beyond comfort, in practice they are normally reworded: _interventions by successive Ministers for Justice_.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-17)[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-18)

##### Joint or separate possession

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Apostrophe&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Joint or separate possession")]

For two nouns (or noun phrases) joined by _and_, there are several ways of expressing possession, including:

1. marking of the last noun (e.g. "Jack and Jill's children")2. marking of both nouns (e.g. "Jack's and Jill's children").[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-Cambridge_Grammar:_Coordination_and_genitives-19)
Some grammars make no distinction in meaning between the two forms.[[note 2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-21) Some publishers' style guides, however, make a distinction, assigning the "segregatory" (or "distributive") meaning to the form "John's and Mary's" and the "combinatorial" (or "joint") meaning to the form "John and Mary's".[[note 3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-25) A third alternative is a construction of the form "Jack's children and Jill's", which is always distributive, i.e. it designates the combined set of Jack's children and Jill's children.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-Cambridge_Grammar:_Coordination_and_genitives-19)

When a coordinate possessive construction has two personal pronouns, the normal possessive inflection is used, and there is no apostrophe (e.g., "his and her children"). The issue of the use of the apostrophe arises when the coordinate construction includes a noun (phrase) and a pronoun. In this case, the inflection of only the last item may sometimes be, at least marginally, acceptable ("you and your spouse's bank account").[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-Cambridge_Grammar:_Coordination_and_genitives-19)[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-Comprehensive_Grammar:_Coordination_of_genitives-20) The inflection of both is normally preferred (e.g. Jack's and your dogs), but there is a tendency to avoid this construction, too, in favour of a construction that does not use a coordinate possessive (e.g. by using "Jack's letters and yours").[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-Cambridge_Grammar:_Coordination_and_genitives-19) Where a construction like "Jack's and your dogs" is used, the interpretation is usually "segregatory" (i.e. not joint possession).[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-Comprehensive_Grammar:_Coordination_of_genitives-20)

##### With other punctuation; compounds with pronouns

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Apostrophe&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: With other punctuation; compounds with pronouns")]

If the word or compound includes, or ends with, a punctuation mark, an apostrophe and an _s_ are still added in the usual way: "[Westward Ho!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westward_Ho! "Westward Ho!")'s railway station"; "_Awaye!_'s Paulette Whitten recorded Bob Wilson's story";[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-26)[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-27)_Washington, D.C.'s museums_.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-28) (assuming that the prevailing style requires full stops in _D.C._).

*   If the word or compound already includes a possessive apostrophe, a double possessive results: _Tom's sisters' careers_; _the head of marketing's husband's preference_; _the [master of foxhounds'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox\_hunting "Fox hunting") best dog's death_. Many style guides, while allowing that these constructions are possible, advise rephrasing: _the head of marketing's husband prefers that..._. If an original apostrophe or apostrophe with _s_ occurs at the end, it is left by itself to serve both purposes: _Our employees are better paid than McDonald's employees_; _Standard & Poor's indices are widely used_: the fixed forms of _[McDonald's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonald%27s "McDonald's")_ and _[Standard & Poor's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard\_%26\_Poor%27s "Standard & Poor's")_ already include possessive apostrophes. For similar cases involving geographical names, see [below](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#Possessives_in_geographic_names).
*   Similarly, the possessives of all phrases whose wording is fixed are formed in the same way: 
    *   "[Us and Them](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Us_and_Them_(song) "Us and Them (song)")"'s inclusion on the album _[The Dark Side of the Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Dark\_Side\_of\_the\_Moon "The Dark Side of the Moon")_
    *   [You Am I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Am_I "You Am I")'s latest CD
    *   [The 69'ers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_69%27ers "The 69'ers")' drummer, Tom Callaghan (only the second apostrophe is possessive)
    *   _[His 'n' Hers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/His\_%27n%27\_Hers "His 'n' Hers")_'s first track is called "Joyriders".[[note 4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-29)
    *   Was _[She](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/She\_(novel) "She (novel)")_'s success greater, or _[King Solomon's Mines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King\_Solomon%27s\_Mines "King Solomon's Mines")_'s?[[note 5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-30)

For complications with foreign phrases and titles, see [below](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#Nouns_ending_with_silent_s,_x,_or_z).

##### Time, money, and similar

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Apostrophe&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Time, money, and similar")]

An apostrophe is used in time and money references in constructions such as _one hour's respite_, _two weeks' holiday_, _a dollar's worth_, _five pounds' worth_, _one mile's drive from here_. This is like an ordinary possessive use. For example, _one hour's respite_ means _a respite of one hour_ (exactly as _the cat's whiskers_ means _the whiskers of the cat_).

##### Possessive pronouns and adjectives

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Apostrophe&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Possessive pronouns and adjectives")]

No apostrophe is used in the following possessive pronouns and adjectives: _hers_, _his_, _its_, _my_, _mine_, _ours_, _theirs_, _whose_, and _yours_. All other possessive pronouns do end with an apostrophe and an _s_. In singular forms, the apostrophe comes first, e.g. _one's_; _everyone's_; _somebody's_, _nobody else's_, etc., while the apostrophe follows the _s_ in plural forms as with nouns: _the others' complaints_.

The possessive of _it_ was originally _it's_, in contrast to the modern _its_. The apostrophe was dropped by the early 19th century. Authorities are now unanimous that _[it's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s "It's")_ can be only a contraction of _it is_ or _it has_.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-31)[[note 6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-32) Despite this, using _it's_ as a possessive pronoun is a common [grammatical error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_error "Grammatical error") in present times.

##### Importance for disambiguation

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Apostrophe&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Importance for disambiguation")]

Each of these four phrases (listed in [Steven Pinker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Pinker "Steven Pinker")'s _[The Language Instinct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Language\_Instinct "The Language Instinct")_) has a distinct meaning:

*   My sister's friend's investment _(the investment belonging to a friend of my sister)_
*   My sister's friends' investment _(the investment belonging to several friends of my sister)_
*   My sisters' friend's investment _(the investment belonging to a friend of several of my sisters)_
*   My sisters' friends' investment _(the investment belonging to several friends of several of my sisters)_

[Kingsley Amis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingsley_Amis "Kingsley Amis"), on being challenged to produce a sentence whose meaning depended on a possessive apostrophe, came up with:

*   Those things over there are my husband's. (_Those things over there belong to my husband._)
*   Those things over there are my husbands'. (_Those things over there belong to several husbands of mine._)
*   Those things over there are my husbands. (_I'm married to those men over there._)[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-33)

#### Singular nouns ending with an "s" or "z" sound

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Apostrophe&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Singular nouns ending with an \"s\" or \"z\" sound")]

Some singular nouns are pronounced with a [sibilant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sibilant "Sibilant") sound at the end: /s/ or /z/. The spelling of these ends with _-s_, _-se_, _-z_, _-ze_, _-ce_, _-x_, or _-xe_.

Most respected authorities recommend that practically all singular nouns, including those ending with a sibilant sound, have possessive forms with an extra _s_ after the apostrophe so that the spelling reflects the underlying pronunciation. Examples include [Oxford University Press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_University_Press "Oxford University Press"), the [Modern Language Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLA_style_manual "MLA style manual"), the [BBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC "BBC") and _[The Economist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Economist "The Economist")_.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-34) Such authorities demand possessive singulars like these: _[Bridget Jones's Diary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridget\_Jones%27s\_Diary "Bridget Jones's Diary")_; _Tony Adams's friend; my boss's job; the US's economy_. Rules that modify or extend the standard principle have included the following:

*   If the singular possessive is difficult or awkward to pronounce with an added sibilant, do not add an extra _s_; these exceptions are supported by the _[Yahoo!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo! "Yahoo!") Style Guide_,[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-35) and _[The American Heritage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_American\_Heritage\_Dictionary\_of\_the\_English\_Language "The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language") Book of English Usage_.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-36) Such sources permit possessive singulars like these: _Socrates' later suggestion_; or _Achilles' heel_ if that is how the pronunciation is intended. The style guides of _[The Economist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Economist "The Economist")_[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-37) and _[The Guardian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Guardian "The Guardian")_[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-38) omit the extra s in this case.
*   Some style guides advise that Classical, biblical, and similar names ending in a sibilant, especially if they are [polysyllabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysyllabic "Polysyllabic"), should not take an added _s_ in the possessive; among sources giving exceptions of this kind are _[The Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Times "The Times")_[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-39) and _The Elements of Style_, which make general stipulations, and [Vanderbilt University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanderbilt_University "Vanderbilt University"),[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-40) which mentions only _[Moses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses "Moses")_ and _Jesus_. As a particular case, _Jesus'_– referred to as "an accepted liturgical archaism" in _[Hart's Rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hart%27s\_Rules "Hart's Rules")_– is commonly written instead of _Jesus's_.
*   There are also some entrenched uses, for example _[St James's Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St\_James%27s\_Park "St James's Park")_ (in London) (but the Newcastle stadium displays its name spelled _[St James' Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St\_James%27\_Park "St James' Park")_), _[St James's Palace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St\_James%27s\_Palace "St James's Palace")_ (and _the [Court of St James's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court\_of\_St\_James%27s "Court of St James's")_), _[St. James's Hospital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St.\_James%27s\_Hospital "St. James's Hospital")_ (in Dublin), [_King James's School_, Knaresborough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_James%27s_School,_Knaresborough "King James's School, Knaresborough") and [_King James's School_, Almondbury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_James%27s_School,_Almondbury "King James's School, Almondbury") (but there is no genitive at all in [_St James Park_ (Exeter)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_James_Park_(Exeter) "St James Park (Exeter)") or [_St. James Park_ (Bronx)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._James_Park_(Bronx) "St. James Park (Bronx)"); nor is there one in _the [King James Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King\_James\_Bible "King James Bible")_ since, like the _[Hebrew Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew\_Bible "Hebrew Bible")_, it is a description not a possessive).

Although less common, some contemporary writers still follow the older practice of omitting the second _s_ in some cases ending with a sibilant, but usually not when written _-x_ or _-xe_.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-41) The Associated Press Stylebook[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-42) recommends or allows the practice of omitting the additional "s" in [proper nouns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_noun "Proper noun") ending with an "s", but not in words ending with other sibilants ("z" and "x").[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-43) The 15th edition of _[The Chicago Manual of Style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Chicago\_Manual\_of\_Style "The Chicago Manual of Style")_ had recommended the traditional practice, which included providing for several exceptions to accommodate spoken usage such as the omission of the extra _s_ after a polysyllabic word ending in a sibilant, but the 16th edition no longer recommends omitting the possessive "s".[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-44)

Similar examples of notable names ending in an _s_ that are often given a possessive apostrophe with no additional _s_ include _Dickens_ and _Williams_. There is often a policy of leaving off the additional _s_ on any such name, but this can prove problematic when specific names are contradictory (for example, _[St James' Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St\_James%27\_Park "St James' Park")_ in [Newcastle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_upon_Tyne "Newcastle upon Tyne") [the football ground] and the area of _[St James's Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St\_James%27s\_Park "St James's Park")_ in London). However, debate has been going on regarding the punctuation of St James' Park (Newcastle) for some time, unlike St James's Park (London) which is the less contentious version. For more details on practice with geographic names, see the relevant section [below](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#Possessives_in_geographic_names).

Some writers like to reflect standard spoken practice in cases like these with _sake_: _for convenience' sake_, _for goodness' sake_, _for appearance' sake_, _for compromise' sake_, etc. This punctuation is preferred in major style guides. Others prefer to add _'s_: _for convenience's sake_.[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-45) Still others prefer to omit the apostrophe when there is an _s_ sound before _sake_: _for morality's sake_, but _for convenience sake_.[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-46)

#### Nouns ending with silent _s_, _x_, or _z_

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Apostrophe&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Nouns ending with silent s, x, or z")]

The English possessive of French nouns ending in a silent _s_, _x_, or _z_ is addressed by various style guides. Certainly a sibilant is pronounced in examples like _Descartes's_ and _Dumas's_; the question addressed here is whether _s_ needs to be added. Similar examples with _x_ or _z_: _\_[Sauce Périgueux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauce\\_P%C3%A9rigueux "Sauce Périgueux")\_'s main ingredient is truffle_; _His \_[pince-nez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pince-nez "Pince-nez")\_'s loss went unnoticed_; _"Verreaux('s) eagle, a large, predominantly black eagle,_ Aquila verreauxi _,..."_ ([OED](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OED "OED"), entry for "Verreaux", with silent _x_; see [Verreaux's eagle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verreaux%27s_eagle "Verreaux's eagle")); in each of these some writers might omit the added _s_. The same principles and residual uncertainties apply with "naturalised" English words, like _Illinois_ and _Arkansas_.[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-47)

For possessive _plurals_ of words ending in a silent _x_, _z_ or _s_, the few authorities that address the issue at all typically call for an added _s_ and suggest that the apostrophe precede the _s_: _The Loucheux's homeland is in the Yukon_; _Compare the two Dumas's literary achievements_.[[note 7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-48) The possessive of a cited French title with a silent plural ending is uncertain: "_Trois femmes_'s long and complicated publication history",[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-49) but "_[Les noces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les\_noces "Les noces")_' singular effect was 'exotic primitive' ..." (with nearby sibilants _-ce-_ in _noces_ and _s-_ in _singular_).[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-50) Compare treatment of other titles, [above](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#With_other_punctuation;_compounds_with_pronouns).

Guides typically seek a principle that will yield uniformity, even for foreign words that fit awkwardly with standard English punctuation.

#### Possessives in geographic names

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Apostrophe&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: Possessives in geographic names")]

Place names in the United States do not use the possessive apostrophe on federal maps and signs.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-TimesGeo-51) The [United States Board on Geographic Names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Board_on_Geographic_Names "United States Board on Geographic Names"), which has responsibility for formal naming of municipalities and geographic features, has deprecated the use of possessive apostrophes since 1890 so as not to show ownership of the place.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-TimesGeo-51)[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-TheBoard-52) Only five names of natural features in the US are officially spelled with a genitive apostrophe: [Martha's Vineyard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha%27s_Vineyard "Martha's Vineyard"); [Ike's Point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ike%27s_Point "Ike's Point"), New Jersey; [John E's Pond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_E%27s_Pond "John E's Pond"), Rhode Island; [Carlos Elmer's Joshua View](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Elmer "Carlos Elmer"), Arizona; and [Clark's Mountain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark%27s_Mountain "Clark's Mountain"), Oregon.[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-TheBoard-52)[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-53) Some municipalities, originally incorporated using the apostrophe, have dropped it in accordance with this policy; [Taylors Falls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylors_Falls "Taylors Falls") in Minnesota, for example, was originally incorporated as "Taylor's Falls".[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-54) On the state level, the federal policy is not always followed: [Vermont](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermont "Vermont")'s official state website has a page on [Camel's Hump State Forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel%27s_Hump_State_Forest "Camel's Hump State Forest").[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-55)

Australia's [Intergovernmental Committee on Surveying and Mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intergovernmental_Committee_on_Surveying_and_Mapping "Intergovernmental Committee on Surveying and Mapping") also has a no-apostrophe policy, a practice it says goes back to the 1900s[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-56) and which is generally followed around the country.[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-57)

On the other hand, the United Kingdom has [Bishop's Stortford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop%27s_Stortford "Bishop's Stortford"), [Bishop's Castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop%27s_Castle "Bishop's Castle") and [King's Lynn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_Lynn "King's Lynn") (among many others) but [St Albans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Albans "St Albans"), [St Andrews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Andrews "St Andrews") and [St Helens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Helens,_Merseyside "St Helens, Merseyside"). London Underground's Piccadilly line has the adjacent stations of [Earl's Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl%27s_Court_tube_station "Earl's Court tube station") in [Earl's Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl%27s_Court "Earl's Court") and [Barons Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barons_Court_tube_station "Barons Court tube station"). These names were mainly fixed in form many years before grammatical rules were fully standardised. While [Newcastle United](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_United_F.C. "Newcastle United F.C.") play [football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football "Association football") at a stadium called [St James' Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_James%27_Park "St James' Park"), and [Exeter City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exeter_City "Exeter City") at [St James Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_James_Park,_Exeter "St James Park, Exeter"), London has a [St James's Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_James%27s_Park "St James's Park") (this whole area of London is named after the parish of [St James's Church, Piccadilly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_James%27s_Church,_Piccadilly "St James's Church, Piccadilly")[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-58)).

Modern usage has been influenced by considerations of technological convenience including the economy of typewriter ribbons and films, and similar computer character "disallowance" which tend to ignore past standards.[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-59) Practice in the United Kingdom and Canada is not so uniform.[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-60)

#### Possessives in names of organizations

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Apostrophe&action=edit&section=20 "Edit section: Possessives in names of organizations")]

Sometimes the apostrophe is omitted in the names of clubs, societies, and other organizations, even though the standard principles seem to require it: _[Country Women's Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country\_Women%27s\_Association "Country Women's Association")_, but _International Aviation Womens Association_;[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-61)_[Magistrates' Court of Victoria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magistrates%27\_Court\_of\_Victoria "Magistrates' Court of Victoria")_,[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-62) but _[Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federated\_Ship\_Painters\_and\_Dockers\_Union "Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union")_. Usage is variable and inconsistent. Style guides typically advise consulting an official source for the standard form of the name (as one would do if uncertain about other aspects of the spelling of the name); some tend towards greater prescriptiveness, for or against such an apostrophe.[[note 8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-63) As the case of _womens_ shows, it is not possible to analyze these forms simply as non-possessive plurals, since _women_ is the only correct plural form of _woman_.

#### Possessives in business names

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Apostrophe&action=edit&section=21 "Edit section: Possessives in business names")]

Where a business name is based on a family name it should in theory take an apostrophe, but many leave it out (contrast _[Sainsbury's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sainsbury%27s "Sainsbury's")_ with _[Harrods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrods "Harrods")_). In recent times there has been an increasing tendency to drop the apostrophe. Names based on a first name are more likely to take an apostrophe, but this is not always the case. Some business names may inadvertently spell a different name if the name with an _s_ at the end is also a name, such as Parson. A small activist group called the [Apostrophe Protection Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe_Protection_Society "Apostrophe Protection Society")[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-64) has campaigned for large retailers such as Harrods, [Currys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currys "Currys"), and [Selfridges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfridges "Selfridges") to reinstate their missing punctuation. A spokesperson for [Barclays PLC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barclays_PLC "Barclays PLC") stated, "It has just disappeared over the years. Barclays is no longer associated with the family name."[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-Times-65) Further confusion can be caused by businesses whose names look as if they should be pronounced differently without an apostrophe, such as Paulos Circus, and other companies that leave the apostrophe out of their logos but include it in written text, such as [Cadwalader's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadwalader%27s "Cadwalader's").

### Apostrophe showing omission

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Apostrophe&action=edit&section=22 "Edit section: Apostrophe showing omission")]

An apostrophe is commonly used to indicate omitted characters, normally letters:

*   It is used in [contractions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraction_(grammar) "Contraction (grammar)"), such as _can't_ from _cannot_, _it's_ from _it is_ or _it has_, and _I'll_ from _I will_ or _I shall_.[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-66)
*   It is used in [abbreviations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbreviation "Abbreviation"), as _gov't_ for _government_. It may indicate omitted numbers where the spoken form is also capable of omissions, as _'70s_ for _1970s_ representing _seventies_ for _nineteen-seventies_. In modern usage, apostrophes are generally omitted when letters are removed from the start of a word, particularly for a [compound word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_word "Compound word"). For example, it is not common to write _'bus_ (for _omnibus_), _'phone_ (_telephone_), _'net_ (_Internet_). However, if the shortening is unusual, dialectal or archaic, the apostrophe may still be used to mark it (e.g., _'bout_ for _about_, _'less_ for _unless_, _'twas_ for _it was_). Sometimes a misunderstanding of the original form of a word results in a non-standard contraction. A common example: _'til_ for _until_, though _till_ is in fact the original form, and _until_ is derived from it. 
    *   The spelling _fo'c's'le_, contracted from the nautical term _forecastle_, is unusual for having three apostrophes. The spelling _bo's'n's_ (from _boatswain's_), as in _Bo's'n's Mate_, also has three apostrophes, two showing omission and one possession. _Fo'c's'le_ may also take a possessive _s_– as in _the fo'c's'le's timbers_– giving four apostrophes in one word.[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-67) A word which formerly contained two apostrophes is _sha'n't_ for _shall not_, examples of which may be found in the older works of [P. G. Wodehouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._G._Wodehouse "P. G. Wodehouse") and "Frank Richards" ([Charles Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Hamilton_(writer) "Charles Hamilton (writer)")), but this has been superseded by _shan't_.
    *   Shortenings with more apostrophes, such as _y'all'dn't've_ ([y'all](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y%27all "Y'all") wouldn't have), are possible, particularly in [Southern US dialects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_American_English "Southern American English").[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-68)

*   It is sometimes used when the normal form of an inflection seems awkward or unnatural; for example, _KO'd_ rather than _KOed_ (where _KO_ is used as a verb meaning "to knock out"); "_a spare [pince-nez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pince-nez "Pince-nez")'d man_" (cited in [OED](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OED "OED"), entry for "pince-nez"; _pince-nezed_ is also in citations).
*   An apostrophe's function as possessive or contractive can depend on the grammatical context: 
    *   We rehearsed for Friday's opening night. (_We rehearsed for the opening night on Friday._)
    *   We rehearsed because Friday's opening night. (_We rehearsed because Friday is opening night._ "Friday's" here is a contraction of "Friday is".)

*   [Eye dialects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_dialect "Eye dialect") use apostrophes in creating the effect of a non-standard pronunciation.
*   Apostrophes to omit letters in place names are common on British road signs when space does not allow for the full name– for example, [Wolverhampton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverhampton "Wolverhampton") abbreviated as "W'hampton" and [Kidderminster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidderminster "Kidderminster") as "K'minster".[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-69)
*   The [United States Board on Geographic Names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Board_on_Geographic_Names "United States Board on Geographic Names"), while discouraging possessive apostrophes in place names, allows apostrophes indicating omission, as in "Lake O' the Woods", or when normally present in a surname, as in "O'Malley Draw".[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-70)

### Use in forming some plurals

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Apostrophe&action=edit&section=23 "Edit section: Use in forming some plurals")]

[![Image 1](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Oakland_A%27s_logo.svg/250px-Oakland_A%27s_logo.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Oakland_A%27s_logo.svg)

An apostrophe can be used in the plural form of a single letter, as seen in the team logo of the [Oakland A's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_Athletics "Oakland Athletics").

Following an evolution in usage in the 20th century, today "the apostrophe of plurality continues in at least five areas":[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-OxComp18-8) abbreviations, letters of the alphabet/small words, numbers, family names, and in [non-standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonstandard_dialect "Nonstandard dialect") use.

For abbreviations, including acronyms, the use of _s_ without an apostrophe is now more common than its use with an apostrophe. Most modern style guides disparage the use of apostrophes in all plural abbreviations.

Some references continue to condone their use, or even recommend their use in some abbreviations. For example, _The Canadian Style_ states "Add an apostrophe and _s_ to form the plural of abbreviations containing more than one period", so _G.M.'s_ is preferred to _G.M.s_.[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-71) The _[Oxford Companion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford\_Companion "Oxford Companion") to the English Language_ condones [_V.I.P.'s_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_important_person "Very important person"), _VIP's_, and _VIPs_ equally.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-OxComp18-8)

#### Letters of the alphabet, and small words

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Apostrophe&action=edit&section=25 "Edit section: Letters of the alphabet, and small words")]

For single lowercase letters, pluralization with _'s_ is usual.[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-MW_apostrophe-72)[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-Garner_apostrophe-73)[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-Huddleston_apostrophe-74) Many guides recommend apostrophes whether the single letters are lowercase (as in "[minding your p's and q's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_your_Ps_and_Qs "Mind your Ps and Qs")") or uppercase (as in "A's and S's").[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-Hart_apostrophe-75)_[The Chicago Manual of Style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Chicago\_Manual\_of\_Style "The Chicago Manual of Style")_ recommends the apostrophe of plurality only for lowercase letters.[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-76) Sometimes, adding just _s_ rather than _'s_ may leave meaning ambiguous or presentation inelegant. However, an apostrophe is not always the preferred solution.[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-77)[APA style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APA_style "APA style") requires the use of italics instead of an apostrophe: _p_ s, _n_ s, etc.[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-78)

In the phrase _dos and don'ts_, most modern style guides disparage spelling the first word as _do's_. However, there is a lack of consensus and certainly the use of an apostrophe continues, legitimately, in which "the apostrophe of plurality occurs in the first word but not the second".[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-OxComp18-8)

#### Numbers and symbols

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Apostrophe&action=edit&section=26 "Edit section: Numbers and symbols")]

The _[Oxford Companion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford\_Companion "Oxford Companion") to the English Language_ notes that "a plural _s_ after a set of numbers is often preceded by an apostrophe, as in _3's and 4's_..., but many housestyles and individuals now favour _3s and 4s_".[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-OxComp18-8) Most style guides prefer the lack of apostrophe for groups of years (e.g. _1980s_)[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-owl-79) and will prefer _90s_ or _'90s_ over _90's_ or _'90's_.[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-80)[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-blog.apastyle.org2-81)

While many guides discourage using an apostrophe in all numbers/dates,[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-82) many other guides _encourage_ using an apostrophe for numbers or are divided on the issue; for example, the _Australian Government Style Manual_ recommends "Binary code uses 0’s and 1’s" but recommends "the 2020s".[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-83) Still other guides take a laissez-faire approach. For example, the University of Sussex's online guide notes regional variation in the use of apostrophes in dates,[[76]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-susx2-84) and slightly prefers _1's and 7's_ over _1s and 7s_ but condones both.

The apostrophe is very often used in plurals of symbols, for example "that page has too many &'s and #'s on it". Some style guides state that the apostrophe is unnecessary since there is no ambiguity but that some editors and teachers prefer this usage.[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-owl-79) The addition of an _s_ without an apostrophe may make the text difficult to read.[[76]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-susx2-84)

For many numbers and symbols, a useful alternative is to write out the numbers as words (e.g. _thousands_ instead of _1000s_ or _1000's_, and _ampersands_ instead of _&s_ or _&'s_).

The vast majority of English references published from the late 20th century onwards disparage the use of apostrophes in family-name plurals, for example identifying _Joneses_ as correct and _Jones's_ as incorrect. As an exception, the _[Oxford Companion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford\_Companion "Oxford Companion") to the English Language_ (2018) reports that, in addition to _Joneses_ etc., standard apostrophe usage does continue "in family names, especially if they end in _-s_, as in _[keeping up with the Jones's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keeping\_up\_with\_the\_Joneses "Keeping up with the Joneses")_".[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-OxComp18-8)

See [§Superfluous apostrophes ("greengrocers' apostrophes")](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#Superfluous_apostrophes_(%22greengrocers'_apostrophes%22)), below.

### Use in non-English names

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Apostrophe&action=edit&section=29 "Edit section: Use in non-English names")]

Names that are not strictly native to English sometimes have an apostrophe substituted to represent other characters (see also [As a mark of elision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#As_a_mark_of_elision), below).

*   Anglicised versions of [Irish surnames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_surnames "Irish surnames") typically contain an apostrophe after an _O_ (in place of [Ó](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%93#Irish "Ó")), for example "[Dara O'Briain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dara_%C3%93_Briain "Dara Ó Briain")" for _Dara Ó Bríain_.
*   Some [Scottish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Gaelic_name "Scottish Gaelic name") and [Irish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_name "Irish name") surnames use an apostrophe after an _M_, for example _M'Gregor_. The apostrophe here may be seen as marking a contraction where the prefix _Mc_ or _[Mac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish\_surname\_prefixes "Irish surname prefixes")_ would normally appear. However, it may also arise from a misinterpretation of printers' use of an inverted comma, ‘ (_turned comma_ or "6-quote"), as a substitute for superscript _c_ when printing with hand-set metal type. Compare: M'Lean, M c Lean, M‘Lean.[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-M'Culloch-85)

### Use in transliteration

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Apostrophe&action=edit&section=30 "Edit section: Use in transliteration")]

In [transliterated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transliteration "Transliteration") foreign words, an apostrophe may be used to separate letters or syllables that otherwise would likely be interpreted incorrectly. For example:

*   in the [Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_(language) "Arabic (language)") word _[mus'haf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mus%27haf "Mus'haf")_, a transliteration of مصحف, the syllables are as in _mus·haf_, not _mu·shaf_
*   in the Japanese name _[Shin'ichi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin%27ichi "Shin'ichi")_, the apostrophe shows that the pronunciation is _shi·n·i·chi_ ([hiragana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiragana "Hiragana")しんいち), where the letters _n_ (ん) and _i_ (い) are separate [morae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mora_(linguistics) "Mora (linguistics)"), rather than _shi·ni·chi_ (しにち).
*   in the Chinese [Pinyin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin "Pinyin") romanization, the apostrophe (', [隔音符號](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E9%9A%94%E9%9F%B3%E7%AC%A6%E8%99%9F "wikt:隔音符號"), géyīn fúhào, 'syllable-dividing mark') is used before a syllable starting with a vowel (_a_, _o_, or _e_) in a multiple-syllable word when the syllable does not start the word (which is most commonly realized as [ɰ]), unless the syllable immediately follows a [hyphen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen "Hyphen") or other dash.[[78]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-apostrophes-86) This is done to remove ambiguity that could arise, as in _[Xi'an](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi%27an "Xi'an")_, which consists of the two syllables _\_xi\__ ("西") _\_an\__ ("安"), compared to such words as _\_xian\__ ("先"). (This ambiguity does not occur when tone marks are used: The two tone marks in _\_Xīān\__ unambiguously show that the word consists of two syllables. However, even with tone marks, the city is usually spelled with an apostrophe as _\_Xī'ān\__.)

Furthermore, an apostrophe may be used to indicate a [glottal stop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glottal_stop "Glottal stop") in transliterations. For example:

*   in the Arabic word _[Qur'an](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qur%27an "Qur'an")_, a common transliteration of (part of) القرآن _al-qur'ān_, the apostrophe corresponds to the diacritic [maddah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_diacritics#Maddah "Arabic diacritics") over the ['alif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%27alif "'alif"), one of the letters in the [Arabic alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_alphabet "Arabic alphabet"). An ['alif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%27alif "'alif") by itself would indicate the long vowel [ā](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%80 "Ā"), and the maddah adds a glottal stop.

Rather than ʿ ([modifier letter left half ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modifier_letter_left_half_ring "Modifier letter left half ring")), the apostrophe is sometimes used to indicate a [voiced pharyngeal fricative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiced_pharyngeal_fricative "Voiced pharyngeal fricative") as it sounds and looks like the glottal stop to most English speakers. For example:

*   in the Arabic word _[Ka'aba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ka%27aba "Ka'aba")_ for الكعبة _al-kaʿbah_, the apostrophe corresponds to the Arabic letter [ʿayn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayin#Arabic_%CA%BFayn "Ayin").

Finally, in "scientific" transliteration of Cyrillic script, the apostrophe usually represents the [soft sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_sign "Soft sign")ь, though in "ordinary" transliteration it is usually omitted. For example,

*   "The [Ob River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ob_River "Ob River") (Russian: Обь), also Ob', is a major river in western Siberia."

Failure to observe standard use of the apostrophe is widespread and frequently criticised as incorrect,[[80]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-88)[[81]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-HoBS-89) often generating heated debate. The British founder of the [Apostrophe Protection Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe_Protection_Society "Apostrophe Protection Society") earned a 2001 [Ig Nobel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ig_Nobel "Ig Nobel") prize for "efforts to protect, promote and defend the differences between plural and possessive".[[82]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-90) A 2004 report by [British examination board OCR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCR_(examination_board) "OCR (examination board)") stated that "the inaccurate use of the apostrophe is so widespread as to be almost universal".[[83]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-91) A 2008 survey found that nearly half of the UK adults polled were unable to use the apostrophe correctly.[[81]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-HoBS-89)

#### Superfluous apostrophes ("greengrocers' apostrophes")

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Apostrophe&action=edit&section=32 "Edit section: Superfluous apostrophes (\"greengrocers' apostrophes\")")]

Apostrophes used in a non-standard manner to form [noun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noun "Noun")[plurals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plural "Plural") are known as _greengrocers' apostrophes_ or _grocers' apostrophes_, often written as _greengrocer's apostrophes_[[84]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-92) or _grocer's apostrophes_.[[85]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-93) They are sometimes humorously called _greengrocers apostrophe's_, _rogue apostrophes_, or _idiot's apostrophes_ (a literal translation of the [German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_grammar#Plurals "German grammar") word _Deppenapostroph_, which criticises the misapplication of apostrophes in [Denglisch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denglisch "Denglisch")). The practice, once common and acceptable (see _[Historical development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#Historical\_development)_), comes from the identical sound of the [plural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plural "Plural") and [possessive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Possessive_case "Possessive case") forms of most English [nouns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noun "Noun"). It is often criticised as a form of [hypercorrection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercorrection "Hypercorrection") coming from a widespread ignorance of the proper use of the apostrophe or of punctuation in general. [Lynne Truss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynne_Truss "Lynne Truss"), author of _[Eats, Shoots & Leaves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eats,\_Shoots\_%26\_Leaves "Eats, Shoots & Leaves")_, points out that before the 19th century it was standard orthography to use the apostrophe to form a plural of a foreign-sounding word that ended in a vowel (e.g., banana's, folio's, logo's, quarto's, pasta's, ouzo's) to clarify pronunciation. Truss says this usage is no longer considered proper in formal writing.[[86]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-94)

The term is believed to have been coined in the middle of the 20th century by a teacher of languages working in [Liverpool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool "Liverpool"), at a time when such mistakes were common in the handwritten signs and advertisements of [greengrocers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greengrocer "Greengrocer") (e.g., _Apple's [1/-](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shilling "Shilling") a pound, Orange's 1/6[d](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penny "Penny") a pound_). Some have argued that its use in mass communication by employees of well-known companies has led to the less literate assuming it to be standard and adopting the habit themselves.[[87]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-95)

The same use of apostrophe before [noun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noun "Noun")[plural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plural "Plural") -s forms is sometimes made by non-native speakers of English. For example, in [Dutch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_grammar#Plural "Dutch grammar"), the apostrophe is inserted before the _s_ when pluralising most words ending in a vowel or _y_ for example, _baby's_ (English _babies_) and _radio's_ (English _radios_). This often produces so-called "[Dunglish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunglish "Dunglish")" errors when carried over into English.[[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-96)[Hyperforeignism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperforeignism "Hyperforeignism") has been formalised in some pseudo-[anglicisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglicism "Anglicism"). For example, the French word _[pin's](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/pin%27s "fr:pin's")_ (from English _pin_) is used (with the apostrophe in both singular and plural) for [collectible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collectible "Collectible")[lapel pins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lapel_pin "Lapel pin"). Similarly, there is an [Andorran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andorra "Andorra") football club called [FC Rànger's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_R%C3%A0nger%27s "FC Rànger's") (after such British clubs as [Rangers F.C.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rangers_F.C. "Rangers F.C.")) and a Japanese dance group called [Super Monkey's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Monkey%27s "Super Monkey's").

In the UK there is a tendency to drop apostrophes in many commonly used names such as [St Annes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lytham_St_Annes "Lytham St Annes"), St Johns Lane,[[89]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-97) and so on.

UK supermarket chain [Tesco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesco "Tesco") omits the mark where standard practice would require it. Signs in Tesco advertise (among other items) "mens magazines", "girls toys", "kids books" and "womens shoes". In his book _[Troublesome Words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryson%27s\_Dictionary\_of\_Troublesome\_Words "Bryson's Dictionary of Troublesome Words")_, author [Bill Bryson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Bryson "Bill Bryson") lambasts Tesco for this, stating that "the mistake is inexcusable, and those who make it are linguistic [Neanderthals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neanderthals_in_popular_culture "Neanderthals in popular culture")."[[90]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-98)

The [United States Board on Geographic Names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Board_on_Geographic_Names "United States Board on Geographic Names") discourages the use of possessive apostrophes in geographic names (see [above](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#Possessives_in_geographic_names)),[[91]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-99) though state agencies do not always conform; Vermont's official state website provides information concerning [Camel's Hump State Forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel%27s_Hump_State_Forest "Camel's Hump State Forest").[[92]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-100)

The Geographical Names Board of [New South Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales "New South Wales"), Australia, excludes possessive apostrophes from place names, along with other punctuation.[[93]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-101)

[George Bernard Shaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Bernard_Shaw "George Bernard Shaw"), a proponent of [English spelling reform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English-language_spelling_reform "English-language spelling reform") on phonetic principles, argued that the apostrophe was mostly redundant. He did not use it for spelling _cant_, _hes_, etc., in many of his writings. He did, however, allow _I'm_ and _it's_.[[94]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-102)[Hubert Selby Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_Selby_Jr. "Hubert Selby Jr.") used a slash instead of an apostrophe mark for contractions and did not use an apostrophe at all for possessives. [Lewis Carroll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Carroll "Lewis Carroll") made greater use of apostrophes, and frequently used _sha'n't_, with an apostrophe in place of the elided _ll_ as well as the more usual _o_.[[95]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-103)[[96]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-104) These authors' usages have not become widespread.

The British pop group [Hear'Say](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hear%27Say "Hear'Say") famously made unconventional use of an apostrophe in its name. Truss comments that "the naming of Hear'Say in 2001 was... a significant milestone on the road to punctuation anarchy".[[97]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-105)

Over the years, the use of apostrophes has been criticised. George Bernard Shaw called them "uncouth bacilli", referring to the apostrophe-like shape of many [bacteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacillus "Bacillus"). The author and language commentator [Anu Garg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anu_Garg "Anu Garg") has called for the abolition of the apostrophe, stating "Some day this world would be free of metastatic cancers, narcissistic con men, and the apostrophe."[[98]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-wordsmith-106) In his book _American Speech_, linguist Steven Byington stated of the apostrophe that "the language would be none the worse for its abolition". Adrian Room, in his _[English Journal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English\_Journal "English Journal")_ article "Axing the Apostrophe", argued that apostrophes are unnecessary, and context will resolve any ambiguity.[[99]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-about-107) In a letter to the _English Journal_, Peter Brodie stated that apostrophes are "largely decorative ... [and] rarely clarify meaning".[[100]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-108)[John C. Wells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_C._Wells "John C. Wells"), emeritus professor of phonetics at [University College London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_College_London "University College London"), says the apostrophe is "a waste of time".[[101]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-109) The Apostrophe Protection Society, founded by retired journalist John Richards in 2001, was brought to a full stop in 2019, after a period of 18 years in activity. Concerning that, Richards—then aged 96, and dashed by its unsuccess—exclaimed that "the ignorance and laziness present in modern times have won!"[[102]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-110)

In a _[Chronicle of Higher Education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronicle\_of\_Higher\_Education "Chronicle of Higher Education")_ blog, [Geoffrey Pullum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Pullum "Geoffrey Pullum") proposed that the apostrophe be considered the 27th letter of the alphabet, arguing that it is not a form of [punctuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punctuation "Punctuation").[[103]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-111)

### As a mark of elision

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Apostrophe&action=edit&section=37 "Edit section: As a mark of elision")]

In many languages, especially European languages, the apostrophe is used to indicate the [elision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elision "Elision") of one or more sounds, as in English.

*   In [Albanian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_language "Albanian language"), the apostrophe is used to show that a vowel has been omitted from words, especially in different forms of verbs and in some forms of personal pronoun. For example, _t'i_: them (from _të + i_: them), _m'i mori_ (from _më + i mori_). It is used too in some of the forms of possessive pronouns, for example: _s'ëmës_ (from _së ëmës_).
*   In [Afrikaans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afrikaans "Afrikaans"), as in Dutch, the apostrophe is used to show that letters have been omitted from words. The most common use is in the indefinite article _'n_, which is a contraction of _een_ meaning 'one' (the number). As the initial _e_ is omitted and cannot be capitalised, the second word in a sentence that begins with _'n_ is capitalised instead. For example: _'n Boom is groen_, 'A tree is green'. In addition, the apostrophe is used for plurals and diminutives where the root ends with long [vowels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel "Vowel"), e.g. _foto's_, _taxi's_, _Lulu's_, _Lulu'tjie_, etc.[[104]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-112)
*   In [Catalan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_language "Catalan language"), [French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language "French language"), [Italian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_language "Italian language"), [Ligurian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligurian_(Romance_language) "Ligurian (Romance language)"), and [Occitan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occitan_language "Occitan language") word sequences such as _[(coup) d'état](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup\_d%27%C3%A9tat "Coup d'état")_, _[(maître) d'hôtel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ma%C3%AEtre\_d%27h%C3%B4tel "Maître d'hôtel")_ (often shortened to _maître d'_, when used in English), _[L'Aquila](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27Aquila "L'Aquila")_, _[L'Alpe d'Huez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpe\_d%27Huez "Alpe d'Huez")_ and _[L'Hospitalet de Llobregat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27Hospitalet\_de\_Llobregat "L'Hospitalet de Llobregat")_ the final vowel in the first word (_de_ 'of', _le_ 'the', etc.) is elided because the word that follows it starts with a vowel or a [mute h](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H "H"). [French elision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elision_(French) "Elision (French)") similarly occurs with _qu'il_ instead of _que il_ ('that he'), _c'est_ instead of _ce est_ ('it is' / 'it's'), and so on. Catalan, French, Italian, and Occitan surnames sometimes contain apostrophes of elision, e.g. _d’Alembert_, _D'Angelo_. 
    *   French feminine singular [possessive adjectives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Possessive_adjective "Possessive adjective") do not undergo such elision anymore, but change to the masculine form instead: _\_ma\__ preceding _\_église\__ becomes _\_mon église\__ ('my church').[[note 9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-113)
    *   [Quebec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec "Quebec")'s [Bill 101](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_101 "Bill 101"), which dictates the use of [French in the province](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec_French "Quebec French"), prohibits the use of apostrophes in proper names in which it would not be used in proper French (thus the international donut chain [Tim Hortons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Hortons "Tim Hortons"), originally spelled with the possessive apostrophe as Tim Horton's, was required to drop the apostrophe in Quebec to comply with Bill 101).[[105]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-114)

*   In [Danish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danish_language "Danish language"), apostrophes are sometimes seen on [commercial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising "Advertising") materials. One might commonly see _Ta' mig med_ ('Take me with [you]') next to a stand with advertisement leaflets; that would be written _Tag mig med_ in standard orthography. As in German, the apostrophe must not be used to indicate the possessive, except when there is already an _s_, _x_ or _z_ present in the base form, as in _Esajas' bog_ ('the Book of Esajas').
*   In [Dutch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_language "Dutch language"), as in Afrikaans, the apostrophe is used to indicate omitted characters. For example, the indefinite article _een_ can be shortened to _'n_, and the definite article _het_ shortened to _'t_. When this happens in the first word of a sentence, the _second_ word of the sentence is capitalised. In general, this way of using the apostrophe is considered non-standard, except as _[genitivus temporalis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genitive\_case "Genitive case")_ in _'s morgens_, _'s middags_, _'s avonds_, _'s nachts_ (for _des morgens, des middags, des avonds, des nachts_, 'at morning, at afternoon, at evening, at night') and in some frozen place names such as _['s-Hertogenbosch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%27s-Hertogenbosch "'s-Hertogenbosch")_ ([possessive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Possessive "Possessive"), lit. "The [Duke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke "Duke")'s forest"), _'s-Gravenhage_ (traditional name of [The Hague](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hague "The Hague"), lit. "The [Count](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count "Count")'s hedge"), _'s-Gravenbrakel_ ([Braine-le-Comte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braine-le-Comte "Braine-le-Comte"), in Belgium), _'s-Hertogenrade_ ([Herzogenrath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herzogenrath "Herzogenrath"), in Germany), etc. In addition, the apostrophe is used for plurals where the singulars end with long [vowels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel "Vowel"), e.g. _foto's_, _taxi's_; and for the genitive of proper names ending with these vowels, e.g. _Anna's_, _Otto's_. These are in fact elided vowels; use of the apostrophe prevents spellings like _fotoos_ and _Annaas_. However, most [diminutives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminutive "Diminutive") do not use an apostrophe where the plural forms would; producing spellings such as _fotootje_ and _taxietje_.
*   In [Esperanto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto "Esperanto"), the [Fundamento](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamento_de_Esperanto "Fundamento de Esperanto") limits the elision mark to the definite article _l'_ (from _la_) and singular nominative nouns (_kor'_ from _koro_, 'heart'). This is mostly confined to poetry and songs. Idiomatic phrases such as _dank' al_ (from _(kun) danko al_, 'thanks to') and _del'_ (from _de la_ 'of the') are nonetheless frequent. In-word elision is usually marked with a [hyphen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen "Hyphen"), as in _D-ro_ (from _doktoro_, 'Dr'). Some early guides used and advocated the use of apostrophes between word parts, to aid recognition of such [compound words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_word "Compound word") as _gitar'ist'o_, 'guitarist'; but in the latter case, modern usage is to use either a hyphen or a middle dot when disambiguation is necessary, as in _ĉas-hundo_ or _ĉas·hundo_, "a hunting dog", not to be mispronounced as _ĉa.ŝun.do_.
*   In Finnish, the apostrophe is used in inflected forms of words whose basic form has a "k" between similar vowels, to show that the "k" has elided in the inflected form: for example the word _\_raaka\__ ("raw") becomes _\_raa'at\__ in the plural. The apostrophe shows that the identical vowels on either side of it belong to different syllables.
*   The [Galician language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galician_language "Galician language") standard admits the use of the apostrophe (_apóstrofo_) for contractions that normally do not use it (e.g.: de + a= da), when the second element begins a proper noun, generally a title: _o argumento d'A Esmorga_ (the plot of A Esmorga [title of a novel]).[[106]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-115) They are also used to reproduce oral elisions and, as stated below, to join (or split) commercial names of popular public establishments such as restaurants (_O'Pote_, The pot).
*   In [Ganda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luganda "Luganda"), when a word ending with a [vowel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel "Vowel") is followed by a word beginning with a vowel, the final vowel of the first word is [elided](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elision "Elision") and the initial vowel of the second word [lengthened](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel_length "Vowel length") in compensation. When the first word is a [monosyllable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monosyllable "Monosyllable"), this elision is represented in the orthography with an apostrophe: in _\_taata w'abaana\__ 'the father of the children', _\_wa\__ ('of') becomes _w_'; in _\_y'ani?\__ ('who is it?'), _\_ye\__ ('who') becomes _y'_. But the final vowel of a [polysyllable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysyllable "Polysyllable") is always written, even if it is elided in speech: _\_omusajja oyo\__ ('this man'), not *_\_omusajj'oyo\__, because _\_omusajja\__ ('man') is a polysyllable.
*   In German an apostrophe is used almost exclusively to indicate omitted letters. It must not be used for plurals or most of the possessive forms. The only exceptions are the possessive cases of names ending in an "s"-sound as in _\_Max' Vater\__, or "to prevent ambiguities" in all other possessive cases of names, as in _\_Andrea's Blumenladen\__ (referring to the female name _\_Andrea\__, not the male name _\_Andreas\__). The English/Saxon style of using an apostrophe for possession was introduced after the spelling reform, but is strongly disagreed on by native speakers, and discouraged. Although possessive usage (beyond the exceptions) is widespread, it is often deemed incorrect. The German equivalent of "greengrocers' apostrophes" would be the derogatory _\_Deppenapostroph\__ ('idiot's apostrophe'; see the article [Apostrophitis](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophitis "de:Apostrophitis") in German Wikipedia).
*    In modern printings of [Ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek "Ancient Greek"), apostrophes are also used to mark elision. Some Ancient Greek words that end in short vowels elide when the next word starts with a vowel. For example, many Ancient Greek authors would write δἄλλος (_\_d'állos\__) for δὲ ἄλλος (_\_dè állos\__) and ἆροὐ (_\_âr' ou\__) for ἆρα οὐ (_\_âra ou\__). Such modern usage should be carefully distinguished from [polytonic Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytonic_orthography "Polytonic orthography")'s native [rough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rough_breathing "Rough breathing") and [smooth breathing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_breathing "Smooth breathing") marks, which usually appear as a form of rounded apostrophe.
*   In [Hebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language "Hebrew language"), the _[geresh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geresh "Geresh")_ (׳), often typed as an apostrophe, is used to denote abbreviations. A double _geresh_ (״), known by the dual form [gershayim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gershayim "Gershayim"), is used to denote [acronyms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acronym "Acronym") or [initialisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initialism "Initialism"); it is inserted before (i.e., to the right of) the last letter of the acronym. Examples: פרופ׳ (abbreviation for פרופסור, 'professor', '[professor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor "Professor")'); נ״ב (_\_nun-bet\__, '[P.S.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postscript "Postscript")'). The _geresh_ is also used to indicate the elision of a sound; however, this use is much less frequent, and confined to the purpose of imitating a natural, informal utterance, for example: אנ׳לא (_\_anlo\__ – short for אני לא, _\_ani lo\__, 'I am/do not').
*   In Irish, the past tense of verbs beginning with a vowel, or with _fh_ followed by a vowel, begins with _d'_(elision of _do_), for example _do oscail_ becomes _d'oscail_ ('opened') and _do fhill_ becomes _d'fhill_ ('returned'). The [copula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copula_(linguistics) "Copula (linguistics)")_is_ is often elided to _'s_, and _do_ ('to'), _mo_ ('my') etc. are elided before _f_ and vowels.
*   In [Italian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_language "Italian language") it is used for elision with pronouns, as in _l'ha_ instead of _la ha_; with articles, as in _l'opera_ instead of _la opera_; and for truncation, as in _po'_ instead of _poco_. Stylistically, sentences beginning with È (as in _È vero che ..._) are often rendered as E' in newspapers, to minimise [leading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leading "Leading") (inter-line spacing).
*   In modern [Norwegian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_language "Norwegian language"), the apostrophe marks that a word has been contracted, such as _\_ha'kke\__ from _\_har ikke\__ ('have/has not'). Unlike English and French, such elisions are not accepted as part of standard orthography but are used to create a more "oral style" in writing. The apostrophe is also used to mark the genitive for words that end in an -s sound: words ending in -s, -x, and -z, some speakers also including words ending in the sound [[ʂ]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Norwegian "Help:IPA/Norwegian"). As Norwegian does not form the plural with -s, there is no need to distinguish between an -s forming the possessive and the -s forming the plural. Therefore, we have _\_mann\__ ('man') and _\_manns\__ ('man's'), without apostrophe, but _\_los\__ ('naval pilot') and _\_los\_'_ ('naval pilot's'). Indicating the possessive for the two former American presidents named George Bush, whose names end in [[ʂ]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Norwegian "Help:IPA/Norwegian"), could be written as both _\_Bushs\__ (simply adding an -s to the name) and _\_Bush'\__ (adding an apostrophe to the end of the name).[_[clarification needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please\_clarify "Wikipedia:Please clarify")_]
*   In [Portuguese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_language "Portuguese language") the apostrophe is used to reproduce certain popular pronunciations such as _s'enxerga_ (pay attention to yourself) or in a few combinations of word, when there is the suppression of the vowel of the preposition _de_ in certain compound words (the ones formed by two or more stems) such as _caixa-d'água_ ('water tower'), _galinha-d'angola_ ('guineafowl'), _pau-d'alho_ (a plant species, _Gallesia integrifolia_), _estrela-d'alva_ ('morning star'), etc. The apostrophe is most commonly not used in the word _pra_, the reduced or popular form of the preposition _para,_ but some advocate for its used in preposition + article contractions: _para + a = p'ra/pra_, _para + o = p'ro/pro_, etc.[[107]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-116).
*   Modern Spanish no longer uses the apostrophe to indicate elision in standard writing, although it can sometimes be found in older poetry for that purpose.[[note 10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-117) Instead Spanish writes out the spoken elision in full (_\_de enero\__, _\_mi hijo\__) except for the contraction _\_del\__ for _\_de\__ + _\_el\__, and _al_ for _a_ + _el_, which use no apostrophe.
*   In [Swedish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_(language) "Swedish (language)"), the apostrophe marks an elision, such as _\_på sta'n\__, short for _\_på staden\__ ('in the city'), to make the text more similar to the spoken language. This is relaxed style, fairly rarely used, and would not be used by traditional newspapers in political articles, but could be used in entertainment related articles and similar. The formal way to denote elision in Swedish is by using colon, e.g. _\_S:t Erik\__ for _\_Sankt Erik\__ which is rarely spelled out in full. The apostrophe must not be used to indicate the possessive except – although not mandatory – when there is already an _s_, _x_ or _z_ present in the base form, as in _\_Lukas' bok\__.
*   [Welsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_language "Welsh language") uses the apostrophe to mark elision of the definite article _yr_ ('the') following a vowel (_a_, _e_, _i_, _o_, _u_, _y_, or, in Welsh, _w_), as in _i'r tŷ_, 'to the house'. It is also used with the particle _yn_, such as with _mae hi'n_, 'she is'.

Several languages and transliteration systems use the apostrophe or some similar mark to indicate a [glottal stop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glottal_stop "Glottal stop"), sometimes considering it a letter of the alphabet:

*   In several [Finno-Ugric languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finno-Ugric_languages "Finno-Ugric languages"), such as [Estonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estonian_language "Estonian language") and [Finnish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnish_language "Finnish language"); for example in the Finnish word _\_raa’an\__, being the genitive or accusative of _\_raaka\__ ('raw').
*   In [Guarani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guaran%C3%AD_language "Guaraní language"), it is called _\_puso\__/puˈso/, and used in the words _\_ñe'ẽ\__ (language, to speak), _\_ka'a\__ (grass), _\_a'ỹ\__ (sterile).
*   In [Hawaiian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaiian_language "Hawaiian language"), the _[ʻokina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CA%BBokina "ʻokina")_⟨ʻ⟩, an inverted apostrophe, is often rendered as ⟨'⟩. It is considered a letter of the alphabet.
*   [Mayan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayan_language "Mayan language").
*   In the [Tongan language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongan_language "Tongan language"), the apostrophe is called a _\_fakauʻa\__ and is the last letter of the alphabet. It represents the glottal stop. Like the ʻokina, it is inverted.
*   Various other [Austronesian languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austronesian_languages "Austronesian languages"), such as [Samoan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samoan_language "Samoan language"), [Tahitian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tahitian_language "Tahitian language"), and [Chamorro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamorro_language "Chamorro language").
*   [Tetum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetum_language "Tetum language"), one of the official languages of [East Timor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor "East Timor").
*   The Brazilian native [Tupi language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupi_language "Tupi language").
*   [Mossi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mossi_language "Mossi language") (Mooré), a language of [Burkina Faso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burkina_Faso "Burkina Faso").
*   In [Võro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C3%B5ro_language "Võro language"), the apostrophe is used in parallel with the letter _q_ as symbol of plural, for example _majaq_ or _maja'_ ('houses'), imperative _annaq_ or _anna'_, and in all other word forms with glottal stop.
*   Several [fictional languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_languages "Fictional languages") such as [Klingon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klingon_language "Klingon language"), [D'ni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%27ni_language "D'ni language"), [Mando'a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mando%27a "Mando'a") or [Na'vi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Na%27vi_language "Na'vi language") add apostrophes to make names appear "alien".

The apostrophe represents sounds resembling the glottal stop in the [Turkic languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkic_languages "Turkic languages") and in some [romanizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization "Romanization") of [Semitic languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semitic_languages "Semitic languages"), including [Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language "Arabic language") and [Hebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language "Hebrew language"). In that case, the letter _['ayn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayin "Ayin")_ (Arabic ع and Hebrew ע) is correspondingly transliterated with the opening single quotation mark.

### As a mark of palatalization or non-palatalization

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Apostrophe&action=edit&section=39 "Edit section: As a mark of palatalization or non-palatalization")]

Some languages and [transliteration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transliteration "Transliteration") systems use the apostrophe to mark the presence, or the lack of, [palatalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palatalization_(phonetics) "Palatalization (phonetics)"):

*   In [Belarusian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belarusian_language "Belarusian language") and [Ukrainian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_language "Ukrainian language"), the apostrophe is used between a consonant and a following "soft" ([iotated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iotation "Iotation")) vowel (Be.: [е](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%95 "Е"), [ё](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%81 "Ё"), [ю](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%AE "Ю"), [я](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%AF "Я"); Uk.: [є](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%84 "Є"), [ї](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%87 "Ї"), [ю](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%AE "Ю"), [я](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%AF "Я")) to indicate that _no_ palatalization of the preceding consonant takes place, and the vowel is pronounced in the same way as at the beginning of a word. It therefore marks a morpheme boundary before /j/ and, in Belarusian, is a letter of the alphabet (as the hard sign in Russian is) rather than a simple punctuation mark in English, as it is not a punctuation mark in Belarusian. It appears frequently in Ukrainian, as, for instance, in the words: ⟨п'ять⟩ (_p"jat'_) 'five', ⟨від'їзд⟩ (_vid"jizd_) 'departure', ⟨об'єднаний⟩ (_ob"jednanyj_) 'united', ⟨з'ясувати⟩ (_z"jasuvaty_) 'to clear up, explain', ⟨п'єса⟩ (_p"jesa_) play (drama), etc.[[108]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-118)[[109]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-119)
*   In [Russian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language "Russian language") and some derived alphabets, the same function has been served by the [hard sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_sign "Hard sign") (ъ, formerly called _yer_). But the apostrophe saw some use as a substitute after 1918, when Soviet authorities enforced an orthographic reform by confiscating [movable type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movable_type "Movable type") bearing the hard sign from stubborn printing houses in Petrograd.[[110]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-120)
*   In some [Latin transliterations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_transliteration "Latin transliteration") of certain [Cyrillic alphabets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrillic_alphabets "Cyrillic alphabets") (for [Belarusian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belarusian_language "Belarusian language"), [Russian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Russian "Romanization of Russian"), and [Ukrainian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_language "Ukrainian language")), the apostrophe is used to replace the [soft sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_sign "Soft sign") (ь, indicating palatalization of the preceding consonant), e.g., _Русь_ is transliterated _[Rus'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kievan\_Rus%27 "Kievan Rus'")_ according to the [BGN/PCGN system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BGN/PCGN_system "BGN/PCGN system"). (The [prime symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_(symbol)#Use_in_linguistics "Prime (symbol)") is also used for the same purpose.) Some of these transliteration schemes use a [double apostrophe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modifier_letter_double_apostrophe "Modifier letter double apostrophe") (ˮ) to represent the apostrophe in Ukrainian and Belarusian text and the hard sign (ъ) in Russian text, e.g. Ukrainian _слов'янське_ ('Slavic') is transliterated as _\_slov"jans'ke\__.
*   Some [Karelian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karelian_language "Karelian language") orthographies use an apostrophe to indicate palatalization, e.g. _\_n'evvuo\__ ('to give advice'), _\_d'uuri\__ ('just (like)'), _\_el'vüttiä\__ ('to revive').
*   In [Võro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C3%B5ro_language "Võro language") an apostrophe is often (also in the Võro Wikipedia) used as a simplification to replace the regular Võro palatalization mark which is the accute accent, for example _as'aq_ replacing regular form _aśaq_ ('things').

### To separate morphemes

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Apostrophe&action=edit&section=40 "Edit section: To separate morphemes")]

Some languages use the apostrophe to separate the [root](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_(linguistics) "Root (linguistics)") of a word and its [affixes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affix "Affix"), especially if the root is foreign and unassimilated. (For another kind of morphemic separation see [pinyin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#Miscellaneous_uses_in_other_languages), below.)

*   In [Danish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danish_language "Danish language") an apostrophe is sometimes used to join the [enclitic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enclitic "Enclitic")[definite article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definite_article "Definite article") to words of foreign origin, or to other words that would otherwise look awkward. For example, one would write _\_IP'en\__ to mean "the [IP address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address "IP address")". There is some variation in what is considered "awkward enough" to warrant an apostrophe; for instance, long-established words such as _\_firma\__ ('company') or _\_niveau\__ ('level') might be written _\_firma'et\__ and _\_niveau'et\__, but will generally be seen without an apostrophe. Due to Danish influence, this usage of the apostrophe can also be seen in Norwegian, but is non-standard – a hyphen should be used instead: e.g. _CD-en_ (the CD).
*   In [Estonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estonian_language "Estonian language"), apostrophes can be used in the declension of some foreign names to separate the stem from any [declension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declension "Declension") endings; e.g., _\_Monet'\__ ([genitive case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genitive_case "Genitive case")) or _\_Monet'sse\__ ([illative case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illative_case "Illative case")) of _Monet_ (name of the famous painter).
*   In [Finnish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnish_language "Finnish language"), apostrophes are used in the declension of foreign names or loan words that end in a consonant when written but are pronounced with a vowel ending, e.g. _\_show'ssa\__ ('in a show'), _\_Bordeaux'hon\__ ('to Bordeaux'). For Finnish as well as [Swedish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_language "Swedish language"), there is a closely related [use of the colon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation)#Suffix_separator "Colon (punctuation)").
*   In [Polish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_language "Polish language"), the apostrophe is used exclusively for marking inflections of words and word-like elements (but not [acronyms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acronym "Acronym") – a hyphen is used instead) whose spelling conflicts with the normal rules of inflection. This mainly affects foreign words and names. For instance, one would correctly write _\_Kampania Ala Gore'a\__ for "[Al Gore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Gore "Al Gore")'s campaign". In this example, _\_Ala\__ is spelled without an apostrophe, since its spelling and pronunciation fit into normal Polish rules; but _\_Gore'a\__ needs the apostrophe, because _e_ disappears from the pronunciation, changing the inflection pattern. This rule is often misunderstood as calling for an apostrophe after _all_ foreign words, regardless of their pronunciation, yielding the incorrect _\_Kampania Al'a Gore'a\__, for example. The effect is akin to the greengrocers' apostrophe (see above).
*   In [Turkish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_language "Turkish language"), [proper nouns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noun#Proper_nouns_and_common_nouns "Noun") are capitalised and an apostrophe is inserted between the noun and any following [inflectional suffix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflectional_suffix "Inflectional suffix"), e.g. _\_İstanbul'da\__ ("in [Istanbul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istanbul "Istanbul")"), contrasting with _\_okulda\__ ("in school", _\_okul\__ is a common noun) and _\_İstanbullu\__ ('Istanbulite', _-lu_ is a [derivational suffix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivational_suffix "Derivational suffix")).[[111]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-121)
*   In [Welsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_language "Welsh language") the apostrophe is used with infixed pronouns in order to distinguish them from the preceding word (e.g. _\_a'm chwaer\__, 'and my sister' as opposed to _\_am chwaer\__, 'about a sister').

### Miscellaneous uses in other languages

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Apostrophe&action=edit&section=41 "Edit section: Miscellaneous uses in other languages")]

*   In [Breton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breton_language "Breton language"), the combination _\_cʼh\__ is used for the consonant /x/ (like _ch_ in [Scottish English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_English "Scottish English")_Loch Ness_), while _\_ch\__ is used for the consonant /ʃ/ (as in French _\_chat\__ or English _she_).
*   In [Czech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_language "Czech language"), an apostrophe is used for writing to indicate spoken or informal language where the writer wants to express the natural way of informal speech, but it should not be used in formal text or text of a serious nature. E.g., instead of _\_četl\__ ('he read'), the word form _\_čet'\__ is used. _\_Čet'\__ is the informal variant of the verb form _\_četl\__, at least in some varieties.[[112]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-122) These two words are the same in meaning, but to use the informal form gives the text a more natural tone, as though a friend were talking to you. Furthermore, the same as in the Slovak case below holds for lowercase _t_ and _d_, and for the two-digit year notation.
*   In [Finnish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnish_language "Finnish language"), one of the [consonant gradation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consonant_gradation "Consonant gradation") patterns is the change of a _k_ into a [hiatus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiatus_(linguistics) "Hiatus (linguistics)"), e.g. _\_keko\__ → _\_keon\__ ('a pile' → 'a pile's'). This hiatus has to be indicated in spelling with an apostrophe if a long vowel (represented by doubling (e.g. _oo_) or the final vowel of a diphthong (e.g. _uo_) would be immediately followed by the same vowel, e.g. _\_ruoko\__ → _\_ruo'on\__, _\_vaaka\__ → _\_vaa'an\__. (This is in contrast to compound words, where the problem of a vowel recurring over a syllable break is solved with a [hyphen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen "Hyphen"), e.g. _\_maa-ala\__, 'land area'.) Similarly, the apostrophe is used to mark the [hiatus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiatus_(linguistics) "Hiatus (linguistics)") (contraction) that occurs in poetry, e.g. _\_miss' on\__ for _\_missä on\__ ('where is').
*   [Galician restaurants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galician_cuisine "Galician cuisine") sometimes use _'_ in their names following the standard article _\_O\__ ('the').[[113]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-123)
*   In [Ganda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luganda "Luganda"), _\_ng'\__ (pronounced /ŋ/) is used in place of _ŋ_ on keyboards where this character is not available. The apostrophe distinguishes it from the letter combination _\_ng\__ (pronounced [ŋɡ]), which has separate use in the language. Compare this with the Swahili usage below.
*   In [Hebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language "Hebrew language"), the _[geresh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geresh "Geresh")_ (a diacritic similar to the apostrophe and often represented by one) is used for several purposes other than to mark an elision: 
    *   As an adjacent to letters to show sounds that are not represented in the [Hebrew alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_alphabet "Hebrew alphabet"): Sounds such as /[dʒ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiced_postalveolar_affricate "Voiced postalveolar affricate")/ (English _j_ as in _job_), /[θ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiceless_dental_fricative "Voiceless dental fricative")/ (English _th_ as in _thigh_), and /[tʃ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiceless_postalveolar_affricate "Voiceless postalveolar affricate")/ (English _ch_ as in _check_) are indicated using ג, ת, and צ with a _[geresh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geresh "Geresh")_ (informally _chupchik_). For example, the name _George_ is spelled ג׳ורג׳ in Hebrew (with ג׳ representing the first and last consonants).
    *   To denote a [Hebrew numeral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_numerals "Hebrew numerals") (e.g., נ׳, which stands for '50')
    *   To denote a Hebrew letter which stands for itself (e.g., מ׳ – the letter _[mem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mem "Mem")_)
    *   [Gershayim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gershayim "Gershayim") (a double geresh) to denote a Hebrew letter name (e.g., למ״ד – the letter _[lamed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamed "Lamed")_)
    *   Another (rarer) use of geresh is to denote the last syllable (which in some cases, but not all, is a [suffix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffix "Suffix")) in some words of [Yiddish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yiddish "Yiddish")[origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etymology "Etymology") (e.g., חבר׳ה, מיידל׳ה).
    *   In the [Middle Ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages "Middle Ages") and the [Early modern period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_modern_period "Early modern period"), gershayim were also used to denote foreign words, as well as a means of [emphasis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emphasis_(typography) "Emphasis (typography)").

*   In Italian, an apostrophe is sometimes used as a substitute for a [grave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grave_accent "Grave accent") or an [acute accent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_accent "Acute accent"). This may be done after an initial E or an accented final vowel (when writing in all-capitals), or when the proper form of the letter is unavailable for technical reasons. So a sentence beginning _È vero che ..._ ('It is true that...') may be written as _E' vero che ..._. This form is often seen in newspapers, as it is the only case of an accent above the [cap height](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_height "Cap height") and its omission permits the text to be more closely spaced ([leading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leading "Leading")). Less commonly, a forename like _Niccolò_ might be rendered as _Niccolo'_, or _NICCOLO'_; _perché_, as _perche'_, or _PERCHE'_. This applies only to machine or computer writing, in the absence of a suitable keyboard.
*   In [Jèrriais](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%A8rriais "Jèrriais"), one of the uses of the apostrophe is to mark [gemination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemination "Gemination"), or consonant length: For example, _\_t't\__ represents /tː/, _\_s's\__/sː/, _\_n'n\__/nː/, _\_th'th\__/ðː/, and _\_ch'ch\__/ʃː/ (contrasted with /t/, /s/, /n/, /ð/, and /ʃ/).
*   In [Lithuanian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_language "Lithuanian language"), the apostrophe is occasionally used to add a Lithuanized ending on an international word, e.g.- "parking'as", "Skype'as", "Facebook'as".
*   In standard [Lojban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lojban "Lojban") orthography, the apostrophe is a letter in its own right (called _y'y_[əhə]) that can appear only between two vowels, and is phonemically realised as either [[h](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiceless_glottal_fricative "Voiceless glottal fricative")] or, more rarely, [[θ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiceless_dental_fricative "Voiceless dental fricative")].
*   In [Macedonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedonian_language "Macedonian language") the apostrophe is sometimes used to represent the sound [schwa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwa "Schwa"), which can be found on dialectal levels, but not in the Standard Macedonian.
*   In [Slovak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovak_language "Slovak language"), the [caron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caron "Caron") over lowercase _t_, _d_, _l_, and uppercase _L_[consonants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consonants "Consonants") resembles an apostrophe, for example, _ď_, _ť_, _ľ_, and _Ľ_. This is especially so in certain common typographic renderings. But it is non-standard to use an apostrophe instead of the caron. There is also _l_ with an acute accent: _ĺ_, _Ĺ_. In Slovak the apostrophe is properly used only to indicate [elision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elision "Elision") in certain words (_\_tys'\__, as an abbreviated form of _\_ty si\__ ('you are'), or _\_hor'\__ for _\_hore\__ ('up')); however, these elisions are restricted to poetry (with a few exceptions). Moreover, the apostrophe is also used before a two-digit year number (to indicate the omission of the first two digits): _\_'87\__ (usually used for 1987).
*   In [Swahili](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swahili_language "Swahili language"), an apostrophe after _\_ng\__ shows that there is no sound of /ɡ/ after the /ŋ/ sound; that is, that the _\_ng\__ is pronounced as in English _singer_, not as in English _finger_.
*   In Switzerland, the apostrophe is used as [thousands separator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thousands_separator "Thousands separator") alongside the [fixed space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_space "Fixed space") (e.g., 2'000'000 or 2 000 000 for two million) in all four [national languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_Switzerland "Languages of Switzerland").
*   In the new [Uzbek Latin alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uzbek_alphabet "Uzbek alphabet") adopted in 2000, the apostrophe serves as a [diacritical mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic "Diacritic") to distinguish different phonemes written with the same letter: it differentiates _\_oʻ\__ (corresponding to Cyrillic _[ў](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short\_U\_(Cyrillic) "Short U (Cyrillic)")_) from _\_o\__, and _\_gʻ\__ (Cyrillic _[ғ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghayn "Ghayn")_) from _\_g\__. This avoids the use of special characters, allowing Uzbek to be typed with ease in ordinary [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII "ASCII") on any Latin keyboard. In addition, a postvocalic apostrophe in Uzbek represents the glottal stop phoneme derived from Arabic _[hamzah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamza "Hamza")_ or _[ʼayn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayin "Ayin")_, replacing Cyrillic _[ъ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yer "Yer")_.
*   In English [Yorkshire dialect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorkshire_dialect "Yorkshire dialect"), the apostrophe is used to represent the word _the_, which is contracted to a more glottal (or 'unreleased') /t/ sound. Most users will write _in t'barn_ ('in the barn'), _on t'step_ ('on the step'); and those unfamiliar with Yorkshire speech will often make these sound like _intuh barn_ and _ontuh step_. A more accurate rendition might be _in't barn_ and _on't step_, though even this does not truly convey correct Yorkshire pronunciation as the _t_ is more like a [glottal stop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glottal_stop "Glottal stop").
*   In the [pinyin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin "Pinyin") (hànyǔ pīnyīn) system of [romanization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization "Romanization") for [Standard Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Chinese "Standard Chinese"), an apostrophe is often loosely said to separate syllables in a word where ambiguity could arise. Example: the standard romanization for the name of the city _[Xī'ān](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X%C4%AB%27%C4%81n "Xī'ān")_ includes an apostrophe to distinguish it from a single-syllable word _\_xian\__. More strictly, however, it is standard to place an apostrophe only before every _a_, _e_, or _o_ that starts a new syllable after the first if it is not preceded by a hyphen or a dash. Examples: _[Tiān'ānmén](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiananmen "Tiananmen")_, _[Yǎ'ān](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y%C7%8E%27%C4%81n "Yǎ'ān")_; but simply _[Jǐnán](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C7%90n%C3%A1n "Jǐnán")_, in which the syllables are _ji_ and _nan_, since the absence of an apostrophe shows that the syllables are not _jin_ and _an_ (contrast _[Jīn'ān](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C4%ABn%27%C4%81n "Jīn'ān")_).[[114]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-124) This is a kind of morpheme-separation marking (see [above](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#To_separate_morphemes)).
*   In the largely superseded [Wade–Giles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wade-Giles "Wade-Giles") romanization for Standard Chinese, an apostrophe marks [aspiration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspiration_(phonetics) "Aspiration (phonetics)") of the preceding consonant sound. Example: in _tsê_ (pinyin _ze_) the consonant represented by _ts_ is unaspirated, but in _ts'ê_ (pinyin _ce_) the consonant represented by _ts'_ is aspirated. Some academic users of the system write this character as a [spiritus asper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiritus_asper "Spiritus asper") (ʽ or ʻ) or single left (opening) [quotation mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark "Quotation mark") (‘).
*   In some systems of romanization for the Japanese, the apostrophe is used between [moras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mora_(linguistics) "Mora (linguistics)") in ambiguous situations, to differentiate between, for example, _\_na\__ and _\_n\__+_\_a\__. (This is similar to the practice in Pinyin mentioned above.)
*   In science fiction and fantasy, the apostrophe is often used in fictional names, sometimes to indicate a [glottal stop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glottal_stop "Glottal stop") (for example [Mitth'raw'nuruodo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitth%27raw%27nuruodo "Mitth'raw'nuruodo") in _[Star Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star\_Wars "Star Wars")_), but also sometimes simply for decoration.

Punctuation (green) and typewriter (red) apostrophe, followed by a [prime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_(symbol) "Prime (symbol)") (blue), between letters Í and í (using [acute accent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_accent "Acute accent")), using the [fonts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Font "Font"): [Arial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arial "Arial"), [Calibri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calibri "Calibri"), [Tahoma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tahoma_(typeface) "Tahoma (typeface)"), [Times New Roman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Times_New_Roman "Times New Roman"), and [Linux Libertine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Libertine "Linux Libertine")

The shape of the apostrophe originated in [manuscript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuscript "Manuscript") writing, as a point with a downwards tail curving clockwise. This is the form of the modern **punctuation apostrophe** (’),[[115]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-125) (which is also known informally as the **[typeset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typeset "Typeset") apostrophe**, the **typographic apostrophe** or the **curly apostrophe**) and of the [right single quotation mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_single_quotation_mark "Right single quotation mark"). Later [sans-serif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sans-serif "Sans-serif") typefaces had stylised apostrophes with a more geometric or simplified form, but usually retaining the same directional bias as a closing quotation mark.

With the invention of the [typewriter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typewriter "Typewriter"), a "neutral" or "straight" shape quotation mark, ' (known as the "typewriter apostrophe" or the "ASCII apostrophe"), was created to represent a number of different glyphs with a single keystroke: the apostrophe, both the opening and the closing single [quotation marks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark "Quotation mark"), the single [primes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_(symbol) "Prime (symbol)"), and on some typewriters even the [exclamation point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_point "Exclamation point") (by backspacing and overprinting with a period). This is known as the **typewriter apostrophe** or **vertical apostrophe**. The same convention was adopted for double [quotation marks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark "Quotation mark") ("). Both simplifications carried over to computer keyboards and the [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII "ASCII") character set.

Informal use in measurement and mathematics
-------------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Apostrophe&action=edit&section=43 "Edit section: Informal use in measurement and mathematics")]

Formally, the symbol used to represent a [foot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot_(unit) "Foot (unit)") of length, depth, or height, is ′ (prime) and that for the [inch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inch "Inch") is ″ (double prime).[[116]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-CMOS-126) (Thus, for example, the notation 5′ 7″ signifies 5 feet and 7 inches). Similarly, the prime symbol is the formal representation of a [minute of arc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute_of_arc "Minute of arc") (1/60 of a [degree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle) "Degree (angle)") in [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry") and [geomatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomatics "Geomatics")), and double prime represents a [second of arc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_of_arc "Second of arc") (for example, 17°54′32″ represents 17 degrees 54 minutes and 32 seconds). Similarly in mathematics, the prime is generally used to generate more variable names for similar things without resorting to subscripts, with x′ generally meaning something related to (or derived from) x.

Because of the very close similarity of the typewriter apostrophe and typewriter double quote to prime and double prime, substitution in informal contexts is ubiquitous but they are deprecated in contexts where proper typography is important. There is also a risk of an automatic process "correcting" a typewriter apostrophe to a punctuation apostrophe, which results in another variant when a prime symbol was intended.

In its [Unicode Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_Standard "Unicode Standard") (version 13.0), the [Unicode Consortium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_Consortium "Unicode Consortium") describes three characters that represent apostrophe:

*   U+0027'APOSTROPHE: The typewriter or ASCII apostrophe. The standard remarks:

> For historical reasons, U+0027 is a particularly overloaded character. In ASCII, it is used to represent a punctuation mark (such as right single quotation mark, left single quotation mark, apostrophe punctuation, vertical line, or prime) or a modifier letter (such as apostrophe modifier or acute accent). Punctuation marks generally break words; modifier letters generally are considered part of a word.[[117]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-ch06.pdf-127)

*   U+2019’[RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_single_quotation_mark "Right single quotation mark") is preferred where the character is to represent a punctuation mark, as for contractions: "we’ve", and the code is also referred to as a **punctuation apostrophe**.[[117]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-ch06.pdf-127) The closing single quote and the apostrophe were unified in Unicode 2.1 "to correct problems in the mapping tables from [Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP1252 "CP1252") and [Macintosh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_Roman "Mac Roman") code pages."[[118]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-128) This can make searching text more difficult as quotes and apostrophes cannot be distinguished without context.
*   U+02BC ʼ MODIFIER LETTER APOSTROPHE (from Unicode block [Spacing Modifier Letters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacing_Modifier_Letters "Spacing Modifier Letters")) is preferred where the apostrophe is to represent a modifier letter (for example, in transliterations to indicate a glottal stop). In the latter case, it is also referred to as a [letter apostrophe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modifier_letter_apostrophe "Modifier letter apostrophe").[[119]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-Unicode9.0-Chapter6-129) The letter apostrophe may be used, for example, in transliterations to represent the Arabic [glottal stop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glottal_stop "Glottal stop") (_[hamza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamza "Hamza")_)[[119]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-Unicode9.0-Chapter6-129) or the Cyrillic "[soft sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_sign "Soft sign")", or in some orthographies such as _\_cʼh\__ of [Breton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breton_language "Breton language"),[[120]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-cldr-br-alphabet-130) where this combination is an independent [trigraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigraph_(orthography) "Trigraph (orthography)"). [ICANN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICANN "ICANN") considers this the proper character for [Ukrainian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_alphabet "Ukrainian alphabet") apostrophe within [IDNs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalized_domain_name "Internationalized domain name").[[121]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-131) This character is rendered identically to U+2019 in the Unicode code charts, and the standard cautions that one should never assume this code is used in any language.[[119]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-Unicode9.0-Chapter6-129)

In modern computing practice, Unicode is the standard and default method for character encoding. However, Unicode itself and many [legacy applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legacy_applications "Legacy applications") have echoes of earlier practices. Furthermore, the limited [character set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_set "Character set") provided by [computer keyboards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_keyboard "Computer keyboard") has also required practical and pragmatic adjustments. These issues are detailed below.

The typewriter apostrophe, ', was inherited by computer keyboards, and is the only apostrophe [character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(computing) "Character (computing)") available in the (7-bit) [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII "ASCII")[character encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_encoding "Character encoding"), at code value [0x](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal "Hexadecimal")27 (39). In ASCII, it may be used to represent any of left single [quotation mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark "Quotation mark"), right single quotation mark, apostrophe, vertical line or [prime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_(symbol) "Prime (symbol)") (punctuation marks), or an [acute accent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_accent "Acute accent") (modifier letters). In Unicode, which is a superset of ASCII, it is encoded as U+0027'APOSTROPHE.

Many earlier (pre-1985) computer displays and printers rendered the ASCII apostrophe as a punctuation apostrophe, and rendered the [backtick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtick "Backtick") (freestanding [grave accent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grave_accent "Grave accent") symbol, `, 0x60, 96) as a matching left single quotation mark. This allowed a more "typeset" appearance of text: ```I can't''` would appear as ``I can´t´´ on these systems. This can still be seen in many documents prepared at that time, and is still used in the [TeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX "TeX") typesetting system to create typographic quotes.

### Punctuation apostrophe in 8-bit encodings

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Apostrophe&action=edit&section=48 "Edit section: Punctuation apostrophe in 8-bit encodings")]

Support for the punctuation apostrophe (’) was introduced in several 8-bit character encodings, such as the original [Apple Macintosh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_Mac_OS "Classic Mac OS") operating system's [Mac Roman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_Roman "Mac Roman") character set (in 1984), and later in the [CP1252](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP1252 "CP1252") encoding of [Microsoft Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows "Microsoft Windows"). Both sets also used this code point for a closing single quote. There is no such character in [ISO 8859-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8859-1 "ISO 8859-1").

The [Microsoft Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows "Microsoft Windows")[code page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_code_page "Windows code page")[CP1252](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP1252 "CP1252") (sometimes incorrectly called _ANSI_ or _ISO-Latin_) contains the punctuation apostrophe at 0x92. Due to "smart quotes" in Microsoft software converting the ASCII apostrophe to this value, other software makers have been effectively forced to adopt this as a _de facto_ convention. For instance, the [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5 "HTML5") standard specifies that this value is interpreted as this character from CP1252.[[123]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-133) Some earlier non-Microsoft browsers would display a '?' for this and make web pages composed with Microsoft software somewhat hard to read.

In Unicode (which practically all vendors have adopted), this apostrophe is encoded as U+2019’RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK. (The canonical name reflects the primary usage; its further use as the preferred form for an apostrophe is recorded in the database.[[124]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-134))

### Entering apostrophes

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Apostrophe&action=edit&section=49 "Edit section: Entering apostrophes")]

Although ubiquitous in typeset material, the punctuation apostrophe (’) is rather difficult to enter on a computer, since it does not have its own key on most types of [consumer keyboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_keyboard "Computer keyboard"). Outside the world of professional typesetting and graphic design, most people use the typewriter apostrophe ('). Because typewriter apostrophes are now often [automatically converted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocorrection "Autocorrection") to punctuation apostrophes by [word processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_processor "Word processor") and similar software, the punctuation apostrophe routinely appears in documents produced by non-professionals (albeit sometimes incorrectly—see [§Smart Quotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#Smart_Quotes) below).

[XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML "XML") (and hence [XHTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XHTML "XHTML")) defines an `&apos;`[character entity reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_entity_reference "Character entity reference") for the ASCII typewriter apostrophe. This entity reference is officially supported in HTML since [HTML 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_5 "HTML 5").[[note 11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-136)

To make punctuation apostrophes easier to enter, [word processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_processing "Word processing") and publishing software often convert typewriter apostrophes to punctuation apostrophes during text entry (at the same time converting opening and closing single and double quotes to their standard left-handed or right-handed forms). A similar facility may be offered on web servers after submitting text in a form field, e.g. on weblogs or free encyclopedias. This is known as the _smart quotes_ feature; apostrophes and quotation marks that are not automatically altered by computer programs are known as _dumb quotes_.

Such conversion is not always correct. Smart quotes features often incorrectly convert a leading apostrophe to an opening quotation mark (e.g., in abbreviations of years: _‘29_ rather than the correct _’29_ for the years _1929_ or _2029_ (depending on context); or _‘twas_ instead of _’twas_ as the [archaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaism "Archaism") abbreviation of _it was_). Smart quote features also often fail to recognise situations when a [prime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_(symbol) "Prime (symbol)") rather than an apostrophe is needed; for example, incorrectly rendering the latitude 49°53′08″ as 49°53’08”.

In [Microsoft Word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word "Microsoft Word") it is possible to turn smart quotes off (in some versions, by navigating through _Tools_, _AutoCorrect_, _AutoFormat as you type_, and then unchecking the appropriate option). Alternatively, typing Control-Z (for _Undo_) immediately after entering the apostrophe will convert it back to a typewriter apostrophe. In Microsoft Word for Windows, holding down the Control key while typing two apostrophes will produce a single punctuation apostrophe.

Some programming languages, like [Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language) "Pascal (programming language)"), use the ASCII apostrophe to delimit [string literals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_literal "String literal"). In many languages, including [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript "JavaScript"), [ECMAScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript "ECMAScript"), and [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language) "Python (programming language)"), either the apostrophe or the double quote may be used, allowing string literals to contain the other character (but not to contain both without using an [escape character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_character "Escape character")), e.g. `foo='He said "Bar!"';`. Strings delimited with apostrophes are often called _single quoted_. Some languages, such as [Perl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl "Perl"), [PHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP "PHP"), and many shell languages, treat single quoted strings as "raw" strings, while double quoted strings have expressions (such as `"$variable"`) replaced with their values when interpreted.

The [C programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language) "C (programming language)") (and many [derived languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_C-family_programming_languages "List of C-family programming languages") like [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B "C++"), [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language) "Java (programming language)"), [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language) "C Sharp (programming language)"), and [Scala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scala_(programming_language) "Scala (programming language)")) uses apostrophes to delimit a [character literal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_literal "Character literal"). In these languages a character is a different object than a one-letter string.

In [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B "C++"), since [C++14](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B14 "C++14"), apostrophes can be included as optional digit separators in numeric literals.

In [Visual Basic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic "Visual Basic") (and earlier Microsoft BASIC dialects such as QuickBASIC) an apostrophe is used to denote the start of a comment.[[note 12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-137)

In the [Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language) "Lisp (programming language)") family of programming languages, an apostrophe is shorthand for the `quote` operator.

Notes and references

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Apostrophe&action=edit&section=53 "Edit section: Notes and references")]

1.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_ref-13 "Jump up")**"Pease" as an old plural of "pea" is indeterminate: Lentils' and pease'[s] use in such dishes was optional. Nouns borrowed from French ending in _-eau_, _-eu_, _-au_, or _-ou_ sometimes have alternative plurals that retain the French _-x_: _beaux_ or _beaus_; _bureaux_ or _bureaus_; _adieux_ or _adieus_; _fabliaux_ or _fabliaus_; _choux_ or _chous_. The _x_ in these plurals is often pronounced. If it is, then (in the absence of specific rulings from style guides) the plural possessives are formed with an apostrophe alone: _the beaux' [or beaus'] appearance at the ball_; _the bureaux' [or bureaus'] responses differed_. If the _x_ is not pronounced, then in the absence of special rulings the plurals are formed with an apostrophe followed by an _s_: _the beaux's appearance_; _the bureaux's responses_; _their adieux's effect was that everyone wept_. See also [Nouns ending with silent "s", "x" or "z"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#Nouns_ending_with_silent_s,_x,_or_z), below, and attached notes.
2.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_ref-21 "Jump up")**For instance: 
    *   _[The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Cambridge\_Grammar\_of\_the\_English\_Language "The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language")_, explicitly states

"Types I [Jack and Jill's] and II [Jack's and Jill's] are not semantically contrastive. Both allow either a joint or distributive interpretation of the genitive relation."[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-Cambridge_Grammar:_Coordination_and_genitives-19)
    *   _[A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A\_Comprehensive\_Grammar\_of\_the\_English\_Language "A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language")_ explicitly states

"A coordination of genitives such as _John's and Mary's children_ may be interpreted in either a combinatory or a segregatory fashion: combinatory meaning: 'the children who are joint offspring of John and Mary'segregatory meaning: 'John's child and Mary's child'or 'John's children and Mary's child'or 'John's child and Mary's children'or 'John's children and Mary's children' "[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-Comprehensive_Grammar:_Coordination_of_genitives-20)
3.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_ref-25 "Jump up")**For instance: 
    *   _[The Chicago Manual of Style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Chicago\_Manual\_of\_Style "The Chicago Manual of Style")_ (16th ed.) states:

"Closely linked nouns are considered a single unit in forming the possessive when the thing being 'possessed' is the same for both; only the second element takes the possessive form. my aunt and uncle's house [...]When the things possessed are discrete, both nouns take the possessive form. my aunt's and uncle's medical profiles [...]"[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-CMS:_Joint_versus_separate_possession-22)
    *   _[New Hart's Rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New\_Hart%27s\_Rules "New Hart's Rules")_ states:

"Use _'s_ after the last of a set of linked nouns where the nouns are acting together [...] but repeat _'s_ after each noun in a set where the nouns are acting separately"[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-New_Hart's_Rules:_Possession-23)
    *   _[Garner's Modern American Usage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garner%27s\_Modern\_American\_Usage "Garner's Modern American Usage")_ states

"For joint possession, an apostrophe goes with the last element in a series of names. If you put an apostrophe with each element in the series, you signal individual possession."[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-Garner's:_Joint_possessives-24)
4.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_ref-29 "Jump up")**This is standard even though the possessive word _hers_ is usually spelled without an apostrophe; see below in this section.
5.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_ref-30 "Jump up")**Most sources are against continuing the [italics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italics "Italics") used in such titles to the apostrophe and the _s_.
6.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_ref-32 "Jump up")**See for example _[New Hart's Rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New\_Hart%27s\_Rules "New Hart's Rules")_. Not one of the other sources listed on this page supports the use of _it's_ as a possessive form of _it_.
7.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_ref-48 "Jump up")**An apparent exception is _The Complete Stylist_, Sheridan Baker, 2nd edition 1972, p.165: "_... citizens' rights_, _the Joneses' possessions_, and similarly _The Beaux' Stratagem_." But in fact the _x_ in _beaux_, as in other such plurals in English, is often already pronounced (see a note to [Basic rule (plural nouns)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#Basic_rule_(plural_nouns)), above); _[The Beaux Stratagem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Beaux\_Stratagem "The Beaux Stratagem")_, the title of a play by George Farquhar (1707), originally lacked the apostrophe (see [the title page](https://archive.org/details/beauxstratagema01farqgoog) of a 1752 edition); and it is complicated by the following _s_ in _stratagem_. Some modern editions add the apostrophe (some with an _s_ also), some omit it; and some make a compound with a hyphen: _The Beaux-Stratagem_. Farquhar himself used the apostrophe elsewhere in the standard ways, for both omission and possession.
8.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_ref-63 "Jump up")**_Gregg Reference Manual_, 10th edition, 2003, distinguishes between what it calls _possessive_ and _descriptive_ forms, and uses this distinction in analyzing the problem. From paragraph 628: "a.Do not mistake a descriptive form ending in _s_ for a possessive form[:] sales effort (sales describes the kind of effort)... b.Some cases can be difficult to distinguish. Is it _the girls basketball team_ or _the girls' basketball team?_ Try substituting an irregular plural like _women_. You would not say _the women basketball team_; you would say _the women's basketball team_. By analogy, _the girls' basketball team_ is correct" [italics given exactly as in original, including following punctuation]. (However in this case the phrase in question is not part of the name: the words are not capitalised!) And then this principle is applied to organizations at paragraph 640, where examples are given, including the non-conforming _Childrens Hospital, (in Los Angeles)_: "The names of many organizations, products, and publications contain words that could be considered either possessive or descriptive terms... c. In all cases follow the organization's preference when known."
9.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_ref-113 "Jump up")**In early French such elisions did occur: _\_m'espée\__ (_\_ma\__+_\_espée\__, modern French _\_mon épée\__: 'my sword'), _\_s'enfance\__ (_\_sa\__+_\_enfance\__, _\_son enfance\__: 'his or her childhood'). But the only modern survivals of this elision with apostrophe are _\_m'amie\__ and _\_m'amour\__, as archaic and idiomatic alternatives to _\_mon amie\__ and _\_mon amour\__ ('my [female] friend', 'my love'); forms without the apostrophe also used: _\_mamie\__ or _\_ma mie\__, _\_mamour\__.
10.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_ref-117 "Jump up")**Examples include _\_Nuestras vidas son los ríos/que van a dar en la mar,/qu'es el morir.\__ meaning 'Our lives are the rivers/that flow to give to the sea,/which is death.' (from _Coplas de Don Jorge Manrique por la muerte de su padre_, 1477) and _\_¿...qué me ha de aprovechar ver la pintura/d'aquel que con las alas derretidas...?\__ meaning '...what could it help me to see the painting of that one with the melted wings...?' (from the 12th sonnet of Garcilazo de la Vega, c. 1500–36).
11.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_ref-136 "Jump up")**It is _not_ defined in [HTML 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_4 "HTML 4")[[125]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_note-135) despite all the other predefined character entities from XML being defined.
12.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#cite_ref-137 "Jump up")**As a comment character in MS BASIC, the apostrophe is in most cases an abbreviation of the REM statement, which can be appended to the end of almost any line with a colon (:). The cases where the apostrophe is not an abbreviation for `REM` would be those where the apostrophe is allowed but a REM statement is not. Note that there are also cases of the reverse constraint; for example, in QuickBASIC, a comment at the end of a DATA statement line cannot start with an apostrophe but must use `: REM`.
