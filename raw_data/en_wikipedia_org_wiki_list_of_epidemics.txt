Widespread non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease and cancer are not included. An epidemic is the rapid spread of disease to a large number of people in a given population within a short period of time; in meningococcal infections , an attack rate in excess of 15 cases per 100,000 people for two consecutive weeks is considered an epidemic.

[ 1 ] Due to the long time spans, the first plague pandemic (6th century – 8th century) and the second plague pandemic (14th century – early 19th century) are shown by individual outbreaks, such as the Plague of Justinian (first pandemic) and the Black Death (second pandemic).

Infectious diseases with high prevalence are listed separately (sometimes in addition to their epidemics), such as malaria , which may have killed 50–60 billion people.

[ 2 ] Major epidemics and pandemics [ edit ] By death toll [ edit ] Ongoing epidemics and pandemics are in boldface . For a given epidemic or pandemic, the average of its estimated death toll range is used for ranking. If the death toll averages of two or more epidemics or pandemics are equal, then the smaller the range, the higher the rank. For the historical records of major changes in the world population, see world population .

Western Hemisphere populations were ravaged mostly by smallpox , but also typhus , measles , influenza , bubonic plague , cholera , malaria , tuberculosis , mumps , yellow fever , and pertussis . The lack of written records in many places and the destruction of many native societies by disease, war, and colonization make estimates uncertain. Deaths probably numbered in the tens or perhaps over a hundred million, with perhaps 90% of the population dead in the worst-hit areas. Lack of scientific knowledge about microorganisms and lack of surviving medical records for many areas makes attribution of specific numbers to specific diseases uncertain.

Infectious diseases with high prevalence [ edit ] Further information: List of causes of death by rate There have been various major infectious diseases with high prevalence worldwide, but they are currently not listed in the above table as epidemics/pandemics due to the lack of definite data, such as time span and death toll.

An Ethiopian child with malaria, a disease with an annual death rate of 619,000 as of 2021.

[ 18 ] Malaria has had multiple documented temporary epidemics in otherwise non-affected or low-prevalence areas. Malaria is commonly spread by mosquitoes. The vast majority of its deaths are due to its constant prevalence in affected areas.

[ 2 ] Tuberculosis (TB) became epidemic in Europe in the 18th and 19th century, showing a seasonal pattern, and is still taking place globally. TB causes symptoms including consumption (coughing up blood due to TB). TB is serious and if caught, needs strong antibiotics immediately.

[ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] The morbidity and mortality of TB and HIV/AIDS have been closely linked, known as "TB/HIV syndemic".

[ 21 ] [ 22 ] According to the World Health Organization , approximately 10 million new TB infections occur every year, and 1.5 million people die from it each year – making it the world's top infectious killer (before COVID-19 pandemic ).

[ 21 ] However, there is a lack of sources which describe major TB epidemics with definite time spans and death tolls.

Hepatitis B : According to the World Health Organization, as of 2019 [update] there are about 296 million people living with chronic hepatitis B, with 1.5 million new infections each year. In 2019, hepatitis B caused about 820,000 deaths, mostly from cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (primary liver cancer ).

[ 23 ] In many places of Asia and Africa, hepatitis B has become endemic .

[ 24 ] In addition, a person is sometimes infected with both hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HIV, and this population (about 2.7 million) accounts for about 1% of the total HBV infections.

[ 23 ] Hepatitis C : According to the World Health Organization, there are approximately 58 million people with chronic hepatitis C, with about 1.5 million new infections occurring per year. In 2019, approximately 290,000 people died from the disease, mostly from cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (primary liver cancer ).

[ 25 ] There have been many hepatitis C virus (HCV) epidemics in history.

[ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] Chronology [ edit ] Events in boldface are ongoing.
