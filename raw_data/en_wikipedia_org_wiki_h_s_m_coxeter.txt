F. Baker [ 1 ] Doctoral students W. G. Brown Norman Johnson Harold Scott MacDonald " Donald " Coxeter CC FRS FRSC (9 February 1907 – 31 March 2003) [ 2 ] was a British-Canadian geometer and mathematician. He is regarded as one of the greatest geometers of the 20th century.

[ 3 ] Coxeter was born in England and educated at the University of Cambridge , with student visits to Princeton University . He worked for 60 years at the University of Toronto in Canada, from 1936 until his retirement in 1996, becoming a full professor there in 1948. His many honours included membership in the Royal Society of Canada , the Royal Society , and the Order of Canada .

He was an author of 12 books, including The Fifty-Nine Icosahedra (1938) and Regular Polytopes (1947). Many concepts in geometry and group theory are named after him, including the Coxeter graph , Coxeter groups , Coxeter's loxodromic sequence of tangent circles , Coxeter–Dynkin diagrams , and the Todd–Coxeter algorithm .

Biography [ edit ] Coxeter was born in Kensington , England, to Harold Samuel Coxeter and Lucy ( née Gee ). His father had taken over the family business of Coxeter & Son, manufacturers of surgical instruments and compressed gases (including a mechanism for anaesthetising surgical patients with nitrous oxide ), but was able to retire early and focus on sculpting and baritone singing; Lucy Coxeter was a portrait and landscape painter who had attended the Royal Academy of Arts . A maternal cousin was the architect Sir Giles Gilbert Scott .

[ 4 ] [ 2 ] In his youth, Coxeter composed music and was an accomplished pianist at the age of 10.

[ 5 ] He felt that mathematics and music were intimately related, outlining his ideas in a 1962 article on "Music and Mathematics" in the Canadian Music Journal .

[ 5 ] He was educated at King Alfred School, London , and St George's School, Harpenden , where his best friend was John Flinders Petrie, later a mathematician for whom Petrie polygons were named. He was accepted at King's College, Cambridge , in 1925, but decided to spend a year studying in hopes of gaining admittance to Trinity College , where the standard of mathematics was higher.

[ 2 ] Coxeter won an entrance scholarship and went to Trinity in 1926 to read mathematics. There he earned his BA (as Senior Wrangler ) in 1928, and his doctorate in 1931.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] In 1932 he went to Princeton University for a year as a Rockefeller Fellow , where he worked with Hermann Weyl , Oswald Veblen , and Solomon Lefschetz .

[ 6 ] Returning to Trinity for a year, he attended Ludwig Wittgenstein 's seminars on the philosophy of mathematics .

[ 5 ] Wittgenstein selected Coxeter and others to take notes of his lectures, the collection of which later became The Blue Book .

[ 7 ] In 1934 he spent a further year at Princeton as a Procter Fellow.

[ 6 ] In 1936 Coxeter moved to the University of Toronto. In 1938 he and P. Du Val , H. T. Flather, and John Flinders Petrie published The Fifty-Nine Icosahedra with University of Toronto Press . In 1940 Coxeter edited the eleventh edition of Mathematical Recreations and Essays , [ 8 ] originally published by W. W. Rouse Ball in 1892. He was elevated to professor in 1948. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada in 1948 and a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1950. He met M. C. Escher in 1954 and the two became lifelong friends; his work on geometric figures helped inspire some of Escher's works, particularly the Circle Limit series based on hyperbolic tessellations . He also inspired some of the innovations of Buckminster Fuller .

[ 6 ] Coxeter, M. S. Longuet-Higgins and J. C. P. Miller were the first to publish the full list of uniform polyhedra (1954).

[ 9 ] He worked for 60 years at the University of Toronto and published twelve books.

Personal life [ edit ] Coxeter was a vegetarian . He attributed his longevity to his vegetarian diet, daily exercise such as fifty press-ups and standing on his head for fifteen minutes each morning, and consuming a nightly cocktail made from Kahlúa (a coffee liqueur), peach schnapps , and soy milk .

[ 4 ] Awards [ edit ] Since 1978, the Canadian Mathematical Society have awarded the Coxeter–James Prize in his honor.

He was made a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1950 and in 1997 he was awarded their Sylvester Medal .

[ 6 ] In 1990, he became a Foreign Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences [ 10 ] and in 1997 was made a Companion of the Order of Canada .

[ 11 ] In 1973 he received the Jeffery–Williams Prize .

[ 6 ] A festschrift in his honour, The Geometric Vein , was published in 1982. It contained 41 essays on geometry, based on a symposium for Coxeter held at Toronto in 1979.

[ 12 ] A second such volume, The Coxeter Legacy , was published in 2006 based on a Toronto Coxeter symposium held in 2004.
