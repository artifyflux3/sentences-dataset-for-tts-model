[Stephen Robinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Robinson "Stephen Robinson") riding the [Canadarm2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadarm2 "Canadarm2") while conducting the first in-flight repair of the Space Shuttle during [STS-114](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-114 "STS-114") on August 3, 2005. The landmass in the backdrop is the [Bari region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bari,_Somalia "Bari, Somalia") of [Somalia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somalia "Somalia").

**Extravehicular activity** (**EVA**) is any activity done by an [astronaut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut "Astronaut") in [outer space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_space "Outer space") outside a [spacecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft "Spacecraft"). In the absence of a breathable [Earthlike atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth "Atmosphere of Earth"), the astronaut is completely reliant on a [space suit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit "Space suit") for environmental support. EVA includes **spacewalks** and [lunar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon "Moon") or [planetary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet "Planet") surface exploration (commonly known from 1969 to 1972 as **moonwalks**). In a stand-up EVA (SEVA), an astronaut stands through an open hatch but does not fully leave the spacecraft.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_activity#cite_note-standup-1) EVAs have been conducted by the [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union")/Russia, the United States, and China; astronauts from Canada, Japan, Brazil, the United Arab Emirates, and the [European Space Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Space_Agency "European Space Agency") have also participated in EVAs conducted by those nations.

On March 18, 1965, [Alexei Leonov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexei_Leonov "Alexei Leonov") became the first human to perform a spacewalk, exiting the [Voskhod 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voskhod_2 "Voskhod 2") capsule for 12 minutes and 9 seconds. On July 20, 1969, [Neil Armstrong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Armstrong "Neil Armstrong") became the first human to perform a moonwalk, outside his lunar lander on [Apollo 11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11 "Apollo 11") for 2 hours and 31 minutes. In 1984, [Svetlana Savitskaya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svetlana_Savitskaya "Svetlana Savitskaya") became the first woman to perform a spacewalk, conducting EVA outside the [Salyut 7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salyut_7 "Salyut 7") space station for 3 hours and 35 minutes. On the last three Moon missions, astronauts also performed deep-space EVAs on the return to Earth, to retrieve film canisters from the outside of the spacecraft. American Astronauts [Pete Conrad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Conrad "Pete Conrad"), [Joseph Kerwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_P._Kerwin "Joseph P. Kerwin"), and [Paul Weitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_J._Weitz "Paul J. Weitz") also used EVA in 1973 to repair launch damage to [Skylab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skylab "Skylab"), the United States' first space station.

EVAs may be either tethered (the [astronaut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut "Astronaut") is connected to the spacecraft; oxygen and electrical power can be supplied through an [umbilical cable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cable "Umbilical cable"); no propulsion is needed to return to the spacecraft), or untethered. Untethered spacewalks were only performed on three missions in 1984 using the [Manned Maneuvering Unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manned_Maneuvering_Unit "Manned Maneuvering Unit") (MMU), and on a flight test in 1994 of the [Simplified Aid For EVA Rescue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_Aid_For_EVA_Rescue "Simplified Aid For EVA Rescue") (SAFER), a safety device worn on tethered U.S. EVAs.

Development history
-------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Extravehicular_activity&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Development history")]

[NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA "NASA") planners invented the term _extravehicular activity_ (abbreviated with the acronym EVA) in the early 1960s for the [Apollo program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_program "Apollo program") to land humans on the Moon, because the astronauts would leave the spacecraft to collect [lunar material samples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_rock "Moon rock") and deploy scientific experiments. To support this, and other Apollo objectives, the [Gemini program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Gemini "Project Gemini") was spun off to develop the capability for astronauts to work outside a two-person Earth orbiting spacecraft. However, the [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union") was fiercely competitive in holding the early lead it had gained in crewed spaceflight, so the [Soviet Communist Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union "Communist Party of the Soviet Union"), led by [Nikita Khrushchev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikita_Khrushchev "Nikita Khrushchev"), ordered the conversion of its single-pilot [Vostok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vostok_(spacecraft) "Vostok (spacecraft)") capsule into a two- or three-person craft named [Voskhod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voskhod_spacecraft "Voskhod spacecraft"), in order to compete with [Gemini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_program "Gemini program") and [Apollo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_(spacecraft) "Apollo (spacecraft)").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_activity#cite_note-Siddiqi_384-6-2) The Soviets were able to launch two Voskhod capsules before U.S. was able to launch its first crewed Gemini.

The Voskhod's [avionics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avionics "Avionics") required cooling by cabin air to prevent any kind of overheating, therefore an [airlock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airlock "Airlock") was required for the spacewalking [cosmonaut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmonaut "Cosmonaut") to exit and re-enter the cabin while it remained pressurized. Unusually, and by contrast, the Gemini avionics did not require air cooling, allowing the spacewalking astronaut to exit and re-enter the depressurized cabin through an open hatch. Because of this, the [American](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States") and [Soviet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union") space programs developed different definitions for the duration of an EVA. The Soviet (now [Russian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia "Russia")) definition begins when the outer airlock hatch is open and the cosmonaut is in [vacuum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum "Vacuum"). An American EVA began when the astronaut had at least their head outside the spacecraft.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_activity#cite_note-3) The U.S. has changed its EVA definition since.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_activity#cite_note-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_activity#cite_note-5)

[![Image 3](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/47/FirstSpaceWalk.png/250px-FirstSpaceWalk.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:FirstSpaceWalk.png)

[Alexei Leonov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexei_Leonov "Alexei Leonov") performs the first spacewalk during [Voskhod 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voskhod_2 "Voskhod 2").

The first EVA was performed on March 18, 1965, by Soviet cosmonaut [Alexei Leonov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexei_Leonov "Alexei Leonov"), who spent 12 minutes and 9 seconds outside the [Voskhod 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voskhod_2 "Voskhod 2") spacecraft. Carrying a white metal backpack containing 45 minutes' worth of breathing and pressurization oxygen, Leonov had no means to control his motion other than pulling on his 15.35 m (50.4 ft) tether. After the flight, he claimed this was easy, but his [space suit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit "Space suit") ballooned from its internal pressure against the vacuum of space, stiffening so much that he could not activate the shutter on his chest-mounted camera.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_activity#cite_note-portree-6)

At the end of his space walk, the suit stiffening caused a more serious problem: Leonov had to re-enter the capsule through the inflatable cloth airlock, 1.2 m (3 ft 11 in) in diameter and 2.5 m (8 ft 2 in) long. He improperly entered the airlock head-first and got stuck sideways. He could not get back in without reducing the pressure in his suit, risking "[the bends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decompression_sickness "Decompression sickness")". This added another 12 minutes to his time in vacuum, and he was overheated by 1.8°C (3.2°F) from the exertion. It would be almost four years before the Soviets tried another EVA. They misrepresented to the press how difficult Leonov found it to work in [weightlessness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weightlessness "Weightlessness") and concealed the problems encountered until after the end of the [Cold War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War "Cold War").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_activity#cite_note-portree-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_activity#cite_note-First-Spacewalk-7)

[![Image 4](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/EdWhiteFirstAmericanSpacewalker.1965.ws.jpg/250px-EdWhiteFirstAmericanSpacewalker.1965.ws.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:EdWhiteFirstAmericanSpacewalker.1965.ws.jpg)

[Ed White](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_White_(astronaut) "Ed White (astronaut)") performs the first American spacewalk during [Gemini IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_IV "Gemini IV").

The first American spacewalk was performed on June 3, 1965, by [Ed White](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_White_(astronaut) "Ed White (astronaut)") from the second crewed [Gemini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Gemini "Project Gemini") flight, [Gemini IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_IV "Gemini IV"), for 21 minutes. White was tethered to the spacecraft, and his oxygen was supplied through a 25-foot (7.6 m) [umbilical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cable "Umbilical cable"), which also carried communications and biomedical instrumentation. He was the first to control his motion in space with a [Hand-Held Maneuvering Unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand-Held_Maneuvering_Unit "Hand-Held Maneuvering Unit"), which worked well but only carried enough propellant for 20 seconds. White found his tether useful for limiting his distance from the spacecraft but difficult to use for moving around, contrary to Leonov's claim.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_activity#cite_note-portree-6) However, a defect in the capsule's hatch latching mechanism caused difficulties opening and closing the hatch, which delayed the start of the EVA and put White and his crewmate at risk of not getting back to Earth alive.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_activity#cite_note-mcdivittoh-8)

No EVAs were planned on the next three Gemini flights. The next EVA was planned to be made by [David Scott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Scott "David Scott") on [Gemini VIII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_VIII "Gemini VIII"), but that mission had to be aborted due to a critical spacecraft malfunction before the EVA could be conducted. Astronauts on the next three Gemini flights ([Eugene Cernan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Cernan "Eugene Cernan"), [Michael Collins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Collins_(astronaut) "Michael Collins (astronaut)"), and [Richard Gordon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_F._Gordon_Jr. "Richard F. Gordon Jr.")), performed several EVAs, but none was able to successfully work for long periods outside the spacecraft without tiring and overheating. Cernan attempted but failed to test an Air Force [Astronaut Maneuvering Unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut_Maneuvering_Unit "Astronaut Maneuvering Unit") which included a self-contained oxygen system.

On November 13, 1966, [Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_%22Buzz%22_Aldrin "Edwin \"Buzz\" Aldrin") became the first to successfully work in space without tiring during [Gemini XII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_XII "Gemini XII"), the last Gemini mission. Aldrin worked outside the spacecraft for 2 hours and 6 minutes, in addition to two stand-up EVAs in the spacecraft hatch for an additional 3 hours and 24 minutes. Aldrin's interest in [scuba diving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuba_diving "Scuba diving") inspired the use of [underwater EVA training](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutral_buoyancy_simulation_as_a_training_aid "Neutral buoyancy simulation as a training aid") to simulate weightlessness, which has been used ever since to allow astronauts to practice techniques of avoiding wasted muscle energy.

### First crew transfer

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Extravehicular_activity&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: First crew transfer")]

On January 16, 1969, Soviet cosmonauts [Aleksei Yeliseyev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksei_Yeliseyev "Aleksei Yeliseyev") and [Yevgeny Khrunov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yevgeny_Khrunov "Yevgeny Khrunov") transferred from [Soyuz 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_5 "Soyuz 5") to [Soyuz 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_4 "Soyuz 4"), which were docked together. This was the second Soviet EVA, and it would be almost another nine years before the Soviets performed their third.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_activity#cite_note-portree-6)

[![Image 5](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/A_Man_on_the_Moon%2C_AS11-40-5903_%28cropped%29.jpg/250px-A_Man_on_the_Moon%2C_AS11-40-5903_%28cropped%29.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:A_Man_on_the_Moon,_AS11-40-5903_(cropped).jpg)

[Buzz Aldrin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin "Buzz Aldrin") walks on the Moon during the pioneering [Apollo 11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11 "Apollo 11") mission in 1969.

American astronauts [Neil Armstrong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Armstrong "Neil Armstrong") and [Buzz Aldrin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin "Buzz Aldrin") performed the first EVA on the lunar surface on July 21, 1969 ([UTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTC "UTC")), after landing their [Apollo 11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11 "Apollo 11")[Lunar Module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Lunar_Module "Apollo Lunar Module") spacecraft. This first Moon walk, using self-contained [portable life support systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_life_support_system "Portable life support system"), lasted 2 hours and 36 minutes. A total of fifteen Moon walks were performed among six Apollo crews, including [Charles "Pete" Conrad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Conrad "Pete Conrad"), [Alan Bean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Bean "Alan Bean"), [Alan Shepard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Shepard "Alan Shepard"), [Edgar Mitchell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Mitchell "Edgar Mitchell"), [David Scott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Scott "David Scott"), [James Irwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Irwin "James Irwin"), [John Young](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Young_(astronaut) "John Young (astronaut)"), [Charles Duke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Duke "Charles Duke"), [Eugene Cernan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Cernan "Eugene Cernan"), and [Harrison "Jack" Schmitt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrison_Schmitt "Harrison Schmitt"). Cernan was the last Apollo astronaut to step off the surface of the Moon.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_activity#cite_note-portree-6)

[Charles Duke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Duke "Charles Duke") with a hammer on the lunar surface

[Apollo 15](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_15 "Apollo 15")[command module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_command_and_service_module "Apollo command and service module") pilot [Al Worden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Worden "Al Worden") made an EVA on August 5, 1971, on the return trip from the Moon, to retrieve a film and data recording canister from the service module. He was assisted by Lunar Module Pilot James Irwin standing up in the Command Module hatch. This procedure was repeated by [Ken Mattingly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Mattingly "Ken Mattingly") and Charles Duke on [Apollo 16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_16 "Apollo 16"), and by [Ronald Evans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Evans_(astronaut) "Ronald Evans (astronaut)") and Harrison Schmitt on [Apollo 17](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_17 "Apollo 17").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_activity#cite_note-portree-6)

The first EVA repairs of a spacecraft were made by [Charles "Pete" Conrad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Conrad "Pete Conrad"), [Joseph Kerwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_P._Kerwin "Joseph P. Kerwin"), and [Paul J. Weitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_J._Weitz "Paul J. Weitz") on May 26, June 7, and June 19, 1973, on the [Skylab 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skylab_2 "Skylab 2") mission. They rescued the functionality of the launch-damaged [Skylab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skylab "Skylab")[space station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station "Space station") by freeing a stuck [solar panel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_panels_on_spacecraft "Solar panels on spacecraft"), deploying a solar heating shield, and freeing a stuck circuit breaker relay. The Skylab 2 crew made three EVAs, and a total of ten EVAs were made by the three Skylab crews.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_activity#cite_note-portree-6) They found that activities in weightlessness required about 2 1⁄2 times longer than on Earth because many astronauts suffered [spacesickness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacesickness "Spacesickness") early in their flights.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_activity#cite_note-reusestudy-9)

After Skylab, no more EVAs were made by the United States until the advent of the [Space Shuttle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle "Space Shuttle") program in the early 1980s. In this period, the Soviets resumed EVAs, making four from the [Salyut 6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salyut_6 "Salyut 6") and [Salyut 7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salyut_7 "Salyut 7") space stations between December 20, 1977, and July 30, 1982.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_activity#cite_note-portree-6)

When the United States resumed EVAs on April 7, 1983, astronauts started using an [Extravehicular Mobility Unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_Mobility_Unit "Extravehicular Mobility Unit") (EMU) for self-contained life support independent of the spacecraft. STS-6 was the first Space Shuttle mission during which a spacewalk was conducted. Also, for the first time, American astronauts used an airlock to enter and exit the spacecraft like the Soviets. Accordingly, the American definition of EVA start time was redefined to when the astronaut switches the EMU to battery power.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_activity#cite_note-10)

Numerous EVAs were conducted during the assembly of the [ISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station "International Space Station"), often using the [Quest Joint Airlock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quest_Joint_Airlock "Quest Joint Airlock"), designed to support both U.S. EMUs, and Russian Orlan space suits.

Astronaut Fei Junlong performing a spacewalk on the Tiangong Space Station

[China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China "China") became the third [country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country "Country") to independently carry out an EVA on September 27, 2008, during the [Shenzhou 7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenzhou_7 "Shenzhou 7") mission. Chinese taikonaut [Zhai Zhigang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhai_Zhigang "Zhai Zhigang") completed a 22-minute spacewalk wearing the Chinese-developed [Feitian space suit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feitian_space_suit "Feitian space suit"), with taikonaut [Liu Boming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Boming_(astronaut) "Liu Boming (astronaut)") wearing the Russian-derived [Orlan space suit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlan_space_suit "Orlan space suit") assisting him in the process. Zhai completely exited the craft, while Liu stood by at the airlock, straddling the portal.

Since 2021, China has carried out several more EVAs lasting several hours for the construction of the [Tiangong space station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiangong_space_station "Tiangong space station"). In December 2024 China's [Cai Xuzhe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cai_Xuzhe "Cai Xuzhe") and [Song Lingdong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song_Lingdong "Song Lingdong") set the current record for the longest EVA at 9 hours and six minutes.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_activity#cite_note-:0-11)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_activity#cite_note-:1-12)

American company [SpaceX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX "SpaceX") conducted the first private sector-financed EVA on September 12, 2024. Entrepreneur [Jared Isaacman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Isaacman "Jared Isaacman") and SpaceX engineer [Sarah Gillis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Gillis "Sarah Gillis") briefly ventured outside a [Dragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon "SpaceX Dragon") capsule, for a stand-up EVA (SEVA) during the [Polaris Dawn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polaris_Dawn "Polaris Dawn") mission to conduct [spacesuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit "Space suit") mobility testing. [[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_activity#cite_note-13) The other two crew members were exposed to the vacuum of space in the capsule, but did not leave it.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_activity#cite_note-14) SpaceX plans to launch at least two more missions involving an EVA,[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_activity#cite_note-15) including one that involves SpaceX's still-in-development [Starship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship "SpaceX Starship") launch vehicle.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_activity#cite_note-16)

### Capability milestones

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Extravehicular_activity&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Capability milestones")]

*   The first untethered spacewalk was made by American [Bruce McCandless II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_McCandless_II "Bruce McCandless II") on February 7, 1984, during the [Space Shuttle _Challenger_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Challenger "Space Shuttle Challenger") mission [STS-41-B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-41-B "STS-41-B"), using the [Manned Maneuvering Unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manned_Maneuvering_Unit "Manned Maneuvering Unit"). He was subsequently joined by [Robert L. Stewart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_L._Stewart "Robert L. Stewart") during the 5-hour, 55-minute spacewalk. A self-contained spacewalk was first attempted by [Eugene Cernan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Cernan "Eugene Cernan") in 1966 on [Gemini 9A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_9A "Gemini 9A"), but Cernan could not reach the maneuvering unit without tiring.
*   The first metalwork in open space, consisting of welding, brazing and metal spraying, was conducted by Soviet cosmonauts [Svetlana Savitskaya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svetlana_Savitskaya "Svetlana Savitskaya") and [Vladimir Dzhanibekov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Dzhanibekov "Vladimir Dzhanibekov") on July 25, 1984. A specially designed multipurpose tool was used to perform these activities during a 3-hour, 30-minute EVA outside the Salyut 7 space station.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_activity#cite_note-Salyut7Welding1-17)[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_activity#cite_note-Salyut7Welding2-18)[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_activity#cite_note-Salyut7Welding3-19)
*   The first three-person EVA was performed on May 13, 1992, as the third EVA of [STS-49](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-49 "STS-49"), the maiden flight of _[Endeavour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space\_Shuttle\_Endeavour "Space Shuttle Endeavour")_.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_activity#cite_note-sts49-20)[Pierre Thuot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_J._Thuot "Pierre J. Thuot"), [Richard Hieb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hieb "Richard Hieb"), and [Thomas Akers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Akers "Thomas Akers") conducted the EVA to hand-capture and repair a non-functional [Intelsat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelsat "Intelsat") VI-F3 [satellite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite "Satellite"). As of 2021 it was the only three-person EVA.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_activity#cite_note-21)
*   The first EVA to perform an [in-flight repair of the Space Shuttle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-114#In-flight_repair "STS-114") was by American [Steve Robinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Robinson "Stephen Robinson") on August 3, 2005, during "Return to Flight" mission [STS-114](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-114 "STS-114"). Robinson was sent to remove two protruding gap fillers from [_Discovery_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Discovery "Space Shuttle Discovery")'s heat shield, after engineers determined there was a small chance they could affect the shuttle upon re-entry.

[Anatoly Solovyev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatoly_Solovyev "Anatoly Solovyev") holds the record for time spent during spacewalks: 82+ hours over 16 separate outings, seen here performing an EVA outside [Mir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mir "Mir") space station in 1997.

The first spacewalk, made by Soviet cosmonaut Alexei Leonov, was commemorated in 1965 with several Eastern Bloc stamps (see [Alexei Leonov#Stamps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexei_Leonov#Stamps "Alexei Leonov")). Since the Soviet Union did not publish details of the Voskhod spacecraft at the time, the spaceship depiction in the stamps was purely fictional.

The [U.S. Post Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Post_Office "U.S. Post Office") issued a postage stamp in 1967 commemorating [Ed White](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_White_(astronaut) "Ed White (astronaut)")'s first American spacewalk. The engraved image has an accurate depiction of the [Gemini IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_IV "Gemini IV") spacecraft and White's [space suit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit "Space suit").[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_activity#cite_note-31)

NASA "spacewalkers" during the Space Shuttle program were designated as EV-1, EV-2, EV-3 and EV-4 (assigned to mission specialists for each mission, if applicable).[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_activity#cite_note-32)[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_activity#cite_note-33)

For EVAs from the [International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station "International Space Station"), NASA employed a [_camp-out_ procedure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quest_Joint_Airlock#Camp-out_procedure "Quest Joint Airlock") to reduce the risk of decompression sickness.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_activity#cite_note-tanner-34) This was first tested by the Expedition 12 crew. During a camp-out, astronauts sleep overnight in the [airlock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quest_Joint_Airlock "Quest Joint Airlock") prior to an EVA, lowering the air pressure to 10.2 psi (70 kPa), compared to the normal station pressure of 14.7 psi (101 kPa).[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_activity#cite_note-tanner-34) Spending a night at the lower air pressure helps flush nitrogen from the body, thereby preventing "[the bends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decompression_sickness "Decompression sickness")".[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_activity#cite_note-35)[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_activity#cite_note-36) More recently astronauts have been using the In-Suit Light Exercise protocol rather than camp-out to prevent decompression sickness.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_activity#cite_note-37)[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_activity#cite_note-38)
