It is the most distant T dwarf discovered to date (about 4.5 or 4.8 kpc ).

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] UNCOVER-BD-1 was discovered [ 1 ] [ 2 ] in a deep James Webb Space Telescope field called UNCOVER ( Ultradeep NIRSpec and NIRCam ObserVations before the Epoch of Reionization ), which targets the galaxy cluster Abell 2744 and is primarily used to study galaxies . As the name says, the UNCOVER team used NIRCam to take images and NIRSpec multiobject prism spectroscopy to take spectra of any object detected in the field.

[ 3 ] The object was independently discovered by two teams. Both teams also discovered two other distant T-dwarfs.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Langeroodi & Hjorth concluded from its position and distance that UNCOVER-BD-1 likely is located outside the thin disk of the Milky Way .

[ 1 ] Burgasser et al. found a high probability (76%) of it being a thick disk member, and a moderate probability (24%) of it being a halo member. This team also found that it is likely a subdwarf and comparison with the extreme subdwarf WISEA 1810−1010 produced a better fit to the widened 1.1 μm absorption feature. This could also mean that UNCOVER-BD-1 is colder and closer than currently estimated. The spectrum in their work has several absorption features from molecules labelled. Those are methane (CH 4 ), water vapor (H 2 O), carbon monoxide (CO) and collision induced absorption by hydrogen molecules (H 2 ).

[ 2 ] Langeroodi & Hjorth find a low mass of around 5 M J , but they also do not consider it as a subdwarf, [ 1 ] which might influence the estimates of physical properties.
