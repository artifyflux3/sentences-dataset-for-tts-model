[ 1 ] [ 2 ] : 4 In a conceptual space, points denote objects, and regions denote concepts. The theory of conceptual spaces is a theory about concept learning first proposed by Peter Gärdenfors .

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] It is motivated by notions such as conceptual similarity and prototype theory .

The theory also puts forward the notion that natural categories are convex regions in conceptual spaces.

[ 1 ] : 5 In that if x {\displaystyle x} and y {\displaystyle y} are elements of a category, and if z {\displaystyle z} is between x {\displaystyle x} and y {\displaystyle y} , then z {\displaystyle z} is also likely to belong to the category. The notion of concept convexity allows the interpretation of the focal points of regions as category prototypes . In the more general formulations of the theory, concepts are defined in terms conceptual similarity to their prototypes. Conceptual spaces have found applications in both cognitive modelling and artificial intelligence .
