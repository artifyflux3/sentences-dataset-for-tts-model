Beaters usually are unarmed, but may be accompanied with dogs. In Germany, high-visibility clothing is compulsory for beaters, for safety reasons.

Traditions [ edit ] In Holy Roman Empire there was a beater duty during lordly hunts, and there was a special tax for the Jews, called de:Federlappengeld , paid to exempt them from the duty.

[ 3 ] The expression " wikt:beat about the bush " or "beat around the bush" comes from the method of fowling when beaters beat about the bush where the flock is roosting.

[ 4 ] Beaters can wave flags on the ends of the drive line, to make the fowl stay within the shooting range.
