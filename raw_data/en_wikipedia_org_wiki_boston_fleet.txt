They are one of the six charter franchises of the league. The team plays its home games at Tsongas Center .

History [ edit ] Founding and inaugural season [ edit ] On August 29, 2023, it was announced that one of the PWHL's first six franchises would be located in Boston.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] This ensured the continuation of professional women's hockey in the area after the folding of the Boston Pride and the Premier Hockey Federation earlier that summer; the Pride had been that league's most successful franchise, winning three Isobel Cup championships.

[ 3 ] Danielle Marmer , a former scout and player development assistant for the National Hockey League 's Boston Bruins , was named PWHL Boston's inaugural general manager.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] On September 15, Boston University women's team associate head coach Courtney Birchard-Kessel was announced as the team's first head coach .

[ 6 ] The team's first three player signings were United States national team players Hilary Knight , Aerin Frankel , and Megan Keller , all signed to three-year deals.

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] Boston's first selection in the 2023 PWHL Draft , held on September 18, was Swiss forward Alina Müller , taken third overall.

[ 9 ] In November, it was revealed that the team's colors would be green, gray, and white.

[ 10 ] It was also revealed that the team would host home games at the Tsongas Center in Lowell.

[ 11 ] Boston's Aerin Frankel makes a save in 2024.

Ahead of the start of the inaugural 2024 season , former Boston Bruins captain Patrice Bergeron introduced Knight as Boston's captain; Keller and Jamie Lee Rattray were introduced as alternate captains.

[ 12 ] The team hosted its inaugural game against Minnesota Frost on January 3, 2024.

[ 13 ] The team's first ever goal was scored by Theresa Schafzahl , 7:59 into the 2nd period.

[ 14 ] Minnesota ultimately won the game by a score of 3–2.

[ 15 ] Boston's first victory came in a 3–2 overtime decision against Montreal Victoire on January 13.

[ 16 ] Boston went on to finish third in the league standings, clinching a playoff spot in their final regular season game.

[ 17 ] In the first round of the playoffs, Boston faced Montreal. Boston went on to defeat Montreal in three straight games, with all three victories coming in overtime.

[ 18 ] Boston advanced to the championship series, where they faced Minnesota. Goaltender Aerin Frankel led the playoffs in saves.

[ 19 ] However, Boston lost a close five-game series, with Minnesota clinching the Walter Cup championship in Lowell on May 29.

[ 20 ] On June 23, 2025, Birchard-Kessel left the Fleet and was named the head coach for the Princeton Tigers women's ice hockey team.

[ 21 ] On July 23, 2025, Kris Sparre was named the second head coach in program history.

[ 22 ] Season-by-season record [ edit ] Key of colors and symbols Color/symbol Explanation † Indicates League Championship * Indicates regular Championship Year by year results Season GP RW OW OL RL Pts GF GA GD Finish Playoffs 2023–24 24 8 4 3 9 35 50 57 -7 3rd Lost Walter Cup Finals, 2–3 ( PWHL Minnesota ) 2024–25 30 9 6 5 10 44 75 76 -1 5th Did not qualify Team identity [ edit ] Inaugural season logo for PWHL Boston.

Boston operated without unique branding for the league's inaugural season, like all charter franchises. The team was known as PWHL Boston and wore a league-wide jersey template that featured the city's name diagonally on the front.

[ 23 ] The team did have its own color scheme, featuring green and black. In October 2023, the league registered a trademark for the name Boston Wicked, which proved unpopular with fans when leaked.

[ 24 ] [ 25 ] In September 2024, the team was instead given the name Fleet, in reference to Boston's maritime tradition; the team's logo features a stylized letter 'B' doubling as an anchor.

[ 25 ] [ 26 ] The team retained its color scheme, adding additional shades of green.

The Hockey News reported that other names in contention for Boston, before settling on Fleet, included Emeralds and Blitz.

[ 27 ] Players and personnel [ edit ] Current roster [ edit ] As of April 26, 2025 [ 28 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] [ 32 ] No.
