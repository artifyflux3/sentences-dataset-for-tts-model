Career [ edit ] Anna Frebel grew up in Göttingen , Germany.

[ 1 ] After finishing high school, she began studying physics in Freiburg im Breisgau but did not finish the physics program and did not obtain a physics degree there. Instead she enrolled in an astronomy program in Australia, where she obtained a PhD in Astronomy from the Australian National University 's Mount Stromlo Observatory in Canberra. Shortly thereafter, a W. J. McDonald Postdoctoral Fellowship brought her to the University of Texas at Austin in 2006, where she continued her studies.

[ 2 ] From 2009 to 2011, she was a Clay Postdoctoral Fellow at the Harvard–Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge (MA).

In 2012 she moved to Massachusetts Institute of Technology , achieving promotion to full professor in 2022.

[ 3 ] Discoveries [ edit ] In 2005, Frebel discovered the star HE 1327-2326 , which is the most iron-deficient star, stemming from a time very shortly after the Big Bang . In 2007 she also discovered the red giant star HE 1523-0901 , which is about 13.2 billion years old.
