[ 1 ] [ 2 ] The fossil of Allocordyceps baltica , from the Baltic Amber , represents the oldest known fossil of an ant -parasitizing fungus before Ophiocordyceps .

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] Carpenter ants, similar to the host parasitized by A. baltica Description [ edit ] Allocordyceps is characterized by its ascoma being an orange color, stalked and cusp shaped. It also has a pair of partially immersed perithecia that emerges from the rectum . Hosts parasitized by Allocordyceps have separate stromata with separate mycelium emerging from the neck and abdomen.

[ 4 ] It may have altered its host's behavior similarly to the extant Ophiocordyceps unilateralis .
