[ 1 ] [ 2 ] The study of inorganic compounds is a subfield of chemistry known as inorganic chemistry .

Inorganic compounds comprise most of the Earth's crust , although the compositions of the deep mantle remain active areas of investigation.

[ 3 ] All allotropes (structurally different pure forms of an element) and some simple carbon compounds are often considered inorganic. Examples include the allotropes of carbon ( graphite , diamond , buckminsterfullerene , graphene , etc.), carbon monoxide CO , carbon dioxide CO 2 , carbides , and salts of inorganic anions such as carbonates , cyanides , cyanates , thiocyanates , isothiocyanates , etc. Many of these are normal parts of mostly organic systems, including organisms ; describing a chemical as inorganic does not necessarily mean that it cannot occur within living things.

History [ edit ] Friedrich Wöhler 's conversion of ammonium cyanate into urea in 1828 is often cited as the starting point of modern organic chemistry .

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] In Wöhler's era, there was widespread belief that organic compounds were characterized by a vital spirit .  In the absence of vitalism, the distinction between inorganic and organic chemistry is merely semantic.

Modern usage [ edit ] The Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD) in its definition of "inorganic" carbon compounds, states that such compounds may contain either C-H or C-C bonds, but not both.

[ 7 ] The book series Inorganic Syntheses does not define inorganic compounds. The majority of its content deals with metal complexes of organic ligands.

[ 8 ] IUPAC does not offer a definition of "inorganic" or "inorganic compound" but does define inorganic polymer as "...skeletal structure that does not include carbon atoms."
