Skorokhod is well-known for his comprehensive treatise on the theory of stochastic processes which he co-authored with Gikhman .

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Career [ edit ] Skorokhod worked at Kyiv University from 1956 to 1964. He was subsequently at the Institute of Mathematics of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine from 1964 until 2002. Since 1993, he had been a professor at Michigan State University in the US, and a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences .

[ 5 ] He was an academician of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine from 1985 up to his death in 2011.

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] His scientific works are on the theory of: stochastic differential equations , limit theorems of random processes , distributions in infinite-dimensional spaces , statistics of random processes and Markov processes .

Skorokhod authored over 450 scientific works, including more than 40 monographs and books.

Many terms and concepts have his name, specifically: Skorokhod space ( Skorokhod space ) Skorokhod integral Skorokhod problem Skorokhod's embedding theorem Skorokhod's representation theorem Selected works [ edit ] with I.
