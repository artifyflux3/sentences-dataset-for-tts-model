In this context, a scene is defined as sensory information that can flow from a physical environment into a computational system via sensory transduction . A sensory organ (biological or artificial) is used to capture this information. Therefore, a perceptual system must incorporate input from at least one sensory organ.

Examples of perceptual systems include: The visual system The auditory system The olfactory system The somatosensory system A bat 's sonar / echolocation system A man-made light meter A man-made motion detector Research in the field of perceptual systems focuses on computational aspects of perception . For this reason, there is significant overlap with neuroscience , sensor design, natural scene statistics , [ 1 ] [ 2 ] and computer science .
