[ 3 ] Like the other Ivy League colleges, Harvard does not offer athletic scholarships .

[ 4 ] Athletics at Harvard began in 1780 when the sophomores challenged the freshmen to a wrestling tournament with the losers buying dinner. Since its historic boat race against archrival Yale in 1852, Harvard has been in the forefront of American intercollegiate sports. Its football team conceived the modern version of the game and devised essentials ranging from the first concrete stadium to a scoreboard to uniform numbers to signals.

[ 5 ] Originally inspired by varsity matches between Oxford University and Cambridge University in England, Harvard and Yale influenced the development of college sports in the United States.

Representing Harvard Crimson, Benjamin (Benji) Ungar won Gold in the 2006 Individual Men's Épée event at the NCAA Fencing Championship, and was named Harvard Athlete of The Year.

[ 8 ] In 2020, the fencing program received more attention following a student admission scandal which involved former fencing coach Peter Brand accepting bribes to admit at least two sons of Maryland businessman Jie “Jack” Zhao into Harvard as members of the fencing team.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] Football [ edit ] Main article: Harvard Crimson football See also: Harvard-Yale football rivalry Harvard football taking on Brown at Harvard Stadium in September 2009 The football team has competed since 1873, initially using rugby union rules through 1882.

[ 12 ] They have won ten national championships when the school competed in what is now known as the FBS .

[ 13 ] They are perhaps best known for their rivalry with Yale , known as " The Game ". Sixteen former players have been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame .

Harvard's athletic rivalry with Yale is intense in every sport in which they meet, coming to a climax each fall in their annual football meeting, which dates back to 1875. While Harvard's football team is no longer one of the country's best as it often was a century ago during football's early days (it won the Rose Bowl in 1920), both it and Yale have influenced the way the game is played. In 1903, Harvard Stadium introduced a new era into football with the first-ever permanent reinforced concrete stadium of its kind in the country. The stadium's structure actually played a role in the evolution of the college game. Seeking to reduce the alarming number of deaths and serious injuries in the sport, the "Father of Football", Walter Camp (former captain of the Yale football team), suggested widening the field to open up the game. But the state-of-the-art Harvard Stadium was too narrow to accommodate a wider playing surface. So, other steps had to be taken. Camp would instead support revolutionary new rules for the 1906 season. These included legalizing the forward pass , perhaps the most significant rule change in the sport's history.

[ 14 ] [ 15 ] In both 1919 and 1920, headed by All-American brothers Arnold Horween and Ralph Horween , Harvard was undefeated (9–0–1, as they outscored their competition 229–19, and 8–0–1, respectively).

[ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] The team won the 1920 Rose Bowl 7–6 over the University of Oregon .

[ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] It was the only bowl appearance in Harvard history.

[ 22 ] Golf [ edit ] Harvard has won six national collegiate team championships : 1898 (fall), [ 23 ] 1899, 1901, 1902 (fall), 1903, and 1904. They have crowned eight individual national champions: James Curtis (1898, fall), Halstead Lindsley (1901), Chandler Egan (1902, fall), A. L. White (1904), H. H. Wilder (1908), F. C. Davison (1912), Edward Allis (1914), J. W. Hubbell (1916). They won the inaugural Ivy League championship in 1975, their only league championship.

[ 24 ] Ice hockey [ edit ] Men's ice hockey [ edit ] Main article: Harvard Crimson men's ice hockey See also: Cornell–Harvard hockey rivalry Harvard men's ice hockey team in 2023 The men's ice hockey team is one of the oldest intercollegiate ice hockey teams in the United States, having played their first game on January 19, 1898 in a 0–6 loss to Brown .

[ 25 ] Former head coach William H. Claflin and former captain George Owen are credited with the first use of line change in a game against Yale on March 3, 1923 when the Crimson substituted entire forward lines instead of individuals.

[ 26 ] The men's ice hockey team won the NCAA Division I Championship on April 1, 1989, defeating the Minnesota Golden Gophers 4–3 in overtime.

[ 27 ] The Cleary Cup , awarded to the ECAC regular-season champion, is named for former Harvard All-American hockey player, coach, and athletic director Bill Cleary , a member of the U.S. hockey team that won the 1960 Winter Olympics gold medal . The team competes in ECAC Hockey along with five other Ivy League schools and is coached by Harvard alumnus, Olympian , and former NHL forward, Ted Donato .

[ 28 ] Harvard competes in one of the most heated rivalries of college hockey at least twice each season against Harvard's archrival, the Cornell Big Red , in installments of the Cornell–Harvard hockey rivalry . Cornell and Harvard are the most storied programs currently in the ECAC.

It is held annually in June on the Thames river in eastern Connecticut. Both the Harvard heavyweight and lightweight teams are typically considered to be among the top teams in the country in rowing , having won numerous national championships in recent years.

For a time the Harvard lightweight men's team had one of the "oddest" streaks in collegiate sports, having won the national championships in every odd year from 1989 to 2003 (and in no corresponding even years).

[ 31 ] [ 32 ] The streak was broken when Harvard lost to Yale by almost 4 seconds in 2005.

[ 33 ] The women's heavyweight rowing team were NCAA Champions in 2003.

Perhaps more than any other two colleges, Harvard and Yale gave form to American intercollegiate athletics--a form that was inspired by the Oxford-Cambridge rivalry overseas, and that was imitated by colleges and universities throughout the United States. Focusing on the influence of these prestigious eastern institutions, this fascinating study traces the origins and development of intercollegiate athletics in America from the mid-nineteenth century to the early twentieth century.
