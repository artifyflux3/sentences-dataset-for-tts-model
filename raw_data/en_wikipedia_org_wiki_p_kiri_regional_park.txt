Sand dredging [ edit ] Since the 1940s, sand from Pākiri beach as been dredged for use in Auckland’s concrete industry, by companies such as McCallum Brothers and Kaipara Limited.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] However in 2005, when the park was purchased by the Auckland Regional Council , dredging ceased due to concerns of the erosion caused.

[ 7 ] [ 5 ] A resource consent application in 2022 to continue dredging was rejected by Auckland Council.

[ 6 ] In 2024, a sand mining company appealed to continue dredging the coastline. This was overruled by the Environment Court under grounds that evidence could not be shown that sand mining was not having an harmful impact.
