[ 5 ] Trinidad and Tobago , [ a ] officially the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago , is the southernmost island country in the Caribbean , comprising the main islands of Trinidad and Tobago , along with several smaller islets . The capital city is Port of Spain , while its largest and most populous municipality is Chaguanas . Despite its proximity to South America , Trinidad and Tobago is generally considered to be part of the Caribbean.

Trinidad and Tobago is located 11 kilometres (6 nautical miles) northeast off the coast of Venezuela , 130 kilometres (70 nautical miles) south of Grenada , and 288 kilometres (155 nautical miles) southwest of Barbados .

[ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] Indigenous peoples inhabited Trinidad for centuries prior to Spanish colonization , following the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1498. Spanish governor José María Chacón surrendered the island to a British fleet under Sir Ralph Abercromby 's command in 1797.

[ 13 ] Trinidad and Tobago were ceded to Britain in 1802 under the Treaty of Amiens as separate states and unified in 1889.

[ 14 ] Trinidad and Tobago obtained independence in 1962, and became a republic in 1976.

[ 15 ] [ 10 ] Unlike most Caribbean nations and territories, which rely heavily on tourism, the economy is primarily industrial, based on large reserves of oil and gas .

[ 16 ] [ 17 ] The country experiences fewer hurricanes than most of the Caribbean because it is farther south.

Trinidad and Tobago is well known for its African and Indian Caribbean cultures, reflected in its large and famous Trinidad and Tobago Carnival , Hosay , and Diwali celebrations, as well as being the birthplace of the steelpan , the limbo , and musical styles such as calypso , soca , rapso , chutney music , and chutney soca .

Toponymy [ edit ] Historian E. L. Joseph claimed that Trinidad's Indigenous name was Cairi or "Land of the Humming Bird ", derived from the Arawak name for hummingbird, ierèttê or yerettê . However, other authors dispute this etymology with some claiming that cairi does not mean hummingbird ( tukusi or tucuchi being suggested as the correct word) and some claiming that kairi , or iere , simply means island .

[ 18 ] Christopher Columbus renamed it "La Isla de la Trinidad" ("The Island of the Trinity "), fulfilling a vow made before setting out on his third voyage of exploration.

[ 19 ] Tobago's cigar-like shape, or the use of tobacco by the native people, may have given it its Spanish name ( cabaco , tavaco , tobacco ) and possibly some of its other Indigenous names, such as Aloubaéra (black conch) and Urupaina (big snail), [ 18 ] although the English pronunciation is /təˈbeɪɡoʊ/ .

Indo-Trinidadians called the island Chinidat or Chinidad which translated to the "land of sugar". The usage of the term goes back to the 19th century when recruiters in India would call the island Chinidat as a way of luring workers into indentureship on the sugar plantations.

[ 20 ] History [ edit ] Main article: History of Trinidad and Tobago Geological history [ edit ] The islands that make up modern-day Trinidad and Tobago lie at the southern end of the Lesser Antilles group. The islands lie close to the continent of South America, separated by the Gulf of Paria .

Indigenous peoples [ edit ] Trinidad and Tobago were originally settled by Indigenous peoples migrating from South America .

[ 10 ] The earliest known settlement is at Banwari Trace in southwestern Trinidad , dating back to approximately 5000 BCE, making it the oldest pre-Columbian archaeological site in the Caribbean .

[ 21 ] The site has yielded artifacts and the remains of "Banwari Man," the oldest human skeleton found in the region.

[ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] At the time of European contact, Trinidad was inhabited by various Indigenous groups, including Arawakan -speaking peoples such as the Nepoya and Suppoya, and Cariban -speaking groups like the Yao.

[ 26 ] Tobago was primarily occupied by the Island Caribs and the Galibi .

European colonization [ edit ] Main articles: Columbian Viceroyalty , New Spain , and Captaincy General of Cuba Christopher Columbus was the first European to see Trinidad, on his third voyage to the Americas in 1498.

[ 21 ] [ 27 ] He also reported seeing Tobago on the distant horizon, naming it Bellaforma , but did not land on the island.

[ 10 ] [ 28 ] English pirate Walter Raleigh raiding Spanish settlement in Trinidad in 1595 In the 1530s Antonio de Sedeño, a Spanish soldier intent on conquering the island of Trinidad, landed on its southwest coast with a small army of men, intending to subdue the Indigenous population of the island. Sedeño and his men fought the native peoples on many occasions, and subsequently built a fort. The next few decades were generally spent in warfare with the native peoples, until in 1592, the "Cacique" (native chief) Wannawanare (also known as Guanaguanare) granted the area around modern Saint Joseph to Domingo de Vera e Ibargüen, and withdrew to another part of the island.

[ 18 ] [ 29 ] The settlement of San José de Oruña was later established by Antonio de Berrío on this land in 1592.

[ 10 ] [ 21 ] Shortly thereafter the English pirate Walter Raleigh arrived in Trinidad on 22 March 1595 in search of the long-rumoured " El Dorado " ("City of Gold") supposedly located in South America.

[ 21 ] He attacked San José, captured and interrogated Antonio de Berrío, and obtained much information from him and from the Cacique Topiawari; Raleigh then went on his way, and Spanish authority was restored.

[ 30 ] Meanwhile, there were numerous attempts by European powers to settle Tobago during the 1620–40s, with the Dutch, English and Couronians (people from the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia , now part of Latvia ) all attempting to colonise the island with little success.

[ 31 ] [ 32 ] From 1654 the Dutch and Courlanders managed to gain a more secure foothold, later joined by several hundred French settlers.

[ 31 ] A plantation economy developed based on the production of sugar, indigo and rum, worked by large numbers of African slaves who soon came to vastly outnumber the European colonists.

[ 32 ] [ 31 ] Large numbers of forts were constructed as Tobago became a source of contention between France, Netherlands and Britain, with the island changing hands some 31 times prior to 1814, a situation exacerbated by widespread piracy.

[ 32 ] The British managed to hold Tobago from 1762 to 1781, whereupon it was captured by the French, who ruled until 1793 when Britain re-captured the island.

[ 32 ] The 17th century on Trinidad passed largely without major incident, but sustained attempts by the Spaniards to control and rule over the Indigenous population was often fiercely resisted.

[ 21 ] In 1687 the Catholic Catalan Capuchin friars were given responsibility for the conversions of the indigenous people of Trinidad and the Guianas .

[ 21 ] They founded several missions in Trinidad, supported and richly funded by the state, which also granted encomienda right to them over the native peoples, in which the native peoples were forced to provide labour for the Spanish.

[ 21 ] One such mission was Santa Rosa de Arima, established in 1689, when Indigenous people from the former encomiendas of Tacarigua and Arauca ( Arouca ) were relocated further west.

[ citation needed ] Escalating tensions between the Spaniards and Indigenous people culminated in violence in 1689, when Indigenous people in the San Rafael encomienda rebelled and killed several priests, attacked a church, and killed the Spanish governor José de León y Echales . Among those killed in the governor's party was Juan Mazien de Sotomayor, missionary priest to the Nepuyo villages of Caura, Tacarigua and Arauca.

[ 33 ] The Spanish retaliated severely, slaughtering hundreds of native peoples in an event that became known as the Arena massacre .

[ 21 ] As a result of continuing Spanish slave-raiding, and the devastating impact of introduced disease to which they had no immunity, the native population was virtually wiped out by the end of the following century.

[ 34 ] [ 21 ] During this period Trinidad was an island province belonging to the Viceroyalty of New Spain , together with Central America, present-day Mexico and what would later become the southwestern United States .

[ 35 ] In 1757 the capital was moved from San José de Oruña to Puerto de España (modern Port of Spain ) following several pirate attacks.

[ 36 ] However the Spanish never made any concerted effort to colonise the islands; Trinidad in this period was still mostly forest, populated by a few Spaniards with a handful of slaves and a few thousand Indigenous people.

[ 35 ] Indeed, the population in 1777 was only 1,400, and Spanish colonisation in Trinidad remained tenuous.

[ citation needed ] Influx of French settlers [ edit ] Main article: French West Indies In 1777, the captain general Luis de Unzaga 'le Conciliateur', married to a French Creole, allowed free trade in Trinidad, attracting French settlers and its economy improved notably.

[ 37 ] Since Trinidad was considered underpopulated, Roume de St. Laurent, a Frenchman living in Grenada , was able to obtain a Cédula de Población from the Spanish king Charles III on 4 November 1783.

[ 38 ] A Cédula de Población had previously been granted in 1776 by the king, but had not shown results, and therefore the new Cédula was more generous.

[ 10 ] It granted free land and tax exemption for 10 years to Roman Catholic foreign settlers who were willing to swear allegiance to the King of Spain.

[ 10 ] The land grant was 30 fanegas (13 hectares/32 acres) for each free man, woman and child and half of that for each slave that they brought with them. The Spanish sent a new governor, José María Chacón , to implement the terms of the new cédula .

[ 38 ] [ 39 ] [ 40 ] [ 41 ] The Cédula was issued only a few years before the French Revolution . During that period of upheaval, French planters with their slaves, free coloureds and mulattos from the neighbouring islands of Martinique , Saint Lucia , Grenada, Guadeloupe and Dominica migrated to Trinidad, where they established an agriculture-based economy (sugar and cocoa).

[ 35 ] These new immigrants established local communities in Blanchisseuse , Champs Fleurs, Paramin , [ 42 ] Cascade, Carenage and Laventille .

As a result, Trinidad's population jumped to over 15,000 by the end of 1789, and by 1797 the population of Port of Spain had increased from under 3,000 to 10,422 in just five years, with a varied population of mixed race individuals, Spaniards, Africans, French republican soldiers, retired pirates and French nobility.

[ 35 ] The total population of Trinidad was 17,718, of which 2,151 were of European ancestry, 4,476 were "free blacks and people of colour", 10,009 were enslaved people and 1,082 Indigenous people.

[ citation needed ] The sparse settlement and slow rate of population-increase during Spanish rule (and even later during British rule) made Trinidad one of the less populated colonies of the West Indies, with the least developed plantation infrastructure.

[ 43 ] British rule [ edit ] Main articles: British West Indies and British Windward Islands A medallion showing the capture of Trinidad and Tobago by the British in 1797.

The British had begun to take a keen interest in Trinidad, and in 1797 a British force led by General Sir Ralph Abercromby launched an invasion of Trinidad .

[ 10 ] [ 44 ] His squadron sailed through the Bocas and anchored off the coast of Chaguaramas . Seriously outnumbered, Chacón decided to capitulate to the British without fighting.

[ 44 ] Trinidad thus became a British crown colony , with a largely French-speaking population and Spanish laws.

[ 35 ] British rule was later formalised under the Treaty of Amiens (1802).

[ 10 ] [ 44 ] The colony's first British governor was Thomas Picton , however his heavy-handed approach to enforcing British authority, including the use of torture and arbitrary arrest , led to his being recalled.

[ 44 ] [ better source needed ] Survey map from 1797 of Trinidad British rule led to an influx of settlers from the United Kingdom and the British colonies of the Eastern Caribbean. English, Scots, Irish, German and Italian families arrived, as well as some free blacks known as " Merikins " who had fought for Britain in the War of 1812 and were granted land in southern Trinidad.

[ 45 ] [ 46 ] [ 47 ] Under British rule, new states were created and the importation of slaves increased, however by this time support for abolitionism had vastly increased and in England the slave trade was under attack.

[ 43 ] [ 48 ] Slavery was abolished in 1833 , after which former slaves served an " apprenticeship " period. In 1837, Daaga, a West African slave trader who had been captured by Portuguese slavers and later rescued by the British navy, was conscripted into the local regiment. Daaga and a group of his compatriots mutinied at the barracks in St Joseph and set out eastward in an attempt to return to their homeland. The mutineers were ambushed by a militia unit just outside the town of Arima. The revolt was crushed at the cost of some 40 dead, and Daaga and his party were later executed at St Joseph.

[ 49 ] The apprenticeship system ended on 1 August 1838 with full emancipation.

[ 10 ] [ 47 ] An overview of the population statistics in 1838, however, clearly reveals the contrast between Trinidad and its neighbouring islands: upon emancipation of the slaves in 1838, Trinidad had only 17,439 slaves, with 80% of slave owners having enslaved fewer than 10 people each.

[ 50 ] In contrast, at twice the size of Trinidad, Jamaica had roughly 360,000 slaves.

[ 51 ] Arrival of Indian indentured labourers [ edit ] Newly arrived indentured Indian labourers in Trinidad and Tobago.

After the African slaves were emancipated many refused to continue working on the plantations, often moving out to urban areas such as Laventille and Belmont to the east of Port of Spain.

[ 47 ] As a result, a severe agricultural labour shortage emerged. The British filled this gap by instituting a system of indentureship . Various nationalities were contracted under this system, including Indians, Chinese, and Portuguese.

[ 52 ] Of these, the East Indians were imported in the largest numbers, starting from 1 May 1845, when 225 Indians were brought in the first ship to Trinidad on the Fatel Razack , a Muslim-owned vessel.

[ 47 ] [ 53 ] Indentureship of the Indians lasted from 1845 to 1917, during which time more than 147,000 Indians came to Trinidad to work on sugarcane plantations.

[ 10 ] [ 54 ] Indentureship contracts were sometimes exploitative, to such an extent that historians such as Hugh Tinker were to call it "a new system of slavery". Despite these descriptions, it was not truly a new form of slavery, as workers were paid, contracts were finite, and the idea of an individual being another's property had been eliminated when slavery was abolished.

[ 55 ] In addition, employers of indentured labour had no legal right to flog or whip their workers; the main legal sanction for the enforcement of the indenture laws was prosecution in the courts, followed by fines or (more likely) jail sentences.

[ 56 ] People were contracted for a period of five years, with a daily wage as low as 25 cents in the early 20th century, and they were guaranteed return passage to India at the end of their contract period. However, coercive means were often used to retain labourers, and the indentureship contracts were soon extended to 10 years from 1854 after the planters complained that they were losing their labour too early.

[ 43 ] [ 47 ] In lieu of the return passage, the British authorities soon began offering portions of land to encourage settlement, and by 1902, more than half of the sugar cane in Trinidad was being produced by independent cane farmers; the majority of which were Indians.

[ 57 ] Despite the trying conditions experienced under the indenture system, about 90% of the Indian immigrants chose, at the end of their contracted periods of indenture, to make Trinidad their permanent home.

[ 58 ] Indians entering the colony were also subject to certain crown laws which segregated them from the rest of Trinidad and Tobago's population, such as the requirement that they carry a pass with them if they left the plantations, and that if freed, they carry their "Free Papers" or certificate indicating completion of the indenture period.

An ongoing economic slump in the middle-to-late 19th century caused widespread poverty.

[ 60 ] Discontent erupted into rioting on the Roxborough plantation in 1876, in an event known as the Belmanna Uprising after a policeman who was killed.

[ 60 ] The British eventually managed to restore control; however, as a result of the disturbances Tobago's Legislative Assembly voted to dissolve itself and the island became a Crown colony in 1877.

[ 60 ] With the sugar industry in a state of near-collapse and the island no longer profitable, the British attached Tobago to their Trinidad colony in 1889.

[ 10 ] [ 61 ] [ 62 ] Early 20th century [ edit ] The Queen on 1953 stamps of Trinidad and Tobago In 1903, a protest against the introduction of new water rates in Port of Spain erupted into rioting; 18 people were shot dead, and the Red House (the government headquarters) was damaged by fire.

[ 61 ] A local elected assembly with some limited powers was introduced in 1913.

[ 61 ] Economically Trinidad and Tobago remained a predominantly agricultural colony; alongside sugarcane, the cacao ( cocoa ) crop also contributed greatly to economic earnings in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

In November 1919, the dockworkers went on strike over bad management practices, low wages compared to a higher cost of living.

[ 63 ] Strikebreakers were brought in to keep a minimum of goods moving through the ports. On 1 December 1919, the striking dockworkers rushed the harbour and chased off the strikebreakers.

[ 63 ] They then proceeded to march on the government buildings in Port of Spain. Other unions and workers, many with the same grievances, joined the dock worker's strike making it a General Strike.

[ 63 ] Violence broke out and was only put down with help from the sailors of British Naval ship HMS Calcutta . The unity brought upon by the strike was the first time of cooperation between the various ethnic groups of the time.

[ 64 ] Historian Brinsley Samaroo says that the 1919 strikes "seem to indicate that there was a growing class consciousness after the war and this transcended racial feelings at times." [ 64 ] However, in the 1920s, the collapse of the sugarcane industry, concomitant with the failure of the cocoa industry, resulted in widespread depression among the rural and agricultural workers in Trinidad, and encouraged the rise of a labour movement. Conditions on the islands worsened in the 1930s with the onset of the Great Depression , with an outbreak of labour riots occurring in 1937 which resulted in several deaths.

[ 65 ] The labour movement aimed to unite the urban working class and agricultural labour class; the key figures being Arthur Cipriani , who led the Trinidad Labour Party (TLP), Tubal Uriah "Buzz" Butler of the British Empire Citizens' and Workers' Home Rule Party , and Adrian Cola Rienzi , who led the Trinidad Citizens League (TCL), Oilfields Workers' Trade Union , and All Trinidad Sugar Estates and Factory Workers Union .

[ 65 ] As the movement developed calls for greater autonomy from British colonial rule became widespread; this effort was severely undermined by the British Home Office and by the British-educated Trinidadian elite, many of whom were descended from the plantocracy class.

A soldier at Waller Air Force Base , leased by Britain to America in the 1940s Petroleum had been discovered in 1857, but became economically significant only in the 1930s and afterwards as a result of the collapse of sugarcane and cocoa, and increasing industrialization.

[ 66 ] [ 67 ] [ 68 ] By the 1950s petroleum had become a staple in Trinidad's export market, and was responsible for a growing middle class among all sections of the Trinidad population. The collapse of Trinidad's major agricultural commodities, followed by the Depression, and the rise of the oil economy, led to major changes in the country's social structure.

The presence of American military bases in Chaguaramas and Cumuto in Trinidad during World War II had a profound effect on society. The Americans vastly improved the infrastructure on Trinidad and provided many locals with well-paying jobs. The Americans left in 1961.

[ 69 ] In the post-war period the British began a process of decolonisation across the British Empire. In 1945 universal suffrage was introduced to Trinidad and Tobago.

[ 10 ] [ 61 ] Political parties emerged on the island, however these were largely divided along racial lines: Afro-Trinidadians and Tobagonians primarily supported the People's National Movement (PNM), formed in 1956 by Eric Williams , with Indo-Trinidadians and Tobagonians mostly supporting the People's Democratic Party (PDP), formed in 1953 by Bhadase Sagan Maraj , [ 70 ] which later merged into the Democratic Labour Party (DLP) in 1957.

[ 71 ] Britain's Caribbean colonies formed the West Indies Federation in 1958 as a vehicle for independence, however the Federation dissolved after Jamaica withdrew following a membership referendum in 1961. The government of Trinidad and Tobago subsequently chose to seek independence from the United Kingdom on its own.

[ 72 ] Contemporary era [ edit ] Further information: West Indies Federation , Trinidad and Tobago Independence Act 1962 , Jamaat al Muslimeen coup attempt , Black Power Revolution , and National Union of Freedom Fighters Leaders at Independence Elizabeth II Monarch Eric Williams Prime Minister Trinidad and Tobago gained its independence from the United Kingdom on 31 August 1962.

[ 10 ] [ 68 ] However, Elizabeth II remained head of state, represented locally by Governor-General Solomon Hochoy , until the passage of the 1976 Republican Constitution.

[ 73 ] Eric Williams of the People's National Movement became the first Prime Minister , serving in that capacity uninterrupted until 1981.

[ 10 ] The dominant figure in the opposition in the early independence years was Opposition Leader Rudranath Capildeo of the Democratic Labour Party . The first Speaker of the House of Representatives was Clytus Arnold Thomasos and the first President of the Senate was J. Hamilton Maurice. The 1960s saw the rise of a Black Power movement , inspired in part by the civil rights movement in the United States. Protests and strikes became common, with events coming to head in April 1970 when police shot dead a protester named Basil Davis.

[ 71 ] Fearing a breakdown of law and order, Prime Minister Williams declared a state of emergency and ordered that many of the Black Power leaders be arrested. Some army leaders who were sympathetic to the Black Power movement, notably Raffique Shah and Rex Lassalle , attempted to mutiny; however, this was quashed by the Trinidad and Tobago Coast Guard .

[ 71 ] Williams and the PNM retained power, largely due to divisions in the opposition.

[ 71 ] Amidst the backdrop of the rising Black Power movement in 1960s Trinidad and Tobago, and following protests, strikes, and a mutiny attempt in April 1970, a more radical opposition emerged in the form of the National Union of Freedom Fighters (NUFF).  Dissatisfied with the perceived slow progress of change, and inspired by guerrilla warfare tactics, NUFF members launched attacks on banks, police stations, and other infrastructure, aiming to ignite a full-scale revolution against Prime Minister Eric Williams' government.  However, the group faced increasing pressure from police and security forces, leading to the deaths of many members and the eventual suppression of the insurgency by 1974.

[ 74 ] [ 75 ] In 1963 Tobago was struck by Hurricane Flora , which killed 30 people and resulted in enormous destruction across the island.

[ 76 ] Partly as a result of this, tourism came to replace agriculture as the island's primary source of income in the subsequent decades.

[ 76 ] On 1 May 1968, Trinidad and Tobago joined the Caribbean Free Trade Association (CARIFTA), which provided a continued economic, rather than political, linkage between the former British West Indies English-speaking countries after the West Indies Federation failed. On 1 August 1973, the country became a founding member state of CARIFTA's successor, the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), which is a political and economic union between several Caribbean countries and territories.

Between 1972 and 1983, the country profited greatly from the rising price of oil and the discovery of vast new oil deposits in its territorial waters, resulting in an economic boom that substantially increased living standards.

[ 10 ] [ 71 ] In 1976 the country became a republic within the Commonwealth , though it retained the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council as its final appellate court.

[ 10 ] The position of governor-general was replaced with that of President ; Ellis Clarke was the first to hold this largely ceremonial role.

[ 77 ] Tobago was granted limited self-rule with the creation of the Tobago House of Assembly in 1980.

[ 60 ] Port of Spain, the capital, in 2008 Williams died in 1981, being replaced by George Chambers who led the country until 1986. By this time a fall in the price of oil had resulted in a recession, causing rising inflation and unemployment.

[ 78 ] The main opposition parties united under the banner of National Alliance for Reconstruction (NAR) and won the 1986 Trinidad and Tobago general election , with NAR leader A. N. R. Robinson becoming the new Prime Minister.

[ 79 ] [ 71 ] Robinson was unable to hold together the fragile NAR coalition, and his economic reforms, such as the implementation of an International Monetary Fund Structural Adjustment Program and devaluation of currency led to social unrest.

[ 10 ] In 1990, 114 members of the Jamaat al Muslimeen , led by Yasin Abu Bakr (formerly known as Lennox Phillip) stormed the Red House (the seat of Parliament ), and Trinidad and Tobago Television , the only television station in the country at the time, holding Robinson and country's government hostage for six days before surrendering.

[ 80 ] The coup leaders were promised amnesty, but upon their surrender they were arrested, ultimately being released after protracted legal wrangling.

[ 52 ] Steelpan band at Carnival The PNM under Patrick Manning returned to power following the 1991 Trinidad and Tobago general election .

[ 10 ] Hoping to capitalise on an improvement in the economy, Manning called an early election in 1995, however, this resulted in a hung parliament . Two NAR representatives backed the opposition United National Congress (UNC), which had split off from the NAR in 1989, and they thus took power under Basdeo Panday , who became the country's first Indo-Trinidadian Prime Minister.

[ 10 ] [ 78 ] [ 81 ] After a period of political confusion caused by a series of inconclusive election results, Patrick Manning returned to power in 2001, retaining that position until 2010.

[ 10 ] In 2003 the country entered a second oil boom, and petroleum, petrochemicals and natural gas continue to be the backbone of the economy. Tourism and the public service are the mainstay of the economy of Tobago, though authorities have attempted to diversify the island's economy.

[ 82 ] A partnership resulted in Manning's defeat by the newly formed People's Partnership (PP) coalition in 2010, with Kamla Persad-Bissessar becoming the country's first female prime minister.

[ 83 ] [ 84 ] [ 85 ] Under the PP, a State of Emergency (SOE) was declared because of a spike in killings, and curfews were declared in so called "hotspots" around the country. The SOE lasted from August 21, 2011, to December 5, 2011.

[ 86 ] [ 87 ] However, the PP were defeated in 2015 by the PNM under Keith Rowley .

[ 88 ] [ 89 ] In August 2020, the governing People's National Movement won general election , earning the incumbent Prime Minister Keith Rowley a second term in office.

[ 90 ] During the second term of Dr.

Keith Rowley there were two declarations of states of emergency (SOE). The first, which came into effect on May 15, 2021, was to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic . It involved curfews and restrictions on activities and public events.

[ 91 ] The second SOE came into effect on December 30, 2024. The PM announced that it was to "address individuals who pose a threat to public safety, particularly those involved in criminal activities and the illegal use of firearms".

No curfews or restrictions on public events was announced. The SOE is expected to end in mid April 2025.

[ 92 ] [ 93 ] Another major event that happened during this period in Trinidad and Tobago was the seventh Commonwealth Youth Games. It was originally scheduled to happen 2021 but was delayed due to the pandemic. The games were successfully held from August 4–11, 2023, in Trinidad and Tobago.

[ 94 ] [ 95 ] It is first time a Caribbean country and Trinidad and Tobago hosted the games. On January 3, 2024, Prime Minister Keith Rowley announced his intention to leave office as Prime Minister before the 2025 Trinidad and Tobago general election . On February 26, 2025 Prime Minister Keith Rowley announced he will officially resign from office on March 16.

[ 96 ] On January 6, 2025, Prime Minister Keith Rowley made the announcement that Minister Stuart Young was elected by the Parliamentary Caucus of the People's National Movement as Prime Minister, succeeding Rowley.

[ 97 ] In April 2025,
the opposition, centrist United National Congress (UNC), won the election , meaning Kamla Persad-Bissessar became the next prime minister.

[ 98 ] Geography [ edit ] Main article: Geography of Trinidad and Tobago A map of Trinidad and Tobago Trinidad and Tobago is situated between 10° 2' and 11° 12' N latitude and 60° 30' and 61° 56' W longitude , with the Caribbean Sea to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the east and south, and the Gulf of Paria to the west. It is located in the far south-east of the Caribbean region, with the island of Trinidad being just 11 kilometres (6 nmi) off the coast of Venezuela in mainland South America across the Columbus Channel .

[ 10 ] The islands are a physiographic extension of South America .

[ 99 ] Covering an area of 5,128 km 2 (1,980 sq mi), [ 100 ] the country consists of two main islands, Trinidad and Tobago , separated by a 37-kilometre (20-nautical-mile) strait, plus a number of much smaller islands , including Chacachacare , Monos , Huevos , Gaspar Grande (or Gasparee), Little Tobago , and Saint Giles Island .

[ 10 ] Trinidad and Tobago's topography Trinidad and Tobago from space Trinidad is 4,768 km 2 (1,841 sq mi) in area (comprising 93.0% of the country's total area) with an average length of 80 kilometres (50 mi) and an average width of 59 kilometres (37 mi). Tobago has an area of about 300 km 2 (120 sq mi), or 5.8% of the country's area, is 41 km ( 25 + 1 ⁄ 2 mi) long and 12 km ( 7 + 1 ⁄ 2 mi) at its greatest width. Trinidad and Tobago lie on the continental shelf of South America, and are thus geologically considered to lie entirely in South America.

[ 10 ] The terrain of the islands is a mixture of mountains and plains.

[ 15 ] On Trinidad the Northern Range runs parallel with the north coast, and contains the country's highest peak ( El Cerro del Aripo ), which is 940 metres (3,080 ft) above sea level, [ 15 ] and second highest ( El Tucuche , 936 metres (3,071 ft)).

[ 10 ] The rest of the island is generally flatter, excluding the Central Range and Montserrat Hills in the centre of the island and the Southern Range and Trinity Hills in the south. The three mountain ranges determine the drainage pattern of Trinidad.

[ 99 ] The east coast is noted for its beaches, most notably Manzanilla Beach . The island contains several large swamp areas, such as the Caroni Swamp and the Nariva Swamp .

[ 10 ] Major bodies of water on Trinidad include the Hollis Reservoir , Navet Reservoir , Caroni Reservoir . Trinidad is made up of a variety of soil types, the majority being fine sands and heavy clays. The alluvial valleys of the Northern Range and the soils of the East–West Corridor are the most fertile.

[ 101 ] [ citation needed ] Trinidad is also notable for containing Pitch Lake , the largest natural reservoir of asphalt in the world.

[ 15 ] [ 10 ] Tobago contains a flat plain in its south-west, with the eastern half of the island being more mountainous, culminating in Pigeon Peak, the island's highest point at 550 metres (1,800 ft).

[ 102 ] Tobago also contains several coral reefs off its coast.

[ 10 ] The majority of the population reside on the island of Trinidad, and this is thus the location of largest towns and cities . There are four major municipalities in Trinidad: the capital Port of Spain, San Fernando , Arima and Chaguanas . The main town on Tobago is Scarborough .

Geology [ edit ] Main article: Trinidad § Geology Pitch Lake, in south-west Trinidad The Northern Range consists mainly of Upper Jurassic and Cretaceous metamorphic rocks . The Northern Lowlands (the East–West Corridor and Caroni Plain ) consist of younger shallow marine clastic sediments . South of this, the Central Range fold and thrust belt consists of Cretaceous and Eocene sedimentary rocks , with Miocene formations along the southern and eastern flanks. The Naparima Plain and the Nariva Swamp form the southern shoulder of this uplift.

[ citation needed ] The Southern Lowlands consist of Miocene and Pliocene sands, clays, and gravels. These overlie oil and natural gas deposits, especially north of the Los Bajos Fault. The Southern Range forms the third anticlinal uplift. The rocks consist of sandstones , shales , siltstones and clays formed in the Miocene and uplifted in the Pleistocene .

Oil sands and mud volcanoes are especially common in this area.

[ citation needed ] One of the natural wonders of the island is Pitch Lake , a natural pitch lake on the island of Trinidad which is the largest naturally occurring deposit of asphalt on Earth.

Climate [ edit ] Hurricane Beryl passes over Trinidad and Tobago in July 2024 Trinidad and Tobago has a maritime tropical climate .

[ 15 ] [ 10 ] There are two seasons annually: the dry season for the first five months of the year, and the rainy season in the remaining seven of the year. Winds are predominantly from the northeast and are dominated by the northeast trade winds . Unlike many Caribbean islands Trinidad and Tobago lies outside the main hurricane alleys; nevertheless, the island of Tobago was struck by Hurricane Flora on 30 September 1963. In the Northern Range of Trinidad, the climate is often cooler than that of the sweltering heat of the plains below, due to constant cloud and mist cover, and heavy rains in the mountains.

Record temperatures for Trinidad and Tobago are 39 °C (102 °F) [ 103 ] for the high in Port of Spain, and a low of 12 °C (54 °F).

[ 104 ] Biodiversity [ edit ] Further information: Environment of Trinidad and Tobago and Biota of Trinidad and Tobago Mayaro Beach, in the southeastern area of Trinidad Trinidad Motmots Channel-billed toucan, Trinidad Because the islands of Trinidad and Tobago lie on the continental shelf of South America, and in ancient times were physically connected to the South American mainland, their biological diversity is unlike that of most other Caribbean islands, and has much more in common with that of Venezuela.

[ 105 ] The main ecosystems are: coastal and marine (coral reefs, mangrove swamps, open ocean and seagrass beds); forest; freshwater (rivers and streams); karst ; man-made ecosystems (agricultural land, freshwater dams, secondary forest); and savanna. On 1 August 1996, Trinidad and Tobago ratified the 1992 Rio Convention on Biological Diversity , and it has produced a biodiversity action plan and four reports describing the country's contribution to biodiversity conservation. These reports formally acknowledged the importance of biodiversity to the well-being of the country's people through provision of ecosystem services .

[ 106 ] Trinidad and Tobago is a major nesting site for Leatherback Turtles Information about vertebrates is rather comprehensive, with 472 bird species (2 endemics), about 100 mammals, about 90 reptiles (a few endemics), about 30 amphibians (including several endemics), 50 freshwater fish and at least 950 marine fish.

[ 107 ] Notable mammal species include the ocelot , West Indian manatee , collared peccary (known as the quenk locally), red-rumped agouti , lappe , red brocket deer , Neotropical otter , weeper capuchin and red howler monkey ; there are also some 70 species of bat , including the vampire bat and fringe-lipped bat .

[ 10 ] [ 108 ] The larger reptiles present include 5 species of marine turtles known to nest on the islands' beaches, the green anaconda , the Boa constrictor and the spectacled caiman . There are at least 47 species of snakes, including only four dangerous venomous species (only in Trinidad and not in Tobago), lizards such as the green iguana , the Tupinambis cryptus and a few species of fresh water turtles and land tortoises.

[ 10 ] [ 109 ] are present. Of the amphibians, the golden tree frog and Trinidad poison frog are found in the highest peaks of Trinidad's Northern Range and nearby on Venezuela 's Paria Peninsula.

[ 109 ] [ 110 ] Marine life is abundant, with several species of sea urchin , coral , lobster , sea anemone , starfish , manta ray , dolphin , porpoise and whale shark present in the islands' waters.

[ 111 ] The introduced Pterois is viewed as a pest, as it eats many native species of fish and has no natural predators; efforts are currently underway to cull the numbers of this species.

[ 111 ] The country contains five terrestrial ecoregions: Trinidad and Tobago moist forests , Lesser Antillean dry forests , Trinidad and Tobago dry forests , Windward Islands xeric scrub , and Trinidad mangroves .

[ 112 ] Trinidad and Tobago is noted particularly for its large number of bird species, and is a popular destination for bird watchers . Notable species include the scarlet ibis , cocrico , egret , shiny cowbird , bananaquit , oilbird and various species of honeycreeper , trogon , toucan , parrot , tanager , woodpecker , antbird , kites , hawks , boobies , pelicans and vultures ; there are also 17 species of hummingbird, including the tufted coquette which is the world's third smallest.

[ 113 ] Information about invertebrates is dispersed and very incomplete. About 650 butterflies, [ 107 ] at least 672 beetles (from Tobago alone) [ 114 ] and 40 corals [ 107 ] have been recorded.

[ 107 ] Other notable invertebrates include the cockroach , leaf-cutter ant and numerous species of mosquitoes , termites , spiders and tarantulas .

Although the list is far from complete, 1,647 species of fungi, including lichens, have been recorded.

[ 115 ] [ 116 ] [ 117 ] The true total number of fungi is likely to be far higher, given the generally accepted estimate that only about 7% of all fungi worldwide have so far been discovered.

[ 118 ] A first effort to estimate the number of endemic fungi tentatively listed 407 species.

[ 119 ] Information about micro-organisms is dispersed and very incomplete. Nearly 200 species of marine algae have been recorded.

[ 107 ] The true total number of micro-organism species must be much higher.

Thanks to a recently published checklist, plant diversity in Trinidad and Tobago is well documented with about 3,300 species (59 endemic) recorded.

[ 107 ] Despite significant felling, forests still cover about 40% of the country, and there are about 350 different species of tree.

[ 105 ] A notable tree is the manchineel which is extremely poisonous to humans, and even just touching its sap can cause severe blistering of the skin; the tree is often covered with warning signs. The country had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 6.62/10, ranking it 69th globally out of 172 countries.

[ 120 ] Threats to the country's biodiversity include over-hunting and poaching (see Hunting#Trinidad and Tobago ), habitat loss and fragmentation (particularly due to forest fires and land clearance for quarrying, agriculture, squatting, housing and industrial development and road construction), water pollution, and introduction of invasive species and pathogens.

Government and politics [ edit ] Main article: Politics of Trinidad and Tobago Christine Kangaloo President since 20 March 2023 Kamla Persad-Bissessar Prime Minister since 1st May 2025 Trinidad and Tobago is a republic with a two-party system and a bicameral parliamentary system based on the Westminster System .

[ 15 ] The head of state of Trinidad and Tobago is the president, a largely ceremonial role currently held by Christine Kangaloo .

[ 15 ] This position replaced that of the governor-general—who had represented the monarch of Trinidad and Tobago —when the country became a republic in 1976.

[ 10 ] The head of government is the prime minister , currently Kamla Persad-Bissessar since May, 2025. On January 3, 2025, then-Prime Minister Keith Rowley announced his intention to demit office before the 2025 Trinidad and Tobago general election . He later confirmed on February 26 that he would officially resign on March 16.

[ 96 ] On January 6, 2025, Stuart Young was elected Prime Minister-designate by the Parliamentary Caucus of the People's National Movement to succeed Rowley.

[ 97 ] He officially assumed office on March 17, 2025. Young’s party, the People’s National Movement (PNM) subsequently lost elections with Young losing the prime ministership.

The president is elected by an Electoral college composed of all members of both houses of the Parliament .

Following a general election, which takes place every five years, the president appoints as prime minister the person who has the support of a majority in the House of Representatives ; this has generally been the leader of the party which won the most seats in the election (except in the case of the 2001 General Elections ).

[ 10 ] Since 1980 Tobago has also had its own elections, separate from the general elections. In these elections, members are elected and serve in the unicameral Tobago House of Assembly.

[ 15 ] [ 10 ] [ 121 ] Parliament consists of the Senate (31 seats) and the House of Representatives (41 seats, plus the Speaker).

[ 15 ] [ 122 ] The members of the Senate are appointed by the president; 16 government senators are appointed on the advice of the prime minister, six opposition senators are appointed on the advice of the leader of the opposition , currently Kamla Persad-Bissessar , and nine independent senators are appointed by the president to represent other sectors of civil society. The 41 members of the House of Representatives are elected by the people for a maximum term of five years in a " first past the post " system.

Administrative divisions [ edit ] Main article: Regions and municipalities of Trinidad and Tobago Regional corporations and municipalities of Trinidad and Tobago Trinidad is split into 14 regions and municipalities , consisting of nine regions and five municipalities, which have a limited level of autonomy.

[ 15 ] [ 10 ] The various councils are made up of a mixture of elected and appointed members. Elections are held every three years.

[ citation needed ] Tobago is administered by the Tobago House of Assembly . The country was formerly divided into counties .

Political culture [ edit ] The two main national parties are the People's National Movement (PNM) and the United National Congress (UNC). They both are left of centre parties and support for these parties appears to fall along ethnic lines rather than ideology, with the PNM consistently obtaining a majority of Afro-Trinidadian vote, and the UNC gaining a majority of Indo-Trinidadian support. Several smaller parties also exist. As of the August 2020 General Elections, there were 19 registered political parties. These include, the Progressive Empowerment Party, Trinidad Humanity Campaign, New National Vision, Movement for Social Justice, Congress of the People, Movement for National Development, Progressive Democratic Patriots , National Coalition for Transformation, Progressive Party, Independent Liberal Party, Democratic Party of Trinidad and Tobago, National Organisation of We the People, Unrepresented Peoples Party, Trinidad and Tobago Democratic Front, The National Party, One Tobago Voice, and Unity of the Peoples.

It also is active in the Summit of the Americas process and supports the establishment of the Free Trade Area of the Americas , lobbying other nations for seating the Secretariat in Port of Spain.

[ citation needed ] As a member of CARICOM, Trinidad and Tobago strongly backed efforts by the United States to bring political stability to Haiti , contributing personnel to the Multinational Force in 1994. After its 1962 independence from the United Kingdom, Trinidad and Tobago joined the United Nations and Commonwealth of Nations . In 1967 it became the first Commonwealth country to join the Organization of American States (OAS).

[ 156 ] Demographics [ edit ] Main article: Demographics of Trinidad and Tobago The population of the country estimated at between 1.4 to 1.5 million by the mid 2020s.

[ 157 ] [ 158 ] Ethnic groups [ edit ] Main article: Demographics of Trinidad and Tobago § Ethnic groups Ethnic groups of Trinidad and Tobago [ 159 ] Ethnic groups percent Indian 35.4% African 34.2% Mixed 30.1% Unspecified 6.2% Other 1.3% The ethnic composition of Trinidad and Tobago reflects a history of conquest and immigration.

[ 160 ] While the earliest inhabitants were of indigenous heritage, the two dominant groups in the country are now those of Indian-South Asian heritage and those of sub-Saharan African heritage.

Indo-Trinidadian and Tobagonians make up the country's largest ethnic group (approximately 35.4%); [ 15 ] they are primarily the descendants of indentured workers from India , [ 161 ] brought to replace freed (formerly enslaved) Afro-Trinidadians who refused to continue working on the sugar plantations. Through cultural preservation many residents of Indian descent continue to maintain traditions from their ancestral homeland. Indo-Trinidadians reside primarily on Trinidad; as of the 2011 census only 2.5% of Tobago's population was of Indian descent.

[ 162 ] Afro-Trinidadians make up the country's second largest ethnic group, with approximately 34.2% of the population identifying as being of African descent.

[ 15 ] The majority of people of an African background are the descendants of enslaved West Africans forcibly transported to the islands from as early as the 16th century. This group constitute the majority on Tobago, at 85.2%.

[ 162 ] The bulk of the rest of the population are those who identify as being of mixed heritage which equates to 30% of the population.

[ 15 ] There are also small but significant minorities of people of Indigenous , European , Portuguese , Latin American , Chinese , and Arab descent.

Arima in Trinidad is a noted centre of First Peoples' culture, including as the headquarters of the Carib Queen and the location of the Santa Rosa First Peoples Community .

[ 10 ] There is a Cocoa Panyol community in Trinidad and Tobago whose ancestors were migrant labourers of mixed Spanish, indigenous, and African descent who came from Venezuela between the late 19th and early 20th century to work on the cocoa estates.

[ 163 ] Languages [ edit ] Main article: Demographics of Trinidad and Tobago § Language English is the official language. Additional languages on the islands are Trinidadian English Creole , Tobagonian English Creole , Trinidadian Hindustani , Antillean French Creole (Patois) , Spanish , and Chinese .

[ 157 ] Trinidad and Tobago Creoles [ edit ] Further information: Trinidadian and Tobagonian English , Trinidadian Creole , and Tobagonian Creole The vast majority of people in Trinidad and Tobago speak English , the country's official language. However, the most commonly spoken language of the country is Trinidadian and Tobagonian Creole, which stem from languages that reflects the nation's multicultural influences and colonial history.

[ 164 ] These two widely spoken creoles incorporate vocabulary and grammar structures that derive from African, Indian, European, and Indigenous influence.

[ 165 ] [ 166 ] Languages such as Spanish and Trinidadian Hindustani are also spoken by smaller communities in Trinidad. Trinidadian Hindustani was brought by Indian indentured laborers who arrived in the mid-19th century. Over time, however, both Spanish and Trinidadian Hindustani have declined in everyday use and are now largely preserved through cultural, religious, and familial traditions.

[ 58 ] A majority of the early Indian indentured immigrants spoke the Bhojpuri and Awadhi dialects, which later formed into Trinidadian Hindustani. In 1935, Indian movies began showing to audiences in Trinidad. Most of the Indian movies were in the Standard Hindustani (Hindi-Urdu) dialect and this modified Trinidadian Hindustani slightly by adding Standard Hindi and Urdu phrases and vocabulary to Trinidadian Hindustani. Indian movies also revitalized Hindustani among Indo-Trinidadian and Tobagonians.

[ 169 ] The British colonial government and estate owners had disdain and contempt for Hindustani and Indian languages in Trinidad. Due to this, many Indians saw it as a broken language keeping them in poverty and bound to the cane fields, and did not pass it on as a first language , but rather as a heritage language , as they favored English as a way out.

[ 170 ] Around the mid to late 1960s the lingua franca of Indo-Trinidadian and Tobagonians switched from Trinidadian Hindustani to a sort of Hindinized version of English. Today Hindustani survives on through Indo-Trinidadian and Tobagonian musical forms such as, Bhajan , Indian classical music, Indian folk music, Filmi , Pichakaree , Chutney , Chutney soca , and Chutney parang . As of 2003, there are about 15,633 Indo-Trinidadian and Tobagonians who speak Trinidadian Hindustani and as of 2011, there are about 10,000 who speak Standard Hindi. Many Indo-Trinidadians and Tobagonians today speak a type of Hinglish that consists of Trinidadian and Tobagonian English that is heavily laced with Trinidadian Hindustani vocabulary and phrases and many Indo-Trinidadians and Tobagonians can recite phrases or prayers in Hindustani today. There are many places in Trinidad and Tobago that have names of Hindustani origin. Some phrases and vocabulary have even made their way into the mainstream English and English Creole dialect of the country.

[ 171 ] [ 172 ] [ 173 ] [ 174 ] [ 58 ] [ 175 ] World Hindi Day is celebrated each year on 10 January with events organized by the National Council of Indian Culture, Hindi Nidhi Foundation, Indian High Commission, Mahatma Gandhi Institute for Cultural Co-operation, and the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha .

[ 176 ] Spanish [ edit ] Further information: Spanish language in Trinidad and Tobago and Trinidadian Spanish Spanish can be found in many place names, shown here the city of San Fernando In 2014, Spanish was the native language of around 4,000 people (or 0.3% of the total population) living in Trinidad and Tobago. The number has grown substantially referred to the massive immigration of Venezuelans due to the ongoing crisis in that country.

[ citation needed ] [ 177 ] Tamil [ edit ] Further information: Tamil language and Tamil diaspora § Trinidad and Tobago The Tamil language is spoken by some of the older Tamil (Madrasi) Indo-Trinidadian and Tobagonian population. It is mostly spoken by the few remaining children of indentured Indian labourers from the present-day state of Tamil Nadu in India . Other speakers of the language are recent immigrants from Tamil Nadu.

[ 178 ] Chinese [ edit ] Further information: Chinese language A majority of the people who immigrated in the 19th century were from southern China and spoke the Hakka and Yue dialects of Chinese. In the 20th century after the years of indentureship up to the present-day more Chinese people have immigrated to Trinidad and Tobago for business and they speak the dialects of the indenturees along with other Chinese dialects, such as Mandarin and Min .

[ 179 ] [ 180 ] J. Dyer Ball, writing in 1906, says: "In Trinidad there were, about twenty years ago, 4,000 or 5,000 Chinese, but they have decreased to probably about 2,000 or 3,000, [2,200 in 1900]. They used to work in sugar plantations, but are now principally shopkeepers, as well as general merchants, miners and railway builders,
etc." [ 181 ] Indigenous languages [ edit ] The indigenous languages were Yao on Trinidad and Karina on Tobago, both Cariban, and Shebaya on Trinidad, which was Arawakan.

They are, however, expected to have basic reading and writing skills when they commence primary school. Students begin primary school at age five and move on to secondary after seven years. The seven classes of primary school consists of First Year and Second Year, followed by Standard One through Standard Five. During the final year of primary school, students prepare for and sit the Secondary Entrance Assessment (SEA) which determines the secondary school the child will attend.

[ 194 ] Economy [ edit ] Main article: Economy of Trinidad and Tobago This section needs to be updated .

Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information.

( May 2025 ) Piarco International Airport Trinidad and Tobago is the most developed nation and one of the wealthiest in the Caribbean and is listed in the top 40 (2010 information) of the 70 high-income countries in the world.

[ citation needed ] Its gross national income per capita of US$20,070 [ 195 ] (2014 gross national income at Atlas Method) is one of the highest in the Caribbean.

[ 196 ] In November 2011, the OECD removed Trinidad and Tobago from its list of developing countries .

[ 197 ] Trinidad's economy is strongly influenced by the petroleum industry. Tourism and manufacturing are also important to the local economy. Tourism is a growing sector, particularly on Tobago, although proportionately it is much less important than in many other Caribbean islands. Agricultural products include citrus and cocoa. It also supplies manufactured goods, notably food, beverages, and cement, to the Caribbean region.

Oil and gas [ edit ] The oil refinery at Pointe-à-Pierre . A strong petrochemical and oil industry has boosted the economy and the country is less reliant on tourism or agriculture Trinidad and Tobago is the leading Caribbean producer of oil and gas, and its economy is heavily dependent upon these resources.

[ 10 ] Oil and gas account for about 40% of GDP and 80% of exports, but only 5% of employment.

[ 15 ] Recent growth has been fuelled by investments in liquefied natural gas (LNG), petrochemicals, and steel. Additional petrochemical, aluminium, and plastics projects are in various stages of planning.

The country is also a regional financial centre, and the economy has a growing trade surplus.

[ 100 ] The expansion of Atlantic LNG over the past six years created the largest single-sustained phase of economic growth in Trinidad and Tobago. The nation is an exporter of LNG and supplied a total of 13.4 billion m 3 in 2017. The largest markets for Trinidad and Tobago's LNG exports are Chile and the United States.

[ 198 ] Trinidad and Tobago has transitioned from an oil-based economy to a natural gas based economy. In 2017, natural gas production totalled 18.5 billion m 3 , a decrease of 0.4% from 2016 with 18.6 billion m 3 of production.

[ 198 ] Oil production has decreased over the past decade from 7.1 million metric tonnes per year in 2007 to 4.4 million metric tonnes per year in 2017.

[ 199 ] In December 2005, the Atlantic LNG's fourth production module or "train" for liquefied natural gas (LNG) began production. Train four has increased Atlantic LNG's overall output capacity by almost 50% and is the largest LNG train in the world at 5.2 million tons/year of LNG.

[ citation needed ] Tourism [ edit ] Tourists at Pigeon Point beach, Tobago Trinidad and Tobago is far less dependent on tourism than many other Caribbean countries and territories, with the bulk of tourist activity occurring on Tobago.

[ 10 ] The government has made efforts to boost this sector in recent years.

[ 10 ] Some of the attractions of the island are its street food culture and cultural events, and Aripita Avenue in Port of Spain is one noted place for this.

[ 200 ] Maracas falls, is over 90 meter falls the tallest in the country (see Maracas Valley ) Agriculture [ edit ] Historically agricultural production including sugar and coffee dominated the economy, with sugar cane earning the most money, and providing the most employment. Some of the sugar produced was eaten in Trinidad but most of it was sold to United Kingdom , Canada , and United States . Cocoa was the second most valuable crop, and covers more area than sugar cane. Sugar production ceased around 2010 or so due to deflated prices of the time and high production costs.

Most farmers grow cocoa to sell to other countries that cannot grow it themselves. Trinidad was once the second biggest producer of cocoa after Ecuador , but this would not last long. As countries in West Africa and South America began growing cocoa at a lower price, Trinidad lost many of its customers.

[ 201 ] Agriculture has been in steep decline since the 20th century and now forms just 0.4% of the country's GDP and employs 3.1% of the workforce.

[ 15 ] [ 10 ] Various fruits and vegetables are grown, such as cucumbers, eggplant, cassava, pumpkin, dasheen (taro) and coconut, and fishing is still also commonly practised.

[ 15 ] Economic diversification [ edit ] Trinidad and Tobago, in an effort to undergo economic transformation through diversification, [ 15 ] formed InvesTT in 2012 to serve as the country's sole investment promotion agency. This agency is aligned to the Ministry of Trade and Industry and is to be the key agent in growing the country's non-oil and gas sectors significantly and sustainably.

[ 202 ] Food and beverage industry [ edit ] Many restaurants serve Trinidad and Tobago dishes such as Roti or doubles. Fresh cut coconut water and jelly is another popular item Trinidad and Tobago is home to the largest brewery company in CARICOM , the Carib Brewery . It also has a number of food production facilities including a Nestle plant. Because the island has less land and a higher income than average there is a tendency to import food, nevertheless there is local production of many products including milk, chocolate, coconuts, and alcoholic beverages among others.

[ 203 ] In 2022, the output of the Food, Beverage, and Tobacco industry was almost 8 billion Trinidian dollars.

[ 204 ] An example of a restaurant chain in Trinidad and Tobago is Royal Castle .

[ 205 ] See also Category:Food and drink companies of Trinidad and Tobago Communications infrastructure [ edit ] Trinidad and Tobago has a well developed communications sector. The telecommunications and broadcasting sectors generated an estimated TT$5.63 billion (US$0.88 billion) in 2014, which as a percentage of GDP equates to 3.1 percent. This represented a 1.9 percent increase in total revenues generated by this industry compared to last year. Of total telecommunications and broadcasting revenues, mobile voice services accounted for the majority of revenues with TT$2.20 billion (39.2 percent). This was followed by internet services which contributed TT$1.18 billion or 21.1 percent. The next highest revenue earners for the industry were fixed voice services and paid television services whose contributions totalled TT$0.76 billion and TT$0.70 billion respectively (13.4 percent and 12.4 percent). International voice services was next in line, generating TT$0.27 billion (4.7 percent) in revenues. Free-to Air radio and television services contributed TT$0.18 billion and TT$0.13 billion respectively (3.2 percent and 2.4 percent). Finally, other contributors included "other revenues" and "leased line services" with earnings of TT$0.16 billion and TT$0.05 billion respectively, with 2.8 percent and 0.9 percent.

[ 206 ] There are several providers for each segment of the telecommunications market. Fixed Lines Telephone service is provided by Digicel , TSTT (operating as bmobile ) and Cable & Wireless Communications operating as FLOW ; cellular service is provided by TSTT (operating as bmobile) and Digicel whilst internet service is provided by TSTT , FLOW , Digicel , Green Dot and Lisa Communications.

Creative industries [ edit ] The Government of Trinidad and Tobago has recognised the creative industries as a pathway to economic growth and development. It is one of the newest, most dynamic sectors where creativity, knowledge and intangibles serve as the basic productive resource. In 2015, the Trinidad and Tobago Creative Industries Company Limited (CreativeTT) was established as a state agency under the Ministry of Trade and Industry with a mandate to stimulate and facilitate the business development and export activities of the Creative Industries in Trinidad and Tobago to generate national wealth, and, as such, the company is responsible for the strategic and business development of the three niche areas and sub sectors currently under its purview – Music , Film and Fashion.

MusicTT , FilmTT and FashionTT are the subsidiaries established to fulfil this mandate.

Transport [ edit ] Main article: Transport in Trinidad and Tobago An intersection of Churchill–Roosevelt Highway and Uriah Butler Highway , 2009 Traffic drives on the left side of road The transport system in Trinidad and Tobago consists of a dense network of highways and roads across both major islands, ferries connecting Port of Spain with Scarborough and San Fernando , and international airports on both islands.

[ 10 ] The Uriah Butler Highway , Churchill Roosevelt Highway and the Sir Solomon Hochoy Highway links the island of Trinidad together, whereas the Claude Noel Highway is the only major highway in Tobago. Public transportation options on land are public buses, private taxis and minibuses. By sea, the options are inter-island ferries and inter-city water taxis.

[ 207 ] The island of Trinidad is served by Piarco International Airport located in Piarco , which opened on 8 January 1931.

[ 208 ] Sitting at an elevation of 17.4 metres (57 ft) above sea level , it comprises an area of 680 hectares (1,700 acres) and has a runway of 3,200 metres (10,500 ft). The airport consists of two terminals, the North Terminal and the South Terminal. The older South Terminal underwent renovations in 2009 for use as a VIP entrance point during the fifth Summit of the Americas. The North Terminal was completed in 2001, and consists of [ 209 ] 14-second-level aircraft gates with jetways for international flights, two ground-level domestic gates and 82 ticket counter positions. Piarco International Airport was named the Best Airport in the Caribbean in 2023 by international air transport rating organisation Skytrax. According to the Trinidad Guardian "This is the third consecutive year that Piarco has copped this award." [ 210 ] The state-owned Caribbean Airlines is the largest in the region.

In 2008, the passenger throughput at Piarco International Airport was approximately 2.6 million. It is the seventh busiest airport in the Caribbean and the third busiest in the English-speaking Caribbean, after Sangster International Airport and Lynden Pindling International Airport .

[ citation needed ] Caribbean Airlines, the national airline, operates its main hub at the Piarco International Airport and services the Caribbean, the United States, Canada and South America. The airline is wholly owned by the Government of Trinidad and Tobago. After an additional cash injection of US$50 million, the Trinidad and Tobago government acquired the Jamaican airline Air Jamaica on 1 May 2010, with a 6–12-month transition period to follow.

[ 211 ] The Island of Tobago is served by the A.N.R. Robinson International Airport in Crown Point .

[ 10 ] This airport has regular services to North America and Europe. There are regular flights between the two islands, with fares being heavily subsidised by the Government.

Trinidad was formerly home to a railway network , however this was closed down in 1968.

[ 212 ] There have been talks to build a new railway on the islands, though nothing yet has come of this.

[ 213 ] Energy policy and climate change [ edit ] Trinidad and Tobago is the region's leading exporter of oil and gas but imports of fossil fuels provided over 90% of the energy consumed by its CARICOM neighbours in 2008. This vulnerability led CARICOM to develop an Energy Policy which was approved in 2013. This policy is accompanied by the CARICOM Sustainable Energy Roadmap and Strategy (C-SERMS). Under the policy, renewable energy sources are to contribute 20% of the total electricity generation mix in member states by 2017, 28% by 2022 and 47% by 2027.

[ 214 ] In 2014 Trinidad and Tobago was the third country in the world which emitted the most CO 2 per capita after Qatar and Curacao according to the World Bank.

[ 215 ] On average, each inhabitant produced 34.2 metric tons of CO 2 in the atmosphere. In comparison, the world average was 5.0 tons per capita the same year. Over recent years CO 2 emissions have declined, so that in 2021 at 21.01 tonnes per capita, [ 216 ] Trinidad and Tobago ranked fourth, after the tiny countries smaller than half a million, such as Curacao , are excluded, and is the only non-Middle East country in the remaining worst seven CO 2 emitters on a per capita basis .

[ 217 ] Activity sectoral profile of worst 20 CO 2 intensity emitters . (Data available from [ 216 ] ) In terms of emissions intensity of economy (defined as CO 2 emissions per unit of GDP ), Trinidad and Tobago ranked third globally.

[ 216 ] Its emissions-source profile is unique amongst the worst CO 2 intensity emitters as the so-called "other sectors", which includes: industrial process emissions, agricultural soils and waste, accounts for more than fifty per cent of fossil CO 2 emissions, rather than the power industry, other industrial combustion, transport and buildings sectors.

[ 217 ] The Caribbean Industrial Research Institute in Trinidad and Tobago facilitates climate change research and provides industrial support for R&D related to food security. It also carries out equipment testing and calibration for major industries.

[ 214 ] Culture [ edit ] Main article: Culture of Trinidad and Tobago Trinidad and Tobago has a diverse culture with African, Indian, Creole, European, Chinese, Indigenous, Latin American, and Arab influences, reflecting the various communities who have migrated to the islands over the centuries.
