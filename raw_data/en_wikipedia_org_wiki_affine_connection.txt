An affine connection on the sphere rolls the affine tangent plane from one point to another. As it does so, the point of contact traces out a curve in the plane: the [development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_(differential_geometry) "Development (differential geometry)").

In [differential geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry "Differential geometry"), an **affine connection**[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_connection#cite_note-3) is a geometric object on a [smooth manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_manifold "Smooth manifold") which _connects_ nearby [tangent spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_space "Tangent space"), so it permits [tangent vector fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_field "Vector field") to be [differentiated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative "Derivative") as if they were functions on the manifold with values in a fixed [vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space"). Connections are among the simplest methods of defining differentiation of the [sections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_(fiber_bundle) "Section (fiber bundle)") of [vector bundles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_bundle "Vector bundle").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_connection#cite_note-FOOTNOTELee201888Connections-4)

The notion of an affine connection has its roots in 19th-century geometry and [tensor calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_calculus "Tensor calculus"), but was not fully developed until the early 1920s, by [Élie Cartan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89lie_Cartan "Élie Cartan") (as part of his general theory of [connections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartan_connection "Cartan connection")) and [Hermann Weyl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Weyl "Hermann Weyl") (who used the notion as a part of his foundations for [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity")). The terminology is due to Cartan[[b]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_connection#cite_note-6) and has its origins in the identification of tangent spaces in [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space")**R**_n_ by translation: the idea is that a choice of affine connection makes a manifold look infinitesimally like Euclidean space not just smoothly, but as an [affine space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_space "Affine space").

On any manifold of positive dimension there are infinitely many affine connections. If the manifold is further endowed with a [metric tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_tensor "Metric tensor") then there is a natural choice of affine connection, called the [Levi-Civita connection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levi-Civita_connection "Levi-Civita connection"). The choice of an affine connection is equivalent to prescribing a way of differentiating vector fields which satisfies several reasonable properties ([linearity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linearity "Linearity") and the [Leibniz rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_rule "Product rule")). This yields a possible definition of an affine connection as a [covariant derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariant_derivative "Covariant derivative") or (linear) [connection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection_(vector_bundle) "Connection (vector bundle)") on the [tangent bundle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_bundle "Tangent bundle"). A choice of affine connection is also equivalent to a notion of [parallel transport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_transport "Parallel transport"), which is a method for transporting tangent vectors along curves. This also defines a parallel transport on the [frame bundle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_bundle "Frame bundle"). Infinitesimal parallel transport in the frame bundle yields another description of an affine connection, either as a [Cartan connection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartan_connection "Cartan connection") for the [affine group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_group "Affine group") or as a [principal connection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection_(principal_bundle) "Connection (principal bundle)") on the frame bundle.

The main invariants of an affine connection are its [torsion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torsion_tensor "Torsion tensor") and its [curvature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvature "Curvature"). The torsion measures how closely the [Lie bracket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_derivative "Lie derivative") of vector fields can be recovered from the affine connection. Affine connections may also be used to define (affine) [geodesics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesics "Geodesics") on a manifold, generalizing the _straight lines_ of Euclidean space, although the geometry of those straight lines can be very different from usual [Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry "Euclidean geometry"); the main differences are encapsulated in the curvature of the connection.

Motivation and history
----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Affine_connection&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Motivation and history")]

A [smooth manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_manifold "Smooth manifold") is a [mathematical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical "Mathematical") object which looks locally like a smooth deformation of Euclidean space **R**_n_: for example a smooth curve or surface looks locally like a smooth deformation of a line or a plane. [Smooth functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_function "Smooth function") and [vector fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_field "Vector field") can be defined on manifolds, just as they can on Euclidean space, and [scalar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_(mathematics) "Scalar (mathematics)") functions on manifolds can be differentiated in a natural way. However, differentiation of vector fields is less straightforward: this is a simple matter in Euclidean space, because the tangent space of based vectors at a point p can be identified naturally (by translation) with the tangent space at a nearby point q. On a general manifold, there is no such natural identification between nearby tangent spaces, and so tangent vectors at nearby points cannot be compared in a well-defined way. The notion of an affine connection was introduced to remedy this problem by _connecting_ nearby tangent spaces. The origins of this idea can be traced back to two main sources: [surface theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry_of_surfaces "Differential geometry of surfaces") and [tensor calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_calculus "Tensor calculus").

### Motivation from surface theory

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Affine_connection&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Motivation from surface theory")]

Consider a smooth surface S in a 3-dimensional Euclidean space. Near any point, S can be approximated by its [tangent plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_plane "Tangent plane") at that point, which is an [affine subspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_subspace "Affine subspace") of Euclidean space. Differential geometers in the 19th century were interested in the notion of [development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_(differential_geometry) "Development (differential geometry)") in which one surface was _rolled_ along another, without _slipping_ or _twisting_. In particular, the tangent plane to a point of S can be rolled on S: this should be easy to imagine when S is a surface like the 2-sphere, which is the smooth boundary of a [convex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_set "Convex set") region. As the tangent plane is rolled on S, the point of contact traces out a curve on S. Conversely, given a curve on S, the tangent plane can be rolled along that curve. This provides a way to identify the tangent planes at different points along the curve: in particular, a tangent vector in the tangent space at one point on the curve is identified with a unique tangent vector at any other point on the curve. These identifications are always given by [affine transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_transformation "Affine transformation") from one tangent plane to another.

This notion of parallel transport of tangent vectors, by affine transformations, along a curve has a characteristic feature: the point of contact of the tangent plane with the surface _always moves_ with the curve under parallel translation (i.e., as the tangent plane is rolled along the surface, the point of contact moves). This generic condition is characteristic of [Cartan connections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartan_connection "Cartan connection"). In more modern approaches, the point of contact is viewed as the _origin_ in the tangent plane (which is then a vector space), and the movement of the origin is corrected by a translation, so that parallel transport is linear, rather than affine.

In the point of view of Cartan connections, however, the affine subspaces of Euclidean space are _model_ surfaces — they are the simplest surfaces in Euclidean 3-space, and are homogeneous under the affine group of the plane — and every smooth surface has a unique model surface tangent to it at each point. These model surfaces are _Klein geometries_ in the sense of [Felix Klein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Klein "Felix Klein")'s [Erlangen programme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlangen_programme "Erlangen programme"). More generally, an n-dimensional affine space is a [Klein geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein_geometry "Klein geometry") for the [affine group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_group "Affine group")Aff(_n_), the stabilizer of a point being the [general linear group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_linear_group "General linear group")GL(_n_). An affine n-manifold is then a manifold which looks infinitesimally like n-dimensional affine space.

### Motivation from tensor calculus

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Affine_connection&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Motivation from tensor calculus")]

[![Image 2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/Affine_connection_example.svg/250px-Affine_connection_example.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Affine_connection_example.svg)

Historically, people used the covariant derivative (or Levi-Civita connection given by the metric) to describe the variation rate of a vector along the direction of another vector. Here on the punctured 2-dimensional Euclidean space, the blue vector field X sends the [one-form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-form "One-form")d _r_ to 0.07 everywhere. The red vector field Y sends the one-form _r_ d _θ_ to 0.5 _r_ everywhere. Endorsed by the metric d _s_ 2 = d _r_ 2 + _r_ 2 d _θ_ 2, the Levi-Civita connection ∇_Y_ _X_ is 0 everywhere, indicating X has no change along Y. In other words, X[parallel transports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_transport "Parallel transport") along each [concentric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentric "Concentric") circle. ∇_X_ _Y_ = _Y_/_r_ everywhere, which sends _r_ d _θ_ to 0.5 everywhere, implying Y has a "constant" changing rate on the radial direction.

The second motivation for affine connections comes from the notion of a [covariant derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariant_derivative "Covariant derivative") of vector fields. Before the advent of coordinate-independent methods, it was necessary to work with vector fields by [embedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedding "Embedding") their respective [Euclidean vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector "Euclidean vector") into an [atlas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_(topology) "Atlas (topology)"). These components can be differentiated, but the derivatives do not transform in a manageable way under changes of coordinates.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] Correction terms were introduced by [Elwin Bruno Christoffel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elwin_Bruno_Christoffel "Elwin Bruno Christoffel") (following ideas of [Bernhard Riemann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernhard_Riemann "Bernhard Riemann")) in the 1870s so that the (corrected) derivative of one vector field along another transformed [covariantly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariant_transformation "Covariant transformation") under coordinate transformations — these correction terms subsequently came to be known as [Christoffel symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christoffel_symbol "Christoffel symbol").

This idea was developed into the theory of _absolute differential calculus_ (now known as [tensor calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_calculus "Tensor calculus")) by [Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorio_Ricci-Curbastro "Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro") and his student [Tullio Levi-Civita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tullio_Levi-Civita "Tullio Levi-Civita") between 1880 and the turn of the 20th century.

Tensor calculus really came to life, however, with the advent of [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein")'s theory of [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity") in 1915. A few years after this, Levi-Civita formalized the unique connection associated to a Riemannian metric, now known as the [Levi-Civita connection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levi-Civita_connection "Levi-Civita connection"). More general affine connections were then studied around 1920, by [Hermann Weyl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Weyl "Hermann Weyl"),[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_connection#cite_note-7) who developed a detailed mathematical foundation for general relativity, and [Élie Cartan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89lie_Cartan "Élie Cartan"),[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_connection#cite_note-Cartan-affine-8) who made the link with the geometrical ideas coming from surface theory.

The complex history has led to the development of widely varying approaches to and generalizations of the affine connection concept.

The most popular approach is probably the definition motivated by covariant derivatives. On the one hand, the ideas of Weyl were taken up by physicists in the form of [gauge theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_theory "Gauge theory") and [gauge covariant derivatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_covariant_derivative "Gauge covariant derivative"). On the other hand, the notion of covariant differentiation was abstracted by [Jean-Louis Koszul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Louis_Koszul "Jean-Louis Koszul"), who defined (linear or Koszul) [connections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection_(vector_bundle) "Connection (vector bundle)") on [vector bundles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_bundle "Vector bundle"). In this language, an affine connection is simply a [covariant derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariant_derivative "Covariant derivative") or (linear) [connection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection_(vector_bundle) "Connection (vector bundle)") on the [tangent bundle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_bundle "Tangent bundle").

However, this approach does not explain the geometry behind affine connections nor how they acquired their name.[[c]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_connection#cite_note-9) The term really has its origins in the identification of tangent spaces in Euclidean space by translation: this property means that Euclidean n-space is an [affine space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_space "Affine space"). (Alternatively, Euclidean space is a [principal homogeneous space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_homogeneous_space "Principal homogeneous space") or [torsor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torsor "Torsor") under the group of translations, which is a subgroup of the affine group.) As mentioned in the introduction, there are several ways to make this precise: one uses the fact that an affine connection defines a notion of [parallel transport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_transport "Parallel transport") of vector fields along a curve. This also defines a parallel transport on the [frame bundle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_bundle "Frame bundle"). Infinitesimal parallel transport in the frame bundle yields another description of an affine connection, either as a Cartan connection for the affine group Aff(_n_) or as a principal GL(_n_) connection on the frame bundle.

Formal definition as a differential operator
--------------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Affine_connection&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Formal definition as a differential operator")]

Let M be a smooth [manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold "Manifold") and let Γ(T _M_) be the space of [vector fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_fields "Vector fields") on M, that is, the space of [smooth sections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_(fiber_bundle) "Section (fiber bundle)") of the [tangent bundle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_bundle "Tangent bundle")T _M_. Then an **affine connection** on M is a [bilinear map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilinear_map "Bilinear map")

![Image 3: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\Gamma (\mathrm {T} M)\times \Gamma (\mathrm {T} M)&\rightarrow \Gamma (\mathrm {T} M)\\(X,Y)&\mapsto \nabla _{X}Y\,,\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fd3eac0855932e82b2aac1099df1d5ec61a39f00)
such that for all f in the set of smooth functions on _M_, written _C_∞(_M_, **R**), and all vector fields _X_, _Y_ on M:

1.   ∇_fX Y_ = _f_ ∇_X Y_, that is, ∇ is _C_∞(_M_, **R**)-_linear_ in the first variable;
2.   ∇_X_(_fY_) = (∂_X_ _f_) _Y_ + _f_ ∇_X Y_, where ∂_X_ denotes the [directional derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directional_derivative "Directional derivative"); that is, ∇ satisfies _Leibniz rule_ in the second variable.

### Elementary properties

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Affine_connection&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Elementary properties")]

*   It follows from property 1 above that the value of ∇_X_ _Y_ at a point _x_ ∈ _M_ depends only on the value of X at x and not on the value of X on _M_ − {_x_}. It also follows from property 2 above that the value of ∇_X_ _Y_ at a point _x_ ∈ _M_ depends only on the value of Y on a neighbourhood of x.
*   If ∇1, ∇2 are affine connections then the value at x of ∇1

_X_ _Y_ − ∇2

_X_ _Y_ may be written Γ _x_(_X_ _x_, _Y_ _x_) where ![Image 4: {\displaystyle \Gamma _{x}:\mathrm {T} _{x}M\times \mathrm {T} _{x}M\to \mathrm {T} _{x}M}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e3ea39dec1cdc9117c8b92e0fa4dd98c463b8b49) is bilinear and depends smoothly on x (i.e., it defines a smooth [bundle homomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundle_homomorphism "Bundle homomorphism")). Conversely if ∇ is an affine connection and Γ is such a smooth bilinear bundle homomorphism (called a [connection form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection_form "Connection form") on M) then ∇ + Γ is an affine connection.
*   If M is an open subset of **R**_n_, then the tangent bundle of M is the [trivial bundle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trivial_bundle "Trivial bundle")_M_ × **R**_n_. In this situation there is a canonical affine connection d on M: any vector field Y is given by a smooth function V from M to **R**_n_; then d _X_ _Y_ is the vector field corresponding to the smooth function d _V_(_X_) = ∂_X_ _Y_ from M to **R**_n_. Any other affine connection ∇ on M may therefore be written ∇ = d + Γ, where Γ is a connection form on M.
*   More generally, a [local trivialization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_trivialization "Local trivialization") of the tangent bundle is a [bundle isomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundle_map "Bundle map") between the restriction of T _M_ to an open subset U of M, and _U_ × **R**_n_. The restriction of an affine connection ∇ to U may then be written in the form d + Γ where Γ is a connection form on U.

Parallel transport for affine connections
-----------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Affine_connection&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Parallel transport for affine connections")]

[![Image 5](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/Parallel_transport_sphere2.svg/250px-Parallel_transport_sphere2.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Parallel_transport_sphere2.svg)

Parallel transport of a tangent vector along a curve in the sphere.

Comparison of tangent vectors at different points on a manifold is generally not a well-defined process. An affine connection provides one way to remedy this using the notion of [parallel transport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_transport "Parallel transport"), and indeed this can be used to give a definition of an affine connection.

Let M be a manifold with an affine connection ∇. Then a vector field X is said to be **parallel** if ∇_X_ = 0 in the sense that for any vector field Y, ∇_Y_ _X_ = 0. Intuitively speaking, parallel vectors have _all their [derivatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative "Derivative") equal to zero_ and are therefore in some sense _constant_. By evaluating a parallel vector field at two points x and y, an identification between a tangent vector at x and one at y is obtained. Such tangent vectors are said to be **parallel transports** of each other.

Nonzero parallel vector fields do not, in general, exist, because the equation ∇_X_ = 0 is a [partial differential equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation "Partial differential equation") which is [overdetermined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overdetermined_system "Overdetermined system"): the [integrability condition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrability_condition "Integrability condition") for this equation is the vanishing of the **curvature** of ∇ (see below). However, if this equation is restricted to a [curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve "Curve") from x to y it becomes an [ordinary differential equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_differential_equation "Ordinary differential equation"). There is then a unique solution for any initial value of X at x.

More precisely, if _γ_: _I_ → _M_ a [smooth curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve "Curve") parametrized by an interval [_a_, _b_] and _ξ_ ∈ T _x_ _M_, where _x_ = _γ_(_a_), then a [vector field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_field "Vector field")X along γ (and in particular, the value of this vector field at _y_ = _γ_(_b_)) is called the **parallel transport of ξ along γ** if

1.   ∇_γ′_(_t_)_X_ = 0, for all _t_ ∈ [_a_, _b_]
2.   _X_ _γ_(_a_) = _ξ_.

Formally, the first condition means that X is parallel with respect to the [pullback connection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pullback_(differential_geometry) "Pullback (differential geometry)") on the [pullback bundle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pullback_bundle "Pullback bundle")_γ_∗T _M_. However, in a [local trivialization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_trivialization "Local trivialization") it is a first-order system of [linear ordinary differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_differential_equation "Linear differential equation"), which has a unique solution for any initial condition given by the second condition (for instance, by the [Picard–Lindelöf theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picard%E2%80%93Lindel%C3%B6f_theorem "Picard–Lindelöf theorem")).

Thus parallel transport provides a way of moving tangent vectors along a curve using the affine connection to keep them "pointing in the same direction" in an intuitive sense, and this provides a [linear isomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_isomorphism "Linear isomorphism") between the tangent spaces at the two ends of the curve. The isomorphism obtained in this way will in general depend on the choice of the curve: if it does not, then parallel transport along every curve can be used to define parallel vector fields on M, which can only happen if the curvature of ∇ is zero.

A linear isomorphism is determined by its action on an [ordered basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_(linear_algebra)#Ordered_bases_and_coordinates "Basis (linear algebra)") or **frame**. Hence parallel transport can also be characterized as a way of transporting elements of the (tangent) [frame bundle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_bundle "Frame bundle")GL(_M_) along a curve. In other words, the affine connection provides a **lift** of any curve γ in M to a curve γ̃ in GL(_M_).

Formal definition on the frame bundle
-------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Affine_connection&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Formal definition on the frame bundle")]

An affine connection may also be defined as a [principal GL(_n_) connection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection_(principal_bundle) "Connection (principal bundle)")ω on the [frame bundle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_bundle "Frame bundle")F _M_ or GL(_M_) of a manifold M. In more detail, ω is a smooth map from the tangent bundle T(F _M_) of the frame bundle to the space of _n_ × _n_ matrices (which is the [Lie algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_algebra "Lie algebra")**gl**(_n_) of the [Lie group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_group "Lie group")GL(_n_) of invertible _n_ × _n_ matrices) satisfying two properties:

1.   ω is [equivariant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivariant "Equivariant") with respect to the action of GL(_n_) on T(F _M_) and **gl**(_n_);
2.   _ω_(_X ξ_) = _ξ_ for any ξ in **gl**(_n_), where X ξ is the vector field on F _M_ corresponding to ξ.

Such a connection ω immediately defines a [covariant derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariant_derivative "Covariant derivative") not only on the tangent bundle, but on [vector bundles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_bundle "Vector bundle")[associated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_bundle "Associated bundle") to any [group representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_representation "Group representation") of GL(_n_), including bundles of [tensors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor "Tensor") and [tensor densities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_density "Tensor density"). Conversely, an affine connection on the tangent bundle determines an affine connection on the frame bundle, for instance, by requiring that ω vanishes on tangent vectors to the lifts of curves to the frame bundle defined by parallel transport.

The frame bundle also comes equipped with a [solder form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_bundle#Solder_form "Frame bundle")_θ_: T(F _M_) → **R**_n_ which is **horizontal** in the sense that it vanishes on [vertical vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_bundle "Vertical bundle") such as the point values of the vector fields X ξ: Indeed θ is defined first by projecting a tangent vector (to F _M_ at a frame f) to M, then by taking the components of this tangent vector on M with respect to the frame f. Note that θ is also GL(_n_)-equivariant (where GL(_n_) acts on **R**_n_ by matrix multiplication).

The pair (_θ_, _ω_) defines a [bundle isomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundle_isomorphism "Bundle isomorphism") of T(F _M_) with the trivial bundle F _M_ × **aff**(_n_), where **aff**(_n_) is the [Cartesian product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_product "Cartesian product") of **R**_n_ and **gl**(_n_) (viewed as the Lie algebra of the affine group, which is actually a [semidirect product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semidirect_product "Semidirect product") – see below).

Affine connections as Cartan connections
----------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Affine_connection&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Affine connections as Cartan connections")]

Affine connections can be defined within Cartan's general framework.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_connection#cite_note-10) In the modern approach, this is closely related to the definition of affine connections on the frame bundle. Indeed, in one formulation, a Cartan connection is an [absolute parallelism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_parallelism "Absolute parallelism") of a principal bundle satisfying suitable properties. From this point of view the **aff**(_n_)-valued one-form (_θ_, _ω_): T(F _M_) → **aff**(_n_) on the frame bundle (of an [affine manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_manifold "Affine manifold")) is a Cartan connection. However, Cartan's original approach was different from this in a number of ways:

*   the concept of frame bundles or principal bundles did not exist;
*   a connection was viewed in terms of parallel transport between infinitesimally nearby points;[[d]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_connection#cite_note-11)
*   this parallel transport was affine, rather than linear;
*   the objects being transported were not tangent vectors in the modern sense, but elements of an [affine space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_space "Affine space") with a marked point, which the Cartan connection ultimately _identifies_ with the tangent space.

### Explanations and historical intuition

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Affine_connection&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Explanations and historical intuition")]

The points just raised are easiest to explain in reverse, starting from the motivation provided by surface theory. In this situation, although the planes being rolled over the surface are tangent planes in a naive sense, the notion of a [tangent space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_space "Tangent space") is really an [infinitesimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_(infinitesimal) "Differential (infinitesimal)") notion,[[e]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_connection#cite_note-13) whereas the planes, as [affine subspaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_subspace "Affine subspace") of **R**3, are [infinite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity "Infinity") in extent. However these affine planes all have a marked point, the point of contact with the surface, and they are tangent to the surface at this point. The confusion therefore arises because an affine space with a marked point can be identified with its tangent space at that point. However, the parallel transport defined by rolling does not fix this origin: it is [affine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_transformation "Affine transformation") rather than linear; the linear parallel transport can be recovered by applying a translation.

Abstracting this idea, an affine manifold should therefore be an n-manifold M with an affine space _A_ _x_, of dimension n, _attached_ to each _x_ ∈ _M_ at a marked point _a_ _x_ ∈ _A_ _x_, together with a method for transporting elements of these affine spaces along any curve C in M. This method is required to satisfy several properties:

1.   for any two points _x_, _y_ on C, parallel transport is an [affine transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_transformation "Affine transformation") from _A_ _x_ to _A_ _y_;
2.   parallel transport is defined infinitesimally in the sense that it is differentiable at any point on C and depends only on the tangent vector to C at that point;
3.   the derivative of the parallel transport at x determines a [linear isomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_isomorphism "Linear isomorphism") from T _x_ _M_ to T _a x_ _A_ _x_.

These last two points are quite hard to make precise,[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_connection#cite_note-14) so affine connections are more often defined infinitesimally. To motivate this, it suffices to consider how affine [frames of reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frames_of_reference "Frames of reference") transform infinitesimally with respect to parallel transport. (This is the origin of Cartan's [method of moving frames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_moving_frames "Method of moving frames").) An affine frame at a point consists of a list (_p_, **e**1,… **e**_n_), where _p_ ∈ _A_ _x_[[f]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_connection#cite_note-15) and the **e**_i_ form a basis of T _p_(_A_ _x_). The affine connection is then given symbolically by a first order [differential system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_system "Differential system")

![Image 6: {\displaystyle (*){\begin{cases}\mathrm {d} {p}&=\theta ^{1}\mathbf {e} _{1}+\cdots +\theta ^{n}\mathbf {e} _{n}\\\mathrm {d} \mathbf {e} _{i}&=\omega _{i}^{1}\mathbf {e} _{1}+\cdots +\omega _{i}^{n}\mathbf {e} _{n}\end{cases}}\quad i=1,2,\ldots ,n}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/550992c2d3451dece8236697b22c7f8d01bc4234)
defined by a collection of [one-forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_forms "Differential forms")(_θ j_, _ω j

i_). Geometrically, an affine frame undergoes a displacement travelling along a curve γ from _γ_(_t_) to _γ_(_t_ + _δt_) given (approximately, or infinitesimally) by

![Image 7: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}p(\gamma (t+\delta t))-p(\gamma (t))&=\left(\theta ^{1}\left(\gamma '(t)\right)\mathbf {e} _{1}+\cdots +\theta ^{n}\left(\gamma '(t)\right)\mathbf {e} _{n}\right)\mathrm {\delta } t\\\mathbf {e} _{i}(\gamma (t+\delta t))-\mathbf {e} _{i}(\gamma (t))&=\left(\omega _{i}^{1}\left(\gamma '(t)\right)\mathbf {e} _{1}+\cdots +\omega _{i}^{n}\left(\gamma '(t)\right)\mathbf {e} _{n}\right)\delta t\,.\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/34f341f6c342466497ac16e3f827de46562fe3fc)
Furthermore, the affine spaces _A_ _x_ are required to be tangent to M in the informal sense that the displacement of _a_ _x_ along γ can be identified (approximately or infinitesimally) with the tangent vector _γ_′(_t_) to γ at _x_ = _γ_(_t_) (which is the infinitesimal displacement of x). Since

![Image 8: {\displaystyle a_{x}(\gamma (t+\delta t))-a_{x}(\gamma (t))=\theta \left(\gamma '(t)\right)\delta t\,,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/dedf255991cd26f49da1a5f8704ec1a504e4a545)
where θ is defined by _θ_(_X_) = _θ_ 1(_X_)**e**1 + … + _θ_ _n_(_X_)**e**_n_, this identification is given by θ, so the requirement is that θ should be a linear isomorphism at each point.

The tangential affine space _A_ _x_ is thus identified intuitively with an _infinitesimal affine neighborhood_ of x.

The modern point of view makes all this intuition more precise using principal bundles (the essential idea is to replace a frame or a _variable_ frame by the space of all frames and functions on this space). It also draws on the inspiration of [Felix Klein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Klein "Felix Klein")'s [Erlangen programme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlangen_programme "Erlangen programme"),[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_connection#cite_note-16) in which a _geometry_ is defined to be a [homogeneous space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_space "Homogeneous space"). Affine space is a geometry in this sense, and is equipped with a _flat_ Cartan connection. Thus a general affine manifold is viewed as _curved_ deformation of the flat model geometry of affine space.

### Affine space as the flat model geometry

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Affine_connection&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Affine space as the flat model geometry")]

#### Definition of an affine space

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Affine_connection&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Definition of an affine space")]

Informally, an **[affine space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_space "Affine space")** is a [vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space") without a fixed choice of [origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_(mathematics) "Origin (mathematics)"). It describes the geometry of [points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(mathematics) "Point (mathematics)") and [free vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(geometric) "Vector (geometric)") in space. As a consequence of the lack of origin, points in affine space cannot be added together as this requires a choice of origin with which to form the parallelogram law for vector addition. However, a vector v may be added to a point p by placing the initial point of the vector at p and then transporting p to the terminal point. The operation thus described _p_ → _p_ + _v_ is the **translation** of p along v. In technical terms, affine n-space is a set **A**_n_ equipped with a [free transitive action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_action_(mathematics) "Group action (mathematics)") of the vector group **R**_n_ on it through this operation of translation of points: **A**_n_ is thus a [principal homogeneous space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_homogeneous_space "Principal homogeneous space") for the vector group **R**_n_.

The [general linear group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_linear_group "General linear group")GL(_n_) is the [group of transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_group "Transformation group") of **R**_n_ which preserve the _linear structure_ of **R**_n_ in the sense that _T_(_av_ + _bw_) = _aT_(_v_) + _bT_(_w_). By analogy, the **[affine group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_group "Affine group")**Aff(_n_) is the group of transformations of **A**_n_ preserving the _affine structure_. Thus _φ_ ∈ Aff(_n_) must _preserve translations_ in the sense that

![Image 9: {\displaystyle \varphi (p+v)=\varphi (p)+T(v)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0f47561d18347cc2b0c114f295abb3bc3513e0d5)
where T is a general linear transformation. The map sending _φ_ ∈ Aff(_n_) to _T_ ∈ GL(_n_) is a [group homomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_homomorphism "Group homomorphism"). Its [kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(algebra) "Kernel (algebra)") is the group of translations **R**_n_. The [stabilizer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_action_(mathematics)#Orbits_and_stabilizers "Group action (mathematics)") of any point p in A can thus be identified with GL(_n_) using this projection: this realises the affine group as a [semidirect product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semidirect_product "Semidirect product") of GL(_n_) and **R**_n_, and affine space as the [homogeneous space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_space "Homogeneous space")Aff(_n_)/GL(_n_).

#### Affine frames and the flat affine connection

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Affine_connection&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Affine frames and the flat affine connection")]

An _affine frame_ for A consists of a point _p_ ∈ _A_ and a basis (**e**1,… **e**_n_) of the vector space T _p_ _A_ = **R**_n_. The general linear group GL(_n_) acts freely on the set F _A_ of all affine frames by fixing p and transforming the basis (**e**1,… **e**_n_) in the usual way, and the map π sending an affine frame (_p_; **e**1,… **e**_n_) to p is the [quotient map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotient_map "Quotient map"). Thus F _A_ is a [principal GL(_n_)-bundle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_bundle "Principal bundle") over A. The action of GL(_n_) extends naturally to a free transitive action of the affine group Aff(_n_) on F _A_, so that F _A_ is an Aff(_n_)-[torsor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_homogeneous_space "Principal homogeneous space"), and the choice of a reference frame identifies F _A_ → _A_ with the principal bundle Aff(_n_) → Aff(_n_)/GL(_n_).

On F _A_ there is a collection of _n_ + 1 functions defined by

![Image 10: {\displaystyle \pi (p;\mathbf {e} _{1},\dots ,\mathbf {e} _{n})=p}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c5860a5d65bf253faf51dc7858ceb74b8b227978)
(as before) and

![Image 11: {\displaystyle \varepsilon _{i}(p;\mathbf {e} _{1},\dots ,\mathbf {e} _{n})=\mathbf {e} _{i}\,.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1ab375bf38d06f8884f0ae070c596b44e947c34d)
After choosing a basepoint for A, these are all functions with values in **R**_n_, so it is possible to take their [exterior derivatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exterior_derivative "Exterior derivative") to obtain [differential 1-forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_1-form "Differential 1-form") with values in **R**_n_. Since the functions ε i yield a basis for **R**_n_ at each point of F _A_, these 1-forms must be expressible as sums of the form

![Image 12: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\mathrm {d} \pi &=\theta ^{1}\varepsilon _{1}+\cdots +\theta ^{n}\varepsilon _{n}\\\mathrm {d} \varepsilon _{i}&=\omega _{i}^{1}\varepsilon _{1}+\cdots +\omega _{i}^{n}\varepsilon _{n}\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5ef7df77beda6b69fd5eb799341d4d183186c644)
for some collection (_θ i_, _ω k

j_)1 ≤ _i_, _j_, _k_ ≤ _n_ of real-valued one-forms on Aff(_n_). This system of one-forms on the principal bundle F _A_ → _A_ defines the affine connection on A.

Taking the exterior derivative a second time, and using the fact that d 2 = 0 as well as the [linear independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linearly_independent "Linearly independent") of the ε i, the following relations are obtained:

![Image 13: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\mathrm {d} \theta ^{j}-\sum _{i}\omega _{i}^{j}\wedge \theta ^{i}&=0\\\mathrm {d} \omega _{i}^{j}-\sum _{k}\omega _{k}^{j}\wedge \omega _{i}^{k}&=0\,.\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/db3e7894e35cc1cc0c61809c3144e79c631e4704)
These are the [Maurer–Cartan equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurer%E2%80%93Cartan_equation "Maurer–Cartan equation") for the Lie group Aff(_n_) (identified with F _A_ by the choice of a reference frame). Furthermore:

*   the [Pfaffian system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pfaffian_system "Pfaffian system")_θ j_ = 0 (for all j) is [integrable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrability_condition "Integrability condition"), and its [integral manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_manifold "Integral manifold") are the fibres of the principal bundle Aff(_n_) → _A_.
*   the Pfaffian system _ω j

i_ = 0 (for all _i_, _j_) is also integrable, and its integral manifolds define parallel transport in F _A_.

Thus the forms (_ω j

i_) define a flat [principal connection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection_(principal_bundle) "Connection (principal bundle)") on F _A_ → _A_.

For a strict comparison with the motivation, one should actually define parallel transport in a principal Aff(_n_)-bundle over A. This can be done by [pulling back](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pullback_bundle "Pullback bundle")F _A_ by the smooth map _φ_: **R**_n_ × _A_ → _A_ defined by translation. Then the composite _φ_′ ∗ F _A_ → F _A_ → _A_ is a principal Aff(_n_)-bundle over A, and the forms (_θ i_, _ω k

j_)[pull back](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pullback_(differential_geometry) "Pullback (differential geometry)") to give a flat principal Aff(_n_)-connection on this bundle.

### General affine geometries: formal definitions

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Affine_connection&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: General affine geometries: formal definitions")]

An affine space, as with essentially any smooth [Klein geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein_geometry "Klein geometry"), is a manifold equipped with a flat Cartan connection. More general affine manifolds or affine geometries are obtained easily by dropping the flatness condition expressed by the Maurer-Cartan equations. There are several ways to approach the definition and two will be given. Both definitions are facilitated by the realisation that 1-forms (_θ i_, _ω k

j_) in the flat model fit together to give a 1-form with values in the Lie algebra **aff**(_n_) of the affine group Aff(_n_).

In these definitions, M is a smooth n-manifold and _A_ = Aff(_n_)/GL(_n_) is an affine space of the same dimension.

#### Definition via absolute parallelism

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Affine_connection&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Definition via absolute parallelism")]

Let M be a manifold, and P a principal GL(_n_)-bundle over M. Then an **affine connection** is a 1-form η on P with values in **aff**(_n_) satisfying the following properties

1.   η is equivariant with respect to the action of GL(_n_) on P and **aff**(_n_);
2.   _η_(_X ξ_) = _ξ_ for all ξ in the Lie algebra **gl**(_n_) of all _n_ × _n_ matrices;
3.   η is a linear isomorphism of each tangent space of P with **aff**(_n_).

The last condition means that η is an **[absolute parallelism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_parallelism "Absolute parallelism")** on P, i.e., it identifies the tangent bundle of P with a trivial bundle (in this case _P_ × **aff**(_n_)). The pair (_P_, _η_) defines the structure of an **affine geometry** on M, making it into an **affine manifold**.

The affine Lie algebra **aff**(_n_) splits as a semidirect product of **R**_n_ and **gl**(_n_) and so η may be written as a pair (_θ_, _ω_) where θ takes values in **R**_n_ and ω takes values in **gl**(_n_). Conditions 1 and 2 are equivalent to ω being a principal GL(_n_)-connection and θ being a horizontal equivariant 1-form, which induces a [bundle homomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundle_homomorphism "Bundle homomorphism") from T _M_ to the [associated bundle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_bundle "Associated bundle")_P_ ×GL(_n_)**R**_n_. Condition 3 is equivalent to the fact that this bundle homomorphism is an isomorphism. (However, this decomposition is a consequence of the rather special structure of the affine group.) Since P is the [frame bundle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_bundle "Frame bundle") of _P_ ×GL(_n_)**R**_n_, it follows that θ provides a bundle isomorphism between P and the frame bundle F _M_ of M; this recovers the definition of an affine connection as a principal GL(_n_)-connection on F _M_.

The 1-forms arising in the flat model are just the components of θ and ω.

#### Definition as a principal affine connection

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Affine_connection&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Definition as a principal affine connection")]

An **affine connection** on M is a principal Aff(_n_)-bundle Q over M, together with a principal GL(_n_)-subbundle P of Q and a principal Aff(_n_)-connection α (a 1-form on Q with values in **aff**(_n_)) which satisfies the following (generic) _Cartan condition_. The **R**_n_ component of pullback of α to P is a horizontal equivariant 1-form and so defines a bundle homomorphism from T _M_ to _P_ ×GL(_n_)**R**_n_: this is required to be an isomorphism.

#### Relation to the motivation

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Affine_connection&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Relation to the motivation")]

Since Aff(_n_) acts on A, there is, associated to the principal bundle Q, a bundle _**A**_ = _Q_ ×Aff(_n_)_A_, which is a fiber bundle over M whose fiber at x in M is an affine space _A_ _x_. A [section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_(fiber_bundle) "Section (fiber bundle)")a of **A** (defining a marked point _a_ _x_ in _A_ _x_ for each _x_ ∈ _M_) determines a principal GL(_n_)-subbundle P of Q (as the bundle of stabilizers of these marked points) and vice versa. The principal connection α defines an [Ehresmann connection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehresmann_connection "Ehresmann connection") on this bundle, hence a notion of parallel transport. The Cartan condition ensures that the distinguished section a always moves under parallel transport.

### Curvature and torsion

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Affine_connection&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: Curvature and torsion")]

Curvature and torsion are the main invariants of an affine connection. As there are many equivalent ways to define the notion of an affine connection, so there are many different ways to define curvature and torsion.

From the Cartan connection point of view, the curvature is the failure of the affine connection η to satisfy the Maurer–Cartan equation

![Image 14: {\displaystyle \mathrm {d} \eta +{\tfrac {1}{2}}[\eta \wedge \eta ]=0,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d3c2e421eebf09b6ad8f285b378bd806fda66004)
where the second term on the left hand side is the [wedge product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedge_product "Wedge product") using the [Lie bracket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_bracket_of_vector_fields "Lie bracket of vector fields") in **aff**(_n_) to contract the values. By expanding η into the pair (_θ_, _ω_) and using the structure of the Lie algebra **aff**(_n_), this left hand side can be expanded into the two formulae

![Image 15: {\displaystyle \mathrm {d} \theta +\omega \wedge \theta \quad {\text{and}}\quad \mathrm {d} \omega +\omega \wedge \omega \,,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f2a5f954e3e5a56ab6cc17c4ff351ed0864e5b5c)
where the wedge products are evaluated using matrix multiplication. The first expression is called the [torsion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torsion_tensor "Torsion tensor") of the connection, and the second is also called the curvature.

These expressions are differential 2-forms on the total space of a frame bundle. However, they are horizontal and equivariant, and hence define tensorial objects. These can be defined directly from the induced covariant derivative ∇ on T _M_ as follows.

The [torsion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torsion_of_connection "Torsion of connection") is given by the formula

![Image 16: {\displaystyle T^{\nabla }(X,Y)=\nabla _{X}Y-\nabla _{Y}X-[X,Y].}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4f19951452740bcb62cd949121b3571e305b0ddd)
If the torsion vanishes, the connection is said to be _torsion-free_ or _symmetric_.

The curvature is given by the formula

![Image 17: {\displaystyle R_{X,Y}^{\nabla }Z=\nabla _{X}\nabla _{Y}Z-\nabla _{Y}\nabla _{X}Z-\nabla _{[X,Y]}Z.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0dbbbbf6baa6b3bd6432093e89b2be32f36df9a2)
Note that [_X_, _Y_] is the [Lie bracket of vector fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_bracket_of_vector_fields "Lie bracket of vector fields")

![Image 18: {\displaystyle [X,Y]=\left(X^{j}\partial _{j}Y^{i}-Y^{j}\partial _{j}X^{i}\right)\partial _{i}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/40689fe0b2339f0df9519e0138de4681fb36a29e)
in [Einstein notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_notation "Einstein notation"). This is independent of coordinate system choice and

![Image 19: {\displaystyle \partial _{i}=\left({\frac {\partial }{\partial \xi ^{i}}}\right)_{p}\,,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a03a8b68c35ac3e315b0b76677bb700cfee5c714)
the tangent vector at point p of the i th [coordinate curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_curve "Coordinate curve"). The ∂_i_ are a natural basis for the tangent space at point p, and the X i the corresponding coordinates for the vector field _X_ = _X i_ ∂_i_.

When both curvature and torsion vanish, the connection defines a [pre-Lie algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-Lie_algebra "Pre-Lie algebra") structure on the space of global sections of the tangent bundle.

### The Levi-Civita connection

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Affine_connection&action=edit&section=20 "Edit section: The Levi-Civita connection")]

If (_M_, _g_) is a [Riemannian manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_manifold "Riemannian manifold") then there is a unique affine connection ∇ on M with the following two properties:

*   the connection is torsion-free, i.e., _T_∇ is zero, so that ∇_X_ _Y_ − ∇_Y_ _X_ = [_X_, _Y_];
*   parallel transport is an isometry, i.e., the inner products (defined using g) between tangent vectors are preserved.

This connection is called the **[Levi-Civita connection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levi-Civita_connection "Levi-Civita connection")**.

The term "symmetric" is often used instead of torsion-free for the first property. The second condition means that the connection is a **[metric connection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_connection "Metric connection")** in the sense that the Riemannian metric g is parallel: ∇_g_ = 0. For a torsion-free connection, the condition is equivalent to the identity _X_ _g_(_Y_, _Z_) = _g_(∇_X_ _Y_, _Z_) + _g_(_Y_, ∇_X_ _Z_), "compatibility with the metric".[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_connection#cite_note-17) In local coordinates the components of the form are called [Christoffel symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christoffel_symbols "Christoffel symbols"): because of the uniqueness of the Levi-Civita connection, there is a formula for these components in terms of the components of g.

Since straight lines are a concept in affine geometry, affine connections define a generalized notion of (parametrized) straight lines on any affine manifold, called affine geodesics. Abstractly, a parametric curve _γ_: _I_ → _M_ is a straight line if its tangent vector remains parallel and equipollent with itself when it is transported along γ. From the linear point of view, an affine connection M distinguishes the affine geodesics in the following way: a smooth curve _γ_: _I_ → _M_ is an **affine geodesic** if ![Image 20: {\displaystyle {\dot {\gamma }}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c250a2cd0b68db26e9663686345f6cee8074d5f0) is parallel transported along γ, that is

![Image 21: {\displaystyle \tau _{t}^{s}{\dot {\gamma }}(s)={\dot {\gamma }}(t)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e1577e79ae5f514d9e1de1691132cefbd0e8b713)
where _τ s

t_: T _γ s M_ → T _γ t M_ is the parallel transport map defining the connection.

In terms of the infinitesimal connection ∇, the derivative of this equation implies

![Image 22: {\displaystyle \nabla _{{\dot {\gamma }}(t)}{\dot {\gamma }}(t)=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/85345c0b0be91d3df5147dfccffbc98a3a7b99ba)
for all _t_ ∈ _I_.

Conversely, any solution of this differential equation yields a curve whose tangent vector is parallel transported along the curve. For every _x_ ∈ _M_ and every _X_ ∈ T _x_ _M_, there exists a unique affine geodesic _γ_: _I_ → _M_ with _γ_(0) = _x_ and _γ̇_(0) = _X_ and where I is the maximal open interval in **R**, containing 0, on which the geodesic is defined. This follows from the [Picard–Lindelöf theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picard%E2%80%93Lindel%C3%B6f_theorem "Picard–Lindelöf theorem"), and allows for the definition of an [exponential map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_map_(Riemannian_geometry) "Exponential map (Riemannian geometry)") associated to the affine connection.

In particular, when M is a ([pseudo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo-Riemannian_manifold "Pseudo-Riemannian manifold")-)[Riemannian manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_manifold "Riemannian manifold") and ∇ is the [Levi-Civita connection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levi-Civita_connection "Levi-Civita connection"), then the affine geodesics are the usual [geodesics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic "Geodesic") of Riemannian geometry and are the locally distance minimizing curves.

The geodesics defined here are sometimes called **affinely parametrized**, since a given straight line in M determines a parametric curve γ through the line up to a choice of affine reparametrization _γ_(_t_) → _γ_(_at_ + _b_), where a and b are constants. The tangent vector to an affine geodesic is parallel and equipollent along itself. An unparametrized geodesic, or one which is merely parallel along itself without necessarily being equipollent, need only satisfy

![Image 23: {\displaystyle \nabla _{\dot {\gamma }}{\dot {\gamma }}=k{\dot {\gamma }}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0438ff991d7d5acca4fe6fb3f1601fe83fc4463b)
for some function k defined along γ. Unparametrized geodesics are often studied from the point of view of [projective connections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_connection "Projective connection").

An affine connection defines a notion of **[development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_(differential_geometry) "Development (differential geometry)")** of curves. Intuitively, development captures the notion that if x t is a curve in M, then the affine tangent space at _x_ 0 may be _rolled_ along the curve. As it does so, the marked point of contact between the tangent space and the manifold traces out a curve C t in this affine space: the development of x t.

In formal terms, let _τ_ 0

_t_: T _x t M_ → T _x_ 0 _M_ be the linear parallel transport map associated to the affine connection. Then the development C t is the curve in T _x_ 0 _M_ starts off at 0 and is parallel to the tangent of x t for all time t:

![Image 24: {\displaystyle {\dot {C}}_{t}=\tau _{t}^{0}{\dot {x}}_{t}\,,\quad C_{0}=0.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ee63bbd56a9ef1bd28ea4b559c8a226d070978e4)
In particular, x t is a _geodesic_ if and only if its development is an affinely parametrized straight line in T _x_ 0 _M_.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_connection#cite_note-18)

Surface theory revisited
------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Affine_connection&action=edit&section=23 "Edit section: Surface theory revisited")]

If M is a surface in **R**3, it is easy to see that M has a natural affine connection. From the linear connection point of view, the covariant derivative of a vector field is defined by differentiating the vector field, viewed as a map from M to **R**3, and then projecting the result orthogonally back onto the tangent spaces of M. It is easy to see that this affine connection is torsion-free. Furthermore, it is a metric connection with respect to the Riemannian metric on M induced by the inner product on **R**3, hence it is the Levi-Civita connection of this metric.

### Example: the unit sphere in Euclidean space

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Affine_connection&action=edit&section=24 "Edit section: Example: the unit sphere in Euclidean space")]

Let ⟨ , ⟩ be the usual [scalar product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_product "Scalar product") on **R**3, and let **S**2 be the unit sphere. The tangent space to **S**2 at a point x is naturally identified with the vector subspace of **R**3 consisting of all vectors orthogonal to x. It follows that a vector field Y on **S**2 can be seen as a map _Y_: **S**2 → **R**3 which satisfies

![Image 25: {\displaystyle \langle Y_{x},x\rangle =0\,,\quad \forall x\in \mathbf {S} ^{2}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1bf40ff40c924a34642270914f371f47ad74fca3)
Denote as d _Y_ the differential (Jacobian matrix) of such a map. Then we have:

**Lemma**. The formula ![Image 26: {\displaystyle (\nabla _{Z}Y)_{x}=\mathrm {d} Y_{x}(Z_{x})+\langle Z_{x},Y_{x}\rangle x}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d2145d05085759f06680f3291d305213d8c61c41)defines an affine connection on **S**2 with vanishing torsion.**Proof**. It is straightforward to prove that ∇ satisfies the Leibniz identity and is _C_∞(**S**2) linear in the first variable. So all that needs to be proved here is that the map above does indeed define a tangent vector field. That is, we need to prove that for all x in **S**2![Image 27: {\displaystyle {\bigl \langle }(\nabla _{Z}Y)_{x},x{\bigr \rangle }=0\,.\qquad {\text{(Eq.1)}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2f4baa29b87957aa48e55140f8fd29b85d96bb7e)Consider the map ![Image 28: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}f:\mathbf {S} ^{2}&\to \mathbf {R} \\x&\mapsto \langle Y_{x},x\rangle \,.\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/045e59e0c9c8697ac3ce9be523a6b254863010ba)The map _f_ is constant, hence its differential vanishes. In particular ![Image 29: {\displaystyle \mathrm {d} f_{x}(Z_{x})={\bigl \langle }(\mathrm {d} Y)_{x}(Z_{x}),x(\gamma '(t)){\bigr \rangle }+\langle Y_{x},Z_{x}\rangle =0\,.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6c5b888b431d7c1f1ecedc339e03b1dc1fc31315)Equation 1 above follows.

1.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_connection#cite_ref-3)**a _linear connection_ is also frequently called affine connection or simply _connection_,[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_connection#cite_note-FOOTNOTELee199751-1) So that there is no agreement on the precise definitions of these terms (John M. Lee simply calls it **connection**).[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_connection#cite_note-FOOTNOTELee201891-2)
2.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_connection#cite_ref-6)**Cartan explains that he has borrowed this term (i.e. "affine connection") from the H. Weyl's book and referred to it (_Space-Time-Matter_), although he used it in more general context.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_connection#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAkivisRosenfeld1993213-5)
3.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_connection#cite_ref-9)**As a result, many mathematicians use the term _linear connection_ (instead of _affine connection_) for a connection on the tangent bundle, on the grounds that [parallel transport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_transport "Parallel transport") is linear and not affine. However, the same property holds for any (Koszul or linear Ehresmann) [connection on a vector bundle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection_(vector_bundle) "Connection (vector bundle)"). Originally the term _affine connection_ is short for an affine _[connection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartan\_connection "Cartan connection")_ in the sense of Cartan, and this implies that the connection is defined on the tangent bundle, rather than an arbitrary vector bundle. The notion of a linear Cartan connection does not really make much sense, because linear representations are not transitive.
4.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_connection#cite_ref-11)**It is difficult to make Cartan's intuition precise without invoking [smooth infinitesimal analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_infinitesimal_analysis "Smooth infinitesimal analysis"), but one way is to regard his points being _variable_, that is maps from some unseen parameter space into the manifold, which can then be differentiated.
5.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_connection#cite_ref-13)**Classically, the [tangent space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_space "Tangent space") was viewed as an infinitesimal approximation, while in modern differential geometry, tangent spaces are often defined in terms of differential objects such as derivations.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_connection#cite_note-12)
6.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_connection#cite_ref-15)**This can be viewed as a choice of origin: actually it suffices to consider only the case _p_ = _a_ _x_; Cartan implicitly identifies this with x in M.
