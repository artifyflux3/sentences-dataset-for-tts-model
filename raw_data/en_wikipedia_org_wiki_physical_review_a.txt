932205193 Links Journal homepage Physical Review A (also known as PRA [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] ) is a monthly peer-reviewed scientific journal published by the American Physical Society covering atomic, molecular, and optical physics and quantum information . As of 2021 [update] the editor was Jan M. Rost ( Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems ).

[ 6 ] History [ edit ] In 1893, the Physical Review was established at Cornell University . It was taken over by the American Physical Society (formed in 1899) in 1913. In 1970, Physical Review was subdivided into Physical Review A , B , C , and D . At that time, section A was subtitled Physical Review A: General Physics . In 1990, a process was started to split this journal into two, resulting in the creation of Physical Review E in 1993. Hence, in 1993, Physical Review A changed its statement of scope to Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics.

In January 2007, the section of Physical Review E that published papers on classical optics was merged into Physical Review A , unifying the classical and quantum parts of optics into a single journal.

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] In 2016, Physical Review A broadened its formal statement of coverage to explicitly include quantum information, which has been a section within the journal since 1998.

[ 9 ] Rapid Communications [ edit ] Physical Review A Rapid Communications was introduced in 1981 to provide a venue for quick publication of high-impact articles similar to Physical Review Letters , but for a more specialized audience. As of May 1, 2012, the editors have made the requirement for significance in Rapid articles more explicit.

[ 10 ] In addition, as of March 8, 2010, the editors have placed newly published Rapid Communications articles on rotation as highlights on the Physical Review A website, to give them more visibility.

[ 11 ] Editors' Suggestions [ edit ] In August 2013, Physical Review A started marking a few papers published in the journal that the editors found to be of particular interest, importance, or clarity as Editors' Suggestions to give them higher visibility.

[ 12 ] Abstracting and indexing [ edit ] As of 2020 [update] Physical Review journals were abstracted and indexed in: [ 13 ] Chemical Abstracts Service / CASSI [ 14 ] Inspec [ 15 ] Clarivate Web of Science Google Scholar INSPIRE-HEP NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) PubMed Scopus According to the Journal Citation Reports , the journal had an impact factor of 3.989 in 2020.
