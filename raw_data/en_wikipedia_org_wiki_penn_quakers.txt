Whether they are fact or fiction remains unknown.

Harvard and Yale .  In the early days of the university there was a race among the students of Harvard , Yale , and the University of Pennsylvania .  The Harvard team wore their famous crimson ; Yale teams wore their traditional blue.  When the Penn participants were asked which colors would represent their team, they replied that they would be wearing the colors of the two teams they would soon beat.  The Penn athletes won the race, and Penn teams used those colors from then on.

George Washington's Clothing .  It is rumored that George Washington visited the university during one of his terms as President of the United States .  He is supposed to have arrived wearing a blue jacket and breeches with a red waistcoat .  The next day, the students decked the university in these colors and donned red and blue themselves to honor the president.  Afterward, it was decided to use these colors by the university.

Penn's and Franklin's Coats of Arms .  When the university was creating a seal and coat of arms it decided to use elements from both Benjamin Franklin 's and William Penn 's coats-of-arms—Franklin had helped to found the university, and Penn had founded the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania .  Franklin's coat of arms contained the color red and Penn's featured a blue chevron .

As University Archivist Francis James Dallett pointed out in 1983: "Eighteenth-century American academic institutions simply did not have colors."  This leaves one inclined to relegate the above explanations to the realm of local myth.

A resolution adopted by the university trustees on May 17, 1910, states:
"The colors shall be red and blue,...The colors [of the University of Pennsylvania] shall conform to the present standards used by the United States Government in its flags."  Thus it is possible to determine when Penn adopted the colors red and blue, at least officially.
