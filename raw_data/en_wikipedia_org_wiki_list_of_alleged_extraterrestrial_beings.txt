[ 1 ] List [ edit ] Flatwoods monster [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Tall humanoid with a spade-shaped head.

[ 2 ] Greys [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Also spelled "grays" (in American English ).

Roswell incident Grey-skinned (sometimes green-skinned) humanoids, usually 1 m (3.3 ft) tall, hairless, with large heads, black almond-shaped eyes, nostrils without a nose, slits for mouths, no ears and 3–4 fingers including thumb. Greys have been the predominant extraterrestrial beings of alleged alien contact since the 1960s.

[ 5 ] Hopkinsville goblin [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] Small, greenish-silver humanoids.

[ 9 ] Little green men [ 10 ] Diminutive green humanoids. Even though a few abductions have referred to green skin, no report has ever involved anything that would fit the description of "little green men". They are included here only for cultural reference, however, this does not solely dispute the existence of little green men.

[ 10 ] Nordic aliens [ 11 ] [ 12 ] Sometimes called Space Brothers [ 13 ] Plejaren (previously known as Pleiadeans from the Pleiades ) [ 14 ] Venusians [ 13 ] [ 15 ] Tall whites [ 16 ] Agarthans from Agartha [ 17 ] Humanoids with stereotypical " Nordic features" (tall, blonde hair, blue eyes) and which have featured in several cases of contact.

Cryptozoological animals and cryptobotanical plants , including those from folklore , religion (e.g.

golem ), mythology (e.g.

dwarf (see also dwarfism ); giants from Atlantis (see also gigantism ), etc.), and some reports of ghosts , poltergeists , and time travellers (alleged) Mothman (see also American folklore ) Jersey Devil Loch Ness Monster (Nessie) ( dinosauroid ) African Nommo Mokele-mbembe Yokai (many varieties) Quinametzin Rephaite Loveland Frogman Some claim that many of the allegedly real creatures from the Fortean archives (see also: Fortean Times and William R. Corliss ) and related reports of anomalous phenomena [ 18 ] are actually of extraterrestrial or mixed origin, such as in the extraterrestrial hypothesis , the interdimensional hypothesis , or the cryptoterrestrial hypothesis . Sometimes these creatures are associated with the occult or with esotericism , or linked with supernatural or paranormal phenomena. Others dismiss these explanations in favor of skepticism , cultural tracking , or the psychosocial hypothesis such as in cases of mass hysteria . Some of these alleged encounters have turned out to be hoaxes or scams to boost local tourism , sell more newspapers or more fringe science books.

Reptilians and reptiloids (sometimes spelled as reptillians ) [ 19 ] Ancient astronauts (see ancient astronauts in popular culture , Ancient Aliens ) Draconians [ 17 ] Orion reptillian-humanoid matriarchy (see reptilian conspiracy theory ) List of reptilian humanoids Lizard Man of Scape Ore Swamp Fictionalized portrayals: They Live , V , Stargate , Star Trek , Worldwar , Gamehendge , etc.

Tall, scaly humanoids. Reptilian humanoid beings date back at least as far as Ancient Egypt , with the crocodile-headed river god Sobek . The reptilian conspiracy theory has been advocated by David Icke .

Rods [ 20 ] or skyfish Elongated visual artifacts appearing in photos and video recordings, sometimes claimed to be extraterrestrial beings. Generally thought to be caused by motion blur from flying insects.
