All three agencies that have assigned names to tropical cyclones within the Western Pacific have retired the names of significant tropical cyclones, with the PAGASA retiring names if a cyclone has caused at least ₱ 1 billion (~20 million USD) in damage and/or have caused at least 300 deaths within the Philippines.

Since 1963, the naming lists have been revised in 1979, 1985, 2001 (after a contest called the "Name a Bagyo Contest", conducted by the PAGASA in 1998, where 140 entries were submitted in 1998 to revise the naming system for typhoons within their area of responsibility starting that season), 2005 (for various reasons, including to help minimize confusion in the historical records and to remove the names that might have negative associations with real persons), and 2021 (where the "Reserved List" was introduced).

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Within this list, all information with regards to intensity is taken from while the system was in the Philippine Area of Responsibility, and is thus taken from the PAGASA's archives, rather than the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) or Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA)'s archives.

Background [ edit ] Main articles: Tropical cyclone naming , List of historical tropical cyclone names , and History of tropical cyclone naming The Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) for tropical cyclone warnings The practice of using names to identify tropical cyclones goes back several centuries, with tropical cyclones being named after affected places, saints or things they hit before the formal start of naming in the Western Pacific.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] These included the Kamikaze , 1906 Hong Kong typhoon , 1922 Swatow typhoon and the 1934 Muroto typhoon .

[ 6 ] The practice of retiring significant names was started during 1955 by the United States Weather Bureau in the Atlantic Ocean, after hurricanes Carol , Edna , and Hazel struck the Northeastern United States and caused a significant amount of damage in the previous year.

[ 4 ] Initially the names were only designed to be retired for ten years after which they might be reintroduced, however, in the 1969 Interdepartmental Hurricane Conference, it was decided that any significant hurricane in the future would have its name permanently retired.

[ 4 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] PAGASA retires a name it has assigned after the season if the system has either killed at least 300 people or caused at least PHP1 billion in damage to infrastructure and agriculture, based on reports from the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council .

[ 10 ] Several names have also been removed for reasons other than causing a significant amount of death/destruction, such as Gloria in 2005, (due to then-president Gloria Macapagal Arroyo 's disputed win in the 2004 Philippine presidential election and her subsequent involvement in the Hello Garci scandal ) and Nonoy in 2015 (due to similarities to the term "Noynoy", then-president Benigno Aquino III 's nickname).

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] As of 2025 [update] , 85 tropical cyclone names have been retired, with the most recent being Aghon , Enteng , Julian , Kristine , Leon , Nika , Ofel , and Pepito of the 2024 season .
