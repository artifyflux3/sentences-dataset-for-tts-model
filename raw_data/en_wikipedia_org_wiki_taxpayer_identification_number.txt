A Taxpayer Identification Number ( TIN ) is an identifying number used for tax purposes in the United States and in other countries under the Common Reporting Standard . In the United States it is also known as a Tax Identification Number ( TIN ) or Federal Taxpayer Identification Number ( FTIN ). A TIN may be assigned by the Social Security Administration (SSA) or by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

ITINs [ edit ] ITINs are used by aliens who may or may not have the right to work in the US, such as aliens on temporary visas and non-resident aliens with US income.

EINs [ edit ] EINs are used by employers, sole proprietors , corporations , LLCs , partnerships , non-profit associations , trusts , estates of decedents, government agencies, certain individuals, and other business entities.
