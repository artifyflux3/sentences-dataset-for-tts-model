Informally, a probability measure Œº is a maximising measure for some function f if the integral of f with respect to Œº is "as big as it can be".  The theory of maximising measures is relatively young and quite little is known about their general structure and properties.

Definition [ edit ] Let X be a topological space and let T : X ‚Üí X be a continuous function .  Let Inv( T ) denote the set of all Borel probability measures on X that are invariant under T , i.e., for every Borel-measurable subset A of X , Œº ( T ‚àí1 ( A ))¬†= Œº ( A ).  (Note that, by the Krylov-Bogolyubov theorem , if X is compact and metrizable ,  Inv( T ) is non-empty.)  Define, for continuous functions f : X ‚Üí R , the maximum integral function Œ≤ by Œ≤ Œ≤ ( f ) := sup { ‚à´ ‚à´ X f d ŒΩ ŒΩ | ŒΩ ŒΩ ‚àà ‚àà I n v ( T ) } .

{\displaystyle \beta (f):=\sup \left.\left\{\int _{X}f\,\mathrm {d} \nu \right|\nu \in \mathrm {Inv} (T)\right\}.} A probability measure Œº in Inv( T ) is said to be a maximising measure for f if ‚à´ ‚à´ X f d Œº Œº = Œ≤ Œ≤ ( f ) .

{\displaystyle \int _{X}f\,\mathrm {d} \mu =\beta (f).} Properties [ edit ] It can be shown that if X is a compact space , then Inv( T ) is also compact with respect to the topology of weak convergence of measures .  Hence, in this case, each continuous function f : X ‚Üí R has at least one maximising measure.

If T is a continuous map of a compact metric space X into itself and E is a topological vector space that is densely and continuously embedded in C ( X ; R ), then the set of all f in E that have a unique maximising measure is equal to a countable intersection of open dense subsets of E .
