Find sources: "Quasi-invariant measure" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( December 2009 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) In mathematics , a quasi-invariant measure μ with respect to a transformation T , from a measure space X to itself, is a measure which, roughly speaking, is multiplied by a numerical function of T . An important class of examples occurs when X is a smooth manifold M , T is a diffeomorphism of M , and μ is any measure that locally is a measure with base the Lebesgue measure on Euclidean space . Then the effect of T on μ is locally expressible as multiplication by the Jacobian determinant of the derivative ( pushforward ) of T .

To express this idea more formally in measure theory terms, the idea is that the Radon–Nikodym derivative of the transformed measure μ′ with respect to μ should exist everywhere; or that the two measures should be equivalent (i.e. mutually absolutely continuous ): μ μ ′ = T ∗ ∗ ( μ μ ) ≈ ≈ μ μ .

{\displaystyle \mu '=T_{*}(\mu )\approx \mu .} That means, in other words, that T preserves the concept of a set of measure zero . Considering the whole equivalence class of measures ν , equivalent to μ , it is also the same to say that T preserves the class as a whole, mapping any such measure to another such. Therefore, the concept of quasi-invariant measure is the same as invariant measure class .

In general, the 'freedom' of moving within a measure class by multiplication gives rise to cocycles , when transformations are composed.

As an example, Gaussian measure on Euclidean space R n is not invariant under translation (like Lebesgue measure is), but is quasi-invariant under all translations.

It can be shown that if E is a separable Banach space and μ is a locally finite Borel measure on E that is quasi-invariant under all translations by elements of E , then either dim( E ) < +∞ or μ is the trivial measure μ ≡ 0.
