The large semicircle has unit diameter, BC = 1– r , and AB = r = AB/AC.

In geometry , an Archimedean circle is any circle constructed from an arbelos that has the same radius as each of Archimedes' twin circles .  If the arbelos is normed such that the diameter of its outer (largest) half circle has a length of 1 and r denotes the radius of any of the inner half circles, then the radius ρ of such an Archimedean circle is given by ρ ρ = 1 2 r ( 1 − − r ) , {\displaystyle \rho ={\frac {1}{2}}r\left(1-r\right),} There are over fifty different known ways to construct Archimedean circles.

[ 1 ] Origin [ edit ] Example of two Archimedean circles An Archimedean circle was first constructed by Archimedes in his Book of Lemmas . In his book, he constructed what is now known as Archimedes' twin circles .

Radius [ edit ] If a {\displaystyle a} and b {\displaystyle b} are the radii of the small semicircles of the arbelos, the radius of an Archimedean circle is equal to R = a b a + b {\displaystyle R={\frac {ab}{a+b}}} This radius is thus 1 R = 1 a + 1 b {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{R}}={\frac {1}{a}}+{\frac {1}{b}}} .

The Archimedean circle with center C {\displaystyle C} (as in the figure at right) is tangent to the tangents from the centers of the small semicircles to the other small semicircle.

Other Archimedean circles finders [ edit ] Leon Bankoff [ edit ] Leon Bankoff constructed other Archimedean circles called Bankoff's triplet circle and Bankoff's quadruplet circle.

The Schoch line (cyan line) and examples of Woo circles (green).

Thomas Schoch [ edit ] In 1978 Thomas Schoch found a dozen more Archimedean circles (the Schoch circles ) that have been published in 1998.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] He also constructed what is known as the Schoch line .

[ 4 ] Peter Y. Woo [ edit ] Peter Y. Woo considered the Schoch line, and with it, he was able to create a family of infinitely many Archimedean circles known as the Woo circles .

[ 5 ] Frank Power [ edit ] In the summer of 1998, Frank Power introduced four more Archimedes circles known as Archimedes' quadruplets .

[ 6 ] Archimedean circles in Wasan geometry (Japanese geometry) [ edit ] In 1831, Nagata (永田岩三郎遵道) proposed a sangaku problem involving two Archimedean circles, which are denoted by W6 and W7 in [3]. 
In 1853, Ootoba (大鳥羽源吉守敬) proposed a sangaku problem involving an Archimedean circle.
