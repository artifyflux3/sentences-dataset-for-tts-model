subgenera ) is a taxonomic rank directly below genus .

In the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature , a subgeneric name can be used independently or included in a species name , in parentheses, placed between the generic name and the specific epithet : e.g. the tiger cowry of the Indo-Pacific, Cypraea ( Cypraea ) tigris Linnaeus , which belongs to the subgenus Cypraea of the genus Cypraea . However, it is not mandatory, or even customary, when giving the name of a species, to include the subgeneric name.

In the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICNafp), the subgenus is one of the possible subdivisions of a genus. There is no limit to the number of divisions that are permitted within a genus by adding the prefix "sub-" or in other ways as long as no confusion can result.

[ 1 ] The secondary ranks of section and series are subordinate to subgenus.

[ 1 ] An example is Banksia subg.

Isostylis , a subgenus of the large Australian genus Banksia .

[ 2 ] The ICNafp requires an explicit "connecting term" to indicate the rank of the division within the genus.

[ 3 ] Connecting terms are usually abbreviated, e.g. "subg." for "subgenus", and are not italicized.

In zoological nomenclature, when a genus is split into subgenera, the originally described population is retained as the "nominotypical subgenus" or "nominate subgenus", which repeats the same name as the genus. For example, Panthera ( Panthera ) pardus , a leopard . In botanical nomenclature the same principle applies, although the terminology is different. Thus the subgenus that contains the original type of the genus Rhododendron is Rhododendron subg.

Rhododendron . Such names are called "autonyms".
