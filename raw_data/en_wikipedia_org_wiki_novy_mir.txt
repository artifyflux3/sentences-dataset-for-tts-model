Novy Mir Editor Andrei Vasilevsky Categories Literary magazine Frequency Monthly First issue January 1925 ( 1925-01 ) Country Russia Based in Moscow Language Russian Novy Mir ( Russian : Новый мир , lit.

'New World', IPA: [ˈnovɨj ˈmʲir] ) is a Russian-language monthly literary magazine .

[ 1 ] History [ edit ] Novy Mir has been published in Moscow since January 1925.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] It was supposed to be modelled on the popular pre- Soviet literary magazine Mir Bozhy ("God's World"), [ 3 ] which was published from 1892 to 1906, and its follow-up, Sovremenny Mir ("Contemporary World"), [ 4 ] which was published from 1906 to 1917.

Novy Mir mainly published prose that approved of the general line of the Communist Party .

In the early 1960s, Novy Mir changed its political stance, leaning to a dissident position. In November 1962 the magazine became famous for publishing Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn 's groundbreaking One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich , a novella about a prisoner of the Gulag . In the same year its circulation was about 150,000 copies a month.

[ 5 ] The magazine continued publishing controversial articles and stories about various aspects of Soviet and Russian history despite the fact that its editor-in-chief, Alexander Tvardovsky , facing significant political pressure , resigned in February 1970. With the appointment of Sergey Zalygin in 1986, at the beginning of perestroika , the magazine practised increasingly bold criticism of the Soviet government , including figures such as Mikhail Gorbachev . It also published fiction and poetry by previously banned writers, such as George Orwell , Joseph Brodsky and Vladimir Nabokov .
