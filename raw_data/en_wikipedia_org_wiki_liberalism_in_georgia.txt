[ 1 ] Ilia Chavchavadze was a Georgian public figure, journalist, publisher, writer and poet who spearheaded the revival of the Georgian national movement in the second half of the 19th century and played a major role in the creation of Georgian civil society during the Russian rule of Georgia. He is Georgia's " most universally revered hero ." [ 2 ] Liberalism in Georgia ( Georgian : ლიბერალიზმი საქართველოში , romanized : liberalizmi sakartveloshi ) is a political and moral philosophy based on what liberals consider the unalienable rights of the individual. The fundamental liberal ideals of freedom of speech , freedom of the press , freedom of religion , the separation of church and state , the right to due process and equality under the law are widely accepted as a common foundation of liberalism.

The history of liberalism in Georgia can be split into two periods: the first period began in 1860s with the Tergdaleulebi movement and ended in 1921, when Georgia was sovietized ; the second period began in 1991 with Georgia declaring its independence from the Soviet Union.

[ 1 ] Liberalism in Georgia was persecuted severely both by the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union .
