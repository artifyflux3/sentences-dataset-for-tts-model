[ 1 ] Candidates can be nominated by Mensa members and former award winners. After being checked by an internal commission, all Mensa members can vote for which nominee to win the award.

History [ edit ] The German IQ Award is held annually since 2004. The winners are: 2004: Albrecht Beutelspacher for his Mathematikum 2005: Günther Jauch for his TV show "Der Große IQ-Test" ( The big IQ test ) 2006: Die Sendung mit der Maus , a children's TV series 2007: Ranga Yogeshwar , a German TV host 2008: Dieter Nuhr , a comedian 2009: Harald Lesch , an astrophysicist and TV host 2010: Spektrum der Wissenschaft , the German issue of Scientific American Since 2011 the award is issued in the two categories "Wissenschaft/Innovation" ( Science/Innovation ) and "Kultur/Medien" ( Culture/Media ): 2011: Heatball and Richard David Precht 2012: Eckart von Hirschhausen and due to the same number of votes Franz Porzsolt and Florian Freistetter [ de ] for ScienceBlogs 2013: Auticon 2014: Jonny Lee Miller . Initially Edward Snowden had been nominated by Mensa members, and the IQ commission had approved his nomination, the managing board of Mensa revoked Snowden's nomination because "Mensa is not allowed to comment on political issues." Jonny Lee Miller then garnered the most votes and won the award.
