Sphere rotating around one of its diameters

**Rotation around a fixed axis** or **axial rotation** is a special case of [rotational motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotational_motion "Rotational motion") around an _[axis of rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis\_of\_rotation "Axis of rotation")_ fixed, stationary, or static in [three-dimensional space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_space "Three-dimensional space"). This type of motion excludes the possibility of the instantaneous axis of rotation changing its [orientation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientation_(geometry) "Orientation (geometry)") and cannot describe such phenomena as [wobbling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutation "Nutation") or [precession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precession "Precession"). According to [Euler's rotation theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_rotation_theorem "Euler's rotation theorem"), simultaneous rotation along a number of stationary axes at the same time is impossible; if two rotations are forced at the same time, a new axis of rotation will result.

This concept assumes that the rotation is also stable, such that no [torque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque "Torque") is required to keep it going. The [kinematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinematics "Kinematics") and [dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamics_(mechanics) "Dynamics (mechanics)") of rotation around a fixed axis of a rigid body are mathematically much simpler than those for [free rotation of a rigid body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigid_body_dynamics#Rigid-body_angular_momentum "Rigid body dynamics"); they are entirely analogous to those of [linear motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_motion "Linear motion") along a single fixed direction, which is not true for _free rotation of a rigid body_. The expressions for the [kinetic energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy "Kinetic energy") of the object, and for the forces on the parts of the object, are also simpler for rotation around a fixed axis, than for general rotational motion. For these reasons, rotation around a fixed axis is typically taught in introductory physics courses after students have mastered [linear motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_motion "Linear motion"); the full generality of rotational motion is not usually taught in introductory physics classes.

Translation and rotation
------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rotation_around_a_fixed_axis&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Translation and rotation")]

An example of rotation. Each part of the [worm drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worm_drive "Worm drive")—both the worm and the worm gear—is rotating on its own axis.

A _rigid body_ is an object of a finite extent in which all the distances between the component particles are constant. No truly rigid body exists; external forces can deform any solid. For our purposes, then, a rigid body is a solid which requires large forces to deform it appreciably.

A change in the position of a particle in three-dimensional space can be completely specified by three coordinates. A change in the position of a rigid body is more complicated to describe. It can be regarded as a combination of two distinct types of motion: translational motion and circular motion.

Purely _[translational motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation\_(geometry) "Translation (geometry)")_ occurs when every particle of the body has the same instantaneous velocity as every other particle; then the path traced out by any particle is exactly parallel to the path traced out by every other particle in the body. Under translational motion, the change in the position of a rigid body is specified completely by three coordinates such as _x_, _y_, and _z_ giving the [displacement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_(vector) "Displacement (vector)") of any point, such as the center of mass, fixed to the rigid body.

Purely _rotational motion_ occurs if every particle in the body moves in a circle about a single line. This line is called the axis of rotation. Then the radius [vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(geometry) "Vector (geometry)") from the axis to all particles undergo the same angular displacement at the same time. The axis of rotation need not go through the body. In general, any rotation can be specified completely by the three angular displacements with respect to the rectangular-coordinate axes _x_, _y_, and _z_. Any change in the position of the rigid body is thus completely described by three translational and three rotational coordinates.

Any displacement of a rigid body may be arrived at by first subjecting the body to a displacement followed by a rotation, or conversely, to a rotation followed by a displacement. We already know that for any collection of particles—whether at rest with respect to one another, as in a rigid body, or in relative motion, like the exploding fragments of a shell, the acceleration of the center of mass is given by ![Image 3: {\displaystyle F_{\mathrm {net} }=Ma_{\mathrm {cm} }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/da30d722f7f69201eb869b38fe40defc46f9c3b3) where _M_ is the total mass of the system and _a_ cm is the acceleration of the center of mass. There remains the matter of describing the rotation of the body about the center of mass and relating it to the external forces acting on the body. The kinematics and dynamics of _rotational motion around a single axis_ resemble the kinematics and dynamics of translational motion; rotational motion around a single axis even has a work-energy theorem analogous to that of particle dynamics.

### Angular displacement

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rotation_around_a_fixed_axis&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Angular displacement")]

Given a particle that moves along the circumference of a circle of radius ![Image 4: {\displaystyle r}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0d1ecb613aa2984f0576f70f86650b7c2a132538), having moved an arc length ![Image 5: {\displaystyle s}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/01d131dfd7673938b947072a13a9744fe997e632), its angular position is ![Image 6: {\displaystyle \theta }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6e5ab2664b422d53eb0c7df3b87e1360d75ad9af) relative to its initial position, where ![Image 7: {\displaystyle \theta ={\frac {s}{r}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0f7d68caa29ae24caf4c436f270327373a36367d).

In mathematics and physics it is conventional to treat the [radian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radian "Radian"), a unit of plane angle, as 1, often omitting it. Units are converted as follows: ![Image 8: {\displaystyle 360^{\circ }=2\pi {\text{ rad}}\,,\quad 1{\text{ rad}}={\frac {180^{\circ }}{\pi }}\approx 57.27^{\circ }.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/feea8a2419fd8f85d741c1c4743660b6838f488c)

An angular displacement is a change in angular position: ![Image 9: {\displaystyle \Delta \theta =\theta _{2}-\theta _{1},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2f6928f03a1f672d2822924be16a9144478c1c40) where ![Image 10: {\displaystyle \Delta \theta }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/29b08ad75317619c93fa5ec35bf00c9ea4d219c4) is the angular displacement, ![Image 11: {\displaystyle \theta _{1}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7f84b9443d095623e02fd287cd095123d70b0278) is the initial angular position and ![Image 12: {\displaystyle \theta _{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0ed6ea624b20b153403979ffaf5434fc36de2990) is the final angular position.

Change in angular displacement per unit time is called angular velocity with direction along the axis of rotation. The symbol for angular velocity is ![Image 13: {\displaystyle \omega }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/48eff443f9de7a985bb94ca3bde20813ea737be8) and the units are typically rad s−1. Angular speed is the magnitude of angular velocity. [![Image 14: {\displaystyle {\overline {\omega }}={\frac {\Delta \theta }{\Delta t}}={\frac {\theta _{2}-\theta _{1}}{t_{2}-t_{1}}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5a0adfad5080a15fe57b9ce5c198df1621c7b670)](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:MathWikibase&qid=Q161635)

The instantaneous angular velocity is given by [![Image 15: {\displaystyle \omega (t)={\frac {d\theta }{dt}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6f77156c1ebbe10c014e493d9380ef5bdd477c26)](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:MathWikibase&qid=Q161635)

Using the formula for angular position and letting ![Image 16: {\displaystyle v={\frac {ds}{dt}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/52931df917fb9cbd33d9a41bce2979743f80f28c), we have also [![Image 17: {\displaystyle \omega ={\frac {d\theta }{dt}}={\frac {v}{r}},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9defa65de715309857dfbef8aa0ab647deaffd43)](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:MathWikibase&qid=Q161635) where ![Image 18: {\displaystyle v}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e07b00e7fc0847fbd16391c778d65bc25c452597) is the translational speed of the particle.

Angular velocity and [frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency "Frequency") are related by [![Image 19: {\displaystyle \omega ={2\pi f}\,.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e66e274f0312117e25354fc94602894c44a44082)](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:MathWikibase&qid=Q161635)

### Angular acceleration

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rotation_around_a_fixed_axis&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Angular acceleration")]

A changing angular velocity indicates the presence of an angular acceleration in rigid body, typically measured in rad s−2. The average angular acceleration ![Image 20: {\displaystyle {\overline {\alpha }}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2f87618f0333926d073474c3e9b99c65628f6c09) over a time interval Δ _t_ is given by [![Image 21: {\displaystyle {\overline {\alpha }}={\frac {\Delta \omega }{\Delta t}}={\frac {\omega _{2}-\omega _{1}}{t_{2}-t_{1}}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ef5d4e3533941bbbd8eed8fd718345fb945a879e)](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:MathWikibase&qid=Q186300)

The instantaneous acceleration _α_(_t_) is given by [![Image 22: {\displaystyle \alpha (t)={\frac {d\omega }{dt}}={\frac {d^{2}\theta }{dt^{2}}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/09eebc1f01bc31f336446f639566d0531b1111a8)](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:MathWikibase&qid=Q186300)

Thus, the angular acceleration is the rate of change of the angular velocity, just as acceleration is the rate of change of velocity.

The translational acceleration of a point on the object rotating is given by ![Image 23: {\displaystyle a=r\alpha ,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c674ee8a0328c84eb919240335e52ed99eaaa4c9) where _r_ is the radius or distance from the axis of rotation. This is also the [tangential component](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangential_component "Tangential component") of acceleration: it is tangential to the direction of motion of the point. If this component is 0, the motion is [uniform circular motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_circular_motion "Uniform circular motion"), and the velocity changes in direction only.

The radial acceleration (perpendicular to direction of motion) is given by ![Image 24: {\displaystyle a_{\mathrm {R} }={\frac {v^{2}}{r}}=\omega ^{2}r\,.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/613aaadd9ad1790826aeaf75269fe1e26962a149) It is directed towards the center of the rotational motion, and is often called the _centripetal acceleration_.

The angular acceleration is caused by the [torque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque "Torque"), which can have a positive or negative value in accordance with the convention of positive and negative angular frequency. The relationship between torque and angular acceleration (how difficult it is to start, stop, or otherwise change rotation) is given by the [moment of inertia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_of_inertia "Moment of inertia"): ![Image 25: {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\tau }}}=I\alpha }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0cee6ab1aeda4532d41c9f767cadba41a906b310).

### Equations of kinematics

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rotation_around_a_fixed_axis&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Equations of kinematics")]

When the angular acceleration is constant, the five quantities angular displacement ![Image 26: {\displaystyle \theta }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6e5ab2664b422d53eb0c7df3b87e1360d75ad9af), initial angular velocity ![Image 27: {\displaystyle \omega _{1}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e20e29ac56d6cc52eaeb2f9c0bf79ef706428ddf), final angular velocity ![Image 28: {\displaystyle \omega _{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7b914a8bfef5d1b9b106048afa0aab4a99251f38), angular acceleration ![Image 29: {\displaystyle \alpha }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b79333175c8b3f0840bfb4ec41b8072c83ea88d3), and time ![Image 30: {\displaystyle t}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/65658b7b223af9e1acc877d848888ecdb4466560) can be related by four [equations of kinematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinematics#Rotational_motion "Kinematics"):

![Image 31: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\omega _{2}&=\omega _{1}+\alpha t\\\theta &=\omega _{1}t+{\tfrac {1}{2}}\alpha t^{2}\\\omega _{2}^{2}&=\omega _{1}^{2}+2\alpha \theta \\\theta &={\tfrac {1}{2}}\left(\omega _{2}+\omega _{1}\right)t\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/01a26c05bb4a45ec8b6041375ddcec9eb067cb6f)

The moment of inertia of an object, symbolized by ![Image 32: {\displaystyle I}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/535ea7fc4134a31cbe2251d9d3511374bc41be9f), is a measure of the object's resistance to changes to its rotation. The moment of inertia is measured in kilogram metre² (kg m 2). It depends on the object's mass: increasing the mass of an object increases the moment of inertia. It also depends on the distribution of the mass: distributing the mass further from the center of rotation increases the moment of inertia by a greater degree. For a single particle of mass ![Image 33: {\displaystyle m}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0a07d98bb302f3856cbabc47b2b9016692e3f7bc) a distance ![Image 34: {\displaystyle r}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0d1ecb613aa2984f0576f70f86650b7c2a132538) from the axis of rotation, the moment of inertia is given by [![Image 35: {\displaystyle I=mr^{2}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8d3ce730f104d2f33db72caec81b55ac055d27c2)](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:MathWikibase&qid=Q165618)

Torque ![Image 36: {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\tau }}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/beb1359149db88a28c86f0a3030894b71610a224) is the twisting effect of a force **F** applied to a rotating object which is at position **r** from its axis of rotation. Mathematically, [![Image 37: {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\tau }}=\mathbf {r} \times \mathbf {F} ,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d78f7463314c4945dd5a3a81a7b138240d5866b6)](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:MathWikibase&qid=Q48103) where × denotes the [cross product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_product "Cross product"). A net torque acting upon an object will produce an angular acceleration of the object according to [![Image 38: {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\tau }}=I{\boldsymbol {\alpha }},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/10b7bf2030bd73d3f0748336701432cc33e3f2a5)](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:MathWikibase&qid=Q48103) just as **F** = _m_**a** in linear dynamics.

The work done by a torque acting on an object equals the magnitude of the torque times the angle through which the torque is applied: ![Image 39: {\displaystyle W=\tau \theta .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8f641929cefff93b89886e1c14ae6563f47544f5)

The power of a torque is equal to the work done by the torque per unit time, hence: ![Image 40: {\displaystyle P=\tau \omega .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fc81a350f22d34644acde6d5ee22a06d513b6ca6)

The angular momentum ![Image 41: {\displaystyle \mathbf {L} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6f5f750865376a1a4ae2b15a00b4ff9c75a66630) is a measure of the difficulty of bringing a rotating object to rest. It is given by [![Image 42: {\displaystyle \mathbf {L} =\sum \mathbf {r} \times \mathbf {p} ,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/adc510fe742a60dbd735b5350a33dbfdef43bf08)](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:MathWikibase&qid=Q161254) where the sum is taken over all particles in the object.

Angular momentum is the product of moment of inertia and angular velocity: [![Image 43: {\displaystyle \mathbf {L} =I{\boldsymbol {\omega }},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/afb18c91ec4284e8e4142e3b7fea1b3cb54baf40)](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:MathWikibase&qid=Q161254) just as **p** = _m_**v** in linear dynamics.

The analog of linear momentum in rotational motion is angular momentum. The greater the angular momentum of the spinning object such as a top, the greater its tendency to continue to spin.

The angular momentum of a rotating body is proportional to its mass and to how rapidly it is turning. In addition, the angular momentum depends on how the mass is distributed relative to the axis of rotation: the further away the mass is located from the axis of rotation, the greater the angular momentum. A flat disk such as a record turntable has less angular momentum than a hollow cylinder of the same mass and velocity of rotation.

Like linear momentum, angular momentum is vector quantity, and its conservation implies that the direction of the spin axis tends to remain unchanged. For this reason, the spinning top remains upright whereas a stationary one falls over immediately.

The angular momentum equation can be used to relate the moment of the resultant force on a body about an axis (sometimes called torque), and the rate of rotation about that axis.

Torque and angular momentum are related according to [![Image 44: {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\tau }}={\frac {d\mathbf {L} }{dt}},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/122a95cd7f28328ee8ce7861958e6a72e9ff5bb1)](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:MathWikibase&qid=Q48103) just as **F** = _d_**p**/_dt_ in linear dynamics. In the absence of an external torque, the angular momentum of a body remains constant. The conservation of angular momentum is notably demonstrated in [figure skating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figure_skating "Figure skating"): when pulling the arms closer to the body during a spin, the moment of inertia is decreased, and so the angular velocity is increased.

The kinetic energy ![Image 45: {\displaystyle K_{\text{rot}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8592616aef8109373a5529ee1d586f1dd3979be4) due to the rotation of the body is given by

![Image 46: {\displaystyle K_{\text{rot}}={\frac {1}{2}}I\omega ^{2},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4945da3aec37d5812070bba00800fa1dc0c0e0e7) just as ![Image 47: {\displaystyle K_{\text{trans}}={\tfrac {1}{2}}mv^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/82bfbd400e45e19621c0d86313dc97fd0b1238e2) in linear dynamics.

Kinetic energy is the energy of motion. The amount of translational kinetic energy found in two variables: the mass of the object (![Image 48: {\displaystyle m}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0a07d98bb302f3856cbabc47b2b9016692e3f7bc)) and the speed of the object (![Image 49: {\displaystyle v}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e07b00e7fc0847fbd16391c778d65bc25c452597)) as shown in the equation above. Kinetic energy must always be either zero or a positive value. While velocity can have either a positive or negative value, velocity squared will always be positive.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_around_a_fixed_axis#cite_note-1)

The above development is a special case of general rotational motion. In the general case, angular displacement, angular velocity, angular acceleration, and torque are considered to be [vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(geometry) "Vector (geometry)").

An angular displacement is considered to be a vector, pointing along the axis, of magnitude equal to that of ![Image 50: {\displaystyle \Delta \theta }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/29b08ad75317619c93fa5ec35bf00c9ea4d219c4). A [right-hand rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-hand_rule "Right-hand rule") is used to find which way it points along the axis; if the fingers of the right hand are curled to point in the way that the object has rotated, then the thumb of the right hand points in the direction of the vector.

The [angular velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_velocity "Angular velocity") vector also points along the [axis of rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_of_rotation "Axis of rotation") in the same way as the angular displacements it causes. If a disk spins counterclockwise as seen from above, its angular velocity vector points upwards. Similarly, the [angular acceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_acceleration "Angular acceleration") vector points along the axis of rotation in the same direction that the angular velocity would point if the angular acceleration were maintained for a long time.

The torque vector points along the axis around which the torque tends to cause rotation. To maintain rotation around a fixed axis, the total torque vector has to be along the axis, so that it only changes the magnitude and not the direction of the angular velocity vector. In the case of a hinge, only the component of the torque vector along the axis has an effect on the rotation, other forces and torques are compensated by the structure.

### Constant angular speed

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rotation_around_a_fixed_axis&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Constant angular speed")]

The simplest case of rotation not around a fixed axis is that of constant angular speed. Then the total torque is zero. For the example of the Earth rotating around its axis, there is very little friction. For a [fan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan_(mechanical) "Fan (mechanical)"), the motor applies a torque to compensate for friction. Similar to the fan, equipment found in the mass production manufacturing industry demonstrate rotation around a fixed axis effectively. For example, a multi-spindle lathe is used to rotate the material on its axis to effectively increase the productivity of cutting, deformation and turning operations.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_around_a_fixed_axis#cite_note-2) The angle of rotation is a linear function of time, which modulo 360° is a periodic function.

An example of this is the [two-body problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-body_problem "Two-body problem") with [circular orbits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_orbit "Circular orbit").

Internal [tensile stress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensile_stress "Tensile stress") provides the [centripetal force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centripetal_force "Centripetal force") that keeps a spinning object together. A [rigid body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigid_body "Rigid body") model neglects the accompanying [strain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(materials_science) "Strain (materials science)"). If the body is not rigid this strain will cause it to change shape. This is expressed as the object changing shape due to the "[centrifugal force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrifugal_force "Centrifugal force")".

Celestial bodies rotating about each other often have [elliptic orbits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_orbit "Elliptic orbit"). The special case of [circular orbits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_orbit "Circular orbit") is an example of a rotation around a fixed axis: this axis is the line through the [center of mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_mass "Center of mass") perpendicular to the plane of motion. The centripetal force is provided by [gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity "Gravity"), see also [two-body problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-body_problem "Two-body problem"). This usually also applies for a spinning celestial body, so it need not be solid to keep together unless the angular speed is too high in relation to its density. (It will, however, tend to become [oblate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblate_spheroid "Oblate spheroid").) For example, a spinning celestial body of water must take at least 3 hours and 18 minutes to rotate, regardless of size, or the water will separate[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]. If the density of the fluid is higher the time can be less. See [orbital period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_period "Orbital period").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_around_a_fixed_axis#cite_note-3)
