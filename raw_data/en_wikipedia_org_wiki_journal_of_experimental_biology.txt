History [ edit ] The British Journal of Experimental Biology was established in Edinburgh in 1923 ( Br. J. Exp. Biol.

: ISSN 0366-0788 ). It was published by Oliver and Boyd and edited by F. A. E. Crew with an Editorial Board of nine members, including Julian Huxley .

[ 4 ] Sir James Gray was appointed as the journal's first Editor-in-Chief in 1925 and the journal was renamed The Journal of Experimental Biology in 1929 ( ISSN 0022-0949 ).

[ 4 ] The journal has published ground-breaking work in the areas of biomechanics , skin transplantation and neurophysiology , and has published work by Nobel Prize winners Peter Medawar and August Krogh .

Journal content from 1923 is available online via the journal website. Content over six months old is freely available, and authors may choose to make their article Open Access by paying a subsidised fee.

[ 6 ] Scope and content [ edit ] Journal of Experimental Biology publishes original research articles, methods and techniques, and reviews in the field of comparative physiology.

[ 7 ] The journal currently publishes papers on a wide range of subjects from biomechanics and metabolic physiology , to neurophysiology and neuroethology . Besides peer-reviewed research, the journal features additional material such as "Inside JEB", which provides information about some of each issue's content, "Outside JEB", which discusses literature published in other journals, "JEB Classics", which revisit key papers published in the journal's history, and "Commentaries", which review topics of current interest.
