Publication Bias [ edit ] From the 133 research articles published between January 2015 and April 2020, 62.4% (83) had at least one member of the editorial board within the authors and 51.1% (68) carried the name of the same researcher ( Kevin D. Hyde ) as an author.

Within the top 10 publishing authors in the journal (more than 22 articles published in the period above) only two are not members of the editorial board.

The journal self-citation is considerably high. On average per article 17.33 citations refer to another Fungal Diversity article, this number can be as high as 156 in an article published in 2017.

These actions help to inflate the impact factor of the journal without being caught by the scrutinizing agencies.
