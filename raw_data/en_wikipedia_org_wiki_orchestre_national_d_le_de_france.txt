The Orchestre national d'Île-de-France is a French symphony orchestra with its administrative base in Alfortville .

The orchestra, made up of ninety-five permanent musicians, gives around a hundred concerts each season, thus offering Ile-de-France residents a wide variety of programs spanning three centuries of music.

The orchestra receives funding from the Conseil régional d’Île-de-France and the French Ministry of Culture.

The precursor orchestra to the current ensemble was the Orchestre symphonique d'Île de France.  In 1974, at the instigation of the culture minister Marcel Landowski, this orchestra was reorganised into the Orchestre national d'Île de France.  Since 1996, the orchestra has been administratively situated in Alfortville.

Past music directors include Jacques Mercier (1982-2002), Yoel Levi (2005-2012), and Enrique Mazzola (2012-2019). The current music director is Case Scaglione , starting with the 2019-2020 season.
