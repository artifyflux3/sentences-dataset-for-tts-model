 You deserve an explanation 

August 17: An important update for readers in the United States. 

Please don't skip this 1-minute read. It's Sunday, August 17, and we're running a short fundraiser to support Wikipedia. If you've lost count of how many times you've visited Wikipedia this year, we hope that means it's given you at least $2.75 of knowledge. Please join the 2% of readers who give what they can to keep this valuable resource ad-free and available for all.

After nearly 25 years, Wikipedia is still the internet we were promised—created by people, not by machines. It's not perfect, but it's not here to push a point of view. It's owned by a non-profit, not a giant technology company or a billionaire.

Most readers donate because Wikipedia is useful to them, others because Wikipedia is more important than ever. If you feel the same, please donate $2.75 now—or consider a monthly gift to help all year. Thank you.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Concept in topology

In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), the **isoperimetric dimension** of a [manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold "Manifold") is a notion of dimension that tries to capture how the _large-scale behavior_ of the manifold resembles that of a [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space") (unlike the [topological dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_dimension "Topological dimension") or the [Hausdorff dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_dimension "Hausdorff dimension") which compare different _local behaviors_ against those of the Euclidean space).

In the [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space"), the [isoperimetric inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoperimetry "Isoperimetry") says that of all bodies with the same volume, the ball has the smallest surface area. In other manifolds it is usually very difficult to find the precise body minimizing the surface area, and this is not what the isoperimetric dimension is about. The question we will ask is, what is _approximately_ the minimal surface area, whatever the body realizing it might be.

Formal definition
-----------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Isoperimetric_dimension&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Formal definition")]

We say about a [differentiable manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_manifold "Differentiable manifold")_M_ that it satisfies a _d_-dimensional **isoperimetric inequality** if for any open set _D_ in _M_ with a smooth boundary one has

area⁡(∂D)≥C vol⁡(D)(d−1)/d.{\displaystyle \operatorname {area} (\partial D)\geq C\operatorname {vol} (D)^{(d-1)/d}.}![Image 20: {\displaystyle \operatorname {area} (\partial D)\geq C\operatorname {vol} (D)^{(d-1)/d}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0e0eed96bc7587c5da847394dac1279a866e093c)
The notations vol and area refer to the regular notions of volume and surface area on the manifold, or more precisely, if the manifold has _n_ topological dimensions then vol refers to _n_-dimensional volume and area refers to (_n_−1)-dimensional volume. _C_ here refers to some constant, which does not depend on _D_ (it may depend on the manifold and on _d_).

The **isoperimetric dimension** of _M_ is the [supremum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infimum_and_supremum "Infimum and supremum") of all values of _d_ such that _M_ satisfies a _d_-dimensional isoperimetric inequality.

Examples
--------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Isoperimetric_dimension&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Examples")]

A _d_-dimensional Euclidean space has isoperimetric dimension _d_. This is the well known [isoperimetric problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoperimetry "Isoperimetry") — as discussed above, for the Euclidean space the constant _C_ is known precisely since the minimum is achieved for the ball.

An infinite cylinder (i.e. a [product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_product "Cartesian product") of the [circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_circle "Unit circle") and the [line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_line "Real line")) has topological dimension 2 but isoperimetric dimension 1. Indeed, multiplying any manifold with a compact manifold does not change the isoperimetric dimension (it only changes the value of the constant _C_). Any compact manifold has isoperimetric dimension 0.

It is also possible for the isoperimetric dimension to be larger than the topological dimension. The simplest example is the infinite [jungle gym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungle_gym "Jungle gym"), which has topological dimension 2 and isoperimetric dimension 3. See [[1]](https://web.archive.org/web/20040817075143/http://www.math.ucla.edu/~bon/jungle.html) for pictures and Mathematica code.

The [hyperbolic plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry "Hyperbolic geometry") has topological dimension 2 and isoperimetric dimension infinity. In fact the hyperbolic plane has positive [Cheeger constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheeger_constant "Cheeger constant"). This means that it satisfies the inequality

area⁡(∂D)≥C vol⁡(D),{\displaystyle \operatorname {area} (\partial D)\geq C\operatorname {vol} (D),}![Image 21: {\displaystyle \operatorname {area} (\partial D)\geq C\operatorname {vol} (D),}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f4a5147cc2c35afb6a5f1f90d7e806bac5098752)
which obviously implies infinite isoperimetric dimension.

Consequences of isoperimetry
----------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Isoperimetric_dimension&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Consequences of isoperimetry")]

A simple integration over _r_ (or sum in the case of graphs) shows that a _d_-dimensional isoperimetric inequality implies a _d_-dimensional [volume growth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_rate_(group_theory) "Growth rate (group theory)"), namely

vol⁡B(x,r)≥C r d{\displaystyle \operatorname {vol} B(x,r)\geq Cr^{d}}![Image 22: {\displaystyle \operatorname {vol} B(x,r)\geq Cr^{d}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/66269bf537652e7710d7e3b32577ba4a4a1ad6e5)
where _B_(_x_,_r_) denotes the ball of radius _r_ around the point _x_ in the [Riemannian distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_manifold "Riemannian manifold") or in the [graph distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_graph_theory#Distance "Glossary of graph theory"). In general, the opposite is not true, i.e. even uniformly exponential volume growth does not imply any kind of isoperimetric inequality. A simple example can be had by taking the graph **Z** (i.e. all the integers with edges between _n_ and _n_+1) and connecting to the vertex _n_ a complete [binary tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree "Binary tree") of height |_n_|. Both properties (exponential growth and 0 isoperimetric dimension) are easy to verify.

An interesting exception is the case of [groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics) "Group (mathematics)"). It turns out that a group with polynomial growth of order _d_ has isoperimetric dimension _d_. This holds both for the case of [Lie groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_group "Lie group") and for the [Cayley graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayley_graph "Cayley graph") of a [finitely generated group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finitely_generated_group "Finitely generated group").

A theorem of [Varopoulos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Varopoulos "Nicholas Varopoulos") connects the isoperimetric dimension of a graph to the rate of escape of [random walk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk "Random walk") on the graph. The result states

_Varopoulos' theorem: If G is a graph satisfying a d-dimensional isoperimetric inequality then_

p n(x,y)≤C n−d/2{\displaystyle p_{n}(x,y)\leq Cn^{-d/2}}![Image 23: {\displaystyle p_{n}(x,y)\leq Cn^{-d/2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b2af97ebe372c05b336de2e5202dd98a73813ad1)
_where_ p n(x,y){\textstyle p_{n}(x,y)}![Image 24: {\textstyle p_{n}(x,y)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8f713f7c29b342a52ffd0af818ac7cf3d0000c9a)_is the probability that a random walk on_ _G_ _starting from_ _x_ _will be in_ _y_ _after_ _n_ _steps, and_ _C_ _is some constant._
