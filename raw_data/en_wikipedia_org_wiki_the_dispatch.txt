[ 5 ] Goldberg and Hayes expressed concern over the alliance between conservative media outlets and the Republican Party , and started The Dispatch with a desire to instead focus on conservative principles, regardless of party lines.

[ 6 ] The company is based in downtown Washington, D.C.

[ 5 ] By June 2020, The Dispatch had grown to twelve staffers.

[ 7 ] The Dispatch began with a beta launch in October 2019 and fully launched on January 7, 2020.

[ 1 ] Hayes, Goldberg, and Stock own a majority of the company, but there are additional individual investors.

[ 8 ] The founders intentionally avoided using venture capitalists.

[ 7 ] At its launch in October 2019, The Dispatch had pooled $6 million in investment capital and had in its employ a full-time staff of eight individuals, [ 6 ] including founding editor-in-chief Jonah Goldberg , managing editor Rachael Larimore, and (soon after its launch) senior editor David A. French .

[ 2 ] [ 9 ] In January 2020, shortly after launching, The Dispatch Podcast appeared briefly on Apple's Top 100 news podcasts.

[ 5 ] By March 2020, the company claimed to have nearly 10,000 paying subscribers.

[ 10 ] The Poynter Institute 's International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN) certified The Dispatch ' s fact-checking division in May 2020.

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] As of October 2024, The Dispatch had more than 500,000 subscribers, with more than 40,000 of them paying for the full service.

[ 13 ] The company pulled in nearly $2 million in revenue during its first year, most of which was from Substack subscriptions.

[ 6 ] [ 14 ] The Dispatch was Substack's first media company.

[ 8 ] In October 2022, the publication moved from Substack to its own website.

[ 15 ] The Dispatch has been sharply critical of Donald Trump from a center-right perspective.

[ 2 ] On 6 January 2021, after the 2021 storming of the United States Capitol , Rudy Giuliani left a voicemail message intended for Senator Tommy Tuberville on a different Senator's voicemail account. This message urged Tuberville to delay certification of the electoral vote: "Just try to slow it down." The unnamed Senator gave the message to The Dispatch , which immediately broke the story.

[ 16 ] The next day, The Dispatch published an editorial calling for the impeachment and removal of President Trump.

[ 17 ] In April 2025, Dispatch Media, Inc. acquired the legal publication SCOTUSblog .

[ 4 ] [ 18 ] Content [ edit ] The Dispatch provides free web content, podcasts, and a mix of paid and free newsletters.

[ 5 ] The Dispatch also produces a fact-checking column.

[ 5 ] Newsletters [ edit ] The Morning Dispatch – a morning deep dive into the big political and cultural stories of the day. It is written by Charlotte Lawson, Grayson Logue, and James P. Sutton.

The G-File – Jonah Goldberg's weekly Friday newsletter. There is also a paid Wednesday newsletter, nicknamed the "Hump Day Epistle".

[ 19 ] Boiling Frogs – a daily newsletter written by Nick Catoggio.

[ 20 ] Capitolism – Scott Lincicome's weekly newsletter about federal economic policy.

Wanderland – Kevin D. Williamson's weekly newsletter.

[ 21 ] Dispatch Faith – essays from various faith writers, edited by Michael Reneau.

[ 22 ] Podcasts [ edit ] The Dispatch Podcast – hosted by Sarah Isgur, and co-starring Jonah Goldberg, Stephen Hayes, and Michael Warren. Jamie Weinstein also hosts a weekend interview edition.

[ 23 ] The Remnant – a podcast featuring conversations between Jonah Goldberg and a weekly guest that mixes "history, pop culture, rank-punditry, political philosophy, and, at times, shameless book-plugging".

[ 6 ] [ 24 ] There is also a weekly solo podcast where Goldberg discusses his thoughts on the news of the week, along with explaining his weekly G-file, nicknamed the "Ruminant".

[ 25 ] Advisory Opinions – podcast on law and culture with Sarah Isgur and David French.
