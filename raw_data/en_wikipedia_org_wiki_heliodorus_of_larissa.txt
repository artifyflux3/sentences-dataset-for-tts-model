Biography [ edit ] Nothing is known about the life of Heliodorus.

[ 1 ] He was a native of Larissa , [ 2 ] and he must have lived after the time of Claudius Ptolemy , whom he quotes. His short treatise on optics is little more than a commentary on Euclid .

[ 3 ] It was edited by one Damianus, who was either his son or his pupil.

[ 2 ] The first printed edition, in Greek and Latin, was published in Paris in 1657 with illustrative notes by Erasmus Bartholinus .
