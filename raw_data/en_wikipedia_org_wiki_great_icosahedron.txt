It is composed of 20 intersecting triangular faces, having five triangles meeting at each vertex in a pentagrammic sequence.

The great icosahedron can be constructed analogously to the pentagram, its two-dimensional analogue, via the extension of the ( n –1) -dimensional simplex faces of the core n -polytope (equilateral triangles for the great icosahedron, and line segments for the pentagram) until the figure regains regular faces. The grand 600-cell can be seen as its four-dimensional analogue using the same process.

Construction [ edit ] The edge length of a great icosahedron is 7 + 3 5 2 {\displaystyle {\frac {7+3{\sqrt {5}}}{2}}} times that of the original icosahedron.

Images [ edit ] Transparent model Density Stellation diagram Net A transparent model of the great icosahedron (See also Animation ) It has a density of 7, as shown in this cross-section.

It is a stellation of the icosahedron, counted by Wenninger as model [W41] and the 16th of 17 stellations of the icosahedron and the 7th of 59 stellations by Coxeter .

× 12 Net (surface geometry); twelve isosceles pentagrammic pyramids, arranged like the faces of a dodecahedron. Each pyramid folds up like a fan: the dotted lines fold the opposite direction from the solid lines.

Spherical tiling This polyhedron represents a spherical tiling with a density of 7. (One spherical triangle face is shown above, outlined in blue, filled in yellow) Formulas [ edit ] For a great icosahedron with edge length E (the edge of its dodecahedron core), Inradius = E ( 3 3 − − 15 ) 4 {\displaystyle {\text{Inradius}}={\frac {{\text{E}}(3{\sqrt {3}}-{\sqrt {15}})}{4}}} Midradius = E ( 5 − − 1 ) 4 {\displaystyle {\text{Midradius}}={\frac {{\text{E}}({\sqrt {5}}-1)}{4}}} Circumradius = E 2 ( 5 − − 5 ) 4 {\displaystyle {\text{Circumradius}}={\frac {{\text{E}}{\sqrt {2(5-{\sqrt {5}})}}}{4}}} Surface Area = 3 3 ( 5 + 4 5 ) E 2 {\displaystyle {\text{Surface Area}}=3{\sqrt {3}}(5+4{\sqrt {5}}){\text{E}}^{2}} Volume = 25 + 9 5 4 E 3 {\displaystyle {\text{Volume}}={\tfrac {25+9{\sqrt {5}}}{4}}{\text{E}}^{3}} As a snub [ edit ] The great icosahedron can be constructed as a uniform snub , with different colored faces and only tetrahedral symmetry : . This construction can be called a retrosnub tetrahedron or retrosnub tetratetrahedron , [ 1 ] similar to the snub tetrahedron symmetry of the icosahedron , as a partial faceting of the truncated octahedron (or omnitruncated tetrahedron ): . It can also be constructed with 2 colors of triangles and pyritohedral symmetry as, or , and is called a retrosnub octahedron .

Tetrahedral Pyritohedral Related polyhedra [ edit ] Animated truncation sequence from {5/2, 3} to {3, 5/2} It shares the same vertex arrangement as the regular convex icosahedron . It also shares the same edge arrangement as the small stellated dodecahedron .

A truncation operation, repeatedly applied to the great icosahedron, produces a sequence of uniform polyhedra. Truncating edges down to points produces the great icosidodecahedron as a rectified great icosahedron. The process completes as a birectification, reducing the original faces down to points, and producing the great stellated dodecahedron .

The truncated great stellated dodecahedron is a degenerate polyhedron, with 20 triangular faces from the truncated vertices, and 12 (hidden) doubled up pentagonal faces ({10/2}) as truncations of the original pentagram faces, the latter forming two great dodecahedra inscribed within and sharing the edges of the icosahedron.
