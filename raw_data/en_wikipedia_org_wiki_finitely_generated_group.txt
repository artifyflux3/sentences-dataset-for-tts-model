In algebra , a finitely generated group is a group G that has some finite generating set S so that every element of G can be written as the combination (under the group operation) of finitely many elements of S and of inverses of such elements.

[ 1 ] By definition, every finite group is finitely generated, since S can be taken to be G itself. Every infinite finitely generated group must be countable but countable groups need not be finitely generated. The additive group of rational numbers Q is an example of a countable group that is not finitely generated.

Examples [ edit ] Every quotient of a finitely generated group G is finitely generated; the quotient group is generated by the images of the generators of G under the canonical projection .

A group that is generated by a single element is called cyclic . Every infinite cyclic group is isomorphic to the additive group of the integers Z .

A locally cyclic group is a group in which every finitely generated subgroup is cyclic.

The free group on a finite set is finitely generated by the elements of that set ( §Examples ).

A fortiori , every finitely presented group ( §Examples ) is finitely generated.

Finitely generated abelian groups [ edit ] The six 6th complex roots of unity form a cyclic group under multiplication.

Main article: Finitely generated abelian group Every abelian group can be seen as a module over the ring of integers Z , and in a finitely generated abelian group with generators x 1 , ..., x n , every group element x can be written as a linear combination of these generators, x = α 1 ⋅ x 1 + α 2 ⋅ x 2 + ... + α n ⋅ x n with integers α 1 , ..., α n .

Subgroups of a finitely generated abelian group are themselves finitely generated.

The fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups states that a finitely generated abelian group is the direct sum of a free abelian group of finite rank and a finite abelian group, each of which are unique up to isomorphism.

Subgroups [ edit ] A subgroup of a finitely generated group need not be finitely generated. The commutator subgroup of the free group F 2 {\displaystyle F_{2}} on two generators is an example of a subgroup of a finitely generated group that is not finitely generated.

On the other hand, all subgroups of a finitely generated abelian group are finitely generated.

A subgroup of finite index in a finitely generated group is always finitely generated, and the Schreier index formula gives a bound on the number of generators required.

[ 2 ] In 1954, Albert G. Howson showed that the intersection of two finitely generated subgroups of a free group is again finitely generated. Furthermore, if m {\displaystyle m} and n {\displaystyle n} are the numbers of generators of the two finitely generated subgroups then their intersection is generated by at most 2 m n − − m − − n + 1 {\displaystyle 2mn-m-n+1} generators.

[ 3 ] This upper bound was then significantly improved by Hanna Neumann to 2 ( m − − 1 ) ( n − − 1 ) + 1 {\displaystyle 2(m-1)(n-1)+1} ; see Hanna Neumann conjecture .

The lattice of subgroups of a group satisfies the ascending chain condition if and only if all subgroups of the group are finitely generated. A group such that all its subgroups are finitely generated is called Noetherian .

A group such that every finitely generated subgroup is finite is called locally finite . Every locally finite group is periodic , i.e., every element has finite order .

Conversely , every periodic abelian group is locally finite.

[ 4 ] Applications [ edit ] This section needs expansion . You can help by adding to it .

( September 2017 ) Finitely generated groups arise in diverse mathematical and scientific contexts. A frequent way they do so is by the Švarc-Milnor lemma , or more generally thanks to an action through which a group inherits some finiteness property of a space.

Geometric group theory studies the connections between algebraic properties of finitely generated groups and topological and geometric properties of spaces on which these groups act.

Differential geometry and topology [ edit ] Fundamental groups of compact manifolds are finitely generated. Their geometry coarsely reflects the possible geometries of the manifold: for instance, non-positively curved compact manifolds have CAT(0) fundamental groups, whereas uniformly positively-curved manifolds have finite fundamental group (see Myers' theorem ).

Mostow's rigidity theorem : for compact hyperbolic manifolds of dimension at least 3, an isomorphism between their fundamental groups extends to a Riemannian isometry .

Mapping class groups of surfaces are also important finitely generated groups in low-dimensional topology.

The word problem for a given finitely generated group is solvable if and only if the group can be embedded in every algebraically closed group .

The rank of a group is often defined to be the smallest cardinality of a generating set for the group. By definition, the rank of a finitely generated group is finite.
