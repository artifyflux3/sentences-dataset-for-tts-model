( January 2024 ) Dean Peter Rickles Born July 17, 1977 ( 1977-07-17 ) (age 48) Hull , Yorkshire , England Nationality British Alma mater University of Leeds University of Sheffield Known for Philosophy of quantum gravity and string theory Awards Australian Research Council , Future Fellowship, Australian Research Fellowship, Royal Society (NSW) Medal for HPS Scientific career Fields Philosophy of physics , history of physics Institutions University of Sydney Doctoral advisor Steven French Dean Rickles (born July 17, 1977 [ citation needed ] ) is Professor of History and Philosophy of Modern Physics at the University of Sydney and a Director of the Sydney Centre for Time.

Life [ edit ] Dean Rickles was born in Hull, Yorkshire. He briefly trained as a concert pianist at the London College of Music , before switching to philosophy. He received an MA from the University of Sheffield (1999) and PhD from the University of Leeds (2004). During a two-year postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Calgary in 2005, he worked on the application of complex systems theory to population health.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] He took up a lectureship at the University of Sydney in 2007 and was awarded a five-year Australian Research Council fellowship in 2008 followed by an Australian Research Council Future Fellowship in 2014.

Work [ edit ] Rickles primary focus is on string theory , quantum gravity , and symmetries . His doctoral dissertation, Quantum Gravity in Philosophical Focus (published as a book in 2007 [ 3 ] ), set the foundations for his oft-quoted work within history of string theory [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] and as well as deepening our understanding of the foundations and history of quantum gravity more generally with a series of studies [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] and interviews, [ 11 ] culminating in his book Covered in Deep Mist: The Development of Quantum Gravity, 1916-1956 ( Oxford University Press 2020).

Other philosophical papers include econophysics , [ 12 ] [ 13 ] public health [ 14 ] and musicology , [ 15 ] as well as deeper issues such as the question of Why there is anything at all [ 16 ] In a 2012 collaboration with Huw Price , he developed the John Templeton Foundation project New Agendas for the Study of Time: Connecting the Disciplines .

[ 17 ] Rickles was president of Australian Association for the History, Philosophy, and Social Studies of Science  and
Society (AAHPSSS) during the period 2012–2014. He is also a member of the New York Academy of Sciences and the Foundational Questions Institute . He co-edits the Routledge Studies in the Philosophy of Mathematics and Physics [ 18 ] with Elaine Landry.
