It is the triangle center designated X (111) in Clark Kimberling 's Encyclopedia of Triangle Centers .  The Parry point and Parry circle are named in honour of the English geometer Cyril Parry , who studied them in the early 1990s.

[ 1 ] Parry circle [ edit ] Reference triangle △ ABC Circumcircle of △ ABC Apollonian circles (intersect at the isodynamic points J, K ) Parry circle (through J, K and centroid G ) The Parry circle intersects the circumcircle at two points: the focus of the Kiepert parabola , and the Parry point .

Let △ ABC be a plane triangle. The circle through the centroid and the two isodynamic points of △ ABC is called the Parry circle of △ ABC . The equation of the Parry circle in barycentric coordinates is [ 2 ] 3 ( b 2 − − c 2 ) ( c 2 − − a 2 ) ( a 2 − − b 2 ) ( a 2 y z + b 2 z x + c 2 x y ) + ( x + y + z ) ( ∑ ∑ cyclic b 2 c 2 ( b 2 − − c 2 ) ( b 2 + c 2 − − 2 a 2 ) x ) = 0 {\displaystyle 3(b^{2}-c^{2})(c^{2}-a^{2})(a^{2}-b^{2})(a^{2}yz+b^{2}zx+c^{2}xy)+(x+y+z)\left(\sum _{\text{cyclic}}b^{2}c^{2}(b^{2}-c^{2})(b^{2}+c^{2}-2a^{2})x\right)=0} The center of the Parry circle is also a triangle center. It is the center designated as X (351) in the Encyclopedia of Triangle Centers. The trilinear coordinates of the center of the Parry circle are a ( b 2 − − c 2 ) ( b 2 + c 2 − − 2 a 2 ) : b ( c 2 − − a 2 ) ( c 2 + a 2 − − 2 b 2 ) : c ( a 2 − − b 2 ) ( a 2 + b 2 − − 2 c 2 ) {\displaystyle a(b^{2}-c^{2})(b^{2}+c^{2}-2a^{2}):b(c^{2}-a^{2})(c^{2}+a^{2}-2b^{2}):c(a^{2}-b^{2})(a^{2}+b^{2}-2c^{2})} Parry point [ edit ] The Parry circle and the circumcircle of triangle △ ABC intersect in two points. One of them is the focus of the Kiepert parabola of △ ABC .

[ 3 ] The other point of intersection is called the Parry point of △ ABC .

The trilinear coordinates of the Parry point are a 2 a 2 − − b 2 − − c 2 : b 2 b 2 − − c 2 − − a 2 : c 2 c 2 − − a 2 − − b 2 {\displaystyle {\frac {a}{2a^{2}-b^{2}-c^{2}}}:{\frac {b}{2b^{2}-c^{2}-a^{2}}}:{\frac {c}{2c^{2}-a^{2}-b^{2}}}} The point of intersection of the Parry circle and the circumcircle of △ ABC which is the focus of the Kiepert parabola of △ ABC is  also a triangle center and it is designated as X (110) in Encyclopedia of Triangle Centers . The trilinear coordinates of this triangle center are a b 2 − − c 2 : b c 2 − − a 2 : c a 2 − − b 2 {\displaystyle {\frac {a}{b^{2}-c^{2}}}:{\frac {b}{c^{2}-a^{2}}}:{\frac {c}{a^{2}-b^{2}}}} See also [ edit ] Lester circle References [ edit ] ^ Kimberling, Clark.
