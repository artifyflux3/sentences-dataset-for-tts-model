Diodorus of Tyre ( Ancient Greek : Διόδωρος ) was a Peripatetic philosopher, and a disciple and follower of Critolaus , whom he succeeded as the head of the Peripatetic school at Athens c.

118 BC . He was still alive and active there in 110 BC, when Licinius Crassus , during his quaestorship of Macedonia , visited Athens .

Cicero denies that he was a genuine Peripatetic, because it was one of his ethical maxims, that the greatest good consisted in a combination of virtue with the absence of pain , whereby a reconciliation between the Stoics and Epicureans was attempted.
