The adjective plastic does not refer to the artificial material , but to the formative and sculptural qualities of this ratio, as in plastic arts .

Definition [ edit ] ρ = ⁠ a / b ⁠ = ⁠ b+c / a ⁠ = ⁠ b / c ⁠ . For b = 1 the boxes have volumes ρ 3 = ρ (red) + 1 (green).

Three quantities a > b > c > 0 are in the plastic ratio if b c = a b = b + c a {\displaystyle {\frac {b}{c}}={\frac {a}{b}}={\frac {b+c}{a}}} This ratio is commonly denoted ⁠ ρ ρ .

{\displaystyle \rho .} ⁠ Substituting b = ρ ρ c {\displaystyle b=\rho c\,} and a = ρ ρ b = ρ ρ 2 c {\displaystyle a=\rho b=\rho ^{2}c\,} in the last fraction, ρ ρ = c ( ρ ρ + 1 ) ρ ρ 2 c .

{\displaystyle \rho ={\frac {c(\rho +1)}{\rho ^{2}c}}.} It follows that the plastic ratio is the unique real solution of the cubic equation ρ ρ 3 − − ρ ρ − − 1 = 0.

The plastic ratio ⁠ ρ ρ {\displaystyle \rho } ⁠ and golden ratio ⁠ φ φ {\displaystyle \varphi } ⁠ are the only morphic numbers: real numbers x > 1 for which there exist natural numbers m and n such that ⁠ x + 1 = x m {\displaystyle x+1=x^{m}} ⁠ and ⁠ x − − 1 = x − − n .

{\displaystyle \;x-1=x^{-n}.} ⁠ Morphic numbers can serve as basis for a system of measure.

[ 3 ] Properties of ⁠ ρ ρ {\displaystyle \rho } ⁠ (m=3 and n=4) are related to those of ⁠ φ φ {\displaystyle \varphi } ⁠ (m=2 and n=1). For example, The plastic ratio satisfies the continued radical ρ ρ = 1 + 1 + 1 + ⋯ ⋯ 3 3 3 , {\displaystyle \rho ={\sqrt[{3}]{1+{\sqrt[{3}]{1+{\sqrt[{3}]{1+\cdots }}}}}},} while the golden ratio satisfies the analogous φ φ = 1 + 1 + 1 + ⋯ ⋯ .

{\displaystyle \varphi ={\sqrt {1+{\sqrt {1+{\sqrt {1+\cdots }}}}}}.} The plastic ratio can be expressed in terms of itself as the infinite geometric series ρ ρ = ∑ ∑ n = 0 ∞ ∞ ρ ρ − − 5 n ρ ρ 2 = ∑ ∑ n = 0 ∞ ∞ ρ ρ − − 3 n , {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\rho &=\sum _{n=0}^{\infty }\rho ^{-5n}\\\rho ^{2}&=\sum _{n=0}^{\infty }\rho ^{-3n},\end{aligned}}} in comparison to the golden ratio identity φ φ = ∑ ∑ n = 0 ∞ ∞ φ φ − − 2 n and v i c e v e r s a .

{\displaystyle \varphi =\sum _{n=0}^{\infty }\varphi ^{-2n}{\text{ and }}vice~versa.} Additionally, 1 + φ φ − − 1 + φ φ − − 2 = 2 , {\displaystyle 1+\varphi ^{-1}+\varphi ^{-2}=2,} while ∑ ∑ n = 0 13 ρ ρ − − n = 4.

{\displaystyle \sum _{n=0}^{13}\rho ^{-n}=4.} For every integer ⁠ n {\displaystyle n} ⁠ one has ρ ρ n = ρ ρ n − − 2 + ρ ρ n − − 3 = ρ ρ n − − 1 + ρ ρ n − − 5 = ρ ρ n − − 3 + ρ ρ n − − 4 + ρ ρ n − − 5 {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\rho ^{n}&=\rho ^{n-2}+\rho ^{n-3}\\&=\rho ^{n-1}+\rho ^{n-5}\\&=\rho ^{n-3}+\rho ^{n-4}+\rho ^{n-5}\end{aligned}}} from this an infinite number of further relations can be found.

Van der Laan sequence [ edit ] A fan of plastic Rauzy tiles with areas in ratio Ⴔ. The fractal boundary has box-counting dimension 1.11 In his quest for perceptible clarity, the Dutch Benedictine monk and architect Dom Hans van der Laan (1904-1991) asked for the minimum difference between two sizes, so that we will clearly perceive them as distinct. Also, what is the maximum ratio of two sizes, so that we can still relate them and perceive nearness. According to his observations, the answers are 1/4 and 7/1 , spanning a single order of size .

[ 7 ] Requiring proportional continuity, he constructed a geometric series of eight measures ( types of size ) with common ratio 2 / (3/4 + 1/7 1/7 ) ≈ ρ.

Put in rational form, this architectonic system of measure is constructed from a subset of the numbers that bear his name.

The Van der Laan numbers have a close connection to the Perrin and Padovan sequences . In combinatorics, the number of compositions of n into parts 2 and 3 is counted by the n th Van der Laan number.

The Van der Laan sequence is defined by the third-order recurrence relation V n = V n − − 2 + V n − − 3 for n > 2 , {\displaystyle V_{n}=V_{n-2}+V_{n-3}{\text{ for }}n>2,} with initial values V 1 = 0 , V 0 = V 2 = 1.

This Perrin sequence has the Fermat property : if p is prime, P p ≡ ≡ P 1 mod p .

{\displaystyle P_{p}\equiv P_{1}{\bmod {p}}.} The converse does not hold, but the small number of pseudoprimes n ∣ ∣ P n {\displaystyle \,n\mid P_{n}} makes the sequence special.

Alternatively, ⁠ Q {\displaystyle Q} ⁠ can be interpreted as incidence matrix for a D0L Lindenmayer system on the alphabet ⁠ { a , b , c } {\displaystyle \{a,b,c\}} ⁠ with corresponding substitution rule { a ↦ ↦ b b ↦ ↦ a c c ↦ ↦ a {\displaystyle {\begin{cases}a\;\mapsto \;b\\b\;\mapsto \;ac\\c\;\mapsto \;a\end{cases}}} and initiator ⁠ w 0 = c {\displaystyle w_{0}=c} ⁠ . The series of words ⁠ w n {\displaystyle w_{n}} ⁠ produced by iterating the substitution have the property that the number of c's, b's and a's are equal to successive Van der Laan numbers. Their lengths are l ( w n ) = V n + 2 .

{\displaystyle l(w_{n})=V_{n+2}.} Associated to this string rewriting process is a set composed of three overlapping self-similar tiles called the Rauzy fractal , that visualizes the combinatorial information contained in a multiple-generation letter sequence.

[ 12 ] Geometry [ edit ] Partitioning the square [ edit ] Three partitions of a square into similar rectangles, 1 = 3· ⁠ 1 / 3 ⁠ = ⁠ 2 / 3 ⁠ + 2· ⁠ 1 / 6 ⁠ = ⁠ 1 / ρ 2 ⁠ + ⁠ 1 / ρ 4 ⁠ + ⁠ 1 / ρ 8 ⁠ .

There are precisely three ways of partitioning a square into three similar rectangles: [ 13 ] [ 14 ] The trivial solution given by three congruent rectangles with aspect ratio 3:1.

The solution in which two of the three rectangles are congruent and the third one has twice the side lengths of the other two, where the rectangles have aspect ratio 3:2.

The solution in which the three rectangles are all of different sizes and where they have aspect ratio ρ 2 . The ratios of the linear sizes of the three rectangles are: ρ (large:medium); ρ 2 (medium:small); and ρ 3 (large:small). The internal, long edge of the largest rectangle (the square's fault line) divides two of the square's four edges into two segments each that stand to one another in the ratio ρ.

The internal, coincident short edge of the medium rectangle and long edge of the small rectangle divides one of the square's other, two edges into two segments that stand to one another in the ratio ρ 4 .

The fact that a rectangle of aspect ratio ρ 2 can be used for dissections of a square into similar rectangles is equivalent to an algebraic property of the number ρ 2 related to the Routh–Hurwitz theorem : all of its conjugates have positive real part.

[ 21 ] The initial triangle is positioned at the left-hand side of a parallelogram with base to side ratio ⁠ ρ ρ {\displaystyle \rho } ⁠ and left base angle 60 degrees, so that two edges of the triangle are collinear with sides of the parallelogram. Scaling the parallelogram in ratio ⁠ 1 ρ ρ , {\displaystyle {\tfrac {1}{\rho }},} ⁠ accompanied with a clockwise rotation by 60 degrees, the horizontal base is mapped onto the third edge of the triangle. The centre of rotation is on the short (falling) diagonal, dividing it in ratio ⁠ ρ ρ 3 {\displaystyle \rho ^{3}} ⁠ , the expansion rate for a half-turn.

{\displaystyle \arctan({\tfrac {\sqrt {3}}{1-2\rho }}).} The length of the discrete spiral is ρ ρ 5 = ∑ ∑ n = 0 ∞ ∞ ρ ρ − − n ; {\displaystyle \rho ^{5}=\sum _{n=0}^{\infty }\rho ^{-n};} the pentagon has area 3 4 ρ ρ 3 = 3 4 ∑ ∑ n = 0 ∞ ∞ ρ ρ − − 2 n .

{\displaystyle {\tfrac {\sqrt {3}}{4}}\rho ^{3}={\tfrac {\sqrt {3}}{4}}\sum _{n=0}^{\infty }\rho ^{-2n}.} In the vector image, the construction is repeated on each side of a ⁠ ρ ρ {\displaystyle \rho } ⁠ triangle.

John Rutherford Boyd discovered a related figure, build on the sides of the ⁠ ρ ρ − − 4 {\displaystyle \rho ^{-4}} ⁠ triangle.

[ 22 ] Plastic spiral [ edit ] Two plastic spirals with different initial radii.

Chambered nautilus shell and plastic spiral.

A plastic spiral is a logarithmic spiral that gets wider by a factor of ⁠ ρ ρ {\displaystyle \rho } ⁠ for every quarter turn. It is described by the polar equation r ( θ θ ) = a exp ⁡ ⁡ ( k θ θ ) , {\displaystyle r(\theta )=a\exp(k\theta ),} with initial radius ⁠ a {\displaystyle a} ⁠ and parameter k = 2 π π ln ⁡ ⁡ ( ρ ρ ) .

{\displaystyle k={\frac {2}{\pi }}\ln(\rho ).} If drawn on a rectangle with sides in ratio ⁠ ρ ρ {\displaystyle \rho } ⁠ , the spiral has its pole at the foot of altitude of a triangle on the diagonal and passes through vertices of rectangles with aspect ratio ⁠ ρ ρ 2 {\displaystyle \rho ^{2}} ⁠ which are perpendicularly aligned and successively scaled by a factor ⁠ ρ ρ − − 1 .

{\displaystyle \rho ^{-1}.} ⁠ In 1838 Henry Moseley noticed that whorls of a shell of the chambered nautilus are in geometrical progression: "It will be found that the distance of any two of its whorls measured upon a radius vector is one-third that of the next two whorls measured upon the same radius vector ... The curve is therefore a logarithmic spiral." [ 23 ] Moseley thus gave the expansion rate 3 4 ≈ ≈ ρ ρ − − 1 / 116 {\displaystyle {\sqrt[{4}]{3}}\approx \rho -1/116} for a quarter turn.

[ d ] Considering the plastic ratio a three-dimensional equivalent of the ubiquitous golden ratio, it appears to be a natural candidate for measuring the shell.

[ e ] History and names [ edit ] ρ was first studied by Axel Thue in 1912 and by G. H. Hardy in 1919.

[ 25 ] French high school student Gérard Cordonnier [ fr ] discovered the ratio for himself in 1924. In his correspon­dence with Hans van der Laan a few years later, he called it the radiant number ( French : le nombre radiant ). Van der Laan initially referred to it as the fundamental ratio ( Dutch : de grondverhouding ), using the plastic number ( Dutch : het plastische getal ) from the 1950s onward.

[ 26 ] In 1944 Carl Siegel showed that ρ is the smallest possible Pisot–Vijayaraghavan number and suggested naming it in honour of Thue.

The 1967 St. Benedictusberg Abbey church designed by Hans van der Laan.

Unlike the names of the golden and silver ratios , the word plastic was not intended by van der Laan to refer to a specific substance, but rather in its adjectival sense, meaning something that can be given a three-dimensional shape.

[ 27 ] This, according to Richard Padovan , is because the characteristic ratios of the number, ⁠ 3 / 4 ⁠ and ⁠ 1 / 7 ⁠ , relate to the limits of human perception in relating one physical size to another. Van der Laan designed the 1967 St. Benedictusberg Abbey church to these plastic number proportions.

[ 28 ] The plastic number is also sometimes called the silver number, a name given to it by Midhat J. Gazalé [ 29 ] and subsequently used by Martin Gardner , [ 30 ] but that name is more commonly used for the silver ratio 1 + √ 2 , one of the ratios from the family of metallic means first described by Vera W. de Spinadel . Gardner suggested referring to ρ 2 as "high phi", and Donald Knuth created a special typographic mark for this name, a variant of the Greek letter phi ("φ") with its central circle raised, resembling the Georgian letter pari ("Ⴔ").

^ For a typical 8" nautilus shell the difference in diameter between the apertures of perfect 3 1/4 and ρ −sized specimens is about 1 mm. Allowing for phenotypic plasticity , they may well be indistinguishable.

Resembling φ (φ−1) = 1, Mathworld suggests it is like a "golden ratio for exponentials".

[ 24 ] The interval 3 1/4 < ρ < Ω −1/2 is smaller than 0.012.
