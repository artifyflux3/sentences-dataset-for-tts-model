Riordan earned his doctorate from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1973. He worked at the University of Rochester , then moved to the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and concurrently held an adjunct professorship at the University of California, Santa Cruz .

[ 1 ] While associated with SLAC, Riordan was elected a fellow of the American Physical Society and received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1999.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] The American Institute of Physics honored Riordan with the 2002 Andrew Gemant Award .
