Namely, it bounds the volume of the Minkowski sum of two bodies from above in terms of the volumes of the bodies.

Introduction [ edit ] Let K and L be convex bodies in R n . The Brunn–Minkowski inequality states that v o l ( K + L ) 1 / n ≥ ≥ v o l ( K ) 1 / n + v o l ( L ) 1 / n , {\displaystyle \mathrm {vol} (K+L)^{1/n}\geq \mathrm {vol} (K)^{1/n}+\mathrm {vol} (L)^{1/n}~,} where vol denotes n -dimensional Lebesgue measure and the + on the left-hand side denotes Minkowski addition.

In general, no reverse bound is possible, since one can find convex bodies K and L of unit volume so that the volume of their Minkowski sum is arbitrarily large. Milman's theorem states that one can replace one of the bodies by its image under a properly chosen volume-preserving linear map so that the left-hand side of the Brunn–Minkowski inequality is bounded by a constant multiple of the right-hand side.

The result is one of the main structural theorems in the local theory of Banach spaces .

[ 2 ] Statement of the inequality [ edit ] There is a constant C , independent of n , such that for any two centrally symmetric convex bodies K and L in R n , there are volume-preserving linear maps φ and ψ from R n to itself such that for any real numbers s , t > 0 v o l ( s φ φ K + t ψ ψ L ) 1 / n ≤ ≤ C ( s v o l ( φ φ K ) 1 / n + t v o l ( ψ ψ L ) 1 / n ) .

{\displaystyle \mathrm {vol} (s\,\varphi K+t\,\psi L)^{1/n}\leq C\left(s\,\mathrm {vol} (\varphi K)^{1/n}+t\,\mathrm {vol} (\psi L)^{1/n}\right)~.} One of the maps may be chosen to be the identity.
