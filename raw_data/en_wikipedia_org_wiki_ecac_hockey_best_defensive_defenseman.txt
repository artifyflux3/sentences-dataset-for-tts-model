[ 1 ] The 'Outstanding Defenseman' was first awarded in 1962 but discontinued following the 1967 season. After 25 years of retirement the award was rekindled as the 'Best Defensive Defenseman' in the same year that the Best Defensive Forward was inaugurated (1993). It has since been conferred each year.

Only three players, Mike Traggio , Rob O'Gara and Trey Taylor have won the award more than once. The award has been split twice in its history, 1996–97 and 2013–14 .
