Overview [ edit ] Russia inaugurated the far-Eastern Vostochny Cosmodrome on 28 April 2016 with a traditional Soyuz-2.1a flight, [ 1 ] before expanding it for the Angara rocket family in the following years.  The Chinese Long March 7 flew its maiden flight from the new Wenchang Satellite Launch Center on Hainan Island on 25 June, and the maiden flight of the Long March 5 took place on 3 November. Two years after its 2014 accident , the Antares rocket returned to flight on 17 October with its upgraded 230 version featuring the Russian RD-181 engine.

After many failed attempts , SpaceX began landing its Falcon 9 first stages on autonomous spaceport drone ships , edging closer to their long-stated goal of developing reusable launch vehicles . The company indicated that the recovered engines and structures did not suffer significant damage.

[ 2 ] One of the landed boosters, B1021 , launched in April 2016, was flown again in March 2017; [ 3 ] two others were converted to side boosters for the maiden flight of Falcon Heavy .

[ 4 ] The ExoMars mission, a collaboration between the European and Russian space agencies, was launched on 14 March and reached Mars on 19 October.

[ 5 ] Dedicated to astrobiology investigations, this flight carried the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter , which reached Mars orbit, and the Schiaparelli EDM lander , which crashed upon landing. A subsequent flight scheduled for 2020 will carry the ExoMars Rosalind Franklin rover along with four static surface instruments .

[ 6 ] Meanwhile, the Japanese space probe Akatsuki started its observations of Venus in May [ 7 ] after spending five months gradually adjusting its orbit. 
Planetary exploration activities took center stage with the orbit insertion of NASA's Juno probe at Jupiter on 4 July, followed by the launch of NASA's OSIRIS-REx mission to asteroid 101955 Bennu on 8 September. Finally, on 30 September, the Rosetta probe executed a slow crash-landing on comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko .

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] Human spaceflights included the return of Scott Kelly and Mikhail Kornienko in March after a yearlong mission on the ISS , the longest-ever continuous stay by astronauts at the station. Kelly also set the record for the longest-duration stay of an American in orbit. Four ISS Expeditions numbered 47 to 50 were launched in 2016, the first one using the last Soyuz TMA-M spacecraft and the next three inaugurating the modernized Soyuz MS . Expedition 50 will continue into 2017. Several EVAs were performed to maintain the exterior of the ISS. The experimental BEAM inflatable habitat was attached to the ISS on 16 April and expanded on 28 May to begin two years of on-orbit tests. Meanwhile, China launched its new Tiangong-2 space laboratory in September, which was first visited by two astronauts for a month between 19 October and 17 November.

Falcon 9's first stage performed a soft landing on an autonomous spaceport drone ship in the Pacific Ocean , but the failure of one landing leg to lock into position caused it to fall over and break apart.

The second missile self destroyed "after completing the first phase of the flight", maybe intentional. It appears to be a normal practice in salvo launches. The missile probably carried mockups instead of working upper stages and warheads to save money.

EVA terminated two hours early due to water leakage in Kopra's helmet, but the primary task was accomplished.

[ 103 ] 3 February 12:55 4 hours 45 minutes 17:40 Expedition 46 ISS Pirs Yuri Malenchenko Sergey Volkov Deployed a commemorative flash drive, took samples of module exteriors, installed handrails for use in future EVAs, retrieved an astrobiology experiment, deployed a materials science experiment, and tested a tool for applying coatings to module exteriors.

[ 104 ] 19 August 12:04 5 hours 58 minutes 18:02 Expedition 48 ISS Quest Jeff Williams Kate Rubins The astronauts installed the International Docking Adapter (IDA) which was delivered by Dragon CRS-9 , allowing future commercial crew spacecraft to dock with the station. This first IDA was attached to Harmony 's forward port, over the existing Pressurized Mating Adapter (PMA).

[ 105 ] [ 106 ] The EVA terminated after completing the primary objective, without completing the secondary objectives, due to a malfunction of the right earphone of Jeff Williams.

1 September 11:53 6 hours 48 minutes 18:41 Expedition 48 ISS Quest Jeff Williams Kate Rubins The crew retracted a thermal radiator which is a backup, and then installed the first pair of several high-definition cameras to monitor the traffic around the station. Then they have performed some maintenance operations.

[ 107 ] Space debris events [ edit ] Date/Time (UTC) Source object Event type Pieces tracked Remarks 26 March 01:42 [ 108 ] Hitomi Satellite breakup 10 [ 109 ] JAXA lost communications with the freshly launched telescope during its early commissioning phase. Meanwhile, JspOC observed 5 then 10 pieces of debris diverging from the satellite, one of them comparably sized to the main spacecraft by radar signature.

[ 110 ] Hitomi itself went into a tumble and sent short intermittent communications. The tumble was caused by a failure of the inertial reference unit mistakenly reporting the spacecraft to be spinning. As the attitude control system attempted to correct the non-existent spin, the unnecessary correction itself is believed to have caused the subsuqent failures, ultimately leading to the loss of the spacecraft, 28 April.

[ 111 ] [ 112 ] [ 23 ] In a twist of fate, one of the secondary payloads traveling with Hitomi was ChubuSat-3 , a microsatellite dedicated to monitoring global warming effects and space debris.

[ 113 ] 1 June 09:20 [ 114 ] SL-12 R/B (#33473) Booster breakup 20+ [ 114 ] An ullage motor , part of a Russian Proton-M rocket that was launched in December 2008, exploded for unknown reasons.

[ 115 ] Orbital launch statistics [ edit ] By country [ edit ] For the purposes of this section, the yearly tally of orbital launches by country assigns each flight to the country of origin of the rocket, not to the launch services provider or the spaceport. For example, Soyuz launches by Arianespace in Kourou are counted under Russia because Soyuz-2 is a Russian rocket.
