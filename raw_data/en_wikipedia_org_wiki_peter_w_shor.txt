He has been a professor of applied mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) since 2003.

Early life and education [ edit ] Shor was born on August 14, 1959, in New York City , to Joan Bopp Shor and S. W. Williston Shor.

[ 10 ] [ 11 ] He grew up in Washington, D.C.

and Mill Valley, California .

[ 10 ] While attending Tamalpais High School , he placed third in the 1977 USA Mathematical Olympiad .

[ 12 ] After graduation that year, he won a silver medal at the International Math Olympiad in Yugoslavia (the U.S. team achieved the most points per country that year).

[ 13 ] [ 14 ] Shor graduated from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in 1981 with a B.S.

in mathematics.

[ 15 ] He was a Putnam Fellow in 1978. He then did doctoral study in applied mathematics at MIT, receiving a Ph.D. in 1985.

[ 16 ] His doctoral advisor was F. Thomson Leighton , and his thesis was on probabilistic analysis of bin-packing algorithms.

Career [ edit ] After being awarded his PhD by MIT, he spent one year as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Berkeley , and then accepted a position at Bell Labs in New Providence, New Jersey . It was there he developed Shor's algorithm . This development was inspired by Simon's problem . Shor first found an efficient quantum algorithm for the discrete log problem (which relates point-finding on a hypercube to a torus) and, "Later that week, I was able to solve the factoring problem as well. There’s a strange relation between discrete log and factoring." [ 17 ] Both of these problems are examples of the HSP . For his work discovering the efficient quantum algorithms for factoring and discrete logarithm  he was awarded the Nevanlinna Prize at the 23rd International Congress of Mathematicians in 1998 [ 18 ] [ 19 ] and the Gödel Prize in 1999.

[ 20 ] In 1999, he was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship .

[ 21 ] In 2017, he received the Dirac Medal of the ICTP and for 2019 the BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in Basic Sciences.

[ 22 ] Shor began his MIT position in 2003. Currently, he is the Henry Adams Morss and Henry Adams Morss, Jr. Professor of Applied Mathematics in the Department of Mathematics at MIT.

[ 23 ] He also is affiliated with CSAIL .

[ 24 ] He received a Distinguished Alumni Award from Caltech in 2007.

[ 15 ] On October 1, 2011, he was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences .

[ 25 ] [ 26 ] He was elected as an ACM Fellow in 2019 "for contributions to quantum-computing, information theory, and randomized algorithms".

[ 27 ] He was elected as a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 2002.

[ 28 ] In 2020, he was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering for pioneering contributions to quantum computation.

[ 29 ] In an interview published in Nature on October 30, 2020, Shor said that he considers post-quantum cryptography to be a solution to the quantum threat, although a lot of engineering effort is required to switch from vulnerable algorithms.

[ 30 ] Along with three others, Shor was awarded the 2023 Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics for "foundational work in the field of quantum information."
