**David William Harvey**[FBA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fellow_of_the_British_Academy "Fellow of the British Academy") (born 31 October 1935) is a British-American academic best known for Marxist analyses that focus on [urban geography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_geography "Urban geography") as well as the economy more broadly. He is a [Distinguished Professor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distinguished_Professor "Distinguished Professor") of [anthropology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropology "Anthropology") and geography at the [Graduate Center of the City University of New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduate_Center_of_the_City_University_of_New_York "Graduate Center of the City University of New York") ([CUNY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUNY "CUNY")). Harvey has authored many books and essays that have been prominent in the development of modern geography as a [discipline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_discipline "Academic discipline"). He is a proponent of the idea of the [right to the city](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_the_city "Right to the city").

In 2007, Harvey was listed as the 18th most-cited author of books in the humanities and social sciences in that year, as established by counting citations from academic journals in the [Thomson Reuters ISI database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomson_Reuters_ISI_database "Thomson Reuters ISI database").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Harvey#cite_note-2)

Early life and education
------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=David_Harvey&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Early life and education")]

David Harvey lecturing a class

David W. Harvey was born in 1935 in [Gillingham, Kent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gillingham,_Kent "Gillingham, Kent").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Harvey#cite_note-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Harvey#cite_note-4) He attended [Gillingham Grammar School for Boys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Howard_School,_Kent "The Howard School, Kent") and [St John's College, Cambridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_John%27s_College,_Cambridge "St John's College, Cambridge"), for both his undergraduate and post-graduate studies. Harvey's early work, beginning with his PhD (on hops production in 19th century Kent), was historical in nature, emerging from a regional-historical tradition of inquiry widely used at Cambridge and in Britain at that time. Historical inquiry runs through his later works (for example on Paris).[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Harvey#cite_note-5)

[![Image 2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/David_Harvey_on_Subversive_Festival.jpg/250px-David_Harvey_on_Subversive_Festival.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:David_Harvey_on_Subversive_Festival.jpg)

David Harvey at [Subversive Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subversive_Festival "Subversive Festival")

By the mid-1960s, Harvey followed trends in the social sciences to employ quantitative methods, contributing to spatial science and [positivist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positivism "Positivism") theory. Roots of this work were visible while he was at Cambridge: the [Department of Geography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Geography,_University_of_Cambridge "Department of Geography, University of Cambridge") also housed [Richard Chorley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Chorley "Richard Chorley"), and [Peter Haggett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Haggett "Peter Haggett"). His _Explanation in Geography_ (1969) was a landmark text in the methodology and philosophy of geography, applying principles drawn from the philosophy of science in general to the field of geographical knowledge. But after its publication Harvey moved on again, to become concerned with issues of [social injustice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_inequality "Social inequality") and the nature of the capitalist system itself. He has never returned to embrace the arguments made in _Explanation_, but still he conforms to the critique of absolute space and exceptionalism in geography of the regional-historical tradition that he saw as an outcome of [Kantian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kant "Kant")_synthetic [a priori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A\_priori\_and\_a\_posteriori "A priori and a posteriori")_ knowledge.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

### 1970s Growth of Marxist geography and urban geography

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=David_Harvey&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: 1970s Growth of Marxist geography and urban geography")]

Moving from [Bristol University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_University "Bristol University") to [Johns Hopkins University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johns_Hopkins_University "Johns Hopkins University") in [Baltimore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore "Baltimore") in the United States, he positioned himself centrally in the newly emerging field of radical and [Marxist geography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxist_geography "Marxist geography"). [Injustice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_injustice "Social injustice"), racism, and [exploitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploitation_of_labour "Exploitation of labour") were visible in Baltimore, and activism around these issues was tangible in the early 1970s US [East Coast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeastern_United_States "Northeastern United States"), perhaps more so than in Britain. The journal _[Antipode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipode\_(journal) "Antipode (journal)")_ was formed at [Clark University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_University "Clark University"); Harvey was one of the first contributors. The Boston [Association of American Geographers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_American_Geographers "Association of American Geographers") meetings in 1971 were a landmark, with Harvey and others disrupting the traditional approach of their peers.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Harvey#cite_note-6) In 1972, in an essay on ghetto formation, he argued for the creation of "revolutionary theory", theory "validated through revolutionary practice".[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Harvey#cite_note-7)

#### _Social Justice and the City_ (1973)

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=David_Harvey&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Social Justice and the City (1973)")]

One of the most important subfields impacted by the rise of Marxist geography was in [urban geography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_geography "Urban geography"). Harvey established himself as the leader of this subfield with the publication of _[Social Justice and the City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social\_Justice\_and\_the\_City "Social Justice and the City")_ (1973). Harvey argued in this book that geography could not remain 'objective' in the face of urban poverty and associated ills.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Harvey#cite_note-8) It makes a contribution to Marxist theory by arguing that capitalism annihilates space to ensure its own [reproduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_reproduction "Social reproduction").

### 1980s consolidation of Marxist geography and materialist critique of postmodernism

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=David_Harvey&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: 1980s consolidation of Marxist geography and materialist critique of postmodernism")]

[Dialectical materialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism "Dialectical materialism") has guided his subsequent work, notably the _Limits to Capital_ (1982), which furthers the radical geographical analysis of capitalism, and several books on urban processes and urban life have followed it. In 'Limits to Capital' Harvey expanded and innovated Marxist theory with respect to the functioning of money and finance, and the 'spatial moment' in the unfolding of capitalist crisis formation.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Harvey#cite_note-9)_The Condition of Postmodernity_ (1989), written while a professor at [Oxford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Oxford "University of Oxford"), was a best-seller (the London _[The Independent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Independent "The Independent")_ named it as one of the fifty most important works of non-fiction to be published since 1945, and it is cited 50,000 times by 2023). It is a materialist critique of [postmodern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmodernism "Postmodernism") ideas and arguments, suggesting these actually emerge from contradictions within capitalism itself. _Justice, Nature and the Geography of Difference_ (1996) focuses on [social](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_justice "Social justice") and [environmental justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_justice "Environmental justice") (although its dialectical perspective has attracted the ire of some Greens.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]). _[Spaces of Hope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaces\_of\_Hope "Spaces of Hope")_ (2000) has a utopian theme and indulges in speculative thinking about how an alternative world might look.

His study of Second Empire Paris and the events surrounding the [Paris Commune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Commune "Paris Commune") in _Paris, Capital of Modernity_, is his most elaborated historical-geographical work. The onset of US military action since 2001 has provoked a critique â€“ in _The New Imperialism_ (2003) he argues that the war in Iraq allows US neo-conservatives to divert attention from the failures of capitalism 'at home'. His next work, _A Brief History of Neoliberalism_ (2005), provides an historical examination of the theory and divergent practices of neoliberalism since the mid-1970s. This work conceptualises the neoliberalised global [political economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_economy "Political economy") as a system that benefits few at the expense of many, and which has resulted in the (re)creation of class distinction through what Harvey calls "[accumulation by dispossession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accumulation_by_dispossession "Accumulation by dispossession")". His book _The Enigma of Capital_ (2010) takes a long view of the contemporary economic crisis. Harvey explains how capitalism came to dominate the world and why it resulted in the [2008 financial crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_financial_crisis "2008 financial crisis"). He describes that the essence of capitalism is its amorality and lawlessness and to talk of a [regulated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capitalism "Regulatory capitalism"), ethical capitalism is to make a fundamental error.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Harvey#cite_note-10) A series of events linked to this book across London academic forums, such as the LSE, proved popular[_[quantify](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual\_of\_Style/Dates\_and\_numbers "Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers")_] and sparked a new interest in Harvey's work.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

Harvey returned to Johns Hopkins from [Oxford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Oxford "University of Oxford") in 1993, but spent increasing time elsewhere as a speaker and visitor, notably as a Miliband Fellow at the [London School of Economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_School_of_Economics "London School of Economics") in the late 1990s. In 1996, he delivered the [Ellen Churchill Semple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_Churchill_Semple "Ellen Churchill Semple") lecture at the [Department of Geography, University of Kentucky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Geography,_University_of_Kentucky "Department of Geography, University of Kentucky").[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Harvey#cite_note-11) He moved to the [City University of New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_University_of_New_York "City University of New York") in 2001 as a Distinguished Professor, now residing in its Department of Anthropology. He has spent most of his academic career in Anglo-America, with brief sojourns in France and a range of foreign visiting appointments (currently as acting Advisory Professor at [Tongji University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongji_University "Tongji University") in Shanghai). He has supervised many PhD students. Several of these, such as [Neil Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Smith_(geographer) "Neil Smith (geographer)"), Richard Walker, [Erik Swyngedouw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Swyngedouw "Erik Swyngedouw"), Michael Johns, [Maarten Hajer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maarten_Hajer "Maarten Hajer"), [Patrick Bond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Bond "Patrick Bond"), Melissa Wright, and Greg Ruiters now hold or held important academic positions themselves.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]. In 2013 Harvey was asked by the [Republic of Ecuador](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecuador "Ecuador") to help set up the National Strategic Center for the Right to the Territory (CENEDET),[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Harvey#cite_note-12) which he directed with the urbanist [Miguel Robles-DurÃ¡n](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miguel_Robles-Dur%C3%A1n "Miguel Robles-DurÃ¡n") until its alleged forced closure in 2017.

Critical response to Harvey's work has been sustained. In the early years, there was competition between Harvey and proponents of quantitative and non-politicized geography, notably [Brian Berry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Berry "Brian Berry"). A recent critical appraisal (Castree &[Gregory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_Gregory "Derek Gregory"), 2006) explores some critiques of Harvey in detail.

### Reading Marx's _Capital_

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=David_Harvey&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Reading Marx's Capital")]

Two constants in Harvey's life and work have been teaching a course on Marx's _[Capital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital\_(book) "Capital (book)")_[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Harvey#cite_note-13) and his support for student activism and community and labour movements (notably in Baltimore). His course was put into a YouTube lecture series,[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Harvey#cite_note-14)[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Harvey#cite_note-15) which gained immense popularity and resulted in two companion books covering the three volumes of Marx's _Capital_.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Harvey#cite_note-16)

David Harvey is widely recognised as a foundational scholar in [urban geography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_geography "Urban geography").[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Harvey#cite_note-17) Harvey's books have been widely translated. He holds honorary doctorates from Roskilde (Denmark), Buenos Aires (Argentina), the Faculty of Social Sciences at [Uppsala University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uppsala_University "Uppsala University")[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Harvey#cite_note-18) (Sweden), [Ohio State University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_State_University "Ohio State University") (USA), [Lund University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lund_University "Lund University") (Sweden), the [University of the Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_the_Republic_(Uruguay) "University of the Republic (Uruguay)")[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Harvey#cite_note-19) (Uruguay) and the [University of Kent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Kent "University of Kent") (UK). Among other awards he has received the Anders Retzius Gold Medal of the [Swedish Society for Anthropology and Geography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_Society_for_Anthropology_and_Geography "Swedish Society for Anthropology and Geography"), the [Patron's Medal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patron%27s_Medal "Patron's Medal") of the [Royal Geographical Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Geographical_Society "Royal Geographical Society") and the [Vautrin Lud International Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laur%C3%A9at_Prix_International_de_G%C3%A9ographie_Vautrin_Lud "LaurÃ©at Prix International de GÃ©ographie Vautrin Lud") in Geography (France). He was made a fellow of the [British Academy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Academy "British Academy") in 1998, and was elected to the [American Academy of Arts and Sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Academy_of_Arts_and_Sciences "American Academy of Arts and Sciences") in 2007. He is a member of the Interim Committee for the emerging International Organization for a Participatory Society.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Harvey#cite_note-20)

Harvey resides in New York. He has a daughter, Delfina, born in January 1990.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Harvey#cite_note-21)
