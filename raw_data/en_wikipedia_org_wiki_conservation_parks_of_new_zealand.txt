[ 1 ] The status is established under the Conservation Act 1987 and the parks are administered by the Department of Conservation (DoC).

As of September 2020 [update] , there were 54 conservation parks in New Zealand (including 36 forest parks), covering an area of 2,690,191 hectares.

[ 2 ] Forest parks [ edit ] Forest parks have a less stringent level of protection than national parks and are used for a wide variety of recreational and commercial activities.

[ 3 ] Some forest parks have recently been renamed conservation parks, for instance, the former 'Whirinaki Forest Park' which became the Whirinaki Te Pua-a-Tāne Conservation Park in 2010.
