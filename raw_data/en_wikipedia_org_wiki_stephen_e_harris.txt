Harris Stephen Harris Born ( 1936-11-29 ) November 29, 1936 (age 88) Brooklyn , New York Nationality American Alma mater Stanford University Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Scientific career Fields Physics Institutions Stanford University Doctoral advisor Anthony E. Siegman Doctoral students Robert L. Byer , Ataç İmamoğlu , Richard Miles Stephen Ernest Harris (born November 29, 1936) is an American physicist known for his contributions to electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), [ 1 ] [ 2 ] modulation of single photons, and x-ray emission.

In a diverse career, he has collaborated with others to produce results in many areas, including the 1999 paper titled “Light speed reduction to 17 metres per second in an ultracold gas,” [ 3 ] in which Lene Hau and Harris, Cyrus Behroozi and Zachary Dutton describe how they used EIT to slow optical pulses to the speed of a bicycle.  He has also contributed to developments in the use of the laser , generating paired photons with single driving lasers [ 4 ] He has also shown the development of such pairs of photons using waveforms .

[ 5 ] His more recent work has sought to address restraints imposed on the types of waveforms that can be produced by the single-cycle barrier [ 6 ] Harris and colleagues succeeded in this endeavour in 2005 during a series of experiments aimed at obtaining full control of waveforms, noting "we were able to vary the shape of the pulse to generate different prescribed waveforms." [ 7 ] It is hoped that these results will lead to coherent control of chemical reactions, as a probe for ever-shorter physical processes, and for highly efficient generation of far infra-red and vacuum ultra-violet radiation.

Harris was elected as a member into the National Academy of Engineering in 1977 for contributions in the field of coherent and non-linear optics.
