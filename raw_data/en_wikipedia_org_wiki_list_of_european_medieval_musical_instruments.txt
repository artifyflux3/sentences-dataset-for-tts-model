[ 7 ] As Christianity became widespread, trumpets, semantrons and bells were used in religious services, including calling worshippers to service.

[ 8 ] Paulinus of Nola (about 400 A.D.) and Pope Sabinianus (about 604 A.D.) are credited for early use of bells in church.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] Monks in Byzantine cloisters in Damascus cast some of Christianity's earliest bells (about handbell sized).

[ 7 ] These were used to broadcast time inside the cloisters.

[ 7 ] Small cast bells in "Mediterranean tradition" were used by Christians during the first four centuries A.D.

[ 11 ] In the 5th century Irish Christians made forged bells of sheet metal, and one was carried by Saint Patrick for use as a church bell.

[ 11 ] By St. Columba 's day (521-597 A.D.), both riveted sheet-metal bells of iron and quadrangular cast-bronze bells were in use.

[ 12 ] The bells were wrung in the Celtic Christian Church , whose missionary work brought Christianity to parts of Europe conquered by Germanic tribes in the fall of the Roman Empire.

[ 12 ] [ 13 ] The bells in Ireland are culturally linked to those in Scotland, Wales, England, Brittany, France, and Switzerland.

[ 12 ] Based on number of known bells, Ireland may be source of the region's sheet-metal bell type.

[ 12 ] In 530 A.D., the Benedictine Order began to engineer cast churchbells and set up foundries to make them, supplying them throughout western Europe.

Bumbulum (legendary) Bunibulum (legendary) Some medieval scribes theorized about music from the past, or used musical instruments to illustrate doctrinal points. They copied in manuscript a letter from St. Jerome (342-420 A.D.) to Claudius Postumus Dardanus . In it, Jerome tried to explain pagan and Christian musical instruments that are mentioned in the Bible and their allegorical meanings.

[ 23 ] The letter was reproduced in Christian manuscripts. Starting about 850, scribes began to illustrate the letter in manuscripts, from descriptions of the musical instruments in the letter.

[ 24 ] Some are allegorical and wouldn't work, such as a horn with three mouthpieces for each of the Holy Trinity to blow through; however in an allegory the Trinity would be expressed by speaking through the four outlets, symbolizing the Four Evangelists .

The bumbulum was played by shaking it. It had hanging bells or jingles, suspended from a centerpiece, itself suspended from overhead. It was described as a carpenter's square (signifiying the Holy Cross) with a "four cornered object" hanging from it (signifying Christ on the Cross), with 12 pipes hanging from the object's sides (to jingle and to signify the 12 Apostles).

Clappers crotalum cliquettes castagnettes Crotala, from the Carolingian Empire were metal chimes attached to sticks. Cliquettes (also called crotala)  were blocks of wood held in the palms. The palm-held blocks could make clicking and rattle noises like castanets. Other similar instruments worldwide include  the Thai/Cambodian krap sepha , Indian/Nepali khartal , Uzbek / Tajik qairaq , or North African krakebs . Castagnettes were wooden instrument, made up of sticks that were clapped or beaten together.

Cymbals Cymbala Carillon Greek word kymbolon transmitted to medieval Europe through Latin ( cymbalum -singular, cymbala -plural). Examples in Roman and Byzantine mosaics show girls dancing with them, in different versions that include finger or palm cymbals , cymbals on sticks and cup-shaped cymbals .

The cymbals on sticks (crotala) found their way into art of the Carolingian Empire . In medieval manuscripts, cymbala became bell chimes, bells suspended in series and struck with hammers. Cup shaped cymbals also made their way into medieval manuscripts. Unlike the dancing artwork from Roman and Byzantine mosaics, the Carolingian and later artwork was stripped of sexuality and put into a Christian or Jewish context.

5th century A.D., Roman villa at Agora, Argos, Greece. A dancer in the thiasus plays cymbala and dances with Dionysus.

The frame drum in use in Europe before the bigger drums arrived from West Asia can be called tambourines today.

Tympanum was used as a name, as well as tabor . These were wooden rings with leather covering one side. At first there were no jingles, as became common. A variant was the pandeiro , introduced with Muslim invasions and pictured in manuscripts in Spain and Sicily. Some tabors could be frame drums, but other grew wider than the hand-held ring which we call tambourine today.

Tof was the Hebrew instrument which Miriam played, "most commonly translated" into English as timbrel [ 29 ] Near eastern origin, used by Gauls, Greeks, Romans ( tympanum ), Egyptians, Assyrians.

[ 30 ] Jingles were probably originally separate from this instrument.

[ 30 ] Also related to Daff .

[ 30 ] When jingles are attached, the instrument is classified as a type of rattle, a "frame wrattle," in which the rattles (or jingles) strike the object to which they are attached.

A timbrel or Basque tamborello was a "single-skin frame drum with cymbals" (modern tambourine ), while a "single-skin frame drum" without jingles could also be labeled tamburin or bendir .

[ 26 ] The bendir is also a Muslim frame drum with two snares from North Africa, whose name "probably derives from a Spanish word." [ 31 ] Tympanum , Latin Tympanon , Greek Tof Timbrel [ 32 ] [ 26 ] Tambourine [ 26 ] Bendir [ 26 ] Basque tamborello [ 26 ] 3rd century A.D., Tunisia (Roman Empire).

Organistrum (large form of medieval hurdy-gurdy ) Symphonia Hurdy-gurdy Organistrum, an early form of hurdy-gurdy, probable ancestor of later hurdy-gurdies.

[ 83 ] Played in churches and monastic schools until the 13th century A.D.

[ 84 ] After 13th century the instrument declined, and fell into disuse in the 14th.

[ 84 ] Outside of the church it was used for popular music and folk music, and later by beggars.

[ 84 ] Initially a fiddle shaped instrument with a hand crank, which turned a wheel.

[ 84 ] The wheel rubbed against all the strings at once making them sound.

[ 84 ] Strings were sounded simultaneously, with outer strings acting as drones and center strings (which the keys activated) used for melody.

[ 84 ] At first it was played by two individuals: one turned the crank while the other worked "key rods" to change the musical pitch of the strings.

[ 84 ] As the instrument became a smaller, one-person instrument, key rods became "push levers".

[ 84 ] The new mechanism required that the instrument be tilted as it was played.

[ 84 ] [ 85 ] In the 10th century A.D., Odo of Cluny wrote a work ( Quomodo organistrum construatur ) that helped readers make an instrument.

Rabel at the Ethnographic Museum of Cantabria Rebab Rabé morisco In the late 8th century A.D.

r-bab ( rabāb ) was used in Arabic for a plucked boat-shaped lute.

[ 89 ] The name would also be used for bowed spike lutes by the 900s A.D., mentioned by Al Farabi.

[ 89 ] The boat-shaped lute would become bowed as well, used in northern Africa as the Maghreb rebab and in Andalusia, becoming the rebec.

[ 89 ] Cytharas in early copies of Commentary on the Apocalypse were plucked lutes; these lutes were later shown bowed.

[ 89 ] Bowed instruments entered Europe from the Islamic world in "Moorish Spain and Byzantium.

[ 89 ] Rebab is a word for various kinds of fiddle in the Muslim world. Spelling is loose, because Arabic does not write down vowels sounds. Rabab, rebab, rubab, ribab have all been used, and some of them are used for plucked instruments in Asia as well.

Bowed instrument resembling Maghreb rebabs. Spanish and Catalonian names for this include Rebac and Rabel (both are instruments played on the arm, rather than the knee), but its shape closely resembles these.

circa 1437. Angel performing for Mary, Queen of Heaven playing a rebab. Panel of the Altarpiece of Santa María la Mayor of Albalate del Arzobispo (province of Teruel). It is preserved in the Museum of Zaragoza.

Instrument seen only in Cantigas de Santa Maria. Resembles guitarra but is played vertically like a rebab or a later viol ( viola de gamba or vihuela de gamba). Unlike these, it is shown played vertically while standing. Also resembles gusle .

Rebec [ 90 ] Western European version of the lyra.

Europeans adapted the Near Eastern rabāb to Western music.

[ 91 ] The Byzantines called their version Lyra (harkening to Greek musical instruments), while in Spain northward the rabāb became rebab , rebec , rabel , rubebe . Eastward from the Byzantine empire, it became lirica (among Croats), gudok (Russia), gusla and gadulka (Bulgaria).

[ 91 ] Rabāb was glossed as Lyra in the 11th century.

[ 91 ] Where rebec and rubebe were used, rubebe disappeared from use after the mid-1400s.

[ 92 ] One version had two strings, tuned a fifth apart.

[ 91 ] Another had a wooden body with five strings, "identical to the rabāb of the Arabs." [ 91 ] A version with three strings tuned in fifths and lateral pegs became the typical instrument used into the Renaissance.

Rotte The name rotte was used for lyres first; the name began to be applied to a harp-like psaltery about the 12th century A.D.

[ 93 ] Often confused with harps in illustrations. Church writers in the Carolingian Empire had limited understanding of earlier instruments, such as the angular vertical harp . Descriptions from the 4th-5th centuries of this instrument caused confusion in the 10th-12th centuries by artists creating minatures in manuscripts.

Vihuela Viola In the Iberian Peninsula, small lutes are pictured, which have been considered as possible cytharas and citoles . In Portugal, the tradition remained into the modern era, the instruments called violas . They were vihuelas in Spain. Vihuela eventually became a large guitar-like instrument of the Renaissance. Violas remained small. The name viola has been reused for a variety of instruments including viola da gamba , viola (a modern fiddle).

Possibly the vihuela de arco (bowed vihuela) and vihuela de penola (quill plucked vihuela) The bowed instrument could be called a vielle Vihuela de arco (bowed vihuela). The downward bowed fiddles came to be called Viols, as in Viola de gamba (viol of the legs). Vihuela was the Spanish name, and in Spain the vihuelas became plucked more than bowed.

Buisine Anafil Nafir Trompe See horn and wooden trumpet below.

The nafir was a Muslim instrument, adapted by Europeans and renamed the anafil in Spain [ 105 ] and the buisine in France.ú [ 106 ] ú The buisine (first mention about 1100 A.D.) was a long, slightly curved horn, used in battle for signaling.

[ 106 ] It was replaced by the nafir, the name transferred to the new instrument.

[ 106 ] The new buisine was of brass, copper or silver, 4-7 feet long, made in sections that could be assembled with "bosses" covering the joints.

[ 106 ] In 12th century trompe in French (also Catalan, Spanish and Portuguese variants) is recorded for an instrument that is "long and straight." Used in battles as a signal horn, in tournaments and weddings for atmosphere. By the 17th century the trompe had a single coil.

[ 107 ] Europeans developed the instrument further into the herald trumpet or clarion near the end of the medieval period.

Initially in Spain (during the Reconquista ), and France and other parts of Europe during the Crusades .

Circa 800-850 A.D., Carolingian Empire , Stuttgarter Psalter. Before applying to Saracen instruments, buisine applied to long horns and trumpets.

Clarion Claretta Fanfare trumpet Herald trumpet Bugle Clarion today implies high, angelic, pealing notes. That sound was developed, however, as Europeans began to learn to shape and bend sheet-metal tubes for trumpets. Muslims also had trumpets with clarion notes, as part of a mix of trumpet sounds with tenor and bass.

[ 105 ] Horns would change too, becoming metal instruments such as the bugle (Old English word for ox).

Clarion eventually became a range of notes, within the reach of natural trumpets and bugles. The later medieval and Renaissance cornetts (fingerhole horns) would also come to hit clarion notes.

Cornett "Proto-cornetts" [ 109 ] Fingerhole trumpets Fingerhole horns See horn , shepherd's horn and wooden trumpet below Best known as a Renaissance instrument (1500s-1600s), cornetts were wooden fingerhole trumpets whose blowhole was so small it required the instrument be played at the side of the mouth. The cornett was likely derived from an animal horn pierced with fingerholes such as the coradoiz.

[ 110 ] Later cornetts took on a stylized appearance, the curved instruments somewhat resembling an animal horn.  Carved wooden instruments had octagon exterior by the 12th century.

[ 110 ] In artwork, it may be difficult to know whether an instrument is lip-blown (a trumpet) or a reedpipe (sounded by a reed inserted into the tip, held in the player's mouth).

Angel with crumhorn, detail of Presentation of Jesus in the Temple by Vittore Carpaccio (1465–1526) Flageolet Originally a "whistle flute" or duct flute from Asia.

[ 112 ] Used in medieval Europe by the 11th century A.D.

[ 112 ] In Europe it was a flute of the countryside, made of willow ( see willow flute below ) as late as the mid-13th century.

[ 113 ] It was also made of cane or wood (and in one example, copper) with a fipple at the top, which musicians blew through to produce sound.

[ 112 ] Later version in 1581 would have 4 fingerholes and 2 thumbholes.

[ 112 ] [ 113 ] It was characterized in 1640 as being shorter than the recorder.

[ 112 ] One possible version of the instrument was a short four-holed duct flute (Russpfeif), illustrated in 1511 by Virdung.

[ 114 ] The flaviol was a flageolet of the Pyrenees, about 6 inches long with one fingerhole and played with one hand with the drum or tabor.

[ 115 ] Some flaviols may have 3 fingerholes and two vents, one thumbhole and two vents.

[ 115 ] Another, played one-handed with tabor, had a single fingerhole.

Flute Flutes in medieval Europe included the transverse flute and the duct flute. The transverse flute was held horizontally below the musician's head, allowing them to blow air into the top side of the instrument (across the hole's sharp edge).

Flutes had been known in Europe in prehistoric times but disappeared. The transverse flute had also been seen in Europe as early as the 2nd century B.C. ( recorded in Etruscan artwork from a tomb in Perugia ).

[ 117 ] [ 118 ] It also made an appearance on a coin from Syria, circa 169 A.D.

[ 117 ] These are the only early examples currently known.

[ 117 ] The transverse flute which arrived in medieval Europe developed in Asia, where separate traditions existed in India and China.

[ 117 ] It entered Europe through Byzantium (by way of "North Africa, Hungary, and Bohemia") and Germany.

[ 119 ] [ 117 ] Curt Sachs saw examples of it in Greek art as early as the 10th century, and said it had been written about "as plágioi about 800 A.D." [ 117 ] Other researchers note the 11th century as the beginning of depictions in European artwork.

[ 119 ] Transverse flutes became popular in Germany and were known as German flutes as the instruments' use spread.

[ 117 ] In the early 20th century, it was noted that the countries of Romania, Yugoslavia, Hungary, Bohemia, Austria and Switzerland held a  "predilection" for the transverse flute in the folk music.

Duct flute fipple flute Duct flute with tapering bore, seen in French art in 11th century A.D., traceable back from modern times into the 12th century.

[ 120 ] Called the recorde in England by about 1400.

[ 120 ] In 1400s multiple sizes existed. By 1511, sizes included bass, tenor, alto and soprano instruments.

[ 120 ] Recorders are fairly rare in medieval art, the pipe (for pipe and tabor) being more common. Possibly began main start in European music in Northern Italy in the 14th century, and was established at the beginning of the 16th century.

[ 121 ] It is difficult to tell from art if a recorder is presented (with a thumb hole) or a "some kind of folk pipe (without the thumb hole)." [ 121 ] In comparison, reed pipes had a very limited range of notes (having only 3-4 holes and being played with one hand). Recorders and pipes with the holes requiring two hands to play had a broader range of notes. Another detail difficult to see is the mechanism of sound; recorders are flutes in which the sound is produced by a fipple.

[ 121 ] Reed pipes such as aulos used reed bundles like a shawm to produce notes, or single reeds like the zummara.

[ 121 ] Three and four hole pipes have been excavated in Novgorod, dating to the 11th and 15th centuries A.D. The timeline is not clear for the development into flutes with more holes. It isn't certain whether pipes with 3-4 holes were played alone, with a timbrel or tabor, or in pairs.

Double flutes in Eastern Europe date back to the 12th-13th centuries.

[ 123 ] It became common to use ox horn after 1375 A.D.

[ 123 ] The instrument's popularity in the 15th century led to an organ stop being created by 1511 with the name gemshorn or cor de chamois .

[ 124 ] It was illustrated by Virdung in 1511, and Agricola in 1528, but may have been in decline in the 16th century.

[ 124 ] [ 125 ] The mouthpiece of the instrument is at the top of the wide end of the horn; the large hole has been filled in with a blowing hole left at the top, creating a fipple .

[ 124 ] A sound hole to create the sound is cut into the sidewall of the horn, along with fingerholes.

[ 124 ] Artwork showing the instrument shows three or four fingerholes on the top.

[ 125 ] Three fingerholes and a thumb hole will play an octave.

[ 125 ] Modern builders have added soundholes.

Carved ivory horns of this style were called oliphants. Words in English: cowhorn , bullhorn , oxhorn , steerhorn .

Horn in English was used in Old English as well; in Beowulf a leader calls his men to battle with a horn.

[ 128 ] Among peaceful uses of these horns was for farmers to call to their cattle herds to bring them in.

[ 129 ] Could be drilled with as many as three or four fingerholes.

[ 129 ] Bockhorns have been found with fingerholes as far back as the Iron Age .

Pipes English word for a variety of instruments.

[ 132 ] Tube of wood, reed or other material through which air is blown.

[ 132 ] Sound occurs from interaction of air with a  sharp edge, notch, a duct, reed or some other form of mouthpiece.

[ 132 ] In European instruments the name "pipes" includes: duct flutes, recorders and three-hole pipes (or tabor pipes) reedpipes and bagpipes bladder pipes organ pipes panpipes willow pipes Word used in English and Old French [ 132 ] German Pfeife [ 132 ] Reedpipe [ 133 ] Clarinet Launeddas Mantura Sipsi Zhaleika Zummara See also alboka , in above in this table.

An aerophone in the form of a tube with "vibrating reed" inserted, either at the tip (as in launeddas) or inside the interior (as in a crumhorn or alboka).

[ 133 ] Reeds such as on the launeddas are single reeds; reeds on the shawm are double reeds. Includes bagpipes and bladder pipes (both with internal reeds).

Europeans made pipes out of reeds, splitting a reed to make a single reed. A single 3-hole reed pipe could be used for the pipe and tabor. The Launeddas was a more elaborate reed pipe, with multiple pipes; each might have its own reed or one reed might sound multiple pipes. These are more common in medieval art than the recorder (which has more holes and requires both hands to play).

Reed pipe traditions around the world include Asia, Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Africa.

Wooden trumpet After the fall of the Roman Empire, trumpets of metal were relatively rare in Europe. Europeans used horns (from goats, sheep and cattle) or carved them from wood.

The wooden trumpet was illustrated by Anglo Saxon artists in France in the Utrecht Psalter, circa 850 A.D. They drew long wooden horns with thick metal bands to hold the separate halves of the instrument together. Examples of surviving wooden instruments made in this fashion include the lur found in the Oseberg ship (two hollowed out halves held together with 5 rings or bands [ 139 ] ) and also the Irish wooden trumpet.

In Ireland, a wooden trumpet was found in the Erne River and attributed to the "early Christian Period...8th-10th century." [ 145 ] The yew-wood trumpet was carved in two halves lengthwise and bound together with strips of bronze, with a bronze mouthpiece.

Bells came into use in our churches as early as the year 400, and their introduction is ascribed to Paulinus , bishop of Nola, a town of Campania , in Italy. Their use spread rapidly, as in those unsettled times the church-bell was useful not only for summoning the faithful to religious services, but also for giving an alarm when danger threatened. Their use was sanctioned in 604 by Pope Sabinian, and a ceremony for blessing them was established a little later. Very large bells, for church towers, were probably not in common use until the eleventh century.

Towards the end of the 12th century, a new bell shape with an elongated, truncated cone-shaped bell body became popular: the sugarloaf bell. In bell manufacturing, the lost-wax casting process had been replaced by the shell-lifting process, and the new bell shape probably developed from this.

on May 17, 1945, an explosion destroyed the south tower. Part of the church collapsed and demolished the bridge connecting the towers, the gable end and the main portal (west) with its valuable sculptures as well as the vaults and the famous 'Bell of the Sinners', cast in 1386. It was probably the largest bell in Silesia with a circumference of 6.30 meters and an inner height of 1.80 meters, and was rung on holidays and the Lord's Prayer.

ProQuest 94449648 .

The bell which hangs in the southern tower of St. Mary Magdalen's Church and is named "St. Mary's bell," but is usually known as "the poor sinner's bell," rang out morning and evening on the 17th of July to remind all who heard it that it was cast on that day 500 years ago...the bell founder withdrew... leaving a boy in charge of the furnace... warning him not to mess with the catch that secured the seething metal in the caldron. The boy disregarded the caution...rushing in and seeing what he had intended to be his masterpiece ruined, as he thought, angered to madness, he slew the boy on the spot... he was condemned to die, and went to his doom while his beautiful bell pealed an invitation to all to pray for "the poor sinner..." ^ a b c d Price, Percival (1984).

Another unusual instrument depicted in the Cantigas is the albogón. This was derived from the Arabic al-buq, originally a generic word for horns and trumpets, but latterly restricted to horns. Supposedly, in the 10th century, during the reign of the Spanish Umayyad caliph, al-Hakam II, a horn was fitted with a double reed and fingerholes...Cantiga 300 shows a huge one being played, accompanied by an hourglass-shaped drum.
