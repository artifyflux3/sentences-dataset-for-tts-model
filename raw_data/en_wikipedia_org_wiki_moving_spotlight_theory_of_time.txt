The moving spotlight theory of time is a theory of time which describes past, present and future all co-existing, but only one moment in time being present at any given moment - as if picked out by a spotlight which moves from moment to moment. In this way, it is a compromise betweeen the A-theory and B-theory of time, in which the co-existence of all times is a form of eternalism , and the spotlight itself a form of presentism .

[ 1 ] Numerous variations of the theory have been put forward.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] Although it has been out of fashion for some time, the idea has recently been studied by Ross P. Cameron and Brandon Skow .

[ 3 ] The moving spotlight theory can be extended to cover not only the distinction between one time and another, but also the distinction between one consciousness and another.

[ 4 ] A variant of this theory is a principal component of the plot of Fred Hoyle 's novel October the First Is Too Late , which combines the idea of the moving spotlight with open individualism .
