The equation itself is: [ 1 ] v f 2 = v i 2 + 2 a Δ Δ x {\displaystyle v_{f}^{2}=v_{i}^{2}+2a\Delta x\,} where v f {\displaystyle v_{f}} is the object's final velocity along the x axis on which the acceleration is constant.

v i {\displaystyle v_{i}} is the object's initial velocity along the x axis.

a {\displaystyle a} is the object's acceleration along the x axis, which is given as a constant.

Δ Δ x {\displaystyle \Delta x\,} is the object's change in position along the x axis, also called displacement .

In this and all subsequent equations in this article, the subscript x {\displaystyle x} (as in v f x {\displaystyle {v_{f}}_{x}} ) is implied, but is not expressed explicitly for clarity in presenting the equations.

This equation is valid along any axis on which the acceleration is constant.

Derivation [ edit ] Without differentials and integration [ edit ] Begin with the following relations for the case of uniform acceleration: x f − − x i = v i t + 1 2 a t 2 {\displaystyle x_{f}-x_{i}=v_{i}t+{\tfrac {1}{2}}at^{2}} 1 v f − − v i = a t {\displaystyle v_{f}-v_{i}=at} 2 Take (1), and multiply both sides with acceleration a {\textstyle a} a ( x f − − x i ) = a v i t + 1 2 a 2 t 2 {\displaystyle a(x_{f}-x_{i})=av_{i}t+{\tfrac {1}{2}}a^{2}t^{2}} 3 The following rearrangement of the right hand side makes it easier to recognize the coming substitution: a ( x f − − x i ) = v i ( a t ) + 1 2 ( a t ) 2 {\displaystyle a(x_{f}-x_{i})=v_{i}(at)+{\tfrac {1}{2}}(at)^{2}} 4 Use (2) to substitute the product a t {\textstyle at} : a ( x f − − x i ) = v i ( v f − − v i ) + 1 2 ( v f − − v i ) 2 {\displaystyle a(x_{f}-x_{i})=v_{i}(v_{f}-v_{i})+{\tfrac {1}{2}}(v_{f}-v_{i})^{2}} 5 Work out the multiplications: a ( x f − − x i ) = v i v f − − v i 2 + 1 2 v f 2 − − v i v f + 1 2 v i 2 {\displaystyle a(x_{f}-x_{i})=v_{i}v_{f}-v_{i}^{2}+{\tfrac {1}{2}}v_{f}^{2}-v_{i}v_{f}+{\tfrac {1}{2}}v_{i}^{2}} 6 The crossterms v i v f {\textstyle v_{i}v_{f}} drop away against each other, leaving only squared terms: a ( x f − − x i ) = 1 2 v f 2 − − 1 2 v i 2 {\displaystyle a(x_{f}-x_{i})={\tfrac {1}{2}}v_{f}^{2}-{\tfrac {1}{2}}v_{i}^{2}} 7 (7) rearranges to the form of Torricelli's equation as presented at the start of the article: v f 2 = v i 2 + 2 a Δ Δ x {\displaystyle v_{f}^{2}=v_{i}^{2}+2a\Delta x} 8 Using differentials and integration [ edit ] Begin with the definitions of velocity as the derivative of the position, and acceleration as the derivative of the velocity: v = d x d t {\displaystyle v={\frac {dx}{dt}}} 9 a = d v d t {\displaystyle a={\frac {dv}{dt}}} 10 Set up integration from initial position x i {\textstyle x_{i}} to final position x f {\textstyle x_{f}} ∫ ∫ x i x f a d x {\displaystyle \int _{x_{i}}^{x_{f}}a\,dx} 11 In accordance with (9) we can substitute d x {\textstyle dx} with v d t {\textstyle v\,dt} , with corresponding change of limits.

∫ ∫ t i t f a v d t {\displaystyle \int _{t_{i}}^{t_{f}}a\,v\,dt} 12 Here changing the order of a {\textstyle a} and v {\textstyle v} makes it easier to recognize the upcoming substitution.

∫ ∫ t i t f v a d t {\displaystyle \int _{t_{i}}^{t_{f}}v\,a\,dt} 13 In accordance with (10) we can substitute a d t {\textstyle a\,dt} with d v {\textstyle dv} , with corresponding change of limits.

∫ ∫ v i v f v d v {\displaystyle \int _{v_{i}}^{v_{f}}v\,dv} 14 So we have: ∫ ∫ x i x f a d x = ∫ ∫ v i v f v d v {\displaystyle \int _{x_{i}}^{x_{f}}a\,dx=\int _{v_{i}}^{v_{f}}v\,dv} 15 Since the acceleration is constant, we can factor it out of the integration: a ∫ ∫ x i x f d x = ∫ ∫ v i v f v d v {\displaystyle a\int _{x_{i}}^{x_{f}}dx=\int _{v_{i}}^{v_{f}}v\,dv} 16 Evaluating the integration: a [ x ] x = x i x = x f = [ v 2 2 ] v = v i v = v f {\displaystyle a{\bigg [}x{\bigg ]}_{x=x_{i}}^{x=x_{f}}=\left[{\frac {v^{2}}{2}}\right]_{v=v_{i}}^{v=v_{f}}} 17 a ( x f − − x i ) = v f 2 2 − − v i 2 2 {\displaystyle a\left(x_{f}-x_{i}\right)={\frac {v_{f}^{2}}{2}}-{\frac {v_{i}^{2}}{2}}} 18 The factor x f − − x i {\textstyle x_{f}-x_{i}} is the displacement Δ Δ x {\textstyle \Delta x} : 2 a Δ Δ x = v f 2 − − v i 2 {\displaystyle 2a\Delta x=v_{f}^{2}-v_{i}^{2}} 19 v f 2 = v i 2 + 2 a Δ Δ x {\displaystyle v_{f}^{2}=v_{i}^{2}+2a\Delta x} 20 Application [ edit ] Combining Torricelli's equation with F = m a {\textstyle F=ma} gives the work-energy theorem.

Torricelli's equation and the generalization to non-uniform acceleration have the same form: Repeat of (16): ∫ ∫ x i x f a d x = ∫ ∫ v i v f v d v {\displaystyle \int _{x_{i}}^{x_{f}}a\,dx=\int _{v_{i}}^{v_{f}}v\,dv} 21 Evaluating the right hand side: ∫ ∫ x i x f a d x = 1 2 v f 2 − − 1 2 v i 2 {\displaystyle \int _{x_{i}}^{x_{f}}a\,dx={\tfrac {1}{2}}v_{f}^{2}-{\tfrac {1}{2}}v_{i}^{2}} 22 To compare with Torricelli's equation: repeat of (7): a ( x f − − x i ) = 1 2 v f 2 − − 1 2 v i 2 {\displaystyle a(x_{f}-x_{i})={\tfrac {1}{2}}v_{f}^{2}-{\tfrac {1}{2}}v_{i}^{2}} 23 To derive the work-energy theorem : start with F = m a {\textstyle F=ma} and on both sides state the  integral with respect to the position coordinate. If both sides are integrable then the resulting expression is valid: ∫ ∫ x i x f F d x = ∫ ∫ x i x f m a d x {\displaystyle \int _{x_{i}}^{x_{f}}F\,dx=\int _{x_{i}}^{x_{f}}ma\,dx} 24 Use (22) to process the right hand side: ∫ ∫ x i x f F d x = 1 2 m v f 2 − − 1 2 m v i 2 {\displaystyle \int _{x_{i}}^{x_{f}}F\,dx={\tfrac {1}{2}}mv_{f}^{2}-{\tfrac {1}{2}}mv_{i}^{2}} 25 The reason that the right hand sides of (22) and (23) are the same: First consider the case with two consecutive stages of different uniform acceleration, first from s 0 {\textstyle s_{0}} to s 1 {\textstyle s_{1}} , and then from s 1 {\textstyle s_{1}} to s 2 {\textstyle s_{2}} .

Expressions for each of the two stages: a 1 ( s 1 − − s 0 ) = 1 2 v 1 2 − − 1 2 v 0 2 {\displaystyle a_{1}(s_{1}-s_{0})={\tfrac {1}{2}}v_{1}^{2}-{\tfrac {1}{2}}v_{0}^{2}} a 2 ( s 2 − − s 1 ) = 1 2 v 2 2 − − 1 2 v 1 2 {\displaystyle a_{2}(s_{2}-s_{1})={\tfrac {1}{2}}v_{2}^{2}-{\tfrac {1}{2}}v_{1}^{2}} Since these expressions are for consecutive intervals they can be added; the result  is a valid expression.

Upon addition the intermediate term 1 2 v 1 2 {\textstyle {\tfrac {1}{2}}v_{1}^{2}} drops out; only the outer terms 1 2 v 2 2 {\textstyle {\tfrac {1}{2}}v_{2}^{2}} and 1 2 v 0 2 {\textstyle {\tfrac {1}{2}}v_{0}^{2}} remain: a 1 ( s 1 − − s 0 ) + a 2 ( s 2 − − s 1 ) = 1 2 v 2 2 − − 1 2 v 0 2 {\displaystyle a_{1}(s_{1}-s_{0})+a_{2}(s_{2}-s_{1})={\tfrac {1}{2}}v_{2}^{2}-{\tfrac {1}{2}}v_{0}^{2}} 26 The above result generalizes: the total distance can be subdivided into any number of subdivisions; after adding everything together only the outer terms remain; all of the intermediate terms drop out.

The generalization of (26) to an arbitrary number of subdivisions of the total interval from s 0 {\textstyle s_{0}} to s n {\textstyle s_{n}} can be expressed as a summation: ∑ ∑ i = 1 n a i ( s i − − s i − − 1 ) = 1 2 v n 2 − − 1 2 v i − − 1 2 {\displaystyle \sum _{i=1}^{n}a_{i}(s_{i}-s_{i-1})={\tfrac {1}{2}}v_{n}^{2}-{\tfrac {1}{2}}v_{i-1}^{2}} 27 See also [ edit ] Equation of motion References [ edit ] ^ Leandro Bertoldo (2008).
