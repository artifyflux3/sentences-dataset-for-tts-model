Garrity Robert Lazarsfeld William Edgar Fulton (born August 29, 1939) is an American mathematician , specializing in algebraic geometry .

Education and career [ edit ] He received his undergraduate degree from Brown University in 1961 and his doctorate from Princeton University in 1966.  His Ph.D. thesis, written under the supervision of Gerard Washnitzer , was on The fundamental group of an algebraic curve .

Fulton worked at Princeton and Brandeis University from 1965 until 1970, when he began teaching at Brown.  In 1987 he moved to the University of Chicago .

[ 1 ] He is, as of 2011, a professor at the University of Michigan .

[ 2 ] As of 2024, Fulton had supervised the doctoral work of 24 students at Brown, Chicago, and Michigan.

Fulton is known as the author or coauthor of a number of popular texts, including Algebraic Curves and Representation Theory .

Awards and honors [ edit ] In 1996 he received the Steele Prize for mathematical exposition for his text Intersection Theory .

[ 1 ] Fulton is a member of the United States National Academy of Sciences since 1997; a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences from 1998, and was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 2000.

[ 3 ] In 2010, he was awarded the Steele Prize for Lifetime Achievement.

[ 4 ] In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society .
