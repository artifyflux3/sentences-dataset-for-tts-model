**Space art,** also known as **astronomical art**, is a [genre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genre "Genre") of [art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art "Art") that [visually](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_representation "Visual representation") depicts the [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe "Universe") through various [artistic styles.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_(visual_arts) "Style (visual arts)") It may also refer to [artworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_of_art "Work of art") sent into [space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_space "Outer space").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_art#cite_note-NASA's_Space_Art_Program2-1)

The development of space art was closely linked to advancements in telescope and imaging [technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology "Technology"), which enabled more precise [observations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation "Observation") of the [night sky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_sky "Night sky"). Some space artists work directly with [scientists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientist "Scientist") to explore new ways to expand [the arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_arts "The arts"), [humanities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanities "Humanities"), and [cultural expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_expressions "Cultural expressions") relative to space. Space art may communicate ideas about space, often including an artistic interpretation of [cosmological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology "Cosmology")[phenomena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon "Phenomenon") and [scientific discoveries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_discoveries "Scientific discoveries").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_art#cite_note-2)

For many decades, [visual artists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_arts "Visual arts") have explored the topic of space using traditional painting media, followed recently by the use of [digital media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_media "Digital media") for the same purpose. [Science-fiction magazines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction_magazines "Science fiction magazines") and picture essay magazines were some of the first major outlets for space art, often featuring planets, spaceships, and dramatic [alien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life "Extraterrestrial life") landscapes. [Chesley Bonestell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chesley_Bonestell "Chesley Bonestell"), R. A. Smith, [Lucien Rudaux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucien_Rudaux "Lucien Rudaux"), [David A. Hardy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_A._Hardy "David A. Hardy"), and [Ludek Pesek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludek_Pesek "Ludek Pesek") were some of the artists actively involved in visualizing topics such as [space exploration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_exploration "Space exploration") and [colonization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_colonization "Space colonization") in the early days of the genre. [Astronomers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomer "Astronomer") and experts in [rocketry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace_engineering "Aerospace engineering") also played roles in inspiring artists in this genre.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_art#cite_note-NASA's_Space_Art_Program2-1)

[NASA’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA "NASA") second administrator, [James E. Webb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_E._Webb "James E. Webb"), created the space agency's Space Art program in 1962, four years after its inception.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_art#cite_note-NASA's_Space_Art_Program2-1)[Bonestell's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chesley_Bonestell "Chesley Bonestell") work in this program often depicted various [celestial bodies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_object "Astronomical object") and landscapes, highlighting both the destinations and the imagined technologies used to reach them.

[Trouvelot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89tienne_L%C3%A9opold_Trouvelot "Étienne Léopold Trouvelot"), [The great nebula in Orion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_nebula_in_Orion "Great nebula in Orion") (1875).

Astronomical art is a genre of space art that focuses on visual representations of [outer space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_space "Outer space"). It encompasses various themes, including the space environment as a new [frontier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontier "Frontier") for humanity, depictions of alien worlds, representations of extreme phenomena like [black holes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole "Black hole"), and artistic concepts inspired by [astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy "Astronomy").

Astronomical art emerged as a distinct genre in the 1940s and 1950s. [Chesley Bonestell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chesley_Bonestell "Chesley Bonestell") was recognized for his skills in addressing perspective challenges and creating visual representations of astronomical concepts. [Contemporary artists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contemporary_art "Contemporary art") continue to contribute to the visualization of ideas within the space community, such as depicting theoretical capabilities for [interstellar travel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_travel "Interstellar travel") and illustrating hypothetical [deep-space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_space_exploration "Deep space exploration") phenomena.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_art#cite_note-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_art#cite_note-4)

Astronomical art is the most recent of several art movements that have explored ideas emerging from the ongoing exploration of Earth. Finding its roots in genres such as the [Hudson River School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_River_School "Hudson River School") or [Luminism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminism_(American_art_style) "Luminism (American art style)"), most astronomical artists use traditional painting methods or digital equivalents in a way that brings the viewer to the frontiers of [human knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge "Knowledge") gathered in the exploration of space. Such works usually portray things in the [visual language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_language "Visual language") of [realism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realism_(arts) "Realism (arts)") extrapolated to exotic environments, whose details reflect ongoing knowledge and educated guesswork. An example of the process of creating astronomical art would be studying and visiting [desert environments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert "Desert") to experience something of what it might be like on [Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars "Mars") and painting based on such experiences. Another would be to hear of an astronomical concept, and then seek out published articles or experts in the field. Usually, there is an artistic effort to emphasize the favourable visual elements, just as a photographer composes a picture. Notable astronomical art often reflects the artist's interpretation and imagination regarding the subject portrayed.

[Science fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction "Science fiction") magazines such as _[Fantasy and Science Fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy\_and\_Science\_Fiction "Fantasy and Science Fiction")_, _[Amazing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazing\_Stories "Amazing Stories")_, _Astounding_ (later renamed _[Analog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog\_Science\_Fiction\_and\_Fact "Analog Science Fiction and Fact")_), and _[Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy\_Science\_Fiction "Galaxy Science Fiction")_ were platforms for space and astronomical art in the 1950s. Picture essay magazines of the time, such as _[Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life\_(magazine) "Life (magazine)")_, _[Collier's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collier%27s "Collier's")_, and _Coronet_, were other major outlets for such art. Today, astronomical art can be seen in magazines such as _[Sky and Telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky\_and\_Telescope "Sky and Telescope")_, _[The Planetary Report](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Planetary\_Report "The Planetary Report")_, and occasionally in _[Scientific American](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific\_American "Scientific American")_. The [NASA fine arts program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_fine_arts_program "NASA fine arts program") has been an ongoing effort to hire artists to create works generally specific to a particular space project. The program documents historical events in recognizable form for professional artists. The [NASA Fine Arts Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_Art_Program "NASA Art Program") operated in an era of forward progress under its first head director, James Dean.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_art#cite_note-5) Even then, pictorial realism seemed a subset rather than a dominant visual influence.

The works that document [space flight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight "Spaceflight") situations, such as those referenced above, are similar in concept to government efforts during [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II") to send artists to battle zones for documentation. Much of which appeared in contemporary _[Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life\_(magazine) "Life (magazine)")_ magazines. Most of today's widely published space and astronomical artists have belonged to the [International Association of Astronomical Artists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Association_of_Astronomical_Artists "International Association of Astronomical Artists") since 1983.

The _[Pillars of Creation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pillars\_of\_Creation "Pillars of Creation")_[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_art#cite_note-9) taken by the [Hubble Space Telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope "Hubble Space Telescope") and other Hubble photos often evoke intense responses from viewers; for example, Hubble's [planetary nebula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_nebula "Planetary nebula") images.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_art#cite_note-10)

[Albrecht Altdorfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albrecht_Altdorfer "Albrecht Altdorfer")'s painting _[The Battle of Issus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Battle\_of\_Alexander\_at\_Issus "The Battle of Alexander at Issus")_ (1529) shows the [curvature of the Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_Earth "Spherical Earth") from a great height.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_art#cite_note-12)[Galileo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo "Galileo")'s sketches of the Moon from the _[Sidereus Nuncius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidereus\_Nuncius "Sidereus Nuncius")_ (1610) were published among other early descriptions of the Moon's [topography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topography "Topography"). In 1711, [Donato Creti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donato_Creti "Donato Creti") painted a series of astronomers viewing other planets of the [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System "Solar System") through a telescope to interest the [Vatican](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_See "Holy See") in establishing an [astronomical observatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observatory "Observatory").

In the early 1870s-1900s, [Étienne Léopold Trouvelot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89tienne_L%C3%A9opold_Trouvelot "Étienne Léopold Trouvelot") published a series of [Chromolithographs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromolithographs "Chromolithographs") of his pastels of astronomical subjects.

In 1874, [James Carpenter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Carpenter_(astronomer) "James Carpenter (astronomer)") and [James Nasmyth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Nasmyth "James Nasmyth")'s work _The Moon: Considered as a Planet, a World, and a Satellite_ included photographs of sculpted models of [Lunar features](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_lunar_features "List of lunar features"), in the marked [vertical exaggeration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_exaggeration "Vertical exaggeration") of the actual relief of the Moon.

In 1877, [Paul Dominique Philippoteaux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Dominique_Philippoteaux "Paul Dominique Philippoteaux") and engraver Laplante illustrated [Jules Verne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_Verne "Jules Verne")'s story _[Off on a Comet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off\_on\_a\_Comet "Off on a Comet"),_ including an imaginative view looking up at the [rings of Saturn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rings_of_Saturn "Rings of Saturn") from the planet itself.

In 1918, [Howard Russell Butler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Russell_Butler "Howard Russell Butler") deliberately made use of the dynamic range of [human vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception "Visual perception") in painting a [total eclipse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse "Eclipse") based on direct observation.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_art#cite_note-lawrence-13)

In 1927, Scriven Bolten created lunar landscape images for the _[Illustrated London News](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illustrated\_London\_News "Illustrated London News")_ using painted photos of plaster models.

In 1937, [Lucien Rudaux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucien_Rudaux "Lucien Rudaux") painted many works for _Sur Les Autres Mondes._[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_art#cite_note-14)[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_art#cite_note-15)

In 1944, [Chesley Bonestell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chesley_Bonestell "Chesley Bonestell")'s paintings of Saturn seen from its different moons appeared in [_Life_ magazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_(magazine) "Life (magazine)"), introducing astronomical art to a wide American audience. Books featuring Bonestell's art include _The Conquest Of Space_ (1949), _The Exploration Of Mars_ (1956), and _Life'_ s _The World We Live In_ (1955).

The second [Hayden Planetarium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayden_Planetarium "Hayden Planetarium") Symposium on Space Travel, held in New York in October 1952, resulted in a series of widely read space flight articles in _Collier's_ magazine, illustrated by Bonestell and others.

In 1963, [Ludek Pesek's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lud%C4%9Bk_Pe%C5%A1ek "Luděk Pešek") paintings filled the large volumes of _[The Moon And the Planets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth,\_Moon,\_and\_Planets "Earth, Moon, and Planets")_, and the 1968 volume _Our Planet Earth-From The Beginning_.

The 1980 [Cosmos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmos:_A_Personal_Voyage "Cosmos: A Personal Voyage")[PBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBS "PBS") television show and book used the work of many space artists. Host [Carl Sagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan "Carl Sagan") used such art in several of his books.

The 21st century expanded to sending art into space.

### First art created in space

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Space_art&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: First art created in space")]

The first active artist in space was [Alexei Leonov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexei_Leonov "Alexei Leonov"), who produced the first drawing in space onboard [Voskhod 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voskhod_2 "Voskhod 2") in 1965, depicting an orbital sunrise.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_art#cite_note-GuardianFirst-16)

### The first original oil paintings flown into outer space

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Space_art&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: The first original oil paintings flown into outer space")]

An [art conservation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_and_restoration_of_cultural_property "Conservation and restoration of cultural property") experiment from Vertical Horizons,[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_art#cite_note-17) founded by Howard Wishnow and Ellery Kurtz, was flown aboard the [Space Shuttle _Columbia_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Columbia "Space Shuttle Columbia")[STS-61-C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-61-C "STS-61-C") on January 12, 1986. Four original oil paintings by American artist Ellery Kurtz were flown in one of NASA's [GetAway Special](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getaway_Special "Getaway Special") (G.A.S.) containers mounted to a bridge in the shuttle cargo bay. These original works of art are the first oil paintings to enter Earth's orbit. This NASA GAS canister, designated G-481, was the 46th such canister flown aboard a Space Shuttle. The Space Shuttle _Columbia_ orbited the Earth 98 times during its mission duration of 6 days, 2 hours, 3 minutes, and 51 seconds. _Columbia_ was launched from [Kennedy Space Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy_Space_Center "Kennedy Space Center"), [Cape Canaveral, Florida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral,_Florida "Cape Canaveral, Florida"), on January 12, 1986, and landed at the Kennedy Space Center on January 18, 1986.

_[Fallen Astronaut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallen\_Astronaut "Fallen Astronaut")_, left on the Moon by [David Scott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Scott "David Scott") during the [Apollo 15](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_15 "Apollo 15") mission

Small art objects have been carried on several Apollo missions, such as gold emblems and a small _[Fallen Astronaut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallen\_Astronaut "Fallen Astronaut")_ figurine that was left on the Moon during the 1971 [Apollo 15](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_15 "Apollo 15") mission. Visual observations have been recorded in drawings and commentary by earlier cosmonauts and astronauts of difficult-to-photograph phenomena such as the [airglow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airglow "Airglow"), twilight colors, and outer details of the [solar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_corona "Solar corona") corona.

Another work, later brought to Earth orbit sometime in the mid-80s, was a study of the golden sunlight on a Soviet space station by Russian artist Andrei Sokolov, carried aboard the [Soviet Mir space station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mir "Mir") starting with modules in February 1986. In 1984, [Joseph McShane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_McShane "Joseph McShane") and [Lowry Burgess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowry_Burgess "Lowry Burgess") had their conceptual artwork flown aboard the Space Shuttle utilizing NASA's 'Get Away Special' program.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_art#cite_note-18) The first sculpture specifically designed for human habitat in orbit was Arthur Woods' _[Cosmic Dancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic\_Dancer\_(artwork) "Cosmic Dancer (artwork)")_[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_art#cite_note-19)[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_art#cite_note-20) which was sent to the Mir station in 1993. In 1995, Arthur Woods organized _Ars ad Astra, the first art exhibition in Earth orbit._[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_art#cite_note-21) consisting of 20 original artworks from 20 artists and an electronic archive also took place on the Mir space station as part of ESA's [EUROMIR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euromir "Euromir")'95 mission. In 1998, [Frank Pietronigro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Pietronigro "Frank Pietronigro") flew Research Project Number 33: Investigating the Creative Process in a Micro-gravity Environment, where he created 'drift paintings' and danced in microgravity space. In 2006, the artist returned to micro-gravity flight to create three new works, one in collaboration with [Lowry Burgess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowry_Burgess "Lowry Burgess"); _Moments in the Infinite Absolute, Flags in Space!,_ and a new form of microgravity mobile.

The [Slovenian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia "Slovenia") theater director [Dragan Živadinov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragan_%C5%BDivadinov "Dragan Živadinov") staged a performance called _Noordung Zero Gravity Biomechanical_ during a [parabolic flight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced-gravity_aircraft "Reduced-gravity aircraft") organized through the [Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuri_Gagarin_Cosmonaut_Training_Center "Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center") facility in Star City in 1999. The UK arts group [The Arts Catalyst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arts_Catalyst "Arts Catalyst"), with the MIR consortium (Arts Catalyst, Projekt Atol, V2 Organisation, Leonardo-Olats), organized a series of parabolic 'zero gravity' flights for artistic and cultural experimentation with the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Centre, as well as with the [European Space Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Space_Agency "European Space Agency"), between 2000 and 2004, including _Investigations in Microgravity,_[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_art#cite_note-22)_MIR Flight 001,_[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_art#cite_note-23) and _MIR Campaign 2003._[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_art#cite_note-24)[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_art#cite_note-25)[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_art#cite_note-26)[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_art#cite_note-27) Artists who participated in these flights and visits to Russia and ESA have included the Otolith Group, shortlisted in 2011 for the [Turner Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turner_Prize "Turner Prize"), Stefan Gec, Ansuman Biswas and [Jem Finer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jem_Finer "Jem Finer"), Kitsou Dubois, [Yuri Leiderman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuri_Leiderman "Yuri Leiderman"), and [Marcel·li Antunez Roca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel%C2%B7l%C3%AD_Ant%C3%BAnez_Roca "Marcel·lí Antúnez Roca").

[Richard Garriott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Garriott "Richard Garriott") visited the [International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station "International Space Station"), via the [Soyuz TMA-13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_TMA-13 "Soyuz TMA-13") on October 12, 2008, where he displayed an art exhibition, _Celestial Matters_, during his 12 days in orbit. _Celestial Matters_ included works by ten American artists as well as work Garriott created himself while in orbit, honoring his heritage in art and science. The art was later exhibited at the Charles Bank Gallery in New York City in October 2011.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_art#cite_note-Chow_(2011)-28) Garriott also exhibited _Astrogeneris Mementos_, two small works, somewhat reminiscent of [memento mori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_mori "Memento mori") or [hairwork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hairwork "Hairwork"), containing locks of hair from Richard Garriott and [Owen Garriott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owen_Garriott "Owen Garriott") sealed in chambers by [Steve Brudniak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Brudniak "Steve Brudniak"), the first [assemblage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assemblage_(art) "Assemblage (art)") sculptures exhibited in outer space.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_art#cite_note-Gupta_(2013)-29)[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_art#cite_note-Brannon_(2018)-30)[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_art#cite_note-Garriott_Space_Blog_(2009)-31)

### Sojourner 2020 project onboard the International Space Station

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Space_art&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Sojourner 2020 project onboard the International Space Station")]

In the Sojourner 2020 project from [MIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"), the Space Exploration Initiative took nine selected artists to develop art projects on board the International Space Station. Sojourner 2020 was a 1.5U size device (100mm x 100mm x 152.4mm) that was launched into low Earth orbit between March 7 and April 7 during the [COVID-19 pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic "COVID-19 pandemic"). It featured a three-layer telescoping structure that simulated three different "gravities": [zero gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_gravity "Zero gravity"), [lunar gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_gravity "Lunar gravity"), and Martian gravity. Each layer of the structure rotated independently. The top layer remained still in weightlessness, while the middle and bottom layers spun at different speeds to produce [centripetal accelerations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration "Acceleration") that mimicked lunar gravity and Martian gravity respectively. Each layer carried six pockets that held the projects. Each pocket was a container with a diameter of 10 mm and a depth of 12 mm. The artist proposed and accomplished artworks in a variety of different mediums, including carved stone sculptures by Erin Genia, liquid pigment experiments by Andrea Ling and Levi Cai, sculptures made of [transgender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender "Transgender")[hormone replacement medicines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone_therapy "Hormone therapy") by Adriana Knouf, and living organisms, like marine [diatoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diatom "Diatom") of the genus _[Phaeodactylum Tricornutum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phaeodactylum\_tricornutum "Phaeodactylum tricornutum")_, by Luis Guzmán.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_art#cite_note-35)

The nine artist groups selected onboard Sojourner 2020 were:

The [International Association of Astronomical Artists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Association_of_Astronomical_Artists "International Association of Astronomical Artists") (IAAA), founded in 1982, is a key institution promoting space-themed visual art. It was co‑founded by notable American space artist [Kim Poor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Poor_(space_artist) "Kim Poor (space artist)"), who also served as its first president.[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_art#cite_note-41)

In 2007, Poor also created _Spacefest_, an annual gathering for astronauts, space artists, and enthusiasts held in Tucson, showcasing astronaut-artist collaborations and rare artworks.[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_art#cite_note-42)
