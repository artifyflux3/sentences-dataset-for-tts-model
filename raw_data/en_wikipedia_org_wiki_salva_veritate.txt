Substitution salva veritate of co-extensional terms can fail in opaque contexts .

[ 1 ] The literal translation of the Latin " salva veritate " is "with (or by) unharmed truth", using ablative of manner : " salva " meaning "rescue," "salvation," or "welfare," and " veritate " meaning "reality" or "truth".

Leibniz [ edit ] The phrase occurs in two fragments from Gottfried Leibniz 's General Science. Characteristics : In Chapter 19, Definition 1, Leibniz writes: "Two terms are the same ( eadem ) if one can be substituted for the other without altering the truth of any statement ( salva veritate )." In Chapter 20, Definition 1, Leibniz writes: "Terms which can be substituted for one another wherever we please without altering the truth of any statement ( salva veritate ), are the same ( eadem ) or coincident ( coincidentia ). For example, ' triangle ' and 'trilateral', for in every proposition demonstrated by Euclid concerning 'triangle', 'trilateral' can be substituted without loss of truth ( salva veritate )." Quine [ edit ] W.V.O. Quine takes substitutivity salva veritate to be the same as the "indiscernibility of identicals". Given a true statement, one of its two terms may be substituted for the other in any true statement and the result will be true.

[ 2 ] He continues to show that depending on context, the statement may change in value. In fact, the whole quantified modal logic of necessity is dependent on context and empty otherwise; for it collapses if essence is withdrawn.

[ 3 ] For example, the statements: (1) Giorgione = Barbarelli, (2) Giorgione was so-called because of his size are true;  however, replacement of the name 'Giorgione' by the name 'Barbarelli' turns (2) into the falsehood: Barbarelli was so-called because of his size.

[ 4 ] Quine's example here refers to Giorgio Barbarelli 's sobriquet "Giorgione", an Italian name roughly glossed as "Big George."
