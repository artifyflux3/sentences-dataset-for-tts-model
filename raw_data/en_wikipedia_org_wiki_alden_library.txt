[ 9 ] The university was first conceived in the 1787 contract between the Board of Treasury of the United States and the Ohio Company of Associates , which set aside the College Lands to support a university, and subsequently approved by the territorial legislature in 1802 and the Ohio General Assembly in 1804.

[ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] The university opened for students in 1809, [ 13 ] and was the first university to be established in the former Northwest Territory .

[ nb 1 ] [ 12 ] Ohio University comprises nine campuses, nine undergraduate colleges, a graduate college, a college of medicine, and a public affairs school. It offers more than 250 areas of undergraduate study [ 14 ] as well as certificates, master's, and doctoral degrees.

[ 15 ] It is a member of the University System of Ohio . The university is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission [ 16 ] and classified among "R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity".

[ 17 ] As of fall 2020, the university's total enrollment at Athens was slightly more than 18,000, while the all-campus enrollment was just over 30,000.

[ 5 ] Ohio's intercollegiate athletic teams are known as the Bobcats and compete in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) at the Division I level as charter members of the Mid-American Conference .

[ 18 ] Ohio football has participated in 16 bowl games through the 2023 season. The men's basketball team has made 14 appearances in the NCAA Division I basketball tournament , with their most recent appearance in 2021 .

[ 19 ] History [ edit ] Main article: History of Ohio University Charter and establishment [ edit ] Manasseh Cutler Hall , constructed by 1816 and opened in 1819, was the first academic building in the former Northwest Territory and was named after university founder Manasseh Cutler .

A university in the Ohio Country was first envisioned by Manasseh Cutler , credited as the school's founder along with Revolutionary War Brigadier General Rufus Putnam .

[ 20 ] In addition to being instrumental in its founding, Putnam was also an original trustee of the university. Putnam Hall there is named for him.

[ 21 ] Cutler had served as a chaplain in George Washington 's Continental Army . The institution's first name was American Western University.

[ 22 ] In 1797, settlers from Marietta traveled downstream on the Ohio River and up the Hocking River to establish a location for the school in what the Congress designated as the College Lands , founding Athens due to its location directly between the original capital of Chillicothe and Marietta. In 1802, approval was granted by the territorial government for the establishment of the American Western University, but the school was not operated under that name. Ohio University was recognized by the new state on February 18, 1804, with its charter being certified by the Ohio General Assembly . This last approval happened eleven months after Ohio was admitted to the Union. The first three students enrolled in 1809. The first two bachelor's degrees were granted in 1815.

[ 23 ] 19th century to present [ edit ] Ellis Hall was built in the early 20th century entirely with state funding.

[ 24 ] Ohio University was closed between 1843 and 1848.

[ 25 ] Women were first admitted to the university in 1868. In 1874, the Ohio General Assembly created the new Ohio State University in Columbus as a land grant school upon passage of the Morrill Act of 1862. At that time some representatives proposed that both Ohio University and Miami University be demoted to preparatory schools.

[ 26 ] In 1880, it was instead suggested that Ohio and Miami be merged directly with Ohio State, but the 1896 Sleeper Bill, introduced by Athenian David L. Sleeper , the speaker of the Ohio House of Representatives, provided annual support for the university; this set the precedent for continuing state support of Ohio University.

[ 25 ] A second challenge was defeated in 1906. The 20th century saw dramatic growth in student enrollment, academic offerings, and research facilities. Between 1955 and 1970, undergraduate enrollment tripled from 7,000 to 20,000. During this era, the campus grew, with the construction of 25 new dormitories located on two new residential college greens, with radio and television stations, research and classroom facilities, and the construction of the 13,000-seat Convocation Center arena. Ohio University ranks among the top 25 largest residential college campuses in the United States, and the 5th largest in total campus size after acquiring acreage from adjacent hilltop properties in the 1990s.

Ohio restructured its two colleges into five in 1935, establishing the colleges of Commerce, Fine Arts, and Applied Science in addition to the existing colleges of Arts & Sciences and Education. The graduate college was created in 1936, and the first PhD program was initiated in 1956 in chemistry.

[ 27 ] Starting mid–century, the university also began to establish regional campuses throughout southeast Ohio. The first, Ohio University – Chillicothe , was opened in 1946 to help eliminate post- World War II overcrowding on the university's main campus. The school began with 281 students, 70 percent of which were armed services veterans. Later campuses would come in 1946 at Zanesville , 1956 in Ironton and Lancaster , 1957 in St. Clairsville , and formerly Proctorville in 2006.

In 1964, U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson publicly referenced his Great Society initiative for the first time on the College Green , [ 28 ] [ 29 ] giving the university exposure across America and internationally. On May 4, 1970, the Ohio National Guard was ordered to open fire on students demonstrating against the Vietnam War at Kent State University , killing 4 and wounding 9. At the same time, there were sit-ins and anti-war riots at Ohio University, even more intense than those of Kent State. This was partly due to the administration's refusal to close the university; instead of going home, many students from other Ohio universities that did close came to Athens to protest further. When the Ohio National Guard was called in to Athens, there was a 3-hour battle at the Baker Center, resulting in 23 injured and 54 arrested students. On May 15, the campus was closed.

[ 27 ] [ 30 ] Alden Library was completed in 1969. In 1975, Ohio established its medical school, known as the Heritage College of Osteopathic Medicine . Heritage is the only medical school in the state to award the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine degree. In 1979, on the university's 175th anniversary, Chubu University of Japan donated 175 cherry trees.

[ 31 ] The Ohio University Innovation Center, a technology business incubator, started in 1983. The Ohio University Edison Biotechnology Institute was founded in 1984. In the Glidden administration, from 1994 to 2004, new construction included the Life Sciences Research Facility, Emeriti Park, Walter Hall, plus major renovations to Gordy Hall, Grover Center, and Memorial Auditorium; the expansion of Bentley Hall and Copeland Hall; and groundwork for the new Baker Center that opened in 2007.

[ 27 ] In the Fall of 2012, Ohio University converted its academic calendar from quarters to semesters, after first having changed to quarters in 1967.

[ 27 ] Campuses [ edit ] Athens campus [ edit ] Templeton-Blackburn Alumni Memorial Auditorium The main residential university campus is in Athens, Ohio, overlooking the Hocking River .

[ 32 ] Constructed under the Jefferson presidency , New England and Early Americana Federalist themes are prevalent in the university's earliest architecture.  Development of the campus began in 1812 with the erection of the university's central building, Manasseh Cutler Hall , a registered national landmark, and built only 20 years after the White House. Cutler Hall's University Chimes, replacing an existing old cast iron bell, chime on the half hour every day until 9:00pm. The original bell, the 3rd oldest university bell in America, which is still hung in the Cutler Hall Cupola, rang to signal the start and end of the school day, as well as to signal the end of different class periods. Cast in the early 1800s, it served the university for well over a century.

College Green [ edit ] Main article: College Green of Ohio University The entrance to the College Green The historic College Green is the centralized quadrangle lawn and location of significant campus buildings: Manasseh Cutler Hall , the Office of the President; Wilson Hall, the College of Arts & Sciences ; McGuffey Hall, named for William McGuffey ; and the College Gateway.

[ 33 ] These three original primary structures are featured elements of the official current university logo and maintain true to their original design of over 200 years ago. The College Green has changed little in the past two centuries, which contributes to the university's colonial appearance. The green, inspired by the university founders, is based upon the classic layout of traditional English and New England towns and similar to university quadrangles.

[ 34 ] College Green features Galbreath Chapel, the spire of which, topped with a brass weather vane, is modeled after that of the portico of Nash's All Souls Church in London . Other buildings on the College Green include Chubb Hall, home to Undergraduate Admissions as well as the Offices of the Bursar and Registrar; Ellis Hall, home to the departments of English, Classics , Religious Studies, and Philosophy; Templeton-Blackburn Memorial Auditorium; as well as Bryan Hall, an upperclassman residence hall. The University Sundial, located behind Galbreath Chapel, was constructed in 1907 and marks the original location of the university's first building. College Green is framed by two main university gateways. Alumni Gateway, built in 1915, features the text "That thou Mayest Grow In Knowledge, Wisdom and Love," borrowed from the Latin phrase inscribed over a gateway to the University of Padua and was dedicated upon the 100th anniversary of the university's first graduating class.

[ 35 ] The newer College Gate, built in the 1960s, features words taken from the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 regarding public education. Traditions surrounding College Green include the latter half of first year convocation, where students, led by the Ohio University Marching 110 , march up Richland Avenue, onto Presidents Street, turning north onto Court Street, and entering the Green through the College Gate at the corner of Court and Union Streets. From there, a large involvement fair is held where students find clubs they wish to join.

John Calhoun Baker University Center [ edit ] Main article: John Calhoun Baker University Center The Baker University Center sits atop a hillside where the Hocking River had cut.

The John Calhoun Baker University Center, which opened in January 2007, is named after the 14th president of the university. The facility replaced the original Baker Center located on East Union Street across from College Green and serves as the hub of campus activity. Electronic maps and virtual university e-tours, available at center information desks and online, direct visitors across campus.

[ 36 ] The building features Georgian-influenced Federal architecture and large windows that admit natural light and afford expansive views of the southern and western sides of the campus.

Baker Center contains a large food court called West 82; a pub bistro called Latitude 39; a Grand Ballroom; The Honors Collegium, The Wall of Presidents, the Bobcat Student Lounge, a shop called Bobcat Depot that sells apparel, computers, and accessories; a theater seating 400; study areas; computer labs; administrative offices; and numerous conference rooms. The Front Room, a large coffee house named after a former popular university rathskeller , features a stage, artwork and a community fireplace. It serves Starbucks products and university bakery items and is housed on the fourth floor, which opens onto its own outside terrace as well as onto the intersection of Park Place and Court Streets, making it a popular spot for students between classes. Other amenities include a United States Post Office [ 37 ] and the Trisolini Art Gallery, named after a prominent fine arts faculty member.

[ 38 ] East Green [ edit ] Jefferson Hall, completed 1956 and opened 1958, anchors the East Green.

[ 39 ] [ 40 ] There are twelve residence halls on East Green.

[ 41 ] This area of the university is the oldest residential green and includes three of the steepest walkways at the hilly Athens campus: Morton Hill, the Bryan Hall terrace and staircase, and Jefferson Hill. Each walkway affords East Green residents access to classrooms if they are willing to walk or bicycle. East Green is also home to Shively Court, a newly renovated dining hall with dine-in, take-out, and grab-and-go options.

[ 42 ] East Green includes Jefferson Marketplace with several food vendors.
