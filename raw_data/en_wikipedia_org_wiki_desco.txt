DESCO is an underwater diving equipment maker which was first organized in 1937 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin as Diving Equipment and Salvage Co.

It was founded by: [ 1 ] Max Eugene Nohl , a diver who lived in Milwaukee. In the early 1930s, he had national publicity for his salvage operations on a sunken steamship , the John Dwight .

John D. Craig , a Hollywood movie producer, a pioneer in underwater photography , who wanted to film the possible salvage of the RMS Lusitania .

Jack Browne , a diver.

Edgar End , a physician who worked in hyperbaric medicine .

In 1935, Nohl, Craig and Browne designed a lightweight heliox diving suit to dive to the liner Lusitania , sunk in May 1915 by a German U-boat in 312 feet of water, 11 miles (18 km) off the southern coast of Ireland.

[ 2 ] On 1 December 1937, in Lake Michigan , Max Nohl dived to 420 feet (130 m) with DESCO equipment, breaking the previous record of 344 feet (105 m) set by British divers in 1930.

[ 3 ] In World War II DESCO made hardhat diving gear and oxygen rebreathers for the US Navy .

In 1946, DESCO was sold to Alfred Dorst, who expanded the company's product base of exclusively professional, commercial and military designs to supply a growing peacetime leisure market with water sports equipment. Introduced in 1947 and discontinued in 1960, the DESCO sporting goods range included regulators, masks, fins, snorkels, spearguns, aquaplanes and water-skis.

[ 4 ] DESCO published a commercial catalogue in 1949 [ 5 ] and water sports catalogues in 1949–1954, [ 6 ] 1955, [ 7 ] 1956 [ 8 ] and 1957.

[ 9 ] DESCO continues in business in Milwaukee. They produce various models of diving helmets, and related diving gear, and represent Viking Dry Suits, Composite Beat Engel DeepSea helmets, and Broco Welding.

[ 10 ] The DESCO "air hat", introduced in 1968, is still manufactured and is popular among air divers and particularly those working in contaminated environments; its free-flow, positive-pressure design affords an extra safety margin when contaminants are present. As compared to demand helmets, the air hat is simple and inexpensive to operate and maintain.

[ 11 ] In 2016, DESCO purchased the assets of Morse Diving International out of bankruptcy. They went into production of Morse Helmet models under the brand name A J Morse and Son. Current AJMS models in production are the US Navy Mark V and first generation commercial helmets in breastplate feed and bonnet feed variants. All helmets are available in polished or tinned.
