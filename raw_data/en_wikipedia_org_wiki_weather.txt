Thunderstorm near Port-la-Nouvelle, [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France "France")

**Weather** is the state of the [atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere "Atmosphere"), describing for example the degree to which it is hot or cold, wet or dry, calm or stormy, clear or [cloudy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_cover "Cloud cover").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather#cite_note-1) On [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth"), most weather phenomena occur in the lowest layer of the planet's [atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth "Atmosphere of Earth"), the [troposphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troposphere "Troposphere"),[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather#cite_note-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather#cite_note-:0-3) just below the [stratosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratosphere "Stratosphere"). Weather refers to day-to-day temperature, [precipitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precipitation "Precipitation"), and other atmospheric conditions, whereas [climate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate "Climate") is the term for the averaging of atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather#cite_note-4) When used without qualification, "weather" is generally understood to mean the weather of Earth.

Weather is driven by [air pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_pressure "Atmospheric pressure"), [temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature "Temperature"), and [moisture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moisture "Moisture") differences between one place and another. These differences can occur due to the [Sun's angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_of_Sun_angle_on_climate "Effect of Sun angle on climate") at any particular spot, which varies with [latitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude "Latitude"). The strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the largest scale [atmospheric circulations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_circulation "Atmospheric circulation"): the [Hadley cell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadley_cell "Hadley cell"), the [Ferrel cell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrel_cell "Ferrel cell"), the [polar cell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_cells "Polar cells"), and the [jet stream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_stream "Jet stream"). Weather systems in the [middle latitudes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_latitudes "Middle latitudes"), such as [extratropical cyclones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extratropical_cyclone "Extratropical cyclone"), are caused by instabilities of the jet streamflow. Because Earth's [axis is tilted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_tilt "Axial tilt") relative to its [orbital plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_plane_(astronomy) "Orbital plane (astronomy)") (called the [ecliptic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecliptic "Ecliptic")), [sunlight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunlight "Sunlight") is incident at [different angles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle_of_incidence_(optics) "Angle of incidence (optics)") at different times of the year. On Earth's surface, temperatures usually range ±40°C (−40°F to 104°F) annually. Over thousands of years, changes in Earth's [orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit "Orbit") can affect the amount and distribution of [solar energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_energy "Solar energy") received by Earth, thus influencing long-term climate and global [climate change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_variability_and_change "Climate variability and change").

Surface temperature differences in turn cause pressure differences. Higher altitudes are cooler than lower altitudes, as most atmospheric heating is due to contact with the Earth's surface while radiative losses to space are mostly constant. [Weather forecasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_forecasting "Weather forecasting") is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the [atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_atmosphere "Earth's atmosphere") for a future time and a given location. Earth's weather system is a [chaotic system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory "Chaos theory"); as a result, small changes to one part of the system can grow to have large effects on the system as a whole. Human attempts to [control the weather](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_control "Weather control") have occurred throughout history, and there is evidence that [human activities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_impact_on_the_environment "Human impact on the environment") such as agriculture and industry have modified weather patterns.

Studying how the weather works on other planets has been helpful in understanding how weather works on Earth. A famous landmark in the [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System "Solar System"), Jupiter's [Great Red Spot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Red_Spot "Great Red Spot"), is an [anticyclonic storm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticyclonic_storm "Anticyclonic storm") known to have existed for at least 300 years. However, the weather is not limited to planetary bodies. A [star's corona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_corona "Stellar corona") is constantly being lost to space, creating what is essentially a very thin atmosphere throughout the Solar System. The movement of mass ejected from the [Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun "Sun") is known as the [solar wind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_wind "Solar wind").

[Cumulonimbus cloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulonimbus_cloud "Cumulonimbus cloud") surrounded by [stratocumulus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratocumulus "Stratocumulus")

On [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth"), common [weather phenomena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_meteorological_phenomena "List of meteorological phenomena") include wind, [cloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud "Cloud"), rain, snow, [fog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fog "Fog") and [dust storms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust_storm "Dust storm"). Some more common events include [natural disasters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_disaster "Natural disaster") such as [tornadoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado "Tornado"), [hurricanes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone "Tropical cyclone"), [typhoons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoons "Typhoons") and [ice storms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_storm "Ice storm"). Almost all familiar weather phenomena occur in the troposphere (the lower part of the atmosphere).[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather#cite_note-:0-3) Weather does occur in the stratosphere and can affect weather lower down in the troposphere, but the exact mechanisms are poorly understood.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather#cite_note-5)

Weather occurs primarily due to air pressure, temperature and [moisture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moisture "Moisture") differences from one place to another. These differences can occur due to the [sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun "Sun") angle at any particular spot, which varies by latitude in the tropics. In other words, the farther from the tropics one lies, the lower the sun angle is, which causes those locations to be cooler due to the spread of the [sunlight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunlight "Sunlight") over a greater surface.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather#cite_note-6) The strong temperature contrast between [polar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_region "Polar region") and tropical air gives rise to the large scale [atmospheric circulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_circulation "Atmospheric circulation") cells and the [jet stream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_stream "Jet stream").[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather#cite_note-Stimac-7) Weather [systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems "Systems") in the mid-latitudes, such as [extratropical cyclones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extratropical_cyclone "Extratropical cyclone"), are caused by instabilities of the [jet stream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_stream "Jet stream") flow (see [baroclinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baroclinity "Baroclinity")).[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather#cite_note-8) Weather systems in the tropics, such as [monsoons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsoon "Monsoon") or organized [thunderstorm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderstorm "Thunderstorm") systems, are caused by different processes.

[![Image 5](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/16-008-NASA-2015RecordWarmGlobalYearSince1880-20160120.png/500px-16-008-NASA-2015RecordWarmGlobalYearSince1880-20160120.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:16-008-NASA-2015RecordWarmGlobalYearSince1880-20160120.png)

2015 – [5th Warmest Global Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming "Global warming") on Record (since 1880) as of 2021 – Colors indicate temperature anomalies ([NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA "NASA")/[NOAA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOAA "NOAA"); 20 January 2016).[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather#cite_note-NASA-20160120-9)

Because the Earth's [axis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_rotation "Earth's rotation") is tilted relative to its orbital plane, [sunlight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunlight "Sunlight") is incident at different angles at different times of the year. In June the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the [Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun "Sun"), so at any given Northern Hemisphere latitude sunlight falls more directly on that spot than in December (see [Effect of sun angle on climate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_of_sun_angle_on_climate "Effect of sun angle on climate")).[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather#cite_note-10) This effect causes seasons. Over thousands to hundreds of thousands of years, changes in Earth's orbital parameters affect the amount and distribution of [solar energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_energy "Solar energy") received by the [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth") and influence long-term climate. (See [Milankovitch cycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milankovitch_cycles "Milankovitch cycles")).[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather#cite_note-11)

The uneven solar heating (the formation of zones of temperature and moisture gradients, or [frontogenesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontogenesis "Frontogenesis")) can also be due to the weather itself in the form of cloudiness and precipitation.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather#cite_note-12) Higher altitudes are typically cooler than lower altitudes, which is the result of higher surface temperature and radiational heating, which produces the [adiabatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adiabatic_process "Adiabatic process")[lapse rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lapse_rate "Lapse rate").[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather#cite_note-13)[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather#cite_note-14) In some situations, the temperature actually increases with height. This phenomenon is known as an [inversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_(meteorology) "Inversion (meteorology)") and can cause mountaintops to be warmer than the valleys below. Inversions can lead to the formation of [fog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fog "Fog") and often act as a [cap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capping_inversion "Capping inversion") that [suppresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convective_inhibition "Convective inhibition") thunderstorm development. On local scales, temperature differences can occur because different surfaces (such as oceans, forests, [ice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice "Ice") sheets, or human-made objects) have differing physical characteristics such as [reflectivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albedo "Albedo"), roughness, or moisture content.

Surface temperature differences in turn cause pressure differences. A hot surface warms the air above it causing it to expand and lower the density and the resulting surface [air pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_pressure "Atmospheric pressure").[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather#cite_note-15) The resulting horizontal [pressure gradient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure_gradient_(atmospheric) "Pressure gradient (atmospheric)") moves the air from higher to lower pressure regions, creating a wind, and the Earth's rotation then causes deflection of this airflow due to the [Coriolis effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coriolis_effect "Coriolis effect").[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather#cite_note-16) The simple systems thus formed can then display [emergent behaviour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence "Emergence") to produce more [complex systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure_system "Pressure system") and thus other weather phenomena. Large scale examples include the [Hadley cell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadley_cell "Hadley cell") while a smaller scale example would be [coastal breezes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_breeze "Sea breeze").

The [atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_atmosphere "Earth's atmosphere") is a [chaotic system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory "Chaos theory"). As a result, small changes to one part of the system can accumulate and magnify to cause large effects on the system as a whole.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather#cite_note-17) This atmospheric instability makes weather forecasting less predictable than tidal waves or eclipses.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather#cite_note-Lorenz,_1969-18) Although it is difficult to accurately predict weather more than a few days in advance, [weather forecasters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_forecasting "Weather forecasting") are continually working to extend this limit through [meteorological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology "Meteorology") research and refining current methodologies in weather prediction. However, it is theoretically impossible to make useful day-to-day [predictions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictions "Predictions") more than about two weeks ahead, imposing an upper limit to [potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential "Potential") for improved prediction skill.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather#cite_note-Chaos_in_the_Atmosphere-19)

Shaping the planet Earth
------------------------

Weather is one of the fundamental processes that shape the Earth. The process of weathering breaks down the rocks and soils into smaller fragments and then into their constituent substances.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather#cite_note-20) During rains precipitation, the water droplets absorb and dissolve carbon dioxide from the surrounding air. This causes the rainwater to be slightly acidic, which aids the erosive properties of water. The released sediment and chemicals are then free to take part in [chemical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical "Chemical") reactions that can affect the surface further (such as [acid rain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_rain "Acid rain")), and sodium and chloride ions ([salt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_salt "Sea salt")) deposited in the seas/oceans. The sediment may reform in time and by geological forces into other rocks and soils. In this way, weather plays a major role in [erosion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erosion "Erosion") of the surface.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather#cite_note-21)

Effect on humans
----------------

Weather, seen from an anthropological perspective, is something all humans in the world constantly experience through their senses, at least while being outside. There are socially and scientifically constructed understandings of what weather is, what makes it change, the effect the weather, and especially **inclement weather**, has on humans in different situations, etc.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather#cite_note-22) Therefore, weather is something people often communicate about.

In the United States, the [National Weather Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Weather_Service "National Weather Service") has an annual report for fatalities, injury, and total damage costs which include crop and property. They gather this data via National Weather Service offices located throughout the 50 states in the United States as well as [Puerto Rico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rico "Puerto Rico"), [Guam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guam "Guam"), and the [Virgin Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Virgin_Islands "United States Virgin Islands"). As of 2019, tornadoes have had the greatest impact on humans with 42 fatalities while costing crop and property damage over 3 billion dollars.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather#cite_note-23)

### Effects on populations

[![Image 6](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/Navy-FloodedNewOrleans.jpg/250px-Navy-FloodedNewOrleans.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Navy-FloodedNewOrleans.jpg)

New Orleans, Louisiana, after being struck by [Hurricane Katrina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina "Hurricane Katrina"). Katrina was a [Category 3 hurricane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_3_hurricane "Category 3 hurricane") when it struck although it had been a category 5 hurricane in the [Gulf of Mexico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico "Gulf of Mexico").

The weather has played a large and sometimes direct part in [human history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_history "Human history"). Aside from [climatic changes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change "Climate change") that have caused the gradual drift of populations (for example the [desertification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desertification "Desertification") of the Middle East, and the formation of [land bridges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_bridge "Land bridge") during [glacial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glacial "Glacial") periods), [extreme weather](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_weather "Severe weather") events have caused smaller scale population movements and intruded directly in historical events. One such event is the saving of Japan from invasion by the [Mongol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongols "Mongols") fleet of [Kublai Khan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kublai_Khan "Kublai Khan") by the [Kamikaze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamikaze_(typhoon) "Kamikaze (typhoon)") winds in 1281.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather#cite_note-24) French claims to Florida came to an end in 1565 when a hurricane destroyed the French fleet, allowing Spain to conquer [Fort Caroline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Caroline "Fort Caroline").[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather#cite_note-25) More recently, [Hurricane Katrina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina "Hurricane Katrina") redistributed over one million people from the central [Gulf coast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_coast "Gulf coast") elsewhere across the United States, becoming the largest [diaspora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaspora "Diaspora") in the history of the United States.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather#cite_note-26)

The [Little Ice Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Ice_Age "Little Ice Age") caused crop failures and [famines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine "Famine") in Europe. During the period known as the [Grindelwald Fluctuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grindelwald_Fluctuation "Grindelwald Fluctuation") (1560–1630), volcanic forcing events[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather#cite_note-27) seem to have led to more extreme weather events.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather#cite_note-28) These included droughts, storms and unseasonal blizzards, as well as causing the Swiss [Grindelwald Glacier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_Grindelwald_Glacier "Lower Grindelwald Glacier") to expand. The 1690s saw the worst famine in France since the Middle Ages. Finland suffered a severe famine in 1696–1697, during which about one-third of the Finnish population died.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather#cite_note-29)

Forecasting
-----------

[![Image 7](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/Day5pressureforecast.png/250px-Day5pressureforecast.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Day5pressureforecast.png)

Forecast of surface pressures five days into the future for the north Pacific, North America, and the north Atlantic Ocean as on 9 June 2008

Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the [atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_atmosphere "Earth's atmosphere") for a future time and a given location. Human beings have attempted to predict the weather informally for millennia, and formally since at least the nineteenth century.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather#cite_note-30) Weather forecasts are made by collecting [quantitative data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_data "Quantitative data") about the current state of the atmosphere and using [scientific understanding of atmospheric processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology "Meteorology") to project how the atmosphere will evolve.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather#cite_note-31)

Once an all-human endeavor based mainly upon changes in [barometric pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_pressure "Atmospheric pressure"), current weather conditions, and sky condition,[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather#cite_note-32)[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather#cite_note-33)[forecast models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_weather_prediction "Numerical weather prediction") are now used to determine future conditions. On the other hand, human input is still required to pick the best possible forecast model to base the forecast upon, which involves many disciplines such as pattern recognition skills, [teleconnections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleconnection "Teleconnection"), knowledge of model performance, and knowledge of model biases.

The [chaotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory "Chaos theory") nature of the atmosphere, the massive computational power required to solve the equations that describe the atmosphere, the error involved in measuring the initial conditions, and an incomplete understanding of atmospheric processes mean that forecasts become less accurate as of the difference in current time and the time for which the forecast is being made (the _range_ of the forecast) increases. The use of ensembles and model consensus helps to narrow the error and pick the most likely outcome.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather#cite_note-Klaus-34)[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather#cite_note-TBK-35)[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather#cite_note-36)

There are a variety of end users to weather forecasts. Weather warnings are important forecasts because they are used to protect life and property.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather#cite_note-37)[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather#cite_note-38) Forecasts based on temperature and [precipitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precipitation_(meteorology) "Precipitation (meteorology)") are important to agriculture,[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather#cite_note-39)[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather#cite_note-40)[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather#cite_note-41)[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather#cite_note-42) and therefore to commodity traders within stock markets. Temperature forecasts are used by utility companies to estimate demand over coming days.[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather#cite_note-43)[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather#cite_note-44)[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather#cite_note-45)

In some areas, people use weather forecasts to determine what to wear on a given day. Since outdoor activities are severely curtailed by heavy [rain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain "Rain"), [snow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow "Snow") and the [wind chill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_chill "Wind chill"), forecasts can be used to plan activities around these events and to plan ahead to survive through them.

Tropical weather forecasting is different from that at higher latitudes. The sun shines more directly on the tropics than on higher latitudes (at least on average over a year), which makes the tropics warm (Stevens 2011). And, the vertical direction (up, as one stands on the Earth's surface) is perpendicular to the Earth's axis of rotation at the equator, while the axis of rotation and the vertical are the same at the pole; this causes the Earth's rotation to influence the atmospheric circulation more strongly at high latitudes than low latitudes. Because of these two factors, clouds and rainstorms in the tropics can occur more spontaneously compared to those at higher latitudes, where they are more tightly controlled by larger-scale forces in the atmosphere. Because of these differences, clouds and rain are more difficult to forecast in the tropics than at higher latitudes. On the other hand, the temperature is easily forecast in the tropics, because it does not change much.[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather#cite_note-46)

Modification
------------

The aspiration to [control the weather](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_modification "Weather modification") is evident throughout human history: from ancient rituals intended to bring rain for crops to the U.S. Military [Operation Popeye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Popeye "Operation Popeye"), an attempt to disrupt [supply lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_supply_chain_management "Military supply chain management") by lengthening the North Vietnamese [monsoon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsoon "Monsoon"). The most successful attempts at influencing weather involve [cloud seeding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_seeding "Cloud seeding"); they include the [fog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fog "Fog")- and low [stratus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratus_cloud "Stratus cloud") dispersion techniques employed by major airports, techniques used to increase [winter precipitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow "Snow") over mountains, and techniques to suppress [hail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hail "Hail").[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather#cite_note-AMS-47) A recent example of weather control was China's preparation for the [2008 Summer Olympic Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Summer_Olympics "2008 Summer Olympics"). China shot 1,104 rain dispersal rockets from 21 sites in the city of [Beijing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing "Beijing") in an effort to keep rain away from the opening ceremony of the games on 8 August 2008. Guo Hu, head of the Beijing Municipal Meteorological Bureau (BMB), confirmed the success of the operation with 100 millimeters falling in [Baoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baoding "Baoding") City of [Hebei Province](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebei_Province "Hebei Province"), to the southwest and Beijing's [Fangshan District](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fangshan_District "Fangshan District") recording a rainfall of 25 millimeters.[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather#cite_note-48)

Whereas there is inconclusive evidence for these techniques' efficacy, there is extensive evidence that human activity such as agriculture and industry results in inadvertent weather modification:[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather#cite_note-AMS-47)

Microscale meteorology
----------------------

[Microscale meteorology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscale_meteorology "Microscale meteorology") is the study of short-lived [atmospheric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_atmosphere "Earth's atmosphere") phenomena smaller than [mesoscale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoscale_meteorology "Mesoscale meteorology"), about 1 km or less. These two branches of [meteorology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology "Meteorology") are sometimes grouped together as "mesoscale and microscale meteorology" (MMM) and together study all phenomena smaller than [synoptic scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synoptic_scale_meteorology "Synoptic scale meteorology"); that is they study features generally too small to be depicted on a [weather map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_map "Weather map"). These include small and generally fleeting cloud "puffs" and other small cloud features.[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather#cite_note-52)

Extremes on Earth

 In recent decades, new high temperature records have substantially outpaced new low temperature records on a growing portion of Earth's surface[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather#cite_note-NOAA_July-53)

On Earth, temperatures usually range ±40°C (100°F to −40°F) annually. The range of climates and latitudes across the planet can offer extremes of temperature outside this range. The coldest air temperature ever recorded on Earth is −89.2°C (−128.6°F), at [Vostok Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vostok_Station "Vostok Station"), Antarctica on 21 July 1983. The hottest air temperature ever recorded was 57.7°C (135.9°F) at [ʽAziziya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CA%BDAziziya "ʽAziziya"), Libya, on 13 September 1922,[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather#cite_note-NCDC-54) but that reading was [deemed illegitimate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%27Aziziya#Geography_and_climate "'Aziziya") by the [World Meteorological Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Meteorological_Organization "World Meteorological Organization"). The highest recorded average annual temperature was 34.4°C (93.9°F) at [Dallol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallol,_Ethiopia "Dallol, Ethiopia"), Ethiopia.[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather#cite_note-55) The coldest recorded average annual temperature was −55.1°C (−67.2°F) at [Vostok Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vostok_Station "Vostok Station"), Antarctica.[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather#cite_note-56)

The coldest average annual temperature in a permanently inhabited location is at [Eureka, Nunavut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eureka,_Nunavut "Eureka, Nunavut"), in Canada, where the annual average temperature is −19.7°C (−3.5°F).[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather#cite_note-57)

The windiest place ever recorded is in Antarctica, [Commonwealth Bay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Bay "Commonwealth Bay") ([George V Coast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_V_Coast "George V Coast")). Here the gales reach 199 mph (320[km/h](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilometres_per_hour "Kilometres per hour")).[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather#cite_note-58) Furthermore, the greatest [snowfall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow "Snow") in a period of twelve [months](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Month "Month") occurred in [Mount Rainier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Rainier "Mount Rainier"), Washington, US. It was recorded as 31,102 mm (102.04 ft) of snow.[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather#cite_note-59)

[![Image 9](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/Great_Red_Spot_From_Voyager_1.jpg/250px-Great_Red_Spot_From_Voyager_1.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Great_Red_Spot_From_Voyager_1.jpg)

Jupiter's Great Red Spot in February 1979, photographed by the uncrewed _[Voyager 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager\_1 "Voyager 1")_ NASA space probe.

Studying how the weather works on other planets has been seen as helpful in understanding how it works on Earth.[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather#cite_note-60) Weather on other planets follows many of the same physical principles as weather on [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth"), but occurs on different scales and in atmospheres having different chemical composition. The _[Cassini–Huygens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini%E2%80%93Huygens "Cassini–Huygens")_ mission to [Titan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_(moon) "Titan (moon)") discovered clouds formed from methane or ethane which deposit rain composed of liquid [methane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane "Methane") and other [organic compounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_compound "Organic compound").[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather#cite_note-61) Earth's atmosphere includes six latitudinal circulation zones, three in each hemisphere.[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather#cite_note-62) In contrast, [Jupiter's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter "Jupiter") banded appearance shows many such zones,[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather#cite_note-63) Titan has a single jet stream near the 50th parallel north latitude,[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather#cite_note-64) and [Venus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus "Venus") has a single jet near the equator.[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather#cite_note-65)

One of the most famous landmarks in the [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System "Solar System"), Jupiter's [Great Red Spot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Red_Spot "Great Red Spot"), is an [anticyclonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticyclone "Anticyclone") storm known to have existed for at least 300 years.[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather#cite_note-HaydPlan-66) On other [giant planets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_planet "Giant planet"), the lack of a surface allows the wind to reach enormous speeds: gusts of up to 600 metres per second (about 2,100 km/h or 1,300 mph) have been measured on the planet [Neptune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neptune "Neptune").[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather#cite_note-Suomi1991-67) This has created a puzzle for [planetary scientists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_science "Planetary science"). The weather is ultimately created by solar energy and the amount of energy received by Neptune is only about 1⁄900 of that received by Earth, yet the intensity of weather phenomena on Neptune is far greater than on Earth.[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather#cite_note-68) As of 2007, the strongest planetary winds discovered are on the [extrasolar planet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrasolar_planet "Extrasolar planet")[HD 189733 b](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HD_189733_b "HD 189733 b"), which is thought to have easterly winds moving at more than 9,600 kilometres per hour (6,000 mph).[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather#cite_note-Knutson-69)

Space weather

[Aurora borealis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora_borealis "Aurora borealis")

Weather is not limited to planetary bodies. Like all stars, the [Sun's corona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_corona "Solar corona") is constantly being lost to space, creating what is essentially a very thin [atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere "Atmosphere") throughout the [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System "Solar System"). The movement of mass ejected from the Sun is known as the [solar wind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_wind "Solar wind"). Inconsistencies in this wind and larger events on the surface of the star, such as [coronal mass ejections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronal_mass_ejection "Coronal mass ejection"), form a system that has features analogous to conventional weather systems (such as pressure and wind) and is generally known as [space weather](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_weather "Space weather"). Coronal mass ejections have been tracked as far out in the [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System "Solar System") as [Saturn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn "Saturn").[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather#cite_note-70) The activity of this system can affect planetary [atmospheres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere "Atmosphere") and occasionally surfaces. The interaction of the [solar wind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_wind "Solar wind") with the terrestrial atmosphere can produce spectacular [aurorae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora_(astronomy) "Aurora (astronomy)"),[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather#cite_note-71) and can play havoc with electrically sensitive systems such as [electricity grids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission "Electric power transmission") and radio signals.[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather#cite_note-72)
