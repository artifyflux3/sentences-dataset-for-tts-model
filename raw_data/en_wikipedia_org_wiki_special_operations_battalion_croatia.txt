Find sources: "Special Operations Battalion" Croatia – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( April 2009 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) The Special Operations Battalion ( Croatian : Bojna za specijalna djelovanja ), [ 1 ] or popularly known as BSD , is a former Croatian special forces unit.

BSD operators can be recognized by their green berets with unit badges over the right eye. Their symbol is a snake, so they are sometimes referred as "Cobras" although their insignia shows a Horned viper which is the most dangerous snake to be found in Croatia and in mainland Europe .

History [ edit ] BSD was founded on 8 September 2000 when the Special Combat Skills Center from Šepurine and the 1st Croatian Guards Brigade ( Croatian : 1. hrvatski gardijski zdrug , a component of the 1st Croatian Guards Corps ) were amalgamated.

[ 2 ] It ceased to exist in 2014, when it was transformed into the Special Operations Command under the "Long-Term Development Plan of the Croatian Armed Forces".

[ 3 ] Main tasks [ edit ] The Battalion was focused on air assault and airborne as well as special operations behind enemy lines with insertion from sea, air, and land. However, unlike most special forces in the world, the Battalion is also trained in non-combat search and rescue of civilians and providing aid as well as dealing with natural disasters. The unit was equipped with the most sophisticated weapons and equipment available, and trained to undertake the full range of special operations missions and even the dangerous mid-air, aircraft-to-aircraft operations.
Personnel were trained for: Amphibious reconnaissance to prepare for amphibious warfare operations.

Clandestine and covert operations.

Close-quarters battle and close-quarters combat.

Combat special operations on sea, air, and land on all types of terrains and all weather conditions.

Combat search and rescue and casualty evacuation.

Deep battlefield infiltration by sea, air, and land.

Gathering field military intelligence.

Hostage rescue on all types of terrains and all weather conditions.

Humanitarian and peacekeeping operations.

Irregular warfare behind enemy lines.

Maritime counterterrorism.

Maritime interdiction operations.

Psychological warfare operations.

Providing security in areas at risk of attack or terrorism.

Rapid reaction to military emergencies as a rapid reaction force.

Search and rescue for victims of natural disasters.

Special reconnaissance in difficult to access and dangerous areas.

Support emergency management.

Underwater demolition.

Urban counterterrorism.

VIPs protection.

The Croatian General Staff exercised direct command over the battalion which thus elevated the unit to strategic level for quicker response time and overall better and faster deployment on both tactical and strategic levels. Also, this meant that members of all three branches of the Croatian armed forces could apply for selection. In 2008, two women successfully completed selection and training, earning their green berets and making the BSD one of the few special forces units in the world that have women among their ranks as combat qualified operators and not just support staff.

Structure of BSD [ edit ] The BSD was composed of one command section and five companies, each  specialized for a different variety of missions: Command Section - responsible for command, control and communications, intelligence, logistics, medical personnel, supplies, and transport 1st Special Operations Company - specialized for air assault and airborne (including pathfinder) operations in the event of an emergency requiring military force as a rapid reaction force (RRF) 2nd Special Operations Company - specialized for clandestine operations, combat search and rescue, counterinsurgency, direct action, irregular warfare, jungle warfare, long-range penetration, mountain rescue, mountain warfare, and special reconnaissance.

3rd Special Operations Company - specialized for amphibious reconnaissance, amphibious warfare, clandestine operations, direct action, long-range penetration, maritime counterterrorism, maritime search and rescue, naval boarding, naval special warfare, special reconnaissance, underwater demolition, and VIPs protection.

4th Special Operations Company - specialized for clandestine operations, direct action, hostage rescue, irregular warfare, long-range penetration, special reconnaissance, urban counterterrorism and urban warfare, urban rescue, and VIPs protection.

Fire Support Company - specialized for counter-sniper/sniper and mortar training and fire support with snipers to other four BSD companies.
