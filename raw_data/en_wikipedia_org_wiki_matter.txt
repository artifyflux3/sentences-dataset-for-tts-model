[Hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen "Hydrogen") in its [plasma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics) "Plasma (physics)") state is the most abundant ordinary matter in the universe.

In [classical physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_physics "Classical physics") and general [chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry "Chemistry"), **matter** is any substance that has [mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass "Mass") and takes up space by having [volume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume "Volume").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-Penrose-1) All everyday objects that can be touched are ultimately composed of [atoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom "Atom"), which are made up of interacting [subatomic particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subatomic_particle "Subatomic particle"). In everyday as well as scientific usage, _matter_ generally includes [atoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atoms "Atoms") and anything made up of them, and any particles (or [combination of particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_particle "Composite particle")) that act as if they have both [rest mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rest_mass "Rest mass") and [volume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume "Volume"). However it does not include [massless particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massless_particle "Massless particle") such as [photons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon "Photon"), or other energy phenomena or waves such as [light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light "Light") or [heat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat "Heat").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-Penrose-1): 21 [[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-mcgrawhill-2) Matter exists in various [states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_matter "State of matter") (also known as [phases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter) "Phase (matter)")). These include classical everyday phases such as [solid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid "Solid"), [liquid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid "Liquid"), and [gas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas "Gas") – for example [water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water "Water") exists as [ice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice "Ice"), liquid water, and gaseous [steam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam "Steam") – but other states are possible, including [plasma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics) "Plasma (physics)"), [Bose–Einstein condensates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bose%E2%80%93Einstein_condensate "Bose–Einstein condensate"), [fermionic condensates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermionic_condensate "Fermionic condensate"), and [quark–gluon plasma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark%E2%80%93gluon_plasma "Quark–gluon plasma").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-RHIC-3)

Usually atoms can be imagined as a [nucleus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_nucleus "Atomic nucleus") of [protons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton "Proton") and [neutrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron "Neutron"), and a surrounding "cloud" of orbiting [electrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron "Electron") which "take up space".[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-Davies2-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-Hooft-5) However, this is only somewhat correct because subatomic particles and their properties are governed by their [quantum nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics"), which means they do not act as everyday objects appear to act – they can act like [waves as well as particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave%E2%80%93particle_duality "Wave–particle duality"), and they do not have well-defined sizes or positions. In the [Standard Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model "Standard Model") of [particle physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics "Particle physics"), matter is not a fundamental concept because the [elementary constituents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_particle "Elementary particle") of atoms are [quantum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum "Quantum") entities which do not have an inherent "size" or "[volume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume "Volume")" in any everyday sense of the word. Due to the [exclusion principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_exclusion_principle "Pauli exclusion principle") and other [fundamental interactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_interaction "Fundamental interaction"), some "[point particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_particle "Point particle")" known as [fermions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermion "Fermion") ([quarks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark "Quark"), [leptons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lepton "Lepton")), and many composites and atoms, are effectively forced to keep a distance from other particles under everyday conditions; this creates the property of matter which appears to us as matter taking up space.

For much of the history of the [natural sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_science "Natural science"), people have contemplated the exact nature of matter. The idea that matter was built of discrete building blocks, the so-called [particulate theory of matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particulate_theory_of_matter "Particulate theory of matter"), appeared in both [ancient Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece "Ancient Greece") and [ancient India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_India "Ancient India").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-Pullman2001p77-6) Early [philosophers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosopher "Philosopher") who proposed the particulate theory of matter include the Indian philosopher [Kaṇāda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ka%E1%B9%87%C4%81da "Kaṇāda") (c. 6th century BCE),[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-Fowler2002-7) and the [pre-Socratic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-Socratic_philosophy "Pre-Socratic philosophy") Greek philosophers [Leucippus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leucippus "Leucippus") (c. 490 BCE) and [Democritus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democritus "Democritus") (c. 470–380 BCE).[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-8)

### Comparison with mass

_Matter_ is a general term describing any physical substance, which is sometimes defined in incompatible ways in different fields of science. Some definitions are based on historical usage from a time when there was no reason to distinguish mass from simply a [quantity of matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantity_of_matter "Quantity of matter"). By contrast, [mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass "Mass") is not a substance but a well-defined, [extensive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_and_extensive_properties "Intensive and extensive properties") property of matter and other substances or systems. Various types of mass are defined within [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics")– including [rest mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rest_mass "Rest mass"), [inertial mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_mass "Inertial mass"), and [relativistic mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativistic_mass "Relativistic mass").

In physics, matter is sometimes equated with particles that exhibit rest mass (i.e., that cannot travel at the speed of light), such as quarks and leptons. However, in both physics and chemistry, matter exhibits both [wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave "Wave")-like and [particle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle "Particle")-like properties (the so-called [wave–particle duality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave%E2%80%93particle_duality "Wave–particle duality")).[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-Davies-9)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-Weinberg-10)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-Masujima-11)

### Relation with chemical substance

Steam and liquid water are two different forms of the same pure chemical substance, water.

Picture of a formed molecule

A [chemical substance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance "Chemical substance") is a unique form of matter with constant [chemical composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_composition "Chemical composition") and characteristic [properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_property "Chemical property").[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-12)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-13) Chemical substances may take the form of a single [element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element "Chemical element") or [chemical compounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound "Chemical compound"). If two or more chemical substances can be combined without [reacting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction "Chemical reaction"), they may form a chemical [mixture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixture "Mixture").[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-14) If a mixture is separated to isolate one chemical substance to a desired degree, the resulting substance is said to be [chemically pure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_purity "Chemical purity").[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-15)

Chemical substances can exist in several different physical [states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_matter "State of matter") or [phases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter) "Phase (matter)") (e.g. [solids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid "Solid"), [liquids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid "Liquid"), [gases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas "Gas"), or [plasma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics) "Plasma (physics)")) without changing their chemical composition. Substances [transition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_transition "Phase transition") between these [phases of matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phases_of_matter "Phases of matter") in response to changes in [temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature "Temperature") or [pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure "Pressure"). Some chemical substances can be combined or converted into new substances by means of [chemical reactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction "Chemical reaction"). Chemicals that do not possess this ability are said to be [inert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inert_gas "Inert gas").

Pure [water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_(molecule) "Water (molecule)") is an example of a chemical substance, with a constant composition of two hydrogen [atoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom "Atom")[bonded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_bond "Chemical bond") to a single oxygen atom (i.e. H 2 O). The [atomic ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_ratio "Atomic ratio") of hydrogen to oxygen is always 2:1 in every [molecule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule "Molecule") of water. Pure water will tend to [boil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_point "Boiling point") near 100°C (212°F), an example of one of the characteristic properties that define it. Other notable chemical substances include [diamond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond "Diamond") (a form of the element [carbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon "Carbon")), [table salt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_chloride "Sodium chloride") (NaCl; an [ionic compound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionic_compound "Ionic compound")), and refined [sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sucrose "Sucrose") (C 12 H 22 O 11; an [organic compound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_compound "Organic compound")).

Definition
----------

### Based on atoms

A definition of "matter" based on its physical and chemical structure is: _matter is made up of [atoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom "Atom")_.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-Barker0-16) Such _atomic matter_ is also sometimes termed _ordinary matter_. As an example, [deoxyribonucleic acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deoxyribonucleic_acid "Deoxyribonucleic acid")[molecules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule "Molecule") (DNA) are matter under this definition because they are made of atoms. This definition can be extended to include charged atoms and molecules, so as to include [plasmas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics) "Plasma (physics)") (gases of ions) and [electrolytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolyte "Electrolyte") (ionic solutions), which are not obviously included in the atoms definition. Alternatively, one can adopt the _protons, neutrons, and electrons_ definition.

### Based on protons, neutrons and electrons

A definition of "matter" more fine-scale than the atoms and molecules definition is: _matter is made up of what [atoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom "Atom") and [molecules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule "Molecule") are made of_, meaning anything made of positively charged [protons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton "Proton"), neutral [neutrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron "Neutron"), and negatively charged [electrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron "Electron").[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-DePodesta1-17) This definition goes beyond atoms and molecules, however, to include substances made from these building blocks that are _not_ simply atoms or molecules, for example, electron beams in an old [cathode ray tube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode_ray_tube "Cathode ray tube") television, or [white dwarf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_dwarf "White dwarf") matter—typically, carbon and oxygen nuclei in a sea of degenerate electrons. At a microscopic level, the constituent "particles" of matter such as protons, neutrons, and electrons obey the laws of quantum mechanics and exhibit wave-particle duality. At an even deeper level, protons and neutrons are made up of [quarks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark "Quark") and the force fields ([gluons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluon "Gluon")) that bind them together, leading to the next definition.

### Based on quarks and leptons

[![Image 4](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Standard_Model_of_Elementary_Particles.svg/500px-Standard_Model_of_Elementary_Particles.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Standard_Model_of_Elementary_Particles.svg)

Under the "quarks and leptons" definition, the elementary and composite particles made of the [quarks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarks "Quarks") (in purple) and [leptons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leptons "Leptons") (in green) would be matter—while the gauge bosons (in red) would not be matter. However, interaction energy inherent to composite particles (for example, gluons involved in neutrons and protons) contribute to the mass of ordinary matter.

As seen in the above discussion, many early definitions of what can be called "ordinary matter" were based on its structure or "building blocks". On the scale of elementary particles, a definition that follows this tradition can be stated as: "ordinary matter is everything that is composed of [quarks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark "Quark") and [leptons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lepton "Lepton")", or "ordinary matter is everything that is composed of any elementary fermions except antiquarks and antileptons".[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-Povh0-18)[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-Carithers-19)[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-20) The connection between these formulations follows.

Leptons (the most famous being the [electron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron "Electron")), and quarks (of which [baryons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baryons "Baryons"), such as [protons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protons "Protons") and [neutrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrons "Neutrons"), are made) combine to form [atoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atoms "Atoms"), which in turn form [molecules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecules "Molecules"). Because atoms and molecules are said to be matter, it is natural to phrase the definition as: "ordinary matter is anything that is made of the same things that atoms and molecules are made of". (However, notice that one also can make from these building blocks matter that is _not_ atoms or molecules.) Then, because electrons are leptons, and protons and neutrons are made of quarks, this definition in turn leads to the definition of matter as being "quarks and leptons", which are two of the four types of elementary fermions (the other two being antiquarks and antileptons, which can be considered antimatter as described later). Carithers and Grannis state: "Ordinary matter is composed entirely of [first-generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_(physics) "Generation (physics)") particles, namely the [up] and [down] quarks, plus the electron and its neutrino."[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-Carithers-19) (Higher generations particles quickly decay into first-generation particles, and thus are not commonly encountered.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-Green2005-21))

This definition of ordinary matter is more subtle than it first appears. All the particles that make up ordinary matter (leptons and quarks) are elementary fermions, while all the [force carriers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_carriers "Force carriers") are elementary bosons.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-Smolin-22) The [W and Z bosons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W_and_Z_bosons "W and Z bosons") that mediate the [weak force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_force "Weak force") are not made of quarks or leptons, and so are not ordinary matter, even if they have mass.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-Caso-23) In other words, [mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass "Mass") is not something that is exclusive to ordinary matter.

The quark–lepton definition of ordinary matter, however, identifies not only the elementary building blocks of matter, but also includes composites made from the constituents (atoms and molecules, for example). Such composites contain an interaction energy that holds the constituents together, and may constitute the bulk of the mass of the composite. As an example, to a great extent, the mass of an atom is simply the sum of the masses of its constituent protons, neutrons and electrons. However, digging deeper, the protons and neutrons are made up of quarks bound together by gluon fields (see [dynamics of quantum chromodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_chromodynamics#Dynamics "Quantum chromodynamics")) and these gluon fields contribute significantly to the mass of hadrons.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-Aitchison-24) In other words, most of what composes the "mass" of ordinary matter is due to the [binding energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_energy "Binding energy") of quarks within protons and neutrons.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-Povh-25) For example, the sum of the mass of the three quarks in a [nucleon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleon "Nucleon") is approximately 12.5[MeV/_c_ 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronvolt#Mass "Electronvolt"), which is low compared to the mass of a nucleon (approximately 938[MeV/_c_ 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronvolt#Mass "Electronvolt")).[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-Green2004-26)[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-Akai-27) The bottom line is that most of the mass of everyday objects comes from the interaction energy of its elementary components.

The Standard Model groups matter particles into three generations, where each generation consists of two quarks and two leptons. The first generation is the _[up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up\_quark "Up quark")_ and _[down](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down\_quark "Down quark")_ quarks, the _[electron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron "Electron")_ and the _[electron neutrino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron\_neutrino "Electron neutrino")_; the second includes the _[charm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charm\_quark "Charm quark")_ and _[strange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange\_quark "Strange quark")_ quarks, the _[muon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muon "Muon")_ and the _[muon neutrino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muon\_neutrino "Muon neutrino")_; the third generation consists of the _[top](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top\_quark "Top quark")_ and _[bottom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottom\_quark "Bottom quark")_ quarks and the _[tau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tau\_(particle) "Tau (particle)")_ and _[tau neutrino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tau\_neutrino "Tau neutrino")_.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-Staley-28) The most natural explanation for this would be that quarks and leptons of higher generations are [excited states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excited_state "Excited state") of the first generations. If this turns out to be the case, it would imply that quarks and leptons are [composite particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_particle "Composite particle"), rather than [elementary particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_particle "Elementary particle").[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-Kirsh-29)

This quark–lepton definition of matter also leads to what can be described as "conservation of (net) matter" laws—discussed later below. Alternatively, one could return to the mass–volume–space concept of matter, leading to the next definition, in which antimatter becomes included as a subclass of matter.

### Based on elementary fermions (mass, volume, and space)

A common or traditional definition of matter is "anything that has [mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass "Mass") and [volume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume "Volume") (occupies [space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space "Space"))".[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-Walker-30)[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-Hage-31) For example, a car would be said to be made of matter, as it has mass and volume (occupies space).

The observation that matter occupies space goes back to antiquity. However, an explanation for why matter occupies space is recent, and is argued to be a result of the phenomenon described in the [Pauli exclusion principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_exclusion_principle "Pauli exclusion principle"),[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-Peacock-32)[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-Kreiger-33) which applies to [fermions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermions "Fermions"). Two particular examples where the exclusion principle clearly relates matter to the occupation of space are white dwarf stars and neutron stars, discussed further below.

Thus, matter can be defined as everything composed of elementary fermions. Although we do not encounter them in everyday life, antiquarks (such as the [antiproton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiproton "Antiproton")) and antileptons (such as the [positron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron "Positron")) are the [antiparticles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiparticle "Antiparticle") of the quark and the lepton, are elementary fermions as well, and have essentially the same properties as quarks and leptons, including the applicability of the Pauli exclusion principle which can be said to prevent two particles from being in the same place at the same time (in the same state), i.e. makes each particle "take up space". This particular definition leads to matter being defined to include anything made of these [antimatter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimatter "Antimatter") particles as well as the ordinary quark and lepton, and thus also anything made of [mesons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meson "Meson"), which are unstable particles made up of a quark and an antiquark.

### In general relativity and cosmology

In the context of [relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_relativity "Theory of relativity"), mass is not an additive quantity, in the sense that one cannot add the rest masses of particles in a system to get the total rest mass of the system.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-Penrose-1): 21  In relativity, usually a more general view is that it is not the sum of [rest masses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rest_mass "Rest mass"), but the [energy–momentum tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress%E2%80%93energy_tensor "Stress–energy tensor") that quantifies the amount of matter. This tensor gives the rest mass for the entire system. Matter, therefore, is sometimes considered as anything that contributes to the energy–momentum of a system, that is, anything that is not purely gravity.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-Caroll-34)[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-Davies499-35) This view is commonly held in fields that deal with [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity") such as [cosmology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology "Cosmology"). In this view, light and other massless particles and fields are all part of matter.

Structure
---------

In particle physics, fermions are particles that obey [Fermi–Dirac statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi%E2%80%93Dirac_statistics "Fermi–Dirac statistics"). Fermions can be elementary, like the electron—or composite, like the proton and neutron. In the [Standard Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model "Standard Model"), there are two types of elementary fermions: quarks and leptons, which are discussed next.

### Quarks

Quarks are [massive particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_particle "Massive particle") of [spin-1⁄2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermion "Fermion"), implying that they are [fermions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermion "Fermion"). They carry an [electric charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge "Electric charge") of −1⁄3 _[e](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary\_charge "Elementary charge")_ (down-type quarks) or +2⁄3 _e_ (up-type quarks). For comparison, an electron has a charge of −1 _e_. They also carry [colour charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colour_charge "Colour charge"), which is the equivalent of the electric charge for the [strong interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_interaction "Strong interaction"). Quarks also undergo [radioactive decay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay "Radioactive decay"), meaning that they are subject to the [weak interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_interaction "Weak interaction").

[![Image 5](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Quark_structure_proton.svg/250px-Quark_structure_proton.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Quark_structure_proton.svg)

Quark structure of a proton: 2 up quarks and 1 down quark.

Baryons are strongly interacting fermions, and so are subject to Fermi–Dirac statistics. Amongst the baryons are the protons and neutrons, which occur in atomic nuclei, but many other unstable baryons exist as well. The term baryon usually refers to triquarks—particles made of three quarks. Also, "exotic" baryons made of four quarks and one antiquark are known as [pentaquarks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentaquark "Pentaquark"), but their existence is not generally accepted.

Baryonic matter is the part of the universe that is made of baryons (including all atoms). This part of the universe does not include [dark energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_energy "Dark energy"), [dark matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter "Dark matter"), [black holes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_holes "Black holes") or various forms of degenerate matter, such as those that compose [white dwarf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_dwarf "White dwarf") stars and [neutron stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_star "Neutron star"). Microwave light seen by [Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilkinson_Microwave_Anisotropy_Probe "Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe") (WMAP) suggests that only about 4.6% of that part of the universe within range of the best [telescopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telescope "Telescope") (that is, matter that may be visible because light could reach us from it) is made of baryonic matter. About 26.8% is dark matter, and about 68.3% is dark energy.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-NASA_Science_Dark_Matter-37)

The great majority of ordinary matter in the universe is unseen, since visible stars and gas inside galaxies and clusters account for less than 10 per cent of the ordinary matter contribution to the mass–energy density of the universe.[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-38)

#### Hadronic

Hadronic matter can refer to 'ordinary' baryonic matter, made from [hadrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadron "Hadron") (baryons and [mesons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meson "Meson")), or [quark matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark_matter "Quark matter") (a generalisation of atomic nuclei), i.e. the 'low' temperature [QCD matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QCD_matter "QCD matter").[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-39) It includes [degenerate matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerate_matter "Degenerate matter") and the result of high energy heavy nuclei collisions.[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-40)

#### Degenerate

In physics, _degenerate matter_ refers to the ground state of a gas of fermions at a temperature near absolute zero.[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-Goldberg0-41) The [Pauli exclusion principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_exclusion_principle "Pauli exclusion principle") requires that only two fermions can occupy a quantum state, one spin-up and the other spin-down. Hence, at zero temperature, the fermions fill up sufficient levels to accommodate all the available fermions—and in the case of many fermions, the maximum kinetic energy (called the _[Fermi energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi\_energy "Fermi energy")_) and the pressure of the gas becomes very large, and depends on the number of fermions rather than the temperature, unlike normal states of matter.

Degenerate matter is thought to occur during the evolution of heavy stars.[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-Goldberg1-42) The demonstration by [Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subrahmanyan_Chandrasekhar "Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar") that [white dwarf stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_dwarf_star "White dwarf star") have a maximum allowed mass because of the exclusion principle caused a revolution in the theory of star evolution.[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-Luminet-43)

Degenerate matter includes the part of the universe that is made up of neutron stars and white dwarfs.

#### Strange

_Strange matter_ is a particular form of [quark matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark_matter "Quark matter"), usually thought of as a _liquid_ of [up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_quark "Up quark"), [down](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_quark "Down quark"), and [strange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_quark "Strange quark") quarks. It is contrasted with [nuclear matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_matter "Nuclear matter"), which is a liquid of [neutrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron "Neutron") and [protons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton "Proton") (which themselves are built out of up and down quarks), and with non-strange quark matter, which is a quark liquid that contains only up and down quarks. At high enough density, strange matter is expected to be [color superconducting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_superconductor "Color superconductor"). Strange matter is hypothesized to occur in the core of [neutron stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_star "Neutron star"), or, more speculatively, as isolated droplets that may vary in size from [femtometers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femtometer "Femtometer") ([strangelets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strangelet "Strangelet")) to kilometers ([quark stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark_star "Quark star")).

##### Two meanings

In [particle physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics "Particle physics") and [astrophysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics "Astrophysics"), the term is used in two ways, one broader and the other more specific.

1.   The broader meaning is just quark matter that contains three flavors of quarks: up, down, and strange. In this definition, there is a critical pressure and an associated critical density, and when nuclear matter (made of [protons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protons "Protons") and [neutrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrons "Neutrons")) is compressed beyond this density, the protons and neutrons dissociate into quarks, yielding quark matter (probably strange matter).
2.   The narrower meaning is quark matter that is _more stable than nuclear matter_. The idea that this could happen is the "strange matter hypothesis" of Bodmer[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-44) and Witten.[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-45) In this definition, the critical pressure is zero: the true ground state of matter is _always_ quark matter. The nuclei that we see in the matter around us, which are droplets of nuclear matter, are actually [metastable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastable "Metastable"), and given enough time (or the right external stimulus) would decay into droplets of strange matter, i.e. [strangelets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strangelet "Strangelet").

### Leptons

Leptons are particles of [spin-1⁄2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermion "Fermion"), meaning that they are [fermions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermion "Fermion"). They carry an [electric charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge "Electric charge") of −1 _[e](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary\_charge "Elementary charge")_ (charged leptons) or 0 _e_ (neutrinos). Unlike quarks, leptons do not carry [colour charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colour_charge "Colour charge"), meaning that they do not experience the [strong interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_interaction "Strong interaction"). Leptons also undergo radioactive decay, meaning that they are subject to the [weak interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_interaction "Weak interaction"). Leptons are massive particles, therefore are subject to gravity.

Phases
------

[![Image 6](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/Phase_diagram_for_pure_substance.JPG/330px-Phase_diagram_for_pure_substance.JPG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Phase_diagram_for_pure_substance.JPG)

[Phase diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_diagram "Phase diagram") for a typical substance at a fixed volume

In [bulk](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bulk "wikt:bulk"), matter can exist in several different forms, or states of aggregation, known as _[phases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase\_(matter) "Phase (matter)")_,[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-Collings-48) depending on ambient [pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure "Pressure"), [temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature "Temperature") and [volume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume "Volume").[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-Trevena-49) A phase is a form of matter that has a relatively uniform chemical composition and physical properties (such as [density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density "Density"), [specific heat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_heat "Specific heat"), [refractive index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractive_index "Refractive index"), and so forth). These phases include the three familiar ones ([solids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid "Solid"), [liquids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid "Liquid"), and [gases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas "Gas")), as well as more exotic states of matter (such as [plasmas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics) "Plasma (physics)"), [superfluids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superfluid "Superfluid"), [supersolids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersolid "Supersolid"), [Bose–Einstein condensates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bose%E2%80%93Einstein_condensate "Bose–Einstein condensate"), ...). A _[fluid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid "Fluid")_ may be a liquid, gas or plasma. There are also [paramagnetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramagnetism "Paramagnetism") and [ferromagnetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferromagnetism "Ferromagnetism") phases of [magnetic materials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_material "Magnetic material"). As conditions change, matter may change from one phase into another. These phenomena are called [phase transitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_transition "Phase transition") and are studied in the field of [thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamics "Thermodynamics"). In nanomaterials, the vastly increased ratio of surface area to volume results in matter that can exhibit properties entirely different from those of bulk material, and not well described by any bulk phase (see [nanomaterials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanomaterials "Nanomaterials") for more details).

Phases are sometimes called _states of matter_, but this term can lead to confusion with [thermodynamic states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamics "Thermodynamics"). For example, two gases maintained at different pressures are in different _thermodynamic states_ (different pressures), but in the same _phase_ (both are gases).

Antimatter
----------

Unsolved problem in physics

[Baryon asymmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baryon_asymmetry "Baryon asymmetry"). Why is there far more matter than antimatter in the observable universe?

_Antimatter_ is matter that is composed of the [antiparticles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiparticle "Antiparticle") of those that constitute ordinary matter. If a particle and its antiparticle come into contact with each other, the two [annihilate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annihilation "Annihilation"); that is, they may both be converted into other particles with equal [energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy "Energy") in accordance with [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein")'s equation [_E_ = _mc_ 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E%3DMC2 "E=MC2"). These new particles may be high-energy [photons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon "Photon") ([gamma rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_ray "Gamma ray")) or other particle–antiparticle pairs. The resulting particles are endowed with an amount of kinetic energy equal to the difference between the [rest mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rest_mass "Rest mass") of the products of the annihilation and the rest mass of the original particle–antiparticle pair, which is often quite large. Depending on which definition of "matter" is adopted, antimatter can be said to be a particular subclass of matter, or the opposite of matter.

Antimatter is not found naturally on Earth, except very briefly and in vanishingly small quantities (as the result of [radioactive decay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay "Radioactive decay"), [lightning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning "Lightning") or [cosmic rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_ray "Cosmic ray")). This is because antimatter that came to exist on Earth outside the confines of a suitable physics laboratory would almost instantly meet the ordinary matter that Earth is made of, and be annihilated. Antiparticles and some stable antimatter (such as [antihydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antihydrogen "Antihydrogen")) can be made in tiny amounts, but not in enough quantity to do more than test a few of its theoretical properties.

There is considerable speculation both in [science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science "Science") and [science fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction "Science fiction") as to why the observable universe is apparently almost entirely matter (in the sense of quarks and leptons but not antiquarks or antileptons), and whether other places are almost entirely antimatter (antiquarks and antileptons) instead. In the early universe, it is thought that matter and antimatter were equally represented, and the disappearance of antimatter requires an asymmetry in physical laws called [CP (charge–parity) symmetry violation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP_violation "CP violation"), which can be obtained from the Standard Model,[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-CP-50) but at this time the apparent [asymmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetry "Asymmetry") of matter and antimatter in the visible universe is one of the great [unsolved problems in physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsolved_problems_in_physics "Unsolved problems in physics"). Possible processes by which it came about are explored in more detail under [baryogenesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baryogenesis "Baryogenesis").

Formally, antimatter particles can be defined by their negative [baryon number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baryon_number "Baryon number") or [lepton number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lepton_number "Lepton number"), while "normal" (non-antimatter) matter particles have positive baryon or lepton number.[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-51) These two classes of particles are the antiparticle partners of one another.

In October 2017, scientists reported further evidence that matter and [antimatter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimatter "Antimatter"), equally produced at the [Big Bang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang "Big Bang"), are identical, should completely annihilate each other and, as a result, the [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe "Universe") should not exist.[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-NAT-20171020-52) This implies that there must be something, as yet unknown to scientists, that either stopped the complete mutual destruction of matter and antimatter in the early forming universe, or that gave rise to an imbalance between the two forms.

Conservation
------------

Two quantities that can define an amount of matter in the quark–lepton sense (and antimatter in an antiquark–antilepton sense), [baryon number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baryon_number "Baryon number") and [lepton number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lepton_number "Lepton number"), are [conserved](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_law "Conservation law") in the Standard Model. A [baryon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baryon "Baryon") such as the proton or neutron has a baryon number of one, and a quark, because there are three in a baryon, is given a baryon number of 1/3. So the net amount of matter, as measured by the number of quarks (minus the number of antiquarks, which each have a baryon number of −1/3), which is proportional to baryon number, and number of leptons (minus antileptons), which is called the lepton number, is practically impossible to change in any process. Even in a nuclear bomb, none of the baryons (protons and neutrons of which the atomic nuclei are composed) are destroyed—there are as many baryons after as before the reaction, so none of these matter particles are actually destroyed and none are even converted to non-matter particles (like photons of light or radiation). Instead, [nuclear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_binding_energy "Nuclear binding energy") (and perhaps [chromodynamic) binding energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_chromodynamics_binding_energy "Quantum chromodynamics binding energy") is released, as these baryons become bound into mid-size nuclei having less energy (and, [equivalently](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass%E2%80%93energy_equivalence "Mass–energy equivalence"), less [mass) per nucleon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_per_nucleon "Mass per nucleon") compared to the original small (hydrogen) and large (plutonium etc.) nuclei. Even in [electron–positron annihilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron%E2%80%93positron_annihilation "Electron–positron annihilation"), there is no net matter being destroyed, because there was zero net matter (zero total lepton number and baryon number) to begin with before the annihilation—one lepton minus one antilepton equals zero net lepton number—and this net amount matter does not change as it simply remains zero after the annihilation.[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-53)

In short, matter, as defined in physics, refers to baryons and leptons. The amount of matter is defined in terms of baryon and lepton number. Baryons and leptons can be created, but their creation is accompanied by antibaryons or antileptons; and they can be destroyed by annihilating them with antibaryons or antileptons. Since antibaryons/antileptons have negative baryon/lepton numbers, the overall baryon/lepton numbers are not changed, so matter is conserved. However, baryons/leptons and antibaryons/antileptons all have positive mass, so the total amount of mass is not conserved. Further, outside of natural or artificial nuclear reactions, there is almost no antimatter generally available in the universe (see [baryon asymmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baryon_asymmetry "Baryon asymmetry") and [leptogenesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leptogenesis_(physics) "Leptogenesis (physics)")), so particle annihilation is rare in normal circumstances.

Dark
----

Pie chart showing the fractions of energy in the universe contributed by different sources. _Ordinary matter_ is divided into _luminous matter_ (the stars and luminous gases and 0.005% radiation) and _nonluminous matter_ (intergalactic gas and about 0.1% neutrinos and 0.04% supermassive black holes). Ordinary matter is uncommon. Modeled after Ostriker and Steinhardt.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-Ostriker-54) For more information, see [NASA](https://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/news/index.html).

1.   Dark energy (73.0%)
2.   Dark matter (23.0%)
3.   Non-luminous matter (3.60%)
4.   Luminous matter (0.40%)

Ordinary matter, in the quarks and leptons definition, constitutes about 4% of the [energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass%E2%80%93energy_equivalence "Mass–energy equivalence") of the [observable universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe "Observable universe"). The remaining energy is theorized to be due to exotic forms, of which 23% is [dark matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter "Dark matter")[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-Pretzl-55)[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-Freeman-56) and 73% is [dark energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_energy "Dark energy").[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-Wheeler0-57)[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-Gribbin-58)

[![Image 7](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Rotation_curve_%28Milky_Way%29.svg/330px-Rotation_curve_%28Milky_Way%29.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Rotation_curve_(Milky_Way).svg)

[Galaxy rotation curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_rotation_curve "Galaxy rotation curve") for the Milky Way. Vertical axis is speed of rotation about the galactic center. Horizontal axis is distance from the galactic center. The sun is marked with a yellow ball. The observed curve of speed of rotation is blue. The predicted curve based upon stellar mass and gas in the Milky Way is red. The difference is due to [dark matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter "Dark matter") or perhaps a modification of the [law of gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOND "MOND").[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-Schneider-59)[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-Koupelis-60)[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-Jones-61) Scatter in observations is indicated roughly by gray bars.

In [astrophysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics "Astrophysics") and [cosmology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology "Cosmology"), _dark matter_ is matter of unknown composition that does not emit or reflect enough electromagnetic radiation to be observed directly, but whose presence can be inferred from gravitational effects on visible matter.[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-Majumdar-62)[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-Olive-63) Observational evidence of the early universe and the [Big Bang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang "Big Bang") theory require that this matter have energy and mass, but not be composed of ordinary baryons (protons and neutrons). The commonly accepted view is that most of the dark matter is [non-baryonic in nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonbaryonic_dark_matter "Nonbaryonic dark matter").[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-Majumdar-62) As such, it is composed of particles as yet unobserved in the laboratory. Perhaps they are [supersymmetric particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersymmetry "Supersymmetry"),[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-Olive2-64) which are not [Standard Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model "Standard Model") particles but relics formed at very high energies in the early phase of the universe and still floating about.[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-Majumdar-62)

### Energy

In [cosmology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology "Cosmology"), _dark energy_ is the name given to the source of the repelling influence that is accelerating the rate of [expansion of the universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansion_of_the_universe "Expansion of the universe"). Its precise nature is currently a mystery, although its effects can reasonably be modeled by assigning matter-like properties such as energy density and pressure to the [vacuum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum "Vacuum") itself.[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-Wheeler1-65)[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-Smolin2-66)

> Fully 70% of the matter density in the universe appears to be in the form of dark energy. Twenty-six percent is dark matter. Only 4% is ordinary matter. So less than 1 part in 20 is made out of matter we have observed experimentally or described in the [standard model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_model "Standard model") of particle physics. Of the other 96%, apart from the properties just mentioned, we know absolutely nothing.

— [Lee Smolin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Smolin "Lee Smolin") (2007), _The Trouble with Physics_, p. 16

Exotic
------

Exotic matter is a concept of [particle physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics "Particle physics"), which may include dark matter and dark energy but goes further to include any hypothetical material that violates one or more of the properties of known forms of matter. Some such materials might possess hypothetical properties like [negative mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_mass "Negative mass").

Historical and philosophical study
----------------------------------

The modern conception of matter has been refined many times in history, in light of the improvement in knowledge of just _what_ the basic building blocks are, and in how they interact. The term "matter" is used throughout physics in a wide variety of contexts: for example, one refers to "[condensed matter physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condensed_matter_physics "Condensed matter physics")",[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-Chaikin-67) "elementary matter",[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-Greiner-68) "[partonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parton_(particle_physics) "Parton (particle physics)")" matter, "[dark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter "Dark matter")" matter, "[anti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimatter "Antimatter")"-matter, "[strange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_matter "Strange matter")" matter, and "[nuclear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_matter "Nuclear matter")" matter. In discussions of matter and [antimatter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimatter "Antimatter"), the former has been referred to by [Alfvén](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannes_Alfv%C3%A9n "Hannes Alfvén") as _koinomatter_ (Gk. _common matter_).[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-69) In [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics"), there is no broad consensus as to a general definition of matter, and the term "matter" usually is used in conjunction with a specifying modifier.

The history of the concept of matter is a history of the fundamental _length scales_ used to define matter. Different building blocks apply depending upon whether one defines matter on an atomic or elementary particle level. One may use a definition that matter is atoms, or that matter is [hadrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadron "Hadron"), or that matter is leptons and quarks depending upon the scale at which one wishes to define matter.[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-70)

### Classical antiquity

In [ancient India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_India "Ancient India"), the [Buddhist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist_philosophy "Buddhist philosophy"), [Hindu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_philosophy "Hindu philosophy"), and [Jain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jain_philosophy "Jain philosophy") philosophical traditions each posited that [matter was made of atoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomism "Atomism") (_paramanu_, _pudgala_) that were "eternal, indestructible, without parts, and innumerable" and which associated or dissociated to form more complex matter according to the [laws of nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_law "Scientific law").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-Pullman2001p77-6) They coupled their ideas of soul, or lack thereof, into their theory of matter. The strongest developers and defenders of this theory were the [Nyaya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyaya "Nyaya")-[Vaisheshika](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaisheshika "Vaisheshika") school, with the ideas of the Indian philosopher [Kanada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanada_(philosopher) "Kanada (philosopher)") being the most followed.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-Pullman2001p77-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-Fowler2002-7) Buddhist philosophers also developed these ideas in late 1st-millennium CE, ideas that were similar to the Vaisheshika school, but ones that did not include any soul or conscience.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-Pullman2001p77-6) Jain philosophers included the [soul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiva "Jiva") (_jiva_), adding qualities such as taste, smell, touch, and color to each atom.[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-71) They extended the ideas found in early literature of the Hindus and Buddhists by adding that atoms are either humid or dry, and this quality cements matter. They also proposed the possibility that atoms combine because of the attraction of opposites, and the soul attaches to these atoms, transforms with _[karma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma "Karma")_ residue, and [transmigrates with each rebirth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reincarnation "Reincarnation").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-Pullman2001p77-6)

In [ancient Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece "Ancient Greece"), [pre-Socratic philosophers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-Socratic_philosophy "Pre-Socratic philosophy") speculated the underlying nature of the visible world. [Thales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thales "Thales") (c. 624 BCE–c. 546 BCE) regarded water as the fundamental material of the world. [Anaximander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaximander "Anaximander") (c. 610 BCE–c. 546 BCE) posited that the basic material was wholly characterless or limitless: the Infinite (_[apeiron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apeiron\_(cosmology) "Apeiron (cosmology)")_). [Anaximenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaximenes_of_Miletus "Anaximenes of Miletus") (flourished 585 BCE, d. 528 BCE) posited that the basic stuff was _pneuma_ or air. [Heraclitus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraclitus "Heraclitus") (c. 535 BCE–c. 475 BCE) seems to say the basic element is fire, though perhaps he means that all is change. [Empedocles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empedocles "Empedocles") (c. 490–430 BCE) spoke of four [elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_element "Classical element") of which everything was made: earth, water, air, and fire.[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-72) Meanwhile, [Parmenides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parmenides "Parmenides") argued that change does not exist, and [Democritus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democritus "Democritus") argued that everything is composed of minuscule, inert bodies of all shapes called atoms, a philosophy called [atomism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomism "Atomism"). All of these notions had deep philosophical problems.[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-73)

[Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle "Aristotle") (384 BCE–322 BCE) was the first to put the conception on a sound philosophical basis, which he did in his natural philosophy, especially in [_Physics_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics_(Aristotle) "Physics (Aristotle)") book I.[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-74) He adopted as reasonable suppositions the four [Empedoclean elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_element "Classical element"), but added a fifth, [aether](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aether_(classical_element) "Aether (classical element)"). Nevertheless, these elements are not basic in Aristotle's mind. Rather they, like everything else in the visible world, are composed of the basic _principles_ matter and form.

> For my definition of matter is just this—the primary substratum of each thing, from which it comes to be without qualification, and which persists in the result.

— Aristotle, Physics I:9:192a32

The word Aristotle uses for matter, [ὕλη (_hyle_ or _hule_)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyle "Hyle"), can be literally translated as wood or timber, that is, "raw material" for building.[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-75) Indeed, Aristotle's conception of matter is intrinsically linked to something being made or composed. In other words, in contrast to the early modern conception of matter as simply occupying space, matter for Aristotle is definitionally linked to process or change: matter is what underlies a change of substance. For example, a horse eats grass: the horse changes the grass into itself; the grass as such does not persist in the horse, but some aspect of it—its matter—does. The matter is not specifically described (e.g., as [atoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom "Atom")), but consists of whatever persists in the change of substance from grass to horse. Matter in this understanding does not exist independently (i.e., as a [substance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_theory "Substance theory")), but exists interdependently (i.e., as a "principle") with form and only insofar as it underlies change. It can be helpful to conceive of the relationship of matter and form as very similar to that between parts and whole. For Aristotle, matter as such can only _receive_ actuality from form; it has no activity or actuality in itself, similar to the way that parts as such only have their existence _in_ a whole (otherwise they would be independent wholes).

### Age of Enlightenment

French philosopher [René Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes "René Descartes") (1596–1650) originated the modern conception of matter. He was primarily a geometer. Unlike Aristotle, who deduced the existence of matter from the physical reality of change, Descartes arbitrarily postulated matter to be an abstract, mathematical substance that occupies space:

> So, extension in length, breadth, and depth, constitutes the nature of bodily substance; and thought constitutes the nature of thinking substance. And everything else attributable to body presupposes extension, and is only a mode of an extended thing.

— René Descartes, Principles of Philosophy[[76]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-76)

For Descartes, matter has only the property of extension, so its only activity aside from locomotion is to exclude other bodies:[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-77) this is the [mechanical philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(philosophy) "Mechanism (philosophy)"). Descartes makes an absolute distinction between mind, which he defines as unextended, thinking substance, and matter, which he defines as unthinking, extended substance.[[78]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-78) They are independent things. In contrast, Aristotle defines matter and the formal/forming principle as complementary _principles_ that together compose one independent thing ([substance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_theory "Substance theory")). In short, Aristotle defines matter (roughly speaking) as what things are actually made of (with a _potential_ independent existence), but Descartes elevates matter to an actual independent thing in itself.

The continuity and difference between Descartes's and Aristotle's conceptions is noteworthy. In both conceptions, matter is passive or inert. In the respective conceptions matter has different relationships to intelligence. For Aristotle, matter and intelligence (form) exist together in an interdependent relationship, whereas for Descartes, matter and intelligence (mind) are definitionally opposed, independent [substances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_theory "Substance theory").[[79]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-79)

Descartes's justification for restricting the inherent qualities of matter to extension is its permanence, but his real criterion is not permanence (which equally applied to color and resistance), but his desire to use geometry to explain all material properties.[[80]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-80) Like Descartes, Hobbes, Boyle, and Locke argued that the inherent properties of bodies were limited to extension, and that so-called secondary qualities, like color, were only products of human perception.[[81]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-81)

English philosopher [Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton") (1643–1727) inherited Descartes's mechanical conception of matter. In the third of his "Rules of Reasoning in Philosophy", Newton lists the universal qualities of matter as "extension, hardness, impenetrability, mobility, and inertia".[[82]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-82) Similarly in _Optics_ he conjectures that God created matter as "solid, massy, hard, impenetrable, movable particles", which were "...even so very hard as never to wear or break in pieces".[[83]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-83) The "primary" properties of matter were amenable to mathematical description, unlike "secondary" qualities such as color or taste. Like Descartes, Newton rejected the essential nature of secondary qualities.[[84]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-84)

Newton developed Descartes's notion of matter by restoring to matter intrinsic properties in addition to extension (at least on a limited basis), such as mass. Newton's use of gravitational force, which worked "at a distance", effectively repudiated Descartes's mechanics, in which interactions happened exclusively by contact.[[85]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-Chomsky-85)

Though Newton's gravity would seem to be a _power_ of bodies, Newton himself did not admit it to be an _essential_ property of matter. Carrying the logic forward more consistently, [Joseph Priestley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Priestley "Joseph Priestley") (1733–1804) argued that corporeal properties transcend contact mechanics: chemical properties require the _capacity_ for attraction.[[85]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-Chomsky-85) He argued matter has other inherent powers besides the so-called primary qualities of Descartes, et al.[[86]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-86)

### 19th and 20th centuries

Since Priestley's time, there has been a massive expansion in knowledge of the constituents of the material world (viz., molecules, atoms, subatomic particles). In the 19th century, following the development of the [periodic table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_table "Periodic table"), and of [atomic theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_theory "Atomic theory"), [atoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom "Atom") were seen as being the fundamental constituents of matter; atoms formed [molecules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecules "Molecules") and [compounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_(chemistry) "Compound (chemistry)").[[87]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-Wenham-87)

The common definition in terms of occupying space and having mass is in contrast with most physical and chemical definitions of matter, which rely instead upon its structure and upon attributes not necessarily related to volume and mass. At the turn of the nineteenth century, the knowledge of matter began a rapid evolution.

Aspects of the Newtonian view still held sway. [James Clerk Maxwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell "James Clerk Maxwell") discussed matter in his work _Matter and Motion_.[[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-Maxwell-88) He carefully separates "matter" from space and time, and defines it in terms of the object referred to in [Newton's first law of motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_first_law_of_motion "Newton's first law of motion").

However, the Newtonian picture was not the whole story. In the 19th century, the term "matter" was actively discussed by a host of scientists and philosophers, and a brief outline can be found in Levere.[[89]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-Levere-89)[_[further explanation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please\_clarify "Wikipedia:Please clarify")_] One [textbook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textbook "Textbook") discussion from 1870 suggests that matter is what is made up of atoms:[[90]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-Barker-90)

> Three divisions of matter are recognized in science: masses, molecules and atoms.
> 
> A Mass of matter is any portion of matter appreciable by the senses.
> 
> A Molecule is the smallest particle of matter into which a body can be divided without losing its identity.
> 
> An Atom is a still smaller particle produced by division of a molecule.

Rather than simply having the attributes of mass and occupying space, matter was held to have chemical and electrical properties. In 1909 the famous physicist [J. J. Thomson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._J._Thomson "J. J. Thomson") (1856–1940) wrote about the "constitution of matter" and was concerned with the possible connection between matter and electrical charge.[[91]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-Thomson-91)

In the late 19th century with the [discovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomson_experiment "Thomson experiment") of the [electron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron "Electron"), and in the early 20th century, with the [Geiger–Marsden experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geiger%E2%80%93Marsden_experiment "Geiger–Marsden experiment") discovery of the [atomic nucleus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_nucleus "Atomic nucleus"), and the birth of [particle physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics "Particle physics"), matter was seen as made up of electrons, [protons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton "Proton") and [neutrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron "Neutron") interacting to form atoms. There then developed an entire literature concerning the "structure of matter", ranging from the "electrical structure" in the early 20th century,[[92]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-Richardson-92) to the more recent "quark structure of matter", introduced as early as 1992 by Jacob with the remark: "Understanding the quark structure of matter has been one of the most important advances in contemporary physics."[[93]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-Jacob-93)[_[further explanation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please\_clarify "Wikipedia:Please clarify")_] In this connection, physicists speak of _matter fields_, and speak of particles as "quantum excitations of a mode of the matter field".[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-Davies-9)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-Weinberg-10) And here is a quote from de Sabbata and Gasperini: "With the word 'matter' we denote, in this context, the sources of the interactions, that is [spinor fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor_field "Spinor field") (like [quarks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark "Quark") and [leptons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lepton "Lepton")), which are believed to be the fundamental components of matter, or [scalar fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosonic_field "Bosonic field"), like the [Higgs particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_particle "Higgs particle"), which are used to introduced mass in a [gauge theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_theory "Gauge theory") (and that, however, could be composed of more fundamental [fermion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermion "Fermion")[fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermionic_field "Fermionic field"))."[[94]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-Sabbata-94)[_[further explanation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please\_clarify "Wikipedia:Please clarify")_]

Protons and neutrons however are not indivisible: they can be divided into [quarks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark "Quark"). And electrons are part of a particle family called [leptons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lepton "Lepton"). Both [quarks and leptons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#Quarks_and_leptons_definition) are [elementary particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_particle "Elementary particle"), and were in 2004 seen by authors of an undergraduate text as being the fundamental constituents of matter.[[95]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-Povh1-95)

These quarks and leptons interact through four [fundamental forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_forces "Fundamental forces"): [gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity "Gravity"), [electromagnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetism "Electromagnetism"), [weak interactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_interaction "Weak interaction"), and [strong interactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_interaction "Strong interaction"). The [Standard Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model "Standard Model") of particle physics is currently the best explanation for all of physics, but despite decades of efforts, gravity cannot yet be accounted for at the quantum level; it is only described by [classical physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_physics "Classical physics") (see _[Quantum gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum\_gravity "Quantum gravity")_ and _[Graviton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graviton "Graviton")_)[[96]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-Allday2-96) to the frustration of theoreticians like [Stephen Hawking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hawking "Stephen Hawking"). Interactions between quarks and leptons are the result of an exchange of [force-carrying particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_carriers "Force carriers") such as [photons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon "Photon") between quarks and leptons.[[97]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-97) The force-carrying particles are not themselves building blocks. As one consequence, mass and energy (which to our present knowledge cannot be created or destroyed) cannot always be related to matter (which can be created out of non-matter particles such as photons, or even out of pure energy, such as kinetic energy).[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] Force mediators are usually not considered matter: the mediators of the electric force (photons) possess energy (see _[Planck relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck\_relation "Planck relation")_) and the mediators of the weak force ([W and Z bosons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W_and_Z_bosons "W and Z bosons")) have mass, but neither are considered matter either.[[98]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-PhotonsMatter-98) However, while these quanta are not considered matter, they do contribute to the total mass of atoms, [subatomic particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subatomic_particle "Subatomic particle"), and all systems that contain them.[[99]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-Tipler0-99)[[100]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#cite_note-Spitzer-100)

Matter particles and antimatter particles belong to two distinct classes of particles. Matter-neutral particles are particles characterized by both zero baryon number and zero lepton number. This third class of particles includes mesons formed by a quark and an antiquark pair (a pair of matter particle and antimatter particle) and bosons which are messengers of known interactions (photons for electromagnetism, W and Z bosons for the weak interaction, gluons for the strong interaction). The antiparticle of a matter particle belongs to the class of antimatter particles, the antiparticle of an antimatter particle belongs to the class of matter particles.

One may use a definition that matter is atoms, or that matter is [hadrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadron "Hadron"), or that matter is leptons and quarks depending upon the scale at which one wishes to define matter.
