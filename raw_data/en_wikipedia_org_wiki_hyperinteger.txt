A hyperinteger may be either finite or infinite.  A finite hyperinteger is an ordinary integer .  An example of an infinite hyperinteger is given by the class of the sequence (1, 2, 3, ...) in the ultrapower construction of the hyperreals.

Discussion [ edit ] The standard integer part function : ⌊ ⌊ x ⌋ ⌋ {\displaystyle \lfloor x\rfloor } is defined for all real x and equals the greatest integer not exceeding x .  By the transfer principle of nonstandard analysis, there exists a natural extension: ∗ ∗ ⌊ ⌊ ⋅ ⋅ ⌋ ⌋ {\displaystyle {}^{*}\!\lfloor \,\cdot \,\rfloor } defined for all hyperreal x , and we say that x is a hyperinteger if x = ∗ ∗ ⌊ ⌊ x ⌋ ⌋ .

{\displaystyle x={}^{*}\!\lfloor x\rfloor .} Thus, the hyperintegers are the image of the integer part function on the hyperreals.

Internal sets [ edit ] The set ∗ ∗ Z {\displaystyle ^{*}\mathbb {Z} } of all hyperintegers is an internal subset of the hyperreal line ∗ ∗ R {\displaystyle ^{*}\mathbb {R} } .  The set of all finite hyperintegers (i.e.

Z {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} } itself) is not an internal subset.  Elements of the complement ∗ ∗ Z ∖ ∖ Z {\displaystyle ^{*}\mathbb {Z} \setminus \mathbb {Z} } are called, depending on the author, nonstandard , unlimited , or infinite hyperintegers. The reciprocal of an infinite hyperinteger is always an infinitesimal .

Nonnegative hyperintegers are sometimes called hypernatural numbers.  Similar remarks apply to the sets N {\displaystyle \mathbb {N} } and ∗ ∗ N {\displaystyle ^{*}\mathbb {N} } .  Note that the latter gives a non-standard model of arithmetic in the sense of Skolem .
