Peter Hall (later Sir Peter), the noted urban geographer, was one of his contemporaries.

He held numerous teaching posts and visiting professorships at institutions around the world, but is most particularly associated with the University of Bristol where he was a lecturer and professor of geography from 1966. Among the many awards and distinguished recognitions conferred, Haggett was awarded the French Lauréat Prix International de Géographie Vautrin Lud in 1991, and made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1993 Birthday Honours , for "services to urban and regional geography".
