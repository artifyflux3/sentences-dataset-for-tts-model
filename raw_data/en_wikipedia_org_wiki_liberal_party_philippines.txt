[ 10 ] Founded on January 19, 1946 by Manuel Roxas , Elpidio Quirino , and José Avelino from the breakaway liberal wing of the old Nacionalista , the Liberal remains the second-oldest active political party in the Philippines after the Nacionalista, and the oldest continually active party. The Liberals served as the governing party of four Philippine presidents: Manuel Roxas , Elpidio Quirino , Diosdado Macapagal , and Benigno Aquino III .

As a vocal opposition party to the dictatorship of their former member Ferdinand Marcos , it reemerged as a major political party after the People Power Revolution and the establishment of the Fifth Republic . It subsequently served as a senior member of President Corazon Aquino 's UNIDO coalition. Upon Corazon Aquino's death in 2009, the party regained popularity, winning the 2010 Philippine presidential election under Benigno Aquino III and returning it to government to serve from 2010 to 2016. This was the only instance the party had won the presidency since the end of the Marcos dictatorship, however, as it lost control of the office to Rodrigo Duterte of PDP–Laban in the 2016 presidential election and became the leading opposition party once again. Its vice presidential candidate Leni Robredo won in the same election, narrowly beating Marcos' son by a small margin.

[ 11 ] The Liberal Party was the political party of the immediate past Vice President of the Philippines . In the 2019 midterm elections , the party remained the primary opposition party of the Philippines, holding three seats in the Senate . The Liberals was the largest party outside of Rodrigo Duterte's supermajority , holding 18 seats in the House of Representatives after 2019. In local government, the party held two provincial governorships and five vice governorships. The general election of 2022, however, was a setback for the party, which lost both the Presidency and Vice-Presidency, as well as all of its seats in the Senate, and saw its representation in the House of Representatives reduced.

The Liberals remains an influential organization in contemporary Philippine politics . With moderately progressive positions on social issues and centrist positions on economic issues, it is commonly associated with the post-revolution, liberal-democratic status quo of the Philippines in contrast to authoritarianism , conservatism , and socialism . Aside from presidents, the party has been led by liberal thinkers and politicians including Benigno Aquino Jr.

, Jovito Salonga , Raul Daza , Florencio Abad , Franklin Drilon , and Mar Roxas . Two of its members, Corazon Aquino and Leila de Lima , have received the prestigious Prize For Freedom , one of the highest international awards for liberal and democratic politicians since 1985 given by Liberal International. The Liberals is a member of the Council of Asian Liberals and Democrats and Liberal International .

Quirino waving to the crowd Riding on the crest of the growing wave of resentment against Liberal, a move was next hatched to indict President Quirino himself.

[ 16 ] A committee of seven members of the House of Representatives, led by Congressman Agripino Escareal, drafted a five-count complaint that ranged from exorbitant spending to nepotism . A seven-member committee led by Representative Lorenzo Sumulong was created by Speaker Eugenio Pérez to investigate the charges before they were submitted to the Senate, serving as an impeachment body. Felix Angelo Bautista, the Solicitor General , arrived as the top executive's defense attorney.

[ 16 ] Following several hearings, on April 19, 1949, after a rather turbulent session that lasted all night, the congressional committee reached a verdict completely exonerating the President.

Quirino officially selected by the party, with José Yulo as his running-mate, because Lopez will join Romulo and his supporter's walk-out march out of the party. Magsaysay jumped to Nacionalista and got the party's nomination over one of its stalwarts Senate President Camilo Osías (who also jumped to Liberal with Jose Zulueta ), in April 12, 1953.

[ 21 ] Romulo and Lopez founded the Democratic Party [ 22 ] in May 29, 1953, [ 23 ] with the two founders selected as their presidential and vice presidential nominee.

[ 24 ] But later, the two cancelled their candidacy and supported Magsaysay's candidacy.

[ 25 ] [ 26 ] Quirino's campaign was bombarded by controversies and issues, like with one of party's member named Negros Occidental Governor Rafael Lacson, a corrupt politician who killed Moises Padilla, his challenger in 1951 elections, and friend of Magsaysay which popularized by a photograph taken with Magsaysay carrying Padilla's dead body, and also being used by the latter in his campaign.

Later, In January 1961, Marcos and Macapagal agreed that the latter will be the presidential nominee, while Marcos will be the new party president replacing Macapagal.

[ 32 ] Macapagal promised that he will only run for one term, and Marcos will be the nominee in after his term.

[ 33 ] Macapagal will challenge Garcia, choosing young Senator Emmanuel Pelaez . The two managed to defeat the administration ticket of Garcia and Senator Gil Puyat .

[ 34 ] Stonehill Scandal [ edit ] Main article: Stonehill scandal In 1962, a bribery scandal shocked the whole country which involves some of Liberal politicians, including President Macapagal, [ 35 ] and then-Senate President Marcos.

[ 36 ] [ 37 ] Those bribed money are from a businessman named Harry Stonehill, [ 38 ] a former military officer of the United States who settled in the Philippines to make business.

Led by Ninoy Aquino , Gerry Roxas and Jovito Salonga , Liberal would hound President Marcos on issues like human rights and the curtailment of freedoms . Even after Marcos' declaration of martial law silenced the Liberal, the party continued to oppose the regime, and many of its leaders and members would be prosecuted and even killed during this time.

[ 3 ] [ 47 ] 1978 elections [ edit ] For the incoming 1978 parliamentary elections , some Liberal members joined the Kilusang Bagong Lipunan , a regime-controlled coalition, while others joined Ninoy Aquino's Lakas ng Bayan (LABAN). With many preferring not to be involved, the Liberal went to hibernation, but the party became more liberal during this era.

[ 48 ] 1981 boycott [ edit ] After Marcos lifted Martial Law with Proclamation 2045 , on January 17, 1981, [ 49 ] Liberal joined United Nationalist Democratic Organization (UNIDO), the main coalition of the opposition. But UNIDO and LABAN declared a boycott due to   Marcos did not accept the demand of UNIDO like to clean the voters' list, revamping of the Commission on Elections (COMELEC), and accreditation of UNIDO as the minority.

Drilon-Roxas wing vs Atienza wing [ edit ] Some Liberal members installed Manila Mayor Lito Atienza as the party president wayback March 2, 1998, even though that time former Congressman and then-Senate candidate Raul Daza is officially serving as the party president. What pro-Atienza wing did triggered leadership struggle and party schism lasted after Daza's leadership.

Liberal met on November 27, 2007, to decide who would succeed Franklin Drilon as the party president and to hold an election for his replacement. Both Noynoy Aquino and his Senate colleague Mar Roxas received nominations, but Aquino emerged victorious as the party's president, while Roxas is set to be the presidential nominee.

[ 67 ] The former chairman and head of the "Atienza faction" or "Pro-Arroyo faction," DENR secretary Lito Atienza, congratulated him, but he later condemned the election and referred to Drilon and his supporters as a "merry cabal of destabilizers". He added that the other group had disregarded the Supreme Court's injunction to maintain the status quo.

[ 67 ] Later, Supreme Court recognized the Drilon Wing as the sole legitimate wing of the Liberal.

[ 68 ] Even though the party had earlier nominated Mar Roxas to be its presidential candidate for the 2010 Philippine general election , Roxas gave way to Aquino and instead ran for vice president. The party was able to field new members breaking away from the then-ruling party Lakas–Kampi–CMD , becoming the largest minority party in Congress.

[ 3 ] [ 47 ] [ 69 ] Aquino would later win by plurality, and Liberal would become the majority party in Congress.

[ 70 ] But, some incidents like the appointment of party president Jun Abaya and mismanagement of the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) cost the party's next presidential elections.

[ 71 ] 'Twerk na daan' controversy [ edit ] On October 1, 2015, during an oath-taking event and birthday celebration of Liberal Congressman Benjamin Agarao of Laguna's 4th district , MMDA Chairman Francis Tolentino hired all-girl dance group Playgirls to perform at the said event.

[ 72 ] [ 73 ] Liberal leader Mar Roxas, who is absent at the said event, started an investigation about the incident, while labor groups and some women's rights advocates filed charges against Tolentino.

[ 74 ] The said controversy was coined by columnist and critics as ' Twerk na Daan ' (which was combination of the word "twerk" and "Tuwid na daan" campaign of Aquino).

Roxas defeated by former member Rodrigo Duterte of PDP–Laban, but Robredo managed to win. Most of the party's members either switched allegiance to PDP–Laban , [ 76 ] [ 77 ] [ 78 ] joined a supermajority alliance but retained their Liberal membership (with some defecting later), joined the "recognized minority", or created an opposition bloc called "Magnificent 7".

Liberal being purged under Duterte's presidency: 2016–2022 [ edit ] Post-2016 elections [ edit ] After its loss in the 2016 elections, as early as February 2017, the leaders of the Liberal chose to focus on rebuilding the party by inviting sectoral representation of non-politicians in its membership numbers.

[ 79 ] Since then the party had been inducting new members who were non-politicians, some of whom applied online through the party's website.

[ 80 ] [ 81 ] [ 82 ] Also, Senator Leila de Lima , who was pushing probe into alleged extrajudicial deaths in the early months of Duterte's war on drugs , was arrested in 2017 based on charges linked to the drug trafficking scandal in New Bilibid Prison , which the party claimed as only a product of harassment and trumped-up charges against opposing the president.

[ 83 ] Also, it prompted them to review its party rules and principles.

[ 84 ] [ 83 ] [ 85 ] [ 86 ] [ 87 ] 2019 elections: Otso Diretso [ edit ] Before the scheduled 2019 general elections , the Liberal formed Otso Diretso , an electoral coalition of eight candidates for the senate race; led by the party, the coalition field also comprised members of the Magdalo, Akbayan, and Aksyon .

[ 88 ] [ 89 ] [ 90 ] None of the eight senatorial candidates under Otso Diretso won a seat, however; it was the first time in the history of the current bicameral composition of the Philippine Congress under the 1987 Constitution that the opposition failed to win a seat in one of the chambers, and the second time that a Liberal-led coalition suffered a great loss since 1955 .

Second Marcos presidency: 2022–present [ edit ] 2022: Leni Robredo's presidential campaign [ edit ] For the 2022 Philippine presidential election , the Liberal nominated Leni Robredo and Francis Pangilinan for the presidential and vice presidential posts, respectively.

[ 91 ] [ 92 ] The party led the Team Robredo–Pangilinan (TRoPa) alliance, which included incumbent senator De Lima, other members of the Liberal, and several guest candidates from other parties such as Akbayan, as well as independents. Robredo ran as an independent candidate whilst remaining affiliated with Liberal. Both candidates lost the election to Bongbong Marcos and Sara Duterte , respectively, finishing second. While some candidates from the Liberal-led alliance were elected, no candidate from the party won a seat in the senatorial elections, for the first time since the 1995 elections.

2025: KiBam and Mamamayang Liberal [ edit ] In May 2024, Bam Aquino left Liberal to pursue the Senate race as an independent candidate, but later joined the Katipunan ng Nagkakaisang Pilipino (KNP) and became its party chair.

[ 93 ] Also of the same year, several Liberals led by De Lima formed a sectoral wing called Mamamayang Liberal (ML) for the 2025 House of Representatives elections for party-list seats. De Lima, who was released from detainment in November 2023, was selected as ML's first nominee.

[ 94 ] Former senator and vice presidential candidate Kiko Pangilinan was the Liberal's sole candidate for the senatorial elections. Pangilinan and the Liberals formed a coalition with KNP to form a coalition duo with Bam Aquino for the 2025 senate election .

The duo won the senate race and entered in the magic 12 as Aquino ranked 2nd and Pangilinan ranked 5th, resulting that they will returning in the upper house. Also the Mamamayang Liberal won the party-list race garnering with 500,000+ votes thus guaranteeing one seat in the House of Representatives. Even though de Lima joined minority in the House, Aquino and Pangilinan joined majority in the Senate.

[ 95 ] Ideology [ edit ] While the Liberal Party defines its ideology as social liberalism , [ 96 ] the party has often been described as a " centrist " or " liberal " party. Historically, the Liberal Party has been evaluated as a " conservative " party, [ 97 ] [ 98 ] with an ideology similar to or indistinguishable from the Nacionalista Party 's ideology, [ 99 ] [ 100 ] until it became the opposition party under the Marcos dictatorship , wherein it became more liberal.

[ 101 ] Being a founding member of the Council of Asian Liberals and Democrats and a full member of Liberal International , the Liberal Party advocates the values of " freedom , justice and solidarity ( bayanihan )," as described in the party's values charter.

[ 102 ] [ 103 ] Although this may be deemed theoretically true since the party's founding in 1946, it became more tangible through the party's position of continuing dissent during the Marcos dictatorship.

Since 2017, the party has opened party membership to the general public and to key sectors of society , aiming to harness a large volunteering base. According to the party, this aims to ostensibly build on "the promise of becoming a true people's party".

Symbols [ edit ] Logo from 1953 to 1965 Logo from 1965 to 2010 and from 2016 to 2021 Logo from 2010 to 2016 The Liberal Party is associated with the color yellow , a political color commonly associated with liberalism . During the People Power Revolution , opposition parties against the Marcos dictatorship, including the Liberal, used yellow ribbons as a symbol of resistance and support for Ninoy Aquino , one of the leading politicians against the regime. The color would later be co-opted by his son, Benigno Aquino III , as well as the Liberal, for his presidential campaign in 2010, which he later won.

After his presidency, yellow continued to be associated with the party, which became the leading opposition party against the presidency of their former member Rodrigo Duterte. The pejorative term dilawan ( transl.

yellowed ones ), associated with the liberal elite, has been used against the party and other critics of the Duterte administration.

[ 104 ] In an effort to distance herself from the negative connotations of the color and unite various opposition groups, then party chair Leni Robredo adopted the color pink for her presidential campaign .

[ 105 ] Both pink and yellow are currently used by the party.

[ 106 ] [ 107 ] Current political positions [ edit ] The party has declared policies geared toward inclusiveness and people empowerment .

[ 108 ] [ 10 ] It also advocates and supports secure jobs , food , shelter , universal health care , public education access , and other social services , and is against extrajudicial killings , any challenge to the rule of law , and curtailments of human rights strictures.

Legal issues [ edit ] Senator Leila de Lima , who led an investigation into alleged extrajudicial deaths in the early months of Duterte's war on drugs , was issued an arrest warrant in 2017 based on charges linked to the New Bilibid Prison drug trafficking scandal , which the party claimed was based on trumped-up charges, labelling the arrest "patently illegal".

[ 83 ] While on the whole, de Lima's investigation was seen by some pundits as an adversarial investigation that was a strategic mistake, others in the party simply saw it as a call to a review of the party's principles and how members have adhered to them.

[ 84 ] [ 83 ] [ 85 ] [ 86 ] [ 87 ] Senator De Lima has been fully acquitted of all criminal charges on June 24, 2024, [ 133 ] marking the end of her legal battle and detention that lasted over six years. De Lima, a prominent critic of former President Rodrigo Duterte, described the charges as politically motivated to silence her investigations into Duterte's controversial drug war and alleged human rights abuses.

[ 134 ] In 2019, the party, along with other groups, was accused of planning a coup against the Duterte government. The party denounced the allegation and called it a state-sponsored threat of legal abuse , demanding the government provide evidence to back the claims.

[ 135 ] Liberal presidents [ edit ] See also: List of presidents of the Philippines As of 2024, there have been a total of 4 Liberal presidents. Those who won presidency under other parties are not included.
