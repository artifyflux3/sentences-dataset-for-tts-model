A **trajectory** or **flight path** is the path that an [object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_body "Physical body") with [mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass "Mass") in [motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics) "Motion (physics)") follows through [space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space "Space") as a function of time. In [classical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics "Classical mechanics"), a trajectory is defined by [Hamiltonian mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_mechanics "Hamiltonian mechanics") via [canonical coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_coordinates "Canonical coordinates"); hence, a complete trajectory is defined by position and [momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum "Momentum"), simultaneously.

The mass might be a [projectile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projectile "Projectile") or a [satellite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite "Satellite").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajectory#cite_note-1) For example, it can be an [orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit "Orbit") — the path of a [planet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet "Planet"), [asteroid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid "Asteroid"), or [comet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet "Comet") as it travels around a [central mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_(astronomy) "Primary (astronomy)").

In [control theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory "Control theory"), a trajectory is a time-ordered set of [states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(controls) "State (controls)") of a [dynamical system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system "Dynamical system") (see e.g. [Poincaré map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_map "Poincaré map")). In [discrete mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_mathematics "Discrete mathematics"), a trajectory is a sequence ![Image 2: {\displaystyle (f^{k}(x))_{k\in \mathbb {N} }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/73d2c9caf41f19d3acad170d9b8c3029aae29067) of values calculated by the iterated application of a mapping ![Image 3: {\displaystyle f}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/132e57acb643253e7810ee9702d9581f159a1c61) to an element ![Image 4: {\displaystyle x}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/87f9e315fd7e2ba406057a97300593c4802b53e4) of its source.

Physics of trajectories
-----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Trajectory&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Physics of trajectories")]

A familiar example of a trajectory is the path of a projectile, such as a thrown ball or rock. In a significantly simplified model, the object moves only under the influence of a uniform gravitational [force field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_field_(physics) "Force field (physics)"). This can be a good approximation for a rock that is thrown for short distances, for example at the surface of the [Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon "Moon"). In this simple approximation, the trajectory takes the shape of a [parabola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabola "Parabola"). Generally when determining trajectories, it may be necessary to account for nonuniform gravitational forces and air resistance ([drag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_(physics) "Drag (physics)") and [aerodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerodynamics "Aerodynamics")). This is the focus of the discipline of [ballistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistics "Ballistics").

One of the remarkable achievements of [Newtonian mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newtonian_mechanics "Newtonian mechanics") was the derivation of [Kepler's laws of planetary motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_laws_of_planetary_motion "Kepler's laws of planetary motion"). In the gravitational field of a point mass or a spherically-symmetrical extended mass (such as the [Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun "Sun")), the trajectory of a moving object is a [conic section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conic_section "Conic section"), usually an [ellipse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipse "Ellipse") or a [hyperbola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbola "Hyperbola").[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajectory#cite_note-2) This agrees with the observed orbits of [planets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planets "Planets"), [comets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comets "Comets"), and artificial spacecraft to a reasonably good approximation, although if a comet passes close to the Sun, then it is also influenced by other [forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force "Force") such as the [solar wind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_wind "Solar wind") and [radiation pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_pressure "Radiation pressure"), which modify the orbit and cause the comet to eject material into space.

Newton's theory later developed into the branch of [theoretical physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_physics "Theoretical physics") known as [classical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics "Classical mechanics"). It employs the mathematics of [differential calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_calculus "Differential calculus") (which was also initiated by Newton in his youth). Over the centuries, countless scientists have contributed to the development of these two disciplines. Classical mechanics became a most prominent demonstration of the power of rational thought, i.e. [reason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason "Reason"), in science as well as technology. It helps to understand and predict an enormous range of [phenomena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomena "Phenomena"); trajectories are but one example.

Consider a particle of [mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass "Mass")![Image 5: {\displaystyle m}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0a07d98bb302f3856cbabc47b2b9016692e3f7bc), moving in a [potential field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_potential "Gravitational potential")![Image 6: {\displaystyle V}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/af0f6064540e84211d0ffe4dac72098adfa52845). In physical terms, mass represents [inertia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertia "Inertia"), and the field ![Image 7: {\displaystyle V}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/af0f6064540e84211d0ffe4dac72098adfa52845) represents external forces of a particular kind known as "conservative". Given ![Image 8: {\displaystyle V}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/af0f6064540e84211d0ffe4dac72098adfa52845) at every relevant position, there is a way to infer the associated force that would act at that position, say from gravity. Not all forces can be expressed in this way, however.

The motion of the particle is described by the second-order [differential equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation "Differential equation")

![Image 9: {\displaystyle m{\frac {\mathrm {d} ^{2}{\vec {x}}(t)}{\mathrm {d} t^{2}}}=-\nabla V({\vec {x}}(t)){\text{ with }}{\vec {x}}=(x,y,z).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a2a4fe0da0b1ac659547d6f087e3becc8a20f5fd)
On the right-hand side, the force is given in terms of ![Image 10: {\displaystyle \nabla V}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e1dd574e7657477e8993428d3a9238f919323f4a), the [gradient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient "Gradient") of the potential, taken at positions along the trajectory. This is the mathematical form of Newton's [second law of motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_second_law "Newton's second law"): force equals mass times acceleration, for such situations.

### Uniform gravity, neither drag nor wind

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Trajectory&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Uniform gravity, neither drag nor wind")]

[![Image 11](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/63/Inclinedthrow.gif)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Inclinedthrow.gif)

Trajectories of a mass thrown at an angle of 70°:

 without [drag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_(physics) "Drag (physics)")

 with [Stokes drag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stokes%27_law "Stokes' law")

 with [Newton drag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newtonian_fluid "Newtonian fluid")

The ideal case of motion of a projectile in a uniform gravitational field in the absence of other forces (such as air drag) was first investigated by [Galileo Galilei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei "Galileo Galilei"). To neglect the action of the atmosphere in shaping a trajectory would have been considered a futile hypothesis by practical-minded investigators all through the [Middle Ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages "Middle Ages") in [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe "Europe"). Nevertheless, by anticipating the existence of the [vacuum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum "Vacuum"), later to be demonstrated on [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth") by his collaborator [Evangelista Torricelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelista_Torricelli "Evangelista Torricelli")[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_], Galileo was able to initiate the future science of [mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics "Mechanics").[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] In a near vacuum, as it turns out for instance on the [Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon "Moon"), his simplified parabolic trajectory proves essentially correct.

In the analysis that follows, we derive the equation of motion of a projectile as measured from an [inertial frame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_frame_of_reference "Inertial frame of reference") at rest with respect to the ground. Associated with the frame is a right-hand coordinate system with its origin at the point of launch of the projectile. The ![Image 12: {\displaystyle x}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/87f9e315fd7e2ba406057a97300593c4802b53e4)-axis is tangent to the ground, and the ![Image 13: {\displaystyle y}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b8a6208ec717213d4317e666f1ae872e00620a0d)axis is perpendicular to it ( parallel to the gravitational field lines ). Let ![Image 14: {\displaystyle g}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d3556280e66fe2c0d0140df20935a6f057381d77) be the [acceleration of gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_gravity "Standard gravity"). Relative to the flat terrain, let the initial horizontal speed be ![Image 15: {\displaystyle v_{h}=v\cos(\theta )}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/05d6c8ebfaa29dfd42ee10227e15d75521802b24) and the initial vertical speed be ![Image 16: {\displaystyle v_{v}=v\sin(\theta )}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/297ef69858bf43a6caf15616e5d10abf852a45bd). It will also be shown that the [range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_of_a_projectile "Range of a projectile") is ![Image 17: {\displaystyle 2v_{h}v_{v}/g}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0ebd9a6d65d77be0003e26361dbdc6ac8c80db6c), and the maximum altitude is ![Image 18: {\displaystyle v_{v}^{2}/2g}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/39acc56dd900ca6423c89e28ce9ef7bbfdf68805). The maximum range for a given initial speed ![Image 19: {\displaystyle v}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e07b00e7fc0847fbd16391c778d65bc25c452597) is obtained when ![Image 20: {\displaystyle v_{h}=v_{v}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7ce6894197db7d0f03103bc04a705a6fbf487957), i.e. the initial angle is 45![Image 21: {\displaystyle ^{\circ }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bbace89ca5f7be7d6da90306800ac9e66c64e3d7). This range is ![Image 22: {\displaystyle v^{2}/g}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e87928a02475c66cd6fc6f514129c31cb96b511c), and the maximum altitude at the maximum range is ![Image 23: {\displaystyle v^{2}/(4g)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/604fe445ceecdac326b73c069fb61683d2b877e6).

#### Derivation of the equation of motion

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Trajectory&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Derivation of the equation of motion")]

Assume the motion of the projectile is being measured from a [free fall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_fall "Free fall") frame which happens to be at (_x_,_y_)=(0,0) at _t_=0. The equation of motion of the projectile in this frame (by the [equivalence principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_principle "Equivalence principle")) would be ![Image 24: {\displaystyle y=x\tan(\theta )}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b16c8d9fa63f1802a2c1c99c7e5575cfec17ad6d). The co-ordinates of this free-fall frame, with respect to our inertial frame would be ![Image 25: {\displaystyle y=-gt^{2}/2}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a945b85a29f8307fe912a0114de878ba7e61b308). That is, ![Image 26: {\displaystyle y=-g(x/v_{h})^{2}/2}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a3e6c73626669b450541e0280b90f0539738950a).

Now translating back to the inertial frame the co-ordinates of the projectile becomes ![Image 27: {\displaystyle y=x\tan(\theta )-g(x/v_{h})^{2}/2}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f58508b536ba3d014d2ebd16908c228654aa255d) That is:

![Image 28: {\displaystyle y=-{g\sec ^{2}\theta  \over 2v_{0}^{2}}x^{2}+x\tan \theta ,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e558807ca6f8b0412f9baf2b8990768261861cde)
(where _v_ 0 is the initial velocity, ![Image 29: {\displaystyle \theta }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6e5ab2664b422d53eb0c7df3b87e1360d75ad9af) is the angle of elevation, and _g_ is the acceleration due to gravity).

[![Image 30](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/Ideal_projectile_motion_for_different_angles.svg/500px-Ideal_projectile_motion_for_different_angles.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ideal_projectile_motion_for_different_angles.svg)

Trajectories of projectiles launched at different elevation angles but the same speed of 10 m/s in a vacuum and uniform downward gravity field of 10 m/s 2. Points are at 0.05 s intervals and length of their tails is linearly proportional to their speed. _t_ = time from launch, _T_ = time of flight, _R_ = range and _H_ = highest point of trajectory (indicated with arrows).

The **range**, _R_, is the greatest distance the object travels along the [x-axis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-axis "X-axis") in the I sector. The **initial velocity**, _v i_, is the speed at which said object is launched from the point of origin. The **initial angle**, _θ i_, is the angle at which said object is released. The _g_ is the respective gravitational pull on the object within a null-medium.

![Image 31: {\displaystyle R={v_{i}^{2}\sin 2\theta _{i} \over g}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/01bd8fd0227fd7c59f868aa82c3508c64c3da792)
The **height**, _h_, is the greatest parabolic height said object reaches within its trajectory

![Image 32: {\displaystyle h={v_{i}^{2}\sin ^{2}\theta _{i} \over 2g}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7537291bef2467e5063e672058027513c51d2287)[![Image 33](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/Selomie_Melkie_-_Forensics_Final_Project_%285%29.jpg/250px-Selomie_Melkie_-_Forensics_Final_Project_%285%29.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Selomie_Melkie_-_Forensics_Final_Project_(5).jpg)

giving the range as

![Image 37: {\displaystyle R=2v^{2}\cos(\theta )\sin(\theta )/g=v^{2}\sin(2\theta )/g\,.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6422ce3df475b4a55f8a2816b97bea659f6faec9)
This equation can be rearranged to find the angle for a required range

![Image 38: {\displaystyle \theta ={\frac {1}{2}}\sin ^{-1}\left({\frac {gR}{v^{2}}}\right)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c8d2c82cf0925c47fb1a3983c458f5596ad665f2) (Equation II: angle of projectile launch)
Note that the [sine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine "Sine") function is such that there are two solutions for ![Image 39: {\displaystyle \theta }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6e5ab2664b422d53eb0c7df3b87e1360d75ad9af) for a given range ![Image 40: {\displaystyle d_{h}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3ee1edd2deb95389b844ad43861903c1eed124ca). The angle ![Image 41: {\displaystyle \theta }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6e5ab2664b422d53eb0c7df3b87e1360d75ad9af) giving the maximum range can be found by considering the derivative or ![Image 42: {\displaystyle R}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4b0bfb3769bf24d80e15374dc37b0441e2616e33) with respect to ![Image 43: {\displaystyle \theta }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6e5ab2664b422d53eb0c7df3b87e1360d75ad9af) and setting it to zero.

![Image 44: {\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} R \over \mathrm {d} \theta }={2v^{2} \over g}\cos(2\theta )=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1e34299c9b5b5abefa2e7d27bd72e9a5245adc84)
which has a nontrivial solution at ![Image 45: {\displaystyle 2\theta =\pi /2=90^{\circ }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/630e7def0307c7c8a7a289c9ea6c6a2e54266489), or ![Image 46: {\displaystyle \theta =45^{\circ }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3019c6f437cd4a3fd82feed676cabc9a79dfb8d8). The maximum range is then ![Image 47: {\displaystyle R_{\max }=v^{2}/g\,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9432c3e8292a8102c78938b3a70c0191f98c8fd1). At this angle ![Image 48: {\displaystyle \sin(\pi /2)=1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5cc05c032047cf0df2f5893a9b9d35e1e99283ed), so the maximum height obtained is ![Image 49: {\displaystyle {v^{2} \over 4g}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d77c30f186fe1e4193f0a6d04bc9fab4d4024457).

To find the angle giving the maximum height for a given speed calculate the derivative of the maximum height ![Image 50: {\displaystyle H=v^{2}\sin ^{2}(\theta )/(2g)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d683eadef5e16fb07e20e88f26ecc3e764c7bc0c) with respect to ![Image 51: {\displaystyle \theta }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6e5ab2664b422d53eb0c7df3b87e1360d75ad9af), that is ![Image 52: {\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} H \over \mathrm {d} \theta }=v^{2}2\cos(\theta )\sin(\theta )/(2g)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4c6bbf0cd48e8c678a8d174b25826c3a57d493d3) which is zero when ![Image 53: {\displaystyle \theta =\pi /2=90^{\circ }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/090f6fd2c185351eaf7c661481fbcd5c1d5458bb). So the maximum height ![Image 54: {\displaystyle H_{\mathrm {max} }={v^{2} \over 2g}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/db0a52d89febceb1a550881644578b9135971394) is obtained when the projectile is fired straight up.

If instead of a uniform downwards gravitational force we consider two bodies [orbiting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit "Orbit") with the mutual gravitation between them, we obtain [Kepler's laws of planetary motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_laws_of_planetary_motion "Kepler's laws of planetary motion"). The derivation of these was one of the major works of [Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton") and provided much of the motivation for the development of [differential calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_calculus "Differential calculus").

If a projectile, such as a baseball or cricket ball, travels in a parabolic path, with negligible air resistance, and if a player is positioned so as to catch it as it descends, he sees its angle of elevation increasing continuously throughout its flight. The tangent of the angle of elevation is proportional to the time since the ball was sent into the air, usually by being struck with a bat. Even when the ball is really descending, near the end of its flight, its angle of elevation seen by the player continues to increase. The player therefore sees it as if it were ascending vertically at constant speed. Finding the place from which the ball appears to rise steadily helps the player to position himself correctly to make the catch. If he is too close to the batsman who has hit the ball, it will appear to rise at an accelerating rate. If he is too far from the batsman, it will appear to slow rapidly, and then to descend.
