Find sources: "Chemical composition" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( June 2025 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) A chemical composition specifies the identity, arrangement, and ratio of the chemical elements making up a compound by way of chemical and atomic bonds .

Chemical formulas can be used to describe the relative amounts of elements present in a compound. For example, the chemical formula for water is H 2 O: this means that each molecule of water is constituted by 2 atoms of hydrogen (H) and 1 atom of oxygen (O). The chemical composition of water may be interpreted as a 2:1 ratio of hydrogen atoms to oxygen atoms. Different types of chemical formulas are used to convey composition information, such as an empirical or molecular formula .

Nomenclature can be used to express not only the elements present in a compound but their arrangement within the molecules of the compound. In this way, compounds will have unique names which can describe their elemental composition.

[ 1 ] Composite mixture [ edit ] The chemical composition of a mixture can be defined as the distribution of the individual substances that constitute the mixture, called "components". In other words, it is equivalent to quantifying the concentration of each component.

[ 2 ] Because there are different ways to define the concentration of a component, there are also different ways to define the composition of a mixture. It may be expressed as molar fraction , volume fraction , mass fraction , molality , molarity or normality or mixing ratio .

Chemical composition of a mixture can be represented graphically in plots like ternary plot and quaternary plot.
