Also known as hurricanes, typhoons, or other names , tropical cyclones have caused significant destruction and loss of human life, resulting in about 2 million deaths since the 19th century. Powerful cyclones that make landfall – moving from the ocean to over land – are some of the most impactful, although that is not always the case. An average of 86 tropical cyclones of tropical storm intensity form annually worldwide, with 47 reaching hurricane/typhoon strength, and 20 becoming intense tropical cyclones, super typhoons, or major hurricanes (at least of Category 3 intensity).

In Africa , tropical cyclones can originate from tropical waves generated over the Sahara Desert , or otherwise strike the Horn of Africa and Southern Africa .

Cyclone Idai in March 2019 hit central Mozambique , becoming the deadliest tropical cyclone on record in Africa, with 1,302 fatalities, and damage estimated at US$2.2 billion.

[ nb 1 ] Réunion island, located east of Southern Africa, experiences some of the wettest tropical cyclones on record. In January 1980, Cyclone Hyacinthe produced 6,083 mm (239.5 in) of rain over 15 days, which was the largest rain total recorded from a tropical cyclone on record. In Asia , tropical cyclones from the Indian and Pacific oceans regularly affect some of the most populated countries on Earth. In 1970, a cyclone struck Bangladesh , then known as East Pakistan, producing a 6.1 m (20 ft) storm surge that killed at least 300,000 people; this made it the deadliest tropical cyclone on record. In October 2019, Typhoon Hagibis struck the Japanese island of Honshu and inflicted US$15 billion in damage, making it the costliest storm on record in Japan. The islands that comprise Oceania , from Australia to French Polynesia , are routinely affected by tropical cyclones. In Indonesia , a cyclone struck the island of Flores in April 1973, killing 1,653 people, making it the deadliest tropical cyclone recorded in the Southern Hemisphere .

Atlantic and Pacific hurricanes regularly affect North America . In the United States , hurricanes Katrina in 2005 and Harvey in 2017 are the country's costliest ever natural disasters, with monetary damage estimated at US$125 billion. Katrina struck Louisiana and destroyed much of the city of New Orleans , while Harvey caused significant flooding in southeastern Texas after it dropped 60.58 in (1,539 mm) of rainfall; this was the highest rainfall total on record in the country.

Europe is rarely affected by tropical cyclones; however, the continent regularly encounters storms after they transitioned into extratropical cyclones . Only one tropical depression – Vince in 2005 – struck Spain, and only one subtropical cyclone – Subtropical Storm Alpha in 2020 – struck Portugal. Occasionally, there are tropical-like cyclones in the Mediterranean Sea . The northern portion of South America experiences occasional tropical cyclones, with 173 fatalities from Tropical Storm Bret in August 1993. The South Atlantic Ocean is generally inhospitable to the formation of a tropical storm. However, in March 2004, Hurricane Catarina struck southeastern Brazil as the first hurricane on record in the South Atlantic Ocean.

Background [ edit ] Traditionally, tropical cyclones form in seven basins . These include the north Atlantic Ocean , the eastern and western parts of the northern Pacific Ocean , the southwestern Pacific, the southwestern and southeastern Indian Oceans , and the northern Indian Ocean ( Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal ). The western Pacific is the most active and the north Indian the least active. An average of 86 tropical cyclones of tropical storm intensity form annually worldwide, with 47 reaching hurricane/typhoon strength, and 20 becoming intense tropical cyclones, super typhoons, or major hurricanes (at least of Category 3 intensity).

[ 1 ] Scientists initially believed that there were no South Atlantic tropical cyclones , [ 2 ] an assertion proved false in 2004 when Cyclone Catarina struck southeastern Brazil .

[ 3 ] Occasionally, there are tropical-like cyclones in the Mediterranean Sea .

[ 4 ] Since the 19th century, tropical cyclones have killed about 2 million people worldwide.

[ 5 ] Effects by area [ edit ] Cyclone Gati shortly after peak intensity before making landfall on Somalia Africa [ edit ] Indian Ocean [ edit ] Horn of Africa [ edit ] Main article: List of Horn of Africa tropical cyclones The Horn of Africa is a peninsula in eastern Africa that is bordered by the Indian Ocean to the south and east, as well as the Gulf of Aden and Red Sea to its northeast. The region includes Djibouti , Eritrea , Ethiopia , and Somalia .

[ 6 ] In November 2013, a deep depression struck Somalia and killed 162 people while also causing extensive livestock damage.

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] In 2018, Cyclone Sagar traversed the Gulf of Aden and made landfall on Lughaya in northwestern Somaliland with winds of 75 km/h (47 mph).

[ 10 ] Sagar killed 53 in Somalia, 2 in Djibouti, and 23 in eastern Ethiopia.

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] In 2020, Cyclone Gati became the strongest landfalling cyclone in the Horn of Africa on record, making landfall in Somalia near Hafun with winds of 170 km/h (110 mph).

[ 16 ] Gati killed at least 9 people in Somalia.

[ 17 ] Southern Africa [ edit ] Satellite image of Cyclone Idai , one of the worst tropical cyclones on record in Africa Main article: Tropical cyclones in Southern Africa About 5% of cyclones in the south-west Indian Ocean make landfall along the east coast of Southern Africa , mostly affecting Mozambique, Tanzania, and South Africa.

[ 18 ] In April 1952, a cyclone moved ashore southeastern Tanzania near Lindi with maximum sustained winds estimated at 180 km/h (110 mph); this made the cyclone the strongest on record to strike the country.

[ 19 ] The cyclone left 34 fatalities in Tanzania.

[ 20 ] In January 1984, Tropical Storm Domoina struck southern Mozambique and later crossed into eastern South Africa. The storm killed 109 people in Mozambique, 73 people in Eswatini, and 60 people in South Africa.

[ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ] 2000 was the first year on record in which two tropical cyclones of hurricane intensity struck Mozambique. In February 2000, Cyclone Eline hit central Mozambique after weeks of flooding , and their combined effects killed around 700 people and caused an estimated $500 million (USD) in damage. Eline also killed 12 people in Zimbabwe and 21 people in South Africa. The storm was followed weeks later by Cyclone Hudah , which killed three people in Mozambique.

[ 24 ] The only other year to feature tropical cyclone landfalls in the country was 2019. In March 2019, Cyclone Idai hit central Mozambique, becoming the second-deadliest tropical cyclone in the Southern Hemisphere, and the deadliest on record in Africa. Across southern Africa, Idai killed 1,302 people – and affected more than 3 million others. Total damages from Idai across Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Madagascar, and Malawi were estimated to be at least $2.2 billion (2019 USD ).

[ 25 ] [ 26 ] About a month later, Cyclone Kenneth became the strongest tropical cyclone on record to strike Mozambique, when it moved ashore just north of Pemba . The JTWC estimated landfall winds of 220 km/h (140 mph). Kenneth killed 45 people in Mozambique, less than two months after Idai's deadly trek through the region.

[ 27 ] [ 28 ] [ 29 ] Comoros and Mayotte [ edit ] Main article: Tropical cyclones in the Comoros Islands The archipelago of the Comoros and the French overseas territory of Mayotte are located in the southern Indian Ocean in the Mozambique Channel . Due to their low latitude, the islands are rarely affected by tropical cyclones.

[ 30 ] In January 1983, Cyclone Elinah moved through the Comoros with winds of at least 136 km/h (85 mph). High waves killed 33 people and left US$23.1 million in damage.

[ 21 ] [ 30 ] In April 2019, Cyclone Kenneth produced wind gusts of around 200 km/h (120 mph), along with 10 m (33 ft) waves. Kenneth killed nine people and destroyed 4,482 homes, while damaging another 7,013.

[ 30 ] Damage was estimated at CF 81.7 billion (US$188 million), equivalent to 16% of the country's GDP.

[ 31 ] [ 32 ] In April 1984, Cyclone Kamisy passed about 50 km (31 mi) south of Mayotte, producing wind gusts of 148 km/h (92 mph). Kamisy killed one person, cut power for 48 hours, and destroyed the island's crops, with damage estimated at €25 million.

[ 33 ] In December 2024, Cyclone Chido destroyed much of Mayotte [ 34 ] [ 35 ] and caused moderate damage in Comoros .

[ 36 ] Mascarene Islands [ edit ] Cyclone Dina at peak intensity, one of the most damaging cyclones on record in the Mascarene Islands Main article: Tropical cyclones in the Mascarene Islands The Mascarene Islands consist of Mauritius , the Mauritian island of Rodrigues , and the French overseas territory of Réunion , along with other smaller islands in the region.

In April 1892, a late-season cyclone impacted Mauritius, leaving 1,200 fatalities and causing $9.75 million (1892 USD, $277 million 2020 USD) in damage; this was the deadliest cyclone to affect the region in recorded history.

[ 37 ] [ 38 ] In February 1975, Cyclone Gervaise made landfall on Mauritius, producing the highest wind gust recorded on the island of 280 km/h (170 mph) at Mon Desert.

[ 39 ] Damage was estimated at US$200 million, and 10 people died as a result of the storm.

[ 21 ] In 1994, Cyclone Hollanda passed near Mauritius, leaving US$135 million in damage.

[ 40 ] Severe Tropical Storm Monique passed just northwest of Rodrigues in 1968, producing a pressure of 933 millibars (27.55 inHg) on the island.

[ 39 ] Combined with a previous tropical cyclone that affected the island earlier that year, Cyclone Carmen , the storms caused at least US$5 million in damage.

[ 21 ] The costliest tropical cyclone on record in Réunion was Cyclone Dina , which caused $190 million (2002 USD) in damage on the island, in addition to $97 million in Mauritius.

[ 41 ] [ 42 ] Dina also produced the highest wind gust recorded on Réunion, at 277 km/h (172 mph).

[ 41 ] The storm indirectly killed 10 people; 6 in Réunion and 4 in Mauritius.

[ 43 ] [ 44 ] In January 1948, a tropical cyclone struck Réunion, causing 165 deaths; this is the deadliest tropical cyclone on record on the island.

[ 45 ] Some of the wettest tropical cyclones on record have impacted Réunion, including the wettest tropical cyclone of all time, Cyclone Hyacinthe .

[ 46 ] [ 47 ] In January 1980, Hyacinthe took an erratic track near the island, resulting in torrential rain falling across almost all of the island; nearly the entire island received over 1 m (3.3 ft) of rain.

[ 48 ] At Commerson Crater , Hyacinthe dropped 6,083 mm (239.5 in) of rain, the largest rain total recorded from a tropical cyclone on record.

[ 49 ] [ 50 ] Overall, Hyacinthe caused $167 million (1980 USD) in damage, and killed 25 people.

[ 48 ] [ 21 ] Other record-breaking rainfall events caused by tropical cyclones in Réunion include Cyclone Denise , which dropped 1,144 mm (45.0 in) of rain in 12 hours and 1,825 mm (71.9 in) in 24 hours at Foc Foc; an unnamed tropical cyclone in 1958 caused 2,467 mm (97.1 in) of rain to fall at Aurere; and Cyclone Gamede dropped 3,929 mm (154.7 in) of rain at Commerson Crater.

[ 51 ] Gamede caused an estimated $120 million (2007 USD) in damage in Réunion, and killed 4 people overall in the Mascarene Islands.

[ 52 ] [ 53 ] [ 54 ] Madagascar [ edit ] On average, 1.5 tropical cyclones strike Madagascar each year, which is the most affected area in Africa.

[ 55 ] Each year, tropical cyclones cause an average of U$87 million in damage, resulting in $20 million in emergency costs. Most of the island is susceptible to flooding from tropical cyclones, with the northern portion of the country most likely to experience a significant storm surge.

Toamasina , located in east-central Madagascar, is the most likely area to experience tropical cyclone damage.

[ 56 ] In March 1927, a tropical cyclone struck eastern Madagascar, killing at least 500 people.

[ 57 ] On March 7, 2004, Cyclone Gafilo made landfall in northeastern Madagascar just south of Antalaha as a very intense tropical cyclone, making it one of the strongest cyclones on record to hit the country. Gafilo killed 363 people in the country and left $250 million in damage (2004 USD). Nationwide, Gafilo destroyed over 20,000 homes, leaving 304,000 people homeless, more than half near Antalaha. The ferry Sansom , sailing from Comoros to Mahajanga in northwestern Madagascar, capsized amid high waves, killing 117 of the 120 people on board.

[ 58 ] [ 59 ] Seychelles [ edit ] Due to its proximity to the equator, the Seychelles is rarely affected by tropical cyclones. In December 2006, Cyclone Bondo passed through the Farquhar Group of islands, producing damaging high winds and waves.

[ 60 ] [ 61 ] Northern Africa [ edit ] On occasion, cyclones in the Mediterranean can affect northern Africa, and which also have characteristics of a tropical cyclone. In September 2023, Storm Daniel moved ashore Libya and produced heavy rainfall, producing flash flooding after two dams failed. The storm killed at least 4,333 people in the country, becoming the deadliest storm to hit Africa in recorded history.

[ 62 ] [ 63 ] In September 1969, a cyclone in the Mediterranean Sea killed nearly 600 people in Tunisia and Libya .

[ 64 ] West Africa [ edit ] Hurricane Fred over Cape Verde at hurricane strength Main article: List of West Africa hurricanes The temperature contrast between the hot Sahara Desert in northern Africa and the cooler Gulf of Guinea to the south produces the African easterly jet , which generates tropical waves , or an elongated area of low pressure . These waves are often the formation source of Atlantic and Pacific hurricanes .

[ 65 ] Occasionally, tropical cyclones develop from tropical waves near or along the coastline of western Africa. In 1973, Tropical Storm Christine developed over the country of Guinea .

[ 66 ] In August 2015, Hurricane Fred formed just off the coast of Guinea, and it soon became the easternmost hurricane in the tropical Atlantic.

Swells from the hurricane produced violent seas along the West African shoreline, destroying fishing villages and submerging swaths of residential areas in Senegal . Fred was the first hurricane to move through Cape Verde since 1892 .

[ 67 ] [ 68 ] [ 69 ] Other deadly storms in Cape Verde include Tropical Storm Beryl in 1982 which killed three people, Tropical Storm Fran in 1984, which killed at least 29 people, and Hurricane Debbie in 1961, which caused a plane crash that killed 60 people.

[ 21 ] [ 70 ] Although Western Africa is rarely affected directly by tropical cyclones, the extratropical remnants of Tropical Storm Delta in 2005 struck Morocco.

[ 71 ] Tropical cyclones in the South Atlantic Ocean are unusual; however, a possible tropical storm formed west of Angola in April 1991.

[ 72 ] [ 73 ] Asia [ edit ] Road damage in Muscat, Oman from Cyclone Gonu , the strongest recorded tropical cyclone to strike the Arabian Peninsula Indian Ocean [ edit ] Arabian Peninsula [ edit ] Main article: List of Arabian Peninsula tropical cyclones The Arabian Peninsula is a peninsula between the Red Sea , the Arabian Sea , and the Persian Gulf . Although tropical cyclones often form in the southeastern Arabian Sea, most storms tend to dissipate before reaching the Arabian Peninsula due to cooler waters or dry air from the Arabian desert.

[ 74 ] [ 75 ] [ 76 ] Despite that, there have been occasionally intense tropical cyclones to affect the peninsula.

Cyclone Gonu in June 2007 made landfall in extreme eastern Oman near Ras al Hadd with winds of 150 km/h (93 mph), [ 77 ] [ 78 ] making it the strongest tropical cyclone on record to strike the Arabian Peninsula.

[ 79 ] Gonu killed 50 people and caused US$4.2 billion in damage in Oman, making it the worst natural disaster on record in the country.

[ 80 ] In June 1977, a cyclone struck eastern Oman and killed at least 105 people; it was considered Oman's worst natural disaster of the 20th century.

[ 21 ] [ 81 ] In 1996, a tropical storm that struck Oman produced the worst flooding in record in neighboring Yemen, as well as the heaviest rainfall in 70 years. The floods killed 338 people, and damaged structures built 2,000 years by the Roman Empire .

[ 82 ] [ 83 ] [ 74 ] In November 2015, Cyclone Chapala became the first recorded storm to make landfall in Yemen as a very severe cyclonic storm – the equivalent of a hurricane – when it struck Ar Riyan with winds of 120 km/h (75 mph).

[ 84 ] [ 85 ] Just days later, Cyclone Megh followed a similar path and struck southeastern Yemen.

[ 86 ] Collectively, Megh and Chapala killed 26 people and injured 78 in Yemen.

[ 87 ] Bangladesh [ edit ] Satellite image of the 1991 Bangladesh cyclone Main article: List of Bangladesh tropical cyclones Located in the northeastern extent of the Bay of Bengal, Bangladesh is highly populated and near sea-level, which makes the country vulnerable to storm surge flooding from landfalling tropical cyclones.

[ 5 ] From 1950 to 2001, an average 1.26 tropical cyclones struck Bangladesh each year, most commonly in May and October.

[ 88 ] About once every five years, a severe tropical cyclone affected the country.

[ 89 ] Bangladesh has a history of deadly tropical cyclones. A cyclone in 1876 killed at least 100,000 people, and another cyclone in 1897 killed 175,000 people.

[ 89 ] On November 12, 1970, a cyclone struck Bangladesh, then known as East Pakistan, producing a 6.1 m (20 ft) storm surge that killed at least 300,000 people. This made it the deadliest tropical cyclone on record.

[ 90 ] The cyclone wrecked about 400,000 houses, 99,000 boats, and 3,500 schools. The local government's lack of response to the storm was a partial factor in the Bangladesh Liberation War , one of the first instances in which a natural disaster led to a civil war.

[ 91 ] After the storm, Bangladesh instituted a Cyclone Preparedness Programme to better inform residents of approaching storms, construct more shelters, and restore coastal mangrove forests to mitigate storm surge flooding.

[ 5 ] Another powerful cyclone struck the country in 1991, killing 138,000 people and displacing around 10 million people homeless, with more than 1 million homes destroyed.

[ 92 ] In 2007, a similarly strong Cyclone Sidr struck the country, killing 3,406 people. The reduced death toll, compared to the 1970 and 1991 storm, was partially due to the improved warning systems and more shelters.

[ 93 ] India [ edit ] Satellite image of the 1999 super cyclone that struck Odisha Main article: Tropical cyclones in India The India Meteorological Department issues warnings for all tropical cyclones in the northern Indian Ocean. Tropical cyclones more typically affect India from the Bay of Bengal on its east coast than the Arabian Sea on its west coast. The east Indian state of Odisha has historically been the most affected throughout the country, while the most landfalls by severe cyclonic storms occurred in Andhra Pradesh . On India's west coast, the most commonly affected state was Gujarat .

[ 94 ] From 1891 to 2000, there was an average of 3.2 tropical cyclone landfalls in the country's, most of which were on the east coast along the Bay of Bengal.

[ 95 ] The strongest cyclone on record in the Bay of Bengal was a super cyclonic storm in 1999 , which made landfall on Paradeep , Odisha, in October 1999, with winds of 260 km/h (160 mph).

[ 94 ] The cyclone killed 9,887 people across Odisha, with 1.6 million houses damaged or destroyed.

[ 96 ] Damage was estimated at US$1.5 billion.

[ 97 ] The only other super cyclonic storm in India was a landfalling storm in Andhra Pradesh in 1977 , [ 94 ] which killed at least 10,000 people and left ₹ 1.7 billion (US$196 million) in damage.

[ 98 ] [ 99 ] Other deadly Indian cyclones include cyclones in 1833 and 1864, both of which killed about 50,000 people.

[ 89 ] In May 2020, Cyclone Amphan moved ashore in West Bengal , inflicting at least 1 trillion (US$13.2 billion) in damage; this made Amphan India's costliest cyclone on record.

[ 100 ] [ 97 ] Inland countries [ edit ] Afghanistan is a mountainous country north of Pakistan.

[ 101 ] In June 2007, the remnants of Cyclone Yemyin caused damaging floods in the country that killed at least 56 people.

[ 102 ] The remnants of a cyclone hitting eastern India also produced heavy rainfall and snowfall in the mountains of Nepal, killing 63 people. The snow caught mountain trekking teams off-guard, and 24 hikers were killed by an avalanche near Gokyo , which made it Nepal's deadliest avalanche in Nepal to affect a hiking expedition.

[ 103 ] [ 104 ] [ 105 ] On October 12, 2014, Cyclone Hudhud struck southeastern India and maintained its identity as a low pressure area as it moved through the country into the Himalayas. Hudhud interacted with an approaching trough from the west. The orographic lift of the mountains led to heavy rainfall, estimated at more than 160 mm (6.3 in), while also producing blizzard conditions in some areas. Avalanches killed 43 people, including 21 trekkers climbing Mount Annapurna .

[ 106 ] [ 107 ] On May 20, 2020, Cyclone Amphan moved ashore near the border of India and Bangladesh, and continued moving northeastward while weakening.

[ 108 ] Heavy rainfall in Bhutan caused landslides, flooding, and power outages.

[ 109 ] [ 110 ] Iran [ edit ] In June 2007, Cyclone Gonu moved ashore southern Iran after affecting the Arabian Peninsula. It was the first storm to strike the country since 1898. Gonu killed 23 people and left US$216 million in damage.

[ 80 ] Maldives [ edit ] On October 31, 2012, Cyclone Nilam moved ashore southern India. Heavy rainfall extended far from the circulation, resulting in flooding in the Maldives that left US$133,090 in damage.

[ 111 ] [ 112 ] Myanmar [ edit ] Cyclone Nargis shortly before landfall in the Ayeyarwady Region of Myanmar Main article: List of tropical cyclones that affected Myanmar In May 2008, Cyclone Nargis struck the low-lying Irrawaddy Delta of Myanmar with strong winds and a 3.7 m (12 ft) storm surge, killing an estimated 140,000 people, and becoming the country's worst natural disaster on record. This made Nargis among the deadliest tropical cyclones on record. Myanmar was largely unprepared for the cyclone, lacking shelters and an early warning system. Nargis damaged or destroyed more than 700,000 homes, leaving more than 1 million people homeless. Damage was estimated at over US$10 billion. In the ten years after the cyclone, Myanmar installed radar and observation stations while improving its early warning system.

[ 5 ] [ 113 ] [ 114 ] Pakistan [ edit ] The 1999 Pakistan cyclone making landfall near Karachi in Pakistan Main article: List of tropical cyclones in Pakistan In December 1965, a cyclone hit Karachi , killing an estimated 10,000 people, making it Pakistan 's deadliest tropical cyclone since 1950. It was one of only six cyclones to strike Pakistan from 1950 to 2012.

[ 115 ] In May 1999, Pakistan's strongest landfalling cyclone hit near Karachi, killing an estimated 6,200 people; many of them were swept out to sea.

[ 116 ] More than 75,000 houses were destroyed.

[ 117 ] Sri Lanka [ edit ] Main article: List of Sri Lanka tropical cyclones Tropical cyclones occasionally affect the island nation of Sri Lanka , especially the north and eastern portions of the island. Most of the landfalling cyclones occurred in November or December, during the island's Maha season.

[ 118 ] [ 119 ] In December 1964, a cyclone produced a significant storm surge of 4.5 m (15 ft), with up to 2,000 people killed on the island.

[ 120 ] A powerful cyclone in 1978 killed more than 1,000 people in the country, with more than 250,000 houses damaged.

[ 118 ] In May 2003, a cyclonic storm stalled in the Bay of Bengal, and its plume of moisture produced the worst disaster on Sri Lanka in over 50 years. Flooding and landslides killed 260 people.

[ 119 ] West Pacific [ edit ] China [ edit ] Satellite image of Typhoon Saomai nearing the Chinese province of Zhejiang One of the oldest known typhoons to strike China was in November 975, when a typhoon struck Guangzhou .

[ 121 ] Each year on average, about ten tropical cyclones make landfall in China, and another two storms affect the coast without moving ashore. The most affected provinces are Hainan and Guangdong in southern China, along with Fujian and Zhejiang in southeastern China. Less commonly affected provinces are Jiangsu , Shanghai , and Shandong where the coastline curves to the northwest, and at which latitude most typhoons recurve to the northeast.

[ 122 ] [ 123 ] In late August 1931, a typhoon struck Shanghai following a series of storms making landfall in China. The typhoon contributed to China's worst recorded flooding , causing a break in the levee along Lake Gaoyou and the Grand Canal . The breaks flooded a 25,900 km 2 (10,000 sq mi) portion of northern Jiangsu , including 80 towns, killing 300,000 people, according to contemporaneous news reports. In the city of Gaoyou , the levee break killed 2,000 people in the middle of the night.

[ 124 ] [ 125 ] [ 126 ] [ 127 ] [ 128 ] [ 129 ] In August 1975, Typhoon Nina struck the Chinese province of Fujian and progressed into central China, dropping torrential rainfall totaling 1,605 mm (63.2 in) over three days in the province of Henan . The resulting floods caused 64 dams to fail , including the large Banqiao and Shimantan dams, which directly killed 26,000 people and indirectly killed another 100,000 people.

In October 2017, Hurricane Nate affected the country, becoming the costliest natural disaster in Costa Rican history, with damages of $562 million (2017 USD).

[ 290 ] Heavy rains occurred across the country, peaking at 487 mm (19.2 in) of rainfall in Maritima, and there were reports of over 254 mm (10.0 in) of rain in several locations.

[ 291 ] 800 people had to be rescued, 11,300 people were forced into shelters, and 14 people died as a result of Nate in Costa Rica.

[ 292 ] [ 293 ] [ 294 ] In late November 2016, Hurricane Otto passed over Costa Rica, despite making landfall just north of the border with Nicaragua.

[ 295 ] Some areas of Costa Rica received over a month's worth of rainfall from the storm.

[ 296 ] 10 people died in Costa Rica as a result of Otto's passing, and damage from the storm in the country was totaled at $192.2 million (2016 USD).

[ 295 ] [ 297 ] Hurricane Cesar brought heavy rains to the country in July 1996, causing mudslides and widespread flooding. At least 39 people died and 29 more people were labeled as missing after the storm in Costa Rica; damages were estimated at $151 million (1996 USD).

[ 298 ] Hurricane Mitch in 1998 brought heavy rain, causing flash flooding and mudslides. 4,000 people were made homeless after the storm in the country, 7 people died, and $92 million (1998 USD) in damage was brought by Mitch.

[ 299 ] [ 300 ] [ 301 ] Hurricane Joan killed 28 people and left 18 missing in the country, while leaving behind $65 million (1988 USD) in damage in 1998.

[ 302 ] [ 303 ] An unnamed tropical storm in 1887 and a tropical depression in 1973 are the only storms to make landfall in Costa Rica on record.

[ 304 ] [ 305 ] El Salvador [ edit ] In September 1982, a tropical depression moved ashore the El Salvador and Guatemala border, which later became Hurricane Paul . The depression dropped torrential rainfall that led to 761 fatalities.

[ 306 ] In October 1998, former Hurricane Mitch moved through the country as a tropical depression, causing US$400 million in damage and 240 deaths.

[ 307 ] In October 2017, Tropical Storm Selma became the first tropical storm on record to strike El Salvador.

[ 308 ] Guatemala [ edit ] In October 2005, rains from Hurricane Stan , along with a broader weather system, dropped torrential rainfall across Guatemala, causing widespread floods and landslides; the events led to 1,513 deaths and US$996 million in damage.

[ 309 ] [ 310 ] [ 311 ] Honduras [ edit ] Main article: Hurricanes in Honduras In September 1974, Hurricane Fifi paralleled the north coast of Honduras , triggering torrential rainfall that caused flooding and landslides. The storm inflicted US$1.8 billion in damage, producing the nation's worst natural disaster at the time. The death toll in the country was estimated between 8,000–10,000.

[ 312 ] [ 268 ] In October 1998, Hurricane Mitch stalled off shore Honduras before weakening, moving southward, and striking the country. Torrential rainfall in the country – estimated as high as 1,900 mm (75 in) in the mountains – caused flooding and landslides. The storm wrecked about 35,000 houses and damaged another 50,000, leaving up to 1.5 million people homeless, or about 20% of the country's population. Damage totaled over US$2 billion, and there were more than 7,000 fatalities.

[ 313 ] [ 314 ] [ 315 ] Nicaragua [ edit ] Hurricane Joan–Miriam prior to landfall on Nicaragua Main article: Hurricanes in Nicaragua Tropical cyclones make landfall in Nicaragua once every few years, usually from the Atlantic Ocean.

[ 304 ] In 1998, Hurricane Mitch brought extreme damage and destruction to the country. As much as 630 mm (25 in) of rain fell in some coastal areas, with this rain causing a lahar at the Casita volcano in northwestern Nicaragua.

[ 299 ] [ 300 ] A mudslide occurred as a result, which would grow to 16 km (9.9 mi) long and 8 km (5.0 mi) wide; in areas around the volcano, over 2,000 people died.

[ 300 ] Overall, at least 3,800 people died in Nicaragua from Mitch, 7,000 people were reported missing, and 500,000–800,000 people were left homeless after the storm.

[ 300 ] Damages in the country were estimated at $1 billion (1998 USD), making it the costliest hurricane on record in the country, in addition to the deadliest.

[ 300 ] In October 1988, Hurricane Joan made landfall on Nicaragua, just south of Bluefields .

[ 316 ] Bluefields was particularly hard hit, as almost all structures in the city were damaged, with many of the main buildings in the city having been destroyed.

[ 317 ] Overall, across Nicaragua, Joan killed 148 people and left 100 others missing; the storm caused $751 million (1988 USD) in damage in the country.

[ 317 ] Hurricane Felix made landfall in northern Nicaragua as a Category 5 hurricane during 2007, the first storm to do so in the country. 130 people died in Nicaragua as a result of Felix, and $716.3 million (2007 USD) in damage was reported.

[ 318 ] [ 319 ] During November 2020, hurricanes Eta and Iota made landfall in Nicaragua, both as Category 4 hurricanes. Eta caused $178.4 million (2020 USD) in damage and killed 2 people, [ 320 ] [ 321 ] while Iota was much more destructive, killing 28 people and causing $564 million (2020 USD) in damage.

[ 322 ] [ 323 ] [ 324 ] Tropical Storm Alma is the only tropical cyclone on record to make landfall on the Pacific coast of Nicaragua.

[ 325 ] Panama [ edit ] Hurricane Martha north of Panama as a strong tropical storm Only one tropical cyclone has ever made landfall on Panama in recorded history.

[ 326 ] In late November 1969, Hurricane Martha formed north of Panama, and took an unusual track south before eventually making landfall in the country. At least 330 mm (13 in) of rain fell in Almirante , flooding half of the land of the city, causing extensive crop damage.

[ 327 ] Armuelles reported continuous rain, which caused street flooding and inundation of other areas.

[ 327 ] In November 2020, hurricanes Eta and Iota impacted Panama; the former was the deadliest hurricane on record in the country, killing 19 people and leaving 12 more missing.

[ 328 ] Over 200 homes were damaged as a result of Eta, [ 329 ] and $11 million (2020 USD) in damages to agriculture was estimated in the country.

[ 330 ] In addition, Iota killed 3 people in Panama, and left 1 more missing.

[ 331 ] Hurricane Joan caused $60 million (1988 USD) in damages in Panama and killed 7 people in 1988, [ 332 ] mostly due to heavy rainfall and mudslides.

[ 317 ] In 2016, Hurricane Otto 's outer bands caused rainfall which led to landslides and flooding, which led to 6 people dying on Panamanian soil.

[ 333 ] Offshore from Colón , 3 people died when the ship Jessica sank; the other 3 crew on the ship were rescued.

[ 333 ] The precursor disturbance to Hurricane Nate in 2017 brought flooding rains and strong gusts to western and central parts of Panama.

[ 334 ] [ 335 ] 84 houses were damaged or destroyed in incidents related to Nate, [ 336 ] and 4,975 people were affected.

[ 337 ] A landslide in Ngäbe-Buglé Comarca killed 6 people, and another person died in a shipwreck in Panama Bay .

[ 338 ] [ 339 ] Hurricane Mitch in 1998 killed 3 people in Panama, [ 300 ] and caused $50,000 (1998 USD) in damages.

[ 340 ] Hurricane Beta 's outer bands brought heavy rain to Panama, resulting in flooding and landslides. At least 52 homes were damaged and 256 people were affected, but the monetary value of the damages is unknown.

[ 341 ] Three people died and two more were left missing in incidents related to Beta; a young girl died after a boat she was on sank, [ 342 ] two people drowned in the Chagres River after being swept away by it, [ 343 ] and two people were reported missing after they were shipwrecked.

[ 343 ] Islands in the North Atlantic Ocean [ edit ] Bermuda [ edit ] Hurricane Fabian approaching Bermuda as a Category 3 hurricane Main article: List of Bermuda hurricanes The island of Bermuda is located in the North Atlantic Ocean, about 1,000 km (620 mi) east-southeast of Cape Hatteras , North Carolina.

[ 344 ] Due to the small size of Bermuda, only 10 tropical cyclones have made direct landfalls in the territory since 1851, though many more storms have produced impacts.

[ 267 ] [ 345 ] In 2003, Hurricane Fabian passed 23 km (14 mi) west of Bermuda as a Category 3 hurricane with winds of 195 km/h (120 mph); the island entered the eastern eyewall of the hurricane.

[ 346 ] A maximum wind gust of 264 km/h (164 mph) was recorded at Bermuda Harbour Radio.

[ 346 ] A storm surge estimated at 3–3.5 m (9.8–11.5 ft) and waves of 7–10 m (23–33 ft) were reported during Fabian's passage.

[ 347 ] Approximately 25,000 of the 32,031 power customers on the island lost power as a result of Fabian.

[ 347 ] Fabian was the first hurricane since 1926 to cause a death on the island, [ 348 ] killing 4 people; [ 347 ] in addition, it also caused $300 million (2003 USD) in damage.

[ 346 ] In a span of 6 days in October 2014, hurricanes Fay and Gonzalo both made landfall on Bermuda, which led to 2014 becoming the first season to have multiple landfalls on Bermuda on record.

[ 349 ] Fay caused gusts well in excess of 160 km/h (100 mph) as a Category 1 hurricane at several higher elevation stations, with a peak of 198 km/h (123 mph) at Commissioner's Point.

[ 350 ] Nearly 28,000 of the 35,500 electricity customers on the island lost power as a result of Fay.

[ 351 ] A definite $3.8 million (2014 USD) in damage was recorded from Fay, though this number was from only one insurance company; [ 350 ] the Bermuda Weather Service estimated the total damages at "tens of millions of dollars".

[ 352 ] Gonzalo struck as a Category 2, causing gusts as high as 232 km/h (144 mph) on St. David's .

[ 349 ] Out of the 35,500 electricity customers on the island, 31,000 electricity customers were without power at the peak of the storm.

[ 353 ] In total, an estimated $200–400 million (2014 USD) in damage was recorded from Gonzalo.

[ 349 ] Impacts were very similar and hard to distinguish between both storms, though no deaths were reported from either storm.

[ 350 ] [ 349 ] A hurricane made landfall on Bermuda as a Category 3 hurricane in October 1926, with sustained winds as high as 183 km/h (114 mph) recorded at Fort Prospect .

[ 354 ] The storm killed about 110 people near Bermuda due to sinking two ships, HMS Valeria and the SS Eastway .

[ 354 ] [ 355 ] In July 1609, a hurricane was responsible for the first settlement on the island, when the British ship Sea Venture heading for Jamestown, Virginia became separated from her fleet. The crew ultimately found the island of Bermuda and ultimately purposefully ran the ship aground there.

[ citation needed ] Cayman Islands [ edit ] Main article: List of Cayman Islands hurricanes In November 1932, a powerful hurricane passed near the Cayman Islands, producing a storm surge that inundated the islands; 109 people died during the storm, making it the territory's deadliest hurricane.

[ 356 ] In September 2004, Hurricane Ivan passed just south of Grand Cayman as a Category 5 hurricane; it killed two people and inflicted US$2.86 billion in damage.

[ 357 ] [ 358 ] Cuba [ edit ] Main article: List of Cuba hurricanes In November 1932, a powerful hurricane struck southeastern Cuba. The hurricane washed away much of the town of Santa Cruz del Sur from its 6.5 m (21.3 ft) storm surge. Across Cuba, the storm killed 3,033 people, making it the country's deadliest hurricane.

[ 359 ] In October 1963, Hurricane Flora made landfall in southeastern Cuba, and over the next four days drifted across the country. Santiago de Cuba recorded 100.39 in (2,550 mm) of rainfall from Flora, which is the highest rainfall total measured on Cuba from any rainfall event on record. Flora killed 1,750 people and left US$300 million in damage.

[ 360 ] [ 361 ] In September 2017, Category 5 Hurricane Irma moved ashore the northern coast of Cuba, making it the first hurricane of such intensity to strike the island since 1924 . Irma damaged 158,554 homes, of which 14,657 were destroyed. Throughout the country, the hurricane inflicted US$13.185 billion in damage and killed 10 people, making Irma the costliest tropical cyclone in Cuban history.

[ 362 ] [ 363 ] [ 364 ] [ 365 ] Hispaniola [ edit ] Hurricane David at peak intensity shortly before landfall in the Dominican Republic Main article: Hurricanes in Hispaniola Hispaniola is an island holding the countries of the Dominican Republic and Haiti that is also the second largest island in the Caribbean. Hispaniola has the Caribbean Sea to its south, the Atlantic Ocean to its north, the Mona Passage to its east, and the Windward Passage to the west.

In October 1963, Hurricane Flora struck Haiti near Sud, causing between $185 million and $240 million (1964 USD, $1.5 billion - $2 billion 2020 USD) in damage, and killing 5,000 people. In August 1979 Hurricane David struck the Dominican Republic with 280 km/h (175 mph) winds, causing $1 billion in damage (1979 USD, $3.5 billion 2020 USD) and killing 2,000 people.

In the year of 2008, 4 tropical cyclones impacted Hispaniola, causing hundreds of million of dollars in damage and killing 704 people.

Fay made landfall in the Dominican Republic shortly after forming, killing 14 people.

[ 366 ] Gustav made landfall near Jacmel as a minimal hurricane, killing 85 people.

[ 367 ] Hanna , possibly the worst of the four, stalled north of Haiti, dropping more than a foot of rain in some places and killing 529.

[ 368 ] Finally, Ike passed north of Haiti, dropping heavy rainfall, and killing 76 people.

[ 369 ] Jamaica [ edit ] Hurricane Gilbert approaching Jamaica on September 12 Main article: List of Jamaica hurricanes The island and country of Jamaica is located in the Caribbean Sea, south of the eastern edge of Cuba.

Hurricane Gilbert in September 1988 was the strongest and most damaging storm on record to make landfall in Jamaica, leaving $800 million (1989 USD) in damage as a Category 3 with winds of 125 mph (201 km/h).

[ 370 ] A storm in 1722 was the deadliest on record in Jamaica, killing roughly 400 people.

[ 370 ] Lucayan Archipelago [ edit ] Satellite image of Hurricane Dorian at peak intensity while making landfall in the Abaco Islands on September 1, 2019, one of the strongest storms on record in the archipelago Main article: Hurricanes in the Bahama Archipelago The Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands make up the Lucayan Archipelago , also known as the Bahama Archipelago. The island group is located east of Florida and north of the Greater Antilles.

The Lucayan Archipelago has seen four Category 5 hurricanes strike there, being the 1932 Bahamas hurricane , the 1933 Cuba–Brownsville hurricane , Hurricane Andrew in 1992, and Hurricane Dorian in 2019.

Hurricane Dorian in August 2019 was the strongest, deadliest, and most damaging hurricane to hit The Bahamas in recorded history, making landfall on Great Abaco island with winds of 185 mph (298 km/h) and a central pressure of 910 millibars (26.87 inHg). Dorian killed 74 people, and caused US$2.5 billion in damages.

Puerto Rico [ edit ] Main article: List of Puerto Rico hurricanes The American territory of Puerto Rico has been struck by several significant hurricanes. In 1899, the San Ciriaco hurricane moved across the island, killing 3,369 people, making it the deadliest hurricane in the island's history.

[ 371 ] In 1928, a powerful hurricane struck the southeastern portion of the island as a Category 5 hurricane; it was the only hurricane of such intensity to strike the island.

[ 372 ] In September 2017, Hurricane Maria moved across the island, causing about US$90 billion in damage, as well as an island-wide power outage, making it the island's costliest natural disaster. The hurricane led to 2,975 deaths on the island.

[ 373 ] [ 374 ] South America [ edit ] Tropical storm bret hitting the coast of Venezuela Main article: List of South America tropical cyclones In the continent of South America , northern Colombia and Venezuela have a 1 to 5% chance of a hurricane strike in any given year.

[ 375 ] In August 1993, Tropical Storm Bret made landfall in Venezuela and killed 173 people.

[ 376 ] The South Atlantic Ocean is generally inhospitable to the formation of a tropical storm., [ 377 ] In June 2021, the predecessor extratropical cyclone of Subtropical Storm Raoni caused heavy rains and strong winds gust up to 104 km/h (65 mph), downing trees and causing damages to different public and private establishments across Punta del Este .

[ 378 ] The storm also brought rough surf, and downpours with continuous gales were also experienced in Uruguay 's capital Montevideo .

[ 378 ] From June 24 to July 2, Raoni channeled cold air from Antarctica into portions of South America , leading to an unusually potent cold wave across Argentina , Uruguay , Paraguay , Bolivia , and Brazil, with the temperature dropping as much as 15 °C (59 °F) below average in some areas. The combination of the cyclone and the cold wave also produced snowfall across the southern portion of South America, with snowfall observed as far north as southern Brazil, marking the 4th snowfall event observed there within the past century.

[ 379 ] Brazil [ edit ] Cyclone catarina affecting the coast of Brazil Main article: South Atlantic tropical cyclone Hurricanes and Tropical storms are rare in the South Atlantic Ocean but year around we can see some storms in the basin. Here we have some storms that impacted Brazil in the last years. On March 28, 2004, a system named Catarina impacted the Brazilian coast as a Category 2 hurricane killing 11 people and causing $ 350 million in damage. This was the first ever hurricane recorded in the South Atlantic. Cari brought heavy rainfall, flooding and landslides to eastern cities of Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul. A Navy buoy registered a 6- metre (20-foot) wave off the coast of Santa Catarina .The Front associated with Kurumí would later play a role in the 2020 Brazilian floods and mudslides , producing heavy rainfall on 24 January, triggering a landslide and killing 3 people and leaving 1 missing.The storm caused significant damage in Espírito Santo , with landslides of stones and earth leaving more than 400 people homeless. Mani impacted almost the entire state of Minas Gerais and the northern region of Rio de Janeiro .More than 220,000 people were affected by power cuts in greater Porto Alegre and Campanha Gaúcha because of the Cyclone . Several power poles and cables were broken, leaving residents in the dark. On Lake Guaíba , the storm damaged a boat carrying three people, resulting in one of them drowning. The system caused $50 million in damage across Brazil and Uruguay , becoming one of the costliest storms in the basin.
