**Noncommutative algebraic geometry** is a branch of [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), and more specifically a direction in [noncommutative geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noncommutative_geometry "Noncommutative geometry"), that studies the geometric properties of formal duals of [non-commutative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-commutative "Non-commutative")[algebraic objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra "Algebra") such as [rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_(mathematics) "Ring (mathematics)") as well as geometric objects derived from them (e.g. by gluing along localizations or taking noncommutative [stack quotients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_quotient "Stack quotient")).

For example, noncommutative algebraic geometry is supposed to extend a notion of an [algebraic scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(mathematics) "Scheme (mathematics)") by suitable gluing of spectra of noncommutative rings; depending on how literally and how generally this aim (and a notion of spectrum) is understood in noncommutative setting, this has been achieved in various level of success. The noncommutative ring generalizes here a commutative [ring of regular functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_of_regular_functions "Ring of regular functions") on a [commutative scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(mathematics) "Scheme (mathematics)"). Functions on usual spaces in the traditional (commutative) [algebraic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry "Algebraic geometry") have a product defined by [pointwise multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointwise_multiplication "Pointwise multiplication"); as the values of these functions [commute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_property "Commutative property"), the functions also commute: _a_ times _b_ equals _b_ times _a_. It is remarkable that viewing noncommutative associative algebras as algebras of functions on "noncommutative" would-be space is a far-reaching geometric intuition, though it formally looks like a fallacy.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

Much of the motivation for noncommutative geometry, and in particular for the noncommutative algebraic geometry, is from physics; especially from quantum physics, where the [algebras of observables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observables "Observables") are indeed viewed as noncommutative analogues of functions, hence having the ability to observe their geometric aspects is desirable.

One of the values of the field is that it also provides new techniques to study objects in commutative algebraic geometry such as [Brauer groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brauer_group "Brauer group").

The methods of noncommutative algebraic geometry are analogs of the methods of commutative algebraic geometry, but frequently the foundations are different. Local behavior in commutative algebraic geometry is captured by [commutative algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_algebra "Commutative algebra") and especially the study of [local rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_ring "Local ring"). These do not have a ring-theoretic analogue in the noncommutative setting; though in a categorical setup one can talk about [stacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(mathematics) "Stack (mathematics)") of local categories of [quasicoherent sheaves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasicoherent_sheaf "Quasicoherent sheaf") over noncommutative spectra. Global properties such as those arising from [homological algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homological_algebra "Homological algebra") and [K-theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-theory "K-theory") more frequently carry over to the noncommutative setting.

### Classical approach: the issue of non-commutative localization

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Noncommutative_algebraic_geometry&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Classical approach: the issue of non-commutative localization")]

Commutative algebraic geometry begins by constructing the [spectrum of a ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum_of_a_ring "Spectrum of a ring"). The points of the algebraic variety (or more generally, [scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(mathematics) "Scheme (mathematics)")) are the [prime ideals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_ideal "Prime ideal") of the ring, and the functions on the algebraic variety are the elements of the ring. A noncommutative ring, however, may not have any proper non-zero two-sided prime ideals. For instance, this is true of the [Weyl algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weyl_algebra "Weyl algebra") of polynomial [differential operators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_operator "Differential operator") on affine space: The Weyl algebra is a [simple ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_ring "Simple ring"). Therefore, one can for instance attempt to replace a prime spectrum by a [primitive spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_spectrum "Primitive spectrum"): there are also the theory of [non-commutative localization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-commutative_localization "Non-commutative localization") as well as [descent theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descent_theory "Descent theory"). This works to some extent: for instance, [Dixmier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dixmier "Dixmier")'s _enveloping algebras_ may be thought of as working out non-commutative algebraic geometry for the primitive spectrum of an enveloping algebra of a [Lie algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_algebra "Lie algebra"). Another work in a similar spirit is [Michael Artin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Artin "Michael Artin")’s notes titled “noncommutative rings”,[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noncommutative_algebraic_geometry#cite_note-1) which in part is an attempt to study [representation theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_theory "Representation theory") from a non-commutative-geometry point of view. The key insight to both approaches is that [irreducible representations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreducible_representations "Irreducible representations"), or at least [primitive ideals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_ideal "Primitive ideal"), can be thought of as “non-commutative points”.

### Modern viewpoint using categories of sheaves

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Noncommutative_algebraic_geometry&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Modern viewpoint using categories of sheaves")]

As it turned out, starting from, say, primitive spectra, it was not easy to develop a workable [sheaf theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheaf_theory "Sheaf theory"). One might imagine this difficulty is because of a sort of quantum phenomenon: points in a space can influence points far away (and in fact, it is not appropriate to treat points individually and view a space as a mere collection of the points).

Due to the above, one accepts a paradigm implicit in [Pierre Gabriel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Gabriel "Pierre Gabriel")'s thesis and partly justified by the [Gabriel–Rosenberg reconstruction theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel%E2%80%93Rosenberg_reconstruction_theorem "Gabriel–Rosenberg reconstruction theorem") (after [Pierre Gabriel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Gabriel "Pierre Gabriel") and [Alexander L. Rosenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_L._Rosenberg "Alexander L. Rosenberg")) that a commutative scheme can be reconstructed, up to isomorphism of schemes, solely from the [abelian category](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelian_category "Abelian category") of [quasicoherent sheaves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasicoherent_sheaf "Quasicoherent sheaf") on the scheme. [Alexander Grothendieck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Grothendieck "Alexander Grothendieck") taught that to do geometry one does not need a space, it is enough to have a category of sheaves on that would-be space; this idea has been transmitted to noncommutative algebra by [Yuri Manin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuri_Manin "Yuri Manin"). There are, a bit weaker, reconstruction theorems from the derived categories of (quasi)coherent sheaves motivating the **derived noncommutative algebraic geometry** (see just below).

### Derived algebraic geometry

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Noncommutative_algebraic_geometry&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Derived algebraic geometry")]

Perhaps the most recent approach is through the [deformation theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformation_theory "Deformation theory"), placing non-commutative algebraic geometry in the realm of [derived algebraic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derived_algebraic_geometry "Derived algebraic geometry").

As a motivating example, consider the one-dimensional [Weyl algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weyl_algebra "Weyl algebra") over the [complex numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number "Complex number")**C**. This is the quotient of the free ring **C**<_x_, _y_> by the relation

_xy_ - _yx_ = 1.
This ring represents the polynomial differential operators in a single variable _x_; _y_ stands in for the differential operator ∂_x_. This ring fits into a one-parameter family given by the relations _xy_ - _yx_ = α. When α is not zero, then this relation determines a ring isomorphic to the Weyl algebra. When α is zero, however, the relation is the commutativity relation for _x_ and _y_, and the resulting quotient ring is the polynomial ring in two variables, **C**[_x_, _y_]. Geometrically, the polynomial ring in two variables represents the two-dimensional [affine space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_space "Affine space")**A**2, so the existence of this one-parameter family says that _affine space admits non-commutative deformations to the space determined by the Weyl algebra._ This deformation is related to the [symbol of a differential operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbol_of_a_differential_operator "Symbol of a differential operator") and that **A**2 is the [cotangent bundle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotangent_bundle "Cotangent bundle") of the affine line. (Studying the Weyl algebra can lead to information about affine space: The [Dixmier conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dixmier_conjecture "Dixmier conjecture") about the Weyl algebra is equivalent to the [Jacobian conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobian_conjecture "Jacobian conjecture") about affine space.)

In this line of the approach, the notion of _[operad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operad "Operad")_, a set or space of operations, becomes prominent: in the introduction to ([Francis 2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noncommutative_algebraic_geometry#CITEREFFrancis2008)), Francis writes:

> We begin the study of certain _less_ commutative algebraic geometries. … algebraic geometry over [![Image 1: {\displaystyle {\mathcal {E}}_{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b51c26b17c2dd33bd88d7476e7c6e099bcccd416)-rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/En-ring "En-ring") can be thought of as interpolating between some derived theories of noncommutative and commutative algebraic geometries. As _n_ increases, these ![Image 2: {\displaystyle {\mathcal {E}}_{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b51c26b17c2dd33bd88d7476e7c6e099bcccd416)-algebras converge to the [derived algebraic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derived_algebraic_geometry "Derived algebraic geometry") of Toën-Vezzosi and [Lurie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Lurie "Jacob Lurie").

Proj of a noncommutative ring
-----------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Noncommutative_algebraic_geometry&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Proj of a noncommutative ring")]

One of the basic constructions in commutative algebraic geometry is the [Proj construction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proj_construction "Proj construction") of a [graded commutative ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graded_commutative_ring "Graded commutative ring"). This construction builds a [projective algebraic variety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_algebraic_variety "Projective algebraic variety") together with a [very ample line bundle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_ample_line_bundle "Very ample line bundle") whose [homogeneous coordinate ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_coordinate_ring "Homogeneous coordinate ring") is the original ring. Building the underlying topological space of the variety requires localizing the ring, but building sheaves on that space does not. By a theorem of [Jean-Pierre Serre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Pierre_Serre "Jean-Pierre Serre"), quasi-coherent sheaves on Proj of a graded ring are the same as graded modules over the ring up to finite dimensional factors. The philosophy of [topos theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topos_theory "Topos theory") promoted by [Alexander Grothendieck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Grothendieck "Alexander Grothendieck") says that the category of sheaves on a space can serve as the space itself. Consequently, in non-commutative algebraic geometry one often defines Proj in the following fashion: Let _R_ be a graded **C**-algebra, and let Mod-_R_ denote the category of graded right _R_-modules. Let _F_ denote the subcategory of Mod-_R_ consisting of all modules of finite length. Proj _R_ is defined to be the quotient of the abelian category Mod-_R_ by _F_. Equivalently, it is a [localization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Localization_of_a_category "Localization of a category") of Mod-_R_ in which two modules become isomorphic if, after taking their direct sums with appropriately chosen objects of _F_, they are isomorphic in Mod-_R_.

This approach leads to a theory of [non-commutative projective geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-commutative_projective_geometry "Non-commutative projective geometry"). A non-commutative smooth projective curve turns out to be a smooth commutative curve, but for singular curves or smooth higher-dimensional spaces, the non-commutative setting allows new objects.
