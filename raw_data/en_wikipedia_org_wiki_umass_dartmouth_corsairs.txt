Find sources: "University of Massachusetts Dartmouth" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( October 2016 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) The University of Massachusetts Dartmouth traces its roots to 1895 when the Massachusetts legislature chartered the New Bedford Textile School in New Bedford and the Bradford Durfee Textile School in Fall River . The New Bedford Textile School was renamed the "New Bedford Institute of Textiles and Technology", and the Bradford Durfee Textile School was renamed the "Bradford Durfee College of Technology".

[ 9 ] In 1962, the two schools were combined to create the "Southeastern Massachusetts Technological Institute", expanding to become "Southeastern Massachusetts University" by 1969.

The University sits on a 710 acre site acquired in the early 1960s.

[ 10 ] In 1964, the ground was broken on a unified campus not far from the Smith Mills section of Dartmouth between the two cities of New Bedford and Fall River. The Liberal Arts building was completed in 1966, the Science & Engineering building in 1969, and the other original buildings were finished by 1971. The main campus has been expanded several times, including the Cedar Dell residences (begun in 1987), the Dion Science & Engineering Building in 1989, the Charlton College of Business in 2004, the new apartment-style residence halls in 2005, and the Research Building in 2007.

[ 9 ] In 1991, SMU joined the UMass system and adopted its present name, the "University of Massachusetts Dartmouth". Since then, the university has expanded back into its original cities as well, with the Center for Innovation & Entrepreneurship, formerly Advanced Textiles & Manufacturing Center, [ 11 ] (2001, at the former Kerr Mill site in Fall River) and Professional and Continuing Education Center (2002, in the former Cherry & Webb building in Fall River), and the School for Marine Science and Technology (1996, adjacent to Fort Rodman in New Bedford), the Star Store visual arts building in New Bedford (2001) and a second Center for Professional and Continuing Education (2002, one block north on Purchase Street) in New Bedford.

[ citation needed ] The building architecture is similar to that of the Boston Government Service Center . Rudolph made both the exterior and interior of each building of rough concrete (béton brut), an essential element of the style known as Brutalism , and he endowed buildings with large windows. The stairs were made relatively short in height. Atria was also placed in the Liberal Arts and Science & Engineering buildings to give people a place to socialize between sections of the halls. These areas are also filled with hanging and potted indoor plants. The main door of each building faces towards the Robert Karam Campanile , keeping students within the academic life area, where buildings for classes are located. Large mounds of earth (berms) also stand between the parking lots, making the lots partially invisible from the original Academic Life area (though not from within some recent additions to it, such as the Charlton College of Business building). More recent buildings, most notably the Woodland Commons and residence halls south of the main campus, have been built to complement Rudolph's Late Modernist aesthetic.

[ citation needed ] UMass Dartmouth, Liberal Arts Building - North Side In October 2013, Travel and Leisure named the university one of the most mysterious campuses in the United States. It compared the library to a concrete spaceship, describing it as an icon of the Brutalist style of architecture that has been both beloved and derided since its construction in the 1960s.

[ 21 ] The university has large areas of undeveloped green space with numerous footpaths, including wooded areas, grasslands, wetlands, and ponds.
