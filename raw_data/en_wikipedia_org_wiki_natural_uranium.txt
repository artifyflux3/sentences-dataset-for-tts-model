Find sources: "Natural uranium" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( March 2013 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Natural uranium ( NU or U nat [ 1 ] ) is uranium with the same isotopic ratio as found in nature. It contains 0.711% uranium-235 , 99.284% uranium-238 , and a trace of uranium-234 by weight (0.0055%). Approximately 2.2% of its radioactivity comes from uranium-235, 48.6% from uranium-238, and 49.2% from uranium-234.

Natural uranium can be used to fuel both low- and high-power nuclear reactors . Historically, graphite-moderated reactors and heavy water -moderated reactors have been fueled with natural uranium in the pure metal (U) or uranium dioxide (UO 2 ) ceramic forms. However, experimental fuelings with uranium trioxide (UO 3 ) and triuranium octaoxide (U 3 O 8 ) have shown promise.

[ 2 ] The 0.72% uranium-235 is not sufficient to produce a self-sustaining critical chain reaction in light water reactors or nuclear weapons ; these applications must use enriched uranium . Nuclear weapons take a concentration of 90% uranium-235, and light water reactors require a concentration of roughly 3% uranium-235.

[ 3 ] Unenriched natural uranium is appropriate fuel for a heavy-water reactor , like a CANDU reactor .

On rare occasions, earlier in geologic history when uranium-235 was more abundant, uranium ore was found to have naturally engaged in fission, forming natural nuclear fission reactors . Uranium-235 decays at a faster rate ( half-life of 700 million years) compared to uranium-238, which decays extremely slowly (half-life of 4.5 billion years). Therefore, a billion years ago, there was more than double the uranium-235 compared to now.

During the Manhattan Project , the name Tuballoy was used to refer to natural uranium in the refined condition; this term is still in occasional use. Uranium was also codenamed "X-Metal" during World War II. Similarly, enriched uranium was referred to as Oralloy ( Oak Ridge alloy), and depleted uranium was referred to as Depletalloy (depleted alloy).
