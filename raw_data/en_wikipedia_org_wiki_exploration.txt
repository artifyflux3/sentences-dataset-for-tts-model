**Exploration** is the process of exploring, an activity which has some [expectation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expectation_(epistemic) "Expectation (epistemic)") of [discovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_(observation) "Discovery (observation)"). Organised exploration is largely a human activity, but exploratory activity is common to most organisms capable of directed [locomotion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_locomotion "Animal locomotion") and the ability to learn, and has been described in, amongst others, [social insects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_insect "Social insect") foraging behaviour, where feedback from returning individuals affects the activity of other members of the group.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration#cite_note-Biesmeijer_and_de_Vries_2001-1)

Geographical exploration, sometimes considered the default meaning for the more general term exploration, is the practice of discovering lands and regions of the planet Earth remote or relatively inaccessible from the origin of the explorer.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration#cite_note-RGS_2008-2) The surface of the Earth not covered by water has been relatively comprehensively explored, as access is generally relatively straightforward, but underwater and subterranean areas are far less known, and even at the surface, much is still to be discovered in detail in the more remote and inaccessible wilderness areas.

Two major eras of geographical exploration occurred in human history: The first, covering most of [Human](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human "Human") history, saw people [moving out of Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recent_African_origin_of_modern_humans "Recent African origin of modern humans"), settling in new lands, and developing distinct cultures in relative isolation.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration#cite_note-Fern%C3%A1ndez-Armesto_2007-3) Early explorers settled in Europe and Asia; about 14,000 years ago, some crossed the [Ice Age land bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_of_the_Americas "Settlement of the Americas") from Siberia to Alaska, and moved southwards to settle in the Americas.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration#cite_note-RGS_2008-2) For the most part, these cultures were ignorant of each other's existence.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration#cite_note-Fern%C3%A1ndez-Armesto_2007-3) The second period of exploration, occurring over the last 10,000 years, saw increased cross-cultural exchange through trade and exploration, and marked a new era of cultural intermingling, and more recently, convergence.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration#cite_note-Fern%C3%A1ndez-Armesto_2007-3)

Early writings about exploration date back to the 4th millennium B.C. in [ancient Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt "Ancient Egypt"). One of the earliest and most impactful thinkers on exploration was [Ptolemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy "Ptolemy") in the 2nd century AD. Between the 5th century and 15th century AD, most exploration was done by Chinese and Arab explorers. This was followed by the [Age of Discovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Discovery "Age of Discovery") after European scholars rediscovered the works of early Latin and Greek geographers. While the Age of Discovery was partly driven by land routes outside of Europe becoming unsafe,[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration#cite_note-Age_of_discovery-4) and a desire for conquest, the 17th century also saw exploration driven by nobler motives, including scientific discovery and the expansion of knowledge about the world.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration#cite_note-RGS_2008-2) This broader knowledge of the world's geography meant that people were able to make [world maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_map "World map"), depicting all land known. The first modern [atlas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas "Atlas") was the _[Theatrum Orbis Terrarum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatrum\_Orbis\_Terrarum "Theatrum Orbis Terrarum")_, published by [Abraham Ortelius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Ortelius "Abraham Ortelius"), which included a world map that depicted all of Earth's continents.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration#cite_note-GLO_Chapter_2-5): 32

Underwater exploration is the exploration of any [underwater environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underwater_environment "Underwater environment"), either by direct observation by the explorer, or by remote observation and measurement under the direction of the investigators. Systematic, targeted exploration, with simultaneous survey, and recording of data, followed by data processing, interpretation and publication, is the most effective method to increase understanding of the ocean and other underwater regions, so they can be effectively managed, conserved, regulated, and their resources discovered, accessed, and used. Less than 10% of the ocean has been mapped in any detail, even less has been visually [observed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation "Observation"), and the total diversity of life and distribution of populations is similarly incompletely known.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration#cite_note-NOAA/NOS-6)

Space exploration is the use of [astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy "Astronomy") and [space technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_technology "Space technology") to explore [outer space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_space "Outer space").[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration#cite_note-NASA-7) While the exploration of space is currently carried out mainly by [astronomers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomer "Astronomer") with [telescopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telescope "Telescope"), its physical exploration is conducted both by [uncrewed robotic space probes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotic_spacecraft "Robotic spacecraft") and [human spaceflight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight "Human spaceflight"). Space exploration, like its classical form [astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy "Astronomy"), is one of the main sources for [space science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_science "Space science").

While the observation of objects in space, known as astronomy, predates reliable [recorded history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recorded_history "Recorded history"), it was the development of large and relatively efficient [rockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket "Rocket") during the mid-twentieth century that allowed physical extraterrestrial exploration to become a reality. Common rationales for exploring space include advancing scientific research, national prestige, uniting different nations, ensuring the future survival of humanity, and developing military and strategic advantages against other countries.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration#cite_note-NYT-20150828-8)

Urban exploration is the exploration of manmade structures, usually abandoned ruins or hidden components of the manmade environment. Photography and historical interest/documentation are heavily featured in the hobby, sometimes involving trespassing onto private property.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration#cite_note-SFGATE_062008-9)

The activity presents various risks, including physical danger and, if done illegally and/or without permission, the possibility of arrest and punishment. Some activities associated with urban exploration violate local or regional laws and certain broadly interpreted [anti-terrorism laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-terrorism_legislation "Anti-terrorism legislation"), or can be considered [trespassing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trespass "Trespass") or invasion of privacy.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration#cite_note-trespassingUE_93009-10)

Traditionally, [mineral exploration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral_exploration "Mineral exploration") relied on direct observation of [mineralisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineralization_(geology) "Mineralization (geology)") in rock outcrops or in sediments. More recently, however, mineral exploration also includes the use of [geologic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geologic "Geologic"), [geophysical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysical "Geophysical"), and [geochemical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geochemical "Geochemical") tools to search for anomalies, which can narrow the search area. The area to be prospected should be covered sufficiently to minimize the risk of missing something important, but it can take into account previous experience that certain geological evidence correlates with a very low probability of finding the desired minerals. Other evidence indicates a high probability, making it efficient to concentrate on the areas of high probability when they are found, and for the skipping areas of very low probability. Once an anomaly has been identified and interpreted to be a prospect, more detailed exploration of the potential reserve can be done by soil sampling, drilling, seismic surveys, and similar methods to assess the most appropriate method and type of [mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining "Mining") and the economic potential.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration#cite_note-Britannica-11)

Systematic examination or investigation Systematic investigation is done in an orderly and organised manner, generally following a plan, though it should be a flexible plan, which is amenable to rational adaptation to suit circumstances, as the concept of exploration accepts the possibility of the unexpected being encountered, and the plan must survive such encounters to remain useful.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]Diagnostical examination[Diagnosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis "Diagnosis") is the identification of the nature and cause of a given phenomenon. Diagnosis is used in many different [disciplines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_discipline "Academic discipline"), such as medicine, [forensic science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_science "Forensic science") and engineering [failure analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure_analysis "Failure analysis"), with variations in the use of logic, [analytics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytics "Analytics"), and experience, to determine [causality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality "Causality").[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration#cite_note-Greg_Stanley-12) A diagnostic examination explores the available evidence to try to identify likely causes for observed effects, and may also investigate further with the intention to discover additional relevant evidence. This is an instance of inspective and extrinsic exploration.To seek experience first hand Exploration as the pursuit of first hand experience and knowledge is often an example of diversive and intrinsic exploration when done for personal satisfaction and entertainment, though it may also be for purposes of learning or verifying the information provided by others, which is an extrinsic motivation, and which is likely to be characterised by a relatively systematic approach. As the personal aspect of the experience is central to this type of exploration, the same region or range of experiences may be explored repeatedly by different people, for each can have a reasonable expectation of personal discovery.Exploratory behavior in animals[Exploratory behavior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_behavior "Exploratory behavior") has been defined as behavior directed toward getting information about the environment,[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration#cite_note-Meyer_1998-13) or to locate things such as food or individuals. Exploration usually follows a sequence, in which four stages can be identified.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration#cite_note-mousebehavior-14) The first phase is search, in which the subject moves around to contact relevant stimuli, to which the subject pays attention, and may approach and investigate. The sequence may be interrupted by flight if danger is recognised, or a return to search if the stimulus is not interesting or useful.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration#cite_note-mousebehavior_search-15)[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration#cite_note-mousebehavior_investigate-16)[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration#cite_note-mousebehavior_attend-17)[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration#cite_note-mousebehavior_approach-18)
In all these definitions there is an implication of novelty, or unfamiliarity or the expectation of discovery in the exploration, whereas a [survey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survey_(disambiguation) "Survey (disambiguation)") implies directed examination, but not necessarily discovery of any previously unknown or unexpected information. The activities are not mutually exclusive, and often occur simultaneously to a variable extent. The same field of investigation or region may be explored at different times by different explorers with different motivations, who may make similar or different discoveries.
