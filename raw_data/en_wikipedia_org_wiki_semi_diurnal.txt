A diurnal cycle (or diel cycle ) is any pattern that recurs every 24 hours as a result of one full rotation of the planet Earth around its axis.

[ 1 ] Earth's rotation causes surface temperature fluctuations throughout the day and night, as well as weather changes throughout the year. The diurnal cycle depends mainly on incoming solar radiation .

[ 2 ] Climate and atmosphere [ edit ] Diurnal variation of air temperature (blue) lag by 3 to 4 hours behind insolation at solar noon (red).

In climatology , the diurnal cycle is one of the most basic forms of climate patterns , including variations in diurnal temperature and rainfall.

[ 1 ] Diurnal cycles may be approximately sinusoidal or include components of a truncated sinusoid (due to the Sun's rising and setting) and thermal relaxation ( Newton cooling ) at night.

[ 1 ] The diurnal cycle also has a great impact on carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere , due to processes such as photosynthesis and cellular respiration .

[ 3 ] Biological effects [ edit ] Diurnal cycles of light and temperature can result in similar cycles in biological processes, such as photosynthesis in plants [ 3 ] and clinical depression in humans.

[ 4 ] Plant responses to environmental cycles may even induce indirect cycles in rhizosphere microbial activities, including nitrogen fixation .

[ 5 ] Semi-diurnal cycle [ edit ] There are typically three different types of tides: diurnal, which has one high tide and one low tide each day; semi-diurnal, which has two high tides and one low tide each day; and mixed, which has two high tides and two low tides each day with varying heights.

Map of areas with the different tidal cycles.

A semi-diurnal cycle refers to a pattern that occurs about every twelve hours or about twice a day. Often these can be related to lunar tides , in which case the interval is closer to 12 hours and 25 minutes.
