Find sources: "Conserved quantity" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( March 2020 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) A conserved quantity is a property or value that remains constant over time in a system even when changes occur in the system. In mathematics , a conserved quantity of a dynamical system is formally defined as a function of the dependent variables , the value of which remains constant along each trajectory of the system.

[ 1 ] Not all systems have conserved quantities, and conserved quantities are not unique, since one can always produce another such quantity by applying a suitable function , such as adding a constant, to a conserved quantity.

Since many laws of physics express some kind of conservation , conserved quantities commonly exist in mathematical models of physical systems . For example, any classical mechanics model will have mechanical energy as a conserved quantity as long as the forces involved are conservative .

Differential equations [ edit ] Main article: Differential equation For a first order system of differential equations d r d t = f ( r , t ) {\displaystyle {\frac {d\mathbf {r} }{dt}}=\mathbf {f} (\mathbf {r} ,t)} where bold indicates vector quantities, a scalar-valued function H ( r ) is a conserved quantity of the system if, for all time and initial conditions in some specific domain, d H d t = 0 {\displaystyle {\frac {dH}{dt}}=0} Note that by using the multivariate chain rule , d H d t = ∇ ∇ H ⋅ ⋅ d r d t = ∇ ∇ H ⋅ ⋅ f ( r , t ) {\displaystyle {\frac {dH}{dt}}=\nabla H\cdot {\frac {d\mathbf {r} }{dt}}=\nabla H\cdot \mathbf {f} (\mathbf {r} ,t)} so that the definition may be written as ∇ ∇ H ⋅ ⋅ f ( r , t ) = 0 {\displaystyle \nabla H\cdot \mathbf {f} (\mathbf {r} ,t)=0} which contains information specific to the system and can be helpful in finding conserved quantities, or establishing whether or not a conserved quantity exists.

Hamiltonian mechanics [ edit ] Main article: Hamiltonian mechanics For a system defined by the Hamiltonian H {\displaystyle {\mathcal {H}}} , a function f of the generalized coordinates q and generalized momenta p has time evolution d f d t = { f , H } + ∂ ∂ f ∂ ∂ t {\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} f}{\mathrm {d} t}}=\{f,{\mathcal {H}}\}+{\frac {\partial f}{\partial t}}} and hence is conserved if and only if { f , H } + ∂ ∂ f ∂ ∂ t = 0 {\textstyle \{f,{\mathcal {H}}\}+{\frac {\partial f}{\partial t}}=0} . Here { f , H } {\displaystyle \{f,{\mathcal {H}}\}} denotes the Poisson bracket .

Lagrangian mechanics [ edit ] Main article: Lagrangian mechanics Suppose a system is defined by the Lagrangian L with generalized coordinates q . If L has no explicit time dependence (so ∂ ∂ L ∂ ∂ t = 0 {\textstyle {\frac {\partial L}{\partial t}}=0} ), then the energy E defined by E = ∑ ∑ i [ q ˙ ˙ i ∂ ∂ L ∂ ∂ q ˙ ˙ i ] − − L {\displaystyle E=\sum _{i}\left[{\dot {q}}_{i}{\frac {\partial L}{\partial {\dot {q}}_{i}}}\right]-L} is conserved.

Furthermore, if ∂ ∂ L ∂ ∂ q = 0 {\textstyle {\frac {\partial L}{\partial q}}=0} , then q is said to be a cyclic coordinate and the generalized momentum p defined by p = ∂ ∂ L ∂ ∂ q ˙ ˙ {\displaystyle p={\frac {\partial L}{\partial {\dot {q}}}}} is conserved. This may be derived by using the Euler–Lagrange equations .
