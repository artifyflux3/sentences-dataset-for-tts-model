_V_, _I_, and _R_, the parameters of Ohm's law

**Ohm's law** states that the [electric current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current "Electric current") through a [conductor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_conductor "Electrical conductor") between two [points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node_(circuits) "Node (circuits)") is directly [proportional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportionality_(mathematics) "Proportionality (mathematics)") to the [voltage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage "Voltage") across the two points. Introducing the constant of proportionality, the [resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance "Electrical resistance"),[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm's_law#cite_note-1) one arrives at the three mathematical equations used to describe this relationship:[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm's_law#cite_note-Millikan-2)

![Image 2: {\displaystyle V=IR\quad {\text{or}}\quad I={\frac {V}{R}}\quad {\text{or}}\quad R={\frac {V}{I}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/82f60ad76f6070b71c9c4a60536f84b0d8c8534c)

where _I_ is the current through the conductor, _V_ is the voltage measured across the conductor and _R_ is the [resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance "Electrical resistance") of the conductor. More specifically, Ohm's law states that the _R_ in this relation is constant, independent of the current.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm's_law#cite_note-3) If the resistance is not constant, the previous equation cannot be called _Ohm's law_, but it can still be used as a definition of [static/DC resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance_and_conductance#Static_and_differential_resistance "Electrical resistance and conductance").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm's_law#cite_note-4) Ohm's law is an [empirical relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_law "Empirical law") which accurately describes the conductivity of the vast majority of [electrically conductive materials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_conductor "Electrical conductor") over many orders of magnitude of current. However some materials do not obey Ohm's law; these are called [non-ohmic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-ohmic_resistance "Non-ohmic resistance").

The law was named after the German physicist [Georg Ohm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Ohm "Georg Ohm"), who, in a treatise published in 1827, described measurements of applied voltage and current through simple electrical circuits containing various lengths of wire. Ohm explained his experimental results by a slightly more complex equation than the modern form above (see _[§History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm's\_law#History)_ below).

In physics, the term _Ohm's law_ is also used to refer to various generalizations of the law; for example the [vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(mathematics_and_physics) "Vector (mathematics and physics)") form of the law used in [electromagnetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetics "Electromagnetics") and material science:

![Image 3: {\displaystyle \mathbf {J} =\sigma \mathbf {E} ,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/389fc9cdfa516cd9fcb22f4a731f8ecb7fadd683)

where **J** is the [current density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_density "Current density") at a given location in a resistive material, **E** is the electric field at that location, and _σ_ ([sigma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigma "Sigma")) is a material-dependent parameter called the [conductivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_conductivity "Electrical conductivity"), defined as the [inverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_function "Inverse function") of [resistivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistivity_and_conductivity "Electrical resistivity and conductivity")_ρ_ ([rho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rho "Rho")). This reformulation of Ohm's law is due to [Gustav Kirchhoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav_Kirchhoff "Gustav Kirchhoff").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm's_law#cite_note-5)

[Georg Ohm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Ohm "Georg Ohm")

In January 1781, before [Georg Ohm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Ohm "Georg Ohm")'s work, [Henry Cavendish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Cavendish "Henry Cavendish") experimented with [Leyden jars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leyden_jar "Leyden jar") and glass tubes of varying diameter and length filled with salt solution. He measured the current by noting how strong a shock he felt as he completed the circuit with his body. Cavendish wrote that the "velocity" (current) varied directly as the "degree of electrification" (voltage). He did not communicate his results to other scientists at the time,[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm's_law#cite_note-eb-6) and his results were unknown until [James Clerk Maxwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell "James Clerk Maxwell") published them in 1879.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm's_law#cite_note-7)

[Francis Ronalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Ronalds "Francis Ronalds") delineated "intensity" (voltage) and "quantity" (current) for the [dry pile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltaic_pile#Dry_piles "Voltaic pile")—a high voltage source—in 1814 using a [gold-leaf electrometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrometer#Gold-leaf_electroscope "Electrometer"). He found for a dry pile that the relationship between the two parameters was not proportional under certain meteorological conditions.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm's_law#cite_note-8)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm's_law#cite_note-9)

Ohm did his work on resistance in the years 1825 and 1826, and published his results in 1827 as the book _Die galvanische Kette, mathematisch bearbeitet_ ("The galvanic circuit investigated mathematically").[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm's_law#cite_note-10) He drew considerable inspiration from [Joseph Fourier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Fourier "Joseph Fourier")'s work on heat conduction in the theoretical explanation of his work. For experiments, he initially used [voltaic piles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltaic_pile "Voltaic pile"), but later used a [thermocouple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermocouple "Thermocouple") as this provided a more stable voltage source in terms of internal resistance and constant voltage. He used a galvanometer to measure current, and knew that the voltage between the thermocouple terminals was proportional to the junction temperature. He then added test wires of varying length, diameter, and material to complete the circuit. He found that his data could be modeled through the equation ![Image 5: {\displaystyle x={\frac {a}{b+\ell }},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1ac27b6c33e9945792e431751eb4d721d6d34402) where _x_ was the reading from the [galvanometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galvanometer "Galvanometer"), _ℓ_ was the length of the test conductor, _a_ depended on the thermocouple junction temperature, and _b_ was a constant of the entire setup. From this, Ohm determined his law of proportionality and published his results.

Internal resistance model

In modern notation we would write, ![Image 7: {\displaystyle I={\frac {\mathcal {E}}{r+R}},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5af9eb7526a8c2e8b3fd61f2521db26dced911e9) where ![Image 8: {\displaystyle {\mathcal {E}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9c298ed828ff778065aeb5f0f305097f55bb9ae0) is the open-circuit [emf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromotive_force "Electromotive force") of the thermocouple, ![Image 9: {\displaystyle r}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0d1ecb613aa2984f0576f70f86650b7c2a132538) is the [internal resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_resistance "Internal resistance") of the thermocouple and ![Image 10: {\displaystyle R}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4b0bfb3769bf24d80e15374dc37b0441e2616e33) is the resistance of the test wire. In terms of the length of the wire this becomes, ![Image 11: {\displaystyle I={\frac {\mathcal {E}}{r+{\mathcal {R}}\ell }},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8ea986aba37d023efd6bb95f22334cd868e675cd) where ![Image 12: {\displaystyle {\mathcal {R}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/74532dc308c806964b832df0d0d73352195c2f2f) is the resistance of the test wire per unit length. Thus, Ohm's coefficients are, ![Image 13: {\displaystyle a={\frac {\mathcal {E}}{\mathcal {R}}},\quad b={\frac {\mathcal {r}}{\mathcal {R}}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5f3248bf70fcf636843ddf3536a3acd7fa7c93a7)

Ohm's law in Georg Ohm's lab book.

Ohm's law was probably the most important of the early quantitative descriptions of the physics of electricity. We consider it almost obvious today. When Ohm first published his work, this was not the case; critics reacted to his treatment of the subject with hostility. They called his work a "web of naked fancies"[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm's_law#cite_note-11) and the Minister of Education proclaimed that "a professor who preached such heresies was unworthy to teach science."[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm's_law#cite_note-12) The prevailing scientific philosophy in Germany at the time asserted that experiments need not be performed to develop an understanding of nature because nature is so well ordered, and that scientific truths may be deduced through reasoning alone.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm's_law#cite_note-13) Also, Ohm's brother Martin, a mathematician, was battling the German educational system. These factors hindered the acceptance of Ohm's work, and his work did not become widely accepted until the 1840s. However, Ohm received recognition for his contributions to science well before he died.

In the 1850s, Ohm's law was widely known and considered proved. Alternatives such as "[Barlow's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barlow%27s_law "Barlow's law")", were discredited, in terms of real applications to telegraph system design, as discussed by [Samuel F. B. Morse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_F._B._Morse "Samuel F. B. Morse") in 1855.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm's_law#cite_note-14)

The [electron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron "Electron") was discovered in 1897 by [J. J. Thomson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._J._Thomson "J. J. Thomson"), and it was quickly realized that it was the particle ([charge carrier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge_carrier "Charge carrier")) that carried electric currents in electric circuits. In 1900, the first ([classical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_physics "Classical physics")) model of electrical conduction, the [Drude model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drude_model "Drude model"), was proposed by [Paul Drude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Drude "Paul Drude"), which finally gave a scientific explanation for Ohm's law. In this model, a solid conductor consists of a stationary lattice of [atoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom "Atom") ([ions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion "Ion")), with [conduction electrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conduction_electron "Conduction electron") moving randomly in it. A voltage across a conductor causes an [electric field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_field "Electric field"), which accelerates the electrons in the direction of the electric field, causing a drift of electrons which is the electric current. However the electrons collide with atoms which causes them to scatter and randomizes their motion, thus converting kinetic energy to [heat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat "Heat") ([thermal energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_energy "Thermal energy")). Using statistical distributions, it can be shown that the average drift velocity of the electrons, and thus the current, is proportional to the electric field, and thus the voltage, over a wide range of voltages.

The development of [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics") in the 1920s modified this picture somewhat, but in modern theories the average drift velocity of electrons can still be shown to be proportional to the electric field, thus deriving Ohm's law. In 1927 [Arnold Sommerfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Sommerfeld "Arnold Sommerfeld") applied the quantum [Fermi-Dirac distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi-Dirac_distribution "Fermi-Dirac distribution") of electron energies to the Drude model, resulting in the [free electron model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_electron_model "Free electron model"). A year later, [Felix Bloch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Bloch "Felix Bloch") showed that electrons move in waves ([Bloch electrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloch_electron "Bloch electron")) through a solid crystal lattice, so scattering off the lattice atoms as postulated in the Drude model is not a major process; the electrons scatter off impurity atoms and defects in the material. The final successor, the modern quantum [band theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Band_theory "Band theory") of solids, showed that the electrons in a solid cannot take on any energy as assumed in the Drude model but are restricted to energy bands, with gaps between them of energies that electrons are forbidden to have. The size of the band gap is a characteristic of a particular substance which has a great deal to do with its electrical resistivity, explaining why some substances are [electrical conductors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_conductor "Electrical conductor"), some [semiconductors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor "Semiconductor"), and some [insulators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulator_(electricity) "Insulator (electricity)").

While the old term for electrical conductance, the [mho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siemens_(unit) "Siemens (unit)") (the inverse of the resistance unit ohm), is still used, a new name, the [siemens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siemens_(unit) "Siemens (unit)"), was adopted in 1971, honoring [Ernst Werner von Siemens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Werner_von_Siemens "Ernst Werner von Siemens"). The siemens is preferred in formal papers.

In the 1920s, it was discovered that the current through a practical resistor actually has statistical fluctuations, which depend on temperature, even when voltage and resistance are exactly constant; this fluctuation, now known as [Johnson–Nyquist noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson%E2%80%93Nyquist_noise "Johnson–Nyquist noise"), is due to the discrete nature of charge. This thermal effect implies that measurements of current and voltage that are taken over sufficiently short periods of time will yield ratios of V/I that fluctuate from the value of R implied by the time average or [ensemble average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_average "Ensemble average") of the measured current; Ohm's law remains correct for the average current, in the case of ordinary resistive materials.

Ohm's work long preceded [Maxwell's equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations "Maxwell's equations") and any understanding of frequency-dependent effects in AC circuits. Modern developments in electromagnetic theory and circuit theory do not contradict Ohm's law when they are evaluated within the appropriate limits.

Scope
-----

Ohm's law is an [empirical law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_law "Empirical law"), a generalization from many experiments that have shown that current is approximately proportional to electric field for most materials. It is less fundamental than [Maxwell's equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations "Maxwell's equations") and is not always obeyed. Any given material will [break down](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_breakdown "Electrical breakdown") under a strong-enough electric field, and some materials of interest in electrical engineering are "non-ohmic" under weak fields.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm's_law#cite_note-15)[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm's_law#cite_note-16)

Ohm's law has been observed on a wide range of length scales. In the early 20th century, it was thought that Ohm's law would fail at the [atomic scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_spacing "Atomic spacing"), but experiments have not borne out this expectation. As of 2012, researchers have demonstrated that Ohm's law works for [silicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon "Silicon") wires as small as four atoms wide and one atom high.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm's_law#cite_note-17)

Microscopic origins
-------------------

[![Image 15](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/Electrona_in_crystallo_fluentia.svg/250px-Electrona_in_crystallo_fluentia.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Electrona_in_crystallo_fluentia.svg)

Drude Model electrons (shown here in blue) constantly bounce among heavier, stationary crystal ions (shown in red).

The dependence of the current density on the applied electric field is essentially [quantum mechanical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics") in nature; (see Classical and quantum conductivity.) A qualitative description leading to Ohm's law can be based upon [classical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics "Classical mechanics") using the [Drude model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drude_model "Drude model") developed by [Paul Drude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Drude "Paul Drude") in 1900.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm's_law#cite_note-18)[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm's_law#cite_note-19)

The Drude model treats [electrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron "Electron") (or other charge carriers) like pinballs bouncing among the [ions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion "Ion") that make up the structure of the material. Electrons will be accelerated in the opposite direction to the electric field by the average electric field at their location. With each collision, though, the electron is deflected in a random direction with a velocity that is much larger than the velocity gained by the electric field. The net result is that electrons take a zigzag path due to the collisions, but generally drift in a direction opposing the electric field.

The [drift velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drift_velocity "Drift velocity") then determines the electric [current density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_density "Current density") and its relationship to _**E**_ and is independent of the collisions. Drude calculated the average drift velocity from _**p**_=−_e**E**τ_ where _**p**_ is the average [momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum "Momentum"), −_e_ is the charge of the electron and τ is the average time between the collisions. Since both the momentum and the current density are proportional to the drift velocity, the current density becomes proportional to the applied electric field; this leads to Ohm's law.

Hydraulic analogy
-----------------

A [hydraulic analogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic_analogy "Hydraulic analogy") is sometimes used to describe Ohm's law. Water pressure, measured by [pascals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(unit) "Pascal (unit)") (or [PSI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pounds_per_square_inch "Pounds per square inch")), is the analog of voltage because establishing a water pressure difference between two points along a (horizontal) pipe causes water to flow. The water volume flow rate, as in [liters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liter "Liter") per second, is the analog of current, as in [coulombs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coulomb "Coulomb") per second. Finally, flow restrictors—such as apertures placed in pipes between points where the water pressure is measured—are the analog of resistors. We say that the rate of water flow through an aperture restrictor is proportional to the difference in water pressure across the restrictor. Similarly, the rate of flow of electrical charge, that is, the electric current, through an electrical resistor is proportional to the difference in voltage measured across the resistor. More generally, the [hydraulic head](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic_head "Hydraulic head") may be taken as the analog of voltage, and Ohm's law is then analogous to [Darcy's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darcy%27s_law "Darcy's law") which relates hydraulic head to the volume flow rate via the [hydraulic conductivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic_conductivity "Hydraulic conductivity").

Flow and pressure variables can be calculated in fluid flow network with the use of the hydraulic ohm analogy.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm's_law#cite_note-20)[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm's_law#cite_note-21) The method can be applied to both steady and transient flow situations. In the linear [laminar flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laminar_flow "Laminar flow") region, [Poiseuille's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poiseuille%27s_law "Poiseuille's law") describes the hydraulic resistance of a pipe, but in the [turbulent flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbulent_flow "Turbulent flow") region the pressure–flow relations become nonlinear.

The hydraulic analogy to Ohm's law has been used, for example, to approximate blood flow through the circulatory system.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm's_law#cite_note-22)

Circuit analysis

Ohm's law wheel with international unit symbols

In [circuit analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_analysis "Circuit analysis"), three equivalent expressions of Ohm's law are used interchangeably:

![Image 18: {\displaystyle I={\frac {V}{R}}\quad {\text{or}}\quad V=IR\quad {\text{or}}\quad R={\frac {V}{I}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/74540cf41241949caaa632d5db5825b5db49821f)

Each equation is quoted by some sources as the defining relationship of Ohm's law,[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm's_law#cite_note-Millikan-2)[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm's_law#cite_note-23)[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm's_law#cite_note-24) or all three are quoted,[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm's_law#cite_note-25) or derived from a proportional form,[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm's_law#cite_note-26) or even just the two that do not correspond to Ohm's original statement may sometimes be given.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm's_law#cite_note-27)[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm's_law#cite_note-28)

The interchangeability of the equation may be represented by a triangle, where _V_ ([voltage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage "Voltage")) is placed on the top section, the _I_ ([current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current "Electric current")) is placed to the left section, and the _R_ ([resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance "Electrical resistance")) is placed to the right. The divider between the top and bottom sections indicates division (hence the division bar).

### Resistive circuits

[Resistors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistor "Resistor") are circuit elements that impede the passage of [electric charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge "Electric charge") in agreement with Ohm's law, and are designed to have a specific resistance value _R_. In schematic diagrams, a resistor is shown as a long rectangle or zig-zag symbol. An element (resistor or conductor) that behaves according to Ohm's law over some operating range is referred to as an _ohmic device_ (or an _ohmic resistor_) because Ohm's law and a single value for the resistance suffice to describe the behavior of the device over that range.

Ohm's law holds for circuits containing only resistive elements (no capacitances or inductances) for all forms of driving voltage or current, regardless of whether the driving voltage or current is constant ([DC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_current "Direct current")) or time-varying such as [AC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternating_current "Alternating current"). At any instant of time Ohm's law is valid for such circuits.

Resistors which are in _[series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series\_and\_parallel\_circuits#Series\_circuits "Series and parallel circuits")_ or in _[parallel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series\_and\_parallel\_circuits#Parallel\_circuits "Series and parallel circuits")_ may be grouped together into a single "equivalent resistance" in order to apply Ohm's law in analyzing the circuit.

### Reactive circuits with time-varying signals

When reactive elements such as capacitors, inductors, or transmission lines are involved in a circuit to which AC or time-varying voltage or current is applied, the relationship between voltage and current becomes the solution to a [differential equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation "Differential equation"), so Ohm's law (as defined above) does not directly apply since that form contains only resistances having value _R_, not complex impedances which may contain capacitance (_C_) or inductance (_L_).

Equations for [time-invariant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-invariant "Time-invariant")[AC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternating_current "Alternating current") circuits take the same form as Ohm's law. However, the variables are generalized to [complex numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number "Complex number") and the current and voltage waveforms are [complex exponentials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_exponential "Complex exponential").[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm's_law#cite_note-29)

In this approach, a voltage or current waveform takes the form _Ae_ _st_, where _t_ is time, _s_ is a complex parameter, and _A_ is a complex scalar. In any [linear time-invariant system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LTI_system_theory "LTI system theory"), all of the currents and voltages can be expressed with the same _s_ parameter as the input to the system, allowing the time-varying complex exponential term to be canceled out and the system described algebraically in terms of the complex scalars in the current and voltage waveforms.

The complex generalization of resistance is [impedance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_impedance "Electrical impedance"), usually denoted _Z_; it can be shown that for an inductor, ![Image 19: {\displaystyle Z=sL}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b46f1310390cdc3d86e6dad6d352d56a755d87fd) and for a capacitor, ![Image 20: {\displaystyle Z={\frac {1}{sC}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9783594a8eb773816d5d93ef42b17256e8745001)

We can now write, ![Image 21: {\displaystyle V=Z\,I}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/911add68981c450b012d162ad37de44f223264e1) where _V_ and _I_ are the complex scalars in the voltage and current respectively and _Z_ is the complex impedance.

This form of Ohm's law, with _Z_ taking the place of _R_, generalizes the simpler form. When _Z_ is complex, only the real part is responsible for dissipating heat.

In a general AC circuit, _Z_ varies strongly with the frequency parameter _s_, and so also will the relationship between voltage and current.

For the common case of a steady [sinusoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_wave "Sine wave"), the _s_ parameter is taken to be ![Image 22: {\displaystyle j\omega }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/635692523e5a0d8187e908408819010da7f0bd09), corresponding to a complex sinusoid ![Image 23: {\displaystyle Ae^{{\mbox{ }}j\omega t}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4d3febca5c3fa66998b97795c2372e42271d85ca). The real parts of such complex current and voltage waveforms describe the actual sinusoidal currents and voltages in a circuit, which can be in different phases due to the different complex scalars.

### Linear approximations

Ohm's law is one of the basic equations used in the [analysis of electrical circuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_analysis_(electrical_circuits) "Network analysis (electrical circuits)"). It applies to both metal conductors and circuit components ([resistors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistor "Resistor")) specifically made for this behaviour. Both are ubiquitous in electrical engineering. Materials and components that obey Ohm's law are described as "ohmic"[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm's_law#cite_note-30) which means they produce the same value for resistance (_R_ = _V_/_I_) regardless of the value of _V_ or _I_ which is applied and whether the applied voltage or current is DC ([direct current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_current "Direct current")) of either positive or negative polarity or AC ([alternating current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternating_current "Alternating current")).

In a true ohmic device, the same value of resistance will be calculated from _R_ = _V_/_I_ regardless of the value of the applied voltage _V_. That is, the ratio of _V_/_I_ is constant, and when current is plotted as a function of voltage the curve is _linear_ (a straight line). If voltage is forced to some value _V_, then that voltage _V_ divided by measured current _I_ will equal _R_. Or if the current is forced to some value _I_, then the measured voltage _V_ divided by that current _I_ is also _R_. Since the plot of _I_ versus _V_ is a straight line, then it is also true that for any set of two different voltages _V_ 1 and _V_ 2 applied across a given device of resistance _R_, producing currents _I_ 1 = _V_ 1/_R_ and _I_ 2 = _V_ 2/_R_, that the ratio (_V_ 1 − _V_ 2)/(_I_ 1 − _I_ 2) is also a constant equal to _R_. The operator "delta" (Δ) is used to represent a difference in a quantity, so we can write Δ _V_ = _V_ 1 − _V_ 2 and Δ _I_ = _I_ 1 − _I_ 2. Summarizing, for any truly ohmic device having resistance _R_, _V_/_I_ = Δ _V_/Δ _I_ = _R_ for any applied voltage or current or for the difference between any set of applied voltages or currents.

[![Image 24](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/FourIVcurves.svg/500px-FourIVcurves.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:FourIVcurves.svg)

The [_I_–_V_ curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current%E2%80%93voltage_characteristic "Current–voltage characteristic") of four devices: Two [resistors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistor "Resistor"), a [diode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diode "Diode"), and a [battery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(electricity) "Battery (electricity)"). The two resistors follow Ohm's law: The plot is a straight line through the origin. The other two devices do _not_ follow Ohm's law.

There are, however, components of electrical circuits which do not obey Ohm's law; that is, their relationship between current and voltage (their [_I_–_V_ curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current%E2%80%93voltage_characteristic "Current–voltage characteristic")) is _nonlinear_ (or non-ohmic). An example is the [p–n junction diode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diode#Shockley_diode_equation "Diode") (curve at right). As seen in the figure, the current does not increase linearly with applied voltage for a diode. One can determine a value of current (_I_) for a given value of applied voltage (_V_) from the curve, but not from Ohm's law, since the value of "resistance" is not constant as a function of applied voltage. Further, the current only increases significantly if the applied voltage is positive, not negative. The ratio _V_/_I_ for some point along the nonlinear curve is sometimes called the _static_, or _chordal_, or [DC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_current "Direct current"), resistance,[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm's_law#cite_note-31)[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm's_law#cite_note-32) but as seen in the figure the value of total _V_ over total _I_ varies depending on the particular point along the nonlinear curve which is chosen. This means the "DC resistance" V/I at some point on the curve is not the same as what would be determined by applying an AC signal having peak amplitude Δ _V_ volts or Δ _I_ amps centered at that same point along the curve and measuring Δ _V_/Δ _I_. However, in some diode applications, the AC signal applied to the device is small and it is possible to analyze the circuit in terms of the _dynamic_, _small-signal_, or _incremental_ resistance, defined as the one over the slope of the _V_–_I_ curve at the average value (DC operating point) of the voltage (that is, one over the [derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative "Derivative") of current with respect to voltage). For sufficiently small signals, the dynamic resistance allows the Ohm's law small signal resistance to be calculated as approximately one over the slope of a line drawn tangentially to the _V_–_I_ curve at the DC operating point.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm's_law#cite_note-horowitz-hill-33)

Temperature effects
-------------------

Ohm's law has sometimes been stated as, "for a conductor in a given state, the electromotive force is proportional to the current produced. "That is, that the resistance, the ratio of the applied [electromotive force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromotive_force "Electromotive force") (or voltage) to the current, "does not vary with the current strength."The qualifier "in a given state" is usually interpreted as meaning "at a constant temperature," since the resistivity of materials is usually temperature dependent. Because the conduction of current is related to [Joule heating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joule_heating "Joule heating") of the conducting body, according to [Joule's first law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joule%27s_first_law "Joule's first law"), the temperature of a conducting body may change when it carries a current. The dependence of resistance on temperature therefore makes resistance depend upon the current in a typical experimental setup, making the law in this form difficult to directly verify. [Maxwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell "James Clerk Maxwell") and others worked out several methods to test the law experimentally in 1876, controlling for heating effects.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm's_law#cite_note-34) Usually, the measurements of a sample resistance are carried out at low currents to prevent Joule heating. However, even a small current causes heating(cooling) at the first(second) sample contact due to the [Peltier effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peltier_effect "Peltier effect"). The temperatures at the sample contacts become different, their difference is linear in current. The voltage drop across the circuit includes additionally the Seebeck thermoelectromotive force which again is again linear in current. As a result, there exists a thermal correction to the sample resistance even at negligibly small current.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm's_law#cite_note-35) The magnitude of the correction could be comparable with the sample resistance.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm's_law#cite_note-36)

Relation to heat conductions
----------------------------

Ohm's principle predicts the flow of electrical charge (i.e. current) in electrical conductors when subjected to the influence of voltage differences; [Jean-Baptiste-Joseph Fourier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Baptiste_Joseph_Fourier "Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier")'s principle predicts the flow of [heat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat "Heat") in heat conductors when subjected to the influence of temperature differences.

The same equation describes both phenomena, the equation's variables taking on different meanings in the two cases. Specifically, solving a heat conduction (Fourier) problem with _[temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature "Temperature")_ (the driving "force") and _[flux of heat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flux "Flux")_ (the rate of flow of the driven "quantity", i.e. heat energy) variables also solves an analogous [electrical conduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_conduction "Electrical conduction") (Ohm) problem having _[electric potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric\_potential "Electric potential")_ (the driving "force") and _[electric current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric\_current "Electric current")_ (the rate of flow of the driven "quantity", i.e. charge) variables.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm's_law#cite_note-37)

The basis of Fourier's work was his clear conception and definition of [thermal conductivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_conductivity "Thermal conductivity"). He assumed that, all else being the same, the flux of heat is strictly proportional to the gradient of temperature. Although undoubtedly true for small temperature gradients, strictly proportional behavior will be lost when real materials (e.g. ones having a thermal conductivity that is a function of temperature) are subjected to large temperature gradients.

A similar assumption is made in the statement of Ohm's law: other things being alike, the strength of the current at each point is proportional to the gradient of electric potential. The accuracy of the assumption that flow is proportional to the gradient is more readily tested, using modern measurement methods, for the electrical case than for the heat case.

Other versions
--------------

Ohm's law, in the form above, is an extremely useful equation in the field of electrical/electronic engineering because it describes how voltage, current and resistance are interrelated on a "macroscopic" level, that is, commonly, as circuit elements in an [electrical circuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_circuit "Electrical circuit"). Physicists who study the electrical properties of matter at the microscopic level use a closely related and more general [vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(mathematics_and_physics) "Vector (mathematics and physics)") equation, sometimes also referred to as Ohm's law, having variables that are closely related to the V, I, and R [scalar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_(mathematics) "Scalar (mathematics)") variables of Ohm's law, but which are each functions of position within the conductor. Physicists often use this continuum form of Ohm's Law:[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm's_law#cite_note-38)

![Image 25: {\displaystyle \mathbf {E} =\rho \mathbf {J} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1d02b2210cf1a2a16529a584d970b6e54d9190d8)

where **E** is the [electric field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_field "Electric field") vector with units of volts per meter (analogous to V of Ohm's law which has units of volts), **J** is the [current density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_density "Current density") vector with units of amperes per unit area (analogous to I of Ohm's law which has units of amperes), and ρ "[rho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rho "Rho")" is the [resistivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistivity "Resistivity") with units of ohm·meters (analogous to R of Ohm's law which has units of ohms). The above equation is also written[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm's_law#cite_note-39) as **J** = _σ_**E** where σ "[sigma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigma "Sigma")" is the [conductivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_conductivity "Electrical conductivity") which is the reciprocal of ρ.

[![Image 26](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/Ohms_law_vectors.svg/330px-Ohms_law_vectors.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ohms_law_vectors.svg)

Current flowing through a uniform cylindrical conductor (such as a round wire) with a uniform field applied.

The voltage between two points is defined as:[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm's_law#cite_note-40)![Image 27: {\displaystyle {\Delta V}=-\int {\mathbf {E} \cdot d{\boldsymbol {\ell }}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/af40191de7cf9aeffd8851dcc630df593b586dbd) with ![Image 28: {\displaystyle d{\boldsymbol {\ell }}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d4e31ccb56216886cf7c82bb9a470e803c3c96f9) the element of path along the integration of electric field vector **E**. If the applied **E** field is uniform and oriented along the length of the conductor as shown in the figure, then defining the voltage V in the usual convention of being opposite in direction to the field (see figure), and with the understanding that the voltage V is measured differentially across the length of the conductor allowing us to drop the Δ symbol, the above vector equation reduces to the scalar equation:

![Image 29: {\displaystyle V={E}{\ell }\ \ {\text{or}}\ \ E={\frac {V}{\ell }}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2b839023af4423c10e7f56538f4ede3c666a5de2)

Since the **E** field is uniform in the direction of wire length, for a conductor having uniformly consistent resistivity ρ, the current density **J** will also be uniform in any cross-sectional area and oriented in the direction of wire length, so we may write:[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm's_law#cite_note-lerner732-41)![Image 30: {\displaystyle J={\frac {I}{a}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/478ea10595b9d79193abc317543636d301628f24)

Substituting the above 2 results (for _E_ and _J_ respectively) into the continuum form shown at the beginning of this section: ![Image 31: {\displaystyle {\frac {V}{\ell }}={\frac {I}{a}}\rho \qquad {\text{or}}\qquad V=I\rho {\frac {\ell }{a}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/de2f3e4f3d0bffa763035049182dc482e9ac7dca)

The [electrical resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance "Electrical resistance") of a uniform conductor is given in terms of [resistivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistivity "Resistivity") by:[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm's_law#cite_note-lerner732-41)![Image 32: {\displaystyle {R}=\rho {\frac {\ell }{a}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b562ed9d3678237c2de6d5e4933a6b17584a2c01) where _ℓ_ is the length of the conductor in [SI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units "International System of Units") units of meters, a is the cross-sectional area (for a round wire _a_ = _πr_ 2 if r is radius) in units of meters squared, and ρ is the resistivity in units of ohm·meters.

After substitution of _R_ from the above equation into the equation preceding it, the continuum form of Ohm's law for a uniform field (and uniform current density) oriented along the length of the conductor reduces to the more familiar form: ![Image 33: {\displaystyle V=IR.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7b1211b14bd36f5941aa434a9e2b5ade6239d4ad)

A perfect crystal lattice, with low enough thermal motion and no deviations from periodic structure, would have no [resistivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistivity "Resistivity"),[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm's_law#cite_note-42) but a real metal has [crystallographic defects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystallographic_defect "Crystallographic defect"), impurities, multiple [isotopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope "Isotope"), and thermal motion of the atoms. Electrons [scatter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattering "Scattering") from all of these, resulting in resistance to their flow.

The more complex generalized forms of Ohm's law are important to [condensed matter physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condensed_matter_physics "Condensed matter physics"), which studies the properties of [matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter "Matter") and, in particular, its [electronic structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_structure "Electronic structure"). In broad terms, they fall under the topic of [constitutive equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutive_equations "Constitutive equations") and the theory of [transport coefficients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green%E2%80%93Kubo_relations "Green–Kubo relations").

### Magnetic effects

If an external **B**-field is present and the conductor is not at rest but moving at velocity **v**, then an extra term must be added to account for the current induced by the [Lorentz force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_force "Lorentz force") on the charge carriers. ![Image 34: {\displaystyle \mathbf {J} =\sigma (\mathbf {E} +\mathbf {v} \times \mathbf {B} )}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6ece65140769e5dd0a588ef25878b5d9ce5da3c8)

In the [rest frame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rest_frame "Rest frame") of the moving conductor this term drops out because **v** = 0. There is no contradiction because the electric field in the rest frame differs from the **E**-field in the lab frame: **E′** = **E** + **v** × **B**. Electric and magnetic fields are relative, see [Lorentz transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_transformation "Lorentz transformation").

If the current **J** is alternating because the applied voltage or **E**-field varies in time, then reactance must be added to resistance to account for self-inductance, see [electrical impedance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_impedance "Electrical impedance"). The reactance may be strong if the frequency is high or the conductor is coiled.

### Conductive fluids

In a conductive fluid, such as a [plasma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics) "Plasma (physics)"), there is a similar effect. Consider a fluid moving with the velocity ![Image 35: {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/35c1866e359fbfd2e0f606c725ba5cc37a5195d6) in a magnetic field ![Image 36: {\displaystyle \mathbf {B} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/cafb0ef39b0f5ffa23c170aa7f7b4e718327c4d1). The relative motion induces an electric field ![Image 37: {\displaystyle \mathbf {E} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0d7f22b39d51f780fc02859059c1757c606b9de2) which exerts [electric force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_force "Electric force") on the charged particles giving rise to an [electric current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current "Electric current")![Image 38: {\displaystyle \mathbf {J} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7686846b1a6b756cb514954000004ab5e7b2a5ba). The equation of motion for the electron gas, with a [number density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_density "Number density")![Image 39: {\displaystyle n_{e}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5e21303faca6e2167f4ecbf2a75aed982e817035), is written as ![Image 40: {\displaystyle m_{e}n_{e}{d\mathbf {v} _{e} \over dt}=-n_{e}e\mathbf {E} +n_{e}m_{e}\nu (\mathbf {v} _{i}-\mathbf {v} _{e})-en_{e}\mathbf {v} _{e}\times \mathbf {B} ,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4c89a9a03645623b7f9580cae2102575ac5e07e3)

where ![Image 41: {\displaystyle e}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/cd253103f0876afc68ebead27a5aa9867d927467), ![Image 42: {\displaystyle m_{e}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8303b668e94e02d8f3db8c5b3ebd069ca5da9ba5) and ![Image 43: {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} _{e}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/879e0a35ee8b17fd7c103e05c888019965c85714) are the charge, mass and velocity of the electrons, respectively. Also, ![Image 44: {\displaystyle \nu }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c15bbbb971240cf328aba572178f091684585468) is the frequency of collisions of the electrons with ions which have a velocity field ![Image 45: {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} _{i}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/51747274b58895dd357bb270ba1b5cb71e4fa355). Since, the electron has a very small mass compared with that of ions, we can ignore the left hand side of the above equation to write ![Image 46: {\displaystyle \sigma (\mathbf {E} +\mathbf {v} \times \mathbf {B} )=\mathbf {J} ,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/cb03e31c9c59ad1ad58aa131fda35204db28fd60)

where we have used the definition of the [current density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_density "Current density"), and also put ![Image 47: {\displaystyle \sigma ={n_{e}e^{2} \over \nu m_{e}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7c7edefdb15d79c297af10380c781937c6363c7c) which is the [electrical conductivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_conductivity "Electrical conductivity"). This equation can also be equivalently written as ![Image 48: {\displaystyle \mathbf {E} +\mathbf {v} \times \mathbf {B} =\rho \mathbf {J} ,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a272b694f59b2f860952c0a4fb98fd179c8d2a96) where ![Image 49: {\displaystyle \rho =\sigma ^{-1}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3ed1183d99b24468cfed93c799e3c3b24de7b878) is the [electrical resistivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistivity "Electrical resistivity"). It is also common to write ![Image 50: {\displaystyle \eta }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e4d701857cf5fbec133eebaf94deadf722537f64) instead of ![Image 51: {\displaystyle \rho }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1f7d439671d1289b6a816e6af7a304be40608d64) which can be confusing since it is the same notation used for the magnetic diffusivity defined as ![Image 52: {\displaystyle \eta =1/\mu _{0}\sigma }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/21d3b2fbdd0e06b1c84463928b2697e09bddb21e).
