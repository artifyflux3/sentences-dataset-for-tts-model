A [steam turbine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_turbine "Steam turbine") with the case opened, an example of [energy technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_technology "Energy technology")

**Technology** is the application of [conceptual knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model "Conceptual model") to achieve practical [goals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal "Goal"), especially in a [reproducible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducible "Reproducible") way.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-1) The word _technology_ can also mean the products resulting from such efforts,[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-3) including both tangible [tools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool "Tool") such as [utensils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitchen_utensil "Kitchen utensil") or [machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine "Machine"), and intangible ones such as [software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software "Software"). Technology plays a critical role in [science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science "Science"), [engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering "Engineering"), and [everyday life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everyday_life "Everyday life").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-4)

Technological advancements have led to significant changes in society. The earliest known technology is the [stone tool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_tool "Stone tool"), used during [prehistory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prehistory "Prehistory"), followed by the [control of fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_of_fire "Control of fire")—which in turn contributed to the [growth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_size "Brain size") of the [human brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_brain "Human brain") and the development of [language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language "Language") during the [Ice Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleistocene "Pleistocene"), according to the [cooking hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooking_hypothesis "Cooking hypothesis").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-5) The invention of the [wheel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel "Wheel") in the [Bronze Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Age "Bronze Age") allowed greater travel and the creation of more complex machines. More recent technological inventions, including the [printing press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing_press "Printing press"), telephone, and the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet "Internet"), have lowered barriers to communication and ushered in the [knowledge economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_economy "Knowledge economy").

While technology contributes to [economic development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_development "Economic development") and improves human [prosperity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosperity "Prosperity"), it can also have negative impacts like [pollution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution "Pollution") and [resource depletion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_depletion "Resource depletion"), and can cause social harms like [technological unemployment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_unemployment "Technological unemployment") resulting from [automation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation "Automation"). As a result, philosophical and [political debates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_and_technology "Politics and technology") about the role and use of technology, the [ethics of technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_technology "Ethics of technology"), and ways to mitigate its downsides are ongoing.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-6)

Etymology
---------

_Technology_ is a term dating back to the [early 17th century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance "Renaissance") that meant 'systematic treatment' (from [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek "Ancient Greek")Τεχνολογία, from the [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language "Greek language"): [τέχνη](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CF%84%CE%AD%CF%87%CE%BD%CE%B7#Greek "wikt:τέχνη"), [romanized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Greek "Romanization of Greek"):_tékhnē_, [lit.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literal_translation "Literal translation")'craft, art' and [-λογία](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-%CE%BB%CE%BF%CE%B3%CE%AF%CE%B1#Ancient_Greek "wikt:-λογία") (_-logíā_), 'study, knowledge')._[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite\_note-Liddell\_1980-7)_[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-8) It is predated in use by the [Ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek "Ancient Greek") word [τέχνη](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CF%84%CE%AD%CF%87%CE%BD%CE%B7#Ancient_Greek "wikt:τέχνη") (_tékhnē_), used to mean 'knowledge of how to make things', which encompassed activities like architecture.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-9)

Starting in the 19th century, continental Europeans started using the terms _Technik_ (German) or _technique_ (French) to refer to a 'way of doing', which included all technical arts, such as dancing, navigation, or printing, whether or not they required tools or instruments.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-FOOTNOTESalomon1984114%E2%80%93115-10) At the time, _Technologie_ (German and French) referred either to the academic discipline studying the "methods of arts and crafts", or to the political discipline "intended to legislate on the functions of the arts and crafts."[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-FOOTNOTESalomon1984117-11) The distinction between _Technik_ and _Technologie_ is absent in English, and so both were translated as _technology_. The term was previously uncommon in English and mostly referred to the academic discipline, as in the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology "Massachusetts Institute of Technology").[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-jstor40061169-12)

In the 20th century, as a result of [scientific progress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progress "Progress") and the [Second Industrial Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Industrial_Revolution "Second Industrial Revolution"), _technology_ stopped being considered a distinct academic discipline and took on the meaning: the systemic use of knowledge to practical ends.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-13)

History
-------

### Prehistoric

[![Image 2: refer to caption](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/Faustkeil_Nachbau%2C_2020_PD_a-7.jpg/250px-Faustkeil_Nachbau%2C_2020_PD_a-7.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Faustkeil_Nachbau,_2020_PD_a-7.jpg)

A person holding a [hand axe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand_axe "Hand axe")

Tools were initially developed by [hominids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hominids "Hominids") through observation and [trial and error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_and_error "Trial and error").[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-14) Around 2 [Mya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year#Abbreviations_yr_and_ya "Year") (million years ago), they learned to make the first stone tools by hammering flakes off a pebble, forming a sharp [hand axe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand_axe "Hand axe").[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-:3-15) This practice was refined 75 kya (thousand years ago) into [pressure flaking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure_flaking "Pressure flaking"), enabling much finer work.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-16)

The [discovery of fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_of_fire "Discovery of fire") was described by [Charles Darwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin "Charles Darwin") as "possibly the greatest ever made by man".[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-17) Archaeological, dietary, and social evidence point to "continuous [human] fire-use" at least 1.5 Mya.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-18) Fire, fueled with wood and [charcoal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charcoal "Charcoal"), allowed early humans to cook their food to increase its digestibility, improving its nutrient value and broadening the number of foods that could be eaten.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-19) The _[cooking hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control\_of\_fire\_by\_early\_humans#The\_cooking\_hypothesis "Control of fire by early humans")_ proposes that the ability to cook promoted an increase in hominid [brain size](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_size "Brain size"), though some researchers find the evidence inconclusive.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-20) Archaeological evidence of [hearths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearth "Hearth") was dated to 790 kya; researchers believe this is likely to have intensified human [socialization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialization "Socialization") and may have contributed to the emergence of [language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language "Language").[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-worldcat1124046527-21)[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-20030715nytimes-science-22)

Other technological advances made during the Paleolithic era include clothing and shelter.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-:4-23) No consensus exists on the approximate time of adoption of either technology, but archaeologists have found archaeological evidence of clothing 90-120 kya[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-24) and shelter 450 kya.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-:4-23) As the Paleolithic era progressed, dwellings became more sophisticated and more elaborate; as early as 380 kya, humans were constructing temporary wood huts.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-25)[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-26) Clothing, adapted from the fur and hides of hunted animals, helped humanity expand into colder regions; humans began to [migrate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_human_migrations "Early human migrations") out of Africa around 200 kya, initially moving to [Eurasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasia "Eurasia").[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-27)[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-28)[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-29)

### Neolithic

[![Image 3: Photo of Neolithic tools on display](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/N%C3%A9olithique_0001.jpg/250px-N%C3%A9olithique_0001.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:N%C3%A9olithique_0001.jpg)

An array of Neolithic artifacts, including bracelets, axe heads, chisels, and polishing tools

The [Neolithic Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic_Revolution "Neolithic Revolution") (or _First Agricultural Revolution_) brought about an acceleration of technological innovation, and a consequent increase in social complexity.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-30) The invention of the polished [stone axe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand_axe "Hand axe") was a major advance that allowed large-scale [forest clearance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_clearance "Forest clearance") and farming.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-31) This use of polished stone axes increased greatly in the Neolithic but was originally used in the preceding [Mesolithic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesolithic "Mesolithic") in some areas such as Ireland.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-32) Agriculture fed larger populations, and the transition to [sedentism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedentism "Sedentism") allowed for the simultaneous raising of more children, as infants no longer needed to be carried around by [nomads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomad "Nomad"). Additionally, children could contribute labor to the raising of crops more readily than they could participate in [hunter-gatherer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter-gatherer "Hunter-gatherer") activities.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-20060104sciencedaily-33)[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-34)

With this increase in population and availability of labor came an increase in [labor specialization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_specialization "Labor specialization").[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-35) What triggered the progression from early Neolithic villages to the first cities, such as [Uruk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruk "Uruk"), and the first civilizations, such as [Sumer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumer "Sumer"), is not specifically known; however, the emergence of increasingly [hierarchical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical "Hierarchical") social structures and specialized labor, of trade and war among adjacent cultures, and the need for collective action to overcome environmental challenges such as [irrigation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrigation "Irrigation"), are all thought to have played a role.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-36)

The invention of [writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_writing "History of writing") led to the spread of cultural knowledge and became the basis for history, [libraries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libraries "Libraries"), schools, and [scientific](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific "Scientific") research.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-37)

Continuing improvements led to the [furnace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallurgical_furnace "Metallurgical furnace") and [bellows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellows "Bellows") and provided, for the first time, the ability to [smelt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smelting "Smelting") and [forge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forging "Forging") gold, copper, silver, and lead– native metals found in relatively pure form in nature.[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-38) The advantages of copper tools over stone, bone and wooden tools were quickly apparent to early humans, and native copper was probably used from near the beginning of [Neolithic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic "Neolithic") times (about 10 kya).[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-39) Native copper does not naturally occur in large amounts, but copper ores are quite common and some of them produce metal easily when burned in wood or charcoal fires. Eventually, the working of metals led to the discovery of [alloys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alloys "Alloys") such as [bronze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze "Bronze") and [brass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brass "Brass") (about 4,000 BCE). The first use of iron alloys such as steel dates to around 1,800 BCE.[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-40)[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-hindu001200903261-41)

### Ancient

After harnessing fire, humans discovered other forms of energy. The earliest known use of wind power is the [sailing ship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailing_ship "Sailing ship"); the earliest record of a ship under sail is that of a Nile boat dating to around 7,000 BCE.[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-42) From prehistoric times, Egyptians likely used the power of the annual [flooding of the Nile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flooding_of_the_Nile "Flooding of the Nile") to irrigate their lands, gradually learning to regulate much of it through purposely built irrigation channels and "catch" basins.[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-43) The ancient [Sumerians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumer "Sumer") in [Mesopotamia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesopotamia "Mesopotamia") used a complex system of canals and levees to divert water from the [Tigris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tigris "Tigris") and [Euphrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphrates "Euphrates") rivers for irrigation.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-44)

Archaeologists estimate that the wheel was invented independently and concurrently in Mesopotamia (in present-day [Iraq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq "Iraq")), the Northern Caucasus ([Maykop culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maykop_culture "Maykop culture")), and Central Europe.[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-45) Time estimates range from 5,500 to 3,000 BCE with most experts putting it closer to 4,000 BCE.[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-46) The oldest artifacts with drawings depicting wheeled carts date from about 3,500 BCE.[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-47) More recently, the oldest-known wooden wheel in the world as of 2024 was found in the [Ljubljana Marsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ljubljana_Marsh "Ljubljana Marsh") of [Slovenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia "Slovenia"); Austrian experts have established that the wheel is between 5,100 and 5,350 years old.[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-48)

The invention of the wheel revolutionized trade and war. It did not take long to discover that wheeled wagons could be used to carry heavy loads. The ancient Sumerians used a [potter's wheel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potter%27s_wheel "Potter's wheel") and may have invented it.[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-Kramer1963-49) A stone pottery wheel found in the city-state of [Ur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ur "Ur") dates to around 3,429 BCE,[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-Moorey1994-50) and even older fragments of wheel-thrown pottery have been found in the same area.[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-Moorey1994-50) Fast (rotary) potters' wheels enabled early [mass production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_production "Mass production") of pottery, but it was the use of the wheel as a transformer of energy (through [water wheels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_wheel "Water wheel"), windmills, and even treadmills) that revolutionized the application of nonhuman power sources. The first two-wheeled carts were derived from [travois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travois "Travois")[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-Lay1992-51) and were first used in Mesopotamia and [Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran "Iran") in around 3,000 BCE.[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-Lay1992-51)

The oldest known constructed roadways are the stone-paved streets of the city-state of Ur, dating to c. 4,000 BCE,[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-Gregersen2012-52) and timber roads leading through the swamps of [Glastonbury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glastonbury "Glastonbury"), England, dating to around the same period.[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-Gregersen2012-52) The first long-distance road, which came into use around 3,500 BCE,[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-Gregersen2012-52) spanned 2,400 km from the [Persian Gulf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_Gulf "Persian Gulf") to the [Mediterranean Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea "Mediterranean Sea"),[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-Gregersen2012-52) but was not paved and was only partially maintained.[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-Gregersen2012-52) In around 2,000 BCE, the [Minoans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minoans "Minoans") on the Greek island of [Crete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crete "Crete") built a 50 km road leading from the palace of [Gortyn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gortyn "Gortyn") on the south side of the island, through the mountains, to the palace of [Knossos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knossos "Knossos") on the north side of the island.[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-Gregersen2012-52) Unlike the earlier road, the Minoan road was completely paved.[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-Gregersen2012-52)

Ancient Minoan private homes had [running water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tap_water "Tap water").[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-Eslamian2014-54) A bathtub virtually identical to modern ones was unearthed at the Palace of Knossos.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-Eslamian2014-54)[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-Lechner2012-55) Several Minoan private homes also had toilets, which could be flushed by pouring water down the drain.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-Eslamian2014-54) The ancient Romans had many public flush toilets,[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-Lechner2012-55) which emptied into an extensive [sewage system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage_system "Sewage system").[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-Lechner2012-55) The primary sewer in Rome was the [Cloaca Maxima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloaca_Maxima "Cloaca Maxima");[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-Lechner2012-55) construction began on it in the sixth century BCE and it is still in use today.[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-Lechner2012-55)

The ancient Romans also had a complex system of [aqueducts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqueduct_(bridge) "Aqueduct (bridge)"),[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-Aicher1995-53) which were used to transport water across long distances.[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-Aicher1995-53) The first [Roman aqueduct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_aqueduct "Roman aqueduct") was built in 312 BCE.[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-Aicher1995-53) The eleventh and final ancient Roman aqueduct was built in 226 CE.[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-Aicher1995-53) Put together, the Roman aqueducts extended over 450 km,[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-Aicher1995-53) but less than 70 km of this was above ground and supported by arches.[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-Aicher1995-53)

### Pre-modern

Innovations continued through the [Middle Ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages "Middle Ages") with the introduction of silk production (in Asia and later Europe), the [horse collar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_collar "Horse collar"), and [horseshoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horseshoe "Horseshoe"). [Simple machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_machine "Simple machine") (such as the [lever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lever "Lever"), the [screw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw "Screw"), and the [pulley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulley "Pulley")) were combined into more complicated tools, such as the [wheelbarrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheelbarrow "Wheelbarrow"), [windmills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windmill "Windmill"), and [clocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock "Clock").[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-56) A system of universities developed and spread scientific ideas and practices, including [Oxford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Oxford "University of Oxford") and [Cambridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge "University of Cambridge").[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-57)

The [Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_technology "Renaissance technology") era produced many innovations, including the introduction of the [movable type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movable_type "Movable type")[printing press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing_press "Printing press") to Europe, which facilitated the communication of knowledge. Technology became increasingly influenced by science, beginning a cycle of mutual advancement.[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-58)

### Modern

The [automobile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile "Automobile"), here the original [Benz Patent-Motorwagen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benz_Patent-Motorwagen "Benz Patent-Motorwagen"), revolutionized personal transportation.

Starting in the United Kingdom in the 18th century, the discovery of [steam power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_power "Steam power") set off the [Industrial Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution "Industrial Revolution"), which saw wide-ranging technological discoveries, particularly in the areas of [agriculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Agricultural_Revolution "British Agricultural Revolution"), manufacturing, mining, [metallurgy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallurgy "Metallurgy"), and transport, and the widespread application of the [factory system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_system "Factory system").[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-59) This was followed a century later by the [Second Industrial Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Industrial_Revolution "Second Industrial Revolution") which led to rapid scientific discovery, standardization, and mass production. New technologies were developed, including [sewage systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage_treatment "Sewage treatment"), electricity, [light bulbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_bulbs "Light bulbs"), [electric motors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_motor "Electric motor"), railroads, [automobiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobiles "Automobiles"), and airplanes. These technological advances led to significant developments in medicine, [chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry "Chemistry"), [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics"), and engineering.[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-60) They were accompanied by consequential social change, with the introduction of skyscrapers accompanied by rapid urbanization.[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-61) Communication improved with the invention of the [telegraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegraph "Telegraph"), the telephone, the radio, and television.[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-62)

The 20th century brought a host of innovations. In physics, the discovery of [nuclear fission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fission "Nuclear fission") in the [Atomic Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_Age "Atomic Age") led to both [nuclear weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapons "Nuclear weapons") and [nuclear power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power "Nuclear power"). [Analog computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_computer "Analog computer") were invented and asserted dominance in processing complex data. While the invention of [vacuum tubes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_tube "Vacuum tube") allowed for digital computing with [computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer "Computer") like the [ENIAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC "ENIAC"), their sheer size precluded widespread use until innovations in [quantum physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_physics "Quantum physics") allowed for the invention of the [transistor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor "Transistor") in 1947, which significantly compacted computers and led the digital transition. Information technology, particularly [optical fiber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_fiber "Optical fiber") and [optical amplifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_amplifier "Optical amplifier"), allowed for simple and fast long-distance communication, which ushered in the [Information Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Age "Information Age") and the birth of the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet "Internet"). The [Space Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Age "Space Age") began with the launch of [Sputnik 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik_1 "Sputnik 1") in 1957, and later the launch of [crewed missions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight "Human spaceflight") to the moon in the 1960s. Organized efforts to [search for extraterrestrial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_for_extraterrestrial_intelligence "Search for extraterrestrial intelligence") have used [radio telescopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_telescope "Radio telescope") to detect signs of technology use, or _[technosignatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technosignature "Technosignature")_, given off by alien civilizations. In medicine, new technologies were developed for diagnosis ([CT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CT_scan "CT scan"), [PET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission_tomography "Positron emission tomography"), and [MRI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRI "MRI") scanning), treatment (like the [dialysis machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialysis_machine "Dialysis machine"), [defibrillator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defibrillator "Defibrillator"), [pacemaker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacemaker "Pacemaker"), and a wide array of new [pharmaceutical drugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug "Pharmaceutical drug")), and research (like [interferon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon "Interferon") cloning and [DNA microarrays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_microarray "DNA microarray")).[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-63)

Complex manufacturing and construction techniques and organizations are needed to make and maintain more modern technologies, and entire [industries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry_(economics) "Industry (economics)") have arisen to develop succeeding generations of increasingly more complex tools. Modern technology increasingly relies on training and education– their designers, builders, maintainers, and users often require sophisticated general and specific training.[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-64) Moreover, these technologies have become so complex that entire fields have developed to support them, including engineering, medicine, and [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science"); and other fields have become more complex, such as construction, transportation, and architecture.

Impact
------

Technological change is the largest cause of long-term economic growth.[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-65)[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-66) Throughout human history, energy production was the main constraint on [economic development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_development "Economic development"), and new technologies allowed humans to significantly increase the amount of available energy**.** First came fire, which made edible a wider variety of foods, and made it less physically demanding to digest them. Fire also enabled [smelting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smelting "Smelting"), and the use of [tin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin "Tin"), copper, and iron tools, used for hunting or [tradesmanship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tradesman "Tradesman"). Then came the agricultural revolution: humans no longer needed to [hunt or gather](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter-gatherer "Hunter-gatherer") to survive, and began to settle in towns and cities, forming more complex societies, with [militaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militaries "Militaries") and more organized forms of religion.[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-:10-67)

Technologies have contributed to human welfare through increased prosperity, improved comfort and quality of life, and [medical progress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_technology "Health technology"), but they can also disrupt existing social hierarchies, cause pollution, and harm individuals or groups.

Recent years have brought about a rise in social media's cultural prominence, with potential repercussions on democracy, and economic and social life. Early on, the internet was seen as a "liberation technology" that would democratize knowledge, improve access to education, and promote democracy. Modern research has turned to investigate the internet's downsides, including disinformation, polarization, hate speech, and propaganda.[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-68)

Since the 1970s, technology's impact on the environment has been [criticized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_technology "Criticism of technology"), leading to a surge in investment in [solar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_power "Solar power"), [wind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power "Wind power"), and other forms of [clean energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_energy "Clean energy").

#### Jobs

Since the invention of the wheel, technologies have helped increase humans' economic output. Past automation has both substituted and complemented labor; machines replaced humans at some lower-paying jobs (for example in agriculture), but this was compensated by the creation of new, higher-paying jobs.[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-69) Studies have found that computers did not create significant net [technological unemployment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_unemployment "Technological unemployment").[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-70) Due to [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence "Artificial intelligence") being far more capable than computers, and still being in its infancy, it is not known whether it will follow the same trend; the question has been debated at length among economists and policymakers. A 2017 survey found no clear consensus among economists on whether AI would increase long-term unemployment.[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-71) According to the [World Economic Forum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Economic_Forum "World Economic Forum")'s "The Future of Jobs Report 2020", AI is predicted to replace 85 million jobs worldwide, and create 97 million new jobs by 2025.[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-72)[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-73) From 1990 to 2007, a study in the U.S. by [MIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT "MIT") economist [Daron Acemoglu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daron_Acemoglu "Daron Acemoglu") showed that an addition of one robot for every 1,000 workers decreased the [employment-to-population ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment-to-population_ratio "Employment-to-population ratio") by 0.2%, or about 3.3 workers, and lowered wages by 0.42%.[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-74)[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-75) Concerns about technology replacing human labor however are long-lasting. As US president [Lyndon Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_Johnson "Lyndon Johnson") said in 1964, "Technology is creating both new opportunities and new obligations for us, opportunity for greater productivity and progress; obligation to be sure that no workingman, no family must pay an unjust price for progress." upon signing the National Commission on Technology, Automation, and Economic Progress bill.[[76]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-76)[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-77)[[78]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-78)[[79]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-79)[[80]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-80)

#### Security

With the growing reliance of technology, there have been security and privacy concerns along with it. Billions of people use different online payment methods, such as [WeChat Pay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WeChat_Pay "WeChat Pay"), [PayPal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal "PayPal"), [Alipay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alipay "Alipay"), and much more to help transfer money. Although security measures are placed, some criminals are able to bypass them.[[81]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-:11-81) In March 2022, North Korea used [Blender.io](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blender.io "Blender.io"), a [mixer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency_tumbler "Cryptocurrency tumbler") which helped them to hide their cryptocurrency exchanges, to launder over $20.5 million in cryptocurrency, from [Axie Infinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axie_Infinity "Axie Infinity"), and steal over $600 million worth of cryptocurrency from the game's owner. Because of this, the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned Blender.io, which marked the first time it has taken action against a mixer, to try to crack down on North Korean hackers.[[82]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-82)[[83]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-83) The privacy of cryptocurrency has been debated. Although many customers like the privacy of cryptocurrency, many also argue that it needs more transparency and stability.[[81]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-:11-81)

### Environmental

Technology can have both positive and negative effects on the environment. [Environmental technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_technology "Environmental technology"), describes an array of technologies which seek to reverse, mitigate or halt environmental damage to the environment. This can include measures to [halt pollution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution_prevention_program "Pollution prevention program") through environmental regulations, capture and storage of pollution, or using pollutant byproducts in other industries.[[84]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-84) Other examples of environmental technology include [deforestation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation "Deforestation") and the reversing of deforestation.[[85]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-85) Emerging technologies in the fields of [climate engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_engineering "Climate engineering") may be able to halt or reverse global warming and its environmental impacts,[[86]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-86) although this remains highly controversial.[[87]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-87) As technology has advanced, so too has the negative environmental impact, with increased release of [greenhouse gases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas "Greenhouse gas"), including [methane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane "Methane"), [nitrous oxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrous_oxide "Nitrous oxide") and [carbon dioxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide "Carbon dioxide"), into the atmosphere, causing the [greenhouse effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_effect "Greenhouse effect"). This continues to gradually heat the earth, causing global warming and [climate change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change "Climate change"). Measures of technological innovation correlates with a rise in greenhouse gas emissions.[[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-88)

#### Pollution

Pollution, the presence of contaminants in an environment that causes adverse effects, could have been present as early as the [Inca Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inca_Empire "Inca Empire"). They used a [lead sulfide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_sulfide "Lead sulfide")[flux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flux_(metallurgy) "Flux (metallurgy)") in the [smelting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smelting "Smelting") of ores, along with the use of a wind-drafted clay [kiln](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiln "Kiln"), which released lead into the [atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere "Atmosphere") and the [sediment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sediment "Sediment") of rivers.[[89]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-89)

Philosophy
----------

Philosophy of technology is a branch of philosophy that studies the "practice of designing and creating artifacts", and the "nature of the things so created."[[90]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-:5-90) It emerged as a discipline over the past two centuries, and has grown "considerably" since the 1970s.[[91]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-:8-91) The _humanities philosophy of technology_ is concerned with the "meaning of technology for, and its impact on, society and culture".[[90]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-:5-90)

Initially, technology was seen as an extension of the human organism that replicated or amplified bodily and mental faculties.[[92]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-92)[Marx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marx "Marx") framed it as a tool used by capitalists to oppress the proletariat, but believed that technology would be a fundamentally liberating force once it was "freed from societal deformations". Second-wave philosophers like Ortega later shifted their focus from economics and politics to "daily life and living in a techno-material culture", arguing that technology could oppress "even the members of the bourgeoisie who were its ostensible masters and possessors." Third-stage philosophers like [Don Ihde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Ihde "Don Ihde") and [Albert Borgmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Borgmann "Albert Borgmann") represent a turn toward de-generalization and empiricism, and considered how humans can learn to live with technology.[[91]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-:8-91)[_[page needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing\_sources "Wikipedia:Citing sources")_]

Early scholarship on technology was split between two arguments: [technological determinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_determinism "Technological determinism"), and [social construction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_construction_of_technology "Social construction of technology"). Technological determinism is the idea that technologies cause unavoidable social changes.[[93]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-:9-93): 95  It usually encompasses a related argument, technological autonomy, which asserts that technological progress follows a natural progression and cannot be prevented.[[94]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-94) Social constructivists[_[who?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual\_of\_Style/Words\_to\_watch#Unsupported\_attributions "Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch")_] argue that technologies follow no natural progression, and are shaped by cultural values, laws, politics, and economic incentives. Modern scholarship has shifted towards an analysis of [sociotechnical systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociotechnical_system "Sociotechnical system"), "assemblages of things, people, practices, and meanings", looking at the value judgments that shape technology.[[93]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-:9-93)[_[page needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing\_sources "Wikipedia:Citing sources")_]

Cultural critic [Neil Postman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Postman "Neil Postman") distinguished tool-using societies from technological societies and from what he called "technopolies", societies that are dominated by an ideology of technological and scientific progress to the detriment of other cultural practices, values, and world views.[[95]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-95)[Herbert Marcuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Marcuse "Herbert Marcuse") and [John Zerzan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Zerzan "John Zerzan") suggest that technological society will inevitably deprive us of our freedom and psychological health.[[96]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-96)

Ethics
------

The _ethics of technology_ is an interdisciplinary subfield of ethics that analyzes technology's ethical implications and explores ways to mitigate potential negative impacts of new technologies. There is a broad range of ethical issues revolving around technology, from specific areas of focus affecting professionals working with technology to broader social, ethical, and legal issues concerning the role of technology in society and everyday life.[[97]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-97)

Prominent debates have surrounded [genetically modified organisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetically_modified_organism "Genetically modified organism"), the use of robotic soldiers, [algorithmic bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_bias "Algorithmic bias"), and the issue of [aligning AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_alignment "AI alignment") behavior with human values.[[98]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-Al-Rodhan-98)

Technology ethics encompasses several key fields: [Bioethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioethics "Bioethics") looks at ethical issues surrounding biotechnologies and modern medicine, including cloning, human genetic engineering, and stem cell research. [Computer ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_ethics "Computer ethics") focuses on issues related to computing. [Cyberethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberethics "Cyberethics") explores internet-related issues like [intellectual property rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property "Intellectual property"), [privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_privacy "Internet privacy"), and [censorship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_censorship "Internet censorship"). [Nanoethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanoethics "Nanoethics") examines issues surrounding the alteration of matter at the atomic and molecular level in various disciplines including computer science, engineering, and biology. And [engineering ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_ethics "Engineering ethics") deals with the professional standards of engineers, including [software engineers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineers "Software engineers") and their moral responsibilities to the public.[[99]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-Luppicini,_R._20082-99)

A wide branch of technology ethics is concerned with the [ethics of artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence "Ethics of artificial intelligence"): it includes [robot ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot_ethics "Robot ethics"), which deals with ethical issues involved in the design, construction, use, and treatment of robots,[[100]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-Veruggio2002-100) as well as [machine ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_ethics "Machine ethics"), which is concerned with ensuring the ethical behavior of [artificially intelligent agents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_agent "Intelligent agent").[[101]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-Anderson2011-101) Within the field of AI ethics, significant yet-unsolved research problems include [AI alignment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_alignment "AI alignment") (ensuring that AI behaviors are aligned with their creators' intended goals and interests) and the reduction of [algorithmic bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_bias "Algorithmic bias"). Some researchers have warned against the hypothetical risk of an [AI takeover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_takeover "AI takeover"), and have advocated for the use of [AI capability control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_capability_control "AI capability control") in addition to AI alignment methods.

Other fields of ethics have had to contend with technology-related issues, including [military ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_ethics "Military ethics"), [media ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_ethics "Media ethics"), and [educational ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_education "Philosophy of education").

Futures studies
---------------

_Futures studies_ is the study of social and technological progress. It aims to explore the range of plausible futures and incorporate human values in the development of new technologies.[[102]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-:1-102): 54  More generally, futures researchers are interested in improving "the freedom and welfare of humankind".[[102]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-:1-102): 73  It relies on a thorough quantitative and qualitative analysis of past and present technological trends, and attempts to rigorously extrapolate them into the future.[[102]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-:1-102) Science fiction is often used as a source of ideas.[[102]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-:1-102): 173  Futures research methodologies include [survey research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survey_research "Survey research"), modeling, [statistical analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_analysis "Statistical analysis"), and [computer simulations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation "Simulation").[[102]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-:1-102): 187

### Existential risk

Existential risk researchers analyze risks that could lead to [human extinction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_extinction "Human extinction") or civilizational collapse, and look for ways to build resilience against them.[[103]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-103)[[104]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-:0-104) Relevant research centers include the [Cambridge Center for the Study of Existential Risk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_for_the_Study_of_Existential_Risk "Centre for the Study of Existential Risk"), and the Stanford Existential Risk Initiative.[[105]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-105) Future technologies may contribute to the risks of [artificial general intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence "Artificial general intelligence"), [biological warfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_warfare "Biological warfare"), [nuclear warfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_warfare "Nuclear warfare"), [nanotechnology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanotechnology "Nanotechnology"), [anthropogenic climate change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropogenic_climate_change "Anthropogenic climate change"), [global warming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming "Global warming"), or stable global [totalitarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totalitarianism "Totalitarianism"), though technologies may also help us mitigate [asteroid impacts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_event "Impact event") and [gamma-ray bursts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma-ray_burst "Gamma-ray burst").[[106]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-106) In 2019 philosopher [Nick Bostrom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Bostrom "Nick Bostrom") introduced the notion of a _vulnerable world_, "one in which there is some level of technological development at which civilization almost certainly gets devastated by default", citing the risks of a [pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic "Pandemic") caused by [bioterrorists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioterrorism "Bioterrorism"), or an [arms race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms_race "Arms race") triggered by the development of novel armaments and the loss of [mutual assured destruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction "Mutual assured destruction").[[107]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-Bostrom_2019-107) He invites policymakers to question the assumptions that technological progress is always beneficial, that scientific openness is always preferable, or that they can afford to wait until a dangerous technology has been invented before they prepare mitigations.[[107]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-Bostrom_2019-107)

Emerging technologies
---------------------

[![Image 8: Photo of a scientist looking at a microscope pointed at a petri dish](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/Army_invests_in_3-D_bioprinting_to_treat_injured_Soldiers.jpg/250px-Army_invests_in_3-D_bioprinting_to_treat_injured_Soldiers.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Army_invests_in_3-D_bioprinting_to_treat_injured_Soldiers.jpg)

Experimental 3D printing of muscle tissue

Emerging technologies are novel technologies whose development or practical applications are still largely unrealized. They include [nanotechnology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanotechnology "Nanotechnology"), [biotechnology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biotechnology "Biotechnology"), [robotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics "Robotics"), [3D printing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_printing "3D printing"), and [blockchains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain "Blockchain").

In 2005, futurist [Ray Kurzweil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Kurzweil "Ray Kurzweil") claimed the next technological revolution would rest upon advances in [genetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics "Genetics"), [nanotechnology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanotechnology "Nanotechnology"), and [robotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics "Robotics"), with robotics being the most impactful of the three technologies.[[108]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-108)[Genetic engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering "Genetic engineering") will allow far greater control over human biological nature through a process called [directed evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_evolution_(transhumanism) "Directed evolution (transhumanism)"). Some thinkers believe that this may shatter our sense of self, and have urged for renewed public debate exploring the issue more thoroughly;[[109]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-109) others fear that directed evolution could lead to eugenics or extreme social inequality. [Nanotechnology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanotechnology "Nanotechnology") will grant us the ability to manipulate matter "at the molecular and atomic scale",[[110]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-110) which could allow us to reshape ourselves and our environment in fundamental ways.[[111]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-111) Nanobots could be used within the human body to destroy cancer cells or form new body parts, blurring the line between biology and technology.[[112]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-112)[Autonomous robots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_robot "Autonomous robot") have undergone rapid progress, and are expected to replace humans at many dangerous tasks, including [search and rescue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_and_rescue "Search and rescue"), [bomb disposal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomb_disposal "Bomb disposal"), [firefighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefighting "Firefighting"), and war.[[113]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-113)

Estimates on the advent of [artificial general intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence "Artificial general intelligence") vary, but half of machine learning experts surveyed in 2018 believe that AI will "accomplish every task better and more cheaply" than humans by 2063, and automate all human jobs by 2140.[[114]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-114) This expected technological unemployment has led to calls for increased emphasis on [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science") education and debates about [universal basic income](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_basic_income "Universal basic income"). Political science experts predict that this could lead to a rise in extremism, while others see it as an opportunity to usher in a [post-scarcity economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-scarcity_economy "Post-scarcity economy").

Some segments of the [1960s hippie counterculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterculture_of_the_1960s "Counterculture of the 1960s") grew to dislike urban living and developed a preference for [locally autonomous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Localism_(politics) "Localism (politics)"), [sustainable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable "Sustainable"), and [decentralized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized "Decentralized") technology, termed _appropriate technology_. This later influenced [hacker culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_culture "Hacker culture") and [technopaganism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technopaganism "Technopaganism").

### Technological utopianism

Technological utopianism refers to the belief that technological development is a [moral good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_good "Moral good"), which can and should bring about a [utopia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia "Utopia"), that is, a society in which laws, governments, and social conditions serve the needs of all its citizens.[[115]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-115) Examples of techno-utopian goals include [post-scarcity economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-scarcity_economics "Post-scarcity economics"), [life extension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_extension "Life extension"), [mind uploading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_uploading "Mind uploading"), [cryonics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryonics "Cryonics"), and the creation of artificial [superintelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence "Superintelligence"). Major techno-utopian movements include [transhumanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhumanism "Transhumanism") and [singularitarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singularitarianism "Singularitarianism").

The transhumanism movement is founded upon the "continued evolution of human life beyond its current human form" through science and technology, informed by "life-promoting principles and values."[[116]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-116) The movement gained wider popularity in the early 21st century.[[117]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-117)

[Singularitarians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity "Technological singularity") believe that machine superintelligence will "accelerate technological progress" by orders of magnitude and "create even more intelligent entities ever faster", which may lead to a pace of societal and technological change that is "incomprehensible" to us. This _event horizon_ is known as the [technological singularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity "Technological singularity").[[118]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-118)

Major figures of techno-utopianism include [Ray Kurzweil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Kurzweil "Ray Kurzweil") and [Nick Bostrom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Bostrom "Nick Bostrom"). Techno-utopianism has attracted both praise and criticism from progressive, religious, and conservative thinkers.[[119]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-119)

### Anti-technology backlash

Technology's central role in our lives has drawn concerns and backlash. The backlash against technology is not a uniform movement and encompasses many heterogeneous ideologies.[[120]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-120)

The earliest known revolt against technology was [Luddism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddism "Luddism"), a pushback against early automation in textile production. Automation had resulted in a need for fewer workers, a process known as [technological unemployment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_unemployment "Technological unemployment").

Between the 1970s and 1990s, American terrorist [Ted Kaczynski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Kaczynski "Ted Kaczynski") carried out a series of bombings across America and published the _[Unabomber Manifesto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial\_Society\_and\_Its\_Future "Industrial Society and Its Future")_ denouncing technology's negative impacts on nature and human freedom. The essay resonated with a large part of the American public.[[121]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-121) It was partly inspired by Jacques Ellul's _[The Technological Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Technological\_Society "The Technological Society")_.[[122]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-122)

Some subcultures, like the [off-the-grid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-the-grid "Off-the-grid") movement, advocate a withdrawal from technology and a return to nature. The [ecovillage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecovillage "Ecovillage") movement seeks to reestablish harmony between technology and nature.[[123]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-123)

Relation to science and engineering
-----------------------------------

[![Image 9: Drawing of Lavoisier conducting an experiment in front of onlookers](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Zoom_lunette_ardente.jpg/250px-Zoom_lunette_ardente.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Zoom_lunette_ardente.jpg)

[Antoine Lavoisier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_Lavoisier "Antoine Lavoisier") experimenting with combustion generated by amplified sunlight

Engineering is the process by which technology is developed. It often requires problem-solving under strict constraints.[[124]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-:7-124) Technological development is "action-oriented", while scientific knowledge is fundamentally explanatory.[[125]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-125) Polish philosopher [Henryk Skolimowski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henryk_Skolimowski "Henryk Skolimowski") framed it like so: "science concerns itself with what _is_, technology with what _is to be_."[[126]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-126): 375

The direction of [causality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality "Causality") between scientific discovery and technological innovation has been debated by scientists, philosophers and policymakers.[[127]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-127) Because innovation is often undertaken at the edge of scientific knowledge, most technologies are not derived from scientific knowledge, but instead from engineering, tinkering and chance.[[128]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-:6-128): 217–240  For example, in the 1940s and 1950s, when knowledge of turbulent combustion or fluid dynamics was still crude, jet engines were invented through "running the device to destruction, analyzing what broke [...] and repeating the process".[[124]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-:7-124) Scientific explanations often follow technological developments rather than preceding them.[[128]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-:6-128): 217–240  Many discoveries also arose from pure chance, like the discovery of [penicillin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penicillin "Penicillin") as a result of accidental lab contamination.[[129]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-129) Since the 1960s, the assumption that government funding of [basic research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_research "Basic research") would lead to the discovery of marketable technologies has lost credibility.[[130]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-130)[[131]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-131) Probabilist Nassim Taleb argues that national research programs that implement the notions of [serendipity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serendipity "Serendipity") and [convexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convexity_(finance) "Convexity (finance)") through frequent trial and error are more likely to lead to useful innovations than research that aims to reach specific outcomes.[[128]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-:6-128)[[132]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-132)

Despite this, modern technology is increasingly reliant on deep, domain-specific scientific knowledge. In 1975, there was an average of one citation of scientific literature in every three patents granted in the U.S.; by 1989, this increased to an average of one citation per patent. The average was skewed upwards by patents related to the pharmaceutical industry, chemistry, and electronics.[[133]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-133) A 2021 analysis shows that patents that are based on scientific discoveries are on average 26% more valuable than equivalent non-science-based patents.[[134]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-134)

Other animal species
--------------------

[![Image 10: Photo of a gorilla walking hip-deep in a pond, holding a stick](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/Gorilla_tool_use_cropped.jpg/250px-Gorilla_tool_use_cropped.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Gorilla_tool_use_cropped.jpg)

This adult gorilla uses a branch as a [walking stick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking_stick "Walking stick") to gauge the water's depth.

The use of basic technology is also a feature of non-human animal species. Tool use was once considered a defining characteristic of the genus [Homo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo "Homo").[[135]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-135) This view was supplanted after discovering evidence of tool use among [chimpanzees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimpanzee "Chimpanzee") and other primates,[[136]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-136) dolphins,[[137]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-20050607bbc-137) and [crows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crow "Crow").[[138]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-nbcnews21135366-138)[[139]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-139) For example, researchers have observed wild chimpanzees using basic foraging tools, pestles, levers, using leaves as sponges, and tree bark or vines as probes to fish termites.[[140]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-140)[West African chimpanzees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_African_chimpanzee "West African chimpanzee") use stone hammers and anvils for cracking nuts,[[141]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-141) as do [capuchin monkeys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capuchin_monkey "Capuchin monkey") of [Boa Vista](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boa_Vista,_Roraima "Boa Vista, Roraima"), Brazil.[[142]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-20090115newscientist-142) Tool use is not the only form of animal technology use; for example, [beaver dams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaver_dam "Beaver dam"), built with wooden sticks or large stones, are a technology with "dramatic" impacts on river habitats and ecosystems.[[143]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-143)

In popular culture
------------------

The relationship of humanity with technology has been explored in science-fiction literature, for example in _[Brave New World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brave\_New\_World "Brave New World")_, _[A Clockwork Orange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A\_Clockwork\_Orange\_(novel) "A Clockwork Orange (novel)")_, _[Nineteen Eighty-Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen\_Eighty-Four "Nineteen Eighty-Four")_, [Isaac Asimov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov "Isaac Asimov")'s essays, and movies like _[Minority Report](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority\_Report\_(film) "Minority Report (film)")_, _[Total Recall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total\_Recall\_(1990\_film) "Total Recall (1990 film)")_, _[Gattaca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gattaca "Gattaca")_, and _[Inception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inception "Inception")_. It has spawned the dystopian and futuristic [cyberpunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk "Cyberpunk") genre, which juxtaposes futuristic technology with societal collapse, dystopia or decay.[[144]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology#cite_note-144) Notable cyberpunk works include [William Gibson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Gibson "William Gibson")'s _[Neuromancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromancer "Neuromancer")_ novel, and movies like _[Blade Runner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade\_Runner "Blade Runner")_, and _[The Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Matrix "The Matrix")_.

"Is life likely to exist elsewhere in the [Milky Way] galaxy? Almost certainly yes, given the speed with which it appeared on Earth. Is another technological civilization likely to exist today? Almost certainly no, given the chain of circumstances that led to our existence. These considerations suggest that we are unique not just on our planet but in the whole Milky Way. And if our planet is so special, it becomes all the more important to preserve this unique world for ourselves, our descendants and the many creatures that call Earth home." (p.99.)
