In an attempt to understand the origin of atoms , Georges Lemaître proposed (by 1927) that before the expansion of the universe started all the matter in the universe , it formed a gigantic ball of nuclear liquid at very low temperature . This low temperature was required to provide an adequate cohesion within the Lemaître 's primeval atom.   In 1966, David Layzer proposed a variant on Lemaître's cosmology in which the initial state of the universe was near absolute zero .  Layzer argued that, rather than in an initial high entropy state, the primordial universe was in a very low entropy state near absolute zero.

The mainstream version of the Cold Big Bang model predicted an absence of acoustic peaks in the cosmic microwave background radiation [ 1 ] and was eventually explicitly ruled out by WMAP observations.
