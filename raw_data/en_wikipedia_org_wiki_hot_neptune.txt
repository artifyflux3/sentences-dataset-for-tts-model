[ 1 ] The first hot Neptune to be discovered with certainty was Gliese 436 b (Awohali) in 2007, an exoplanet about 33 light years away. Recent observations have revealed a larger potential population of hot Neptunes in the Milky Way than was previously thought.

[ 2 ] Hot Neptunes may have formed either in situ or ex situ .

[ 3 ] General characteristics [ edit ] Because of their close proximity to their parent stars , hot Neptunes have a much greater rate and chance of transiting their star as seen from a farther outlying point, than planets of the same mass in larger orbits. This increases the chances of discovering them by transit-based observation methods .

Transiting hot Neptunes include Gliese 436 b (Awohali) and HAT-P-11b . Gliese 436 b was the first hot Neptune to be discovered with certainty in 2007. The exoplanet Mu Arae c (Dulcinea) discovered in 2004 might also be a hot Neptune, but it has not been determined definitively. Another may be Kepler-56b , which has a mass somewhat larger than Neptune's and orbits its star at 0.1 AU, closer than Mercury orbits the Sun.

[ 4 ] The first theoretical study of how hot Neptunes could form was carried out in 2004.

[ 5 ] If these planets formed ex situ, i.e., by migrating to their current locations while growing, they may contain large quantities of frozen volatiles and amorphous ices . Otherwise, if they formed in situ, their inventory of heavy elements should be made entirely of refractory materials .

[ 3 ] Yet, regardless of the mode of formation, hot Neptunes should contain large fractions (by mass) of gases, primarily hydrogen and helium, which also account for most of their volume.

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] Ultra-hot Neptune [ edit ] LTT 9779 b (Cuancoá) is the first ultra-hot Neptune discovered with an orbital period of 19 hours and an atmospheric temperature of over 1700 degrees Celsius. Being so close to its star and with a mass around twice that of Neptune, its atmosphere should have evaporated into space so its existence requires an unusual explanation.

[ 8 ] A candidate planet around Vega slightly more massive than Neptune was detected in 2021. It orbits Vega, an A-class star, every 2.43 days, and with a temperature of about 2500 degrees Celsius would be the second-hottest planet on record if confirmed.
