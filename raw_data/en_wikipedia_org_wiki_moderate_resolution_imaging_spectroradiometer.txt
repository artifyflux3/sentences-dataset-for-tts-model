This detailed, photo-like view of Earth is based largely on observations from MODIS.

The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS ) is a satellite-based sensor used for earth and climate measurements. There are two MODIS sensors in Earth orbit : one on board the Terra ( EOS AM) satellite, launched by NASA in 1999; and one on board the Aqua (EOS PM) satellite, launched in 2002. Since 2011, MODIS operations have been supplemented by VIIRS sensors, such as the one aboard Suomi NPP . The systems often conduct similar operations due to their similar designs and orbits (with VIIRS data systems deisgned to be compatible with MODIS), though they have subtle differences contributing to similar but not identical uses.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] The MODIS instruments were built by Santa Barbara Remote Sensing.

[ 3 ] They capture data in 36 spectral bands ranging in wavelength from 0.4 μm to 14.4 μm and at varying spatial resolutions (2 bands at 250 m, 5 bands at 500 m and 29 bands at 1 km). Together the instruments image the entire Earth every 1 to 2 days. They are designed to provide measurements in large-scale global dynamics including changes in Earth's cloud cover , radiation budget and processes occurring in the oceans, on land, and in the lower atmosphere .

Support and calibration is provided by the MODIS characterization support team (MCST).

[ 4 ] Applications [ edit ] This section needs expansion . You can help by adding to it .

( September 2014 ) With its high temporal resolution although low spatial resolution, MODIS data are useful to track changes in the landscape over time. Examples of such applications are the monitoring of vegetation health by means of time-series analyses with vegetation indices, [ 5 ] long term land cover changes (e.g. to monitor deforestation rates), [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] global snow cover trends, [ 10 ] [ 11 ] water inundation from pluvial, riverine, or sea level rise flooding in coastal areas, [ 12 ] change of water levels of major lakes such as the Aral Sea , [ 13 ] [ 14 ] and the detection and mapping of wildland fires in the United States.

[ 15 ] The United States Forest Service 's Remote Sensing Applications Center analyzes MODIS imagery on a continuous basis to provide information for the management and suppression of wildfires.

[ 18 ] MODIS has used the marine optical buoy for vicarious calibration.
