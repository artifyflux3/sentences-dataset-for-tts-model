Liberalism as a specifically named ideology begins in the late 18th century as a movement towards self-government and away from aristocracy . It included the ideas of self-determination , the primacy of the individual and the nation as opposed to the state and religion as being the fundamental units of law, politics and economy.

Since then liberalism broadened to include a wide range of approaches from Americans Ronald Dworkin , Richard Rorty , John Rawls and Francis Fukuyama as well as the Indian Amartya Sen and the Peruvian Hernando de Soto . Some of these people moved away from liberalism while others espoused other ideologies before turning to liberalism. There are many different views of what constitutes liberalism, and some liberals would feel that some of the people on this list were not true liberals. It is intended to be suggestive rather than exhaustive. Theorists whose ideas were mainly typical for one country should be listed in that country's section of liberalism worldwide . Generally only thinkers are listed whereas politicians are only listed when they also made substantial contributions to liberal theory beside their active political work.

Find sources: "List of liberal theorists" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( June 2012 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Aristotle Aristotle (Athens, 384–322 BC) is revered among political theorists for his seminal work Politics . He made invaluable contributions to liberal theory through his observations on different forms of government and the nature of man.

He begins with the idea that the best government provides an active and " happy " life for its people. Aristotle then considers six forms of government: Monarchy , Aristocracy , and Polity on one side as 'good' forms of government, and Tyranny , Oligarchy , and Democracy as 'bad' forms. Considering each in turn, Aristotle rejects Monarchy as infantilizing of citizens, Oligarchy as too profit-motivated, Tyranny as against the will of the people, Democracy as serving only to the poor, and Aristocracy (known today as Meritocracy ) as ideal but ultimately impossible. Aristotle finally concludes that a polity—a combination between democracy and oligarchy, where most can vote but must choose among the rich and virtuous for governors—is the best compromise between idealism and realism .

In addition, Aristotle was a firm supporter of private property . He refuted Plato's argument for a collectivist society in which family and property are held in common: Aristotle makes the argument that when one's own son or land is rightfully one's own, one puts much more effort into cultivating that item, to the ultimate betterment of society. He references barbarian tribes of his time in which property was held in common, and the laziest of the bunch would always take away large amounts of food grown by the most diligent.

Cicero [ edit ] His Stoic, Cato, advocated for Greek Stoicism in Cicero's books. It's a development of Aristotle's ethics and goes further, advocating equal rights for all people. It was found to be scientifically true on inspection in the '90s, by Becker (1998).

[ 1 ] He was also a major influence to John Locke.

Laozi [ edit ] Further information: Laozi § Influence Laozi was a Chinese philosopher and writer, considered the founder of Taoism . Arguing that Laozi is a libertarian , James A. Dorn wrote that Laozi, like many 18th-century liberals, "argued that minimizing the role of government and letting individuals develop spontaneously would best achieve social and economic harmony." [ 2 ] Liberal thinkers of the Muslim Golden Age [ edit ] The Islamic Golden Age (8th to 14th century) was marked by a flourishing of intellectual activity in the Islamic world. Several scholars and thinkers from this era contributed to ideas that align with certain liberal principles, emphasizing reason, justice, and individual rights.

Al-Farabi (872–950) [ edit ] Al-Farabi, known as "the Second Teacher," was a philosopher influential in transmitting Greek philosophy to the Islamic world. His political philosophy, seen in works like The Virtuous City , [ 3 ] stressed the importance of justice and the common good in governance, influencing both Muslim and European thought.

[ 4 ] Averroes (1126–1198) [ edit ] Ibn Rushd, a Spanish-Arab philosopher, advocated for the compatibility of reason and philosophy with Islamic faith. His commentaries on Aristotle and independent works promoted the separation of reason and revelation, profoundly influencing both Islamic and Western thought.

[ 5 ] Avicenna (980–1037) [ edit ] Ibn Sina, a polymath known for contributions to medicine and metaphysics, delved into political philosophy. In *The Book of Healing*, he discussed the need for a well-ordered state, emphasizing the role of a philosopher-king guided by reason and wisdom.

[ 6 ] Ibn Tufayl (1105–1185) [ edit ] Ibn Tufail, a philosopher and physician, explored individualism and reason in Hayy ibn Yaqdhan .

[ 7 ] The novel discussed a person raised in isolation, emphasizing themes of individual pursuit of knowledge.

( June 2024 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Niccolò Machiavelli Niccolò Machiavelli (Florence, 1469–1527), best known for his Il Principe was the founder of realist political philosophy, advocated republican government, citizen armies, protection of personal property, and restraint of government expenditure as being necessary to the liberties of a republic. He wrote extensively on the need for individual initiative— virtu —as an essential characteristic of stable government. He argued that liberty was the central good which government should protect, and that "good people" would make good laws, whereas people who had lost their virtue could maintain their liberties only with difficulty. His Discourses on Livy outlined realism as the central idea of political study and favored "Republics" over "Principalities".

Machiavelli differed from true liberal thinking however, in that he still noted the benefits of princely governance.

[ 8 ] He states that republican leaders need to "act alone" if they want to reform a republic, and offers the example of Romulus, who killed his brother and co-ruler to found a great city.

[ 9 ] Republics need to refer to arbitrary and violent measures if it is necessary to maintain the structure of the government, as Machiavelli says that they have to ignore thoughts of justice and fairness.

[ 10 ] Anti-statist liberals consider Machiavelli's distrust as his main message, noting his call for a strong state under a strong leader, who should use any means to establish his position, whereas liberalism is an ideology of individual freedom and voluntary choices.

( June 2024 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Thomas Hobbes Thomas Hobbes (England, 1588–1679) theorized that government is the result of individual actions and human traits, and that it was motivated primarily by "interest", a term which would become crucial in the development of a liberal theory of government and political economy, since it is the foundation of the idea that individuals can be self-governing and self-regulating. His work Leviathan , did not advocate this viewpoint, but instead that only a strong government could restrain unchecked interest: it did, however, advance a proto-liberal position in arguing for an inalienable "right of nature," the right to defend oneself, even against the state.

[ citation needed ] Though his own ideological position is open to debate, his work influenced Spinoza, Locke, Hamilton, Jefferson, Madison and many other liberals.

[ 12 ] Contributing literature: Leviathan , 1651 (Theologico-Political Treatise) Spinoza [ edit ] Portrait of Baruch Spinoza , 1665.

Baruch Spinoza (Netherlands, 1632–1677) in his Tractatus Theologico-Politicus (TTP) (1670) and Tractatus Politicus (1678) defends the importance of separation of church and state as well as forms of democracy . In the TTP , Spinoza articulates a strong critique of religious intolerance and a defense of secular government against the power of religious authorities.

[ 13 ] [ 14 ] Spinoza laid the philosophical groundwork for the emancipation of Jews, putting them on an equal footing as other citizens.

[ 15 ] Contributing literature: Tractatus Theologico-Politicus , 1670 (Theologico-Political Treatise) [ 16 ] Tractatus Politicus , 1677 (Political Treatise) From Locke to Tocqueville [ edit ] John Locke [ edit ] John Locke John Locke 's (England, 1632–1704) notion that a " government with the consent of the governed " and man's natural rights — life , liberty , and estate ( property ) as well on tolerance , as laid down in A letter concerning toleration and Two treatises of government —had an enormous influence on the development of liberalism . Locke developed a theory of property resting on the actions of individuals, rather than on descent or nobility.

Some literature: A Letter Concerning Toleration , 1689 [ 17 ] The Second Treatise of Civil Government , 1689 [ 18 ] John Trenchard [ edit ] John Trenchard (United Kingdom, 1662–1723) was co-author, with Thomas Gordon of Cato's Letters . These newspaper essays condemned tyranny and advanced principles of freedom of conscience and freedom of speech and were a main vehicle for spreading the concepts that had been developed by John Locke .

Some literature: Cato's Letters / John Trenchard & Thomas Gordon, 1720–1723 Charles de Montesquieu [ edit ] Montesquieu Charles de Montesquieu (France, 1689–1755)
In The Spirit of Law , Montesquieu expounded the separation of powers in government and society. In government, Montesquieu encouraged division into the now standard legislative, judicial and executive branches; in society, he perceived a natural organization into king, the people and the aristocracy, with the latter playing a mediating role. "I do not write to censor that which is established in any country whatsoever," Montesquieu disclaimed in the Laws ; however, he did pay special attention to what he felt was the positive example of the constitutional system in England, which in spite of its evolution toward a fusion of powers, had moderated the power of the monarch, and divided Parliament along class lines.

Montesquieu's work had a seminal impact on the American and French revolutionaries. Ironically, the least liberal element of his thought—his privileging of the aristocracy—was belied by both revolutions. Montesquieu's system came to fruition in America, a country with no aristocracy; in France, political maneuvering by the aristocracy led to the convocation of the 1789 Estates-General and popular revolt.

In his Wealth of Nations Adam Smith outlined the key idea that if the economy is basically left to its own devices, limited and finite resources will be put to ultimately their most efficient use through people acting purely in their self-interest. This concept has been quoted out of context by later economists as the invisible hand of the market.

Smith also advanced property rights and personal civil liberties , including stopping slavery, which today partly form the basic liberal ideology. He was also opposed to stock-holding companies, what today is called a "corporation", because he predicated the self-policing of the free market upon the free association of moral individuals.

Some consider Mill as the founder of Social liberalism . Although Mill was mainly for free markets , he accepted interventions in the economy, such as a tax on alcohol, if there were sufficient utilitarian grounds. Mill was also a champion of women's rights.

For Spencer, voluntary cooperation was the hallmark of the most vibrant form of society, accommodating the widest diversity of members and the greatest diversity of goals. Spencer's evolutionary approach has been characterized as an extension of Adam Smith 's "invisible hand" explanation of economic order; his extensive work on sympathy (in psychology as well as the foundation of ethics, particularly in The Data of Ethics ) explicitly carried on Smith's approach in The Theory of Moral Sentiments . Spencer is frequently characterized as a leading Social Darwinist .

Şinasi used his newspapers, Tercüman-ı Ahvâl and Tasvîr-i Efkâr , to promote the proliferation of European Enlightenment ideals during the Tanzimat period , [ 40 ] and he made the education of the literate Ottoman public his personal vocation. Though many of Şinasi's projects were incomplete at the time of his death, "he was at the forefront of a number of fields and put his stamp on the development of each field so long as it contained unsolved problems." Şinasi, influenced by Enlightenment thought, saw freedom of expression as a fundamental right and used journalism in order to engage, communicate with, and educate the public. By speaking directly to the public about government affairs, Şinasi declared that state actions were not solely the interest of the government.

These, Berlin felt, tended towards totalitarianism. Negative conceptions, by contrast, argued that liberty was achieved when individuals were given maximal freedom from external constraints (so long as these did not infringe on the freedom of others to achieve the same condition). Berlin was also a critic of dogmatic Enlightenment rationalism on the grounds that it was unable to accommodate value pluralism.

[ 55 ] He has regularly argued for the importance of political philosophy and that members of the Liberal Democrats require more conviction in their beliefs.
