It was founded December 11, 2000, by the French CNRS and Italian INFN , and is headquartered near Pisa , in the commune of Cascina .

[ 1 ] Overview [ edit ] EGO is established under Italian law.

[ 2 ] Its governing body is a council composed of appointees nominated by the consortium members (up to three councilors per member).

[ 3 ] The Council appoints a Director who is the legal representative and chief executive of EGO.

[ 4 ] A scientific advisory committee advises the council on scientific and technical activities carried out by the consortium. It is composed of up to ten scientific personalities.

[ 5 ] EGO pursues these main objectives: [ 6 ] ensures the functioning of the VIRGO antenna, its maintenance, its operation and the improvements to be made; ensures the maintenance of the related infrastructures, including a computer centre and promotes an open co-operation in R&D; ensures the maintenance of the site; carries out any other research in the field of gravitation of common interest for the Members; promotes the co-operation in the field of the experimental and theoretical gravitational waves research in Europe; promotes contacts among scientists and engineers, the dissemination of information and the provision of advanced training for young researchers.

Membership [ edit ] The two founding members are the French CNRS and Italian INFN . The Dutch Nikhef joined as an observer in 2007 and a full member in early 2021.

[ 1 ] Institutions from Poland, Spain and Belgium joined EGO as observers in 2023, [ 7 ] with the Belgian FWO and FNRS joining as full members in March 2025.

[ 8 ] Budget [ edit ] EGO has an annual budget of €9 million split evenly between the French CNRS and Italian INFN. It also receives contributions in kind from the Dutch NIKHEF.
