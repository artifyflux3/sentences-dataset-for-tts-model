A **degree** (in full, a **degree of arc**, **arc degree**, or **arcdegree**), usually denoted by **°** (the [degree symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_symbol "Degree symbol")), is a measurement of a [plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(mathematics) "Plane (mathematics)")[angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle "Angle") in which one [full rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn_(geometry) "Turn (geometry)") is 360 degrees.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)#cite_note-:1-4)

It is not an [SI unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI_unit "SI unit")—the SI unit of angular measure is the [radian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radian "Radian")—but it is mentioned in the [SI brochure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI_Brochure "SI Brochure") as an [accepted unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-SI_units_mentioned_in_the_SI "Non-SI units mentioned in the SI").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)#cite_note-5) Because a full rotation equals 2 π radians, one degree is equivalent to ⁠π/180⁠ radians.

[![Image 2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/Equilateral_chord_with_length_equal_to_radius.svg/250px-Equilateral_chord_with_length_equal_to_radius.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Equilateral_chord_with_length_equal_to_radius.svg)

A circle with an equilateral [chord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_(geometry) "Chord (geometry)") (red). One sixtieth of this arc is a degree. Six such chords complete the circle.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)#cite_note-6)

The original motivation for choosing the degree as a unit of rotations and angles is unknown. One theory states that it is related to the fact that 360 is approximately the number of days in a year. Ancient [astronomers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomers "Astronomers") noticed that the sun, which follows through the [ecliptic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecliptic "Ecliptic") path over the course of the year, seems to advance in its path by approximately one degree each day. Some ancient [calendars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar "Calendar"), such as the [Persian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_calendar "Iranian calendar") and the [Babylonian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_calendar "Babylonian calendar"), used 360 days for a year. The use of a calendar with 360 days may be related to the use of [sexagesimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexagesimal "Sexagesimal") numbers.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)#cite_note-:1-4)

Another theory is that the Babylonians subdivided the circle using the angle of an [equilateral triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equilateral_triangle "Equilateral triangle") as the basic unit, and further subdivided the latter into 60 parts following their [sexagesimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexagesimal "Sexagesimal") numeric system.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)#cite_note-7)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)#cite_note-8) The [earliest trigonometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_trigonometry "History of trigonometry"), used by the [Babylonian astronomers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_astronomy "Babylonian astronomy") and their [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_astronomy "Greek astronomy") successors, was based on [chords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_(geometry) "Chord (geometry)") of a circle. A chord of length equal to the radius made a natural base quantity. One sixtieth of this, using their standard [sexagesimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexagesimal "Sexagesimal") divisions, was a degree.

[Aristarchus of Samos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristarchus_of_Samos "Aristarchus of Samos") and [Hipparchus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hipparchus "Hipparchus") seem to have been among the first [Greek scientists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_astronomy "Greek astronomy") to exploit Babylonian astronomical knowledge and techniques systematically.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)#cite_note-9)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)#cite_note-10)[Timocharis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timocharis "Timocharis"), Aristarchus, [Aristillus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristillus "Aristillus"), [Archimedes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes "Archimedes"), and Hipparchus were the first Greeks known to divide the circle in 360 degrees of 60 [arc minutes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc_minute "Arc minute").[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_][Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes "Eratosthenes") used a simpler [sexagesimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexagesimal "Sexagesimal") system dividing a circle into 60 parts.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

Another motivation for choosing the number 360 may have been that it is [readily divisible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highly_composite_number "Highly composite number"): 360 has 24 [divisors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divisor "Divisor"),[[note 1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)#cite_note-11) making it one of only 7 numbers such that no number less than twice as much has more divisors (sequence [A072938](https://oeis.org/A072938 "oeis:A072938") in the [OEIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-Line_Encyclopedia_of_Integer_Sequences "On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences")).[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)#cite_note-Brefeld-12) Furthermore, it is divisible by every number from 1 to 10 except 7.[[note 2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)#cite_note-13) This property has many useful applications, such as dividing the world into 24 [time zones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_zone "Time zone"), each of which is nominally 15° of [longitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude "Longitude"), to correlate with the established [24-hour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour "Hour")[day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day "Day") convention.

Finally, it may be the case that more than one of these factors has come into play. According to that theory, the number is approximately 365 because of the apparent movement of the sun against the celestial sphere, and that it was rounded to 360 for some of the mathematical reasons cited above.

For many practical purposes, a degree is a small enough angle that whole degrees provide sufficient precision. When this is not the case, as in [astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy "Astronomy") or for [geographic coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system "Geographic coordinate system") ([latitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude "Latitude") and [longitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude "Longitude")), degree measurements may be written using [decimal degrees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_degrees "Decimal degrees") (_DD notation_); for example, 40.1875°.

Alternatively, the traditional [sexagesimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexagesimal "Sexagesimal")[unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement "Units of measurement") subdivisions can be used: one degree is divided into 60 _minutes (of arc)_, and one minute into 60 _seconds (of arc)_. Use of degrees-minutes-seconds is also called **DMS notation**.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)#cite_note-Chang_2019-14) These subdivisions, also called the _[arcminute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcminute "Arcminute")_ and _[arcsecond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcsecond "Arcsecond")_, are represented by a [single prime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_(symbol) "Prime (symbol)") (′) and [double prime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_(symbol) "Prime (symbol)") (″) respectively. For example, 40.1875° = 40° 11′ 15″. Additional precision can be provided using decimal fractions of an arcsecond.

Maritime charts are marked in degrees and decimal minutes to facilitate measurement; 1 minute of latitude is 1 [nautical mile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nautical_mile "Nautical mile"). The example above would be given as 40° 11.25′ (commonly written as 11′25 or 11′.25).[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)#cite_note-Hopkinson_2012-15)

The older system of **thirds**, **fourths**, etc., which continues the sexagesimal unit subdivision, was used by [al-Kashi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Kashi "Al-Kashi")[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] and other ancient astronomers, but is rarely used today. These subdivisions were denoted by writing the [Roman numeral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral "Roman numeral") for the number of sixtieths in superscript: 1 I for a "[prime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_(symbol) "Prime (symbol)")" (minute of arc), 1 II for a [second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_prime "Double prime"), 1 III for a [third](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_prime "Triple prime"), 1 IV for a [fourth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadruple_prime "Quadruple prime"), etc.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)#cite_note-Al-Biruni_1000-16) Hence, the modern symbols for the minute and second of arc, and the word "second" also refer to this system.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)#cite_note-17)

[SI prefixes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI_prefixes "SI prefixes") can also be applied as in, e.g., **millidegree**, **microdegree**, etc.

[![Image 3](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Degree-Radian_Conversion.svg/330px-Degree-Radian_Conversion.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Degree-Radian_Conversion.svg)

A chart to convert between degrees and radians

In most [mathematical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics") work beyond practical geometry, angles are typically measured in [radians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radian "Radian") rather than degrees. This is for a variety of reasons; for example, the [trigonometric functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometric_function "Trigonometric function") have simpler and more "natural" properties when their arguments are expressed in radians. These considerations outweigh the convenient divisibility of the number 360. One complete [turn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn_(geometry) "Turn (geometry)") (360°) is equal to 2 _[π](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi "Pi")_ radians, so 180° is equal to π radians, or equivalently, the degree is a [mathematical constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_constant "Mathematical constant"): 1° = π⁄180.

One [turn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn_(geometry) "Turn (geometry)") (corresponding to a cycle or revolution) is equal to 360°.

With the invention of the [metric system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_system "Metric system"), based on powers of ten, there was an attempt to replace degrees by decimal "degrees" in France and nearby countries,[[note 3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)#cite_note-18) where the number in a right angle is equal to 100 gon with 400 gon in a full circle (1° = 10⁄9 gon). This was called _grade (nouveau)_ or _[grad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grad\_(angle) "Grad (angle)")_. Due to confusion with the existing term _grad(e)_ in some northern European countries (meaning a standard degree, ⁠1/360⁠ of a turn), the new unit was called _Neugrad_ in [German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language "German language") (whereas the "old" degree was referred to as _Altgrad_), likewise _nygrad_ in [Danish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danish_language "Danish language"), [Swedish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_language "Swedish language") and [Norwegian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_language "Norwegian language") (also _gradian_), and _nýgráða_ in [Icelandic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icelandic_language "Icelandic language"). To end the confusion, the name _gon_ was later adopted for the new unit. Although this idea of metrification was abandoned by Napoleon, grades continued to be used in several fields and many [scientific calculators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_calculator "Scientific calculator") support them. Decigrades (1⁄4,000) were used with French artillery sights in World War I.

An [angular mil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_mil "Angular mil"), which is most used in military applications, has at least three specific variants, ranging from 1⁄6,400 to 1⁄6,000. It is approximately equal to one [milliradian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milliradian "Milliradian") (c.1⁄6,283). A mil measuring 1⁄6,000 of a revolution originated in the [imperial Russian army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Russian_Army "Imperial Russian Army"), where an equilateral chord was divided into tenths to give a circle of 600 units. This may be seen on a lining plane (an early device for aiming [indirect fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indirect_fire "Indirect fire") artillery) dating from about 1900 in the [St. Petersburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Petersburg "St. Petersburg") Museum of Artillery.
