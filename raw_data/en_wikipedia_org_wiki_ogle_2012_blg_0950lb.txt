This type of planet was once thought to be extremely rare because of runaway gas accretion , which would create a gap between 4 and 8 Earth radii or 20 and 80 Earth masses, peaking around 32-64 Earth masses.

[ 3 ] The planet is 2.6 AU from its star.

[ 1 ] [ 4 ] It is likely near-impossible to know much else about the planet's properties (or its star's) because it was detected by gravitational microlensing .

[ 4 ] The mass of the host star is approximately 0.56 solar masses (consistent with an M0-0.5V-type star ).

[ 5 ] This exoplanet was the first to have its mass found out using only microlens parallax and lens flux.

[ 5 ] According to microlensing and Kepler data, analogues to this world should be common, showing that the Solar System is not necessarily a perfect model for planetary formation and the runaway gas accretion model may be incorrect or incomplete. This has implications for habitability because gas/ice giants like Jupiter and Neptune greatly influenced the Earth's water content (see Grand Tack hypothesis ).

[ 6 ] Composition [ edit ] Sub-Saturns have a wide range of makeups, from puffy planets to large-core worlds.

[ 7 ] With a radius of 6.5 Earth radii (predicted based on mass-radius relationships), the density would be 0.87 (39 Earth masses) or 0.7 g/cm 3 (35 Earth masses), implying a Saturn -like composition closer to a standard gas giant than an ice giant .

Tholins , a building block of life, are very common in these types of planets as well as the universe as a whole and thus may be present here.
