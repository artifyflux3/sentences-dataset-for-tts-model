It is often a type of observational study , although it can also be structured as longitudinal randomized experiment .

[ 1 ] Longitudinal studies are often used in social-personality and clinical psychology , to study rapid fluctuations in behaviors, thoughts, and emotions from moment to moment or day to day; in developmental psychology , to study developmental trends across the life span; and in sociology , to study life events throughout lifetimes or generations; and in consumer research and political polling to study consumer trends. The reason for this is that, unlike cross-sectional studies , in which different individuals with the same characteristics are compared, [ 2 ] longitudinal studies track the same people, and so the differences observed in those people are less likely to be the result of cultural differences across generations, that is, the cohort effect . Longitudinal studies thus make observing changes more accurate and are applied in various other fields. In medicine, the design is used to uncover predictors of certain diseases. In advertising, the design is used to identify the changes that advertising has produced in the attitudes and behaviors of those within the target audience who have seen the advertising campaign. Longitudinal studies allow social scientists to distinguish short from long-term phenomena, such as poverty . If the poverty rate is 10% at a point in time, this may mean that 10% of the population are always poor or that the whole population experiences poverty for 10% of the time.

Longitudinal studies can be retrospective (looking back in time, thus using existing data such as medical records or claims database) or prospective (requiring the collection of new data).

[ citation needed ] Cohort studies are one type of longitudinal study which sample a cohort (a group of people who share a defining characteristic, typically who experienced a common event in a selected period, such as birth or graduation) and perform cross-section observations at intervals through time. Not all longitudinal studies are cohort studies; some instead include a group of people who do not share a common event.

[ 3 ] As opposed to observing an entire population, a panel study follows a smaller, selected group - called a 'panel'.

[ 4 ] Advantages [ edit ] When longitudinal studies are observational , in the sense that they observe the state of the world without manipulating it, it has been argued that they may have less power to detect causal relationships than experiments . Others say that because of the repeated observation at the individual level, they have more power than cross-sectional observational studies, by virtue of being able to exclude time-invariant unobserved individual differences and also of observing the temporal order of events.

[ 5 ] [ failed verification ] Longitudinal studies do not require large numbers of participants (as in the examples below). Qualitative longitudinal studies may include only a handful of participants, [ 6 ] and longitudinal pilot or feasibility studies often have fewer than 100 participants.

[ 7 ] Disadvantages [ edit ] Longitudinal studies are time-consuming and expensive.

[ 8 ] Longitudinal studies cannot avoid an attrition effect: that is, some subjects cannot continue to participate in the study for various reasons. Under longitudinal research methods, the reduction in the research sample will bias the remaining smaller sample.

[ citation needed ] Practice effect is also one of the problems: longitudinal studies tend to be influenced because subjects repeat the same procedure many times (potentially introducing autocorrelation ), and this may cause their performance to improve or deteriorate.

[ citation needed ] Examples [ edit ] Study name Type Country or region Year started Participants Remarks 45 and Up Study Cohort Australia 2006 267,153 The 45 and Up Study is a longitudinal study of participants aged 45 years and over in New South Wales conducted by the Sax Institute . Researchers are able to analyze Study data linked to MBS and PBS data, the NSW cancer registry, State hospitalizations, and emergency department visits and mortality data.

The Study is used by both researchers and policymakers to better understand how Australians are aging and using health services to prevent and manage ill-health and disability and guide health system decisions. 45 and Up is the largest ongoing study of healthy aging in the Southern Hemisphere.

New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study – New Zealand 2009 n/a – Northern Ireland Longitudinal Study (NILS) [ 26 ] Panel Northern Ireland 2006 500,000 (comprises about 28% of the Northern Ireland population and approximately 50% of households).

The NILS is a large-scale, representative data-linkage study created by linking data from the Northern Ireland Health Card Registration system to 1981, 1991, 2001 and 2011 census returns and to administrative data from other sources. These include vital events registered with the General Register Office for Northern Ireland (such as births, deaths, and marriages) and the Health Card registration system migration events data. The result is a 30-year-plus longitudinal data set which is regularly being updated. In addition to this rich resource, there is also the potential to link further Health and Social care data via distinct linkage projects (DLPs). The NILS is designed for statistics and research purposes only and is managed by the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency under Census legislation. The data are de-identified at the point of use; access is only from within a strictly controlled 'secure environment' and governed by protocols and procedures to ensure data confidentiality.

Nurses' Health Study Cohort United States 1976 275,000 Most expensive and largest observational health study in history ONS Longitudinal Study [ 27 ] [ 28 ] Panel England and Wales 1974 (data from 1971) 500,000 (1% sample of the population of England and Wales). The LS contains records on over 500,000 people usually resident in England and Wales at each point in time) The sample comprises people born on one of four selected dates of birth and therefore makes up about 1% of the total population. The sample was initiated at the time of the 1971 Census, and the four dates were used to update the sample at the 1981,1991, 2001 and 2011 Censuses and in routine event registrations. Fresh LS members enter the study through birth and immigration and existing members leave through death and emigration. Thus, the LS represents a continuous sample of the population of England and Wales, rather than a sample taken at a one-time point only. It now includes records for over 950,000 study members. In addition to the census records, the individual LS records contain data for events such as deaths, births to sample mothers, emigrations and cancer registrations. Census information is also included for all people living in the same household as the LS member. The LS does not follow up household members in the same way from census to census.

It has followed the same group of pregnant women (Gen1) and their babies (Gen2) who were born into the study between 1989 and 1992. Its original aim was to investigate the benefits of more frequent ultrasound scans on infant health.

[ 31 ] It now studies the impact that early life factors (from the womb onwards) have on health throughout life.

[ 32 ] The Raine Study now includes 4 generations of cohort members.

Rotterdam Study Cohort Netherlands 1990 15,000 Focus is on inhabitants of Ommoord, a suburb of Rotterdam Scottish Longitudinal Study (SLS) [ 33 ] Panel Scotland 1991 274,000 (comprises 5.3% sample of the Scottish population, with records on approximately 274,000 individuals using 20 random birthdates) The SLS is a large-scale linkage study built upon census records from 1991 onwards, with links to vital events (births, deaths, marriages, emigration); geographical and ecological data (deprivation indices, pollution, weather); primary and secondary education data (attendance, Schools Census, qualifications); and links to NHS Scotland ISD datasets, including cancer registrations, maternity records, hospital admissions, prescribing data and mental health admissions. The research potential is considerable. The SLS is a replica of the ONS Longitudinal Study but with a few key differences: sample size, commencement point and the inclusion of certain variables. The SLS is supported and maintained by the SLS Development & Support Unit with a safe-setting at the National Records of Scotland in Edinburgh. Further information and support for potential users is available at SLS-DSU Seattle 500 Study Cohort United States 1974 500 Study of the effects of prenatal health habits on human development Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) Panel Germany 1984 12,000 – Stirling County Study Cohort Canada 1952 639 Long-term study epidemiology of psychiatric disorders.
