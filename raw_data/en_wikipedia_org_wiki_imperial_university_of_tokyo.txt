Founded in 1877 as the nation's first modern university by the merger of several pre-westernisation era institutions, its direct precursors include the Tenmongata , founded in 1684, and the Shōheizaka Institute .

[ 8 ] Although established under its current name, the university was renamed Imperial University ( 帝國大學 , Teikoku daigaku ) in 1886 and was further retitled Tokyo Imperial University ( 東京帝國大學 , Tōkyō teikoku daigaku ) to distinguish it from other Imperial Universities established later.

[ 9 ] It served under this name until the official dissolution of the Empire of Japan in 1947, when it reverted to its original name.

Today, the university consists of 10 faculties , 15 graduate schools , and 11 affiliated research institutes.

[ 10 ] As of 2023, it has a total of 13,974 undergraduate students and 14,258 graduate students.

[ 10 ] The majority of the university's educational and research facilities are concentrated within its three main Tokyo campuses: Hongō , Komaba , and Kashiwa .

[ 11 ] Additionally, UTokyo operates several smaller campuses in the Greater Tokyo Area and over 60 facilities across Japan and globally.

[ 12 ] [ 13 ] UTokyo's total land holdings amount to 326 square kilometres (approximately 80,586 acres or 32,600 hectares), placing it amongst the largest landowners in the country.

[ 14 ] [ 15 ] As of 2025, UTokyo's alumni and faculty include 17 prime ministers of Japan , 20 Nobel Prize laureates , seven astronauts , and a Fields Medalist .

[ 16 ] Additionally, UTokyo alumni have founded some of Japan's largest companies , such as Toyota [ 17 ] and Hitachi .

[ 18 ] UTokyo alumni also held chief executive positions in approximately a quarter of the Nikkei 225 companies in 2014, [ 19 ] a fifth of the total seats in the National Diet in 2023, [ 20 ] [ 21 ] two-thirds of the prefectural governorships in 2023, [ 22 ] and two-thirds of the justiceships at the Supreme Court of Japan in 2024.

[ 23 ] History [ edit ] Origins [ edit ] Asakusa Observatory of the Tenmongata by Hokusai The University of Tokyo traces its roots to three independent institutes founded during the Edo period (1603–1868).

[ 8 ] The oldest, a Shogun-funded Confucian school called Senseiden ( 先聖殿 ) , was founded in 1630 by Razan Hayashi in Ueno .

[ 24 ] This school was renamed the Shoheizaka Institute ( 昌平坂学問所 , Shoheizaka Gakumonjo ) and came to be operated directly by the Tokugawa Shogunate in 1791 as part of the Kansei Reforms . The Tenmongata , established in 1684, was the astronomical research and education arm of the Shogunate.

[ 25 ] It evolved into the Kaisei School ( 開成学校 ) , a school for Western learnings, after the Meiji Restoration . The Kanda Otamagaike Vaccination Centre, established in 1858, [ 26 ] evolved into a school of Western medicine called Tokyo Medical School ( 東京医学校 , Tokyo Igakkō ) . Although plans to establish the country's first university had been in place just after the Meiji Restoration, it was not until around 1875 that it was decided to form the university by merging these schools.

[ 27 ] Founding and early days [ edit ] UTokyo's Akamon (Red Gate), built in 1827, as seen c.

1903 The University of Tokyo was chartered on April 12, 1877, by the Meiji government . Corresponding to the fields covered by the predecessor schools, it started with four faculties: Law , Science , Letters , and Medicine . The Imperial College of Engineering later merged into the university and became the Faculty of Engineering . In 1886 , the university was renamed Imperial University, and it adopted the name Tokyo Imperial University in 1897 after the founding of the next imperial university , what is now Kyoto University .

[ 9 ] By 1888, all faculties had completed their relocation to the former site of the Tokyo house of the Maeda family in Hongo , where they continue to operate today. Among the few extant structures built before this relocation is a gate called Akamon , which has become a widely recognised symbol of the university.

UTokyo students ( Kume , Matsuoka, Akutagawa and Naruse ), c.

1916 During its initial two decades as a modern institution, UTokyo benefited from the contributions of European and American scholars. In 1871, the Meiji Government made a decision about the direction of academic disciplines: engineering was to be learnt from the United Kingdom, mathematics, physics, and international law from France, while politics, economics, and medicine were to be guided by German expertise. Additionally, agriculture and commercial law knowledge was to be sourced from the United States.

[ 28 ] Following this policy, UTokyo and its predecessor institutions sent their graduates to universities in these respective countries and also invited lecturers from them. However, by the 1880s, the Japanese government grew concerned over the spread of French republican and British constitutional monarchist ideals among the faculty and students, and eventually Minister of Education Takato Oki instructed the university to reduce the use of English as a language of instruction, and instead to switch to Japanese.

[ 29 ] This shift coincided with the return of UTokyo alumni who had completed their education in Europe, and these returnees began filling roles that had been predominantly held by foreign scholars.

Interwar period [ edit ] Emperor Hirohito opening a new campus (now known as the Phase II portion of the Komaba Campus ) for the Institute of Aeronautics in 1930 The first half of the Interwar period in Japan was characterised by the spread of liberal ideas, collectively known as Taishō Democracy .

[ 30 ] This movement was ushered in by the concept of Minpon Shugi by Sakuzō Yoshino , as well as Tatsukichi Minobe 's interpretation of sovereignty as inherent to the state rather than the monarchy.

[ 31 ] Both were alumni and professors at the Faculty of Law. Taking advantage of the widespread acceptance of such ideas, prime minister Takaaki Katō , an alumnus of UTokyo, extended suffrage to all males aged 25 and over in 1925, as promised in his manifesto.

[ 32 ] This liberal tendency was also shared among students, exemplified by the labour movement organisation the UTokyo Association of New People (東大新人会, Tōdai Shinjin-kai [ ja ] ) and the UTokyo Settlement (東大セツルメント, Tōdai Settlement [ ja ] ).

[ 33 ] [ 34 ] However, strong reactions against these liberal and socialist ideas also emerged at the university, notably from Shinkichi Uesugi , who mentored and greatly influenced three future prime ministers among his students at UTokyo: Nobusuke Kishi , [ 35 ] Eisaku Satō , [ 35 ] and Takeo Fukuda .

[ 36 ] Great Kanto Earthquake [ edit ] The University of Tokyo suffered immense damage in the Great Earthquake of 1923.

On September 1, 1923, the Great Kanto Earthquake struck the Kanto Plain, inflicting immense damage upon the university. This damage included the complete destruction of almost all main buildings, including the library, as well as the loss of precious scientific and historical samples and data stored in them.

[ 37 ] [ 38 ] This led to a university-wide debate as to whether it should relocate to a larger site, such as Yoyogi , but ultimately, such plans were rejected. Instead, the university purchased additional land in its vicinity, which was still owned by the Maeda family, and expanded there.

Most of the buildings on the Hongo Campus today were built during the reconstruction period in a style known as Uchida Gothic, including Yasuda Auditorium and the General Library .

The reconstruction of the university and its library was brought up in the fourth general assembly of the League of Nations in September 1923, where it was unanimously decided to provide support. The League is said to have been sympathetic especially because the memory of the destruction of KU Leuven in Belgium during the First World War was still fresh.

[ 39 ] The American philanthropist John D. Rockefeller Jr.

personally donated $2 million (approximately $36 million in 2023). The United Kingdom formed a committee led by former Prime Minister Arthur Balfour, 1st Earl of Balfour , and made substantial financial and cultural contributions.

[ 40 ] Rockefeller Jr. and Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester , a younger son of George V , visited the university in 1929, shortly after the new library was completed.

[ 41 ] Prince Henry's visit marked the first Great Ball (大園遊会, Dai-Enyukai ) in several years, which is now known as the May Festival (五月祭, Gogatsusai ).

[ 42 ] A large portion of the buildings on Hongo Campus today were built during this reconstruction period, and their unique Collegiate Gothic style is known as Uchida Gothic ( 内田ゴシック ) after Yoshikazu Uchida , the architect who designed them.

[ 43 ] Another notable change the earthquake brought about at the university was the expansion of its seismology studies . Long having been the only university in the seismically active country , the university was already known for its seismology research, most notably the contributions made by its alumnus and professor, Fusakichi Omori , in quantitatively evaluating the aftershocks of earthquakes ( Omori's law ) and developing a new type of seismometer capable of recording primary waves .

[ 44 ] The university set up an independent seismology department in November 1923 to delve into the causes and effects of earthquakes and to better prepare for future seismic events.

[ 45 ] In 1925, with a government grant, the Earthquake Research Institute was established within the university, and it has been in continuous operation up to today.

[ 46 ] World War II [ edit ] UTokyo’s Second Faculty of Engineering was established in 1942 to meet the growing demand for engineers during the Second World War. It evolved into the Institute of Industrial Science after the war.

In 1941, the Empire of Japan attacked the American bases at Pearl Harbor and joined World War II as an Axis power alongside Germany . By late 1943, as Japan faced significant defeats in the Pacific theatre , a decision was made to enlist university students studying humanities, sending them to battlefields. During the war, 1,652 students and alumni of UTokyo were killed, including those from varied civilian professions such as doctors, engineers, and diplomats, as well as those killed in action.

[ 47 ] They are commemorated in a memorial erected near the front gate of the Hongo Campus. Most students from faculties of engineering and science remained at university or worked as apprentice engineers, as the expertise of science and technology was deemed indispensable for the war effort.

Leo Esaki , who was a student at the department of physics during the war, shared his memory of his university life in 2007: 'The day after the Tokyo Air Raid of 9 March 1945 , during which more than 100 thousand citizens were killed, professor Tanaka conducted class as usual, without mentioning the war at all'.

[ 48 ] The buildings and facilities of UTokyo were largely immune from air raids, allowing education and research activities to continue.

[ 49 ] The increased demand brought about by the war for engineers, especially in the fields of aeronautics, machinery, electronics, and shipbuilding, led to the establishment of the Second Faculty of Engineering ( 第二工学部 ) at UTokyo in 1942. In the newly built Chiba Campus, around 800 students were enrolled at one time, and military engineering research activities were conducted. It was closed in 1951, and as a successor organisation, the Institute of Industrial Science was established on the site of the former headquarters of the Third Infantry Regiment in Roppongi .

[ 50 ] [ 51 ] During the war, the Imperial Army attempted to use the university's facilities several times, including plans to relocate the university to Sendai and use the Hongo Campus as a fortress for the anticipated Allied landing, Operation Downfall , to protect the Imperial Palace . President Yoshikazu Uchida consistently denied these requests by persuading them of the importance of culture, education and research for the country's long-term development. In September 1945, efforts by Uchida and Shigeru Nambara , Dean of the Faculty of Law, prevented the campus from becoming the Allied Headquarters .

[ 52 ] Instead, the Dai-Ichi Seimei Building was chosen. Nambara succeeded Uchida as president in December 1945.

Post-war period [ edit ] Shigeru Nambara , the first post-war president of the university (1945–1951) During the American occupation era following Japan's defeat in World War II , the university dropped the word 'imperial' from its name and reverted to its original name, University of Tokyo. During this period, under American pressure to remove the role pre-war education was believed to have played in sustaining the class structure, Japan's education system was reformed . President Nambara was appointed as the chairman of the National Educational Reform Committee and implemented these changes.

[ 53 ] As a result, UTokyo under merged with two Higher Schools , which were university preparatory boy's boarding schools and thus became a four-year university instead of three-year as it is today in 1949. One of the higher schools that merged with UTokyo, the First Higher School , became the College of Arts and Sciences .

[ 54 ] This new college, operating on the same campus of Komaba as the higher school, took on the responsibility of educating all undergraduates for the first year and a half of their degrees. At the request of SCAP , the Department of Education was separated from the Faculty of Letters to establish the Faculty of Education.

[ 53 ] It was also during this period that UTokyo first opened its doors to female students. The first nineteen female students were matriculated in April 1946.

[ 55 ] University of Tokyo Struggles [ edit ] Main article: 1968–1969 Japanese university protests Yasuda Auditorium became the main site of fierce clashes between protesters and riot police.

The 1960s saw an intensification of student protests across the world, including the Anti-Vietnam War protests and the May 68 events in France. This zeitgeist of the era was prominently felt in Japan as well, symbolised by the 1960 Anpo protests , in which the death of a UTokyo student, Michiko Kamba , caused public outrage. In 1968, the University of Tokyo Struggles ( 東大紛争 , Tōdai Funsō ) began with medical students demanding improvements in internship conditions, in which medical students were forced to work long hours without being paid before being licensed as a doctor.

The conflict intensified with the indefinite strike decision by the students in January 1968 and escalated further following a clash between the students and faculty. Tensions peaked when radical students, most of whom were members of the Zenkyōtō (the All-Campus Joint Struggle Committees), occupied Yasuda Auditorium , leading the university to eventually call in riot police in June— a move seen as abandoning university autonomy. Efforts to resolve the situation began with the resignation of university executives and the appointment of Ichiro Kato as interim president, who started negotiations. The conflict largely ended in January 1969 after a full-scale police operation to remove the occupying students. This operation involved more than 8,500 riot police officers confronting students who fought back with Molotov cocktails and marble stones taken from the auditorium's interior.

[ 56 ] Prime Minister Eisaku Sato , who was an alumnus of UTokyo himself, visited the site the day after the protesters in the auditorium were forcibly removed, and decided to cancel that year's admission process. This led top highschool students to apply reluctantly to other universities such as Kyoto University and Hitotsubashi University , resulting in many applicants who would have been admitted to those universities under normal circumstances failing to gain admission, since applicants are not allowed to apply to multiple prestigious national universities in Japan.

[ 57 ] The aftermath saw 633 prosecutions, and varied sentences, marking a turbulent chapter in the university's history.

[ 58 ] 21st century [ edit ] Women's education [ edit ] The university first admitted female students in 1946. While the student body has remained predominantly male, various attempts have been made to achieve a more equal gender ratio. In 2023, women made up 23 per cent of first-year undergraduates, the highest percentage in the university's history.

[ 59 ] A quarter of graduate students were female in 2022.

[ 60 ] [ 61 ] Reforms in the 21st century [ edit ] UTokyo's Kamiokande project detected cosmic neutrinos for the first time in human history and later proved neutrinos have mass, resulting in Nobel Prizes in 2003 and 2015.

When the British magazine Times Higher Education first published its world university rankings in partnership with QS in 2004, the University of Tokyo was ranked 12th in the world.

[ 62 ] In the latest 2024 edition of the rankings, it is ranked 29th.

[ 63 ] QS, now with its own rankings , placed the UTokyo at 28th.

[ 64 ] As these numbers suggest, there is a widely shared concern that the university is falling behind its counterparts in the world, and in the future it may struggle to provide a suitable environment for quality education and world-class research.

[ 65 ] UTokyo faces a challenging reality.

Japan's long-lasting economic downturn since the 1990s has led to Japanese companies less willing to invest in research and development than before.

[ 66 ] Additionally, the government's Management Expense Grant ( 運営費交付金 ) has been reduced by one per cent annually since 2004.

[ 67 ] This policy, ostensibly aimed at decreasing the university's reliance on the grant and fostering greater independence, has been blamed as one of the main reasons for the decline in the university's competitiveness.

[ 68 ] To address these challenges, UTokyo has implemented various reforms. In 2004, the University of Tokyo Edge Capital Partners (UTEC) was established. This venture capital firm, affiliated with the university, supports entrepreneurship arising from UTokyo's research and development, aiming to drive innovation across society.

[ 69 ] In 2006, the first phase of development was completed at Kashiwa Campus . Situated in the suburb of Kashiwa , this research-focused campus spans 405,313 square metres (100 acres) and has been at the forefront of advanced scientific research since its inception.

[ 70 ] In 2010, in an attempt to further internationalise and diversify its student body, the university increased its autumn enrollment opportunities for international students.

[ 71 ] UTokyo plans to increase the proportion of female faculty members to above a quarter by newly creating positions for 300 female lecturers by 2027.

[ 72 ] In 2021, the newly elected President Teruo Fujii announced the UTokyo Compass, a guiding framework for the university during his tenure, focusing on diversity, dialogue, and creating a better future.

[ 73 ] It emphasises the university's autonomy and creativity in a new era, advocating multifaceted perspectives on knowledge, people, and places. The Compass encourages dialogue throughout the university and society as a pivotal tool for understanding and questioning, fostering inclusivity, and tackling global challenges. In his announcement, he pledged to make UTokyo 'a university that anyone in the world would like to join'.

[ 73 ] Student life [ edit ] Admissions [ edit ] A successful applicant rejoicing on the results day The University of Tokyo's admission process [ ja ] (東大入試, todai nyushi ) is regarded as the most selective in Japan and is almost synonymous with something that is difficult to achieve.

[ 74 ] To apply, candidates must achieve high scores in the Common Test for University Admissions , a standardised multiple-choice examination. UTokyo applicants are required to take at least seven subjects in this examination. Applicants for natural sciences take two mathematics tests, Japanese (which consists of modern language, classics, and Chinese classics), one foreign language, sciences (two from physics, chemistry, biology, and geology), and one social study subject chosen from geography, Japanese history, or world history. Humanities candidates take two social studies subjects and one science subject instead.

[ 75 ] Based on the scores from the Common Test, approximately three times the number of the final admission slots are invited to take the main examination in late February. Based on the idea that regardless of the field of specialisation, all students should have a solid understanding of mathematics and a good command of languages, mathematics, Japanese and one foreign language are compulsory for all applicants.

[ 76 ] For this examination, science candidates are tested in Advanced Mathematics, English, Japanese, and two science subjects. Humanities candidates take Mathematics, a foreign language, Advanced Japanese, and two social studies subjects (options are geography, Japanese history and world history). UTokyo is also known to be the only university that requires all applicants, including those who wish to study natural sciences, to take a non-multiple-choice Japanese and Chinese classics exam. Some applicants are called upon to take an interview.

[ 77 ] Successful candidates are notified in March of the same year and are matriculated in April. The official acceptance rates for undergraduate degrees are relatively [ compared to?

] high, at around 30 per cent, [ 78 ] which is due to the policy of restricting the number of students who can sit for the exam based on the scores from the Common Test.

[ 79 ] Additionally, Japan's university admission policy does not allow applicants to apply to multiple prestigious national universities, [ 80 ] hence non-prospective students tend to switch to other national universities where they are more likely to secure admission.

Junior division [ edit ] Komaba Campus, where all undergraduates spend a year and a half The matriculation ceremony takes place on April 12, the foundation day of the university.

[ 81 ] All first-year students are matriculated at the College of Arts and Sciences at Komaba , which is a remnant of the time when the Komaba Campus served as the separate boarding school known as the First Higher School until 1949.

[ 82 ] There, they spend the first one and a half years of their degrees. Students are required to study a foreign language they have never learnt for at least a year, with classes formed based on their choices. Popular languages include Chinese, French, German, Korean, Spanish, and Russian. These classes are meant to be places where students can interact with peers from different backgrounds and forge long-lasting friendships, especially because they spend a considerable amount of time together. There is a tradition where the previous year's class ( 上クラ , uekura ) invites the juniors to overnight orientation camps ( オリ合宿 , ori gasshuku ) in early April.

[ 83 ] Intense academic competition is common among students in the junior division, as they face matriculation to the senior division ( 進学選択 , shingaku sentaku , or colloquially 進振り , shinfuri ) in September of their second year, where they are assigned to departments based on their grades for the first one and a half years at Komaba.

[ 84 ] The Department of Information Science, the Faculty of Medicine, and the Department of Sociology are amongst the most selective departments in the shingaku sentaku .

[ 85 ] Student housing [ edit ] Despite its roots as a boarding school, most undergraduates at the university either live with their families at home or in non-university accommodation. Since the closure of the Komaba Dormitory [ ja ] (駒場寮, Komaba-ryo ) in August 2001, there has been no on-campus accommodation for domestic students at the university. There are four university dormitories available for undergraduate students: Mitaka, Toshima, Oiwake and Mejirodai.

[ 86 ] In 2021, approximately five per cent of the undergraduate students lived in one of the university dormitories.

[ 87 ] The university offers more options for international students, with on-campus dormitories available for them at Komaba and Kashiwa.

Student newspapers and magazines [ edit ] The Todai Shimbun (東大新聞) is the oldest university newspaper still in operation, with its first issue in 1920.

[ 88 ] The editing committee of the newspaper has produced multiple central figures in the country's publishing industry.

Recruit , a human resources company with the 13th largest market capitalisation among all publicly traded companies in the country as of March 2024, spun off from the Todai Shimbun 's advertisement branch in 1961.

[ 89 ] There are several other newer campus newspapers and magazines, the most notable of which is the Kokasha ( 恒河沙 ).

[ 90 ] The Kokasha 's start-of-term issues include evaluations of lecturers by students from the previous year, and are widely read by students in the junior division to decide which modules to take at the beginning of terms. Additionally, there are several other relatively new student magazines, such as the biscUiT, [ 91 ] the Todai Shimpo and the Komaba Times .

[ 92 ] Apart from those, student web media such as the UT-base [ 93 ] and the UmeeT are widely read by students.

Senior division [ edit ] One of the refectories in Hongo, situated underground After completing the Shingaku Sentaku , second-year students matriculate into senior division departments to specialise in their chosen fields. With the exception of the senior division of the College of Arts and Sciences and the Department of Mathematics, which are located in Komaba, all other senior departments are situated in Hongo . Consequently, approximately 85 per cent of the students start a new chapter of their university life there.

[ 94 ] The Hongo Campus is located closer to the centre of Tokyo, and has more restaurants, cafes, and large museums in the vicinity compared to Komaba. In addition to these, the campus itself has fifteen refectories and restaurants, nine cafes, nine convenience stores and kiosks, one bookshop, two barbershops, and an underground gym with two 25-metre pools.

[ 95 ] [ 96 ] [ 97 ] Yasuda Auditorium, the venue for graduation ceremonies Graduation ceremonies take place towards the end of March. Approximately one-third of the graduates enter the workforce upon graduation, while the remainder continue their studies at graduate schools within the university or at universities abroad.

[ 98 ] Popular places of employment for UTokyo graduates include the university itself, government ministries, global conglomerates such as Sony and Hitachi , consulting firms such as McKinsey & Company and PwC Consulting , trading companies such as Mitsubishi Corp and Mitsui Corp , and investment banks.

[ 99 ] International education [ edit ] As of November 1, 2023, the University of Tokyo hosts 5,106 international students, who represent 17.7 per cent of the total student body. Of these, 4,874 are postgraduate students and 460 are undergraduates. Exchange students and postdoctoral researchers are not included in these numbers.

[ 100 ] At the undergraduate level, there are mainly three routes for those who have not received their secondary education in Japanese to apply to the University of Tokyo. First, individuals with high Japanese proficiency can apply through the special admissions process for students educated overseas ( 外国学校卒業学生特別選考 ).

[ 101 ] Students admitted via this route study alongside their peers who received secondary education in Japanese. International students who apply via this route sometimes spend a year studying the language at preparatory schools before matriculation. Second, there are undergraduate programmes called PEAK (Programs in English at Komaba), which accept applications based on international qualifications such as the A-level , SAT , and International Baccalaureate . All modules in these programmes are taught in English. However, learning Japanese is mandatory, and those confident in their Japanese ability can take modules taught in Japanese in other departments.

[ 102 ] Third, the university offers exchange programmes with universities worldwide.

[ 103 ] There are University-wide Student Exchange Programmes (USTEP) with universities such as Tsinghua University , Princeton University , National University of Singapore and Yale University .

[ 104 ] The College of Arts and Sciences has its own exchange programmes called KOMSTEP with universities such as University of Paris .

[ 105 ] The Faculty of Engineering also has its own exchange programmes, whose partner institutions include Petroleum Institute, Abu Dhabi , University of Cambridge , and Massachusetts Institute of Technology .

[ 106 ] Starting in Autumn 2027, UTokyo plans to offer a five-year programme called the College of Design. The programme aims to 'redefine design as a broad concept (...) based on interdisciplinary knowledge that integrates the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, engineering and other fields'.

[ 107 ] Approximately 100 students will be matriculated annually, with half of them coming from overseas.

[ 108 ] A wider variety of postgraduate programmes are offered in English, [ 109 ] making the international student ratio significantly higher for postgraduate studies (31.32 per cent in November 2023).

[ 100 ] Organisation [ edit ] Teruo Fujii , the 31st president of the University of Tokyo The University of Tokyo operates under a centralised administrative structure, with key policies set by the administrative council, which is chaired by the president.

[ 110 ] However, due to the university's historical development as a merger of various institutions, each of the constituent colleges, faculties, and research institutes maintains its own administrative board. Today, the University of Tokyo is organised into 10 faculties [ 111 ] and 15 graduate schools.

[ 112 ] The leader of the University of Tokyo is known as the president ( 総長 , socho ) and it is a substantive leadership role. The president is elected by the university's board council from among the faculty members for a term of six years. The current president is Teruo Fujii , a scholar in applied microfluidics , who assumed the role in April 2021 and is expected to serve until March 2027.

[ 113 ] Faculties and graduate schools [ edit ] The University of Tokyo's academic structure consists of 10 faculties and their affiliated graduate schools. This organisational structure was introduced as a result of reforms in the 1990s.

It takes multi-disciplinary approaches involving immunology, structural biology, AI, and social sciences, and aims to develop systems for quickly providing effective and safe vaccines and treatments in emergencies.

University of Tokyo library system [ edit ] Main article: University of Tokyo Library One of the reading rooms, General Library (Hongo) The University of Tokyo Library System consists of three comprehensive libraries located on the main campuses—Hongo, Komaba, and Kashiwa—along with 27 other field-specific libraries operated by various faculties and research institutes.

[ 122 ] As of 2024, the University of Tokyo library has a collection of over 10 million books and numerous materials of historical importance.

[ 123 ] This collection ranks it as the second-largest library in Japan, surpassed only by the National Diet Library , which holds a collection of approximately 46.8 million books.

[ 124 ] It also subscribes to about 170,000 journals.

The headquarters of the library is situated in the General Library at Hongo, which underwent thorough renovation in the late 2010s. It now features a 46-metre-deep automated underground storage capable of housing approximately 3 million books.

[ 125 ] University of Tokyo Hospital [ edit ] Main article: University of Tokyo Hospital Outpatient Clinic Building of the hospital The University of Tokyo Hospital is an academic health science centre operated by the Faculty of Medicine . The hospital finds its roots in the Kanda Otamagaike Vaccination Centre, established in 1858. It has 37 clinical examination rooms for a wide range of specialisations including Cardiovascular Medicine and Orthopaedic Surgery, among others. With a capacity of 1,210 beds, the hospital facilitated medical services for 389,830 inpatients and 794,454 outpatients in the fiscal year 2010.

[ 126 ] Newsweek 's World's Best Hospitals 2023 ranks it 17th in the world, 2nd in Asia, and 1st in Japan.

[ 127 ] It serves as the primary hospital for the Imperial Family of Japan , with both the current emperor and the emperor emeritus having undergone major operations there.

[ 128 ] [ 129 ] Museums [ edit ] The University of Tokyo operates eight museums, three of which fall under the purview of the University Museum (UMUT) .

An Egyptian Horus sculpture UMUT Exhibition in UMUT The University Museum, c. 1900 Nikko Botanical Garden Museum Location Operator University Museum The largest university museum in Japan, it has amassed over three million academic materials since 1877. It has hosted numerous planned exhibitions in addition to its permanent exhibition.

Tanashi farm Faculty of Agriculture Agricultural Museum Displays items related to agriculture, including artefacts such as Hachiko 's internal organs.

Yayoi Faculty of Agriculture Apart from the aforementioned museums, the University of Tokyo operates several other public facilities, the most notable of which are two botanical gardens managed by the Faculty of Science : Koishikawa and Nikko.

Koishikawa Botanical Garden Established in 1684, this botanical garden has been operated by the University of Tokyo since its foundation as a modern university in 1877.

[ 130 ] It was in this garden that in 1894 Hirase Sakugoro the discovered spermatozoids of the ginkgo , proving that gymnosperms produce sperm cells. The garden is designated as a National Monument and is open to the public for an admission fee of 500 yen (free for UTokyo students and faculty).

[ 131 ] Nikko Botanical Garden Opened in 1902 as an annex to the Koishikawa Garden, this facility is located in the highland resort town of Nikko and primarily focuses on alpine plants. It has become a popular tourist destination in Nikko and is accessible to the public with an admission fee of 500 yen.

[ 132 ] Finances [ edit ] UTokyo's Income and Expenses, 2021-2022 (avg. exchange rate: 1 US$ = 109.8 yen) Income (billion yen) Expenses (billion yen) Government fundings 93.1 Personnel 106.1 Self-earned income 81.2 Equipment 134.7 External fundings (research grants, endowments) 91.7 Depreciation 27.9 In 2021-2022, the university had an income of 264.1 billion yen. Of this, 93.4 billion yen (35.1%) was funded by the government, primarily through the Expense Management Grant (運営費交付金). Despite being a national university, this grant from the government has been consistently reduced, dropping from 95.5 billion yen in 2005 to 79.9 billion yen in 2022. A total of 81.2 billion yen (30.5%) was self-earned, through sources such as the university hospitals (54.7 billion yen) and academic fees (16.6 billion yen). The remainder, 91.7 billion yen (34.4%), came from external funding, such as research grants and endowments. Although research grants are primarily earned by research groups and not by the university, the university can typically claim up to 30% of them for university operations, which is included in this number.

[ 133 ] The total assets of the university are valued at 1.47 trillion yen as of March 31, 2024. Land holdings make up the largest percentage of this figure, valued at 878 billion yen.

[ 134 ] UTokyo's endowment fund is relatively small, at 44 billion yen as of March 2023. This is because national universities in Japan, including UTokyo, were not allowed to invest in high-risk assets until 2018, so endowments were spent rather than invested until that point.

[ 135 ] The UTokyo Foundation is the primary fundraising arm of the university, and it accepts both endowments for the university as a whole and purpose-specific donations.

[ 136 ] UTokyo's tuition fees have been fixed at 535,000 yen annually for undergraduates and master's students since 2005, regardless of their status (whether domestic or international).

[ 137 ] This makes up approximately 5% of the university's income. However, the decline in government funding and the university's international standing have brought about discussions on whether to raise these fees.

[ 138 ] Notable research [ edit ] Since its foundation in 1877, the University of Tokyo has been involved in a wide range of research across various disciplines. Below is a selection of recognised research efforts conducted by individuals and teams affiliated with the university during their work.

Ito Integral (blue) of a Brownian motion (red) In 1904, Hantaro Nagaoka , an alumnus and professor in the Department of Physics, devised the Saturnian model of the atom. Contrasting with J. J. Thomson's then-popular plum pudding model , Nagaoka's model proposed an atomic structure with a heavy nucleus at the centre and electrons revolving around it.

[ 139 ] Although this model assumed a far larger nucleus than in reality, it inspired Ernest Rutherford 's Rutherford model .

[ 140 ] Teiji Takagi , an alumnus and professor of the Department of Mathematics, proved the Takagi existence theorem in the 1910s. Alongside significant contributions to algebraic number theory , he also introduced the Blancmange curve , a well-known example of a self-affine curve.

In 1951, Kiyoshi Ito , as a doctoral student in the Department of Mathematics, pioneered the theory of stochastic integration and stochastic differential equations , now known as Itô calculus . This theory is best known for its application in mathematical finance , namely in the Black–Scholes equation for option values .

Japan's first satellite, Ohsumi On February 11, 1970, a team at the Institute of Space and Aeronautical Science of the University of Tokyo succeeded in launching the country's first satellite, Ohsumi , making the country the fourth nation in the world to have the capability to send objects into orbit with their own launch vehicles .

[ 141 ] The satellite was carried on a Lambda 4S rocket , a joint project by the Institute of Industrial Science at the university and Nissan . The second satellite of the country, Tansei , was named after the school colour of the university (light blue).

[ 142 ] The institute left the purview of the university as part of a government-led project in the 1980s and eventually formed JAXA , but it still operates in close liaison with the university.

[ 143 ] Yoshinori Ohsumi made a breakthrough in the study of autophagy , a process for cellular waste management and recycling, when he was a professor at the College of Arts and Sciences at the university.

[ 144 ] Using yeast for his experiments, Ohsumi identified key genes involved in autophagy, shedding light on how cells respond to stress such as malnutrition and infections , and linking the process to various diseases including cancer . He received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2016 'for his discoveries of mechanisms for autophagy'.

[ 145 ] Proton-proton reaction On February 23, 1987, the Kamioka Nucleon Decay Experiment observatory , part of the Department of Physics, detected cosmic neutrinos for the first time in human history. This discovery significantly contributed to proving that the sun's energy is generated from hydrogen atoms combining into helium(proton-proton reaction chain).

Masatoshi Koshiba , leader of this research group, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2002.

[ 146 ] In 1998, an expanded version of this neutrino observatory ( Super-Kamiokande ) detected neutrino oscillation , demonstrating that the 'lepton flavour' of neutrinos changes. This discovery, proving that neutrinos have mass, led to Takaaki Kajita receiving the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2015.

[ 147 ] As the successor to Super-Kamiokande, Hyper-Kamiokande is currently under construction, with the operation's start planned for 2027.
