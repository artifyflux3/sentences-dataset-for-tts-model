[ 1 ] Aristanax, a priest of the sun in ancient Berytus in the 2nd century BCE.

[ 2 ] Aristanax, an ancient Greek physician, of whose life nothing is known, and of whose date it can be positively determined only that, as he is mentioned by Soranus of Ephesus , he must have lived some time in or before the second century CE.

[ 3 ] His most notable theory appears to have been that female children ought to be weaned later than male children.
