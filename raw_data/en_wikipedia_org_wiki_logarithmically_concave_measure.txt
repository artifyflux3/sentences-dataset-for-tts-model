[ 1 ] Examples [ edit ] The Brunn–Minkowski inequality asserts that the Lebesgue measure is log-concave. The restriction of the Lebesgue measure to any convex set is also log-concave.

By a theorem of Borell, [ 2 ] a probability measure on R^d is log-concave if and only if it has a density with respect to the Lebesgue measure on some affine hyperplane, and this density is a logarithmically concave function . Thus, any Gaussian measure is log-concave.

The Prékopa–Leindler inequality shows that a convolution of log-concave measures is log-concave.
