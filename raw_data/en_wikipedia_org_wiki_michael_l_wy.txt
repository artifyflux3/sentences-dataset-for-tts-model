He is emeritus research director in social sciences at the CNRS (French National Center of Scientific Research) and lectures at the École des hautes études en sciences sociales ( EHESS ; Paris , France ).  Author of books on Karl Marx , Che Guevara , Liberation Theology , György Lukács , Walter Benjamin , José Carlos Mariátegui , Lucien Goldmann and Franz Kafka , he received the CNRS Silver Medal in 1994.

Academic career [ edit ] A descendant of Jewish immigrants from Vienna , Löwy grew up in São Paulo, Brazil, becoming a committed socialist at 16 (1954), when he discovered the writings of Rosa Luxemburg . He studied at the University of São Paulo , where he studied under Fernando Henrique Cardoso , Florestan Fernandes and Antônio Cândido ); he got his license in Social Sciences in 1960 and lectured in sociology for a year at the university of São José do Rio Preto ( State of São Paulo ).

In 1961 he received a scholarship for a doctorate in Paris , France , which he did under the guidance of the well-known Marxist philosopher and sociologist of culture Lucien Goldmann , who had a lasting influence on his views. He received his PhD from the School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences in 1964, with a thesis on Communist Revolution and Self-Emancipation of the Proletariat in the Work of the Young Marx . The dissertation was published in 1970 as The Young Marx's Theory of Revolution ( La Théorie de la Révolution chez le jeune Marx ).

Soon afterwards Löwy went to Israel where his family had migrated. He learned Hebrew and became a lecturer in political philosophy at the University of Tel Aviv , but his political views led to problems, and the university refused to renew his contract in 1968. He was invited – in an act of  solidarity – to lecture at the University of Manchester , where he became assistant to the sociologist and founder of the New Left , Peter Worsley (1968–1969).

In 1969 Löwy returned to Paris to work with Nicos Poulantzas at the University of Paris VIII (Vincennes), and from that moment on established himself definitively in France. In the 1970s he worked, under the direction of Louis-Vincent Thomas , on his Habilitation ( doctorat d'état ) on György Lukács, presented in 1975 at the University of Paris V (Descartes), and graduated with honours. Löwy lectured in sociology at the University of Paris VIII till 1978 when he was admitted as a researcher at the CNRS.

In 1981 Löwy began also to lecture at the prestigious École des hautes études en sciences sociales (EHESS) in París;  he has also been invited to lecture at Stanford University , UC Berkeley , University of Michigan at Ann Arbor , Columbia University and Harvard University , as well as other US Universities. In 1994 he received the CNRS Silver Medal .

He is emeritus research director in social sciences at the CNRS and teaches at the EHESS. He is member of the editorial board of the journals Archives de sciences sociales des religions , Actuel Marx , ContreTemps  and Écologie et politique, as well as a fellow and regular lecturer at the International Institute for Research and Education in Amsterdam .

Academic interests [ edit ] This section needs additional citations for verification .

Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources in this section. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed.

Find sources: "Michael Löwy" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( April 2025 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Until 1985 most of Löwy's works concerned the sociological and historical study of Marxist thought . This applies not only to his doctorate on the young Marx and his Habilitation on György Lukács, but to most of the essays which he published, some of which were collected in books, as well as for two anthologies, on the National Question (with Georges Haupt and Claudie Weill ) and on Marxism in Latin America .

Marxist epistemology also takes a central place in his work on sociology of knowledge from 1985.

The methodological orientation of his research was inspired by Lucien Goldmann's writings, particularly The Hidden God, whose approach,  associating sociology and history, heterodox Marxism and German sociology, the internal study of cultural works and their connexion to the social structure, served him as starting point.

From the mid-1980s Löwy became interested in the jewish culture that existed in central europe, as well as in Romantic anticapitalism and on the complex interrelations between religion and politics, particularly in Latin America. The concept of elective affinity , borrowed from Max Weber , but re-interpreted, became one of the key methodological tools of his  research. His latest books concern Walter Benjamin ’s Theses on the Philosophy of History (1940), which Löwy considers as one of the most important documents of revolutionary thinking since Marx’s Theses on Feuerbach ; and Franz Kafka as an anti-authoritarian author, with Anarchist sympathies, whose novels are inspired by a sort of "religion of liberty".

In spite of the diversity of its thematic contents, most of Michael Löwy writings, since his PhD on Marx till now, belong to a Marxist and Historicist sociology of culture . Inspired by Lukács and Lucien Goldmann, they also refer to the great tradition of German sociology, from Weber to Karl Mannheim . Their aim is to analyse, interpret and explain the relations between cultural phenomena, particularly religious and political, by situating them in precise social and historical contexts.
