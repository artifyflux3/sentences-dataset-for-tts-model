[Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein"), a key [theoretical physicist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_physics "Theoretical physics") in the 20th century who developed the [theory of relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_relativity "Theory of relativity") and parts of [early quantum theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_quantum_theory "Old quantum theory")

A **physicist** is a [scientist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientist "Scientist") who specializes in the field of [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics"), which encompasses the interactions of matter and energy at all length and time scales in the physical universe.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicist#cite_note-Rosen-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicist#cite_note-2) Physicists generally are interested in the root or ultimate causes of [phenomena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon "Phenomenon"), and usually frame their understanding in mathematical terms. They work across a wide range of [research fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics#Research_fields "Physics"), spanning all length scales: from [sub-atomic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom "Atom") and [particle physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics "Particle physics"), through [biological physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_physics "Biological physics"), to [cosmological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_cosmology "Physical cosmology") length scales encompassing the [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe "Universe") as a whole. The field generally includes two types of physicists: [experimental physicists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_physics "Experimental physics") who specialize in the observation of natural phenomena and the development and analysis of experiments, and [theoretical physicists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_physics "Theoretical physics") who specialize in mathematical modeling of physical systems to rationalize, explain and predict natural phenomena.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicist#cite_note-Rosen-1)

Physicists can apply their knowledge towards solving practical problems or to developing new technologies (also known as [applied physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_physics "Applied physics") or [engineering physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_physics "Engineering physics")).[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicist#cite_note-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicist#cite_note-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicist#cite_note-5)

In an 18th-century experiment in "natural philosophy" (later to be called "physics") English scientist [Francis Hauksbee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Hauksbee "Francis Hauksbee") works with an early electrostatic generator.

The study and practice of physics is based on an intellectual ladder of discoveries and insights from ancient times to the present. Many mathematical and physical ideas used today found their earliest expression in the work of ancient civilizations, such as the [Babylonian astronomers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_astronomy "Babylonian astronomy") and [Egyptian engineers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egyptian_technology "Ancient Egyptian technology"), the Greek philosophers of science and mathematicians such as [Thales of Miletus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thales_of_Miletus "Thales of Miletus"), [Euclid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid "Euclid") in [Ptolemaic Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemaic_Egypt "Ptolemaic Egypt"), [Archimedes of Syracuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes_of_Syracuse "Archimedes of Syracuse") and [Aristarchus of Samos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristarchus_of_Samos "Aristarchus of Samos"). Roots also emerged in ancient Asian cultures such as India and China, and particularly the [Islamic medieval period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics_in_the_medieval_Islamic_world "Physics in the medieval Islamic world"), which saw the development of [scientific methodology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_methodology "Scientific methodology") emphasising [experimentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimentation "Experimentation"), such as the work of [Ibn al-Haytham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_al-Haytham "Ibn al-Haytham") (Alhazen) in the 11th century. The modern scientific worldview and the bulk of physics education can be said to flow from the [Scientific Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_Revolution "Scientific Revolution") in Europe, starting with the work of astronomer [Nicolaus Copernicus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Copernicus "Nicolaus Copernicus") leading to the physics of [Galileo Galilei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei "Galileo Galilei") and [Johannes Kepler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Kepler "Johannes Kepler") in the early 1600s. The work on [mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics "Mechanics"), along with a [mathematical treatment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_physics "Mathematical physics") of physical systems, was further developed by [Christiaan Huygens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christiaan_Huygens "Christiaan Huygens") and culminated in [Newton's laws of motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion "Newton's laws of motion") and [Newton's law of universal gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation "Newton's law of universal gravitation") by the end of the 17th century. The experimental discoveries of [Faraday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday "Faraday") and the theory of [Maxwell's equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations "Maxwell's equations") of electromagnetism were developmental high points during the 19th century. Many physicists contributed to the development of [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics") in the early-to-mid 20th century. New knowledge in the early 21st century includes a large increase in understanding [physical cosmology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_cosmology "Physical cosmology").

The broad and general study of nature, [natural philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_philosophy "Natural philosophy"), was divided into several fields in the 19th century, when the concept of "science" received its modern shape. Specific categories emerged, such as "biology" and "biologist", "physics" and "physicist", "chemistry" and "chemist", among other technical fields and titles.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicist#cite_note-Cahan_Natural_Philosophy-6) The term _physicist_ was coined by [William Whewell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Whewell "William Whewell") (also the originator of the term "scientist") in his 1840 book _The Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences_.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicist#cite_note-7)

A standard undergraduate physics curriculum consists of [classical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics "Classical mechanics"), [electricity and magnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetism "Electromagnetism"), non-relativistic [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics"), [optics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics "Optics"), [statistical mechanics and thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_physics "Thermal physics"), and laboratory experience.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicist#cite_note-8)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicist#cite_note-9)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicist#cite_note-10) Physics students also need training in mathematics ([calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus "Calculus"), [differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation "Differential equation"), [linear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra "Linear algebra"), [complex analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_analysis "Complex analysis"), etc.), and in [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science").

Any physics-oriented career position requires at least an undergraduate degree in physics or applied physics, while career options widen with a [master's degree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master%27s_degree "Master's degree") like MSc, MPhil, MPhys or MSci.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicist#cite_note-NCS-11)

For research-oriented careers, students work toward a [doctoral degree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctoral_degree "Doctoral degree") specializing in a particular field. Fields of specialization include experimental and theoretical [astrophysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics "Astrophysics"), [atomic physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_physics "Atomic physics"), [biological physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_physics "Biological physics"), [chemical physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_physics "Chemical physics"), [condensed matter physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condensed_matter_physics "Condensed matter physics"), [cosmology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology "Cosmology"), [geophysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics "Geophysics"), [gravitational physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity "Gravity"), [material science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materials_science "Materials science"), [medical physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_physics "Medical physics"), [microelectronics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microelectronics "Microelectronics"), [molecular physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_physics "Molecular physics"), [nuclear physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_physics "Nuclear physics"), [optics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics "Optics"), [particle physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics "Particle physics"), [plasma physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics) "Plasma (physics)"), [quantum information science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_information "Quantum information"), and [radiophysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiophysics "Radiophysics").

Experimental physicists at work at the accelerator laboratory of the [University of Jyväskylä](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Jyv%C3%A4skyl%C3%A4 "University of Jyväskylä") (Finland)

The three major employers of career physicists are academic institutions, laboratories, and private industries, with the largest employer being the last. Physicists in academia or government labs tend to have titles such as Assistants, [Professors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor "Professor"), Sr./Jr. Scientist, or [postdocs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postdoctoral_researcher "Postdoctoral researcher"). As per the [American Institute of Physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Institute_of_Physics "American Institute of Physics"), some 20% of new physics Ph.D.s holds jobs in engineering development programs, while 14% turn to computer software and about 11% are in business/education.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicist#cite_note-12) A majority of physicists employed apply their skills and training to interdisciplinary sectors (e.g. [finance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance "Finance")[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicist#cite_note-13)).[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicist#cite_note-14)

Job titles for graduate physicists include [Agricultural Scientist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agricultural_scientist "Agricultural scientist"), [Air Traffic Controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_traffic_controller "Air traffic controller"), [Biophysicist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biophysics "Biophysics"), [Computer Programmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programmer "Computer programmer"), [Electrical Engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_Engineer "Electrical Engineer"), [Environmental Analyst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_analyst "Environmental analyst"), [Geophysicist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysicist "Geophysicist"), [Medical Physicist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_physicist "Medical physicist"), [Meteorologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorologist "Meteorologist"), [Oceanographer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanographer "Oceanographer"), [Physics Teacher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics_teacher "Physics teacher")/[Professor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor "Professor")/[Researcher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Researcher "Researcher"), [Research Scientist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_Scientist "Research Scientist"), [Reactor Physicist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactor_physics "Reactor physics"), [Engineering Physicist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_physicist "Engineering physicist"), [Satellite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite "Satellite") Missions Analyst, [Science Writer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_writer "Science writer"), [Stratigrapher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratigrapher "Stratigrapher"), [Software Engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineer "Software engineer"), [Systems Engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_Engineer "Systems Engineer"), [Microelectronics Engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microelectronic_Engineering "Microelectronic Engineering"), [Radar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar "Radar") Developer, Technical Consultant, etc.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicist#cite_note-15)[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicist#cite_note-16)[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicist#cite_note-17)[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicist#cite_note-18)

The majority of Physics terminal bachelor's degree holders are employed in the private sector. Other fields are academia, government and military service, nonprofit entities, labs and teaching.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicist#cite_note-19)

Typical duties of physicists with master's and doctoral degrees working in their domain involve research, observation and analysis, data preparation, instrumentation, design and development of industrial or medical equipment, [computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing "Computing") and software development, etc.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicist#cite_note-NOC2111-20)

The highest honor awarded to physicists is the [Nobel Prize in Physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Physics "Nobel Prize in Physics"), awarded since 1901 by the [Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Swedish_Academy_of_Sciences "Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences").[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicist#cite_note-21) National physical societies have many prizes and awards for professional recognition. In the case of the [American Physical Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Physical_Society "American Physical Society"), as of 2023, there are 25 separate prizes and 33 separate awards in the field.

Professional certification
--------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Physicist&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Professional certification")]

[Chartered Physicist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chartered_Physicist "Chartered Physicist") (CPhys) is a chartered status and a professional qualification awarded by the [Institute of Physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Physics "Institute of Physics"). It is denoted by the postnominals "CPhys".

Achieving chartered status in any profession denotes to the wider community a high level of specialised subject knowledge and professional competence. According to the Institute of Physics, holders of the award of the Chartered Physicist (CPhys) demonstrate the "highest standards of professionalism, up-to-date expertise, quality and safety" along with "the capacity to undertake independent practice and exercise leadership" as well as "commitment to keep pace with advancing knowledge and with the increasing expectations and requirements for which any profession must take responsibility".

Chartered Physicist is considered to be equal in status to Chartered Engineer, which the IoP also awards as a member of the Engineering Council UK, and other chartered statuses in the UK. It is also considered a "regulated profession" under the European professional qualification directives.

The [Canadian Association of Physicists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Association_of_Physicists "Canadian Association of Physicists") can appoint an official designation called **Professional Physicist** (**P. Phys.**),[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicist#cite_note-22) similar to the designation of [Professional Engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Engineer "Professional Engineer") (P. Eng.). This designation was unveiled at the CAP congress in 1999 and already more than 200 people carry this distinction.

To get the certification, at minimum proof of honours bachelor or higher degree in physics or a closely related discipline must be provided. Also, the physicist must have completed, or be about to complete, three years of recent physics-related work experience after graduation. And, unless exempted, a professional practice examination must also be passed. An exemption can be granted to a candidate that has practiced physics for at least seven years and provide a detailed description of their professional accomplishments which clearly demonstrate that the exam is not necessary.

Work experience will be considered physics-related if it uses physics directly or significantly uses the modes of thought (such as the approach to problem-solving) developed in your education or experience as a physicist, in all cases regardless of whether the experience is in academia, industry, government, or elsewhere. Management of physics-related work qualifies, and so does appropriate graduate student work.

The South African Institute of Physics also delivers a certification of Professional Physicist (Pr.Phys).[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicist#cite_note-23) At a minimum, the owner must possess a three-year bachelors or equivalent degree in physics or a related field and an additional minimum of six years' experience in a physics-related activity; or an Honor or equivalent degree in physics or a related field and an additional minimum of five years' experience in a physics-related activity; or master or equivalent degree in physics or a related field and an additional minimum of three years' experience in a physics-related activity; a Doctorate or equivalent degree in Physics or a related field; or training or experience which, in the opinion of the Council, is equivalent to any of the above.

Professional societies
----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Physicist&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Professional societies")]

Physicists may be a member of a [physical society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_Society_(disambiguation) "Physical Society (disambiguation)") of a country or region. Physical societies commonly publish scientific journals, organize [physics conferences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_conference "Academic conference") and award prizes for contributions to the field of physics. Some examples of physical societies are the [American Physical Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Physical_Society "American Physical Society"), the [Institute of Physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Physics "Institute of Physics"), with the oldest physical society being the [German Physical Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Physical_Society "German Physical Society").
