[ 1 ] [ 2 ] They may be male or female, and of any age, but must be trusted and respected by their community [ 3 ] for their wisdom, cultural knowledge and community service.

[ 4 ] Elders provide support for their communities in the form of guidance, counselling and knowledge, which help tackle problems of health, education, unemployment and racism, [ 5 ] [ 6 ] particularly for younger people. They may be distinguished as one of two types: community elders and traditional elders.

[ 3 ] Elders play an important role in maintenance of culture, songs, oral histories , sacred stories , Aboriginal Australian languages , [ 7 ] and dance, and are also educators who demonstrate leadership and skills in resolving conflicts. Elders also preside over ceremonies and other spiritual practices, and attend to the health and well-being of young people.

[ 6 ] Elders are sometimes addressed by other Aboriginal people as Uncle or Aunty as a mark of respect. The honorific may be used by non-Aboriginal people, but generally only when permission is given to do so.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 1 ] Self-determination advocacy organisation the Aboriginal Provisional Government was initially headed by a "Council of Elders" in accordance with the "traditions and beliefs of Aboriginal groups nationwide".

[ 8 ] The Dreaming Path , a book written by the first Aboriginal CEO of an Australian TAFE , Paul Callaghan, in collaboration with Ngemba elder Paul Gordon, describes the important role played by elders in Aboriginal society. Some organisations have created formal elder-in-residence programs, such as the University of South Australia 's Elders on Campus project, which helps to support Indigenous students.

[ 6 ] [ 9 ] The role of Aboriginal elders has also been the subject of academic research.
