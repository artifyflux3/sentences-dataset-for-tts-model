( July 2022 ) Registration Convention Convention on Registration of Objects Launched into Outer Space ratified signed, but not yet ratified Signed 12 November 1974 Location New York City , New York , United States Effective 15 September 1976 Condition 5 ratifications Signatories 25 Parties 77 Depositary Secretary-General of the United Nations Languages Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish The Convention on Registration of Objects Launched into Outer Space (commonly known as the Registration Convention ) was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1974 [ 1 ] [ 2 ] and went into force in 1976. As of February 2022, it has been ratified by 72 states.

[ 3 ] The convention requires states to furnish to the United Nations with details about the orbit of each space object.  A registry of launchings was already being maintained by the United Nations as a result of a General Assembly Resolution in 1962.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] The Registration Convention and four other space law treaties, including The Outer Space Treaty, The Rescue Agreement, The Liability Convention, and The Moon Agreement are administered by the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space .

[ 6 ] The European Space Agency , European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites , the European Telecommunications Satellite Organization , and the Intersputnik International Organization of Space Communications have submitted declarations of acceptance of rights and obligations according to the convention.

[ 7 ] Current status [ edit ] The register is kept by the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA) and includes [ 8 ] Name of launching State An appropriate designator of the space object or its registration number Date and territory or location of launch Basic orbital parameters ( Nodal period , Inclination , Apogee and Perigee ) General function of the space object Information on registered objects is available at the UNOOSA site List of states parties [ edit ] There are currently 72 states parties to the convention.

[ 3 ] State Signed Burundi 13 November 1975 Iran 27 May 1975 Singapore 31 August 1976 Organizations accepting the rights and obligations [ edit ] Several intergovernmental organizations , which cannot be party to the convention, have nonetheless notified the Secretary-General of the United Nations that they have accepted the rights and obligations of the convention.

[ 3 ] Organization Notified European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites 10 July 1997 European Space Agency 2 January 1979 European Telecommunications Satellite Organization 10 June 2014 Intersputnik International Organization of Space Communications 10 July 2018 Proposals [ edit ] A General Assembly resolution from December 2007 that was accepted by consensus recommended that the data should be extended to include: [ 9 ] Coordinated Universal Time as the time reference for the date of launch; Kilometres, minutes and degrees as the standard units for basic orbital parameters; Any useful information relating to the function of the space object in addition to the general function requested by the Registration Convention The geostationary orbit location, if appropriate Any change of status in operations (e.g., when a space object is no longer functional) The approximate date of decay or re-entry The date and physical conditions of moving a space object to a disposal orbit Web links to official information on space objects Background [ edit ] For many years, concern has existed surrounding the growing number of dead or inactive satellites in space. These litter the part of space near geostationary orbit and pose a major threat, as any collision would produce serious damage or loss of satellites.

[ 10 ] As of 2021, there are nearly 12,000 objects registered in the UNOOSA Online Index of Objects Launched into Outer Space.

[ 11 ] Notes [ edit ] ^ Belarus signed and ratified the Convention as the Byelorussian SSR , which was a republic within the Soviet Union. The current Belarusian state did not begin to exist until after the dissolution of the Soviet Union on 26 December 1991.
