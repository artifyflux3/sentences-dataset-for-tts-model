Situated on the southern shore of Cayuga Lake in the Finger Lakes region of New York , Ithaca is the largest community in the Ithaca metropolitan statistical area . It is named after the Greek island of Ithaca .

[ 4 ] As of 2020, the city's population was 32,108.

[ 5 ] A college town , Ithaca is home to Cornell University , an Ivy League university, [ 6 ] and Ithaca College . Nearby is Tompkins Cortland Community College (TC3), located in Dryden .

[ 7 ] History [ edit ] 17th century [ edit ] Cascadilla Creek gorge An 1882 perspective map of Ithaca Native Americans lived in this area for thousands of years. When reached by Europeans, this area was controlled by the Cayuga , one of the five tribes comprising the Iroquois Confederacy .

Jesuit missionaries from New France in present-day Quebec had a mission to convert the Cayuga as early as 1657.

[ 8 ] 18th century [ edit ] Saponi and Tutelo peoples, Siouan-speaking tribes, later occupied lands at the south end of Cayuga Lake . Dependent tributaries of the Cayuga, they had been permitted to settle on the tribe's hunting lands at the south end of Cayuga Lake, and in Pony (originally Sapony) Hollow of present-day Newfield, New York . Remnants of these tribes had been forced from Virginia and North Carolina by tribal conflicts and European colonial settlement. Similarly, the Tuscarora people , an Iroquoian-speaking tribe from the Carolinas, migrated after defeat in the Yamasee War ; they settled with the Oneida people and became the sixth nation of the Haudenosaunee, with chiefs stating the migration was complete in 1722.

During the American Revolutionary War , four of the then six Iroquois nations helped the British attempt to crush the revolution, although bands made decisions on fighting in a highly decentralized way. Conflict with the rebel colonists was fierce throughout the Mohawk Valley and Western New York . In retaliation for conflicts to the east and resentment at the way in which the Iroquois made war, the 1779 Sullivan Expedition was conducted against the Iroquois in the west of the state, destroying more than 40 villages and stored winter crops and forcing their retreat from the area.

[ 9 ] It destroyed the Tutelo village of Coregonal, located near what is now the junction of state routes 13 and 13A just south of Ithaca. Most Iroquois were forced from the state after the Revolutionary War, but some remnants remained. The state sold off the former Iroquois lands to stimulate development and settlement by non-indigenous Americans; lands were also granted as payment to veterans of the war.

Within the current boundaries of Ithaca, Native Americans maintained a temporary hunting camp at the base of Cascadilla Gorge. In 1788, eleven men from Kingston, New York , came to the area with two Lenape guides, to explore what they considered wilderness. The following year Jacob Yaple, Isaac Dumond, and Peter Hinepaw returned with their families and constructed log cabins.

[ 8 ] That same year Abraham Bloodgood of Albany obtained a patent from the state for 1,400 acres, which included all of the present downtown west of Tioga Street.

[ 10 ] In 1790, the federal government and state began an official program to grant land in the area, known as the Central New York Military Tract , as payment for service to Continental Army soldiers of the Revolutionary War, when the newly established federal government was cash poor. Most local land titles trace back to these Revolutionary war grants. However, the Bloodgood tract was not part of the state bounties to veterans. It was originally granted to a member of the state militia, Martinus Zielie, as a bounty under a different law for recruiting men to enlist in the Continental Army.

As part of this process, the Central New York Military Tract , which included northern Tompkins County, was surveyed under the direction of Simeon De Witt , Bloodgood's son-in-law and the Surveyor General of New York. Simeon commissioned his first cousin, Moses De Witt, after whom DeWitt, New York , is named, to survey the area around the south end of Cayuga Lake. Both Simeon and Moses were first cousins of DeWitt Clinton through his mother, Mary De Witt, who married James Clinton, brother of Governor George Clinton . The Commissioners of Lands of New York State (chairman Gov. George Clinton) met in 1790. The Military Tract township in which Ithaca is located was named the Town of Ulysses . A few years later De Witt moved to Ithaca, then called variously "The Flats," "The City," or "Sodom"; [ 8 ] [ 11 ] he renamed it for the Greek island home of Ulysses in the spirit of the multitude of settlement names in the region derived from classical literature , such as Aurelius , Ovid , and especially of Ulysses, New York , the town that contained Ithaca at the time.

[ 9 ] Around 1791, De Witt surveyed what is now the downtown area into lots and sold them at modest prices. That same year John Yaple built a grist mill on Cascadilla Creek.

On November 11, 1794, the Treaty of Canandaigua was ratified between approximately 50 Sachems and leaders of the Iroquois and Timothy Pickering on behalf of President George Washington and the United States of America .

[ 12 ] Among the treaty's numerous provisions, the Cayuga agreed to officially cede their right to all land in present-day Tompkins County in exchange for an approximately 64,000 acre reservation at the north end of Cayuga Lake .

[ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] Today, the Cayuga Nation of New York , the Cayuga signatories' ancestors, still point to the Treaty of Canandaigua as evidence of their legal sovereignty.

[ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] Ithaca's first frame house was erected in 1800 by Abram Markle.

[ 8 ] In 1804, the village had a postmaster and, in 1805, a tavern.

[ 19 ] : 1807 19th century [ edit ] State Street in Ithaca, c.

1901 Ithaca Gun Company's Annie Oakley gun in 1916 Ithaca became a transshipping point for salt from curing beds near Salina, New York , to buyers south and east. This prompted construction in 1810 of the Owego Turnpike.

[ 19 ] : 1809 When the War of 1812 cut off access to gypsum in Nova Scotia , which was used for fertilizer, Ithaca became the center of trade in Cayuga gypsum.

[ 10 ] The Cayuga Steamboat Company was organized in 1819 and, in 1820, launched the first steamboat on Cayuga Lake, the Enterprise.

[ 10 ] In 1821, the village was incorporated at the same time the Town of Ithaca was organized and separated from the parent Town of Ulysses. In 1834, the Ithaca and Owego Railroad's first horse drawn train began service, [ 9 ] connecting traffic on the east–west Erie Canal , which was completed in 1825, with the Susquehanna River to the south to expand the trade network.

With the Long Depression of 1837, the Ithaca and Owego Railroad was re-organized as the Cayuga and Susquehanna Railroad . It was re-engineered with switchbacks downhill into Ithaca in the late 1840s. In the late 20th century, a short section of its abandoned right-of-way in the City and Town of Ithaca was used for the South Hill Recreation Way .

However, easier early railroad routes were constructed that bypassed Ithaca, such as that of the Syracuse, Binghamton & New York, built in 1854. In the decade following the American Civil War , railroads were built from Ithaca to Auburn , Geneva , Cayuga , Cortland , Elmira , and Athens, Pennsylvania , mainly with financing from Ezra Cornell . These were all branch-lines, since the city, located on a steep hill by the lake, prevented it from being directly connected to a major transportation artery.

In 1892, when the Bethlehem, Pennsylvania -based Lehigh Valley Railroad built its main, double-track freight line from Van Etten Junction to Geneva and on to Buffalo, New York , it bypassed Ithaca and Auburn to the west, running via Burdett and eastern Schuyler County on easier grades, just as the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad had  done a decade earlier, in 1882, with its own, new Binghamton-Buffalo mainline extension to the south and west, via Owego, Waverly, Bath, and Dansville. Two of three daily New York City -Buffalo roundtrip passenger trains served Ithaca on the older, original Lehigh Valley Ithaca Branch between Van Etten Junction and Geneva, until discontinuance of the Black Diamond daylight train, on May 11, 1959. On May 25, 1959, the overnight "Maple Leaf" train was shifted back to the Ithaca Branch from the main line via Burdett, and operated on this route until the Lehigh Valley Railroad discontinued this last passenger service on February 4, 1961.

[ 20 ] In the late 19th century, more industry developed in Ithaca. In 1883, William Henry Baker and his partners founded the Ithaca Gun Company , which manufactured shotguns. The original factory was located in the Fall Creek neighborhood of the city, on a slope later known as Gun Hill, where the nearby waterfall supplied the main source of energy for the plant. The company became an icon in the hunting and shooting world, and its shotguns were known for their fine decorative work. Wooden gunstocks with knots or other imperfections were donated to the high school woodworking shop to be made into lamps.

[ 21 ] John Philip Sousa and trick-shooter Annie Oakley favored Ithaca Gun Company guns. In 1937, the company began producing the Ithaca 37 , based on a 1915 patent by noted firearms designer John Browning . Its 12-gauge shotguns were the standard used for decades by the New York City Police Department and Los Angeles Police Department .

[ 22 ] In 1885, Ithaca Children's Home was established on West Seneca Street. The orphanage had two programs at the time: a residential home for both orphaned and destitute children, and a day nursery.

[ 23 ] The village established its first trolley in 1887. Ithaca developed as a small manufacturing and retail center and was incorporated as a city in 1888. The largest industrial company in the area was Morse Chain, elements of which were absorbed into Emerson Power Transmission on South Hill and Borg Warner Automotive in Lansing, New York .

Ithaca claims to be the birthplace of the ice cream sundae , created in 1892 when fountain shop owner Chester Platt "served his local priest vanilla ice cream covered in cherry syrup with a dark candied cherry on top. The priest suggested the dessert be named after the day, Sunday, although the spelling was later changed out of fear some would find it offensive." [ 24 ] The local Unitarian church, where the priest, Rev. John Scott, preached, has an annual "Sundae Sunday" every September in commemoration.

[ 11 ] [ 25 ] Ithaca's claim has long been disputed by Two Rivers, Wisconsin . Also in 1892, the Ithaca Kitty became one of the first mass-produced stuffed animal toys in the United States.

[ 26 ] 20th century [ edit ] A 1915 still from The New Adventures of J. Rufus Wallingford , a Wharton Studio production In 1900, Cornell University anatomy professor G. S. Moler made an early movie using frame-by-frame technology. For The Skeleton Dance, he took single-frame photos of a human skeleton in varying positions, giving the illusion of a dancing skeleton. During the early 20th century, Ithaca was an important center in the silent film industry. These films often featured the local natural scenery. Many of these films were the work of Leopold Wharton and his brother Theodore ; The Wharton Studio was on the site of what is now Stewart Park .

[ 11 ] In 1903, a typhoid epidemic resulting from poor sanitation infrastructure devastated the city. Not having access to unpolluted water was one suspicion to the cause of the outbreak because "[r]efuse and the contents of the early sewer system dumped directly into the inlet".

[ 27 ] One out of ten citizens fell ill or died.

[ 28 ] Local residents lost fifty-one people to the illness that year, but there was "an average of thirty-nine cases each year" for the consecutive ten years following.

[ 29 ] The Star Theatre on East Seneca Street was built in 1911 and became the most popular vaudeville venue in the region. Wharton movies were also filmed and shown there.

[ 30 ] After the film industry centralized in Hollywood, production in Ithaca effectively ceased. Few of the silent films made in Ithaca have been preserved.

Ithaca had film studio activity during the silent film era including Wharton Studio .

[ 31 ] After World War II , the Langmuir Research Labs of General Electric developed as a major employer; the defense industry continued to expand. GE's headquarters were in Schenectady, New York, to the northeast in the Mohawk Valley.

Although Ithaca has a history of Ku Klux Klan activity, including a cross-burning in 1923 and 1924, "the peak years of Klan activity in Ithaca were 1923-1925" and it represented only a fraction of the population.

[ 32 ] Ithaca is known for its political activism regarding civil rights and environmental issues.

[ 33 ] “Martin Luther King Jr. came to speak twice in Ithaca, in 1960 and 1961”.

[ 33 ] The annual Ithaca Festival, which often takes place on the Ithaca Commons or Stewart Park , frequently centers around themes promoting "a political statement into a cultural and festive event” [ 34 ] 21st century [ edit ] The west entrance to Ithaca Commons at Cayuga Street The Ithaca Gun Company tested their shotguns behind the plant on Lake Street; the shot fell into the Fall Creek gorge at the base of Ithaca Falls . Lead accumulated in the soil in and around the factory and gorge. A major lead clean-up effort sponsored by the United States Superfund took place from 2002 to 2004, managed through the Environmental Protection Agency .

[ 35 ] The old Ithaca Gun building has been dismantled. It was scheduled to be replaced by the development of an apartment complex on the cleaned land.

The former Morse Chain company factory on South Hill, now owned by Emerson Power Transmission, was the site of extensive groundwater and soil contamination from its industrial operations.

[ 36 ] Emerson Power Transmission has been working with the state and South Hill residents to determine the extent and danger of the contamination and aid in cleanup.

In 2004, Gayraud Townsend, a 20-year-old senior in Cornell's School of Industrial and Labor Relations, was sworn in as alderman of the city council: the first black man to be elected to the council and the youngest African American to be elected to office in the United States.

[ 37 ] He served his full term and has mentored other student politicians.

[ 38 ] In 2011, Svante Myrick , a 2009 Cornell University graduate, was elected as the youngest mayor of the city of Ithaca.

[ 39 ] In 2023, President of the Cornell Student Assembly Patrick Kuehl launched a secret write-in campaign and succeeded in unseating Alderperson Jorge Defandini, another Cornell alumnus, from the Ithaca Common Council.

[ 40 ] Kuehl had collaborated with fellow students Alderperson Tiffany Kumar and Alderperson-elect Clyde Lederman and canvassed for several months but did not publicly express his intent to run for the seat until the evening of election day.

[ 41 ] Kuehl received an inordinate number of provisional ballots and absentee ballots from residents of the Sigma Phi and Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity houses.

[ 42 ] Various Ithaca and Cornell groups condemned the secret campaign as undemocratic.

[ 43 ] Geography [ edit ] Hemlock Gorge along Fall Creek before emptying into Beebe Lake on Cornell's campus The valley in which Cayuga Lake is located is long and narrow with a north–south orientation. Ithaca is located at the southern end (the "head") of the lake, but the valley continues to the southwest behind the city. Originally a river valley, it was deepened and widened by the action of Pleistocene ice sheets over the last several hundred thousand years.

[ 44 ] These ice sheets gouged the land crosswise to preexisting streams, producing hanging valleys . Once the last ice sheets receded — around twenty or thirty thousand years ago — these streams cut deep into the steep hillsides, forming the many distinctive gorges, rapids, and waterfalls seen in the region; examples include Fall and Cascadilla Creeks in Ithaca, and nearby Buttermilk Falls , Enfield Gorge , and Taughannock Falls .

[ 44 ] Cayuga Lake is the most recent lake in a long series of lakes which developed as the ice retreated northward.

[ 44 ] The lake drains to the north, and was formed behind a dam of glacial debris called a moraine .

Rock in the region is predominantly Devonian shale and sandstone .

[ 44 ] North of Ithaca, it is relatively fossil rich. The world-renowned fossils found in this area can be examined at the Museum of the Earth .

Glacial erratics can also be found in the area.

Ithaca was founded on flat land just south of the lake — land that formed in fairly recent geological times when silt filled the southern end of the lake. The city ultimately spread to the adjacent hillsides, which rise several hundred feet above the central flats: East Hill, West Hill, and South Hill. The Cornell campus is loosely bounded to the north and south by Fall and Cascadilla Creeks, respectively.

The natural vegetation of the Ithaca area is northern temperate broadleaf forest . It is dominated by deciduous trees , including maple, sycamore, black walnut, birch, and oak; coniferous trees include white pine, Norway spruce, and eastern hemlock.

[ 45 ] The city of Ithaca has a rich diversity of tree plantings, with over 190 species, including cherry, southern magnolia, and ginkgo.

[ 45 ] In addition to visual beauty, this species diversification helps reduce the impact of arboreal epidemics, such as that caused by the emerald ash borer .

Summers are warm but brief, and it is cool-to-cold the rest of the year, with long, snowy winters; an average of 67 in (170 cm) of snow falls per year. In addition, frost may occur any time of year except mid-summer.

Winter is typically characterized by freezing temperatures, cloudy skies and light-to-moderate snows, with some heavier falls; the largest snowfall in one day was 26.0 in (66 cm) on February 14, 1914. But the season is also variable; there can be short mild periods with some rain, but also outbreaks of frigid air with night temperatures down to −10 °F (−23 °C) or lower. Summers usually bring sunshine, along with moderate heat and humidity, but also frequent afternoon thunderstorms. Nights are pleasant and sometimes cool. Occasionally, there can be heatwaves, with temperatures rising into the 90 °F (32 °C) to 95 °F (35 °C) range, but they tend to be brief.

The average date of the first freeze is October 5, and the average date of the last freeze is May 15, giving Ithaca a growing season of 141 days. The average date of the first and last snowfalls are November 12 and April 7, respectively. The hardiness zone is between 5b and 6a. Extreme temperatures range from −25 °F (−32 °C) as recently as February 2, 1961, up to 103 °F (39 °C) on July 9, 1936.

[ 46 ] The valley flatland has slightly cooler weather in winter, and occasionally Ithaca residents experience simultaneous snow on the hills and rain in the valley. The phenomenon of mixed precipitation (rain, wind, and snow), common in the late fall and early spring, is known tongue-in-cheek as ithacation to many of the local residents.

[ 47 ] Due to the microclimates created by the impact of the lakes, the region surrounding Ithaca ( Finger Lakes American Viticultural Area ) experiences a short but adequate growing season for winemaking similar to the Rhine Valley wine district of Germany.

Greater Ithaca [ edit ] Location of the Ithaca-Cortland census designated area and its components: Ithaca Metropolitan Statistical Area Cortland Micropolitan Statistical Area The term "Greater Ithaca" encompasses both the City and Town of Ithaca, as well as several smaller settled places within or adjacent to the Town: Municipalities Village of Groton Village of Lansing the southern part of the Town of Lansing Village of Cayuga Heights Hamlet of Forest Home Hamlet of South Hill Census-designated places East Ithaca Northeast Ithaca Northwest Ithaca Government [ edit ] See also: List of mayors of Ithaca, New York Ithaca City Hall at 108 East Green Street There are two governmental entities in the area: the Town of Ithaca and the City of Ithaca . The Town of Ithaca is one of the nine towns comprising Tompkins County. The City of Ithaca is surrounded by, but legally independent of, the Town.

The City of Ithaca has a council-manager government .

[ 61 ] The charter of the City of Ithaca provides for a full-time mayor and city judge, each independent and elected at-large . Since 1995, the mayor has been elected to a four-year term, and since 1989, the city judge has been elected to a six-year term. At a referendum in 2022, city voters approved a city charter amendment adopting from a council–manager government in place of a mayor–council government .

[ 62 ] The city's first city manager, Deb Mohlenhoff, took office on 1 January 2024.

[ 63 ] Since 1983, the city has been divided into five wards. Each elects two representatives to the city council, known as the Common Council, for staggered four-year terms. In March 2015, the Common Council unanimously adopted a resolution recognizing freedom from domestic violence as a fundamental human right .

[ 64 ] In September 2023, the Common Council unanimously passed an extensive local ordinance to "protect, defend and shield transgender individuals".

[ 65 ] Since students won the right to vote where they attend colleges, some have become more active in local politics. In 2004, Gayraud Townsend, a 20-year-old senior in Cornell's School of Industrial and Labor Relations, was sworn in as alderman of the city council, representing the fourth Ward. He was the first black male to be elected to the council and was then the youngest African American to be elected to office in the United States.

[ 37 ] In 2011, Cornell graduate Svante Myrick was elected Mayor of the City of Ithaca, becoming the youngest mayor in the city's history.

[ 39 ] In December, 2005, the City and Town governments began discussing opportunities for increased government consolidation, including the possibility of joining the two into a single entity. This topic had been previously discussed in 1963 and 1969.

Cayuga Heights , a village adjacent to the city on its northeast, voted against annexation into the city of Ithaca in 1954.

Politics [ edit ] Mayoral election results [ 66 ] [ 67 ] Year Democratic Republican Independent 1975 Edward Conley 61% Anne Jones 38% 1977 Edward Conley 54% Vincent Giordano 46% 1979 Raymond Bordoni 30% William Shaw 27% 1981 John Gutenberger 47% William Shaw 53% 1983 John Gutenberger 58% William Shaw 42% 1985 John Gutenberger 68% Charlotte Stone 32% 1987 John Gutenberger 72% Reuben Weiner 28% 1989 Benjamin Nichols 52% Jean Cookingham 48% 1991 Benjamin Nichols 53% Mark Finkelstein 47% 1995 Benjamin Nichols 48% Alan Cohen 51% 1999 Daniel Hoffman 46% Alan Cohen 54% 2003 Carolyn Peterson 61% John Saul 27% 2007 Carolyn Peterson 98% 2011 Svante Myrick 54% Janis Kelly 7% Wade Wykstra 25% 2015 Svante Myrick 89% 2019 Svante Myrick 76% Adam Levine 23% 2023 Robert Cantelmo 86% Janis Kelly 9% Politically, the majority of the city's voters (many of them students) have supported liberalism and the Democratic Party . A November 2004 study by ePodunk lists it as New York's most liberal city.

[ 68 ] This contrasts with the more conservative leanings of the generally rural Upstate New York region; the city's voters are also more liberal than those in the rest of Tompkins County . In 2008, Barack Obama , running against New York State's US Senator Hillary Clinton, won Tompkins County in the Democratic Presidential Primary, the only county that he won in New York State.

[ 69 ] Obama won Tompkins County (including Ithaca) by a wide margin of 41% over his opponent John McCain in the November 2008 election. Tompkins County is currently part of New York's 19th congressional district.

[ citation needed ] Railways [ edit ] Lehigh Valley Railroad station , built in 1898, has been refurbished and is now a Chemung Canal Trust Company bank branch A 1907 illustration of a streetcar passing Eddy Gate, the main entrance to Cornell University at the time A Norfolk Southern Railway locomotive Into the mid-20th century, it was possible to reach Ithaca by passenger rail. At least two trains per day serviced Ithaca along the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad until 1942, or the Lehigh Valley Railroad . The trip took about seven hours from New York City , about eight hours from Philadelphia , and about three hours from Buffalo, New York .

[ 109 ] There has been no passenger rail service since February 4, 1961.

Beginning in the 1870s, there were trains to Buffalo via Geneva, New York , to New York City via Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania on the Lehigh Valley Railroad , to Hoboken, New Jersey with a train change in Owego via Binghampton and Scranton, Pennsylvania on the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad , and to the U.S. Northeast via Cortland, New York on the Lehigh Valley Railroad.

[ 110 ] [ 111 ] [ 112 ] The Lehigh Valley's top New York City-Ithaca-Buffalo passenger train, the daylight Black Diamond , was publicized as "The Handsomest Train in the World," but it took a roundabout route to New York City, traveling south to Waverly, New York , to Wilkes-Barre and Easton , and then across New Jersey . It was named after the railroad's largest commodity, anthracite coal, and made its last run on May 11, 1959.

Until March 1942, the Lackawanna Railroad operated two shuttle trains a day between Ithaca and Owego, where passengers could transfer to westbound trains to Buffalo and Chicago or eastbound to Binghamton, Scranton, Pennsylvania , and Hoboken, New Jersey , across the Hudson River from New York City.

[ 113 ] Until September 15, 1958, the Lackawanna maintained Syracuse-Binghamton service through nearby Cortland , to the east.

[ 114 ] Until May 11, 1959, two Lehigh Valley trains a day made both westbound and eastbound stops in Ithaca.

[ 115 ] The last passenger train making stops in Ithaca was the Lehigh Valley's overnight Maple Leaf , which discontinued in February 1961.

[ 116 ] [ 117 ] Within Ithaca, electric railways ran along Stewart Avenue and Eddy Street.

[ 109 ] Ithaca was the fourth community in New York state with a street railway; streetcars ran from 1887 until the summer of 1935.

[ 118 ] [ 119 ] In December 2018, the Ithaca Central Railroad, a Watco subsidiary, took over operation via lease of the 48.8-mile (78.5 km) Norfolk Southern Ithaca Secondary line from Sayre, Pennsylvania to the Cargill Salt mine site on the eastern shore of Cayuga Lake, near Myers Point. Unit coal trains carrying bituminous coal were delivered to the Ithaca Central at Sayre by Norfolk Southern for less than eight months afterward, traveling to the Ridge site of the Cayuga Operating Company: a coal-burning power plant known as Milliken Station during NYSEG ownership. The power plant closed on August 29, 2019. As of 2022, there are ambitious, proposed plans to convert its brownfield site into a major data center. The main rail freight traffic is now salt from the Cargill salt mine farther north. Norfolk Southern's tracks, headed north on the former Lehigh Valley Auburn and Ithaca Branch, include a distinctive section in Ithaca that runs along the side of Fulton St. (NY13 southbound), although not in the street itself.

In 1997, Utne Reader named Ithaca "America's most enlightened town".

[ 120 ] As of 2007, according to ePodunk 's Gay Index, Ithaca has a score of 231, versus a national average score of 100.

[ 121 ] Like many small college towns, Ithaca has also received accolades for having a high overall quality of life.

In its earliest years, during the frontier days, what is now Ithaca was briefly known by the names "The Flats" and "Sodom," [ 6 ] [ 122 ] [ 123 ] the name of the Biblical city of sin , due to its reputation as a town of "notorious immorality", [ 124 ] a place of horse racing, gambling, profanity, Sabbath-breaking and readily-available liquor.

Simeon De Witt renamed the town Ithaca for Odysseus' home island in the early 19th century, though nearby Robert H. Treman State Park still contains Lucifer Falls. Ithaca is primarily known for its growing wineries and microbreweries, live music, colleges and small dairy farms.
