[ 2 ] [ 3 ] It was the first extrasolar planet to be confirmed by the James Webb Space Telescope .

[ 4 ] It completes an orbit every 2 days and is 99% the diameter of Earth. It is also one of the most similar-to-Earth exoplanets discovered, in terms of radius.

[ 5 ] Physical characteristics [ edit ] LHS 475 b has a radius equivalent to 99% of the Earth's radius and a mass equivalent to 91.4% of the Earth's mass .

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] It completes an orbit around its star in about 2 days and is most likely tidally locked .

[ 7 ] Atmosphere [ edit ] It is not yet known whether LHS 475 b has an atmosphere . It is possible that, in fact, it does not, but there are some atmospheric compositions that have not been ruled out, such as an atmosphere made up of 100% carbon dioxide , which is difficult to detect.

[ 6 ] [ 8 ] As it is very hot, with a temperature of 313 ¬∞C , if clouds are detected on its surface, this could suggest that LHS 475 b is similar to Venus , which has an atmosphere made up of carbon dioxide surrounded by thick clouds.

[ 6 ] Discovery and observation [ edit ] The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) telescope indicated the existence of an exoplanet around the star LHS 475 through transit information.

[ 6 ] [ 9 ] Transmission spectrum of LHS 475 b from NIRSpec .

On August 31, 2022, the James Webb Space Telescope 's NIRSpec instrument captured the exoplanet with just two transit observations and observed its transmission spectrum. Confirmation of LHS 475 b by the James Webb Space Telescope was published on January 11, 2023.
