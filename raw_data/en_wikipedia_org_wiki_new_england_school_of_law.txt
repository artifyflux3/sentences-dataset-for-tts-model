Enrollment 602 [ 2 ] Faculty 109 [ 3 ] [ 4 ] USNWR ranking 159th (tie) (2024) [ 5 ] Bar pass rate 77.03% [ 6 ] Website [2] New England Law Boston (formerly New England School of Law , and styled as New England Law | Boston ) [ a ] is a private law school in Boston , Massachusetts . It was founded as Portia School of Law in 1908 and is located in downtown Boston near the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court.

[ 8 ] According to New England Law's official 2018 ABA-required disclosures, the class of 2018 had a full-time employment rate of 83.4% with 4% pursuing an additional degree.

[ 9 ] Eight U.S. Supreme Court justices have visited, lectured, or taught in the summer-abroad programs at New England Law.

[ 8 ] History [ edit ] The Portia School of Law [ edit ] The Portia School of Law started informally in 1908 when Arthur W. MacLean (1880–1943), a graduate of the Boston University School of Law and a professor at Suffolk University Law School , agreed to tutor two young women who were studying for the Massachusetts bar examination. At the time, few options were available to women seeking a legal education in New England. Soon afterwards, MacLean rented space at 88 Tremont Street , began admitting students, and took on a second faculty member.

[ 10 ] MacLean's wife, Bertha, named the school after the character Portia in Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice . In the play, Portia disguises herself as a young man and impersonates a judge; she also ruins Shylock, the moneylender. The Portia School of Law was the only law school in the country exclusively for women.

[ 11 ] The school was incorporated in 1918. By this time it had 91 students.

[ 12 ] The following year, the Massachusetts legislature granted the school the power to confer the degree of Bachelor of Laws (LL.B), and the school was reincorporated as the Portia Law School. In 1920 the school awarded its first LL.B degrees to 39 women.

[ 10 ] The school was one of the few that offered part-time enrollment, enabling working-class women to pursue their studies while supporting themselves.

[ 12 ] In 1920, the school outgrew its space on Tremont Street and moved to a townhouse at 45 Mt. Vernon Street on Beacon Hill . The Portia Law School was granted the authority to confer the degree of Master of Laws (LL.M.) in 1926; five graduates were awarded the LL.M. the following year.

[ 12 ] The Portia Law School was integrated from its earliest days.

Blanche E. Braxton , who graduated in 1921, became the first African-American woman admitted to the Massachusetts bar in 1923. Another Portia graduate, Dorothy Crockett, became the first African-American woman admitted to the Rhode Island bar in 1932.

[ 13 ] The former site of the Portia Law School at 45 Mount Vernon Street is a stop on the Boston Women's Heritage Trail .

[ 11 ] Admission of male students [ edit ] The school began admitting male students out of financial necessity in the 1920s. In 1930, the school's first two male graduates received the LL.M. degree.

[ 10 ] From 1940 to 1950, the men's program was referred to as the Calvin Coolidge Law School.

[ 14 ] As the school entered the 1950s it saw its student body shift from a student body that had a majority female population to a predominantly male student body.

[ 15 ] 1963 saw Portia Law School begin the process of applying for American Bar Association accreditation, [ 15 ] and some of the steps the school took included restructuring its board of governors and launching the school's first law review .

[ 15 ] In 1969, the school changed its name to New England School of Law to coincide with its accreditation granted by the ABA.

[ 18 ] Rebranding [ edit ] Also, in 2008, New England School of Law began a new campaign to rebrand itself as "New England Law | Boston", with the purpose to put an emphasis on its location.

[ 20 ] In December 2020, long-time president John F. O'Brien stepped down and former United States Senator from Massachusetts and U.S. Ambassador to New Zealand , Scott P. Brown , was named the new president and dean of the school.

[ 21 ] Brown resigned in August 2021, citing a difference of vision from that of the board of directors.

[ 22 ] In January 2022, The Board of Trustees of New England Law Boston selected long-time professor Lisa R. Freudenheim [ 23 ] to lead the law school as its next dean.
