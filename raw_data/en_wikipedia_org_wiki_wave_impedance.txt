For a transverse-electric-magnetic ( TEM ) plane wave traveling through a homogeneous medium , the wave impedance is everywhere equal to the intrinsic impedance of the medium. In particular, for a plane wave travelling through empty space, the wave impedance is equal to the impedance of free space . The symbol Z is used to represent it and it is expressed in units of ohms . The symbol η ( eta ) may be used instead of Z for wave impedance to avoid confusion with electrical impedance .

Definition [ edit ] To avoid reflections, the impedance of two media must match. On the other hand, even if the real part of the refractive index is the same, but one has a large absorption coefficient, the impedance mismatch will make the interface highly reflective.

The wave impedance is given by Z = E 0 − − ( x ) H 0 − − ( x ) {\displaystyle Z={E_{0}^{-}(x) \over H_{0}^{-}(x)}} where E 0 − − ( x ) {\displaystyle E_{0}^{-}(x)} is the electric field and H 0 − − ( x ) {\displaystyle H_{0}^{-}(x)} is the magnetic field, in phasor representation. The impedance is, in general, a complex number .

In terms of the parameters of an electromagnetic wave and the medium it travels through, the wave impedance is given by Z = j ω ω μ μ σ σ + j ω ω ε ε {\displaystyle Z={\sqrt {j\omega \mu  \over \sigma +j\omega \varepsilon }}} where μ is the magnetic permeability , ε is the (real) electric permittivity and σ is the electrical conductivity of the material the wave is travelling through (corresponding to the imaginary component of the permittivity multiplied by omega). In the equation, j is the imaginary unit , and ω is the angular frequency of the wave. Just as for electrical impedance , the impedance is a function of frequency. In the case of an ideal dielectric (where the conductivity is zero), the equation reduces to the real number Z = μ μ ε ε .

{\displaystyle Z={\sqrt {\mu  \over \varepsilon }}.} In free space [ edit ] Main article: Impedance of free space In free space the wave impedance of plane waves is: Z 0 = μ μ 0 ε ε 0 {\displaystyle Z_{0}={\sqrt {\frac {\mu _{0}}{\varepsilon _{0}}}}} (where ε 0 is the permittivity constant in free space and μ 0 is the permeability constant in free space). Now, since c 0 = 1 μ μ 0 ε ε 0 = 299 792 458 m/s {\displaystyle c_{0}={\frac {1}{\sqrt {\mu _{0}\varepsilon _{0}}}}=299\,792\,458{\text{ m/s}}} (by definition of the metre ), Z 0 = μ μ 0 c 0 = 1 ε ε 0 c 0 {\displaystyle Z_{0}=\mu _{0}c_{0}={\frac {1}{\varepsilon _{0}c_{0}}}} .

The currently accepted value of Z 0 {\displaystyle Z_{0}} is 376.730 313 412 (59) Ω .

[ 1 ] In an unbounded dielectric [ edit ] In an isotropic , homogeneous dielectric with negligible magnetic properties, i.e.

μ μ = μ μ 0 {\displaystyle \mu =\mu _{0}} and ε ε = ε ε r ε ε 0 {\displaystyle \varepsilon =\varepsilon _{r}\varepsilon _{0}} . So, the value of wave impedance in a perfect dielectric is Z = μ μ ε ε = μ μ 0 ε ε 0 ε ε r = Z 0 ε ε r ≈ ≈ 377 ε ε r Ω Ω {\displaystyle Z={\sqrt {\mu  \over \varepsilon }}={\sqrt {\mu _{0} \over \varepsilon _{0}\varepsilon _{r}}}={Z_{0} \over {\sqrt {\varepsilon _{r}}}}\approx {377 \over {\sqrt {\varepsilon _{r}}}}\,\Omega } , where ε ε r {\displaystyle \varepsilon _{r}} is the relative dielectric constant .

In a waveguide [ edit ] For any waveguide in the form of a hollow metal tube, (such as rectangular guide, circular guide, or double-ridge guide), the wave impedance of a travelling wave is dependent on the frequency f {\displaystyle f} , but is the same throughout the guide. For transverse electric ( TE ) modes of propagation the wave impedance is: [ 2 ] Z = Z 0 1 − − ( f c f ) 2 (TE modes) , {\displaystyle Z={\frac {Z_{0}}{\sqrt {1-\left({\frac {f_{c}}{f}}\right)^{2}}}}\qquad {\mbox{(TE modes)}},} where f c is the cut-off frequency of the mode, and for transverse magnetic ( TM ) modes of propagation the wave impedance is: [ 2 ] Z = Z 0 1 − − ( f c f ) 2 (TM modes) {\displaystyle Z=Z_{0}{\sqrt {1-\left({\frac {f_{c}}{f}}\right)^{2}}}\qquad {\mbox{(TM modes)}}} Above the cut-off ( f > f c ), the impedance is real (resistive) and the wave carries energy. Below cut-off the impedance is imaginary (reactive) and the wave is evanescent . These expressions neglect the effect of resistive loss in the walls of the waveguide. For a waveguide entirely filled with a homogeneous dielectric medium, similar expressions apply, but with the wave impedance of the medium replacing Z 0 . The presence of the dielectric also modifies the cut-off frequency f c .

For a waveguide or transmission line containing more than one type of dielectric medium (such as microstrip ), the wave impedance will in general vary over the cross-section of the line.
