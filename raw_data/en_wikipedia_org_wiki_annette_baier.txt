She was well known also for her contributions to feminist philosophy and to the philosophy of mind, where she was strongly influenced by her former colleague, Wilfrid Sellars .

Biography [ edit ] Baier earned bachelor's and master's degrees at the University of Otago in her native Dunedin , New Zealand . In 1952 she went to Somerville College, Oxford , where she earned her PhD and met fellow philosophers Philippa Foot and G.E.M. Anscombe . For most of her career she taught in the philosophy department at the University of Pittsburgh , having moved there from Carnegie Mellon University . She retired to Dunedin.

She was former President of the Eastern Division of the American Philosophical Association , an office reserved for the elite of her profession. Baier received an honorary Doctor of Literature from the University of Otago in 1999.

Her husband was the philosopher Kurt Baier .

Ethics [ edit ] Baier's approach to ethics is that women and men make their decisions about right and wrong based on different value systems: men take their moral decisions according to an idea of justice , while women are motivated by a sense of trust or caring . The history of philosophy having been overwhelmingly compiled by men, she suggests, leads to a body of thought which apparently ignores the role of nurture and trust in human philosophy.
