[ 1 ] those that determine the response of a structure to a given action, e.g. testing of composite beams, aircraft structures to destruction, etc.

Mechanical testing of materials [ edit ] Tensile test. A standard specimen is subjected to a gradually increasing load (force) until failure occurs. The resultant load-displacement behaviour is used to determine a stress–strain curve , from which a number of mechanical properties can be measured.

There exists a large number of tests, many of which are standardized, to determine the various mechanical properties of materials. In general, such tests set out to obtain geometry-independent properties; i.e. those intrinsic to the bulk material. In practice this is not always feasible, since even in tensile tests, certain properties can be influenced by specimen size and/or geometry. Here is a listing of some of the most common tests: [ 2 ] Hardness Testing Vickers hardness test (HV), which has one of the widest scales Brinell hardness test (HB) Knoop hardness test (HK), for measurement over small areas Janka hardness test , for wood Meyer hardness test Rockwell hardness test (HR), principally used in the USA Shore durometer hardness, used for polymers Barcol hardness test , for composite materials Tensile testing , used to obtain the stress-strain curve for a material, and from there, properties such as Young modulus, yield (or proof) stress, tensile stress and % elongation to failure.

Impact testing Izod test Charpy test Fracture toughness testing Linear-elastic (K Ic ) K–R curve Elastic plastic (J Ic , CTOD) Creep Testing , for the mechanical behaviour of materials at high temperatures (relative to their melting point) Fatigue Testing , for the behaviour of materials under cyclic loading Load-controlled smooth specimen tests Strain-controlled smooth specimen tests Fatigue crack growth testing Non-Destructive Testing References [ edit ] ^ Siri, Saeed; Maier, Franz; Chen, Longtu; Santos, Stephany; Pierce, David M.; Feng, Bin (2019).
