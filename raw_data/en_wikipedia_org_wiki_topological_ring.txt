This means R {\displaystyle R} is an additive topological group and a multiplicative topological semigroup .

Topological rings are fundamentally related to topological fields and arise naturally while studying them, since for example the completion of a topological field may be a topological ring which is not a field .

[ 2 ] General comments [ edit ] The group of units R × × {\displaystyle R^{\times }} of a topological ring R {\displaystyle R} is a topological group when endowed with the topology coming from the embedding of R × × {\displaystyle R^{\times }} into the product R × × R {\displaystyle R\times R} as ( x , x − − 1 ) .

{\displaystyle \left(x,x^{-1}\right).} However, if the unit group is endowed with the subspace topology as a subspace of R , {\displaystyle R,} it may not be a topological group, because inversion on R × × {\displaystyle R^{\times }} need not be continuous with respect to the subspace topology. An example of this situation is the adele ring of a global field ; its unit group, called the idele group , is not a topological group in the subspace topology. If inversion on R × × {\displaystyle R^{\times }} is continuous in the subspace topology of R {\displaystyle R} then these two topologies on R × × {\displaystyle R^{\times }} are the same.

If one does not require a ring to have a unit, then one has to add the requirement of continuity of the additive inverse, or equivalently, to define the topological ring as a ring that is a topological group (with respect to addition) in which multiplication is continuous, too.

Examples [ edit ] Topological rings occur in mathematical analysis , for example as rings of continuous real-valued functions on some topological space (where the topology is given by pointwise convergence), or as rings of continuous linear operators on some normed vector space ; all Banach algebras are topological rings. The rational , real , complex and p {\displaystyle p} -adic numbers are also topological rings (even topological fields, see below) with their standard topologies. In the plane, split-complex numbers and dual numbers form alternative topological rings. See hypercomplex numbers for other low-dimensional examples.

In commutative algebra , the following construction is common: given an ideal I {\displaystyle I} in a commutative ring R , {\displaystyle R,} the I -adic topology on R {\displaystyle R} is defined as follows: a subset U {\displaystyle U} of R {\displaystyle R} is open if and only if for every x ∈ ∈ U {\displaystyle x\in U} there exists a natural number n {\displaystyle n} such that x + I n ⊆ ⊆ U .

{\displaystyle x+I^{n}\subseteq U.} This turns R {\displaystyle R} into a topological ring.  The I {\displaystyle I} -adic topology is Hausdorff if and only if the intersection of all powers of I {\displaystyle I} is the zero ideal ( 0 ) .

{\displaystyle (0).} The p {\displaystyle p} -adic topology on the integers is an example of an I {\displaystyle I} -adic topology (with I = p Z {\displaystyle I=p\mathbb {Z} } ).

Completion [ edit ] Main article: Completion (algebra) Every topological ring is a topological group (with respect to addition) and hence a uniform space in a natural manner. One can thus ask whether a given topological ring R {\displaystyle R} is complete . If it is not, then it can be completed : one can find an essentially unique complete topological ring S {\displaystyle S} that contains R {\displaystyle R} as a dense subring such that the given topology on R {\displaystyle R} equals the subspace topology arising from S .

{\displaystyle S.} If the starting ring R {\displaystyle R} is metric, the ring S {\displaystyle S} can be constructed as a set of equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences in R , {\displaystyle R,} this equivalence relation makes the ring S {\displaystyle S} Hausdorff and using constant sequences (which are Cauchy) one realizes a (uniformly) continuous morphism (CM in the sequel) c : R → → S {\displaystyle c:R\to S} such that, for all CM f : R → → T {\displaystyle f:R\to T} where T {\displaystyle T} is Hausdorff and complete, there exists a unique CM g : S → → T {\displaystyle g:S\to T} such that f = g ∘ ∘ c .

{\displaystyle f=g\circ c.} If R {\displaystyle R} is not metric (as, for instance, the ring of all real-variable rational valued functions, that is, all functions f : R → → Q {\displaystyle f:\mathbb {R} \to \mathbb {Q} } endowed with the topology of pointwise convergence) the standard construction uses minimal Cauchy filters and satisfies the same universal property as above (see Bourbaki , General Topology, III.6.5).

The rings of formal power series and the p {\displaystyle p} -adic integers are most naturally defined as completions of certain topological rings carrying I {\displaystyle I} -adic topologies .

Topological fields [ edit ] Some of the most important examples are topological fields . A topological field is a topological ring that is also a field , and such that inversion of non zero elements is a continuous function. The most common examples are the complex numbers and all its subfields , and the valued fields , which include the p {\displaystyle p} -adic fields .
