It comprises England , Scotland , Wales and Northern Ireland .

[ n ] The UK includes the island of Great Britain , the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland , and most of the smaller islands within the British Isles , covering 94,354 square miles (244,376 km 2 ).

[ f ] Northern Ireland shares a land border with the Republic of Ireland ; otherwise, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean , the North Sea , the English Channel , the Celtic Sea and the Irish Sea . It maintains sovereignty over the British Overseas Territories , which are located across various oceans and seas globally. The UK had an estimated population of over 68.2 million people in 2023. The capital and largest city of both England and the UK is London . The cities of Edinburgh , Cardiff and Belfast are the national capitals of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland respectively.

The UK has been inhabited continuously since the Neolithic . In AD 43 the Roman conquest of Britain began; the Roman departure was followed by Anglo-Saxon settlement . In 1066 the Normans conquered England . With the end of the Wars of the Roses the Kingdom of England stabilised and began to grow in power, resulting by the 16th century in the annexation of Wales and the establishment of the British Empire . Over the course of the 17th century the role of the British monarchy was reduced, particularly as a result of the English Civil War . In 1707 the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland united under the Treaty of Union to create the Kingdom of Great Britain . In the Georgian era the office of prime minister became established. The Acts of Union 1800 incorporated the Kingdom of Ireland to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in 1801. Most of Ireland seceded from the UK in 1922 as the Irish Free State , and the Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927 created the present United Kingdom.

The UK became the first industrialised country and was the world's foremost power for the majority of the 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly during the Pax Britannica between 1815 and 1914. The British Empire was the leading economic power for most of the 19th century, a position supported by its agricultural prosperity , its role as a dominant trading nation , a massive industrial capacity, significant technological achievements , and the rise of 19th-century London as the world's principal financial centre. At its height in the 1920s the empire encompassed almost a quarter of the world's landmass and population, and was the largest empire in history . However, its involvement in the First World War and the Second World War damaged Britain's economic power , and a global wave of decolonisation led to the independence of most British colonies.

The UK is a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary democracy [ o ] with three distinct jurisdictions: England and Wales , Scotland , and Northern Ireland . Since 1999 Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have their own governments and parliaments which control various devolved matters. A developed country with an advanced economy , the UK ranks amongst the largest economies by nominal GDP and is one of the world's largest exporters and importers . As a nuclear state with one of the highest defence budgets , the UK maintains one of the strongest militaries in Europe .

Its soft power influence can be observed in the legal and political systems of many of its former colonies , and British culture remains globally influential, particularly in language , literature , music and sport . A great power , the UK is part of numerous international organisations and forums .

Etymology and terminology See also: Britain (place name) and Terminology of the British Isles The Acts of Union 1707 declared that the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland were "United into One Kingdom by the Name of Great Britain".

[ p ] [ 22 ] The term "United Kingdom" has occasionally been used as a description for the former Kingdom of Great Britain , although its official name from 1707 to 1800 was simply "Great Britain".

[ 23 ] The Acts of Union 1800 formed the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland . Following the partition of Ireland and the independence of the Irish Free State in 1922, which left Northern Ireland as the only part of the island of Ireland within the United Kingdom, the name was changed in 1927 to the "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland".

[ 24 ] Although the United Kingdom is a sovereign country, England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are also widely referred to as countries .

[ 25 ] The UK Prime Minister's website has used the phrase "countries within a country" to describe it.

[ 26 ] Some statistical summaries, such as those for the twelve NUTS 1 regions , refer to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland as "regions".

[ 27 ] Northern Ireland is also referred to as a "province".

[ 28 ] With regard to Northern Ireland, the descriptive name used "can be controversial, with the choice often revealing one's political preferences".

[ 29 ] The term "Great Britain" conventionally refers to the island of Great Britain, or politically to England, Scotland and Wales in combination.

[ 30 ] It is sometimes used as a loose synonym for the United Kingdom as a whole.

[ 31 ] The word England is occasionally used incorrectly to refer to the United Kingdom as a whole, a mistake principally made by people from outside the UK.

[ 32 ] The term "Britain" is used as a synonym for Great Britain , [ 33 ] [ 34 ] but also sometimes for the United Kingdom.

[ 35 ] [ 34 ] Usage is mixed: the UK Government style guide prefers the term "UK" rather than "Britain" or "British" (except when referring to embassies [ q ] ), [ 37 ] while other government documents acknowledge that both terms refer to the United Kingdom and that elsewhere "British government" is used at least as frequently as "United Kingdom government".

[ 38 ] The UK Permanent Committee on Geographical Names recognises "United Kingdom", "UK" and "U.K." as shortened and abbreviated geopolitical terms for the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in its toponymic guidelines; it does not list "Britain" but notes that "it is only the one specific nominal term 'Great Britain' which invariably excludes Northern Ireland".

[ 38 ] The BBC historically preferred to use "Britain" as shorthand only for Great Britain, though the present style guide does not take a position except that "Great Britain" excludes Northern Ireland.

[ 39 ] The adjective "British" is commonly used to refer to matters relating to the United Kingdom and is used in law to refer to United Kingdom citizenship and nationality .

[ 40 ] [ r ] People of the United Kingdom use several different terms to describe their national identity and may identify themselves as being British , English , Scottish , Welsh , Northern Irish or Irish ; [ 43 ] or as having a combination of different national identities.

[ 44 ] History Main articles: Formation of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and History of the British Isles Further information: History of the constitution of the United Kingdom and Timeline of British history Prior to the Treaty of Union Main articles: History of England , History of Wales , History of Scotland , and History of Ireland Further information: Kingdom of England and Kingdom of Scotland Stonehenge in Wiltshire is a ring of stones, each about 4 m (13 ft) high, 2 m (7 ft) wide and 25 tonnes , erected 2400–2200 BC.

Settlement by Cro-Magnons of what was to become the United Kingdom occurred in waves beginning by about 30,000 years ago.

[ 45 ] The island has been continuously inhabited only since the last retreat of the ice around 11,500 years ago.

[ 46 ] By the end of the region's prehistoric period , the population is thought to have belonged largely to a culture termed Insular Celtic , comprising Brittonic Britain and Gaelic Ireland .

[ 47 ] The Roman conquest , beginning in AD 43, and the 400-year rule of southern Britain , was followed by an invasion by Germanic Anglo-Saxon settlers, reducing the Brittonic area mainly to what was to become Wales , Cornwall and, until the latter stages of the Anglo-Saxon settlement, the Hen Ogledd (northern England and parts of southern Scotland).

[ 48 ] Most of the region settled by the Anglo-Saxons became unified as the Kingdom of England in the 10th century.

[ 49 ] Meanwhile, Gaelic speakers in north-west Britain (with connections to the north-east of Ireland and traditionally supposed to have migrated from there in the 5th century) [ 50 ] united with the Picts to create the Kingdom of Scotland in the 9th century.

[ 51 ] The Roman Baths in Bath, Somerset , are a well-preserved thermae from Roman Britain .

In 1066 the Normans invaded England from northern France. After conquering England they seized large parts of Wales , conquered much of Ireland and were invited to settle in Scotland, bringing to each country feudalism on the Northern French model and Norman-French culture.

[ 52 ] The Anglo-Norman ruling class greatly influenced, but eventually assimilated with, the local cultures.

[ 53 ] Subsequent medieval English kings completed the conquest of Wales and tried unsuccessfully to annex Scotland . Asserting its independence in the 1320 Declaration of Arbroath , Scotland maintained its independence thereafter, albeit in near-constant conflict with England .

[ 54 ] In 1215 Magna Carta was the first document to state that no government was above the law, that citizens have rights protecting them, and that they were entitled to a fair trial .

[ 55 ] The English monarchs, through inheritance of substantial territories in France and claims to the French crown, were also heavily involved in conflicts in France, most notably the Hundred Years' War , while the Kings of Scots were in an alliance with the French during this period.

[ 56 ] Early modern Britain saw religious conflict resulting from the Reformation and the introduction of Protestant state churches in each country.

[ 57 ] The English Reformation ushered in political, constitutional, social and cultural change in the 16th century and established the Church of England . Moreover, it defined a national identity for England and slowly, but profoundly, changed people's religious beliefs.

[ 58 ] Wales was fully incorporated into the Kingdom of England , [ 59 ] and Ireland was constituted as a kingdom in personal union with the English crown.

[ 60 ] In what was to become Northern Ireland, the lands of the independent Catholic Gaelic nobility were confiscated and given to Protestant settlers from England and Scotland.

[ 61 ] The Bayeux Tapestry depicts the Battle of Hastings , 1066, and the events leading to it.

In 1603 the kingdoms of England, Scotland and Ireland were united in a personal union when James VI of Scotland inherited the crowns of England and Ireland and moved his court from Edinburgh to London; each country nevertheless remained a separate political entity and retained its separate political, legal and religious institutions.

[ 62 ] In the mid-17th century, all three kingdoms were involved in a series of connected wars (including the English Civil War ) which led to the temporary overthrow of the monarchy, with the execution of King Charles I , and the establishment of the short-lived unitary republic of the Commonwealth of England , Scotland and Ireland.

[ 63 ] Although the monarchy was restored , the Interregnum along with the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and the subsequent Bill of Rights 1689 in England and Claim of Right Act 1689 in Scotland ensured that, unlike much of the rest of Europe, royal absolutism would not prevail, and a professed Catholic could never accede to the throne. The British constitution would develop on the basis of constitutional monarchy and the parliamentary system .

[ 64 ] With the founding of the Royal Society in 1660, science was greatly encouraged. During this period, particularly in England, the development of naval power and the interest in voyages of discovery led to the acquisition and settlement of overseas colonies , particularly in North America and the Caribbean.

[ 65 ] Though previous attempts at uniting the two kingdoms within Great Britain in 1606, 1667, and 1689 had proved unsuccessful, the attempt initiated in 1705 led to the Treaty of Union of 1706 being agreed and ratified by both parliaments.

Union of England and Scotland Main articles: Treaty of Union and Kingdom of Great Britain The Treaty of Union which unified the Kingdom of England and Kingdom of Scotland on 1 May 1707 On 1 May 1707 the Kingdom of Great Britain was formed, the result of the Acts of Union 1707 between the Kingdom of England and Kingdom of Scotland .

[ 66 ] In the 18th century cabinet government developed under Robert Walpole , in practice the first prime minister (1721–1742). A series of Jacobite uprisings sought to remove the Protestant House of Hanover from the throne and restore the Catholic House of Stuart . The Jacobites were finally defeated at the Battle of Culloden in 1746, after which the Scottish Highlanders were forcibly assimilated into Scotland by revoking the feudal independence of clan chiefs . The British colonies in North America that broke away in the American War of Independence became the United States . British imperial ambition turned towards Asia, particularly to India .

[ 67 ] British merchants played a leading part in the Atlantic slave trade , mainly between 1662 and 1807 when British or British-colonial slave ships transported nearly 3.3 million slaves from Africa.

[ 68 ] The slaves were taken to work on plantations , principally in the Caribbean but also in North America .

[ 69 ] However, with pressure from the abolitionist movement , Parliament banned the trade in 1807, banned slavery in the British Empire in 1833, and Britain took a leading role in the movement to abolish slavery worldwide through the blockade of Africa and pressing other nations to end their trade with a series of treaties.

[ 70 ] United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland Main articles: History of the United Kingdom , Acts of Union (1800) , and United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland Victoria reigned as Queen of the United Kingdom and Empress of India during the 19th century.

In 1800 the parliaments of Great Britain and Ireland each passed an Act of Union, uniting the two kingdoms and creating the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland on 1 January 1801.

[ 71 ] After the defeat of France at the end of the French Revolutionary Wars and Napoleonic Wars (1792–1815) the United Kingdom emerged as the principal naval and imperial power (with London the largest city in the world from about 1830 ).

[ 72 ] Unchallenged at sea , British dominance was later described as the Pax Britannica ("British Peace"), a period of relative peace amongst the great powers (1815–1914) during which the British Empire became the global hegemon and foremost power [ 73 ] [ 74 ] and adopted the role of global policeman .

[ 75 ] [ 76 ] From 1853 to 1856 Britain took part in the Crimean War , allied with the Ottoman Empire against Tsarist Russia , [ 77 ] participating in the naval battles of the Baltic Sea known as the Åland War in the Gulf of Bothnia and the Gulf of Finland , amongst others.

[ 78 ] Following the Indian Rebellion of 1857 the British government led by Lord Palmerston assumed direct rule over India . Alongside the formal control it exerted over its own colonies, British dominance of much of world trade meant that it effectively controlled the economies of regions such as East Asia and Latin America .

[ 79 ] Throughout the Victorian era (1837–1901) political attitudes favoured free trade and laissez-faire policies. Beginning with the Great Reform Act in 1832, Parliament gradually widened the voting franchise , with the 1884 Reform Act championed by William Gladstone granting suffrage to a majority of males for the first time. The British population increased at a dramatic rate, accompanied by rapid urbanisation , causing significant social and economic stresses.

[ 80 ] By the late 19th century the Conservative Party under Benjamin Disraeli and Lord Salisbury initiated a period of imperial expansion in Africa , maintained a policy of " splendid isolation " in Europe, and attempted to contain the influence of the Russian Empire in Afghanistan and Persia , in what came to be known as the Great Game .

[ 81 ] During this time Canada , Australia and New Zealand were granted self-governing dominion status.

[ 82 ] At the turn of the century, Britain's industrial dominance became challenged by the German Empire and the United States .

[ 83 ] The Edwardian era (1901–1910) included social reform and home rule for Ireland become important domestic issues, while the Labour Party emerged from an alliance of trade unions and small socialist groups in 1900, and suffragettes campaigned for women's right to vote.

[ 84 ] World wars and partition of Ireland Main articles: History of the United Kingdom during the First World War , Partition of Ireland , Interwar Britain , United Kingdom home front during the Second World War , and Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II Wreaths being laid during the Remembrance Sunday service at the Cenotaph in Whitehall , London Britain was one of the principal Allies that defeated the Central Powers in the First World War (1914–1918). Alongside their French, Russian and (after 1917) American counterparts, [ 85 ] British armed forces were engaged across much of the British Empire and in several regions of Europe, particularly on the Western Front .

[ 86 ] The high fatalities of trench warfare caused the loss of much of a generation of men, with lasting social effects in the nation and a great disruption in the social order. Britain had suffered 2.5 million casualties and finished the war with a huge national debt.

[ 86 ] The consequences of the war persuaded the government to expand the right to vote in national and local elections to all adult men and most adult women with the Representation of the People Act 1918 .

[ 86 ] After the war Britain became a permanent member of the Executive Council of the League of Nations and received a mandate over a number of former German and Ottoman colonies. Under the leadership of David Lloyd George , the British Empire reached its greatest extent, covering a fifth of the world's land surface and a quarter of its population.

[ 87 ] By the mid-1920s most of the British population could listen to BBC radio programmes.

[ 88 ] [ 89 ] Experimental television broadcasts began in 1929 and the first scheduled BBC Television Service commenced in 1936.

[ 90 ] The rise of Irish nationalism , and disputes within Ireland over the terms of Irish Home Rule , led eventually to the partition of the island in 1921.

[ 91 ] A period of conflict in what is now Northern Ireland occurred from June 1920 until June 1922. The Irish Free State became independent, initially with Dominion status in 1922, and unambiguously independent in 1931 . Northern Ireland remained part of the United Kingdom.

[ 92 ] The 1928 Equal Franchise Act gave women electoral equality with men in national elections. Strikes in the mid-1920s culminated in the General Strike of 1926 . Britain had still not recovered from the effects of the First World War when the Great Depression (1929–1932) led to considerable unemployment and hardship in the old industrial areas, as well as political and social unrest with rising membership in communist and socialist parties.

A coalition government was formed in 1931.

[ 93 ] Spitfire and Hurricane as flown in the Battle of Britain during the Second World War Nonetheless, "Britain was a very wealthy country, formidable in arms, ruthless in pursuit of its interests and sitting at the heart of a global production system." [ 94 ] After Nazi Germany invaded Poland in 1939, Britain entered the Second World War .

Winston Churchill became prime minister and head of a coalition government in 1940. Despite the defeat of its European allies in the first year, Britain and its Empire continued the war against Germany. Churchill engaged industry, scientists and engineers to support the government and the military in the prosecution of the war effort.

[ 94 ] In 1940 the Royal Air Force defeated the German Luftwaffe in the Battle of Britain . Urban areas suffered heavy bombing during the Blitz . The Grand Alliance of Britain, the United States and the Soviet Union formed in 1941, leading the Allies against the Axis powers . There were eventual hard-fought victories in the Battle of the Atlantic , the North Africa campaign and the Italian campaign . British forces played important roles in the Normandy landings of 1944 and the liberation of Europe . The British Army led the Burma campaign against Japan, and the British Pacific Fleet fought Japan at sea. British scientists contributed to the Manhattan Project whose task was to build a nuclear weapon .

[ 95 ] Once built, it was decided, with British consent, to use the weapon against Japan.

[ 96 ] Post-war 20th century Main articles: Post-war Britain (1945–1979) and Social history of post-war Britain (1945–1979) The British Empire at its territorial peak in 1921 The UK was one of the Big Three powers (along with the US and the Soviet Union) who met to plan the post-war world ; [ 97 ] it drafted the Declaration by United Nations with the United States and became one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council . It worked closely with the United States to establish the International Monetary Fund , the World Bank and NATO .

[ 98 ] The war left the UK severely weakened and financially dependent on the American Marshall Plan , [ 99 ] but it was spared the total war that devastated eastern Europe .

[ 100 ] In the immediate post-war years the Labour government under Clement Attlee initiated a radical programme of reforms, which significantly affected British society in the following decades .

[ 101 ] Major industries and public utilities were nationalised , a welfare state was established, and a comprehensive, publicly funded healthcare system, the National Health Service , was created.

[ 102 ] The rise of nationalism in the colonies coincided with Britain's much-diminished economic position after its involvement in the First World War and the Second World War , so that a policy of decolonisation was unavoidable.

[ 103 ] [ 104 ] [ 105 ] Independence was granted to India and Pakistan in 1947.

[ 106 ] Over the next three decades, most colonies of the British Empire gained their independence, and many became members of the Commonwealth of Nations .

[ 107 ] The UK was the third country to develop a nuclear weapons arsenal (with its first atomic bomb test, Operation Hurricane , in 1952), but the post-war limitations of Britain's international role were illustrated by the Suez Crisis of 1956. The international spread of the English language , the world's most-widely-spoken language and third-most-spoken native language , [ 108 ] ensured the continuing international influence of its literature and its culture .

[ 109 ] [ 110 ] As a result of a shortage of workers in the 1950s, the government encouraged immigration from Commonwealth countries . In the following decades the UK became a more multiracial and multicultural society.

[ 111 ] Despite rising living standards in the late 1950s and 1960s, the UK's economic performance was less successful than many of its main competitors such as France, West Germany and Japan. The UK was the first democratic nation to lower its voting age to 18 in 1969.

[ 112 ] In the decades-long process of European integration the UK was a founding member of the Western European Union , established with the London and Paris Conferences in 1954. In 1960 the UK was one of the seven founding members of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), but in 1973 it left to join the European Communities (EC).

From 1984 the British economy was helped by the inflow of substantial North Sea oil revenues.

[ 116 ] Another British Overseas Territory, Gibraltar , ceded to Great Britain in the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht, [ 117 ] is a key military base . A referendum in 2002 on shared sovereignty with Spain was rejected by 98.97 per cent of voters in Gibraltar.

[ 130 ] [ 131 ] [ 132 ] The UK was the first country in the world to use an approved COVID-19 vaccine , developing its own vaccine through a collaboration between the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca , which allowed the UK's vaccine rollout to be amongst the fastest in the world.

[ 133 ] [ 134 ] Geography Main articles: Geography of the United Kingdom , Fauna of Great Britain , and Flora of Great Britain and Ireland Satellite image of the United Kingdom (excluding Shetland ) The total area of the United Kingdom is approximately 94,354 square miles (244,376 km 2 ), [ f ] [ 12 ] with a land area of 93,723 square miles (242,741 km 2 ).

[ 12 ] It occupies the major part of the British Isles [ 135 ] archipelago and includes the island of Great Britain, the north-eastern one-sixth of the island of Ireland and some smaller surrounding islands , meaning it comprises England , Scotland , Wales and Northern Ireland .

[ 136 ] It lies between the North Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea with the southeast coast coming within 22 miles (35 km) of the coast of northern France, from which it is separated by the English Channel .

[ 140 ] The length of coastline of Great Britain plus its principal islands is about 19,491 miles (31,368 km) long, with the coastline of the main island Great Britain being 11,073 miles (17,820 km) of that, [ 141 ] though measurements can vary greatly due to the coastline paradox .

[ 142 ] It is connected to continental Europe by the Channel Tunnel , which at 31 miles (50 km) (24 miles (38 km) underwater) is the longest underwater tunnel in the world.

[ 143 ] The UK contains four terrestrial ecoregions : Celtic broadleaf forests , English Lowlands beech forests , North Atlantic moist mixed forests , and Caledonian conifer forests .

[ 144 ] The area of woodland in the UK in 2023 was estimated to be 3.25 million hectares, which represents 13 per cent of the UK's land area.

[ 145 ] Climate Main articles: Climate of the United Kingdom and Climate change in the United Kingdom Further information: Climate of England , Climate of Scotland , Climate of Northern Ireland , and Climate of Wales Most of the United Kingdom has a temperate climate, with generally cool temperatures and plentiful rainfall all year round.

[ 137 ] The temperature varies with the seasons seldom dropping below 0 °C (32 °F ) or rising above 30 °C (86 °F).

[ 146 ] Some parts, away from the coast, of upland England, Wales, Northern Ireland and most of Scotland, experience a subpolar oceanic climate . Higher elevations in Scotland experience a continental subarctic climate and the mountains experience a tundra climate .

[ 147 ] The prevailing wind is from the southwest and bears frequent spells of mild and wet weather from the Atlantic Ocean, [ 137 ] although the eastern parts are mostly sheltered from this wind. Since the majority of the rain falls over the western regions, the eastern parts are the driest. Atlantic currents, warmed by the Gulf Stream , bring mild winters, especially in the west where winters are wet and even more so over high ground. Summers are warmest in the southeast of England and coolest in the north. Heavy snowfall can occur in winter and early spring on high ground, and occasionally settles to great depth away from the hills.

[ 148 ] The average total annual sunshine in the United Kingdom was 1,339.7 hours between 1971 and 2000, [ 149 ] which is just under 30% of the maximum possible.

[ citation needed ] The hours of sunshine vary from 1,200 to about 1,580 hours per year, and since 1996 the UK has been receiving above the 1,981 to 2,010 average hours of sunshine.

[ 154 ] Most of the country consists of lowland terrain, [ 155 ] with upland and mountainous terrain northwest of the Tees–Exe line which roughly divides the UK into lowland and upland areas.

Lowland areas include Cornwall , the New Forest , the South Downs and the Norfolk Broads . Upland areas include the Lake District , the Pennines , the Yorkshire Dales , Exmoor and Dartmoor . The main rivers and estuaries are the Thames , Severn , and the Humber . England's highest mountain is Scafell Pike , at 978 metres (3,209 ft) in the Lake District; its largest island is the Isle of Wight .

Scotland accounts for 32 per cent of the UK, covering 30,410 square miles (78,772 km 2 ).

[ 156 ] This includes nearly 800 islands , [ 157 ] notably the Hebrides , Orkney Islands and Shetland Islands. Scotland is the most mountainous constituent country of the UK. The Highlands to the north and west are the more rugged region containing the majority of Scotland's mountainous land, including the Cairngorms , Loch Lomond and The Trossachs and Ben Nevis which at 1,345 metres (4,413 ft) [ 158 ] is the highest point in the British Isles.

[ 159 ] Wales accounts for less than 9 per cent of the UK, covering 8,020 square miles (20,779 km 2 ).

[ 160 ] It is mostly mountainous, though South Wales is less mountainous than North and mid Wales . The highest mountains in Wales are in Snowdonia and include Snowdon ( Welsh : Yr Wyddfa ) which, at 1,085 metres (3,560 ft), is the highest peak in Wales.

It includes Lough Neagh which, at 150 square miles (388 km 2 ), is the largest lake in the British Isles by area, [ 161 ] Lough Erne , which has over 150 islands, and the Giant's Causeway , which is listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site . The highest peak in Northern Ireland is Slieve Donard in the Mourne Mountains at 852 metres (2,795 ft).

[ 155 ] Politics Main articles: Politics of the United Kingdom , Government of the United Kingdom , and Monarchy of the United Kingdom Further information: Constitution of the United Kingdom Charles III , king since 2022 Keir Starmer , prime minister since 2024 The UK is a constitutional monarchy and a parliamentary democracy [ 162 ] operating under the Westminster system , otherwise known as a "democratic parliamentary monarchy".

[ 163 ] It is a centralised , unitary state [ 164 ] [ 165 ] wherein the Parliament of the United Kingdom is sovereign .

[ 166 ] Parliament is made up of the elected House of Commons , the appointed House of Lords and the Crown (as personified by the monarch ).

[ s ] [ 169 ] The main business of parliament takes place in the two houses, [ 169 ] but royal assent is required for a bill to become an act of Parliament (that is, statute law ).

[ 170 ] As a result of parliamentary sovereignty, the British constitution is uncodified , consisting mostly of disparate written sources, including parliamentary statutes , judge-made case law and international treaties, together with constitutional conventions .

[ 171 ] Nevertheless, the Supreme Court recognises a number of principles underlying the British constitution, such as parliamentary sovereignty , the rule of law , democracy and upholding international law .

[ 172 ] King Charles III is the monarch and head of state of the UK and of 14 other independent sovereign states . These 15 countries are referred to as " Commonwealth realms ". The monarch is formally vested with all executive authority as the personal embodiment of the Crown and is "fundamental to the law and working of government in the UK".

[ 173 ] The disposition of such powers however, including those belonging to the royal prerogative , is generally exercised only on the advice of ministers of the Crown responsible to Parliament and thence to the electorate. Nevertheless, in the performance of official duties the monarch has "the right to be consulted, the right to encourage, and the right to warn".

[ 174 ] In addition the monarch has a number of reserve powers at his disposal to uphold responsible government and prevent constitutional crises .

[ t ] For general elections (elections to the House of Commons), the UK is divided into 650 constituencies , each of which is represented by one member of Parliament (MP) elected by the first-past-the-post system.

[ 176 ] MPs hold office for up to five years and must then stand for re-election if they wish to continue to be an MP.

[ 176 ] The Conservative Party , colloquially known as the Tory Party or the Tories, and the Labour Party have been the dominant political parties in the UK since the 1920s, leading to the UK being described as a two-party system . However, since the 1920s other political parties have won seats in the House of Commons, although never more than the Conservatives or Labour.

[ 177 ] The Palace of Westminster in London is the seat of both houses of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.

The prime minister is the head of government in the UK.

[ 178 ] Acting under the direction and supervision of a Cabinet of senior ministers selected and led by the prime minister, His Majesty's Government serves as the principal instrument for public policymaking, administers public services and, through the Privy Council , promulgates statutory instruments and tenders advice to the monarch.

[ 179 ] [ 180 ] [ 181 ] Nearly all prime ministers have served concurrently as First Lord of the Treasury [ 182 ] and all prime ministers have continuously served as First Lord of the Treasury since 1905, [ 183 ] Minister for the Civil Service since 1968, [ 184 ] and Minister for the Union since 2019.

[ 185 ] While appointed by the monarch, in modern times the prime minister is, by convention , an MP, the leader of the political party with the most seats in the House of Commons, and holds office by virtue of their ability to command the confidence of the House of Commons.

[ 186 ] [ 187 ] [ 188 ] The prime minister as of 5 July 2024 is Sir Keir Starmer , the leader of the Labour Party .

Although not part of the United Kingdom, the three Crown Dependencies of Jersey , Guernsey and the Isle of Man , as well as the 14 British Overseas Territories , are subject to the sovereignty of the British Crown. The Crown exercises its responsibilities in relation to the Crown Dependencies mainly through the British government's Home Office and for the British Overseas Territories principally through the Foreign Office .

[ 189 ] Administrative divisions Main articles: Countries of the United Kingdom , Administrative geography of the United Kingdom , and List of counties in the United Kingdom The four countries of the United Kingdom The geographical division of the United Kingdom into counties or shires began in England and Scotland in the early Middle Ages , and was completed throughout Great Britain and Ireland by the early modern period .

[ 190 ] Modern local government by elected councils, partly based on the ancient counties, was established by separate Acts of Parliament: in England and Wales in 1888 , Scotland in 1889 and Ireland in 1898 , meaning there is no consistent system of administrative or geographic demarcation across the UK, [ 191 ] and England and Wales , Scotland and Northern Ireland each have their own distinct jurisdictions.

[ 192 ] Until the 19th century there was little change to those arrangements, but there has since been a constant evolution of role and function.

[ 193 ] Local government in England is complex, with the distribution of functions varying according to local arrangements. The upper-tier subdivisions of England are the nine regions , used primarily for statistical purposes.

[ 194 ] One of the regions, Greater London , has had a directly elected assembly and mayor since 2000 following popular support for the proposal in a 1998 referendum .

[ 195 ] Local government in Scotland is divided into 32 council areas with a wide variation in size and population. The cities of Glasgow , Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee are separate council areas, as is the Highland Council , which includes a third of Scotland's area but only just over 200,000 people. Local councils are made up of elected councillors, of whom there are 1,223.

[ 196 ] Local government in Wales consists of 22 unitary authorities , each led by a leader and cabinet elected by the council itself. These include the cities of Cardiff, Swansea and Newport , which are unitary authorities in their own right.

[ 197 ] Elections are held every four years under the first-past-the-post system.

[ 197 ] Local government in Northern Ireland since 1973 has been organised into 26 district councils, each elected by single transferable vote. Their powers are limited to services such as waste collection, dog control, and maintaining parks and cemeteries.

[ 198 ] In 2008 the executive agreed on proposals to create 11 new councils to replace the existing system.

[ 199 ] Devolution Main article: Devolution in the United Kingdom Further information: Devolved, reserved and excepted matters Prime Minister Starmer meets with the first ministers of Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales during the Council of Nations and Regions summit.

In the United Kingdom a process of devolution has transferred various powers from the UK Government to three of the four UK countries—Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales—as well as to the regions of England, which since 1999 have their own governments and parliaments which control various devolved matters.

[ 200 ] These powers vary and have been moved to the Scottish Government , the Welsh Government , the Northern Ireland Executive and in England, the Greater London Authority , Combined Authorities and Combined County Authorities .

[ 201 ] Amongst the devolved parliaments across the United Kingdom, the Scottish Parliament has the most extensive responsibilities for devolved powers , and has been described as "one of the most powerful devolved parliaments in the world".

[ 202 ] [ 203 ] The UK has an uncodified constitution and constitutional matters are not amongst the powers that have been devolved. Under the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty , the UK Parliament could, in theory, therefore, abolish the Scottish Parliament, Senedd or Northern Ireland Assembly.

[ 204 ] Though in the Scotland Act 2016 and the Wales Act 2017 it states that the Scottish Government and the Welsh Government "are a permanent part of the United Kingdom's constitutional arrangements".

[ 205 ] [ 206 ] In practice it would be politically difficult for the UK Parliament to abolish devolution to the Scottish Parliament and the Senedd, because these institutions were created by referendums.

[ 207 ] The political constraints placed upon the UK Parliament's power to interfere with devolution in Northern Ireland are greater still, because devolution in Northern Ireland rests upon an international agreement with the Government of Ireland .

[ 208 ] The UK Parliament restricts the three devolved parliaments' legislative powers in economic policy matters through an act passed in 2020.

[ 209 ] England Unlike Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, England does not have a separate devolved government or national parliament, [ 210 ] rather a process of devolution of powers from the central government to local authorities has taken place, first in 1998.

[ 211 ] The Greater London Authority (GLA) was set up following a referendum in 1998 . Colloquially known as City Hall, it is the devolved regional government body for Greater London. It consists of two political branches: an Executive Mayor and the London Assembly , which serves as a check and balance on the Mayor.

A Combined Authority (CA) is a type of local government institution introduced in England outside Greater London by the Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Act 2009 . CAs allow a group of local authorities to pool appropriate responsibility and receive certain devolved functions from central government in order to deliver transport and economic policy more effectively over a wider area.

[ 212 ] A Combined County Authority (CCA) is a similar type of local-government institution introduced in England outside Greater London by the Levelling-up and Regeneration Act 2023 , but may only be formed by upper-tier authorities: county councils and unitary authorities .

[ 213 ] Scotland Main article: Responsibilities of the Scottish Government Prime Minister Keir Starmer meets with First Minister of Scotland John Swinney , the head of the Scottish Government , at Bute House , Edinburgh.

Since 1999 Scotland has had a devolved national government and parliament with wide-ranging powers over any matter that has not been specifically reserved to the UK Parliament.

[ 214 ] [ 215 ] Scotland has the most devolved powers of any of the three devolved parliaments in the United Kingdom, with full legislative control over education , law and order , the economy , healthcare , elections , Crown Estate Scotland , the planning system and housing .

[ 216 ] Additional powers were transferred to the Scottish Parliament via the Scotland Act 2012 and the Scotland Act 2016 , such as some taxation powers , including full control of income tax on income earned through employment, Land and Buildings Transaction Tax , Landfill Tax , Aggregates Levy, Air Departure Tax and Revenue Scotland , as well as aspects of the energy network , including renewable energy , energy efficiency and onshore oil and gas licensing .

[ 217 ] [ 218 ] Their power over economic issues is significantly constrained by an act of the UK Parliament passed in 2020.

[ 209 ] The Scottish Government is a Scottish National Party (SNP) minority government , [ 226 ] led by the first minister , currently John Swinney , the leader of the SNP . In 2014 the Scottish independence referendum was held, with 55.3 per cent voting against independence from the United Kingdom and 44.7 per cent voting in favour, resulting in Scotland staying within the United Kingdom.

Local government in Scotland is divided into 32 council areas with a wide variation in size and population. Local councils are made up of elected councillors, of whom there are 1,223.

[ 196 ] The Scottish Parliament is separate from the Scottish Government. It is made up of 129 elected members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs). It is the law-making body of Scotland, and thus it scrutinises the work of the incumbent Scottish Government and considers any piece of proposed legislation through parliamentary debates, committees and parliamentary questions.

[ 227 ] Wales Since 1999 Wales has had a devolved national government and legislature, known as the Senedd. Elections to the Senedd use the additional member system . It has more limited powers than those devolved to Scotland.

[ 228 ] The Senedd can legislate on any matter not specifically reserved to the UK Parliament by Acts of Senedd Cymru . The Welsh Government is currently a Welsh Labour minority government led by the first minister , Eluned Morgan .

Local government in Wales consists of 22 unitary authorities, each led by a leader and cabinet elected by the council itself.

Northern Ireland The devolved form of government in Northern Ireland is based on the 1998 Good Friday Agreement , which brought to an end a 30-year period of unionist - nationalist communal conflict known as the Troubles . The Agreement was confirmed by referendum and implemented later that year. It established power sharing arrangements for a devolved government and legislature, referred to as the Northern Ireland Executive and the Northern Ireland Assembly respectively.

[ 229 ] Elections to the Assembly use the single transferable vote system. The Executive and Assembly have powers similar to those devolved to Scotland.

[ 230 ] The Executive is led by a diarchy representing unionist and nationalist members of the Assembly.

[ 231 ] The first minister and deputy first minister of Northern Ireland are the joint heads of government of Northern Ireland.

[ 232 ] [ 233 ] Local government in Northern Ireland since 2015 has been divided between 11 councils with limited responsibilities.

[ 198 ] Foreign relations Main article: Foreign relations of the United Kingdom UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and US President Donald Trump shaking hands in a joint press conference in 2025. The UK and the United States share a " Special Relationship ".

The UK is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council , a member of NATO , AUKUS , the Commonwealth of Nations , the G7 , the G20 , the OECD , the WTO , the Council of Europe and the OSCE .

[ 234 ] The country maintains the British Council , a British organisation in over 100 countries specialising in international cultural and educational opportunities. The UK remains a great power with considerable political, cultural, economic and military influence.

[ 235 ] [ 236 ] The UK is said to have a " Special Relationship " with the United States and a close partnership with France – the " Entente cordiale " – and shares nuclear weapons technology with both countries; [ 237 ] [ 238 ] the Anglo-Portuguese Alliance is considered to be the oldest binding military alliance in the world. The UK is also closely linked with the Republic of Ireland; the two countries share a Common Travel Area and co-operate through the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference and the British-Irish Council . Britain's global presence and influence is further amplified through its trading relations, foreign investments, official development assistance and military engagements.

[ 239 ] Canada, Australia and New Zealand, all of which are former colonies of the British Empire which share King Charles III as their head of state, are the most favourably viewed countries in the world by British people .

[ 240 ] Law and criminal justice Main articles: Law of the United Kingdom , Censorship in the United Kingdom , and Crime in the United Kingdom Further information: English law , Northern Ireland law , and Scots law The Supreme Court is the final court of appeal for England, Wales, Northern Ireland and for Scottish civil cases.

The United Kingdom does not have a single legal system as Article 19 of the 1706 Treaty of Union provided for the continuation of Scotland's separate legal system.

[ 241 ] The UK has three distinct systems of law : English law, Northern Ireland law and Scots law. A new Supreme Court of the United Kingdom came into being in October 2009 to replace the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords .

[ 242 ] The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council , including the same members as the Supreme Court, is the highest court of appeal for several independent Commonwealth countries, the British Overseas Territories and the Crown Dependencies .

[ 243 ] Both English law, which applies in England and Wales, and Northern Ireland law are based on common law (or case law ) principles.

[ 244 ] It originated in England in the Middle Ages and is the basis for many legal systems around the world.

[ 245 ] The courts of England and Wales are headed by the Senior Courts of England and Wales , consisting of the Court of Appeal , the High Court of Justice (for civil cases) and the Crown Court (for criminal cases).

[ 246 ] Scots law is a hybrid system based on common-law and civil-law principles. The chief courts are the Court of Session , for civil cases, [ 247 ] and the High Court of Justiciary , for criminal cases.

[ 248 ] The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom serves as the highest court of appeal for civil cases under Scots law.

[ 249 ] Crime in England and Wales increased in the period between 1981 and 1995, though since that peak there has been an overall fall of 66% in recorded crime from 1995 to 2015, [ 250 ] according to UK crime statistics . As of June 2023, the United Kingdom has the highest per-capita incarceration rate in Western Europe.

[ 255 ] [ 256 ] Since leaving the EU most disputes under UK-EU agreements are addressed through consultation between the parties. If consultation fails to resolve the issue, either party can request arbitration , typically at the PCA in The Hague .

[ 129 ] [ 257 ] [ 258 ] The EU–UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement states that the UK and EU have to cooperate and negotiate with each other with 'full mutual respect and good faith', as defined by international law.

[ 259 ] Under the Windsor Framework , Northern Ireland matters requiring interpretation of EU law go to the ECJ , though the Stormont Brake can prevent new EU rules from taking effect.

The laws and legal institutions of Scotland and of England and Wales were not merged by the Union of 1707. Thus, they remain separate 'law areas', with separate court systems (as does Northern Ireland), and it is necessary to distinguish Scots law and English law (and Northern Irish law).

The United Kingdom has three separate legal systems; one each for England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. This reflects its historical origins and the fact that both Scotland and Ireland, and later Northern Ireland, retained their own legal systems and traditions under the Acts of Union 1707 and 1800.

The UK Parliament is sovereign and the Scottish Parliament is subordinate. The White Paper had indicated that this was to be the approach taken in the legislation. The Scottish Parliament is not to be seen as a reflection of the settled will of the people of Scotland or of popular sovereignty but as a reflection of its subordination to a higher legal authority. Following the logic of this argument, the power of the Scottish Parliament to legislate can be withdrawn or overridden...

Notwithstanding substantial differences among the schemes, an important common factor is that the UK Parliament has not renounced legislative sovereignty in relation to the three nations concerned. For example, the Scottish Parliament is empowered to enact primary legislation on all matters, save those in relation to which competence is explicitly denied ... but this power to legislate on what may be termed "devolved matters" is concurrent with the Westminster Parliament's general power to legislate for Scotland on any matter at all, including devolved matters ... In theory, therefore, Westminster may legislate on Scottish devolved matters whenever it chooses...

The British parliament has the power to abolish the Scottish parliament and the Welsh assembly by a simple majority vote in both houses, but since both were sanctioned by referenda, it would be politically difficult to abolish them without the sanction of a further vote by the people. In this way, several of the constitutional measures introduced by the Blair government appear to be entrenched and not subject to a simple exercise of parliamentary sovereignty at Westminster.

[T]he distinctive involvement of two governments in the Northern Irish problem means that Northern Ireland's new arrangements rest upon an intergovernmental agreement. If this can be equated with a treaty, it could be argued that the forthcoming distribution of power between Westminster and Belfast has similarities with divisions specified in the written constitutions of federal states...Although the Agreement makes the general proviso that Westminster's 'powers to make legislation for Northern Ireland' remains 'unaffected', without an explicit categorical reference to reserved matters, it may be more difficult than in Scotland or Wales for devolved powers to be repatriated. The retraction of devolved powers would not merely entail consultation in Northern Ireland backed implicitly by the absolute power of parliamentary sovereignty but also the renegotiation of an intergovernmental agreement.

The UK Internal Market Act gives ministers sweeping powers to enforce mutual recognition and non-discrimination across the four jurisdictions. Existing differences and some social and health matters are exempted but these are much less extensive than the exemptions permitted under the EU Internal Market provisions. Only after an amendment in the House of Lords, the Bill was amended to provide a weak and non-binding consent mechanism for amendments (equivalent to the Sewel Convention) to the list of exemptions. The result is that, while the devolved governments retain regulatory competences, these are undermined by the fact that goods and services originating in, or imported into, England can be marketed anywhere.

the Internal Market Bill—a Bill that contains provisions which, if enacted, would significantly constrain, both legally and as a matter of practicality, the exercise by the devolved legislatures of their legislative competence; provisions that would be significantly more restrictive of the powers of the Scottish Parliament than either EU law or Articles 4 and 6 of the Acts of the Union...The UK Parliament passed the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020 and the Internal Market Act 2020 notwithstanding that, in each case, all three of the devolved legislatures had withheld consent.

Taken as a whole, the Internal Market Act imposes greater restrictions upon the competences of the devolved institutions than the provisions of the EU Single Market which it replaced, in spite of pledges to use common frameworks to address these issues.

Lord Hope , responsible for many of the leading judgments relating to the first two decades of devolution, regarded the legislation's terms as deliberately confrontational: 'this Parliament can do what it likes, but a different approach is essential if the union is to hold together'.

The Act has restrictive – and potentially damaging – consequences for the regulatory capacity of the devolved legislatures...This was not the first time since the Brexit referendum that the Convention had been set aside, but it was especially notable given that the primary purpose of the legislation was to constrain the capacity of the devolved institutions to use their regulatory autonomy...in practice, it constrains the ability of the devolved institutions to make effective regulatory choices for their territories in ways that do not apply to the choices made by the UK government and parliament for the English market.
