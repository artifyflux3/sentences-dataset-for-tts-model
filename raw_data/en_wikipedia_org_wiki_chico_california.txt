Located in the Sacramento Valley region of Northern California , the city had a population of 101,475 in the 2020 census , an increase from 86,187 in the 2010 census . Chico is the cultural and economic center of the northern Sacramento Valley, as well as the most populous city in California north of the capital city of Sacramento . The city is known as a college town , as the home of California State University, Chico , and for Bidwell Park , one of the largest urban parks in the world .

History [ edit ] Main article: History of Chico, California Chico's origins lie in Rancho del Arroyo Chico , a Mexican-era rancho granted by Governor Manuel Micheltorena in 1844.

View of Chico in 1856 California State University, Chico was founded in 1887.

The first known inhabitants of the area now known as Chico—a Spanish word meaning "little" [ 11 ] — were the Mechoopda Maidu Native Americans. Within the boundaries of modern day Chico, there existed a Maidu village, whose name was recorded as Bah-hahp'-ke , meaning "straight tree".

[ 12 ] The City of Chico was founded in 1860 by John Bidwell , a member of one of the first wagon trains to reach California in 1843. During the American Civil War , Camp Bidwell (named for John Bidwell, by then a brigadier general of the California Militia ), was established a mile outside Chico, by Lt. Col. A. E. Hooker with a company of cavalry and two of infantry, on August 26, 1863.

By early 1865, it was being referred to as Camp Chico when a post called Camp Bidwell was established in northeast California, later to be Fort Bidwell .

[ 13 ] The city became incorporated January 8, 1872.

Chico was home to a significant Chinese American community when it was first incorporated, but arsonists burned Chico's Chinatown in February 1886, driving Chinese Americans out of town.

[ 14 ] [ 15 ] Historian W.H. "Old Hutch" Hutchinson identified five events as the most seminal in Chico history. They included the arrival of John Bidwell in 1850, the arrival of the California and Oregon Railroad in 1870, the establishment in 1887 of the Northern Branch of the State Normal School, which later became California State University, Chico (Chico State), the purchase of the Sierra Lumber Company by the Diamond Match Company in 1900, and the development of the Army Air Base, which is now the Chico Municipal Airport .

[ 16 ] Other events include the construction and relocation of Route 99E through town in the early 1960s, the founding of Sierra Nevada Brewing Company in 1979—what would become one of the top breweries in the nation [ 17 ] —and the establishment of a "Green Line" on the western city limits as protection of agricultural lands.

[ 18 ] Geography [ edit ] Aerial view of Chico.

Chico is at the Sacramento Valley's northeast edge, one of the richest agricultural areas in the world. The Sierra Nevada mountains lie to the east and south, with Chico's city limits venturing several miles into the foothills. To the west, the Sacramento River lies 5 miles (8 km) from the city.

[ 19 ] Chico sits on the Sacramento Valley floor close to the foothills of the Cascade Range to the north and the Sierra Nevada range to the east and south.

Big Chico Creek is the demarcation line between the ranges.

[ 20 ] The city's terrain is generally flat, with increasingly hilly terrain beginning at the eastern city limits.

Bidwell Park .

According to the United States Census Bureau , the city has a total area of 34.3 square miles (89 km 2 ), of which 34.1 square miles (88 km 2 ) is land and 0.50% is water.

The city is bisected by Bidwell Park , which runs 5 miles (8 km) from the flat city center deep into the foothills.

The city is also traversed by two creeks and a flood channel, which feeds the Sacramento River. They are named Big Chico Creek, Little Chico Creek , and Lindo Channel (also known as Sandy Gulch, locally).

The city has been designated a Tree City USA for 31 years by the National Arbor Day Foundation .

[ 21 ] [ 22 ] Chico is made up of many districts and neighborhoods, including Downtown Chico, the South Campus neighborhood, and Barber .

Much of the local economy is driven by the presence of Chico State. Industries providing employment: educational, health and social services (30.3%), retail trade (14.9%), arts, entertainment, recreation, accommodation, and food services (12.6%).

Chico's downtown is a thriving area for unique, independent retail stores and restaurants. Farmers markets attract crowds on Saturday mornings and Thursday evenings. City Plaza hosts free concerts regularly during the summer. Performance venues large and small, bars, coffee shops, bookstores, and city offices contribute to a lively and flavorful experience.

Chico has long been a regional retail shopping destination. Chico's largest retail district is focused around the Chico Mall on East 20th Street. In the two decades since the Chico Mall was constructed, many national retailers have located nearby.

W 4th Street in Downtown Chico, with the Hotel Diamond in center.

Chico is also home to the North Valley Plaza Mall, the city's first enclosed shopping center. Construction on this mall began in 1965, and it was the county's largest shopping center until the Chico Mall was completed in 1988. For a few years, the "old" mall and the "new" mall competed against one another. The North Valley Plaza Mall was dealt a blow when JCPenney , one of the old mall's anchors, moved to the Chico Mall in 1993. The "old" mall slowly declined with increasing vacancies. After several failed attempts at revitalization, the North Valley Plaza Mall was overhauled in 2002, with the center of the mall demolished.

Agriculture [ edit ] Sierra Nevada Brewing Company .

Almonds are the number one crop in Chico and the surrounding area, only recently edging out rice. Other crops in the area include walnuts , kiwis , olives , peaches , and plums .

The city is bounded on the west by orchards with thousands of almond trees, and there are still a few pockets of orchards remaining within the contiguous city limits. The trees bloom with a pink/white flower in late February or early March. Millions of bees are brought in for pollination.

Walnuts are also major agricultural products in the area north and west of town. Unlike the almond crops of the area, walnuts do not have the same appeal as they do not bloom in the spring. However, the trees themselves grow much larger, live longer, and are far more resilient to harsh weather than almond trees, which are known to be sensitive to frost and can be felled easily in winter storms. In the area, walnuts are harvested following the almond harvest season, beginning in mid to late September and stretching well into October.

[ 37 ] The walnut variety Chico is named after the city.
