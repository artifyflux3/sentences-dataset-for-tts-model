Structure [ edit ] Linear ( l -C 3 H) [ edit ] μ D =3.551 Debye [ 1 ] 2 Π electronic ground state Simulated spectrum [ edit ] A rotational spectrum of the 2 Π electronic ground state of l -C 3 H can be made using the PGopher software (a Program for Simulating Rotational Structure, C. M. Western, University of Bristol, http://pgopher.chm.bris.ac.uk ) and molecular constants extracted from the literature.  These constants include μ=3.551 Debye [ 1 ] and others provided by Yamamoto et al. 1990, [ 2 ] given in units of MHz:  B=11189.052, D=0.0051365, A SO =432834.31, γ=-48.57, p=-7.0842, and q=-13.057.  A selection rule of ΔJ=0,1 was applied, with S=0.5.  The resulting simulation for the rotational spectrum of C 3 H at a temperature of 30 K agree well with observations.

[ 2 ] The simulated spectrum is shown in the figure at right with the approximate atmospheric transmission overplotted in blue. All of the strongest simulated lines with J < 8.5 are observed by Yamamoto et al.

[ 2 ] Cyclic ( c -C 3 H) [ edit ] μ D =2.4 Debye [ 3 ] electronic ground state Chemistry [ edit ] The molecule C 3 H has been observed in cold, dense molecular clouds .  The dominant formation and destruction mechanisms are presented below, for a typical cloud with temperature 10K.  The relative contributions of each reaction have been calculated using rates and abundances from the UMIST database for astrochemistry.

Compared to the competing reaction, C 3 H 3 + + C → C 4 H 2 + + H, also shown right, the destruction of C 3 H provides a much faster pathway for hydrocarbon growth.

Other molecules in the C 3 H family, C 2 H and C 3 H 2 , do not significantly contribute to the production of carbon-chain molecules, rather forming endpoints in this process. The production of C 2 H and C 3 H 2 essentially inhibits larger carbon-chain molecule formation, since neither they nor the products of their destruction are recycled into the hydrocarbon chemistry.

First astronomical detection [ edit ] The first confirmation of the existence of the interstellar molecule C 3 H was announced by W.M Irvine et al. at the January 1985 meeting of the American Astronomical Society.

[ 4 ] The group detected C 3 H in both the spectrum of the evolved carbon star IRC+10216 and in the molecular cloud TMC-1.  These results were formally published in July of the same year by Thaddeus et al.

[ 5 ] A 1987 paper by W.M. Irvine provides a comparison of detections for 39 molecules observed in cold (T k ≅10K), dark clouds, with particular emphasis paid to tri-carbon species, including C 3 H.

[ 6 ] Subsequent astronomical detections [ edit ] Later reports of astronomical detections of the C 3 H radical are given in chronological order below.

In 1987, Yamamoto et al.

[ 7 ] report measurements of the rotational spectra of the cyclic C 3 H radical (c-C 3 H) in the laboratory and in interstellar space towards TMC-1.  This publication marks the first terrestrial measurement of C 3 H.  Yamamoto et al. precisely determine molecular constants and identify 49 lines in the c-C 3 H rotational spectrum.  Both fine and hyperfine components are detected toward TMC-1, and the column density for the line of sight toward TMC-1 is estimated to be 6 trillion/cm 2 , which is comparable to the linear C 3 H radical (l-C 3 H).

M.L Marconi and A. Korth et al.

[ 8 ] reported a likely detection of C 3 H within the ionopause of Comet Halley in 1989.  Using the heavy ion analyzer (PICCA) on board the Giotto spacecraft they determined that C 3 H was responsible for producing a peak at 37amu detected within ~4500 km of the comet nucleus. Marconi et al. argue that a gas phase progenitor molecule for C 3 H is unlikely to exist within the ionopause and suggest that desorption from circumnuclear CHON dust grains may have instead produced the observed C 3 H.

In 1990, Yamamoto et al.

[ 2 ] detected C 3 H toward IRC + 10216 using the Nobeyama Radio Observatory's 45-m radio telescope.  They determine an upper limit for the column density of the ν 4 state  3 trillion/cm 2 . From additional laboratory measurements they determine an extremely low vibrationally excited state for the C 3 H radical: ν 4 ( 2 Σ μ )=610197(1230) MHz, caused by the Renner-Teller effect in the ν 4 (CCH bending) state.

J.G. Mangum and A. Wootten [ 9 ] report new detections of c-C 3 H towards 13 of 19 observed Galactic molecular clouds.  They measure relative abundance of C 3 H to C 3 H 2 : N(c-C 3 H)/N(C 3 H 2 ) = 9.04±2.87 x 10 −2 . This ratio does not change systematically for warmer sources, which they suggest provides evidence that the two ring molecules have a common precursor in C 3 H 3 + .

L.A. Nyman et al.

[ 10 ] present a molecular line survey of the carbon star IRAS 15194-5115 using the 15m Swedish-ESO Submillimetre Telescope to probe the 3 and 1.3 mm bands. Comparing the molecular abundances with those of IRC + 10216, they find  C 3 H to have similar abundances in both sources.

In 1993, M. Guelin et al.

[ 11 ] map the emission from the 95 GHz and 98 GHz lines of the C 3 H radicals in IRC+10216.  This reveals a  shell-like distribution of the C 3 H emission and time-dependent chemistry. The close correspondence between the emission peaks of C 3 H and the species <noautolink>MgNC</noautolink> and C 4 H suggests a fast common formation mechanism, suggested to be desorption from dust grains.

Turner et al.

[ 12 ] survey 10 hydrocarbon species, including l-C 3 H and c-C 3 H in three translucent clouds and TMC-1 and L183. Abundances are measured or estimated for each.  The mean cyclic-to-linear abundance ratio for C 3 H is found to be 2.7, although a large variation in this ratio is observed from source to source.

In 2004, N. Kaifu et al.

[ 13 ] completed the first spectral line survey toward TMC-1 in the frequency range 8.8-50.0 GHz with the 45-m radio telescope at Nobeyama Radio Observatory. They detected 414 lines of 38 molecular species including c-C 3 H and compiled spectral charts and improved molecular constants for several carbon-chain molecules.

Martin et al.

[ 14 ] made the first spectral line survey towards an extragalactic source, targeting the starburst galaxy NGC253 across the frequency range 129.1-175.2 GHz. Approximately 100 spectral features were identified as transitions from 25 different molecular species, including a tentative first extra-galactic detection of C 3 H.
