This includes generalized functions , pseudo-differential operators , wave front sets , Fourier integral operators , oscillatory integral operators , and paradifferential operators .

The term microlocal implies localisation not only with respect to location in the space, but also with respect to cotangent space directions at a given point. This gains in importance on manifolds of dimension greater than one.
