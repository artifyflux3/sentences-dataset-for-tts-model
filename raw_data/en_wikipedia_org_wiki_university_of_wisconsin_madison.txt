It was founded in 1848 when Wisconsin achieved statehood and is the flagship campus of the University of Wisconsin System . The 933-acre (378 ha) main campus is located on the shores of Lake Mendota ; the university also owns and operates a 1,200-acre (486 ha) arboretum 4 miles (6.4 km) south of the main campus.

UW–Madison is organized into 13 schools and colleges, which enrolled approximately 34,200 undergraduate and 14,300 graduate and professional students in 2024.

[ 6 ] Its academic programs include 136 undergraduate majors, 148 master's degree programs, and 120 doctoral programs. Wisconsin is one of the founding members of the Association of American Universities . It is considered a Public Ivy and is classified among "R1: Doctoral Universities – Very High Research Activity".

[ 9 ] UW–Madison was also the home of both the prominent "Wisconsin School" of economics and diplomatic history . It ranked sixth among U.S. universities in research expenditures in 2023, according to the National Science Foundation .

[ 10 ] As of March 2023 [update] , 20 Nobel laureates , 41 Pulitzer Prize winners, 2 Fields medalists , and 1 Turing Award recipient have been affiliated with UW–Madison as alumni, faculty, or researchers . It is also a leading producer of Fulbright Scholars and MacArthur Fellows .

[ 11 ] The Wisconsin Badgers compete in 25 intercollegiate sports in NCAA Division I , primarily in the Big Ten Conference , and have won 31 national championships . Wisconsin students and alumni have won 50 Olympic medals (including 13 gold medals).

[ 12 ] History [ edit ] Establishment [ edit ] An early illustration of the campus in 1879, including Bascom Hill and Washburn Observatory The university had its official beginnings when the Wisconsin Territorial Legislature in its 1838 session passed a law incorporating a " University of the Territory of Wisconsin ", and a high-ranking board of visitors was appointed. However, this body (the predecessor of the UW board of regents ) never actually accomplished anything before Wisconsin was incorporated as a state in 1848.

[ 13 ] The Wisconsin Constitution provided for "the establishment of a state university, at or near the seat of state government..." and directed by the state legislature to be governed by a board of regents and administered by a chancellor . On July 26, 1848, Nelson Dewey , Wisconsin's first governor , signed the act that formally created the University of Wisconsin.

[ 14 ] John H. Lathrop became the university's first chancellor, in the fall of 1849.

[ 15 ] With John W. Sterling as the university's first professor (mathematics), the first class of 17 students met at Madison Female Academy on February 5, 1849.

A permanent campus site was soon selected: an area of 50 acres (20.2 ha) "bounded north by Fourth lake, east by a street to be opened at right angles with King street", [later State Street] "south by Mineral Point Road (University Avenue), and west by a carriage-way from said road to the lake." The regents' building plans called for a "main edifice fronting towards the Capitol, three stories high, surmounted by an observatory for astronomical observations." [ 16 ] This building, University Hall, now known as Bascom Hall , was finally completed in 1859. On October 10, 1916, a fire destroyed the building's dome, which was never replaced.

North Hall , constructed in 1851, was actually the first building on campus. In 1854, Levi Booth and Charles T. Wakeley became the first graduates of the university, and in 1892 the university awarded its first PhD to future university president Charles R. Van Hise .

[ 17 ] Late 19th century [ edit ] " Sifting and winnowing " plaque on Bascom Hall, UW–Madison tribute to academic freedom Female students were first admitted to the University of Wisconsin during the American Civil War in 1863.

[ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] The Wisconsin State Legislature formally designated the university as the Wisconsin land-grant institution in 1866.

[ 14 ] In 1875, William Smith Noland became the first known African-American to graduate from the university.

[ 14 ] [ 21 ] Science Hall was constructed in 1888 as one of the world's first buildings to use I-beams .

[ 22 ] On April 4, 1892, the first edition of the student-run The Daily Cardinal was published.

[ 23 ] In 1894 an unsuccessful attempt was made by Oliver Elwin Wells , Superintendent of Public Instruction of Wisconsin to expel Richard T. Ely from his chair of director of the School of Economics, Political Science, and History at Wisconsin for purportedly teaching socialistic doctrines. This effort failed, with the Wisconsin state Board of Regents issuing a ringing proclamation in favor of academic freedom , acknowledging the necessity for freely " sifting and winnowing " among competing claims of truth.

[ 24 ] Early 20th century and the Wisconsin Idea [ edit ] Bascom Hall fire that destroyed the dome in 1916 [ 25 ] Research, teaching, and service at the UW is influenced by a tradition known as the " Wisconsin Idea ", first articulated by UW–Madison President Charles Van Hise in 1904, when he declared "I shall never be content until the beneficent influence of the University reaches every home in the state." [ 26 ] The Wisconsin Idea holds that the boundaries of the university should be the boundaries of the state, and that the research conducted at UW–Madison should be applied to solve problems and improve health, quality of life, the environment , and agriculture for all citizens of the state. The Wisconsin Idea permeates the university's work and helps forge close working relationships among university faculty and students, and the state's industries and government.

[ 27 ] Based in Wisconsin's populist history, the Wisconsin Idea continues to inspire the work of the faculty, staff, and students who aim to solve real-world problems by working together across disciplines and demographics.

[ 28 ] During this period, numerous significant research milestones were met, including the discoveries of Vitamin A and Vitamin B in 1913 and 1916, respectively, by Elmer V. McCollum and Marguerite Davis , as well as the " Single-grain experiment " conducted by Stephen Moulton Babcock and Edwin B. Hart from 1907 to 1911, paving the way for modern nutrition as a science.

[ 14 ] In 1923, Harry Steenbock invented a process for adding vitamin D to milk and other foods, and in 1925, the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation was chartered to control patenting and patent income on UW–Madison inventions.

[ 14 ] The UW Graduate School had been separated in 1904-1905.

[ 14 ] In 1909, William Purdy and Paul Beck wrote On, Wisconsin , the UW–Madison athletic fight song.

[ 29 ] Radio station 9XM, the oldest continually operating radio station in the United States, was founded on campus in 1919 (now WHA (970 AM).

[ 14 ] The Memorial Union opened in 1928, and the University of Wisconsin–Madison Arboretum opened in 1934.

Students of the Experimental College , 1930 The University of Wisconsin Experimental College was a two-year college designed and led by Alexander Meiklejohn in 1927 with a great books , liberal arts curriculum. Students followed a uniform curriculum that sought to teach democracy and foster an intrinsic love of learning, but the college developed a reputation for radicalism and wanton anarchy in which students lived and worked with their teachers, had no fixed schedule, no compulsory lessons, and no semesterly grades. The advisers taught primarily through tutorial instead of lectures. The Great Depression and lack of outreach to Wisconsinites and UW faculty led to the college's closure in 1932.

[ 30 ] In 1936, UW–Madison began an artist-in-residence program with John Steuart Curry , the first ever at a university.

[ 14 ] In the 1940s, Warfarin (Coumadin) was developed at UW by the laboratory of Karl Paul Link and named after the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation.

[ 31 ] During World War II, the University of Wisconsin was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a Navy commission.

[ 32 ] Late 20th century to present [ edit ] See also: University of Wisconsin System and Sterling Hall bombing Bascom Hill with crosses placed by students protesting the Vietnam War and sign reading, "Bascom Memorial Cemetery, Class of 1968" Over time, additional campuses were added to the university. The University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee was created in 1956, and UW–Green Bay and UW–Parkside in 1968. Ten freshman-sophomore centers were also added to this system.

[ 33 ] In 1971, Wisconsin legislators passed a law merging the University of Wisconsin with the nine universities and four freshman-sophomore branch campuses of the Wisconsin State Universities System , creating the University of Wisconsin System and bringing the two higher education systems under a single board of regents.

UW–Madison's Howard Temin , a virologist, co-discovered the enzyme reverse transcriptase in 1969, [ 34 ] and The Badger Herald was founded as a conservative student paper the same year.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, UW–Madison was shaken by a series of student protests, and by the use of force by authorities in response, comprehensively documented in the film The War at Home . The first major demonstrations protested the presence on campus of recruiters for the Dow Chemical Company, which supplied the napalm used in the Vietnam War . Authorities used force to quell the disturbance. The struggle was documented in the book, They Marched into Sunlight , [ 35 ] as well as the PBS documentary Two Days in October .

[ 36 ] Among the students injured in the protest was former Madison mayor Paul Soglin .

Another target of protest was the Army Mathematics Research Center (AMRC) in Sterling Hall, which was also home of the physics department. The student newspaper, The Daily Cardinal , published a series of investigative articles stating that AMRC was pursuing research directly pursuant to US Department of Defense requests, and supportive of military operations in Vietnam. AMRC became a magnet for demonstrations, in which protesters chanted "U.S. out of Vietnam! Smash Army Math!" On August 24, 1970, near 3:40 am, a bomb exploded next to Sterling Hall, aimed at destroying the Army Math Research Center.

[ 37 ] Despite the late hour, a post doctoral physics researcher , Robert Fassnacht , was in the lab and was killed in the explosion. The physics department was severely damaged, while the intended target, the AMRC, was scarcely affected.

Karleton Armstrong , Dwight Armstrong , and David Fine were found responsible for the blast.

Leo Burt was identified as a suspect, but was never apprehended or tried.

[ 38 ] In 1998, UW–Madison's James Thomson first isolated and cultured human embryonic stem cells .

[ 14 ] Campus [ edit ] Camp Randall memorial arch The main campus of the university is situated partially on the Madison Isthmus between Lake Mendota and Lake Monona . The main campus comprises 933 acres (378 ha) of land, while the entire campus, including research stations throughout the state, is over 10,600 acres (4,290 ha) in area. The campus contains four National Historic Landmarks .

[ 39 ] The central campus is on an urban layout mostly coinciding with the city of Madison's street grid, exceptions being the suburban University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics , and the Department of Psychiatry & Clinics in the West Side research park. It is approximately 1 mile (1.6 km) west of the Wisconsin State Capitol , connected by State Street . The University of Wisconsin–Madison Arboretum , a demonstration area for native ecosystems, is located on the west side of Madison.

[ 40 ] [ 41 ] UW–Madison's campus includes many buildings designed or supervised by architects J. T. W. Jennings and Arthur Peabody . The hub of campus life is the Memorial Union . It also features the Allen Centennial Gardens and University of Wisconsin–Madison Lakeshore Nature Preserve . UW–Madison's campus has been ranked as one of the most beautiful college campuses in the United States by Travel + Leisure and Condé Nast Traveler .

[ 42 ] [ 43 ] One unusual feature of the campus is the Babcock Hall dairy plant and store, a fully functional dairy well known for its ice cream.

[ 44 ] [ 45 ] Bascom Hill [ edit ] Main article: Bascom Hill Bascom Hall sits atop Bascom Hill at the heart of campus As one of the icons on campus, Bascom Hall, [ 46 ] at the top of Bascom Hill, is often considered the "heart of the campus." Built in 1857, a decorative dome that once sat atop the structure was destroyed by fire in 1916. The structure has been added to several times over the years. The building currently houses the office of the chancellor and vice chancellors. Bascom Hall is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a contributing building within the Bascom Hill Historic District.

[ 47 ] Flanking both sides of Bascom Hall are the two oldest surviving buildings on campus. Designed by John F. Rague in a Federal style , the oldest structure in the university, North Hall (built in 1851), was planned to be similar to the dormitories at the University of Michigan .

[ 48 ] It is still in use as the home of the Department of Political Science. Its opposite twin, South Hall (built in 1855), originally served as the women's dormitory prior to the establishment of the Female College Building in 1871 (today the location of Chadbourne Hall).

[ 49 ] The administrative offices of the College of Letters and Science now occupy the building.

Evening view of the Carillon Tower The Carillon Tower, erected in 1936, was designed by Warren Powers Laird and Paul Philippe Cret so that the balustrade echoes that on Bascom Hall.

[ 50 ] The carillon has 56 bronze bells, with the largest weighing 6,800 pounds.

[ 51 ] An automated system rings bells on the hour, playing songs such as " Varsity " and " On, Wisconsin!

". East of the tower lies a monument to the Sauk leader Black Hawk , whose flight through the Madison area represented the last armed conflict between the United States Army and native peoples in southern Wisconsin.

[ 52 ] Several other notable architectural styles are represented in the historic core of the university. Following the 1884 fire that destroyed the original, Milwaukee architect Henry C. Koch designed the new Science Hall (built in 1888) in a Romanesque Revival style .

[ 53 ] The Education Building, originally designed to house the College of Engineering, features a Beaux-Arts style .

[ 54 ] Structures built in a Neoclassical style include Birge Hall and the Wisconsin Historical Society .

[ 55 ] Located at the foot of the hill, Music Hall was designed in 1878 by Madison architect David R. Jones in a Gothic Revival style.

Van Hise Hall is home to most of the languages departments of the university [ 56 ] and the upper floors house the offices of the University of Wisconsin System's president and its board of regents. At 241 feet and 19 stories, Van Hise is the second-tallest building in Madison and one of the tallest educational buildings in the world.

[ 57 ] Because of its placement atop Bascom Hill it towers over the State Capitol as the building with the highest elevation in the city. Van Hise Hall was constructed in 1967 and its destruction is slated for sometime around 2025 as part of the university's campus master plan.

[ 58 ] The George L. Mosse Humanities Building, located on Library Mall, was built in the late 1960s in the Brutalist style. Although debunked, the campus myth is that the building (with its poor ventilation, narrow windows, inclined base, and cantilevered upper floors) was designed to be "riot-proof".

[ 59 ] [ 60 ] Its seven floors house the history, art, and music departments. The most recent campus master plan calls for it to be demolished and replaced with two other buildings, [ 61 ] in part because of water damage.

[ 62 ] [ 63 ] Wisconsin Union [ edit ] Main article: Wisconsin Union The Memorial Union terrace on Lake Mendota The University of Wisconsin–Madison has two student union facilities: Memorial Union and Union South. The older, Memorial Union , was built in 1928 to honor American World War I veterans . Also known as the Union or the Terrace, it has gained a reputation as one of the most beautiful student centers on a university campus. Located on the shore of Lake Mendota , it is a popular spot for socializing among both students and the public, who enjoy gazing at the lake and its sailboats. The union is known for the Rathskeller , a Ratskeller or German pub adjacent to the lake terrace. Political debates and backgammon and sheepshead games over a beer on the terrace are common among students. The Rathskeller serves "Rathskeller Ale", a beer brewed expressly for the Terrace. Memorial Union was the first union at a public university to serve beer.

[ 64 ] Memorial Union is home to many arts venues, including several art galleries, the Wisconsin Union Theater, and a craft shop that provides courses and facilities for arts and crafts activities. Students and Madison community members alike congregate at the Memorial Union for the films and concerts each week. An advisory referendum to renovate and expand Memorial Union was approved by the student body in 2006, and the university completed the renovation in 2017.

[ 65 ] Union South was first built in 1971 to better accommodate a growing student enrollment. The original structure was demolished in 2008 and replaced with a LEED -certified building which opened in 2011.

[ 66 ] The building contains several dining options, an art gallery, a movie theater, a climbing wall, a bowling alley, event spaces, and a hotel.

[ 67 ] [ 68 ] The Wisconsin Union also provides a home for the Wisconsin Union Directorate Student Programming Board, which provides regular programs for both students and community members. One of the most well-known members is the Wisconsin Hoofers , a club that organizes outdoor recreational activities.

[ 69 ] Henry Mall [ edit ] Main article: Henry Mall Historic District Henry Mall is surrounded by departments of the College of Agricultural and Life Sciences Henry Mall is a 50-foot wide and 575-foot long landscaped quadrangle that was designed by architects Warren Laird and Paul Cret and constructed between 1903 and 1961.

[ 70 ] The mall contains buildings that represent Neoclassical, Beaux-Arts, Italian Renaissance Revival , and Modern Movement styles of architecture.

[ 70 ] Laird and Cret were hired to draw up a master plan for future construction at the campus, with the idea of creating a more unified and aesthetically pleasing area. The departments around the Henry Mall area were conceived to be "technical" and geographically close to the science departments and the university farm.

[ 70 ] The Mall features several notable buildings, including Agriculture Hall , the Agronomy Building, the Agricultural Engineering Building , and the Agricultural Chemistry Building . The Mall is also home to several artworks, including the Hoard statue by Gutzon Borglum , which honors William Dempster Hoard , the publisher of Hoard's Dairyman magazine.

[ 70 ] [ 71 ] The Henry Boulder, a chunk of gneiss on the mall with a plaque, is dedicated to Dean William Arnon Henry , the mall's namesake, who helped establish the College of Agriculture.

[ 70 ] Other buildings in the area include the Stovall Lab of Hygiene and the Genetics Building.

[ 72 ] [ 73 ] The Henry Mall Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1992.

[ 70 ] Effigy mounds [ edit ] UW–Madison claims more distinct archaeological sites than on any other university campus.

[ 74 ] The campus contains four clusters of effigy mounds located at Observatory Hill, Willow Drive, Picnic Point, and Eagle Heights. These sites, reflecting thousands of years of human habitation in the area, have survived to a greater or lesser degree on campus, depending on location and past building activities. Surviving sites are marked and fenced on the campus, ensuring that they are not disturbed. Wisconsin statutes protect effigy mounds by giving them a five-foot buffer zone.

[ 75 ] [ 76 ] The Lakeshore Nature Preserve Committee is endeavoring to "...safeguard beloved cultural landscapes," through aggressive enforcement of measures for the preservation of such zones and advocating for broader buffers where possible.

[ 77 ] Museums [ edit ] Interior of the Chazen Museum of Art The Geology Museum features rocks, minerals, and fossils from around the world. Highlights include a blacklight room, a walk-through cave, and a fragment of the Barringer meteorite . Some noteworthy fossils include the first dinosaur skeleton assembled in Wisconsin (an Edmontosaurus ), a shark ( Squalicorax ) and a floating colony of sea lilies ( Uintacrinus ), both from the Cretaceous chalk of Kansas , and the Boaz Mastodon , a found on a farm in southwestern Wisconsin in 1897.

[ 78 ] The Chazen Museum of Art , formerly the Elvehjem Museum of Art, maintains a collection of paintings, drawings, sculpture, prints and photographs spanning over 700 years of art.

[ 79 ] The university's Zoological Museum maintains a collection of approximately 500,000 zoological specimens, which can be used for research and instruction. A special collection contains skeletons, artifacts, and research papers associated with the Galápagos Islands . Since 1978, the UW–Madison Zoological Museum has been one of only three museums granted permission by the Ecuadoran Government to collect anatomical specimens from the Galápagos Islands.

[ 80 ] The L. R. Ingersoll Physics Museum contains a range of exhibits demonstrating classical and modern physics . Many of the exhibits allow for hands-on interaction by visitors. The museum also has a number of historical instruments and pictures on display.

[ 81 ] Organization and administration [ edit ] The Law Building on Bascom Hill The University of Wisconsin–Madison is divided into eight main undergraduate schools and colleges and four main professional schools, some of which have further divisions: [ 82 ] College of Agricultural and Life Sciences School of Business School of Education College of Engineering Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies Graduate School School of Human Ecology Law School College of Letters & Science School of Computer, Data & Information Sciences Mead Witter School of Music School of Journalism & Mass Communication School of Social Work School of Library and Information Studies Robert M. La Follette School of Public Affairs School of Medicine and Public Health School of Nursing School of Pharmacy School of Veterinary Medicine UW–Madison is governed by the board of regents of the University of Wisconsin System , which governs each of the state's 13 comprehensive public universities.

[ 83 ] The board has 18 members; 16 are appointed by the governor of Wisconsin, while two are students of the system. Furthermore, the elected superintendent of public instruction serves as an ex-officio member.

[ 84 ] The board establishes the regulations and budgets for the university and appoints the chancellor .

Jennifer Mnookin , former dean of the UCLA School of Law , has served as the chancellor of UW–Madison since 2022.

[ 85 ] Academics [ edit ] Wisconsin Institutes for Discovery The University of Wisconsin–Madison, the flagship campus of the University of Wisconsin System , [ 86 ] is a large, four-year research university comprising twenty associated colleges and schools.

[ 87 ] In addition to undergraduate and graduate divisions in agriculture and life sciences, business, education, engineering, human ecology , journalism and mass communication , letters and science, music, nursing , pharmacy , and social welfare , the university also maintains graduate and professional schools in environmental studies , law, library and information studies , medicine and public health (School of Medicine and Public Health) , public affairs , and veterinary medicine .

[ 5 ] The four year, full-time undergraduate instructional program is classified by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching as "arts and science plus professions" with a high graduate coexistence.

[ 87 ] The largest university college, the College of Letters and Science , enrolls approximately half of the undergraduate student body and is made up of 38 departments and five professional schools [ 88 ] that instruct students and carry out research in a wide variety of fields, such as astronomy , economics, geography , history, linguistics , and zoology . The graduate instructional program is classified by Carnegie as "comprehensive with medical/veterinary." In 2008, it granted the third largest number of doctorates in the nation.

[ 87 ] [ 89 ] Admissions [ edit ] Undergraduate admissions statistics 2023 entering class [ 90 ] Change vs.

[ 198 ] [ 199 ] [ 200 ] Mascot [ edit ] Main article: Bucky Badger Bucky Badger The school mascot is an anthropomorphized badger named Bucky who dons a sweater affixed with the UW–Madison athletic logo (currently the red "Motion W"). Beginning in 1890, the university's first Bucky Badger was a live, temperamental and unruly badger who was quickly retired. Although the nickname of the Wisconsin teams remained the "Badgers", it was not until Art Evans drew the early caricature version of Bucky in 1940 that today's recognizable image of Bucky was adopted. In 1949, a contest was held to name the mascot, but no consensus was reached after only a few entries were received. In reaction, the contest committee chose the name Buckingham U. Badger, or "Bucky", for short.

At Wisconsin football games in the 1920s live mascots were used to inspire fans. The animals used included a black bear, a bonnet monkey, and live badgers. 1949 was the first year a student sporting a papier-mâché badger head appeared; this subsequently replaced the use of live badgers.

[ 201 ] The team's nickname originates from the state nickname . In the 1820s, many lead miners and their families lived in the mines in which they worked until adequate above-ground shelters were built, and thus were compared to badgers.

[ 202 ] [ 203 ] In 2009, Fulton Market Films produced the documentary Being Bucky which followed the lives of seven Wisconsin students who take on the role of Bucky Badger.

[ 204 ] Being Bucky won "Best Documentary Film" at the Wisconsin Film Festival and went on to play in local Wisconsin movie theaters.
