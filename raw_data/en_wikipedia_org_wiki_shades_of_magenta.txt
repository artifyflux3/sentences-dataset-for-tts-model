Definition of magenta [ edit ] The most saturated magentas that humans are able to perceive lie on the line of purples , which connects violet and red in the chromaticity diagram Magenta is a color made up of equal parts of red and blue light . This would be the precise definition of the color as defined for computer display (the color #FF00FF shown in the color swatch above). It is a pure chroma on the RGB color wheel. In HSV color space , magenta has a hue of 300°.

Magenta is not a spectral but an extraspectral color: it cannot be generated by light of a single wavelength . Humans, being trichromats , can only see as far as 380 nanometers into the spectrum , i.e., as far as violet.

The hue magenta is the complement of green : magenta pigments absorb green light, thus magenta and green are opposite colors.

Three major historical variations of magenta [ edit ] Magenta dye (original variation) (1860) [ edit ] Magenta dye Color coordinates Hex triplet #CA1F7B sRGB B ( r , g , b ) (202, 31, 123) HSV ( h , s , v ) (328°, 85%, 79%) CIELCh uv ( L , C , h ) (46, 100, 347°) Source Handprint.com [ 1 ] ISCC–NBS descriptor Vivid purplish red B : Normalized to [0–255] (byte) Before printer's magenta was invented in the 1890s for CMYK printing, and electric magenta was invented in the 1980s for computer displays, these two artificially engineered colors were preceded by the color displayed at right, which is the color originally called magenta made from coal tar dyes in the year 1859.

[ 2 ] Besides being called original magenta , magenta dye color is also called rich magenta to distinguish it from the colors printer's magenta and electric magenta , shown below.

Magenta was one of the first aniline dyes , discovered shortly after the Battle of Magenta (1859), which occurred near the town of Magenta in northern Italy .  The color was originally called fuchsine or roseine , but for marketing purposes in 1860 the color name was changed to magenta after the battle. Hence, the color is named indirectly after the town.

Process magenta (pigment magenta) (printer's magenta) (1890s) [ edit ] Magenta (subtractive primary) Color coordinates Hex triplet #FF0090 sRGB B ( r , g , b ) (255, 0, 144) HSV ( h , s , v ) (326°, 100%, 100%) CIELCh uv ( L , C , h ) (55, 137, 350°) Source tintbook.com [ 3 ] CMYK ISCC–NBS descriptor Vivid purplish red B : Normalized to [0–255] (byte) Cyan , magenta and black and yellow are the three subtractive primary colors used in printing .

In color printing , the color called process magenta or pigment magenta is one of the three primary pigment colors which, along with yellow and cyan , constitute the three subtractive primary colors of pigment. (The secondary colors of pigment are blue, green, and red.) The CMYK printing process was invented in the 1890s, when newspapers began to publish color comic strips .

Process magenta is not an RGB color, and there is no fixed conversion from CMYK primaries to RGB. Different formulations are used for printer's ink, so there can be variations in the printed color that is pure magenta ink. A typical formulation of process magenta is shown in the color box at right. The source of the color shown at right is the color magenta that is shown in the diagram located at the bottom of the following website offering tintbooks for CMYK printing: Tintbooks - Get Accurate CMYK Color Results For Your Printing Projects .
