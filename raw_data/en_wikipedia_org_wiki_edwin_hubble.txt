**Edwin Powell Hubble** (November 20, 1889 – September 28, 1953)[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble#cite_note-NASABio-1) was an American astronomer. He played a crucial role in establishing the fields of [extragalactic astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extragalactic_astronomy "Extragalactic astronomy") and [observational cosmology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_cosmology "Observational cosmology").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble#cite_note-space.com-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble#cite_note-futurism-3)

Hubble proved that many objects previously thought to be clouds of dust and gas and classified as "[nebulae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebula "Nebula")" were actually [galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy "Galaxy") beyond the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way "Milky Way").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble#cite_note-4) He used the strong direct [relationship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Period-luminosity_relation "Period-luminosity relation") between a [classical Cepheid variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Cepheid_variable "Classical Cepheid variable")'s [luminosity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminosity "Luminosity") and [pulsation period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_function "Periodic function")[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble#cite_note-udalski99-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble#cite_note-sos08-6) (discovered in 1908 by [Henrietta Swan Leavitt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Swan_Leavitt "Henrietta Swan Leavitt")[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble#cite_note-Henrietta-7)) for scaling [galactic and extragalactic distances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_distance_ladder "Cosmic distance ladder").[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble#cite_note-freedman2001-8)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble#cite_note-freedman2010-9)

Hubble confirmed in 1929 that the [recessional velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recessional_velocity "Recessional velocity") of a galaxy increases with its distance from Earth, a behavior that became known as [Hubble's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble%27s_law "Hubble's law"), although it had been proposed two years earlier by [Georges Lemaître](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Lema%C3%AEtre "Georges Lemaître").[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble#cite_note-10) The Hubble law implies that the universe is expanding.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble#cite_note-Hubbles_Law-11) A decade before, the American astronomer [Vesto Slipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vesto_Slipher "Vesto Slipher") had provided the first evidence that the light from many of these nebulae was strongly red-shifted, indicative of high recession velocities.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble#cite_note-12)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble#cite_note-13)

Hubble's name is most widely recognized for the [Hubble Space Telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope "Hubble Space Telescope"), which was named in his honor, with a model prominently displayed in his hometown of [Marshfield, Missouri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshfield,_Missouri "Marshfield, Missouri").

Early life and education
------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Edwin_Hubble&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Early life and education")]

Edwin Hubble was born in 1889 to Virginia Lee Hubble (née James) (1864–1934)[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble#cite_note-14) and John Powell Hubble, an insurance executive, in Marshfield, Missouri, and moved to [Wheaton, Illinois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheaton,_Illinois "Wheaton, Illinois"), in 1900.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble#cite_note-15) In his younger days, he was noted more for his athletic prowess than his intellectual abilities, although he did earn good grades in every subject except spelling. Edwin was a gifted athlete, playing [baseball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball "Baseball"), [football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football "American football"), and running track in both high school and college. He won seven first places and a third place in a single high school [track and field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field "Track and field") meet in 1906, and he played a variety of positions on the [basketball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball "Basketball") court, from [center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_(basketball) "Center (basketball)") to [shooting guard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_guard "Shooting guard"). Hubble led the [University of Chicago's basketball team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Maroons_men%27s_basketball "Chicago Maroons men's basketball") to their first [Big Ten Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Big_Ten_Conference_men%27s_basketball_regular_season_champions "List of Big Ten Conference men's basketball regular season champions") title in [1907](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1906%E2%80%9307_Chicago_Maroons_men%27s_basketball_team "1906–07 Chicago Maroons men's basketball team").[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble#cite_note-Gale_E._Christianson_1996-16)

### Undergraduate studies

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Edwin_Hubble&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Undergraduate studies")]

Hubble's studies at the [University of Chicago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Chicago "University of Chicago") were concentrated on [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), astronomy and [philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy "Philosophy"), which resulted in a [Bachelor of Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Science "Bachelor of Science") degree by 1910. For a year he was also a student laboratory assistant for the physicist [Robert Millikan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Andrews_Millikan "Robert Andrews Millikan"), a future [Nobel Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize "Nobel Prize") winner.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble#cite_note-:0-17) Hubble also became a member of [Kappa Sigma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kappa_Sigma "Kappa Sigma") fraternity. A [Rhodes Scholar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodes_Scholarship "Rhodes Scholarship"), he spent three years at [The Queen's College, Oxford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Queen%27s_College,_Oxford "The Queen's College, Oxford") studying [jurisprudence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisprudence "Jurisprudence") instead of science (as a promise to his dying father),[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble#cite_note-Times-18) and later added studies in literature and Spanish,[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble#cite_note-Times-18) eventually earning a master's degree.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble#cite_note-19)

In 1909, Hubble's father moved his family from [Chicago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago "Chicago"), Illinois to [Shelbyville, Kentucky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelbyville,_Kentucky "Shelbyville, Kentucky"), so that the family could live in a small town, ultimately settling in nearby [Louisville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisville,_Kentucky "Louisville, Kentucky"). His father died in the winter of 1913, while Edwin was still in England. In the following summer, Edwin returned home to care for his mother, two sisters, and younger brother, along with his brother William. The family moved once more to Everett Avenue, in Louisville's Highlands neighborhood, to accommodate Edwin and William.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble#cite_note-20)

Hubble was a dutiful son, who despite his intense interest in astronomy since boyhood, acquiesced to his father's request to study law, first at the University of Chicago and later at Oxford University. In this time, he also took some math and science courses. After the death of his father in 1913, Edwin returned to the Midwest from Oxford but did not have the motivation to practice law. Instead, he proceeded to teach Spanish, [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics") and [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics") at [New Albany High School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Albany_High_School_(Indiana) "New Albany High School (Indiana)") in [New Albany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Albany,_Indiana "New Albany, Indiana"), Indiana, where he also coached the boys' basketball team. After a year of high-school teaching, he entered graduate school with the help of his former professor from the University of Chicago to study astronomy at the university's [Yerkes Observatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yerkes_Observatory "Yerkes Observatory"), where he received his Ph.D. in 1921. His [dissertation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thesis "Thesis") was titled "Photographic Investigations of Faint Nebulae".[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble#cite_note-21) At Yerkes, he had access to its 40-inch refractor telescope built by [George Ellery Hale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Ellery_Hale "George Ellery Hale") in 1897, as well as an innovative 26-inch (61 cm) reflector telescope.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble#cite_note-:0-17)

[![Image 3](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Hubble_identity_card.jpg/330px-Hubble_identity_card.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hubble_identity_card.jpg)

Hubble's identity card in the [American Expeditionary Forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Expeditionary_Forces "American Expeditionary Forces").

After the [United States declared war on Germany in 1917](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_declaration_of_war_on_Germany_(1917) "United States declaration of war on Germany (1917)") during [World War I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I "World War I"), Hubble rushed to complete his Ph.D. dissertation so he could join the military. Hubble volunteered for the [United States Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army "United States Army") and was assigned to the newly created [86th Division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/86th_Infantry_Division_(United_States) "86th Infantry Division (United States)"), where he served in the 2nd Battalion, 343rd Infantry Regiment. He rose to the rank of major,[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble#cite_note-22) and was found fit for overseas duty on July 9, 1918; the 86th Division moved overseas, but never saw combat as it was broken up and its personnel used as replacements in other units. After the end of World War I, Hubble spent a year at [University of Cambridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge "University of Cambridge"), where he renewed his studies of astronomy.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble#cite_note-23)

In 1919, Hubble was offered a staff position at the [Carnegie Institution for Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Institution_for_Science "Carnegie Institution for Science")'s [Mount Wilson Observatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Wilson_Observatory "Mount Wilson Observatory"), near [Pasadena, California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasadena,_California "Pasadena, California"), by [George Ellery Hale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Ellery_Hale "George Ellery Hale"), the founder and director of the observatory. Hubble remained on staff at Mount Wilson until his death in 1953. Shortly before his death, Hubble became the first astronomer to use the newly completed giant 200-inch (5.1 m) reflector [Hale Telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hale_Telescope "Hale Telescope") at the [Palomar Observatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palomar_Observatory "Palomar Observatory") near San Diego, California.

Hubble also worked as a civilian for [United States Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army "United States Army") at [Aberdeen Proving Ground](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aberdeen_Proving_Ground "Aberdeen Proving Ground") in Maryland during [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II") as the Chief of the External Ballistics Branch of the [Ballistic Research Laboratory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistic_Research_Laboratory "Ballistic Research Laboratory") during which he directed a large volume of research in exterior [ballistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistics "Ballistics") which increased the effective firepower of bombs and projectiles. His work was facilitated by his personal development of several items of equipment for the instrumentation used in exterior ballistics, the most outstanding development being the high-speed clock camera, which made possible the study of the characteristics of bombs and low-velocity projectiles in flight. The results of his studies were credited with improving design, performance, and military effectiveness of bombs and rockets. For his work there, he received the [Legion of Merit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legion_of_Merit "Legion of Merit") award.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble#cite_note-24)

### Universe goes beyond the Milky Way galaxy

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Edwin_Hubble&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Universe goes beyond the Milky Way galaxy")]

[![Image 4](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/100inchHooker.jpg/330px-100inchHooker.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:100inchHooker.jpg)

The 100-inch (2.5 m) [Hooker telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Wilson_Observatory#100-inch_Hooker_telescope "Mount Wilson Observatory") at Mount Wilson Observatory that Hubble used to measure galaxy distances and a value for the rate of [expansion of the universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansion_of_the_universe "Expansion of the universe").

Edwin Hubble's arrival at Mount Wilson Observatory, California, in 1919 coincided roughly with the completion of the 100-inch (2.5 m) [Hooker Telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Wilson_Observatory#100-inch_Hooker_telescope "Mount Wilson Observatory"), then the world's largest. At that time, the prevailing view of the cosmos was that the universe consisted entirely of the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way "Milky Way") galaxy.

Hubble's [classification scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_sequence "Hubble sequence")

Using the Hooker Telescope at [Mount Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Wilson_Observatory "Mount Wilson Observatory"), Hubble identified [Cepheid variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cepheid_variable "Cepheid variable"), a [standard candle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_distance_ladder#Standard_candles "Cosmic distance ladder") discovered by [Henrietta Swan Leavitt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Swan_Leavitt "Henrietta Swan Leavitt").[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble#cite_note-Henrietta-7) Comparing their [apparent luminosity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_magnitude "Apparent magnitude") to their intrinsic luminosity gives their distance from Earth.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble#cite_note-25)[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble#cite_note-26) Hubble found Cepheids in several [nebulae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_galaxy#Spiral_nebula "Spiral galaxy"), including the [Andromeda Nebula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy "Andromeda Galaxy") and [Triangulum Nebula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangulum_Galaxy "Triangulum Galaxy"). His observations, made in 1924, proved conclusively that these nebulae were much too distant to be part of the Milky Way and were, in fact, entire galaxies outside the Milky Way galaxy; thus, today they are no longer considered [nebulae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebula "Nebula").

This was first [hypothesized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis "Hypothesis") as early as 1755 when [Immanuel Kant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant "Immanuel Kant")'s _General History of Nature and Theory of the Heavens_ appeared. Hubble's hypothesis [was opposed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Debate_(astronomy) "Great Debate (astronomy)") by many in the astronomy establishment of the time, in particular by [Harvard University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University "Harvard University")–based [Harlow Shapley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlow_Shapley#The_Great_Debate_of_1920 "Harlow Shapley"). Despite the opposition, Hubble, then a thirty-five-year-old scientist, had his findings first published in _[The New York Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_New\_York\_Times "The New York Times")_ on November 23, 1924,[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble#cite_note-SharovNovikov1993-27) then presented them to other astronomers at the January 1, 1925, meeting of the [American Astronomical Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Astronomical_Society "American Astronomical Society").[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble#cite_note-MB2-28) Hubble's results for the Andromeda galaxy were not formally published in a [peer-reviewed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_review "Peer review")[scientific journal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_journal "Scientific journal") until 1929.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble#cite_note-29)

Hubble's findings fundamentally changed the scientific view of the universe. Supporters state that Hubble's discovery of nebulae outside of our galaxy helped pave the way for future astronomers.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble#cite_note-30) Although some of his more renowned colleagues simply scoffed at his results, Hubble published his findings. This published work earned him an award titled the American Association Prize and five hundred dollars from Burton E. Livingston of the Committee on Awards.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble#cite_note-Gale_E._Christianson_1996-16)

Hubble also devised the most commonly used [system for classifying galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_morphological_classification "Galaxy morphological classification"), grouping them according to their appearance in photographic images. He arranged the different groups of galaxies in what became known as the Hubble sequence.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble#cite_note-31)

### Redshift increases with distance

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Edwin_Hubble&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Redshift increases with distance")]

Hubble went on to estimate the distances to 24 extra-galactic nebulae, using a variety of methods. In 1929, Hubble examined the relationship between these distances and their [radial velocities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radial_velocity "Radial velocity") as determined from their [redshifts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift "Redshift"). All of his estimated distances are now known to be too small, by up to a factor of about 7. This was due to factors such as the fact that there are two kinds of Cepheid variables or confusing bright gas clouds with bright stars.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble#cite_note-Kirshner-32) However, his distances were more or less proportional to the true distances, and combining his distances with measurements of the redshifts of the galaxies by [Vesto Slipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vesto_Slipher "Vesto Slipher"), and by his assistant [Milton L. Humason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_L._Humason "Milton L. Humason"), he found a roughly linear relationship between the distances of the galaxies and their radial velocities (corrected for solar motion),[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble#cite_note-Hubbles_Law-11) a discovery that later became known as Hubble's law.

This meant that the greater the distance between any two galaxies, the greater their relative speed of separation. When interpreted that way, Hubble's measurements on 46 galaxies lead to a value for the [Hubble constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble%27s_law "Hubble's law") of 500 km/s/Mpc, which is much higher than the currently accepted values of 74 km/s/Mpc[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble#cite_note-gaiariess2018-33)[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble#cite_note-guardianhubbleconstant-34) (cosmic distance ladder method) or 68 km/s/Mpc[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble#cite_note-2018planckcosmos-35)[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble#cite_note-36) ([CMB method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background "Cosmic microwave background")) due to errors in their distance calibrations.

Yet the reason for the redshift remained unclear. Georges Lemaître predicted on theoretical grounds based on Einstein's equations for [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity") the [redshift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift "Redshift")-distance relation, and published observational support for it, two years before the discovery of Hubble's law.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble#cite_note-nature.com-37) Although he used the term "velocities" in his paper (and "apparent radial velocities" in the introduction), he later expressed doubt about interpreting these as real velocities. In 1931, he wrote a letter to the Dutch cosmologist [Willem de Sitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willem_de_Sitter "Willem de Sitter") expressing his opinion on the theoretical interpretation of the redshift-distance relation:[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble#cite_note-Kirshner-32)

> Mr. Humason and I are both deeply sensible of your gracious appreciation of the papers on velocities and distances of nebulae. We use the term 'apparent' velocities to emphasize the empirical features of the correlation. The interpretation, we feel, should be left to you and the very few others who are competent to discuss the matter with authority.

Today, the "apparent velocities" in question are usually thought of as an increase in [proper distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comoving_and_proper_distances "Comoving and proper distances") that occurs due to the [expansion of the universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansion_of_the_universe "Expansion of the universe"). Light traveling through an expanding metric will experience a Hubble-type redshift, a mechanism somewhat different from the [Doppler effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_effect "Doppler effect"), although the two mechanisms become equivalent descriptions related by a [coordinate transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_system#Transformations "Coordinate system") for nearby galaxies.

In the 1930s, Hubble was involved in determining the distribution of galaxies and [spatial curvature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shape_of_the_universe "Shape of the universe"). These data seemed to indicate that the universe was [flat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry "Euclidean geometry") and homogeneous, but there was a deviation from flatness at large redshifts. According to [Allan Sandage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_Sandage "Allan Sandage"),

> Hubble believed that his count data gave a more reasonable result concerning spatial curvature if the redshift correction was made assuming no recession. To the very end of his writings, he maintained this position, favouring (or at the very least keeping open) the model where no true expansion exists, and therefore that the redshift "represents a hitherto unrecognized principle of nature."[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble#cite_note-38)

There were methodological problems with Hubble's survey technique that showed a deviation from flatness at large redshifts. In particular, the technique did not account for changes in luminosity of galaxies due to [galaxy evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_formation_and_evolution "Galaxy formation and evolution"). Earlier, in 1917, [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein") had found that his newly developed theory of general relativity indicated that the universe must be either expanding or contracting. Unable to believe what his own equations were telling him, Einstein introduced a [cosmological constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_constant "Cosmological constant") (a"[fudge factor](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fudge_factor "wiktionary:fudge factor")") to the equations to avoid this "problem". When Einstein learned of Hubble's redshifts, he immediately realized that the expansion predicted by general relativity must be real, and in later life, he said that changing his equations was "the biggest blunder of [his] life".[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble#cite_note-39) Einstein visited Mount Wilson Observatory in 1931, and met Hubble. Einstein announced there that "the visit had changed his mind".[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble#cite_note-40)[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble#cite_note-41)

Hubble also discovered the [asteroid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid "Asteroid")[1373 Cincinnati](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1373_Cincinnati "1373 Cincinnati") on August 30, 1935. In 1936 he wrote _The Observational Approach to Cosmology_ and _The Realm of the Nebulae_ which explained his approaches to extra-galactic astronomy and his view of the subject's history.

In December 1941, Hubble reported to the [American Association for the Advancement of Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Science "American Association for the Advancement of Science") that results from a six-year survey with the Mount Wilson telescope did not support the expanding universe theory. According to a _Los Angeles Times_ article reporting on Hubble's remarks, "The nebulae could not be uniformly distributed, as the telescope shows they are, and still fit the explosion idea. Explanations which try to get around what the great telescope sees, he said, fail to stand up. The explosion, for example, would have had to start long after the earth was created, and possibly even after the first life appeared here."[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble#cite_note-LATimes-42)[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble#cite_note-Harnisch-43) (Hubble's estimate of what we now call the Hubble constant would put the Big Bang only 2 billion years ago.)

Hubble married Grace Lillian (Burke) Leib (1889–1980), daughter of John Patrick and Luella (Kepford) Burke, on February 26, 1924.

Hubble was raised as a Protestant Christian, but some of his later statements suggest uncertainty.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble#cite_note-44)[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble#cite_note-45)[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble#cite_note-46)

### Health issues and death

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Edwin_Hubble&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Health issues and death")]

Hubble had a heart attack in July 1949 while on vacation in [Colorado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado "Colorado"). He was cared for by his wife and continued on a modified diet and work schedule. He died of [cerebral thrombosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombus "Thrombus") (a blood clot in his brain) on September 28, 1953, in [San Marino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Marino,_California "San Marino, California"), California. No funeral was held for him, and his wife never revealed his burial site.[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble#cite_note-47)[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble#cite_note-PK-48)[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble#cite_note-49)

Hubble's papers comprising the bulk of his correspondence, photographs, notebooks, observing logbooks, and other materials, are held by the [Huntington Library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntington_Library "Huntington Library") in San Marino, California. They were donated by his wife Grace Burke Hubble upon her death in 1980.[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble#cite_note-50)

### Accusations concerning Lemaître's priority

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Edwin_Hubble&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Accusations concerning Lemaître's priority")]

In 2011, the journal [_Nature_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_(journal) "Nature (journal)") reported claims that Hubble might have played a role in the [redaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redaction "Redaction") of key parts of the 1931 English translation of [Lemaître's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Lema%C3%AEtre "Georges Lemaître") 1927 paper, which formulated what was later called Hubble's law and also gave observational evidence. Historians quoted in the article were skeptical that the redactions were part of a campaign to ensure Hubble retained priority. However, the observational astronomer [Sidney van den Bergh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidney_van_den_Bergh "Sidney van den Bergh") published a paper[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble#cite_note-Bergh-51) suggesting that while the omissions may have been made by a translator, they may still have been deliberate.

In November 2011, the astronomer [Mario Livio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Livio "Mario Livio") reported in _Nature_ that a letter he found in the Lemaître archive demonstrated that the redaction had been made by Lemaître himself, who apparently saw no point in publishing scientific content which had already been reported in 1929 by Hubble.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble#cite_note-nature.com-37) However, the fact remains that Lemaître published the law[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble#cite_note-52) in French, two years prior to Hubble.

### Campaign to obtain a Nobel Prize

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Edwin_Hubble&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Campaign to obtain a Nobel Prize")]

During Hubble's life the [Nobel Prize in Physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Physics "Nobel Prize in Physics") did not cover astronomy. Hubble spent much of the later part of his career attempting to have astronomy considered part of physics, instead of being a separate science. He did this largely so that astronomers—including himself—could be recognized by the [Nobel Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Committee "Nobel Committee") for their contributions to [astrophysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics "Astrophysics"). This campaign was unsuccessful in Hubble's lifetime, but shortly after his death, the Nobel Prize Committee decided that astronomical work would be eligible for the physics prize.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble#cite_note-Gale_E._Christianson_1996-16) However, the Nobel prize is not awarded posthumously.

On March 6, 2008, the [United States Postal Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Postal_Service "United States Postal Service") released a 41-cent stamp honoring Hubble on a sheet titled "American Scientists" designed by artist [Victor Stabin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Stabin "Victor Stabin").[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble#cite_note-PK-48) His citation reads:[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble#cite_note-63)

> Often called a "pioneer of the distant stars", astronomer Edwin Hubble (1889–1953) played a pivotal role in deciphering the vast and complex nature of the universe. His meticulous studies of spiral nebulae proved the existence of galaxies other than our own Milky Way. Had he not died suddenly in 1953, Hubble would have won that year's Nobel Prize in Physics.

(The assertion that he would have won the Nobel Prize in 1953 is likely false, although he was nominated for the prize that year.[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble#cite_note-64))

The other scientists on the "American Scientists" sheet include [Gerty Cori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerty_Cori "Gerty Cori"), biochemist; [Linus Pauling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Pauling "Linus Pauling"), chemist, and [John Bardeen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bardeen "John Bardeen"), physicist.

One morning, while driving north with Grace after the failed eclipse expedition of 1923, he broached Whitehead's idea of a God who might have chosen from a great many possibilities to make a different universe, but He made this one. By contemplating the universe, one might approximate some idea of its Creator. As time passed, however, he seemed even less certain: "We do not know why we are born into the world, but we can try to find out what sort of a world it is – at least in its physical aspects." His life was dedicated to science and the objective world of phenomena. The world of pure values is one which science cannot enter, and science is unconcerned with the transcendent, however, compelling a private revelation or individual moment of ecstasy. He pulled no punches when a deeply depressed friend asked him about his belief: "The whole thing is so much bigger than I am, and I can't understand it, so I just trust myself to it, and forget about it."

John terribly depressed, and asked Edwin about his belief. Edwin said, "The whole thing is so much bigger than I am, and I can't understand it, so I just trust myself to it, and forget about it." It was not his nature to speculate. Theories, in his opinion, were an appropriate cocktail conversation. He was essentially an observer, and as he said in The Realm of the Nebulae: "Not until the empirical resources are exhausted, need we pass on to the dreamy realms of speculation." Edwin never exhausted those empirical resources. "I am an observer, not a theoretical man," he attested, and a lightly spoken word in a lecture or in a letter showed that observation was his choice.
