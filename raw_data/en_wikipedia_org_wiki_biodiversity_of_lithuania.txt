[ d ] It is one of three Baltic states and lies on the eastern shore of the Baltic Sea , bordered by Latvia to the north, Belarus to the east and south, Poland to the south, and the Russian semi-exclave of Kaliningrad Oblast to the southwest, with a maritime border with Sweden to the west. Lithuania covers an area of 65,300 km 2 (25,200 sq mi), with a population of 2.9 million. Its capital and largest city is Vilnius ; other major cities include Kaunas , Klaipėda , Šiauliai and Panevėžys .

Lithuanians are the titular nation , belong to the ethnolinguistic group of Balts , and speak Lithuanian .

For millennia, the southeastern shores of the Baltic Sea were inhabited by various Baltic tribes . In the 1230s, Lithuanian lands were united for the first time by Mindaugas , who formed the Kingdom of Lithuania on 6 July 1253. Subsequent expansion and consolidation resulted in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania , which by the 14th century was the largest country in Europe. In 1386, the grand duchy entered into a de facto personal union with the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland . The two realms were united into the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1569, forming one of the largest and most prosperous states in Europe. The commonwealth lasted more than two centuries, until neighbouring countries gradually dismantled it between 1772 and 1795, with the Russian Empire annexing most of Lithuania's territory.

Towards the end of World War I , Lithuania declared independence in 1918, founding the modern Republic of Lithuania. In World War II , Lithuania was occupied by the Soviet Union , then by Nazi Germany , before being reoccupied by the Soviets in 1944.

Lithuanian armed resistance to the Soviet occupation lasted until the early 1950s. On 11 March 1990, a year before the formal dissolution of the Soviet Union , Lithuania became the first Soviet republic to break away when it proclaimed the restoration of its independence .

Lithuania is a developed country with a high-income and an advanced economy ranking very high in Human Development Index . Lithuania ranks highly in digital infrastructure , [ 25 ] [ 26 ] press freedom and happiness .

[ 27 ] It is a member of the United Nations , the European Union , the Council of Europe , the Council of the Baltic Sea States , the Eurozone , the Nordic Investment Bank , the International Monetary Fund , the Schengen Agreement , NATO , OECD and the World Trade Organization . It also participates in the Nordic-Baltic Eight (NB8) regional co-operation format.

Etymology [ edit ] Main article: Name of Lithuania Earliest mention of Lithuania ( Litua , on line 7) in the entry for 1009 in the 11th-century Annals of Quedlinburg , Dresden, Sächsische Landesbibliothek, Q.113, fol 31r.

The spelling of Lithuania was a later addition to the original Latinate Lituania since 1800 as a form of hyperforeignism influenced by Greek loanwords with the theta ; it is ultimately from Lithuanian : Lietuva .

[ 28 ] The first known record of Lietuva is in a 1009 story of Saint Bruno in the Annals of Quedlinburg .

[ 29 ] The chronicle records Latinized form of the name Lietuva: Litua .

[ 30 ] The true meaning of the name is unknown, and scholars still debate it. There are a few plausible versions.

[ 31 ] Lietava , a small stream near Kernavė —the core area of the early Lithuanian state and a possible first capital of the eventual Grand Duchy of Lithuania —is usually credited as the source of the name.

[ 32 ] However, the stream is very small, and some find it improbable that such a small and localized body of water could have lent its name to an entire nation. On the other hand, such naming is not unprecedented in world history.

[ 33 ] Artūras Dubonis proposed another hypothesis, [ 34 ] that Lietuva relates to the word leičiai (plural of leitis ). From the middle of the 13th century, leičiai were a distinct warrior social group of the Lithuanian society subordinate to the Lithuanian ruler or the state itself. The word leičiai is used in 14–16th century historical sources as an ethnonym for Lithuanians (but not Samogitians ) and is still used, usually poetically or in historical contexts, in the Latvian language , which is closely related to Lithuanian.

[ 35 ] [ 36 ] [ 37 ] History [ edit ] Main article: History of Lithuania Early history and Baltic tribes [ edit ] See also: Lithuanian land confederation Baltic amber was a valuable trade item, transported from the region of modern-day Lithuania to the Roman Empire through the Amber Road .

The history of Lithuania dates back to settlements founded about 10,000 years ago.

[ 38 ] [ 39 ] The first people settled in the territory of Lithuania after the Last Glacial Period in the 10th millennium BC: Kunda , Neman and Narva cultures .

[ 40 ] They were traveling hunters. In the 8th millennium BC the climate became warmer and forests developed. The inhabitants of what is now Lithuania travelled less and engaged in local hunting, gathering and fresh-water fishing. The Indo-Europeans , who arrived in the 3rd – 2nd millennium BC, mixed with the local population and formed various Baltic tribes.

[ 41 ] The Balts did not maintain close cultural or political contacts with the Roman Empire , [ 42 ] while maintaining trade contacts via the Amber Road .

From the 9th to the 11th centuries, coastal Balts were subjected to raids by the Vikings .

[ 43 ] Lithuania comprised mainly the culturally different regions of Samogitia (known for its early medieval skeletal burials), and further east Aukštaitija , or Lithuania proper (known for its early medieval cremation burials). The area was remote and unattractive to outsiders, including traders, which accounts for its separate linguistic, cultural and religious identity and delayed integration into general European patterns and trends.

[ 44 ] Traditional Lithuanian pagan customs and mythology , with many archaic elements, were long preserved. Rulers' bodies were cremated up until the conversion to Christianity.

[ 45 ] Kingdom of Lithuania, Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth [ edit ] Main articles: Duchy of Lithuania , Kingdom of Lithuania , and Grand Duchy of Lithuania Ancient Kernavė hillforts Trakai Island Castle , the former residence of the Grand Dukes .

Trakai was the capital of the medieval state.

Changes in the territory of Lithuania from the 13th to 15th century. At its peak, Lithuania was the largest state in Europe.

[ 46 ] [ 47 ] The first written record of the name for the country dates back to 1009 AD.

[ 48 ] Facing the German threat , Mindaugas in the middle of the 13th century united a large part of the Baltic tribes and founded the State of Lithuania, while in 1253 he was crowned as the Catholic King of Lithuania .

[ 49 ] [ 50 ] Moreover by taking advantage of the weakened territory of the former Kievan Rus' due to the Mongol invasion , Mindaugas incorporated Black Ruthenia into Lithuania.

[ 49 ] After Mindaugas' assassination in 1263, pagan Lithuania was again a target of the Christian crusades of the Teutonic Order and Livonian Order .

[ 51 ] Traidenis during his reign (1269–1282) reunified all Lithuanian lands and achieved military successes against the crusaders, fighting alongside other Baltic tribes, but was unable to militarily assist the Old Prussians in their Great Uprising .

[ 52 ] Traidenis' main residence was in Kernavė .

[ 52 ] From the late 13th century members of the Gediminids dynasty began ruling Lithuania. Grand Duke Gediminas consolidated a hereditary monarchy and established Vilnius as the capital city in his letters .

Lithuania was christianized and incorporated East Slavs ' territories (e.g. principalities of Minsk , Kyiv , Polotsk , Vitebsk , Smolensk , etc.) significantly expanding the Grand Duchy of Lithuania 's territory, expanding to ~650,000 km2 in the first half of the 14th century.

[ 53 ] At the end of the 14th century Lithuania was the largest country in Europe .

[ 46 ] [ 47 ] In 1385, Lithuania formed a dynastic union with Poland through the Union of Krewo .

[ 53 ] By the 15th century patrilineal members of the Lithuanian ruling Gediminids dynasty ruled Lithuania and Poland, as well as Hungary , Croatia , Bohemia , and Moldavia .

[ 54 ] [ 55 ] Wars with the Teutonic State in 1409-1411 and in 1422 concluded with the Treaty of Melno .

[ 53 ] In the 15th century the strengthened Grand Duchy of Moscow renewed the Muscovite–Lithuanian Wars for the Lithuanian-controlled Eastern Orthodox territories.

[ 53 ] Due to the unsuccessful beginning of the Livonian War , loss of land to the Tsardom of Russia , and pressure by monarch Sigismund II Augustus (a supporter of a close Polish–Lithuanian union), the Lithuanian nobility agreed to conclude the Union of Lublin in 1569 with the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland , which created the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth with a joint monarch, but Lithuania remained a separate state.

[ 56 ] [ 53 ] After concluding the real union , Lithuania and Poland jointly managed to reach military successes during the Livonian War, occupation of Moscow (1610), war with Sweden (1600–1611) , Smolensk war with Russia (1632–1634) , etc.

[ 53 ] [ 56 ] In 1588, Sigismund III Vasa personally confirmed the Third Statute of Lithuania where it was stated that Lithuania and Poland have equal rights within the Commonwealth and ensured the separation of powers .

[ 57 ] The real union strongly intensified the Polonization of Lithuania and Lithuanian nobility.

[ 58 ] The mid-17th century was marked with disastrous military loses for Lithuania as during the Deluge most of the territory of Lithuania was annexed by the Tsardom of Russia, and Vilnius was captured for the first time by a foreign army and ravaged.

[ 59 ] In 1655, Lithuania unilaterally seceded from Poland , declared Swedish King Charles X Gustav as the Grand Duke of Lithuania and fell under the protection of the Swedish Empire .

[ 60 ] However, by 1657 Lithuania was once again a part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth following the Lithuanian revolt against the Swedes.

[ 61 ] Vilnius was recaptured from the Russians in 1661.

[ 62 ] In the second half of the 18th century the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was three times partitioned by three neighboring countries which completely dissoluted both independent Lithuania and Poland from the political map in 1795 after a failed Kościuszko Uprising and short-lived recapture of Vilnius in 1794.

[ 53 ] Most of Lithuania's territory was annexed by the Russian Empire , while Užnemunė [ lt ] was annexed by Prussia .

[ 53 ] Efforts to restore statehood [ edit ] Emilia Plater leading peasant scythemen during the 1831 Uprising against the Russian Empire; often nicknamed as a Lithuanian Joan of Arc [ 63 ] Following the annexation the Russian Tsarist authorities implemented Russification policies in Lithuania, which then made a part of a new administrative region Northwestern Krai .

[ 64 ] In 1812 Napoleon during the French invasion of Russia established the puppet Lithuanian Provisional Governing Commission to support his war efforts. After Napoleon's defeat the Russian rule was reinstated in Lithuania.

[ 64 ] During the November Uprising (1830–1831) the Lithuanians and Poles jointly attempted to restore their statehoods, however the Russian victory resulted in stricter Russification measures: the Russian language was introduced in all government institutions, Vilnius University was closed in 1832, and theories that Lithuania had been a "Western Russian" state since its establishment were propagated.

[ 64 ] Subsequently, the Lithuanians once again tried to restore statehood by participating in the January Uprising (1863–1864), but yet another Russian victory resulted in even stronger Russification policies with the introduction of the Lithuanian press ban , pressure on the Catholic Church in Lithuania and Mikhail Muravyov-Vilensky 's repressions.

[ 64 ] [ 65 ] Lithuanians resisted Russification through an extensive network of Lithuanian book smugglers , secret Lithuanian publishing and homeschooling.

[ 66 ] Moreover, the Lithuanian National Revival , inspired by Lithuanian history, language and culture, laid the foundations for the reestablishment of an independent Lithuania.

[ 67 ] The Great Seimas of Vilnius was held in 1905 and its participants adopted resolutions which demanded a wide autonomy for Lithuania.

[ 64 ] Restored statehood and occupations [ edit ] See also: Occupation of the Baltic states and Guerrilla war in the Baltic states Members of the Council of Lithuania after signing the Act of Independence of Lithuania in the House of the Signatories in 1918 Lithuanian Armed Forces returning to Vilnius in 1939 During World War I the German Empire annexed Lithuanian territories from the Russian Empire and they became a part of Ober Ost .

[ 68 ] In 1917, the Lithuanians organized the Vilnius Conference which adopted a resolution, featuring the aspiration for the restoration of Lithuania's sovereignty and military alliance with Germany and elected the Council of Lithuania .

[ 68 ] In 1918, the short-lived Kingdom of Lithuania was proclaimed; however on 16 February 1918 the Council of Lithuania adopted the Act of Independence of Lithuania which restored Lithuania as a democratic republic with its capital in Vilnius and without any political ties that existed with other nations in the past.

[ 68 ] In 1918–1920 Lithuanians defended the statehood of Lithuania against Bolsheviks , Bermontians and Poles during the Lithuanian Wars of Independence .

[ 68 ] The aims of the newly restored Lithuania clashed with Józef Piłsudski 's plans to create a federation ( Intermarium ) in territories previously ruled by the Jagiellonians .

[ 69 ] The Lithuanian authorities prevented the 1919 Polish coup attempt in Lithuania , and in 1920 during the Żeligowski's Mutiny the Polish forces captured Vilnius Region and established a puppet state of the Republic of Central Lithuania , which in 1922 was incorporated into Poland.

[ 68 ] Consequently, Kaunas became the temporary capital of Lithuania where the Constituent Assembly of Lithuania was held and other primary Lithuanian institutions operated until 1940.

[ 70 ] In 1923, the Klaipėda Revolt was organized which unified the Klaipėda Region with Lithuania.

[ 71 ] The 1926 Lithuanian coup d'état replaced the democratically elected government and president with an authoritarian regime led by Antanas Smetona .

[ 71 ] In the late 1930s Lithuania accepted the 1938 Polish ultimatum , 1939 German ultimatum and transferred the Klaipėda Region to Nazi Germany . The 1939 Soviet–Lithuanian Mutual Assistance Treaty allowed the presence of Soviet troops in Lithuania.

[ 72 ] In 1940 Lithuania accepted the Soviet ultimatum and recovered the control of its historical capital Vilnius, however, the acceptance resulted in the Soviet occupation of Lithuania and its transformation into the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic .

[ 72 ] In 1941 during the June Uprising in Lithuania it was attempted to restore independent Lithuania and the Red Army was expelled from its territory, however in a few days Lithuania was occupied by Nazi Germany .

[ 72 ] In 1944 Lithuania was re-occupied by the Soviet Union , and Soviet political repressions along with Soviet deportations from Lithuania resumed.

[ 72 ] Thousands of Lithuanian partisans and their supporters attempted to militarily restore independent Lithuania, but their resistance was eventually suppressed in 1953 by the Soviet authorities and their collaborators .

[ 72 ] Jonas Žemaitis , the chairman of the Union of Lithuanian Freedom Fighters , was captured and executed in 1954, his successor as chairman Adolfas Ramanauskas was brutally tortured and executed in 1957.

[ 73 ] [ 74 ] Since the late 1980s Sąjūdis movement sought for the restoration of independent Lithuania, and in 1989 the Baltic Way was held.

[ 72 ] 1990–present [ edit ] Main article: Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania See also: Singing Revolution On 11 March 1990, the Supreme Council announced the restoration of Lithuania's independence .

[ 75 ] After refusal to revoke the Act, Soviet forces stormed the Seimas Palace while Lithuanians defended the democratically elected Council. The Act, the first such declaration in the USSR, later was a model and inspiration to other Soviet republics , and strongly influenced the dissolution of the Soviet Union .

On 11 March 1990, the Supreme Council announced the restoration of Lithuania's independence. Lithuania became the first Soviet-occupied state to announce the restitution of independence.

[ 76 ] On 20 April 1990, the Soviets imposed an economic blockade by ceasing to deliver raw materials to Lithuania.

[ 77 ] Domestic industry and the population started feeling the lack of fuel, essential goods, and even hot water. Although the blockade lasted for 74 days, Lithuania did not renounce its declaration of independence.

[ 78 ] Gradually, economic relations were restored. However, tensions peaked again in January 1991. Attempts were made to carry out a coup using the Soviet Armed Forces , the Internal Army of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the USSR Committee for State Security ( KGB ). Because of the poor economic situation in Lithuania, the forces in Moscow thought the coup d'état would receive strong public support.

[ 79 ] People flooded to Vilnius to defend the Supreme Council of the Republic of Lithuania and independence. The coup ended with a few casualties and material loss. The Soviet Army killed 14 people and injured hundreds. A large part of the Lithuanian population participated in the January Events .

[ 80 ] [ 81 ] [ 78 ] On 31 July 1991, Soviet paramilitaries killed 7 Lithuanian border guards on the Belarusian border in what became known as the Medininkai Massacre .

[ 78 ] On 17 September, Lithuania was admitted to the United Nations .

[ 78 ] On 25 October 1992, citizens voted in a referendum to adopt the current constitution .

[ 78 ] On 14 February 1993, during the direct general elections, Algirdas Brazauskas became the first president after the restoration of independence.

[ 78 ] On 31 August 1993 the last units of the former Soviet Army left Lithuania.

[ 82 ] On 31 May 2001, Lithuania joined the World Trade Organization .

[ 83 ] Since March 2004, Lithuania has been part of NATO .

[ 84 ] On 1 May 2004, it became a full member of the European Union , [ 85 ] and a member of the Schengen Agreement in December 2007.

[ 86 ] On 1 January 2015, Lithuania joined the eurozone and adopted the European Union's single currency.

[ 87 ] On 4 July 2018, Lithuania officially joined the OECD .

[ 88 ] On 24 February 2022, Lithuania declared a state of emergency in response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine .

[ 89 ] Together with seven other NATO member states, it invoked NATO Article 4 to hold consultations on security.

[ 90 ] Geography [ edit ] Main article: Geography of Lithuania Physical map and geomorphological subdivision of Lithuania Lithuania is located in the Baltic region of Europe [ d ] and covers an area of 65,300 km 2 (25,200 sq mi).

[ 91 ] It lies between latitudes 53° and 57° N , and mostly between longitudes 21° and 27° E (part of the Curonian Spit lies west of 21°). It has around 99 kilometres (61.5 mi) of sandy coastline, with around 38 kilometres (24 mi) facing the open Baltic Sea . The rest of the coast is sheltered by the Curonian sand peninsula. The warm-water port at Klaipėda lies at the narrow mouth of the Curonian Lagoon (Lithuanian: Kuršių marios ), a shallow lagoon extending south to Kaliningrad . The country's main and largest river, the Nemunas River , and some of its tributaries carry international shipping.

Lithuania lies at the edge of the North European Plain . Its landscape was smoothed by the glaciers of the last ice age , and is a combination of moderate lowlands and highlands. Its highest point is Aukštojas Hill at 294 metres (965 ft) in the eastern part of the country. The terrain features numerous lakes and wetlands, and a mixed forest zone covers over 33% of the country.

Drūkšiai is the largest lake, Tauragnas is the deepest lake, and Asveja is the longest lake in Lithuania.

After a re-estimation of the boundaries of the European continent in 1989, Jean-George Affholder, a scientist at the Institut Géographique National (French National Geographic Institute), determined that the geographic centre of Europe was in Lithuania, at 54°54′N 25°19′E ﻿ / ﻿ 54.900°N 25.317°E ﻿ / 54.900; 25.317 ﻿ ( Purnuškės (centre of gravity) ) , 26 kilometres (16 mi) north of Vilnius.

[ 92 ] Affholder accomplished this by calculating the centre of gravity of the geometrical figure of Europe.

Climate [ edit ] Main article: Geography of Lithuania § Climate Lithuania has a temperate climate with both maritime and continental influences. It is defined as humid continental (Dfb) under the Köppen climate classification (but is close to oceanic in a narrow coastal zone).

Average temperatures on the coast are −2.5 °C (27.5 °F) in January and 16 °C (61 °F) in July. In Vilnius, the average temperatures are −6 °C (21 °F) in January and 17 °C (63 °F) in July. During the summer, 20 °C (68 °F) is common during the day, while 14 °C (57 °F) is common at night; in the past, temperatures have reached as high as 30 or 35 °C (86 or 95 °F). Some winters can be very cold. −20 °C (−4 °F) occurs almost every winter. Winter extremes are −34 °C (−29 °F) in coastal areas and −43 °C (−45 °F) in the east.

The average annual precipitation is 800 mm (31.5 in) on the coast, 900 mm (35.4 in) in the Samogitia highlands, and 600 mm (23.6 in) in the east. Snow occurs every year, and it can snow from October to April. In some years, sleet can fall in September or May. The growing season lasts 202 days in the western part of the country and 169 days in the eastern part. Severe storms are rare in the east but common in the coastal areas. Lithuania experienced a drought in 2002, causing forest and peat bog fires.

[ 93 ] Biodiversity and conservation [ edit ] Main articles: Fauna of Lithuania , Flora of Lithuania , and Protected areas of Lithuania Lithuanian flatlands with lakes, swamps and forests. Lithuania has thousands of lakes.

Sand dunes of the Curonian Spit near Nida , which are the highest drifting sand dunes in Europe ( UNESCO World Heritage Site ) [ 94 ] The Aplinkos apsaugos įstatymas (Environmental Protection Act) was adopted in 1992. The law provides the foundations for regulating social relations in the field of environmental protection, establishes the basic rights and obligations of legal and natural persons in preserving the biodiversity, ecological systems, and the landscape.

[ 95 ] Lithuania agreed to cut carbon emissions by at least 20% of 1990 levels by 2020 and by at least 40% by 2030, together with all European Union members. Also, by 2020 at least 20% (27% by 2030) of the country's total energy consumption should be from the renewable energy sources.

[ 96 ] In 2016, Lithuania introduced especially effective container deposit legislation , which resulted in collecting 92% of all packagings in 2017.

[ 97 ] Lithuania does not have high mountains, and its landscape is dominated by blooming meadows, dense forests and fertile fields of cereals. However, it stands out by the abundance of hillforts , which previously had castles where the ancient Lithuanians burned altars for pagan gods.

[ 98 ] Lithuania is a particularly watered region with more than 3,000 lakes, mostly in the northeast. The country is also drained by numerous rivers, most notably the longest Nemunas .

[ 98 ] Lithuania is home to two terrestrial ecoregions: Central European mixed forests and Sarmatic mixed forests .

[ 99 ] Forest has long been one of the most important natural resources. Forests occupy one-third of the territory, and timber-related industrial production accounts for almost 11% of industrial production.

[ 100 ] There are five national parks , [ 101 ] 30 regional parks , [ 102 ] 402 nature reserves, [ 103 ] 6 strict nature reserves , [ 104 ] and 668 state-protected natural heritage objects.

[ 105 ] The white stork is the national bird of Lithuania, which has the highest-density stork population in Europe.

[ 106 ] [ 107 ] Ecosystems include natural and semi-natural (forests, bogs , wetlands and meadows) and anthropogenic (agrarian and urban) ecosystems. Among natural ecosystems, forests are particularly important, covering 33% of the country's territory. Wetlands (raised bogs, fens , transitional mires, etc.) cover 7.9% of the country, with 70% of wetlands having been lost due to drainage and peat extraction between 1960 and 1980. Changes in wetland plant communities resulted in the replacement of moss and grass communities by trees and shrubs, and fens not directly affected by land reclamation have become drier as a result of a drop in the water table. There are 29,000 rivers with a total length of 64,000 km; the Nemunas River basin occupies 74% of the territory of the country. Due to the construction of dams, approximately 70% of spawning sites of potential catadromous fish species have disappeared. In some cases, river and lake ecosystems continue to be impacted by anthropogenic eutrophication .

[ 108 ] Agricultural land comprises 54% of Lithuania's territory (roughly 70% of that is arable land and 30% meadows and pastures), approximately 400,000 ha of agricultural land is not farmed and acts as an ecological niche for weeds and invasive plant species. Habitat deterioration is occurring in regions with very productive and expensive lands as crop areas are expanded. Currently, 18.9% of all plant species, including 1.87% of all known fungi species and 31% of all known species of lichens, are listed in the Lithuanian Red Data Book . The list also contains 8% of all fish species.

[ 108 ] The wildlife populations have rebounded as hunting became more restricted and urbanization allowed replanting forests (forests already tripled in size since their lows). Currently, Lithuania has approximately 250,000 larger wild animals or 5 per square kilometre. The most prolific large wild animal is the roe deer , with 120,000 of them. They are followed by boars (55,000). Other ungulates are the deer (~22,000), fallow-deer (~21,000) and the largest one: moose (~7,000). Among the predators, foxes are the most common (~27,000).

Wolves are, however, more ingrained into the mythology as there are just 800 in Lithuania. Even rarer are the lynxes (~200). There are about 200,000 rabbits in the forests.

[ 109 ] Government and politics [ edit ] Main article: Politics of Lithuania Seimas — Parliament of Lithuania Government [ edit ] Since Lithuania declared the restoration of its independence on 11 March 1990, it has maintained strong democratic traditions. It held its first independent general elections on 25 October 1992, in which 56.75% of voters supported the new constitution .

[ 110 ] There were intense debates concerning the constitution, particularly the role of the president. A separate referendum was held on 23 May 1992 to gauge public opinion on the matter, and 41% of voters supported the restoration of the President of Lithuania .

[ 110 ] Through compromise, a semi-presidential system was agreed on.

[ 4 ] Gitanas Nausėda , President since 2019 Gintautas Paluckas , Prime Minister since 2024 Saulius Skvernelis , Speaker of the Seimas since 2024 The Lithuanian head of state is the president, directly elected for a five-year term and serving a maximum of two terms. The president oversees foreign affairs and national security and is the commander-in-chief of the military.

[ 111 ] The president appoints the prime minister and the cabinet, as well as other top civil servants and the judges for all courts except the Constitutional Court .

[ 111 ] President Gitanas Nausėda was elected on 26 May 2019 by winning in all the municipalities of Lithuania in the second election round.

[ 112 ] He was re-elected in 2024, winning more than 74% of the run-off votes.

[ 113 ] The judges of the Constitutional Court ( Konstitucinis Teismas ) serve nine-year terms. One-third of the court members is renewed every three years. The judges are appointed by the Seimas on the nomination by the president, chairman of the Seimas, and the chairman of the Supreme Court . The unicameral Lithuanian parliament, the Seimas, has 141 members elected to four-year terms: 71 in single-member constituencies, and the others in a nationwide vote by proportional representation . A party must receive at least 5% of the national vote to be eligible for any of the 70 national seats in the Seimas.

[ 114 ] Political parties and elections [ edit ] Main article: Elections in Lithuania Lithuania exhibits a fragmented multi-party system, [ 115 ] with many small parties in which coalition governments are common. Elections for president take place on the last Sunday no more than two months before the end of current presidential term.

[ 116 ] Ordinary elections to the Seimas take place on the second Sunday of October every four years.

[ 114 ] The Social Democratic Party of Lithuania won the 2024 Lithuanian parliamentary elections and gained 52 of 141 seats in the parliament.

[ 117 ] In November 2024, Gintautas Paluckas was confirmed as the prime minister after the Social Democrats reached a coalition agreement with Union of Democrats "For Lithuania" and Dawn of Nemunas .

[ 118 ] Lithuania was one of the first countries in the world to grant women a right to vote in the elections. Women were allowed to vote by the 1918 Constitution of Lithuania and used their newly granted right for the first time in 1919.

[ 119 ] Commemoration of the Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania in the historical Seimas hall where it was originally signed in 1990. The ceremony is attended by the Lithuanian President, Prime Minister, Chairman of the Seimas and other high-ranking officials.

Each municipality is governed by a municipal council and a mayor, who is a member of the municipal council. The number of members, elected on a four-year term, in each municipal council depends on the size of the municipality and varies from 15 (in municipalities with fewer than 5,000 residents) to 51 (in municipalities with more than 500,000 residents). Members of the council, with the exception of the mayor, are elected using proportional representation. Starting with 2015, the mayor is elected directly by the majority of residents of the municipality.

[ 120 ] The Social Democratic Party of Lithuania won the most positions in the 2023 elections (358 municipal council seats and 17 mayors).

[ 121 ] As of 2024, the number of seats in the European Parliament allocated to Lithuania was 11.

[ 122 ] Ordinary elections take place on a Sunday on the same day as in other EU countries. Eight political parties gained seats in the 2024 elections .

[ 123 ] Law and law enforcement [ edit ] Main article: Law of Lithuania Statutes of Lithuania were the central piece of Lithuanian law in 1529–1795.

The first attempt to codify the Lithuanian laws was in 1468 when the Casimir's Code was compiled and adopted by Grand Duke Casimir IV Jagiellon .

[ 124 ] In the 16th century three editions of the Statutes of Lithuania were created with the First Statute being adopted in 1529, the Second Statute in 1566, and the Third Statute in 1588.

[ 124 ] On 3 May 1791, the Europe's first and the world's second constitution was adopted by the Great Sejm .

[ 125 ] The Third Statute was partly in force in the territory of Lithuania even until 1840, despite the Third Partition of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1795.

[ 124 ] In 1934–1935, Lithuania held the first mass trial of the Nazis in Europe ; the convicted were sentenced to imprisonment in a heavy labor prison and capital punishments.

[ 126 ] After regaining of independence in 1990, the largely modified Soviet legal codes were in force for about a decade. The current Constitution of Lithuania was adopted on 25 October 1992.

[ 127 ] In 2001, the Civil Code of Lithuania was passed in Seimas. It was succeeded by the Criminal Code and Criminal Procedure Code in 2003. The approach to the criminal law is inquisitorial, as opposed to adversarial; it is generally characterised by an insistence on formality and rationalisation, as opposed to practicality and informality. Normative legal act enters into force on the next day after its publication in the Teisės aktų registras , unless it has a later entry into force date.

[ 128 ] The European Union law is an integral part of the Lithuanian legal system since 1 May 2004.

[ 129 ] After breaking away from the Soviet Union, Lithuiana had a difficult crime situation, however, the law enforcement agencies fought crime over the years, making Lithuania a reasonably safe country.

[ 130 ] Crime in Lithuania has been declining rapidly.

[ 131 ] Law enforcement is primarily the responsibility of local Lietuvos policija (Lithuanian Police) commissariats. They are supplemented by the Lietuvos policijos antiteroristinių operacijų rinktinė Aras (Anti-Terrorist Operations Team of the Lithuanian Police Aras ), Lietuvos kriminalinės policijos biuras (Lithuanian Criminal Police Bureau), Lietuvos policijos kriminalistinių tyrimų centras (Lithuanian Police Forensic Research Center) and Lietuvos kelių policijos tarnyba (Lithuanian Road Police Service).

[ 132 ] In 2017, there were 63,846 crimes registered in Lithuania. Of these, thefts comprised a large part with 19,630 cases (13.2% less than in 2016). While 2,835 crimes were serious and very serious (crimes that may lead to more than six years imprisonment), which is 14.5% less than in 2016. In total, 129 homicides or attempted homicide occurred (19.9% less than in 2016), while serious bodily harm was registered 178 times (17.6% less than in 2016). Another problematic crime contraband cases also decreased by 27.2% from 2016. Meanwhile, crimes in electronic data and information technology security fields increased by 26.6%.

[ 133 ] In the 2024 Special Eurobarometer, 24% of Lithuanians said that corruption affects their daily lives (EU average 27%). Moreover, 83% of Lithuanians regarded corruption as widespread in their country (EU average 68%), and 78% agreed that bribery and the use of connections is often the easiest way of obtaining certain public services (EU average 63%).

[ 134 ] Capital punishment in Lithuania was suspended in 1996 and eliminated in 1998.

[ 135 ] Imprisonment rate in Lithuania is among the highest in the EU, although it has decreased by nearly half between 2013 and 2023.

[ 136 ] According to scientist Gintautas Sakalauskas, the high imprisonment rate is not because of a high criminality rate in the country, but due to Lithuania's high repression level and mistrust in the society.

[ 137 ] Administrative divisions [ edit ] Main article: Administrative divisions of Lithuania See also: Counties of Lithuania , Municipalities of Lithuania , Elderships of Lithuania , and Cultural regions of Lithuania Alytus County Kaunas County Klaipėda County Marijampolė County Panevėžys County Šiauliai County Tauragė County Telšiai County Utena County Vilnius County Baltic Sea Latvia Belarus Poland Russia Map of cultural regions of Lithuania divided by municipalities and elderships : Lithuania Minor (Mažoji Lietuva) Samogitia (Žemaitija) Highland (Aukštaitija) Dainava (Dzūkija) Sudovia (Suvalkija) The current system of administrative division was established in 1994 and modified in 2000 to meet the requirements of the European Union. The country's 10 counties (Lithuanian: singular – apskritis , plural – apskritys ) are subdivided into 60 municipalities (Lithuanian: singular – savivaldybė , plural – savivaldybės ), and further divided into 546 elderships (Lithuanian: singular – seniūnija , plural – seniūnijos ). There are also 5 distinct cultural regions – Dzūkija , Aukštaitija , Suvalkija , Samogitia and Lithuania Minor .

Municipalities have been the most important unit of administration since the system of county governorship ( apskrities viršininkas ) was dissolved in 2010.

[ 138 ] Some municipalities are historically called "district municipalities" (often shortened to "district"), while others are called "city municipalities" (sometimes shortened to "city"). Each has its own elected government. The election of municipality councils originally occurred every three years, but now takes place every four years. The council appoints elders to govern the elderships. Mayors have been directly elected since 2015; prior to that, they were appointed by the council.

[ 139 ] Elderships are the smallest administrative units and do not play a role in national politics. They provide necessary local public services—for example, registering births and deaths in rural areas. They are most active in the social sector, identifying needy individuals or families and organizing and distributing welfare and other forms of relief.

[ 140 ] Some citizens feel that elderships have no real power and receive too little attention, and that they could otherwise become a source of local initiative for addressing rural problems.

Five R&D Valleys were launched – Jūrinis (maritime technologies), Nemunas (agro, bioenergy, forestry), Saulėtekis (laser and light, semiconductor), Santara (biotechnology, medicine), Santaka (sustainable chemistry and pharmacy).

[ 231 ] Lithuanian Innovation Center was created to provide support for innovations and research institutions.

[ 232 ] Tourism [ edit ] Main article: Tourism in Lithuania Druskininkai is a popular spa town .

According to the World Travel and Tourism Council , the tourism sector contributed approximately €1.7 billion to the national economy in 2023, accounting for 2.3% of the country's GDP. This represents a notable recovery from the downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, although it remains below pre-pandemic levels.

[ 233 ] [ 234 ] In 2023, Lithuania welcomed over 1.1 million international visitors, marking a substantial recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic . Foreign tourists accounted for nearly a third of the total population. The majority of international tourists originated from neighboring countries, notably Belarus and Poland.

[ 235 ] Domestic tourism has also seen significant growth, with residents making around 12.8 million trips within the country in 2023. Most of these were same-day trips, totaling nearly 10 million.

[ 235 ] Key urban centres such as Vilnius, Kaunas, and Klaipėda attract numerous visitors because of their rich history and cultural offerings. Vilnius is renowned for its baroque architecture and has been recognized as the European Green Capital for 2025.

[ 236 ] Seaside resorts like Palanga and Neringa are popular for their sandy beaches and unique landscapes. Neringa, part of the Curonian Spit, is UNESCO 's World Heritage Site known for its colossal sand dunes and pine forests.

[ 237 ] Spa towns such as Druskininkai offer wellness retreats, with Druskininkai featuring the largest water park in Eastern Europe and the Snow Arena , one of the largest indoor skiing slopes in Europe.

[ 238 ] Lithuania offers diverse outdoor activities. Hot air ballooning is particularly popular in Vilnius and Trakai , providing aerial views of the historic landscapes. Cycling tourism is on the rise, with the country boasting over 3,769 km of bicycle tracks, including 1,988 km of asphalt pavement. The EuroVelo 10 (Baltic Sea Cycle Route) traverses the Curonian Spit, offering views of sand dunes and coastal towns like Palanga and Nida .

[ 237 ] The EuroVelo 11 (East Europe Route) passes through eastern Lithuania, including Vilnius and Trakai, and natural areas like Labanoras Regional Park .

[ 239 ] The Nemunas Delta Regional Park is a haven for birdwatchers, hosting over 300 bird species, including rare and endangered ones like the greater spotted eagle and aquatic warbler .

[ 240 ] The park's wetlands serve as crucial resting sites for migratory birds.

[ 241 ] Communication [ edit ] Lithuania has a modern, well-developed communications infrastructure. As of 2025, the country’s population is approximately 2.8 million, with over 5.5 million active SIM cards, giving a mobile penetration rate exceeding 190%.

[ 242 ] Mobile phone use is nearly universal, and smartphone adoption has surpassed 85% of the adult population, up from 50% in 2016.

[ 243 ] The rollout of 5G networks has progressed rapidly since 2022, with 5G services now covering more than 85% of Lithuania’s territory, including urban centers, highways, and key economic regions.

[ 244 ] The LTE (4G) network remains widespread, covering over 98% of the country and ensuring reliable connectivity even in rural areas.

[ 245 ] Internet access has become nearly ubiquitous, with 95% of Lithuanian households connected to broadband services as of 2025. This is a major improvement from 72% in 2017, [ 246 ] and well above the previously projected 77% for 2021.

[ 247 ] Lithuania now ranks among the EU leaders in fixed broadband penetration and average speeds, with average household download speeds exceeding 150 Mbps and mobile download speeds surpassing 100 Mbps.

[ 248 ] Usage of fixed phone lines has continued to decline sharply due to the widespread adoption of mobile and internet-based communication, with fewer than 150,000 fixed lines still active nationwide.

[ 249 ] Meanwhile, the country maintains one of Europe’s highest Fiber-to-the-Home (FTTH) penetration rates — exceeding 55% by 2025, building on its top ranking of 36.8% back in 2016 according to the FTTH Council Europe.

[ 250 ] Lithuania is also a regional leader in data infrastructure. There are four TIER III datacenters in the country, [ 251 ] and Lithuania ranks among the top 40 globally in data center density, according to Cloudscene’s latest data.

[ 252 ] The Rural Areas Broadband Network (RAIN) project, initially launched to bring fiber-optic broadband to underserved communities, has expanded significantly. By 2025, it enables over 55 communications operators to offer high-speed internet services to rural households, helping bridge the digital divide between urban and rural areas. The project continues to benefit from joint funding by the Lithuanian government and the European Union.

[ 253 ] Major telecom operators include Telia Lietuva, Bitė Lietuva, and Tele2, which all provide competitive 4G and 5G services. Huawei maintains a notable presence in Lithuania’s telecom infrastructure despite tighter government oversight on foreign technology vendors in strategic sectors.

[ 254 ] Infrastructure [ edit ] Transport [ edit ] Main article: Transport in Lithuania Major highways in Lithuania Rail transport consists of 1,762 km (1,095 mi) of 1,520 mm (4 ft 11.8 in) Russian gauge railway of which 122 km (76 mi) are electrified and 115 km (71 mi) of European standard gauge lines starting at the Lithuania–Poland border .

[ 255 ] Lithuania received its first railway connection in the middle of the 19th century, when the Saint Petersburg–Warsaw railway was constructed. It included a stretch from Daugavpils via Vilnius and Kaunas to Virbalis. The first and only still operating Kaunas tunnel was completed in 1860. The Rail Baltica railway will link Kaunas to Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Poland, and Germany.

Marijampolė railway station , completed in 1924 Among the EU countries, Lithuania has the highest share of total freight transported by rail with 31.7% in 2023.

[ 256 ] This decreased over 50% since 2018, mainly caused by the sanctions imposed on Belarusian exports and Russia .

[ 257 ] [ 258 ] In 2017, Lietuvos Geležinkeliai , a company that operates most railway lines in Lithuania, received EU penalty for breaching EU's antitrust laws and restricting competition in rail freight.

[ 259 ] Lithuania has an extensive network of motorways. WEF grades Lithuanian roads at 4.7 / 7.0 [ 260 ] and Lithuanian road authority (LAKD) at 6.5 / 10.0.

[ 261 ] Lithuanian trucking companies drew attention in 2016 [ 262 ] and 2017 [ 263 ] with huge and record-breaking orders of trucks. Almost 90% of commercial truck traffic is international transports, the highest of any EU country.

[ 264 ] Transportation is the third largest sector in Lithuanian economy.

[ 265 ] The sector, in conjunction with privately owned motor vehicles, accounts for 40% of national energy consumption and for 75% of oil usage. The car park is among the oldest within the European Union and constitutes the most significant single source of domestic greenhouse gas emissions .

[ 266 ] The Port of Klaipėda is the only commercial cargo port in Lithuania. In 2011 45.5 million tons of cargo were handled (including Būtingė oil terminal figures) [ 267 ] Port of Klaipėda is outside of EU's 20 largest ports, [ 268 ] [ 269 ] but it is the eighth largest port in the Baltic Sea region [ 270 ] [ 271 ] with ongoing expansion plans.

[ 272 ] As of 2022, the LIWA (Lithuanian Inland Waterways Authority, Vidaus vandens keliu direkcija in Lithuanian) is developing a strategy to resurrect cargo shipping on the Nemunas. Its fleet of electric ships will travel 260 km between the Port of Klaipda and the industrial and transportation centre of Kaunas.

[ 273 ] The project is anticipated to need a €75.7 million initial investment in total. and estimated to eliminate 48 000 truck trips annually.

[ 274 ] [ 275 ] The inland river cargo port in Marvelė, linking Kaunas and Klaipėda, received its first cargo in 2019.

[ 276 ] Vilnius Airport is the largest airport in Lithuania and 91st busiest airport in Europe . It served 3.8 million passengers in 2016.

[ 277 ] Other airports include Kaunas Airport , Palanga International Airport and Šiauliai Airport . Kaunas Airport is a small commercial cargo airport which started regular commercial cargo traffic in 2011.

[ 278 ] Energy [ edit ] Main article: Energy in Lithuania See also: Renewable energy in Lithuania FSRU Independence in port of Klaipėda Systematic diversification of energy imports and resources is the key energy strategy.

[ 279 ] Long-term aims were defined in National Energy Independence strategy in 2012.

[ 280 ] It was estimated that strategic energy independence initiatives will cost €6.3–7.8 billion and provide annual savings of €0.9–1.1 billion.

After the decommissioning of the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant , Lithuania turned from electricity exporter to electricity importer. As of 2015 [update] , 66% of electrical power was imported.

[ 281 ] Unit No. 1 was closed in 2004, as a condition of entry into the European Union; Unit No. 2 was closed down in 2009. Proposals have been made to construct a new Visaginas Nuclear Power Plant .

[ 282 ] However, a non-binding referendum held in 2012 clouded the prospects for the Visaginas project, as 63% of voters said no to a new nuclear power plant.

[ 283 ] Kruonis Pumped Storage Plant The main source of electrical power is the Elektrėnai Power Plant . Other primary sources are the Kruonis Pumped Storage Plant and Kaunas Hydroelectric Power Plant . Kruonis Pumped Storage Plant is the only power plant in the Baltic states  to be used for regulation of the power system's operation with generating capacity of 900 MW for at least 12 hours.

[ 284 ] First geothermal heating plant ( Klaipėda Geothermal Demonstration Plant ) in the Baltic Sea region was built in 2004.

Lithuania–Sweden submarine electricity interconnection NordBalt and Lithuania–Poland electricity interconnection LitPol Link were launched at the end of 2015.

[ 285 ] In 2018, synchronising the Baltic states' electricity grid with the Synchronous grid of Continental Europe has started.

[ 286 ] In 2016, 20.8% of electricity consumed in Lithuania came from renewable sources.

[ 287 ] In order to break down Gazprom 's natural gas monopoly [ 288 ] [ 289 ] the first large scale LNG import terminal ( Klaipėda LNG FSRU ) in the Baltic region was built in the port of Klaipėda in 2014. The Klaipėda LNG terminal was called Independence, thus emphasising the aim to diversify the energy market of Lithuania. Norwegian company Equinor supplies 540 million cubic metres (19 billion cubic feet) of natural gas annually from 2015 until 2020.

[ 290 ] The terminal is able to meet 100 percent of demand, and is projected to meet 90 percent of the demand in Latvia and Estonia.

[ 291 ] Gas Interconnection Poland–Lithuania , also known as Lithuania–Poland pipeline, became operational in 2022.

Demographics [ edit ] Population density in Lithuania by elderships (admistrative units) Since the Neolithic period, the demographics of Lithuania have stayed fairly homogenous. There is a high probability that the inhabitants of present-day Lithuania have similar genetic compositions to their ancestors, [ 292 ] [ 293 ] [ 294 ] although without being actually isolated from them.

[ 295 ] The population has little apparent genetic differences among ethnic subgroups.

[ 296 ] A 2004 analysis of MtDNA revealed that Lithuanians are genetically close to the Slavic and Finno-Ugric speaking populations of northern and eastern Europe.

Y-chromosome SNP haplogroup analysis showed Lithuanians to be genetically closest to Latvians and Estonians .

[ 297 ] The median age in 2022 was 44 years (male: 41, female: 47).

[ 298 ] In 2021, the age structure of the population was as follows: 0–14 years, 14.86% (male 214,113/female 203,117) 15–64 years: 65.19% (male 896,400/female 934,467) 65 years and over: 19.95% (male 195,269/female 365,014).

[ 298 ] Lithuania has a sub-replacement fertility rate : the total fertility rate was 1.34 children born per woman in 2021, and the mean age of women at childbirth was 30.3 years. The average age of first childbirth for women was 28.2 years. The human sex ratio is male leaning for the age categories 15–44, with 1.0352 males for every female.

[ 298 ] As of 2021 [update] , 25.6% of births were to unmarried women. The mean age at first marriage in 2021 was 28.3 years for women and 30.5 years for men.

Russians in Lithuania are the second largest minority, concentrated in Visaginas (47.4%), Zarasai District Municipality (17.2%) and Klaipėda (16%).

[ 300 ] About 2,250 Roma live in Lithuania, mostly in Vilnius, Kaunas and Panevėžys ; their organizations are supported by the National Minority and Emigration Department.

[ 301 ] For centuries, Tatar and Karaite communities have lived in Lithuania. In 2021, there were around 2,150 registered Tatars and 196 Karaites in the country.

[ 302 ] [ 303 ] The official language is Lithuanian , but in some areas there is a significant presence of minority languages such as Polish , Russian , Belarusian and Ukrainian . The greatest presence of minorities and the use of these languages are in Šalčininkai, Visaginas, and Vilnius District.

[ 300 ] In 1941, the Jewish population reached its peak at approximately 250,000 people, making up about 10% of the population. Today, however, it has dwindled to a very small number.

Yiddish is spoken by members of the tiny remaining Jewish community . The state laws guarantee education in minority languages, and there are numerous publicly funded schools in the areas populated by minorities, with Polish as the language of instruction being the most widely available.

[ 304 ] According to the survey carried out within the framework of the Lithuanian census of 2021 , 85.33% of the population speaks Lithuanian as their native language, 6.8% are native speakers of Russian and 5.1% of Polish.

[ 306 ] Around 85% of upper secondary school students were studying English in 2022, [ 307 ] and around 80% of people in the 15-19 age group reported knowing English in 2011.

[ 308 ] Urbanization [ edit ] See also: List of cities in Lithuania , List of towns in Lithuania , and List of cities in the Baltic states by population There has been a steady movement of population to the cities since the 1990s, encouraged by the planning of regional centres, such as Alytus , Marijampolė , Utena , Plungė , and Mažeikiai . By the early 21st century, about two-thirds of the population lived in urban areas. As of 2021 [update] , 68.19% of the population lives in urban areas.

[ 298 ] Functional urban areas include Vilnius (population 708,203), Kaunas (population 391,153), and Panevėžys (population 124,526).

[ 314 ] It co-exists with a significant private healthcare sector. In 2003–2012, the network of hospitals was restructured, as part of wider healthcare service reforms. It started in 2003–2005 with the expansion of ambulatory services and primary care.

[ 315 ] In 2016, Lithuania ranked 27th in Europe in the Euro health consumer index , a ranking of European healthcare systems based on waiting time, results and other indicators. Lithuania ranked 19th in the 2024 edition of the World Happiness Report .

[ 316 ] As of 2023 [update] , life expectancy at birth was 76.0 (70.6 years for males and 81.6 for females) [ 317 ] and the infant mortality rate was 2.99 per 1,000 births.

[ 318 ] The annual population growth rate increased by 0.3% in 2007. Lithuania has seen a dramatic rise in suicides in the 1990s.

[ 319 ] The suicide rate has been constantly decreasing since, but it still remains the highest in the EU and one of the highest in the OECD . The suicide rate as of 2019 is 20.2 per 100,000 people.

[ 319 ] Suicide in Lithuania has been a subject of research, but the main reasons behind the high rate are psychological and economic, including social transformations and economic recessions, alcoholism, lack of tolerance in the society, and bullying.

[ 320 ] By 2000, the vast majority of health care institutions were non-profit-making enterprises and a private sector developed, providing mostly outpatient services which are paid for out-of-pocket. The Ministry of Health also runs a few health care facilities and is involved in the running of the two major Lithuanian teaching hospitals. It is responsible for the State Public Health Centre which manages the public health network including ten county public health centres with their local branches. The ten counties run county hospitals and specialised health care facilities.

[ 321 ] There is Compulsory Health Insurance for the Lithuanian residents. There are 5 territorial health insurance funds, covering Vilnius, Kaunas, Klaipėda, Šiauliai and Panevėžys. Contributions for people who are economically active are 9% of income.

[ 322 ] Emergency medical services are provided free of charge to all residents. Access to the secondary and tertiary care, such as hospital treatment, is normally via referral by a general practitioner.

[ 323 ] Lithuania has one of the lowest health care prices in Europe.

[ 324 ] Religion [ edit ] Main article: Religion in Lithuania See also: Lithuanian mythology Hill of Crosses near Šiauliai Chapel of Saint Casimir , the patron saint of Lithuania and Lithuanian youth, with his sarcophagus in the centre According to the 2021 census, 74.2% of residents were Catholics.

[ 3 ] Catholicism has been the main religion since the official Christianisation of Lithuania in 1387. The Catholic Church was persecuted by the Russian Empire as part of the Russification policies and by the Soviet Union as part of the overall anti-religious campaigns . During the Soviet era, some priests actively led the resistance against the communist regime, as symbolised by the Hill of Crosses and exemplified by The Chronicle of the Catholic Church in Lithuania .

3.7% of the population are Eastern Orthodox , mainly among the Russian minority.

[ 3 ] The community of Old Believers (0.6% of population) dates back to the 1660s.

Protestants are 0.8%, of which 0.6% are Lutheran and 0.2% are Reformed . Before World War II, according to Losch (1932), the Lutherans were 3.3% of the total population.

[ 325 ] They were mainly Germans and Prussian Lithuanians in the Klaipėda Region (Memel territory). This population fled or was expelled after the war , and Protestantism is now mainly represented by ethnic Lithuanians throughout the northern and western parts of the country, as well as in large urban areas. Newly arriving evangelical churches have established missions since 1990.

[ 326 ] Hinduism is a minority religion and a fairly recent development. Hinduism is spread by Hindu organizations: ISKCON , Sathya Sai Baba , Brahma Kumaris and Osho Rajneesh .

ISKCON (Lithuanian: Krišnos sąmonės judėjimas ) is the largest and the oldest movement as the first Krishna followers date to 1979.

[ 327 ] Brahma Kumaris maintains the Centre Brahma Kumaris in Antakalnis , Vilnius.

The historical communities of Lipka Tatars maintain Islam as their religion. Lithuania was historically home to a significant Jewish community and was an important centre of Jewish scholarship and culture from the 18th century until the eve of World War II. Of the approximately 220,000 Jews who lived in Lithuania in June 1941, almost all were killed during the Holocaust .

[ 328 ] [ 329 ] The Lithuanian Jewish community numbered about 4,000 at the end of 2009.

[ 330 ] Romuva , the neopagan revival of the ancient religious practices, has gained popularity over the years. Romuva claims to continue living pagan traditions, which survived in folklore and customs.

[ 331 ] [ 332 ] [ 333 ] Romuva is a polytheistic pagan faith, which asserts the sanctity of nature and has elements of ancestor worship .

[ 334 ] According to the 2001 census , there were 1,270 people of Baltic faith in Lithuania.

[ 335 ] That number jumped to 5,118 in the 2011 census and decreased to 3,917 in 2021 census.

[ 336 ] [ 337 ] Education [ edit ] Main article: Education in Lithuania See also: List of universities and colleges in Lithuania Vilnius University , one of the oldest universities in the region.

[ 338 ] It was established by Stephen Báthory , King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, in 1579.

The constitution mandates ten-year education ending at age 16 and guarantees a free public higher education for students deemed 'good'.

[ 339 ] The Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Lithuania proposes national educational policies and goals that are then voted for in the Seimas. Laws govern long-term educational strategy along with general laws on standards for higher education, vocational training, law and science, adult education, and special education.

[ 340 ] 5.4% of GDP or 15.4% of total public expenditure was spent for education in 2016.

[ 341 ] Vilnius University Life Sciences Center in the Sunrise Valley According to the World Bank , the literacy rate among Lithuanians aged 15 years and older is 100%.

[ 342 ] School attendance rates are above the EU average, and school leave is less common than in the EU. According to Eurostat Lithuania leads among other countries of the European Union in people with secondary education (93.3%).

[ 343 ] Based on OECD data, Lithuania is among the top 5 countries in the world in postsecondary (tertiary) education attainment.

[ 344 ] As of 2022 [update] , 58.15% of the population aged 25 to 34, and 33.28% of the population aged 55 to 64 had completed tertiary education.

[ 345 ] The share of tertiary-educated 25–64-year-olds in STEM ( Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics ) fields in Lithuania were above the OECD average (29% and 26% respectively), similarly to business, administration and law (25% and 23% respectively).

[ 346 ] The modern education system has multiple structural problems. Insufficient funding, quality issues, and decreasing student population are the most prevalent. Teacher salaries are below the EU average, despite significant increases since 2011.

[ 347 ] Low teacher salaries was the primary reason behind national teacher strikes in 2014, [ 348 ] 2015, [ 349 ] and 2016.

[ 350 ] [ 351 ] Salaries in the higher education sector are also low. Many professors have a second job to supplement their income.

[ 352 ] PISA report from 2022 found that results in math, science and reading were around OECD average, after trailing the OECD average in earlier reports in 2010 and 2015, although the relative improvement was primarily driven by the decrease in performance in the other OECD countries as a result of COVID 19 pandemic.

[ 353 ] [ 354 ] [ 355 ] The population ages 6 to 19 has decreased by 36% between 2005 and 2015. As a result, the student-teacher ratio is decreasing and expenditure per student is increasing, but schools, particularly in rural areas, are forced into reorganizations and consolidations.

[ 341 ] As with other Baltic nations, in particular Latvia, the large volume of higher education graduates within the country, coupled with the high rate of spoken second languages is contributing to an education brain drain .

As of 2008 [update] , there were 15 public and 6 private universities as well as 16 public and 11 private colleges.

[ 356 ] Vilnius University is one of the oldest universities in Northern Europe and the largest university in Lithuania.

Kaunas University of Technology is the largest technical university in the Baltic States and the second largest university in Lithuania. In an attempt to reduce costs [ 357 ] and adapt to sharply decreasing number of high-school students, [ 358 ] parliament decided to reduce the number of universities.

[ 359 ] [ 360 ] In early 2018, Lithuanian University of Educational Sciences and Aleksandras Stulginskis University were merged into Vytautas Magnus University .

[ 361 ] Culture [ edit ] Main article: Culture of Lithuania See also: List of Lithuanians Lithuanian language [ edit ] A priest, lexicographer Konstantinas Sirvydas – cherisher of Lithuanian language in the 17th century Jonas Jablonskis is the father of standard Lithuanian language.

The Lithuanian language ( lietuvių kalba ) is recognized as one of the official languages of the European Union. There are about 2.96 million native Lithuanian speakers in Lithuania and about 200,000 abroad. Lithuanian is a Baltic language , closely related to Latvian , although they are not mutually intelligible . It is written in an adapted version of the Roman script . Lithuanian is believed to be the linguistically most conservative living Indo-European tongue , retaining many features of Proto Indo-European .

[ 362 ] Lithuanian language studies are important for comparative linguistics and for reconstruction of Proto-Indo-European language .

[ 363 ] The earliest known Lithuanian glosses (between 1520 and 1530) written in the margins of Johann Herolt book Liber Discipuli de eruditione Christifidelium . Words: teprÿdav[ſ]ʒÿ (let it strike), vbagÿſte (indigence).

There are two main dialects: Aukštaitian dialect and Samogitian dialect . Aukštaitian dialect is mainly used in the central, southern and eastern parts of Lithuania while Samogitian dialect is used in the western part of the country.

[ 364 ] The Samogitian dialect has many completely different words and is even considered a separate language by some linguists.

[ 365 ] Nowadays, the distinguishing feature between the two dialects is the unequal pronunciation of accented and unaccented two-vowels uo and ie.

[ 364 ] The groundwork for written Lithuanian was laid in 16th and 17th centuries by Lithuanian noblemen and scholars, who promoted Lithuanian language, created dictionaries and published books – Mikalojus Daukša , Stanislovas Rapolionis , Abraomas Kulvietis , Jonas Bretkūnas , Martynas Mažvydas , Konstantinas Sirvydas , Simonas Vaišnoras-Varniškis.

[ 366 ] The first grammar book of the Lithuanian language Grammatica Litvanica was published in Latin in 1653 by Danielius Kleinas .

Jonas Jablonskis ' works and activities are especially important for the Lithuanian literature moving from the use of dialects to a standard Lithuanian language. The linguistic material which he collected was published in the 20 volumes of Academic Dictionary of Lithuanian and is still being used in research and in editing of texts and books. He also introduced the letter ū into Lithuanian writing.

Duhamel has developed the approach further: He stresses that the French construction does not correspond to either parliamentary or the presidential form of government, and then develops the distinction of 'système politique' and 'régime constitutionnel'. While the former comprises the exercise of power that results from the dominant institutional practice, the latter is the totality of the rules for the dominant institutional practice of the power. In this way, France appears as 'presidentialist system' endowed with a 'semi-presidential regime' (1983: 587). By this standard he recognizes Duverger's pléiade as semi-presidential regimes, as well as Poland, Romania, Bulgaria and Lithuania (1993: 87).

Lithuania last night became the first republic to break away from the Soviet Union, by proclaiming the restoration of its pre-war independence. The newly-elected parliament, 'reflecting the people's will,' decreed the restoration of 'the sovereign rights of the Lithuanian state, infringed by alien forces in 1940,' and declared that from that moment Lithuania was again an independent state ^ Martha Brill Olcott (1990).

"The Lithuanian Crisis" .

Archived from the original on 20 July 2021 . Retrieved 18 November 2018 .

For over two years Lithuania has been moving toward reclaiming its independence. This drive reached a crescendo on 11 March 1990, when the Supreme Soviet of Lithuania declared the republic no longer bound by Soviet law. The act reasserted the independence Lithuania had declared more than seventy years before, a declaration unilaterally annulled by the U.S.S.R. in 1940 when it annexed Lithuania as the result of a pact between Stalin and Hitler.
