Difference in predicted house prices within the states of Austria, from a GWR and a GWNN whose the weighting metrics respectively use the Euclidean distance (ED) and travel time distance (TTD) [ 1 ] Spatial neural networks ( SNNs ) constitute a supercategory of tailored neural networks (NNs) for representing and predicting geographic phenomena. They generally improve both the statistical accuracy and reliability of the a-spatial/classic NNs whenever they handle geo-spatial datasets , and also of the other spatial (statistical) models (e.g. spatial regression models) whenever the geo-spatial datasets ' variables depict non-linear relations .

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 1 ] History [ edit ] Openshaw (1993) and Hewitson et al. (1994) started investigating the applications of the a-spatial/classic NNs to geographic phenomena.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] They observed that a-spatial/classic NNs outperform the other extensively applied a-spatial/classic statistical models (e.g. regression models, clustering algorithms, maximum likelihood classifications) in geography , especially when there exist non-linear relations between the geo-spatial datasets' variables .

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] Thereafter, Openshaw (1998) also compared these a-spatial/classic NNs with other modern and original a-spatial statistical models at that time (i.e. fuzzy logic models, genetic algorithm models); he concluded that the a-spatial/classic NNs are statistically competitive.

[ 6 ] Thereafter scientists developed several categories of SNNs – see below.

Spatial models [ edit ] Spatial statistical models (aka geographically weighted models, or merely spatial models) like the geographically weighted regressions (GWRs), SNNs, etc., are spatially tailored (a-spatial/classic) statistical models, so to learn and model the deterministic components of the spatial variability (i.e.

spatial dependence/autocorrelation , spatial heterogeneity , spatial association/cross-correlation ) from the geo-locations of the geo-spatial datasets’ (statistical) individuals/units .

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 1 ] [ 9 ] Categories [ edit ] There exist several categories of methods/approaches for designing and applying SNNs.

One-Size-Fits-all (OSFA) spatial neural networks , use the OSFA method/approach for globally computing the spatial weights and designing a spatial structure from the originally a-spatial/classic neural networks.

[ 2 ] Spatial Variability Aware Neural Networks ( SVANNs ) use an enhanced OSFA method/approach that locally recomputes the spatial weights and redesigns the spatial structure of the originally a-spatial/classic NNs, at each geo-location of the (statistical) individuals/units' attributes' values.

[ 3 ] They generally outperform the OSFA spatial neural networks, but they do not consistently handle the spatial heterogeneity at multiple scales.

[ 10 ] Geographically Weighted Neural Networks ( GWNNs ) are similar to the SVANNs but they use the so-called Geographically Weighted Model (GWM) method/approach by Lu et al. (2023), so to locally recompute the spatial weights and redesign the spatial structure of the originally a-spatial/classic neural networks.

[ 1 ] [ 9 ] Like the SVANNs, they do not consistently handle spatial heterogeneity at multiple scales.

[ 1 ] Applications [ edit ] There exist case-study applications of SNNs in: energy for predicting the electricity consumption ; [ 11 ] agriculture for classifying the vegetation ; [ 12 ] real estate for appraising the premises .
