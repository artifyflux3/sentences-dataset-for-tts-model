[ 243 ] Switzerland [ edit ] In Switzerland , any citizen aged 18 or over can become a candidate and be elected in any federal election.

Taiwan [ edit ] In the Republic of China (commonly known as Taiwan), the minimum age of candidacy is 23, unless otherwise specified in the Constitution or any relevant laws.

[ 244 ] The Civil Servants Election and Recall Act specifies that candidates for township, city, and indigenous district chiefs must be at least 26, and candidates for municipality, county, and city governors must be at least 30.

[ 245 ] The minimum age to be elected as president or vice-president is 40.

[ 246 ] Tibet [ edit ] The 14th Dalai Lama was enthroned at the age of 4, and none of his predecessors have been enthroned before age 4. The coming of age for the Dalai Lama is 18, when responsibilities are assumed.

Turkey [ edit ] The 1876 constitution set the age for parliamentary elections as 30. This remained unchanged until 13 October 2006, when it was lowered to 25 through a constitutional amendment. In 2017, it was further lowered to 18, the same as the voting age .

[ 247 ] In presidential elections the candidacy age is 40.

United Kingdom [ edit ] In the United Kingdom , a person must be aged 18 or over to stand in elections to all parliaments, assemblies, and councils within the UK, devolved , or local level. This age requirement also applies in elections to any individual elective public office; the main example is that of an elected mayor , whether of London or a local authority . There are no higher age requirements for particular positions in public office. Candidates are required to be aged 18 on both the day of nomination and the day of the poll.

[ citation needed ] Previously, the requirement was that candidates be 21 years old. During the early 2000s, the British Youth Council and other groups successfully campaigned to lower age of candidacy requirements in the United Kingdom.

[ 248 ] The age of candidacy was reduced from 21 to 18 in England , Wales and Scotland on 1 January 2007, [ 249 ] when section 17 of the Electoral Administration Act 2006 entered into force.

[ 250 ] United States [ edit ] Main article: Age of candidacy laws in the United States In the United States , a person must be aged 35 or over to serve as president. To be a senator, a person must be aged 30 or over. To be a Representative, a person must be aged 25 or older. This is specified in the U.S. Constitution . Most states in the U.S. also have age requirements for the offices of Governor, State Senator, and State Representative.

[ 251 ] Some states have a minimum age requirement to hold any elected office (usually 21 or 18).

Controversies [ edit ] In 1972, Linda Jenness ran for president of the United States as the third-party Socialist Workers Party candidate, although she was 31 at the time.

Many youth rights groups view current age of candidacy requirements as unjustified age discrimination .

[ 252 ] Occasionally people who are younger than the minimum age will run for an office in protest of the requirement or because they do not know that the requirement exists. On extremely rare occasions, young people have been elected to offices they do not qualify for and have been deemed ineligible to assume the office.

In 1872, Victoria Woodhull ran for President of the United States, although according to the Constitution she would have been too young to be President if elected.

[ 253 ] In 1934, Rush Holt of West Virginia was elected to the Senate of the United States at the age of 29. Since the U.S. Constitution requires senators to be at least 30, Holt was forced to wait until his 30th birthday, six months after the start of the session, before being sworn in.

[ 254 ] In 1954, Richard Fulton won election to the Tennessee Senate . Shortly after being sworn in, Fulton was ousted from office because he was 27 years old at the time. The Tennessee State Constitution required that senators be at least 30.

[ 255 ] Rather than hold a new election, the previous incumbent, Clifford Allen , was allowed to resume his office for another term. Fulton went on to win the next State Senate election in 1956 and was later elected to the U.S. House of Representatives where he served for 10 years.

In 1964, Congressman Jed Johnson Jr.

of Oklahoma was elected to the 89th Congress in the 1964 election while still aged 24 years. However, he became eligible for the House after turning 25 on his birthday, 27 December 1964, seven days before his swearing in, making him the youngest legally elected and seated member of the United States Congress ever.

[ 256 ] In South Carolina, two Senators aged 24 were elected, but were too young according to the State Constitution: Mike Laughlin in 1969 and Bryan Dorn (later a U.S. congressman) in 1941. They were seated anyway.

[ 257 ] On several occasions, the Socialist Workers Party (USA) has nominated candidates too young to qualify for the offices they were running for. In 1972, Linda Jenness ran as the SWP presidential candidate, although she was 31 at the time. Since the U.S. Constitution requires that the President and Vice President be at least 35 years old, Jenness was not able to receive ballot access in several states in which she otherwise qualified.

[ 258 ] Despite this handicap, Jenness still received 83,380 votes.

[ 259 ] In 2004, the SWP nominated Arrin Hawkins as the party's vice-presidential candidate, although she was 28 at the time. Hawkins was also unable to receive ballot access in several states due to her age.

[ 260 ] Reform efforts [ edit ] In the United States, many groups have attempted to lower age of candidacy requirements in various states. In 1994, South Dakota voters rejected a ballot measure that would have lowered the age requirements to serve as a State Senator or State Representative from 25 to 18. In 1998, however, they approved a similar ballot measure that reduced the age requirements for those offices from 25 to 21.

[ 261 ] In 2002, Oregon voters rejected a ballot measure that would have reduced the age requirement to serve as a State Representative from 21 to 18.

Venezuela [ edit ] In Venezuela , a person must be at least 30 to be President or Vice President , [ 262 ] 21 to be a deputy for the National Assembly [ 263 ] and 25 to be the Governor of a state .

Young people believe that the age to stand as candidates for local, regional, national and European elections should be 16, as should the age to become a trustee of a charity. Young people have significant responsibilities to society at the age of 16 and can have significant responsibilities in the private sector as company directors; this inconsistency should be rectified. Young people have lots to offer and the decision of their appointment to positions of political authority or governance of organisations should be in the hands of the electorate or membership respectfully.

Since they weren't going to be elected anyways, the Socialist Workers Party didn't care that they nominated a ticket entirely ineligible to be elected. Why? Because Róger Calero is both foreign born and also not a US citizen; and Arrin Hawkins is too young. To avoid ballot access problems for the SWP, as the constitutional ineligibility may also render them unable to be listed on the ballot in some states, the 2000 SWP ticket of James Harris for President and Margaret Trowe for Vice President are being used in states that will not permit the Calero-Hawkins slate to be listed.
