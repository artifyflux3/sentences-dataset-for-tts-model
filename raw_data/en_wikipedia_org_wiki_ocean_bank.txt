Georges Bank in the Gulf of Maine is a large elevated area of the sea floor, shown in this map as the light blue region at the bottom centre.

Somewhat like continental slopes , ocean bank slopes can upwell as tidal and other flows intercept them, sometimes resulting in nutrient-rich currents.

[ how?

] Because of this, some large banks, such as Dogger Bank and the Grand Banks of Newfoundland , are among the richest fishing grounds in the world.

There are some banks that were reported in the 19th century by navigators, such as Wachusett Reef , whose existence is doubtful.

Types [ edit ] Ocean banks may be of volcanic nature. Banks may be carbonate or terrigenous . In tropical areas some banks are submerged atolls . As they are not associated with any landmass , banks have no outside source of sediments . 
Carbonate banks are typically platforms, rising from the ocean depths, whereas terrigenous banks are elevated sedimentary deposits.

[ 1 ] Seamounts , by contrast, are mountains rising from the deep sea and are steeper and higher in comparison to the surrounding seabed .

[ 2 ] Examples of these are Pioneer and Guide Seamounts, west of the Farallon Islands . The Pioneer Seamount has a depth of 1,000 meters, [ 2 ] In other cases, parts of a bank may reach above the water surface, thereby forming islands .
