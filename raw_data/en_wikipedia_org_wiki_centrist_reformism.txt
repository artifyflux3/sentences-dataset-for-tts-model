It is part of South Korea's centrist tradition.

In international standards, centrist reformism can be seen as conservative liberalism and/or liberal conservatism .

History [ edit ] The first party to put Jungdogaehyeok as its main ideology the Peace Democratic Party , a liberal party led by Kim Dae-jung in 1987. When the National Congress for New Politics was founded in 1995, it emphasized "moderate conservatives" ( Korean : 온건 보수 ; Hanja : 穩健保守 ) more than Jungdogaehyeok to gain more support from conservatives.

[ 1 ] However, since the social liberal Roh Moo-hyun government, the term has not been used frequently for some time.

In 2016, People Party officially put forward Jungdogaehyeok as its main ideology.
