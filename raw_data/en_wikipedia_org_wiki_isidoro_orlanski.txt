He is known for his contributions to the dynamics of weather systems , ocean currents and mesoscale meteorology . He is an emeritus professor at Princeton University .

[ 1 ] Early life and education [ edit ] Isidoro Orlanski was born in Rivera, Buenos Aires , in 1939 to Jewish immigrants Samuel and Sara Orlanski, who fled Wolkowysk, Poland during the early 20th century pogroms. With the help of the Jewish Colonization Association , which enabled Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe to farm in Argentina, the Orlanski family settled in rural Argentina before moving to Buenos Aires in the early 1940s.

[ 2 ] In 1959, Orlanski enrolled in the Faculty of Exact and Natural Sciences (Spanish: Facultad de Ciencias Exactas ) at the University of Buenos Aires , where he studied physics. In 1964, Orlanski earned a degree in physics from University of Buenos Aires . In 1965, he received a grant to pursue graduate studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

[ 3 ] Orlanski completed his PhD in 1967 supervised by Jule Charney .

[ 4 ] His thesis, titled Instability of Frontal Waves, earned the Carl Gustav Rossby Award.

[ 5 ] Career [ edit ] Orlanski moved to the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL), [ 6 ] where he initially worked with Joseph Smagorinsky . The GFDL, under the leadership of Smagorinsky, was developing numerical models for weather forecasting and climate assessment.

[ 7 ] He relocated with the lab to Princeton University in New Jersey where he became a lecturer in Atmospheric and Oceanic Science.

[ 8 ] By 1980, GFDL had grown to 134 staff members, with Orlanski being appointed the lab's Deputy Director.

[ 9 ] While on sabbatical in Argentina in 1985, Orlanski established an organization for numerical modeling that became the Centro de Investigaciones para el Mar y la Atmósfera (CIMA).

[ 10 ] Orlanski retired from GFDL in 2007 but continued teaching at Princeton University until 2017, retiring as a lecturer with the rank of Senior Meteorologist, Emeritus.

[ 1 ] Research [ edit ] Orlanski worked in the field of mesoscale meteorology .

[ 11 ] He introduced the terms meso-alpha, meso-beta, and meso-gamma to classify the horizontal scales of atmospheric processes.

[ 12 ] The primary purpose of Orlanski’s classification of mesoscale phenomena was to assist modelers in designing limited-area models for mesoscale prediction.

[ 13 ] This framework was used in the design of field experiments for mesoscale observations, as well as in defining the spatial and temporal scales necessary for forecast models.

[ 14 ] It took over two decades for both numerical models and observational technologies to achieve an acceptable level of accuracy in this domain.

[ 15 ] Orlanski's research on boundary conditions for unbounded hyperbolic flows has applications beyond meteorology.

[ 16 ] Awards and honors [ edit ] Carl Gustav Rossby Award (MIT, 1968) – For best PhD thesis in the Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences program.

[ 5 ] RAICES Prize (2011) – Awarded by the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation of Argentina for contributions to science and scientific development in Argentina.

[ 17 ] Fellow of the American Meteorological Society .
