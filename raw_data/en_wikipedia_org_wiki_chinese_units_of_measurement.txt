Chinese units of measurement A traditional Chinese scale Chinese 市制 Literal meaning market system Transcriptions Standard Mandarin Hanyu Pinyin shìzhì Wade–Giles shih-chih Alternative Chinese name Chinese 市用制 Literal meaning market-use system Transcriptions Standard Mandarin Hanyu Pinyin shìyòngzhì Wade–Giles shih-yung-chih Chinese units of measurement , known in Chinese as the shìzhì ("market system"), are the traditional units of measurement of the Han Chinese . Although Chinese numerals have been decimal (base-10) since the Shang , several Chinese measures use hexadecimal (base-16).

[ citation needed ] Local applications have varied, but the Chinese dynasties usually proclaimed standard measurements and recorded their predecessor's systems in their histories .

In the present day, the People's Republic of China maintains some customary units based upon the market units but standardized to round values in the metric system , for example the common jin or catty of exactly 500 g . The Chinese name for most metric units is based on that of the closest traditional unit; when confusion might arise, the word "market" ( 市 , shì ) is used to specify the traditional unit and "common" or "public" ( 公 , gōng ) is used for the metric value.

Taiwan , like Korea , saw its traditional units standardized to Japanese values and their conversion to a metric basis, such as the Taiwanese ping of about 3.306 m 2 based on the square ken . The Hong Kong SAR continues to use its traditional units , now legally defined based on a local equation with metric units. For instance, the Hong Kong catty is precisely 604.789 82 g .

Note: The names lí ( 釐 or 厘 ) and fēn ( 分 ) for small units are the same for length, area, and mass; however, they refer to different kinds of measurements.

The Xiao Erya and the Kongzi Jiayu state that length units were derived from the human body. According to the Records of the Grand Historian , these human body units caused inconsistency, and Yu the Great , another legendary figure, unified the length measurements.

Rulers with decimal units have been unearthed from Shang dynasty tombs.

In the Zhou dynasty , the king conferred nobles with powers of the state and the measurement units began to be inconsistent from state to state. After the Warring States period , Qin Shi Huang unified China, and later standardized measurement units. In the Han dynasty , these measurements were still being used, and were documented systematically in the Book of Han .

Astronomical instruments show little change of the length of chi in the following centuries, since the calendar needed to be consistent. It was not until the introduction of decimal units in the Ming dynasty that the traditional system was revised.

Republican Era [ edit ] See also: Taiwanese units of measurement On 7 January 1915, the Beiyang government promulgated a measurement law to use not only metric system as the standard but also a set of Chinese-style measurement based directly on the Qing dynasty definitions ( 营造尺库平制 ).

[ 1 ] On 16 February 1929, the Nationalist government adopted and promulgated The Weights and Measures Act [ 2 ] to adopt the metric system as the official standard and to limit the newer Chinese units of measurement ( Chinese : 市用制 ; pinyin : shìyòngzhì ; lit.

'market-use system') to private sales and trade in Article 11, effective on 1 January 1930. These newer "market" units are based on rounded metric numbers.

[ 3 ] These units are still retained for use in the Republic of China -controlled territories of Kinmen and Matsu nowadays.

People's Republic of China [ edit ] The Government of the People's Republic of China continued using the market system along with metric system, as decreed by the State Council of the People's Republic of China on 25 June 1959, but 1 catty being 500 grams, would become divided into 10 (new) taels , instead of 16 (old) taels, to be converted from province to province , while exempting Chinese prescription drugs from the conversion to prevent errors.

[ 4 ] On 27 February 1984, the State Council of the People's Republic of China decreed the market system to remain acceptable until the end of 1990 and ordered the transition to the national legal measures by that time, but farmland measures would be exempt from this mandatory metrication until further investigation and study.

[ 5 ] Hong Kong [ edit ] Main article: Hong Kong units of measurement In 1976 the Hong Kong Metrication Ordinance allowed a gradual replacement of the system in favor of the International System of Units (SI) metric system.

[ 6 ] The Weights and Measures Ordinance defines the metric, Imperial, and Chinese units.

[ 7 ] As of 2012, all three systems are legal for trade and are in widespread use.

Macau [ edit ] On 24 August 1992, Macau published Law No. 14/92/M to order that Chinese units of measurement similar to those used in Hong Kong, Imperial units , and United States customary units would be permissible for five years since the effective date of the Law, 1 January 1993, on the condition of indicating the corresponding SI values, then for three more years thereafter, Chinese, Imperial, and US units would be permissible as secondary to the SI.

Western Han (206 BCE–8 CE).

Hanzhong City Traditional units of length include the chi ( 尺 ), bu ( 步 ), and li ( 里 ). The precise length of these units, and the ratios between these units, has varied over time. 1 bu has consisted of either 5 or 6 chi , while 1 li has consisted of 300 or 360 bu .

( June 2025 ) Mass [ edit ] Ancient Chinese weight units are mostly defined around the jin or catty. Blanks in the table means that the derived unit is not used in the era.

Later dynasties have abandoned the unit lun .

Modern Chinese units [ edit ] Chinese measurement law in 1915 All "metric values" given in the tables are exact unless otherwise specified by the approximation sign '~'. Certain units are also listed at List of Chinese classifiers → Measurement units .

The units in the following tables can be grouped into a few types: Traditional-derived units for length, area, volume, and mass.

On the Chinese mainland, these units were defined in three batches. The Republic of China government promulgated in 1915 a metric version of the Qing Dynasty Yingzao Chi Kuping Zhi ( Chinese : 营造尺库平制 ; lit.

'Camp-builder's chi and Treasury's weights unit system'). The ROC government then promulgated the "market unit" ( Chinese : 市制 ) system in 1930, redefining traditional units as simple fractions of metric units. Finally, the People's Republic of China modified the "market unit" mass system to divide 1 jin into 10 instead of the traditional 16 liang for ease of calculation.

In Hong Kong and Macau the mass units were defined in terms of the British pound, specifically the 1878 definition of 0.45359 kg. The volume units were inherited from the Qing dynasty units, with a small difference compared to the 1915 definition. The length units were based on the unusually large chi found in the area of Guangdong (see Chi (unit) § Historical values ). The source of the area unit is unknown, as it appears to be based on a different chi of 35.6 centimetres (14.0 in) (obtained by taking the square root of the metric value of cek3 , the square- chi ).

A kilometre , however, may also be called 公里 gōnglǐ , i.e. a metric lǐ .

In the engineering field, traditional units are rounded up to metric units. For example, the Chinese word 絲 (T) or 丝 (S) sī is used to express 0.01 mm.

Volume [ edit ] These units are used to measure cereal grains, among other things. In imperial times, the physical standard for these was the jialiang .

Historiography [ edit ] As there were hundreds of unofficial measures in use, the bibliography is quite vast. The editions of Wu Chenglou's 1937 History of Chinese Measurement [ 17 ] were the usual standard up to the 1980s or so, but rely mostly on surviving literary accounts. Newer research has put more emphasis on archeological discoveries.

[ 18 ] Qiu Guangming & Zhang Yanming's 2005 bilingual Concise History of Ancient Chinese Measures and Weights summarizes these findings.

[ 19 ] A relatively recent and comprehensive bibliography, organized by period studied, has been compiled in 2012 by Cao & al.; [ 20 ] for a shorter list, see Wilkinson 's year 2000 Chinese History .

An alternate pronunciation for the unit, corresponding to today's dàn, evolved later from the word for a carrying pole, 擔/担.

^ 1 zhu was in turn divided into 100 shu (黍). Shu meaning proso millet , i.e. the mass of a millet grain. Similar to grain (unit) .
