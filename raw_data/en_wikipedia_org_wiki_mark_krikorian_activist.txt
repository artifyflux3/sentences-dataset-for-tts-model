Since 1995. Krikorian has been a contributor to National Review , a conservative publication.

[ 2 ] Krikorian is credited with popularizing the concept of illegal immigrant self-deportation with the term "attrition through enforcement", [ 3 ] and is an advisor to Project 2025 , [ 4 ] a right-wing conservative political initiative by the Heritage Foundation , a conservative think tank.

Early life and education [ edit ] Krikorian was born in the United States to American-born parents of Armenian descent from the (former) Soviet Republic . His father worked as a chef and restaurant manager, moving his family from New Haven, to Boston, Cleveland, Chicago, and then Boston again, always living in densely Armenian neighborhoods.

[ 5 ] His parents spoke to their children in Armenian but to each other in English. Krikorian knew only Armenian when he entered kindergarten.

[ 5 ] He lost his right eye to a retinal blastoma while still a baby.

[ 5 ] He earned his B.A. at Georgetown University and a master's at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University , further spending two years studying at the Yerevan State University in then- Soviet Armenia .

[ 6 ] [ 5 ] Career [ edit ] Krikorian was an editor at the Winchester Star , a local newspaper in Virginia, and worked as editor of an electronic media publication on marketing . He wrote for the monthly newsletter of the Federation for American Immigration Reform , before joining CIS in February 1995.

[ 5 ] A comment in one of his articles in the National Review was called misogynistic; he had said about President Obama that he was "an effete vacillator who is pushed around by his female subordinates".

[ 7 ] In January 2013, ABC News listed Krikorian as one of the top 20 immigration experts to follow on Twitter in the United States.

[ 8 ] In September 2024 Krikorian testified before Congress, being questioned about comments he made about Haiti, which he said was "so screwed up because it wasn't colonized long enough".
