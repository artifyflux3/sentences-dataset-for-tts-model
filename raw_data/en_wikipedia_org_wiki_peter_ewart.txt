( March 2011 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Peter Ewart Born ( 1767-05-14 ) 14 May 1767 Died 15 September 1842 (1842-09-15) (aged 75) Nationality British Occupation Engineer Peter Ewart (14 May 1767 – 15 September 1842) was a Scottish engineer who was influential in developing the technologies of turbines and theories of thermodynamics .

Biography [ edit ] He was son of the Church of Scotland minister of Troqueer near Dumfries , and was one of eleven children. His brother Joseph Ewart became British ambassador to Prussia; John, a doctor, became Chief Inspector of East India Company hospitals in India; and William, father of William Ewart , was business partner of Sir John Gladstone, [ 1 ] father of William Ewart Gladstone , whose godfather he was and whom he was named after.

Following graduation from the University of Edinburgh , [ citation needed ] he was apprenticed to millwright John Rennie .

[ 1 ] His work with water wheels [ citation needed ] led him to work with Matthew Boulton and James Watt for whom by 1790 he was agent in Manchester . At the same time as acting as agent he was also trading on his own account as a millwright , enabling him to provide the complementary shafts, gears and other necessities to harness the power of the Boulton & Watt steam engines.

[ 1 ] In 1792, frustrated in administering the immature and, as yet, unreliable machinery, [ citation needed ] he left Boulton and Watt to work in partnership with Samuel Oldknow in a cotton bleaching and calico printing venture. He anticipated this being a profitable concern but the partnership was dissolved within a year and he returned to engineering.

[ 1 ] In 1798 he went into partnership with Samuel Greg , [ 1 ] installing an innovative water wheel at Greg's Quarry Bank Mill on the River Bollin in Cheshire . As a standby, he installed a Watt steam engine [ citation needed ] .

By 1811, Ewart had abandoned the venture with Greg to concentrate on his own manufacturing business but also his scientific work. He became, along with John Dalton , a vice-president of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society and became active in the contemporary controversies about heat , work and energy . Motivated by a paper of John Playfair and encouraged by Dalton, in 1813 he published "On the measure of moving force " in which he defended the nascent ideas of the conservation of energy championed by John Smeaton . The paper was strongly to influence Dalton's pupil James Prescott Joule . A vocal advocate of the application of scientific knowledge in engineering, he was one of the founders of the Manchester Mechanics' Institute .

Ewart took up the post of Chief Engineer and Chief Inspector of Machinery with the Admiralty in 1835 [ 1 ] and died on 15 September 1842 at Woolwich Dockyard when a chain snapped as he was supervising the removal of a boiler.
