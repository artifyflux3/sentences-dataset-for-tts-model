Table showing quantitative relationships between common units of time

A **unit of time** is any particular [time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time "Time") interval, used as a standard way of measuring or expressing duration. The [base unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI_base_unit "SI base unit") of time in the [International System of Units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units "International System of Units") (SI), and by extension most of the [Western world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world "Western world"), is the [second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second "Second"), defined as about 9 billion oscillations of the [caesium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesium "Caesium") atom. The exact modern SI definition is "[The second] is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the cesium frequency, Δ _ν_ Cs, the unperturbed ground-state hyperfine transition frequency of the cesium 133 atom, to be 9 192 631 770 when expressed in the unit Hz, which is equal to s−1."[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_of_time#cite_note-1)

Historically, many units of time were defined by the movements of [astronomical objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_object "Astronomical object").

*   [Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun "Sun")-based: the [year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year "Year") is based on the [Earth's orbital period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_orbit "Earth's orbit") around the sun. Historical year-based units include the [Olympiad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympiad "Olympiad") (four years), the [lustrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lustrum "Lustrum") (five years), the [indiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiction "Indiction") (15 years), the [decade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decade "Decade"), the [century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century "Century"), and the [millennium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium "Millennium").
*   [Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon "Moon")-based: the [month](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Month "Month") is based on the [Moon's orbital period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_of_the_Moon "Orbit of the Moon") around the Earth.
*   [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth")-based: the [day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day "Day") is based on the time it takes for the Earth to rotate on its own axis, relative to the Sun. Units originally derived from this base include the [week](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Week "Week") (seven days), and the [fortnight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortnight "Fortnight") (14 days). Subdivisions of the day include the [hour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour "Hour") (1/24 of a day), which is further subdivided into [minutes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute "Minute") and seconds. The second is the international standard unit (SI unit) for science.
*   [Celestial sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_sphere "Celestial sphere")-based: as in [sidereal time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidereal_time "Sidereal time"), where the apparent movement of the stars and [constellations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellations "Constellations") across the sky is used to calculate the length of a year.

These units do not have a consistent relationship with each other and require [intercalation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercalation_(timekeeping) "Intercalation (timekeeping)"). For example, the year cannot be divided into twelve 28-day months since 12 times 28 is 336, well short of 365. The [lunar month](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_month "Lunar month") (as defined by the moon's rotation) is not 28 days but 28.3 days. The year, defined in the [Gregorian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar "Gregorian calendar") as 365.2425 days has to be adjusted with [leap days](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_days "Leap days") and [leap seconds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_seconds "Leap seconds"). Consequently, these units are now all defined for scientific purposes as multiples of seconds.

Units of time based on [orders of magnitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(Orders_of_magnitude) "Time (Orders of magnitude)") of the second follow the system of [metric prefixes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_prefix "Metric prefix").

The natural units for timekeeping used by most historical societies are the [day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day "Day"), the [solar year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_year "Solar year") and the [lunation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunation "Lunation"). Such calendars include the [Sumerian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumerian_calendar "Sumerian calendar"), [Egyptian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_calendar "Egyptian calendar"), [Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_calendar "Chinese calendar"), [Babylonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_calendar "Babylonian calendar"), [ancient Athenian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attic_calendar "Attic calendar"), [Buddhist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist_calendar "Buddhist calendar"), [Hindu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_calendar "Hindu calendar"), [Islamic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_calendar "Islamic calendar"), [Icelandic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icelandic_calendar "Icelandic calendar"), [Mayan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayan_calendar "Mayan calendar"), and [French Republican](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Republican_calendar "French Republican calendar") calendars.

The modern calendar has its origins in the [Roman calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_calendar "Roman calendar"), which evolved into the [Julian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_calendar "Julian calendar"), and then the [Gregorian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar "Gregorian calendar").

*   The [Planck time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_time "Planck time") is the time that light takes to travel one [Planck length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_length "Planck length").
*   The [Jiffy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiffy_(time) "Jiffy (time)") is the amount of time light takes to travel one [femtometre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femtometre "Femtometre") (about the diameter of a [nucleon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleon "Nucleon")).
*   The [atomic time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_units "Atomic units") relates to the orbital period of a ground state [electron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron "Electron") around a [hydrogen atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_atom "Hydrogen atom") and is about 24.2 attoseconds.
*   The [svedberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svedberg "Svedberg") is a time unit used for [sedimentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedimentation "Sedimentation") rates (usually of proteins). It is defined as 10−13 seconds (100 fs).
*   The [TU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TU_(time_unit) "TU (time unit)") (for _time unit_) is a unit of time defined as 1024 μs for use in engineering.
*   The [galactic year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_year "Galactic year"), based on the rotation of the galaxy and usually measured in million years.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_of_time#cite_note-StarChild-2)
*   The [geological time scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_time_scale "Geological time scale") relates [stratigraphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratigraphy "Stratigraphy") to time. The [deep time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_time "Deep time") of Earth's past is divided into units according to events that took place in each period. For example, the boundary between the [Cretaceous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous "Cretaceous") period and the [Paleogene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleogene "Paleogene") period is defined by the [Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous%E2%80%93Paleogene_extinction_event "Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event"). The largest unit is the supereon, composed of eons. Eons are divided into [eras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Era_(geology) "Era (geology)"), which are in turn divided into [periods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Period_(geology) "Period (geology)"), [epochs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch_(geology) "Epoch (geology)") and [ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_(geology) "Age (geology)"). It is not a true mathematical unit, as all ages, epochs, periods, eras, or eons don't have the same length; instead, their length is determined by the geological and historical events that define them individually.

Note: The [light-year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-year "Light-year") is not a unit of time, but a unit of length of about 9.5 petametres (9 454 254 955 488 km).

Note: The [parsec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec "Parsec") is not a unit of time, but a unit of length of about 30.9 trillion kilometres, despite [movie references](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Falcon#Kessel_Run "Millennium Falcon") otherwise.

Flowchart illustrating selected units of time. The graphic also shows the three celestial objects that are related to the units of time.

All of the formal units of time are scaled multiples of each other. The most common units are the second, defined in terms of an atomic process; the day, an integral multiple of seconds; and the [year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year "Year"), usually 365 days. The other units used are multiples or divisions of these 3.
