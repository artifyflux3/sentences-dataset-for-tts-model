[ 16 ] [ 17 ] In 2019, when Hegde was invited to deliver a lecture on "Sauce of Happiness" at the campus of Indian Institute of Technology , Madras , he was called a proponent of "pseudo-science and quackery" by a group of research scholars, who questioned his criticism of modern medicine and accused him of promoting unverified treatments for various ailments.

[ 18 ] Hegde said it showed "how much the protesters knew about science." [ 19 ] His TEDx talk on "Change is life" was flagged by TED as containing medical fallacies and sweeping generalizations. TED said that the assertions made in the talk lacked legitimate scientific support.

[ 20 ] Hegde has also written articles and given talks in support of homeopathy , regarded globally as a pseudoscience .

[ 5 ] Hegde argues that even if one thinks incorrectly that Homeopathy is a placebo , it is still important, as most modern medicine is worse than placebo.

Yet homeopathy is a paradigmatic example of pseudoscience. It is neither simply bad science nor science fraud, but rather profoundly departs from scientific method and theories while being described as scientific by some of its adherents (often sincerely).

Quantum healing is what happens when your own volition can make it happen during the oscillation between matter and energy to rebuild the damaged part ... Auto-healing, akin to quantum healing, brings one back to normalcy. This alone can be called cure.
