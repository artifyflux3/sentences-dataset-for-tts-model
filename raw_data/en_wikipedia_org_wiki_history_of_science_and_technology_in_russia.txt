In the 19th and 20th centuries, Russia produced many notable scientists , making important contributions in physics , astronomy , mathematics , computing , chemistry , biology , geology and geography .

Russian inventors and engineers excelled in such areas as electrical engineering , shipbuilding , aerospace , weaponry , communications , IT , nuclear technology and space technology .

The crisis of the 1990s led to the drastic reduction of state support for science and technology, leading many Russian scientists and university graduates to move to Western Europe or the United States. In the 2000s, on the wave of a new economic boom, the situation has improved, and the Russian government launched a campaign aimed into modernisation and innovation with mixed success.

[ citation needed ] History [ edit ] Main articles: Timeline of Russian inventions and technology records , Russian scientists , and Russian inventors Mikhail Lomonosov , Russian polymath scientist, inventor, poet and artist, the founder of Moscow State University At the start of the 18th century the reforms of Peter the Great (founder of the Russian Academy of Sciences and Saint Petersburg State University) and the work of such champions as polymath Mikhail Lomonosov (the founder of Moscow State University) gave a great boost to the development of science and innovation in Russia.

Many famous Russian scientists and inventors were émigrés , like Igor Sikorsky , credited with the invention of the first helicopters, Vladimir Zworykin , often called the father of TV, chemist Ilya Prigogine , noted for his work on dissipative structures and complex systems (1977 Nobel Prize for Chemistry ), economists Simon Kuznets (1971 Nobel Prize ) and Wassily Leontief (1973 Nobel Prize ), physicist Georgiy Gamov (an author of the Big Bang theory), engineer Alexander M. Poniatoff , who created the world's first rotary head recorder and social scientist Pitirim Sorokin who played an important role in development of sociology in the US. Many foreigners such as Leonhard Euler and Alfred Nobel worked in Russia for a long time.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Despite many technological achievements in the 19th and 20th centuries, since the time of Brezhnev stagnation Russia has lagged significantly behind the West in a number of technologies, especially those concerning energy conservation and consumer goods production. The crisis of the 1990s led to the drastic reduction of state support for science. Many Russian scientists and university graduates left Russia for Europe or United States; this migration is known as a " brain drain ".

In the 2000s, on the wave of a new economic boom, the situation in the Russian science and technology has improved, and the government launched a campaign to encourage modernisation and innovation. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev formulated the top five priorities for the country's technological development: energy efficiency , IT (including both common products and the products combined with space technology ), nuclear energy and pharmaceuticals .

[ citation needed ] Some progress already has been achieved, with Russia's having nearly completed GLONASS , the only global satellite navigation system apart from American GPS , European Galileo and Chinese BeiDou , and Russia's being the only country constructing mobile nuclear plants .

In 2022, due to the Russo-Ukrainian War , tens of thousands of tech workers fled Russia causing a brain drain .

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] In 2024, the website of the science journal Science reported that Russia has experienced a multi-year brain drain in the science profession and that salaries are falling in the Russian scientific community.

[ 5 ] In addition, the Russo-Ukrainian War caused many international scientific agreements between Russia and Western countries to be ended, including those related to the utilization of scientific infrastructure.

[ 6 ] Russia ranked 59th in the Global Innovation Index in 2024, down from 45th in 2021.

Rostec headquarters in Moscow The history of Russian aircraft engineering begins with a pioneer of aviation Alexander Mozhaysky who made his first attempt to fly in an aircraft ( monoplane ) of his own design as early as in 1881. In the 20th century a number of prominent Soviet aerospace engineers, inspired by the fundamental works of Nikolai Zhukovsky and Sergei Chaplygin among others, supervised the creation of many dozens of models of military and civilian aircraft and founded a number of KBs ( Construction Bureaus ) that now constitute the bulk of Russia's United Aircraft Corporation . A number of individual inventors also made important contributions to aircraft technology, such as Gleb Kotelnikov who invented the knapsack parachute , or Evgeniy Chertovsky who introduced the pressure suit . Theoretical works by Petr Ufimtsev played a critical role in development of stealth technology .

Famous Russian airplanes include the first supersonic passenger jet Tupolev Tu-144 by Alexei Tupolev , MiG fighter aircraft series by Artem Mikoyan and Mikhail Gurevich , and Su series by Pavel Sukhoi and his followers. The MiG-15 is the jet aircraft with the world's highest production in history, while MiG-21 is the most produced supersonic aircraft . Since the World War II era the Ilyushin Il-2 bomber remains the most produced military aircraft in history . The Polikarpov Po-2 Kukuruznik is the world's most produced biplane , and the Mil Mi-8 is the most produced helicopter .

Aircraft manufacturing is one of the most science-intensive high tech sectors of modern Russian economy and employs the largest number of skilled personnel. The production and value of the military aircraft branch far outstrips other defense industry sectors, and aircraft products make up more than half of the country's arms exports.

[ 20 ] The Russian aircraft industry offers a portfolio of internationally competitive military aircraft, while new projects such as the Sukhoi Superjet 100 are hoped to revive the fortunes of the civilian aircraft segment. In 2009, companies belonging to the United Aircraft Corporation delivered 95 new fixed-wing aircraft to its customers, including 15 civilian models. In addition, the industry produced over 141 helicopters.

Space technology [ edit ] Main articles: Soviet space program , Russian Federal Space Agency , and Space industry of Russia Roscosmos is Russia's national space agency; [ 21 ] while Russian achievements in the field of space technology and space exploration are traced back to Konstantin Tsiolkovsky , the father of theoretical astronautics .

[ 22 ] His works had inspired leading Soviet rocket engineers, such as Sergey Korolyov , Valentin Glushko , and many others who contributed to the success of the Soviet space program in the early stages of the Space Race and beyond.

In 1957, the first Earth-orbiting artificial satellite , Sputnik 1 , was launched.

[ 23 ] In 1961, the first human trip into space was successfully made by Yuri Gagarin .

[ 24 ] Many other Soviet and Russian space exploration records ensued, including the first spacewalk performed by Alexei Leonov .

[ 25 ] Vostok 6 was the first human spaceflight to carry a woman into space ( Valentina Tereshkova ).

[ 26 ] Luna 9 was the first spacecraft to land on the Moon , [ 27 ] Sputnik 2 was the first spacecraft to carry an animal ( Laika ), [ 28 ] Zond 5 brought the first Earthlings (two tortoises and other life forms) to circumnavigate the Moon, [ 29 ] Venera 7 was the first spacecraft to land on another planet ( Venus ), [ 30 ] and Mars 3 was the first spacecraft to land on Mars .

[ 31 ] Lunokhod 1 was the first space exploration rover , [ 32 ] and Salyut 1 was the world's first space station .

[ 33 ] Russia is among the world's largest satellite launchers, [ 34 ] and has completed the GLONASS satellite navigation system . It is developing its own fifth-generation jet fighter ( Sukhoi Su-57 ), [ 35 ] and has built the world's first floating nuclear power plant .

[ 36 ] Luna-Glob is a Russian Moon exploration programme, with its first mission scheduled to launch in October 2021 ( Luna 25 ).

[ 37 ] To replace the ageing Soyuz , Roscosmos is also developing the Orel spacecraft , which could conduct its first crewed fight in 2025.

[ 38 ] In February 2019, it was announced that Russia is intending to conduct its first crewed mission to land on the Moon in 2031.

[ 39 ] In April 2021, Roscosmos declared that it is planning to quit the ISS , and will create its own space station with the aim of launching it into orbit by 2030.

[ 40 ] In June 2021, Roscosmos and China National Space Administration announced that they are jointly developing a lunar base , which is planned to be utilized from 2036.

[ 41 ] Military [ edit ] Main articles: Defence industry of Russia , Rosoboronexport , and List of Russian weaponry makers Famous Russian battle tanks include the T-34 , a well-regarded middle tank design of World War II, [ 42 ] and further tanks of the T-series, including the most produced tank in history, the T-54/55 , [ 43 ] the first fully gas turbine tank T-80 , and the most modern Russian tanks T-90 and T-14 Armata . The AK-47 and AK-74 by Mikhail Kalashnikov constitute the most widely used type of assault rifle throughout the world—so much so that more AK-type rifles have been manufactured than all other assault rifles combined.

[ 44 ] [ 45 ] With these and other weapons Russia for a long time has been among the world's top arms suppliers , accounting for around 30% of worldwide weapons sales [ 46 ] and exporting weapons to about 80 countries.

[ citation needed ] The defence industry of Russia is a strategically important sector and a large employer. Russia is the second largest conventional arms exporter after the United States, with $8 billions' worth of exports in 2008. The most popular types of weaponry bought from Russia are Sukhoi and MiG fighters, air defense systems, helicopters, tanks , armored personnel carriers and infantry fighting vehicles .

[ citation needed ] Aviation products make up about half of the country's arms exports.

[ citation needed ] One of the industry's recent technological achievements was the maiden flight of the fifth generation fighter Sukhoi Su-57 , which broke the United States' complete monopoly on development and production of fifth generation jets. The Moscow Defense Brief journal hailed the occasion as a major coup for Russia's defence industry, saying that: {W}hile not America’s equal militarily, Russia is still a solid second in terms of defense technology, outranking both Western Europe and China and punching well above its economic weight.

[ 47 ] Computing [ edit ] Main article: Information technology in Russia Sergei Lebedev developed one of the first universally programmable computers in continental Europe in 1950, MESM . The first ternary computer Setun was developed by Nikolay Brusentsov , together with Sergei Sobolev in 1958.
