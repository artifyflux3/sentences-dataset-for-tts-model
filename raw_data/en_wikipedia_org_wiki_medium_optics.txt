For the hypothetical medium for transmitting light waves, see Luminiferous aether .

In optics , an optical medium is material through which light and other electromagnetic waves propagate.  It is a form of transmission medium .  The permittivity and permeability of the medium define how electromagnetic waves propagate in it.

Properties [ edit ] The optical medium has an intrinsic impedance , given by η η = E x H y {\displaystyle \eta ={E_{x} \over H_{y}}} where E x {\displaystyle E_{x}} and H y {\displaystyle H_{y}} are the electric field and magnetic field , respectively.
In a region with no electrical conductivity , the expression simplifies to: η η = μ μ ε ε .

{\displaystyle \eta ={\sqrt {\mu  \over \varepsilon }}\ .} For example, in free space the intrinsic impedance is called the characteristic impedance of vacuum , denoted Z 0 , and Z 0 = μ μ 0 ε ε 0 .

{\displaystyle Z_{0}={\sqrt {\mu _{0} \over \varepsilon _{0}}}\ .} Waves propagate through a medium with velocity c w = ν ν λ λ {\displaystyle c_{w}=\nu \lambda } , where ν ν {\displaystyle \nu } is the frequency and λ λ {\displaystyle \lambda } is the wavelength of the electromagnetic waves. This equation also may be put in the form c w = ω ω k , {\displaystyle c_{w}={\omega  \over k}\ ,} where ω ω {\displaystyle \omega } is the angular frequency of the wave and k {\displaystyle k} is the wavenumber of the wave. In electrical engineering , the symbol β β {\displaystyle \beta } , called the phase constant , is often used instead of k {\displaystyle k} .

The propagation velocity of electromagnetic waves in free space , an idealized standard reference state (like absolute zero for temperature), is conventionally denoted by c 0 : [ 1 ] c 0 = 1 ε ε 0 μ μ 0 , {\displaystyle c_{0}={1 \over {\sqrt {\varepsilon _{0}\mu _{0}}}}\ ,} where ε ε 0 {\displaystyle \varepsilon _{0}} is the electric constant and μ μ 0 {\displaystyle ~\mu _{0}\ } is the magnetic constant .
