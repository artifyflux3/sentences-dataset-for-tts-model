The current results from the movement of water flowing around the southernmost point of Greenland caused by the East Greenland Current .

According to Lloyd et al., 2007, the WGC is a WARM current connected to a broader scale North Atlantic climate via the combined influences of Atlantic water from the Irminger Current (IC) and polar water from the East Greenland Current.

[ 1 ] Paleoclimatology records derived from foraminifera abundance show that periodic influxes of warm subsurface temperatures and near-bottom temperatures occurred throughout the Late Holocene epoch, particularly during the Holocene climatic optimum . The increased flow from the nearby East Greenland Current was associated with increased glacial iceberg calving from the large Jacobshavn Isbræ glacial outlet within the western Greenland Ice Sheet , causing rapid melting and destabilization events. Following the Neoglaciation , the Jacobshavn outlet formed a floating ice tongue around 2000 years before present.
