He is director of the Institute of High Energy Physics (IHEP) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing and known for contributions to neutrino physics, in particular his leading role (with Kam-Biu Luk ) at Daya Bay Reactor Neutrino Experiment to determine the last unknown neutrino mixing angle θ 13 (see neutrino ).

[ 1 ] After earning his bachelor's degree in physics at Nanjing University (1984) he was with Samuel CC Ting at the L3 experiment the Large Electron-Positron Collider (LEP) of CERN . Wang worked and studied at the University of Florence obtaining PhD in Physics, [ 2 ] then worked at Laboratory for Nuclear Science of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and at Stanford University [ 3 ] and joined the Institute of High Energy Physics(IHEP), China in 2001 as a researcher and became the Director in 2011.
