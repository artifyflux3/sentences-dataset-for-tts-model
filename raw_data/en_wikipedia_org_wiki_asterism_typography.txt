The name originates from the astronomical term for a group of stars .

[ 1 ] The asterism was originally used as a type of dinkus in typography, though increasingly rarely.

[ 2 ] It can also be used to mean "untitled" or author or title withheld –  as seen, for example, in some editions of Album for the Young by composer Robert Schumann ( № 21, 26, and 30).

[ 3 ] In meteorology , an asterism in a station model plot indicates moderate snowfall.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] Dinkus [ edit ] Main article: Dinkus Asterisms used as dinkuses in the James Joyce novel Ulysses , the "Wandering Rocks" chapter, from the 1922 edition.

[ 6 ] The 1961 edition used a hollow white star (☆), and the 1984 edition used a row of three asterisks.

A dinkus is a typographical device to divide text, such as at section breaks . Its purpose is to "indicate minor breaks in text", [ 7 ] to call attention to a passage, or to separate sub-chapters in a book. An asterism used this way is thus a type of dinkus: nowadays this usage of the symbol is nearly obsolete.

[ 2 ] More commonly used dinkuses are three dots or three asterisks in a horizontal row.
