In chemistry , a heteroatom (from Ancient Greek heteros ' different ' and atomos ' uncut ' ) is, strictly, any atom that is not carbon or hydrogen .

[ 1 ] Organic chemistry [ edit ] In practice, the term is mainly used more specifically to indicate that non-carbon atoms have replaced carbon in the backbone of the molecular structure . Typical heteroatoms are nitrogen (N), oxygen (O), sulfur (S), phosphorus (P), chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), and iodine (I), [ 2 ] [ 3 ] as well as the metals lithium (Li) and magnesium (Mg).

Proteins [ edit ] It can also be used with highly specific meanings in specialised contexts. In the description of protein structure, in particular in the Protein Data Bank file format, a heteroatom record (HETATM) describes an atom as belonging to a small molecule cofactor rather than being part of a biopolymer chain.

[ 4 ] Zeolites [ edit ] In the context of zeolites , the term heteroatom refers to partial isomorphous substitution of the typical framework atoms ( silicon , aluminium , and phosphorus ) by other elements such as beryllium , vanadium , and chromium .

[ 5 ] The goal is usually to adjust properties of the material (e.g., Lewis acidity ) to optimize the material for a certain application (e.g., catalysis ).
