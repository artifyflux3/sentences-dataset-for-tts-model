The standard torus is homogeneous under its diffeomorphism and homeomorphism groups, and the flat torus is homogeneous under its diffeomorphism, homeomorphism, and isometry groups .

In mathematics , a homogeneous space is, very informally, a space that looks the same everywhere, as you move through it, with movement given by the action of a group . Homogeneous spaces occur in the theories of Lie groups , algebraic groups and topological groups . More precisely, a homogeneous space for a group G is a non-empty manifold or topological space X on which G acts transitively .  The elements of G are called the symmetries of X . A special case of this is when the group G in question is the automorphism group of the space X – here "automorphism group" can mean isometry group , diffeomorphism group , or homeomorphism group . In this case, X is homogeneous if intuitively X looks locally the same at each point, either in the sense of isometry (rigid geometry), diffeomorphism ( differential geometry ), or homeomorphism ( topology ). Some authors insist that the action of G be faithful (non-identity elements act non-trivially), although the present article does not. Thus there is a group action of G on X that can be thought of as preserving some "geometric structure" on X , and making X into a single G -orbit .

Formal definition [ edit ] Let X be a non-empty set and G a group. Then X is called a G -space if it is equipped with an action of G on X .

[ 1 ] Note that automatically G acts by automorphisms (bijections) on the set. If X in addition belongs to some category , then the elements of G are assumed to act as automorphisms in the same category. That is, the maps on X coming from elements of G preserve the structure associated with the category (for example, if X is an object in Diff then the action is required to be by diffeomorphisms ). A homogeneous space is a G -space on which G acts transitively.

If X is an object of the category C , then the structure of a G -space is a homomorphism : ρ ρ : G → → A u t C ( X ) {\displaystyle \rho :G\to \mathrm {Aut} _{\mathbf {C} }(X)} into the group of automorphisms of the object X in the category C . The pair ( X , ρ ) defines a homogeneous space provided ρ ( G ) is a transitive group of symmetries of the underlying set of X .

Examples [ edit ] For example, if X is a topological space , then group elements are assumed to act as homeomorphisms on X . The structure of a G -space is a group homomorphism ρ : G → Homeo( X ) into the homeomorphism group of X .

Similarly, if X is a differentiable manifold , then the group elements are diffeomorphisms . The structure of a G -space is a group homomorphism ρ : G → Diffeo( X ) into the diffeomorphism group of X .

Riemannian symmetric spaces are an important class of homogeneous spaces, and include many of the examples listed below.

Concrete examples include: Examples of homogeneous spaces space X group G stabilizer H spherical space S n −1 O( n ) O( n − 1) oriented S n −1 SO( n ) SO( n − 1) projective space P R n −1 PO( n ) PO( n − 1) Euclidean space E n E( n ) O( n ) oriented E n E + ( n ) SO( n ) hyperbolic space H n O + (1, n ) O( n ) oriented H n SO + (1, n ) SO( n ) anti-de Sitter space AdS n +1 O(2, n ) O(1, n ) Grassmannian Gr( r , n ) O( n ) O( r ) × O( n − r ) affine space A( n , K ) Aff( n , K ) GL( n , K ) Isometry groups Positive curvature: Sphere ( orthogonal group ): S n −1 ≅ O( n ) / O( n −1) . This is true because of the following observations: First, S n −1 is the set of vectors in R n with norm 1. If we consider one of these vectors as a base vector, then any other vector can be constructed using an orthogonal transformation. If we consider the span of this vector as a one dimensional subspace of R n , then the complement is an ( n − 1) -dimensional vector space that is invariant under an orthogonal transformation from O( n − 1) . This shows us why we can construct S n −1 as a homogeneous space.

Oriented sphere ( special orthogonal group ): S n −1 ≅ SO( n ) / SO( n − 1) Projective space ( projective orthogonal group ): P n −1 ≅ PO( n ) / PO( n − 1) Flat (zero curvature): Euclidean space ( Euclidean group , point stabilizer is orthogonal group): E n ≅ E( n ) / O( n ) Negative curvature: Hyperbolic space ( orthochronous Lorentz group , point stabilizer orthogonal group, corresponding to hyperboloid model ): H n ≅ O + (1, n ) / O( n ) Oriented hyperbolic space: SO + (1, n ) / SO( n ) Anti-de Sitter space : AdS n +1 = O(2, n ) / O(1, n ) Others Affine space over field K (for affine group , point stabilizer general linear group ): A n = Aff( n , K ) / GL( n , K ) .

Grassmannian : Gr( r , n ) = O( n ) / (O( r ) × O( n − r )) Topological vector spaces (in the sense of topology) There are other interesting homogeneous spaces, in particular with relevance in physics: This includes Minkowski space M n ≅ ISO( n-1,1 ) / SO( n,1 ) or Galilean and Carrollian spaces.

[ 2 ] Geometry [ edit ] From the point of view of the Erlangen program , one may understand that "all points are the same", in the geometry of X . This was true of essentially all geometries proposed before Riemannian geometry , in the middle of the nineteenth century.

Thus, for example, Euclidean space , affine space and projective space are all in natural ways homogeneous spaces for their respective symmetry groups . The same is true of the models found of non-Euclidean geometry of constant curvature , such as hyperbolic space .

A further classical example is the space of lines in projective space of three dimensions (equivalently, the space of two-dimensional subspaces of a four-dimensional vector space ). It is simple linear algebra to show that GL 4 acts transitively on those. We can parameterize them by line co-ordinates : these are the 2×2 minors of the 4×2 matrix with columns two basis vectors for the subspace. The geometry of the resulting homogeneous space is the line geometry of Julius Plücker .

Homogeneous spaces as coset spaces [ edit ] In general, if X is a homogeneous space of G , and H o is the stabilizer of some marked point o in X (a choice of origin ), the points of X correspond to the left cosets G / H o , and the marked point o corresponds to the coset of the identity. Conversely, given a coset space G / H , it is a homogeneous space for G with a distinguished point, namely the coset of the identity. Thus a homogeneous space can be thought of as a coset space without a choice of origin.

For example, if H is the identity subgroup { e }, then X is the G -torsor , which explains why G -torsors are often described intuitively as " G with forgotten identity".

In general, a different choice of origin o will lead to a quotient of G by a different subgroup H o′ that is related to H o by an inner automorphism of G .  Specifically, H o ′ = g H o g − − 1 {\displaystyle H_{o'}=gH_{o}g^{-1}} 1 where g is any element of G for which go = o ′ . Note that the inner automorphism (1) does not depend on which such g is selected; it depends only on g modulo H o .

If the action of G on X is continuous and X is Hausdorff , then H is a closed subgroup of G . In particular, if G is a Lie group , then H is a Lie subgroup by Cartan's theorem .  Hence G / H is a smooth manifold and so X carries a unique smooth structure compatible with the group action.

One can go further to double coset spaces, notably Clifford–Klein forms Γ\ G / H , where Γ is a discrete subgroup (of G ) acting properly discontinuously .

Example [ edit ] For example, in the line geometry case, we can identify H as a 12-dimensional subgroup of the 16-dimensional general linear group , GL(4), defined by conditions on the matrix entries h 13 = h 14 = h 23 = h 24 = 0, by looking for the stabilizer of the subspace spanned by the first two standard basis vectors. That shows that X has dimension 4.

Since the homogeneous coordinates given by the minors are 6 in number, this means that the latter are not independent of each other. In fact, a single quadratic relation holds between the six minors, as was known to nineteenth-century geometers.

This example was the first known example of a Grassmannian , other than a projective space. There are many further homogeneous spaces of the classical linear groups in common use in mathematics.

Prehomogeneous vector spaces [ edit ] The idea of a prehomogeneous vector space was introduced by Mikio Sato .

It is a finite-dimensional vector space V with a group action of an algebraic group G , such that there is an orbit of G that is open for the Zariski topology (and so, dense). An example is GL(1) acting on a one-dimensional space.

The definition is more restrictive than it initially appears: such spaces have remarkable properties, and there is a classification of irreducible prehomogeneous vector spaces, up to a transformation known as "castling".

Homogeneous spaces in physics [ edit ] Given the Poincaré group G and its subgroup the Lorentz group H , the space of cosets G / H is the Minkowski space .

[ 3 ] Together with de Sitter space and anti-de Sitter space these are the maximally symmetric lorentzian spacetimes. There are also homogeneous spaces of relevance in physics that are non-lorentzian, for example Galilean, Carrollian or Aristotelian spacetimes.

[ 2 ] Physical cosmology using the general theory of relativity makes use of the Bianchi classification system. Homogeneous spaces in relativity represent the space part of background metrics for some cosmological models ; for example, the three cases of the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric may be represented by subsets of the Bianchi I (flat), V (open), VII (flat or open) and IX (closed) types, while the Mixmaster universe represents an anisotropic example of a Bianchi IX cosmology.

[ 4 ] A homogeneous space of N dimensions admits a set of ⁠ 1 / 2 ⁠ N ( N + 1) Killing vectors .

[ 5 ] For three dimensions, this gives a total of six linearly independent Killing vector fields; homogeneous 3-spaces have the property that one may use linear combinations of these to find three everywhere non-vanishing Killing vector fields ξ ( a ) i , ξ ξ [ i ; k ] ( a ) = C b c a ξ ξ i ( b ) ξ ξ k ( c ) , {\displaystyle \xi _{[i;k]}^{(a)}=C_{\ bc}^{a}\xi _{i}^{(b)}\xi _{k}^{(c)},} where the object C a bc , the " structure constants ", form a constant order-three tensor antisymmetric in its lower two indices (on the left-hand side, the brackets denote antisymmetrisation and ";" represents the covariant differential operator ). In the case of a flat isotropic universe , one possibility is C a bc = 0 (type I), but in the case of a closed FLRW universe, C a bc = ε a bc , where ε a bc is the Levi-Civita symbol .
