In mathematics , the concept of a generalised metric is a generalisation of that of a metric , in which the distance is not a real number but taken from an arbitrary ordered field .

In general, when we define metric space the distance function is taken to be a real-valued function . The real numbers form an ordered field which is Archimedean and order complete . These metric spaces have some nice properties like: in a metric space compactness , sequential compactness and countable compactness are equivalent etc. These properties may not, however, hold so easily if the distance function is taken in an arbitrary ordered field, instead of in R .

{\displaystyle \scriptstyle \mathbb {R} .} Preliminary definition [ edit ] Let ( F , + , ⋅ ⋅ , < ) {\displaystyle (F,+,\cdot ,<)} be an arbitrary ordered field, and M {\displaystyle M} a nonempty set; a function d : M × × M → → F + ∪ ∪ { 0 } {\displaystyle d:M\times M\to F^{+}\cup \{0\}} is called a metric on M , {\displaystyle M,} if the following conditions hold: d ( x , y ) = 0 {\displaystyle d(x,y)=0} if and only if x = y {\displaystyle x=y} ; d ( x , y ) = d ( y , x ) {\displaystyle d(x,y)=d(y,x)} (symmetry); d ( x , y ) + d ( y , z ) ≥ ≥ d ( x , z ) {\displaystyle d(x,y)+d(y,z)\geq d(x,z)} (triangle inequality).

It is not difficult to verify that the open balls B ( x , δ δ ) := { y ∈ ∈ M : d ( x , y ) < δ δ } {\displaystyle B(x,\delta )\;:=\{y\in M\;:d(x,y)<\delta \}} form a basis for a suitable topology, the latter called the metric topology on M , {\displaystyle M,} with the metric in F .

{\displaystyle F.} Since F {\displaystyle F} in its order topology is monotonically normal , we would expect M {\displaystyle M} to be at least regular .

Further properties [ edit ] However, under axiom of choice , every general metric is monotonically normal , for, given x ∈ ∈ G , {\displaystyle x\in G,} where G {\displaystyle G} is open, there is an open ball B ( x , δ δ ) {\displaystyle B(x,\delta )} such that x ∈ ∈ B ( x , δ δ ) ⊆ ⊆ G .

{\displaystyle x\in B(x,\delta )\subseteq G.} Take μ μ ( x , G ) = B ( x , δ δ / 2 ) .

{\displaystyle \mu (x,G)=B\left(x,\delta /2\right).} Verify the conditions for Monotone Normality.

The matter of wonder is that, even without choice, general metrics are monotonically normal .

proof .

Case I: F {\displaystyle F} is an Archimedean field .

Now, if x {\displaystyle x} in G , G {\displaystyle G,G} open, we may take μ μ ( x , G ) := B ( x , 1 / 2 n ( x , G ) ) , {\displaystyle \mu (x,G):=B(x,1/2n(x,G)),} where n ( x , G ) := min { n ∈ ∈ N : B ( x , 1 / n ) ⊆ ⊆ G } , {\displaystyle n(x,G):=\min\{n\in \mathbb {N} :B(x,1/n)\subseteq G\},} and the trick is done without choice.

Case II: F {\displaystyle F} is a non-Archimedean field.

For given x ∈ ∈ G {\displaystyle x\in G} where G {\displaystyle G} is open, consider the set A ( x , G ) := { a ∈ ∈ F : for all n ∈ ∈ N , B ( x , n ⋅ ⋅ a ) ⊆ ⊆ G } .

{\displaystyle A(x,G):=\{a\in F:{\text{ for all }}n\in \mathbb {N} ,B(x,n\cdot a)\subseteq G\}.} The set A ( x , G ) {\displaystyle A(x,G)} is non-empty. For, as G {\displaystyle G} is open, there is an open ball B ( x , k ) {\displaystyle B(x,k)} within G .

{\displaystyle G.} Now, as F {\displaystyle F} is non-Archimdedean, N F {\displaystyle \mathbb {N} _{F}} is not bounded above, hence there is some ξ ξ ∈ ∈ F {\displaystyle \xi \in F} such that for all n ∈ ∈ N , {\displaystyle n\in \mathbb {N} ,} n ⋅ ⋅ 1 ≤ ≤ ξ ξ .

{\displaystyle n\cdot 1\leq \xi .} Putting a = k ⋅ ⋅ ( 2 ξ ξ ) − − 1 , {\displaystyle a=k\cdot (2\xi )^{-1},} we see that a {\displaystyle a} is in A ( x , G ) .

{\displaystyle A(x,G).} Now define μ μ ( x , G ) = ⋃ ⋃ { B ( x , a ) : a ∈ ∈ A ( x , G ) } .

{\displaystyle \mu (x,G)=\bigcup \{B(x,a):a\in A(x,G)\}.} We would show that with respect to this mu operator, the space is monotonically normal. Note that μ μ ( x , G ) ⊆ ⊆ G .

{\displaystyle \mu (x,G)\subseteq G.} If y {\displaystyle y} is not in G {\displaystyle G} (open set containing x {\displaystyle x} ) and x {\displaystyle x} is not in H {\displaystyle H} (open set containing y {\displaystyle y} ), then we'd show that μ μ ( x , G ) ∩ ∩ μ μ ( y , H ) {\displaystyle \mu (x,G)\cap \mu (y,H)} is empty. If not, say z {\displaystyle z} is in the intersection. Then ∃ ∃ a ∈ ∈ A ( x , G ) : : d ( x , z ) < a ; ∃ ∃ b ∈ ∈ A ( y , H ) : : d ( z , y ) < b .

{\displaystyle \exists a\in A(x,G)\colon d(x,z)<a;\;\;\exists b\in A(y,H)\colon d(z,y)<b.} From the above, we get that d ( x , y ) ≤ ≤ d ( x , z ) + d ( z , y ) < 2 ⋅ ⋅ max { a , b } , {\displaystyle d(x,y)\leq d(x,z)+d(z,y)<2\cdot \max\{a,b\},} which is impossible since this would imply that either y {\displaystyle y} belongs to μ μ ( x , G ) ⊆ ⊆ G {\displaystyle \mu (x,G)\subseteq G} or x {\displaystyle x} belongs to μ μ ( y , H ) ⊆ ⊆ H .

{\displaystyle \mu (y,H)\subseteq H.} This completes the proof.
