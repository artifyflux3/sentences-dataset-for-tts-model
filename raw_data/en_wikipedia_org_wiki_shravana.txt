It belongs to the constellation Makara (Devanagari: मकर), a legendary sea creature resembling a crocodile] or Capricorn . The name alludes to Shravan , a mythological character who attained repute due to his utmost devotion to his aged and blind parents.

Lord Venkateswara of Tirupati and Lord Oppiliappan near Kumbakonam , who married Markandeya Rishi's daughter Bhuvalli, are believed to be born in this Nakshatra in the Bhadrapada maasa.

Onam , the biggest festival of Kerala , is celebrated on this Nakshathra in the Malayalam month of Chingam .

Traditional Hindu given names are determined by which pada (quarter) of a nakshatra the Ascendant/ Lagna was in at the time of birth. In the case of Shravana Nakshatra, the given name would begin with the following syllables: [ 1 ] Khi ( Devanagari : खी) Khu ( Devanagari : खू) Khe ( Devanagari : खे) Kho ( Devanagari : खो) References [ edit ] ^ "Nakshatra Names in Sanskrit, Hindi, Telugu, Tamil, and Malayalam" .
