History [ edit ] Main article: History of Virginia Commonwealth University Further information: List of presidents of Virginia Commonwealth University VCU's history began in 1838 when the Medical Department of Hampden-Sydney College opened in Richmond. In 1844, it moved into its first permanent home, the Egyptian Building . In 1854, the Medical Department of Hampden–Sydney College received an independent charter from the Virginia General Assembly and became the Medical College of Virginia (MCV). A few years later in 1860, MCV conveyed all its property to the Commonwealth of Virginia and becomes a state institution in exchange for $30,000.

As the Civil War began, Richmond became a focal point for battle and politics. After a long siege , Ulysses S. Grant captured Petersburg and Richmond in early April 1865. As the fall of Petersburg became imminent, on Evacuation Sunday (April 2), President Davis , his Cabinet, and the Confederate defenders abandoned Richmond and fled south. The retreating soldiers were under orders to set fire to bridges, the armory , and supply warehouses as they left. The fire in the largely abandoned city spread out of control, and along with Union shelling, large parts of Richmond, and virtually all MCV buildings, were destroyed. The city surrendered the next day; Union troops put out the raging fires in the city. Because of the worthless Confederate currency and high inflation, the medical school sold its ambulance horse for enough money to continue operation.

[ 11 ] After the Civil War MCV participated significantly in medical advances, including in anesthesia and antisepsis.

[ 11 ] In 1893, the College of Physicians and Surgeons, later University College of Medicine, was established by Hunter Holmes McGuire , Stonewall Jackson's friend and personal doctor who had amputated Jackson's arm, just three blocks away from MCV. In 1912, McGuire Hall opened as the new home of the University College of Medicine. The following year, MCV and UCM merged through the efforts of George Ben Johnston and Stuart McGuire. MCV acquired the Memorial Hospital as a result of the merger.

Richmond Professional Institute traces its roots back to 1917, when it began as the Richmond School of Social Work and Public Health. In 1925, it became the Richmond division of The College of William & Mary . In 1939, this division became the Richmond Professional Institute of The College of William & Mary (RPI). In 1947, the MCV Foundation was incorporated and in 1962 RPI separated from William & Mary to become an independent state institution. Then in 1968, state legislation (Wayne Commission Report) merged MCV and RPI to become Virginia Commonwealth University. Descendant of Thomas Jefferson , Pulitzer Prize winner and editor of the Richmond Times-Dispatch , Virginius Dabney was named the first Rector of VCU and went on to write Virginia Commonwealth University: A Sesquicentennial History .

Warren W. Brandt was the first president of VCU. During his tenure, 32 degree programs were added, and the School of Allied Health Professions and the School of Community Services were established. In addition, more than $20 million of new construction was completed or initiated on both campuses, including the James Branch Cabell Library, Rhoads Hall, the School of Business building, the Larrick Student Center and a large addition to Sanger Hall.

[ 13 ] In the 1980s, and under the leadership of VCU President Edmund Ackell,  a major overhaul of the university's governance system and administrative structure was initiated. Ackell lead the administration in instituting a new system for both short-range and long-range university planning; establishing faculty convocation and a new set of faculty tenure and promotion guidelines; and establishing greater access to the community by supporting the use of the university's research and educational resources to meet social needs.

[ 19 ] [ 20 ] The university surpassed $400 million in sponsored research funding. As a result, VCU was designated a top 50 university by the National Science Foundation for research expenditures.

[ 21 ] In 2018, a series of protests by adjunct faculty were held at VCU, over low pay and no benefits.

[ 22 ] [ 23 ] Ahead of the 2018-19 budget, $4.2 million was allocated to increase adjunct faculty funding from $800 to $1,000 per credit hour, about $1,000 less than what the coalition was demanding.

[ 24 ] The administration implemented a campus plan which featured a campus green, arts building, dormitories, general student facilities, and renovations of the historic buildings on campus.

[ 25 ] Students at VCU took part in the 2024 pro-Palestinian protests on university campuses , assembling an encampment in front of the school library in April 2024. After roughly 12 hours, VCU, Richmond and state police violently dispersed the encampment, pepper spraying students and using riot shields and smoke bombs to disperse students and destroy the encampment's temporary structures. VCU closed the library, which is ordinarily open until 3 AM, while the encampment was being dispersed, and locked students inside of it.

[ 26 ] [ 27 ] 13 students were arrested and charged with unlawful assembly, but the charges were later dropped.

[ 28 ] VCU revised its campus policies in the aftermath of the encampment protest, banning forms of political expression including the use of sidewalk chalk and gatherings of more than 50 people [ 29 ] without the university's permission. In 2025, two student leaders [ 30 ] had their degrees withheld.

[ 31 ] One of the students was given her degree back after appealing the disciplinary charges against her.
