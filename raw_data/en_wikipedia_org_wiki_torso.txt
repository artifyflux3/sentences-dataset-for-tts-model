The tetrapod torso — including that of a human — is usually divided into the thoracic segment (also known as the upper torso , where the forelimbs extend), the abdominal segment (also known as the "mid-section" or " midriff "), and the pelvic and perineal segments (sometimes known together with the abdomen as the lower torso , where the hindlimbs extend).

[ 1 ] Anatomy [ edit ] Major organs [ edit ] Surface projections of major organs of the torso, using the vertebral column and rib cage as main reference sources.

In humans, most critical organs , with the notable exception of the brain, are housed within the torso. In the upper chest, the heart and lungs are protected by the rib cage , and the abdomen contains most of the organs responsible for digestion : the stomach , which breaks down partially digested food via gastric acid ; the liver , which respectively produces bile necessary for digestion; the large and small intestines , which extract nutrients from food; the anus , from which fecal wastes are egested; the rectum , which stores feces ; the gallbladder , which stores and concentrates bile; the kidneys , which produce urine , the ureters , which pass it to the bladder for storage; and the urethra , which excretes urine and in a male passes sperm through the seminal vesicles . Finally, the pelvic region houses both the male and female reproductive organs .

Major muscle groups [ edit ] The torso also harbours many of the main groups of muscles in the tetrapod body, including the pectoral , abdominal , lateral and epaxial muscles .

Nerve supply [ edit ] The organs, muscles, and other contents of the torso are supplied by nerves, which mainly originate as nerve roots from the thoracic and lumbar parts of the spinal cord . Some organs also receive a nerve supply from the vagus nerve . The sensation to the skin is provided by the lateral and dorsal cutaneous branches.
