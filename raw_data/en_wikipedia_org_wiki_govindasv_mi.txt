Govindasvāmi (or Govindasvāmin , Govindaswami ) (c. 800 – c. 860) was an Indian mathematical astronomer most famous for his Bhashya , a commentary on the Mahābhāskarīya of Bhāskara I , written around 830. The commentary contains many examples illustrating the use of a Sanskrit place-value system and the construction of a sine table.

[ 1 ] His works have been quoted extensively by Sankaranarayana (fl. 869), Udayadivakara (fl. 1073) and Nilakantha Somayaji (c. 1444-1544). Sankaranarayana was the director of the observatory founded in Mahodayapuram , the capital of the Chera kingdom , and is believed to be the student of Govindasvami. In his book, Sankaranarayana gives explanations to the insightful questions of the king Ravi Varma , then ruler of Mahodayapuram and from these references the period of Sankaranarayana is known.

[ citation needed ] His work Govindakriti was a sequel to Āryabhaṭīya and is lost. Other works attributed to Govindasvami include Govinda-paddhati (on astrology) and Ganita-mukha (on mathematics). Like Govinda-kriti , these are lost, and known only from mentions and quotations by later writers such as Sankaranarayana and Udayadivakara.
