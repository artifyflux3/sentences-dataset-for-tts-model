( June 2010 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) A hybrid word or hybridism is a word that etymologically derives from at least two languages. Such words are a type of macaronic language .

Common hybrids [ edit ] The most common form of hybrid word in English combines Latin and Greek parts. Since many prefixes and suffixes in English are of Latin or Greek etymology , it is straightforward to add a prefix or suffix from one language to an English word that comes from a different language, thus creating a hybrid word.

[ citation needed ] Hybridisms were formerly often considered to be barbarisms .

The following hybrid words consist of a Hebrew-descent word and a non-Semitic descent suffix: [ 15 ] bitkhon-íst ( ביטחוניסט ‎) 'one who evaluates everything from the perspective of national security', from bitakhón 'security' + the productive internationalism -ist khamúda-le ( חמודה׳לה ‎) 'cutie (feminine singular)', from khamuda 'cute (feminine singular) + -le , endearment diminutive of Yiddish origin kiso-lógya ( כיסאולוגיה ‎) 'the art of finding a political seat (especially in the Israeli Parliament)', from kisé 'seat' + the productive internationalism -lógya '-logy' maarav-izátsya ( מערביזציה ‎) 'westernization', from maaráv 'west' + the productive internationalism -izátsya '-ization' (itself via Russian from a hybrid of Greek -ιζ- -iz- and Latin -atio ) miluím-nik ( מילואימניק ‎) 'reservist, reserve soldier', from miluím 'reserve' (literally 'fill-ins') + -nik , a most productive agent suffix of Yiddish and Russian descent The following Modern Hebrew hybrid words have an international prefix: anti-hitnatkút ( אנטי־התנתקות ‎) 'anti-disengagement' post-milkhamtí ( פוסט־מלחמתי ‎) 'post-war' pro-araví ( פרו־ערבי ‎) 'pro-Arab' Some hybrid words consist of both a non-Hebrew word and a non-Hebrew suffix of different origins: shababnik ( שבבניק ‎) 'rebel youth of Haredi Judaism ', from Arabic shabab (youth) and -nik of Yiddish and Russian descent Some hybrid words consist of a non-Hebrew word and a Hebrew suffix: Individuali-ut ( אינדיבידואליות ‎) 'Individualism', from English Individual and ut , a productive Hebrew suffix meaning -ism Modern Hebrew also has a productive derogatory prefixal shm- , which results in an 'echoic expressive'. For example, um shmum ( או״ם־שמו״ם ‎), literally 'United Nations shm-United Nations', was a pejorative description by Israel's first Prime Minister, David Ben-Gurion , of the United Nations , called in Modern Hebrew umot meukhadot ( אומות מאוחדות ‎) and abbreviated um ( או״ם ‎). Thus, when a Hebrew speaker would like to express their impatience with or disdain for philosophy, they can say filosófya- shm ilosófya ( פילוסופיה־שמילוסופיה ‎). Modern Hebrew shm- is traceable back to Yiddish , and is found in English as well as shm-reduplication . This is comparable to the Turkic initial m-segment conveying a sense of 'and so on' as in Turkish dergi mergi okumuyor , literally 'magazine "shmagazine" read:NEGATIVE:PRESENT:3rd.person.singular', i.e. '(He) doesn't read magazine, journals or anything like that'.

[ 15 ] Filipino [ edit ] In Filipino , hybrid words are called siyokoy (literally "merman"). For example, the word concernado ("concerned") has "concern-" come from English and "-ado" come from Spanish.

Japanese [ edit ] In Japanese , hybrid words are common in kango (words formed from kanji characters) in which some of the characters may be pronounced using Chinese pronunciations ( on'yomi, from Chinese morphemes), and others in the same word are pronounced using Japanese pronunciations ( kun'yomi, from Japanese morphemes). These words are known as jūbako (重箱) or yutō (湯桶), which are themselves examples of this kind of compound (they are autological words ): the first character of jūbako is read using on'yomi , the second kun'yomi , while it is the other way around with yutō . Other examples include 場所 basho "place" ( kun-on ), 金色 kin'iro "golden" ( on-kun ) and 合気道 aikidō "the martial art Aikido " ( kun-on-on ). Some hybrid words are neither jūbako nor yutō (縦中横 tatechūyoko ( kun-on-kun )). Foreign words may also be hybridized with Chinese or Japanese readings in slang words such as 高層ビル kōsōbiru "high-rise building" ( on-on-katakana ) and 飯テロ meshitero "food terrorism" ( kun-katakana ).
