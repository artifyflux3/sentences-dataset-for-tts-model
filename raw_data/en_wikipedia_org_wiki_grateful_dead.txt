The **Grateful Dead** was an American [rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music "Rock music") band formed in [Palo Alto, California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palo_Alto,_California "Palo Alto, California"), in 1965.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-musicbox-2) Known for their eclectic style that fused elements of rock, [blues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blues "Blues"), [jazz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz "Jazz"), [folk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_music "Folk music"), [country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music "Country music"), [bluegrass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluegrass_music "Bluegrass music"), [rock and roll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_and_roll "Rock and roll"), [gospel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_music "Gospel music"), [reggae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggae "Reggae"), and [world music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_music "World music") with [psychedelia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelic_music "Psychedelic music"),[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-4) the band is famous for [improvisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_improvisation "Musical improvisation") during their [live performances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concert "Concert"),[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-encyclobrit1-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-rockhallgd1-6) and for their devoted fan base, known as "[Deadheads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadhead "Deadhead")". According to the musician and writer [Lenny Kaye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenny_Kaye "Lenny Kaye"), the music of the Grateful Dead "touches on ground that most other groups don't even know exists."[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-livedeadrs1-7) For the range of their influences and the structure of their live performances, the Grateful Dead are considered "the pioneering godfathers of the [jam band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jam_band "Jam band") world".[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-8)

The Grateful Dead was founded in the [San Francisco Bay Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay_Area "San Francisco Bay Area") during the rise of the [counterculture of the 1960s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterculture_of_the_1960s "Counterculture of the 1960s").[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-9)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-Sylvan2002-10)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-11)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-12) The band's founding members were [Jerry Garcia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Garcia "Jerry Garcia") ([lead guitar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_guitar "Electric guitar") and vocals), [Bob Weir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Weir "Bob Weir") (rhythm guitar and vocals), [Ron "Pigpen" McKernan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_%22Pigpen%22_McKernan "Ron \"Pigpen\" McKernan") ([keyboards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_instrument "Keyboard instrument"), [harmonica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonica "Harmonica"), and vocals), [Phil Lesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Lesh "Phil Lesh") ([bass guitar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_guitar "Bass guitar") and vocals), and [Bill Kreutzmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Kreutzmann "Bill Kreutzmann") ([drums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_kit "Drum kit")).[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-13) Members of the Grateful Dead, originally known as **the Warlocks**, had played together in various Bay Area ensembles, including the traditional [jug band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jug_band "Jug band") Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions. Lesh was the last member to join the Warlocks before they changed their name to Grateful Dead, replacing Dana Morgan Jr., who had played bass for a few gigs. Drummer [Mickey Hart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey_Hart "Mickey Hart") and non-performing lyricist [Robert Hunter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Hunter_(lyricist) "Robert Hunter (lyricist)") joined in 1967. With the exception of McKernan, who died in 1973, and Hart, who left the band from 1971 to 1974, the core of the band stayed together for its entire 30-year history.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-14) Other official members of the band included [Tom Constanten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Constanten "Tom Constanten") (keyboards from 1968 to 1970), [John Perry Barlow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Perry_Barlow "John Perry Barlow") (non-performing lyricist from 1971 to 1995),[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-15)[Keith Godchaux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Godchaux "Keith Godchaux") (keyboards and occasional vocals from 1971 to 1979), [Donna Godchaux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Godchaux "Donna Godchaux") (vocals from 1972 to 1979), [Brent Mydland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brent_Mydland "Brent Mydland") (keyboards and vocals from 1979 to 1990), and [Vince Welnick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vince_Welnick "Vince Welnick") (keyboards and vocals from 1990 to 1995).[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-Dead.net-band-16)[Bruce Hornsby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Hornsby "Bruce Hornsby") (accordion, piano, vocals) was a [touring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concert_tour "Concert tour") member from 1990 to 1992, as well as a guest with the band on occasion before and after the tours.

After Garcia's death in 1995, former members of the band, along with other musicians, toured as [The Other Ones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Other_Ones "The Other Ones") in 1998, 2000, and 2002, and as [The Dead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dead_(band) "The Dead (band)") in 2003, 2004, and 2009. In 2015, the four surviving core members marked the band's 50th anniversary in a [series of concerts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fare_Thee_Well:_Celebrating_50_Years_of_the_Grateful_Dead "Fare Thee Well: Celebrating 50 Years of the Grateful Dead") in [Santa Clara, California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Clara,_California "Santa Clara, California"), and [Chicago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago "Chicago") that were billed as their last performances together.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-dead50-17) There have also been several spin-offs featuring one or more core members, such as [Dead & Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_%26_Company "Dead & Company"), [Furthur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furthur_(band) "Furthur (band)"), the [Rhythm Devils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythm_Devils "Rhythm Devils"), [Phil Lesh and Friends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Lesh_and_Friends "Phil Lesh and Friends"), [RatDog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RatDog "RatDog"), and [Billy & the Kids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_%26_the_Kids "Billy & the Kids").

Despite having only one Top-40 single in their 30-year career, "[Touch of Grey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_of_Grey "Touch of Grey")" (1987), the Grateful Dead remained among the highest-grossing American touring acts for decades. They gained a committed fanbase by word of mouth and through the free exchange of their live recordings, encouraged by the band's allowance of [taping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taper_(concert) "Taper (concert)"). In 2024, they broke the record for most Top-40 albums on the [_Billboard_ 200](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_200 "Billboard 200") chart.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-18)_[Rolling Stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling\_Stone "Rolling Stone")_ ranked the Grateful Dead number 57 on its 2011 list of the "[100 Greatest Artists of All Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone%27s_100_Greatest_Artists_of_All_Time "Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time")".[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-rollstone-19) The band was inducted into the [Rock and Roll Hall of Fame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame "Rock and Roll Hall of Fame") in 1994,[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-20) and a recording of their [May 8, 1977 performance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_5/8/77 "Cornell 5/8/77") at [Cornell University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_University "Cornell University")'s [Barton Hall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barton_Hall "Barton Hall") was added to the [National Recording Registry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Recording_Registry "National Recording Registry") of the [Library of Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Congress "Library of Congress") in 2012 for being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-21) In 2024, Weir, Lesh, Kreutzmann, and Hart were recognized as part of the [Kennedy Center Honors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy_Center_Honors "Kennedy Center Honors").[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-Grateful_Dead,_Francis_Ford_Coppola,_Bonnie_Raitt_on_2024_Kennedy_Center_Honors_list-22)

Not pictured: [Brent Mydland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brent_Mydland "Brent Mydland").

The Grateful Dead began their career as the Warlocks, a group formed in early 1965 from the remnants of a [Palo Alto, California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palo_Alto,_California "Palo Alto, California")[jug band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jug_band "Jug band") called [Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_McCree%27s_Uptown_Jug_Champions_(album) "Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions (album)") and members of The Wildwood Boys (Jerry Garcia, Ron "Pigpen" McKernan, David Nelson, Robert Hunter, and Norm Van Maastricht).[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-23) As The Wildwood Boys they played regularly at The Tangent, a folk music coffeehouse operated by Stanford Medical Center doctors Stuart "Stu" Goldstein and David "Dave" Shoenstadt on University Avenue in Palo Alto (1963).[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-24) As the Warlocks, the band's first show was at Magoo's Pizza Parlor, at 639 Santa Cruz Avenue in suburban [Menlo Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menlo_Park,_California "Menlo Park, California"), on May 5, 1965, now a cocktail bar. The band continued playing bar shows,[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-25) like Frenchy's Bikini-A-Go-Go[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-26)[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-27) in [Hayward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayward,_California "Hayward, California") and, importantly, five sets a night, five nights a week, for six weeks, at the _In Room_[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-28)[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-29) in [Belmont](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont,_California "Belmont, California") as the Warlocks,[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-30) but quickly changed the band's name after finding out that a different band known as the Warlocks had put out a record under that name. ([The Velvet Underground](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Velvet_Underground "The Velvet Underground") also had to change its name from the Warlocks.)[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-31)

The name "[Grateful Dead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_dead_(folklore) "Grateful dead (folklore)")" was chosen from a dictionary. According to Lesh, Garcia "picked up an old _[Britannica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A6dia\_Britannica "Encyclopædia Britannica") World Language Dictionary_ ... [and] ... In that silvery elf-voice he said to me, 'Hey, man, how about the Grateful Dead?'"[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-32) The definition there was "the soul of a dead person, or his angel, showing gratitude to someone who, as an act of charity, arranged their burial." According to Alan Trist, director of the Grateful Dead's music publisher company Ice Nine, Garcia found the name in the [Funk & Wagnalls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funk_%26_Wagnalls "Funk & Wagnalls")_Folklore Dictionary_, when his finger landed on that phrase while playing a game of [Fictionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictionary "Fictionary").[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-33) In the Garcia biography _Captain Trips_, author Sandy Troy states that the band was smoking the psychedelic [DMT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimethyltryptamine "Dimethyltryptamine") at the time.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-CT01-34) The motif of the "grateful dead" appears in folktales from a variety of cultures.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-Boggs,_Ralph_Steele_1932._p._113-35)

The first show under the name Grateful Dead was in [San Jose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Jose,_California "San Jose, California") on December 4, 1965, at one of [Ken Kesey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Kesey "Ken Kesey")'s [Acid Tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_Tests "Acid Tests").[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-36)[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-37)[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-38) Scholar Michael Kaler has written that the Dead's participation in the Acid Tests was crucial both to the development of their improvisational vocabulary and to their bonding as a band, with the group having set out to foster an intra-band musical telepathy.[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-39) Kaler has further pointed out that the Dead's pursuit of a new improvisatory rock language in 1965 chronologically coincided with that same goal's adoption by [Jefferson Airplane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_Airplane "Jefferson Airplane"), [Pink Floyd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Floyd "Pink Floyd") and [the Velvet Underground](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Velvet_Underground "The Velvet Underground").[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-40)

Earlier [demo tapes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demo_tape "Demo tape") have survived, but the first of over 2,000 concerts known to have been recorded by the band's fans was a show at the [Fillmore Auditorium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fillmore "The Fillmore") in San Francisco on January 8, 1966.[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-41) Later that month, the Grateful Dead played at the Trips Festival, a three-day [psychedelic rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelic_rock "Psychedelic rock") weekend party and event produced by [Ken Kesey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Kesey "Ken Kesey"), [Stewart Brand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Brand "Stewart Brand"), and [Ramon Sender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ram%C3%B3n_Sender_(composer) "Ramón Sender (composer)"), that, in conjunction with the [Merry Pranksters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merry_Pranksters "Merry Pranksters"), brought the nascent [hippie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippie "Hippie") movement together for the first time.[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-42)[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-43)

Other supporting personnel who joined early included [Rock Scully](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_Scully "Rock Scully"), who heard of the band from Kesey and signed on as manager after meeting them at the Big Beat Acid Test; [Stewart Brand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Brand "Stewart Brand"), "with his side show of taped music and slides of Indian life, a multimedia presentation" at the Big Beat and then, expanded, at the Trips Festival; and [Owsley Stanley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owsley_Stanley "Owsley Stanley"), the "Acid King" whose [LSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysergic_acid_diethylamide "Lysergic acid diethylamide") supplied the Acid Tests and who, in early 1966, became the band's financial backer, renting them a house on the fringes of [Watts, Los Angeles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watts,_Los_Angeles "Watts, Los Angeles"), and buying them sound equipment. "We were living solely off of Owsley's good graces at that time. ... [His] trip was he wanted to design equipment for us, and we were going to have to be in sort of a lab situation for him to do it", said Garcia.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-CT01-34)

The [Mantra-Rock Dance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantra-Rock_Dance "Mantra-Rock Dance") promotional poster, published in 1967, featuring Grateful Dead

One of the group's earliest major performances in 1967 was the [Mantra-Rock Dance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantra-Rock_Dance "Mantra-Rock Dance"), a musical event held on January 29, 1967, at the [Avalon Ballroom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avalon_Ballroom "Avalon Ballroom") by the San Francisco [Hare Krishna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Society_for_Krishna_Consciousness "International Society for Krishna Consciousness") temple. The Grateful Dead performed at the event along with the Hare Krishna founder [Bhaktivedanta Swami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhaktivedanta_Swami "Bhaktivedanta Swami"), poet [Allen Ginsberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Ginsberg "Allen Ginsberg"), bands [Moby Grape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moby_Grape "Moby Grape") and [Big Brother and the Holding Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Brother_and_the_Holding_Company "Big Brother and the Holding Company") with [Janis Joplin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janis_Joplin "Janis Joplin"), donating proceeds to the temple.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-44)[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-45) The band's first LP, _[The Grateful Dead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Grateful\_Dead\_(album) "The Grateful Dead (album)")_, was released on Warner Brothers in 1967.

On May 3, 1968, the band played a free concert at [Columbia University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University "Columbia University") during the [anti–Vietnam War student protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1968_Columbia_University_protests "1968 Columbia University protests") during which students occupied several campus buildings. In order to play, the band, equipment and all, had to be “smuggled” on campus in the back of a bread delivery truck. “We were already jamming away before the security and police could stop us.”[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-46)

Classically trained trumpeter [Phil Lesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Lesh "Phil Lesh") performed on [bass guitar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_guitar "Bass guitar"). [Bob Weir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Weir "Bob Weir"), the youngest original member of the group, played [rhythm guitar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythm_guitar "Rhythm guitar"). [Ron "Pigpen" McKernan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_%22Pigpen%22_McKernan "Ron \"Pigpen\" McKernan") played [keyboards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammond_organ "Hammond organ"), [percussion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percussion_instrument "Percussion instrument"), and [harmonica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonica "Harmonica") until shortly before [his death in 1973 at the age of 27](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/27_Club "27 Club"). Garcia, Weir, and McKernan shared the lead vocal duties more or less equally; Lesh sang only a few leads, but his tenor was a key part of the band's three-part vocal harmonies. [Bill Kreutzmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Kreutzmann "Bill Kreutzmann") played [drums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum "Drum"), and in September 1967 was joined by a second drummer, New York City native [Mickey Hart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey_Hart "Mickey Hart"), who also played a wide variety of other [percussion instruments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percussion_instrument "Percussion instrument").

1970 included tour dates in [New Orleans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans "New Orleans"), where the band performed at [The Warehouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Warehouse_(New_Orleans) "The Warehouse (New Orleans)") for two nights. On January 31, 1970, the local police raided their hotel on [Bourbon Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourbon_Street "Bourbon Street") and arrested and charged 19 people with possession of various drugs.[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-47) The second night's concert was performed as scheduled after bail was posted. Eventually, the charges were dismissed, except those against sound engineer [Owsley Stanley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owsley_Stanley "Owsley Stanley"), who was already facing charges in California for manufacturing LSD. This event was later memorialized in the lyrics of “[Truckin'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truckin%27 "Truckin'")", a single from _American Beauty_ that reached number 64 on the charts.

Hart took time off from the band in February 1971, after his father, an accountant, absconded with much of the band's money;[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-48) Kreutzmann was once again as the sole percussionist. Hart rejoined the Grateful Dead for good in October 1974. [Tom "TC" Constanten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Constanten "Tom Constanten") was added as a second keyboardist from 1968 to 1970, to help Pigpen keep up with an increasingly psychedelic sound, while Pigpen transitioned into playing various percussion instruments and vocals.

After Constanten's departure, Pigpen reclaimed his position as sole keyboardist. Less than two years later, in late 1971, Pigpen was joined by another keyboardist, [Keith Godchaux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Godchaux_(musician) "Keith Godchaux (musician)"), who played [grand piano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_piano "Grand piano") alongside Pigpen's [Hammond B-3 organ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammond_organ "Hammond organ"). In early 1972, Keith's wife, [Donna Jean Godchaux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Jean_Godchaux "Donna Jean Godchaux"), joined the Grateful Dead as a backing vocalist.

Following the Grateful Dead's "[Europe '72](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe_%2772 "Europe '72")" tour, Pigpen's health had deteriorated to the point that he could no longer tour with the band. His final concert appearance was June 17, 1972, at the [Hollywood Bowl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_Bowl "Hollywood Bowl"), in Los Angeles;[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-49)[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-50) he died on March 8, 1973, of complications from liver damage.[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-51)

### Godchaux era (1972–1979)

Grateful Dead at [Arrowhead Stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrowhead_Stadium "Arrowhead Stadium") in July 1978

Pigpen's death did not slow down the Grateful Dead. With the help of manager [Ron Rakow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Leon_Rakow "Ronald Leon Rakow"), the band soon formed its own record label, [Grateful Dead Records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead_Records "Grateful Dead Records").[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-vh1.com-52) Later that year, it released its next studio album, the jazz-influenced _[Wake of the Flood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake\_of\_the\_Flood "Wake of the Flood"),_ which became their biggest commercial success thus far.[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-53) Meanwhile, capitalizing on the album's success, the band soon went back to the studio, and in June 1974 released another album, _[From the Mars Hotel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From\_the\_Mars\_Hotel "From the Mars Hotel")_. Not long after, the Dead decided to take a hiatus from live [touring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concert_tour "Concert tour"). The band travelled to Europe for a string of shows in September 1974, before performing a series of five concerts at the [Winterland Ballroom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winterland_Ballroom "Winterland Ballroom") in San Francisco in October 1974, and delved into various other projects.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-54) The Winterland concerts were filmed, and Garcia compiled the footage into _[The Grateful Dead Movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Grateful\_Dead\_Movie "The Grateful Dead Movie")_, a feature-length concert film released in 1977.[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-55)

In September 1975, the Dead released their eighth studio album, _[Blues for Allah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blues\_for\_Allah "Blues for Allah")_. The band resumed touring in June 1976, playing multiple dates in small theaters, rather than the stadium shows that had become common, and had exhausted them, in 1974.[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-vh1.com-52) That same year, they signed with [Arista Records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arista_Records "Arista Records"), and the new contract produced _[Terrapin Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrapin\_Station "Terrapin Station")_ in July 1977. The band's tour in the spring of that year is held in high regard by its fans, and its [concert of May 8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_5/8/77 "Cornell 5/8/77") at [Cornell University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_University "Cornell University") is often considered one of the best performances of its career.[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-56)[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-57)[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-58) Their [September 1977 concert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick%27s_Picks_Volume_15 "Dick's Picks Volume 15") at [Raceway Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Bridge_Township_Raceway_Park "Old Bridge Township Raceway Park") in [Old Bridge Township, New Jersey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Bridge_Township,_New_Jersey "Old Bridge Township, New Jersey") was attended by 107,019 people and held the record for [largest-ticketed concert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most-attended_concerts "List of most-attended concerts") in the United States by a single act for 47 years.[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-59)

Keith and Donna Jean Godchaux left the band in February 1979, citing artistic differences.

### Mydland/Welnick era (1979–1995)

Following the Godchauxs' departure, [Brent Mydland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brent_Mydland "Brent Mydland") joined as keyboardist and vocalist and was considered "the perfect fit." The Godchauxs then formed the [Heart of Gold Band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_of_Gold_Band "Heart of Gold Band"), before Keith died in a car accident in July 1980. Mydland was the keyboardist for the Grateful Dead for 11 years until his death by narcotics overdose in July 1990,[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-60) becoming the third keyboardist to die.

Shortly after Mydland found his place in the early 1980s, Garcia's health began to decline. He became a frequent smoker of "Persian," a type of heroin, and he gained weight at a rapid pace. He lost his liveliness on stage, his voice was strained, and Deadheads worried for his health. After he began to curtail his opiate usage gradually in 1985, Garcia slipped into a [diabetic coma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_coma "Diabetic coma") for several days in July 1986, leading to the cancelation of all concerts in the fall of that year. Garcia recovered, the band released _[In the Dark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In\_the\_Dark\_(Grateful\_Dead\_album) "In the Dark (Grateful Dead album)")_ in July 1987, which became its best-selling studio album and produced its only top-40 single, "[Touch of Grey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_of_Grey "Touch of Grey")," Also, that year, the group [toured](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan_and_Grateful_Dead_Tour_1987 "Bob Dylan and Grateful Dead Tour 1987") with [Bob Dylan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan "Bob Dylan"), as heard on the album _[Dylan & the Dead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dylan\_%26\_the\_Dead "Dylan & the Dead")_.

Mydland died in July 1990 and [Vince Welnick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vince_Welnick "Vince Welnick"), former keyboardist for [the Tubes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tubes "The Tubes"), joined as a band member, while [Bruce Hornsby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Hornsby "Bruce Hornsby"), who had a successful career with his band the Range, joined temporarily as a bridge to help Welnick learn songs. Both performed on keyboards and vocals—Welnick until the band's end, and Hornsby mainly from 1990 to 1992.

Saxophonist [Branford Marsalis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branford_Marsalis "Branford Marsalis") played five concerts with the band between 1990 and 1994.[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-61)

The Grateful Dead performed its final concert on July 9, 1995, at [Soldier Field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier_Field "Soldier Field") in Chicago.[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-62)

[Jerry Garcia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Garcia "Jerry Garcia") died on August 9, 1995. A few months after Garcia's death, the remaining members of the Grateful Dead decided to disband.[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-63) Since that time, there have been a number of [reunions by the surviving members](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reunions_of_the_Grateful_Dead "Reunions of the Grateful Dead") involving various combinations of musicians. Additionally, the former members have also begun or continued individual projects.

In 1998, Bob Weir, Phil Lesh, and Mickey Hart, along with several other musicians, formed a band called [the Other Ones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Other_Ones "The Other Ones"), and performed a number of concerts that year, releasing a live album, _[The Strange Remain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Strange\_Remain "The Strange Remain")_, the following year. In 2000, the Other Ones toured again, this time with Kreutzmann but without Lesh. After taking another year off, the band toured again in 2002 with Lesh. That year, the Other Ones then included all four living former Grateful Dead members who had been in the band for most or all of its history. At different times the shifting lineup of the Other Ones also included guitarists [Mark Karan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Karan "Mark Karan"), [Steve Kimock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Kimock "Steve Kimock"), and [Jimmy Herring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Herring "Jimmy Herring"), keyboardists [Bruce Hornsby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Hornsby "Bruce Hornsby"), [Jeff Chimenti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Chimenti "Jeff Chimenti"), and [Rob Barraco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Barraco "Rob Barraco"), saxophonist [Dave Ellis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Ellis_(saxophonist) "Dave Ellis (saxophonist)"), drummer [John Molo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Molo "John Molo"), bassist [Alphonso Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphonso_Johnson "Alphonso Johnson"), and vocalist [Susan Tedeschi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Tedeschi "Susan Tedeschi").[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-64)

In 2003, the Other Ones, still including Weir, Lesh, Hart, and Kreutzmann, changed their name to [the Dead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dead_(band) "The Dead (band)").[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-65) The Dead toured the United States in 2003, 2004 and 2009. The band's lineups included Jimmy Herring and [Warren Haynes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Haynes "Warren Haynes") on guitar, Jeff Chimenti and Rob Barraco on keyboards, and [Joan Osborne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Osborne "Joan Osborne") on vocals.[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-66) In 2008, members of the Dead played two concerts, called "[Deadheads for Obama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadheads_for_Obama "Deadheads for Obama")" and "[Change Rocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadheads_for_Obama#Change_Rocks "Deadheads for Obama")".

Following the 2009 Dead tour, Lesh and Weir formed the band [Furthur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furthur_(band) "Furthur (band)"), which debuted in September 2009.[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-67) Joining Lesh and Weir in Furthur were Chimenti (keyboards), [John Kadlecik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kadlecik "John Kadlecik") (guitar), [Joe Russo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Russo_(musician) "Joe Russo (musician)") (drums), [Jay Lane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Lane "Jay Lane") (drums), [Sunshine Becker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunshine_Becker "Sunshine Becker") (vocals), and Zoe Ellis (vocals). Lane and Ellis left the band in 2010, and vocalist [Jeff Pehrson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Pehrson "Jeff Pehrson") joined later that year. Furthur disbanded in 2014.[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-68)

In 2010, Hart and Kreutzmann re-formed the [Rhythm Devils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythm_Devils "Rhythm Devils"), and played a summer concert tour.[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-69) In the fall of 2015, Hart, Kreutzmann and Weir teamed up with Chimenti, guitarist [John Mayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mayer "John Mayer"), and bassist [Oteil Burbridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oteil_Burbridge "Oteil Burbridge") to form a band called [Dead & Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_%26_Company "Dead & Company"). Mayer recounted that in 2011 he was listening to [Pandora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandora_Radio "Pandora Radio") and happened upon the Grateful Dead song "[Althea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_to_Heaven#Track_listing "Go to Heaven")", and that soon Grateful Dead music was all he would listen to.[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-deadtour-70) Dead & Company toured every year (except 2020), until announcing that their summer 2023 tour, which saw Kreutzmann replaced by Lane, would be their last.[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-71) However, they later clarified that it was only their last _tour_, and they continue to perform concerts.

Since 1995, the former members of the Grateful Dead have also pursued solo music careers. Both [Bob Weir & RatDog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Weir_%26_RatDog "Bob Weir & RatDog")[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-72)[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-73) and [Phil Lesh and Friends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Lesh_and_Friends "Phil Lesh and Friends")[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-74)[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-75) have performed many concerts and released several albums. Mickey Hart and Bill Kreutzmann have also each released a few albums. Hart has toured with his [world music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_music "World music") percussion ensemble Planet Drum[[76]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-76) as well as the Mickey Hart Band.[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-77) Kreutzmann has led several different bands, including [BK3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BK3 "BK3"),[[78]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-78)[7 Walkers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_Walkers "7 Walkers") (with [Papa Mali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papa_Mali "Papa Mali")),[[79]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-79) and [Billy & the Kids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_%26_the_Kids "Billy & the Kids").[[80]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-80) Donna Godchaux has returned to the music scene, with the [Donna Jean Godchaux Band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Jean_Godchaux_Band "Donna Jean Godchaux Band"),[[81]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-81) and [Tom Constanten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Constanten "Tom Constanten") also continues to write and perform music.[[82]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-82) All of these groups continue to play Grateful Dead music.

In October 2014, it was announced that [Martin Scorsese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Scorsese "Martin Scorsese") would produce a documentary film about the Grateful Dead, to be directed by [Amir Bar-Lev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amir_Bar-Lev "Amir Bar-Lev"). [David Lemieux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lemieux_(archivist) "David Lemieux (archivist)") supervised the musical selection, and Weir, Hart, Kreutzmann, and Lesh agreed to new interviews for the film.[[83]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-83) Bar-Lev's four-hour documentary, titled _[Long Strange Trip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long\_Strange\_Trip "Long Strange Trip")_, was released in 2017.[[84]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-Relix-Bar-Lev-84)[[85]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-RollingStone-85)

In 2015, Weir, Lesh, Kreutzmann, and Hart reunited for five concerts called "Fare Thee Well: Celebrating 50 Years of the Grateful Dead".[[89]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-Pareles-89) The shows were performed on June 27 and 28 at [Levi's Stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levi%27s_Stadium "Levi's Stadium") in [Santa Clara, California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Clara,_California "Santa Clara, California"), and on July 3, 4 and 5 at [Soldier Field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier_Field "Soldier Field") in [Chicago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago "Chicago").[[89]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-Pareles-89)[[90]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-90) The band stated that this would be the final time that Weir, Lesh, Hart, and Kreutzmann would perform together.[[91]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-91) They were joined by [Trey Anastasio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trey_Anastasio "Trey Anastasio") of [Phish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phish "Phish") on guitar, Jeff Chimenti on keyboards, and Bruce Hornsby on piano.[[92]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-92)[[93]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-93) Demand for tickets was very high.[[94]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-94)[[95]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-95) The concerts were simulcast via various media.[[96]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-96)[[97]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-97) The Chicago shows have been released as a box set of CDs and DVDs.[[98]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-98)

Left to right: Garcia, Lesh, Kreutzmann, Weir, Hart, Mydland.

The Grateful Dead formed during the era when bands such as [the Beatles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles "The Beatles"), [the Beach Boys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beach_Boys "The Beach Boys") and [the Rolling Stones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rolling_Stones "The Rolling Stones") were dominating the airwaves. "The Beatles were why we turned from a jug band into a rock 'n' roll band", said Bob Weir. "What we saw them doing was impossibly attractive. I couldn't think of anything else more worth doing."[[99]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-Jackson2000-p.67-99) Former folk-scene star [Bob Dylan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan "Bob Dylan") had recently put out a couple of records featuring electric instrumentation. Grateful Dead members have said that it was after attending a concert by the touring New York City band [the Lovin' Spoonful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lovin%27_Spoonful "The Lovin' Spoonful") that they decided to "go electric" and look for a "dirtier" sound. [Jerry Garcia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Garcia "Jerry Garcia") and [Bob Weir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Weir "Bob Weir") (both of whom had been immersed in the [American folk music revival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_folk_music_revival "American folk music revival") of the late 1950s and early 1960s), were open-minded about the use of electric guitars.

The Grateful Dead's early music (in the mid-1960s) was part of the process of establishing what "[psychedelic music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelic_music "Psychedelic music")" was, but theirs was essentially a "street party" form of it. They developed their "psychedelic" playing as a result of meeting [Ken Kesey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Kesey "Ken Kesey") in [Palo Alto, California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palo_Alto,_California "Palo Alto, California"), and subsequently becoming the house band for the [Acid Tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_Tests "Acid Tests") he staged.[[100]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-100) They did not fit their music to an established category such as pop rock, blues, folk rock, or country & western. Individual tunes within their repertoire could be identified under one of these stylistic labels, but overall their music drew on all of these genres and, more frequently, melded several of them. [Bill Graham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Graham_(promoter) "Bill Graham (promoter)") said of the Grateful Dead, "They're not the best at what they do, they're the only ones that do what they do."[[101]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-101) Academics Paul Hegarty and Martin Halliwell argued that the Grateful Dead were "not merely as [precursors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-prog "Proto-prog") of [prog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_rock "Progressive rock") but as essential developments of progressiveness in its early days".[[102]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-Hegarty-102) Often (both in performance and on recording) the Dead left room for exploratory, spacey soundscapes.

Their live shows, fed by an improvisational approach to music, were different from most touring bands. While rock and roll bands often rehearse a standard set, played with minor variations, the Grateful Dead did not prepare in this way. Garcia stated in a 1966 interview, "We don't make up our sets beforehand. We'd rather work off the tops of our heads than off a piece of paper."[[103]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-The_Grateful_Dead_p._17-103) They maintained this approach throughout their career. For each performance, the band drew material from an active list of a hundred or so songs.[[103]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-The_Grateful_Dead_p._17-103)

The 1969 live album _[Live/Dead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live/Dead "Live/Dead")_ did capture the band in-form, but commercial success did not come until _[Workingman's Dead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workingman%27s\_Dead "Workingman's Dead")_ and _[American Beauty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American\_Beauty\_(album) "American Beauty (album)")_, both released in 1970. These records largely featured the band's laid-back [acoustic musicianship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_music "Acoustic music") and more traditional song structures. With their rootsy, eclectic stylings, particularly evident on the latter two albums, the band pioneered the hybrid [Americana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americana_music "Americana music") genre.[[104]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-billboard-amer-104)[[105]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-guardian-mcgee-105)[[106]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-no-depr-106)

### Instrumentation and musicianship

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Grateful_Dead&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Instrumentation and musicianship")]

As the band and its sound matured over thirty years of touring, playing, and recording, each member's stylistic contribution became more defined, consistent, and identifiable. Garcia's lead lines were fluid, supple and spare, owing a great deal of their character to his experience playing [Scruggs style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scruggs_style "Scruggs style") banjo, an approach which often makes use of [note syncopation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncopation "Syncopation"), [accenting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accent_(music) "Accent (music)"), [arpeggios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arpeggio "Arpeggio"), [staccato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staccato "Staccato")[chromatic runs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_fourth "Chromatic fourth"), and the anticipation of the [downbeat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downbeat_and_upbeat "Downbeat and upbeat").[[107]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-107)

Garcia had a distinctive sense of [timing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempo "Tempo"), often weaving in and out of the [groove](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groove_(music) "Groove (music)") established by the rest of the band as if he were pushing the beat. His lead lines were also immensely influenced by [jazz soloists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solo_(music) "Solo (music)"): Garcia cited [Miles Davis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Davis "Miles Davis"), [Ornette Coleman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornette_Coleman "Ornette Coleman"), [Bill Evans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Evans "Bill Evans"), [Pat Martino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Martino "Pat Martino"), [George Benson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Benson "George Benson"), [Al Di Meola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Di_Meola "Al Di Meola"), [Art Tatum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Tatum "Art Tatum"), [Duke Ellington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Ellington "Duke Ellington"), and [Django Reinhardt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Django_Reinhardt "Django Reinhardt") as primary influences, and frequently utilized techniques common to [country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music "Country music") and [blues music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blues_music "Blues music") in songs that called back to those traditions.[[108]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-108)

Garcia often switched [scales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(music) "Scale (music)") in the midst of a solo depending upon the [chord changes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_changes "Chord changes") played underneath, though he nearly always finished [phrases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_phrasing "Musical phrasing") by landing on the [chord-tones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_(chord) "Factor (chord)"). Jerry most frequently played in the [Mixolydian mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixolydian_mode "Mixolydian mode"), though his solos and phrases often incorporated notes from the [Dorian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorian_mode "Dorian mode") and [major/minor pentatonic scales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentatonic_scale "Pentatonic scale"). Particularly in the late 1960s, Garcia occasionally incorporated [melodic lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melody "Melody") derived from [Indian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_classical_music "Indian classical music")[ragas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragas "Ragas") into the band's extended, [psychedelic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelic_music "Psychedelic music")[improvisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_improvisation "Musical improvisation"), likely inspired by [John Coltrane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Coltrane "John Coltrane") and other jazz artists' interest in the [sitar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitar "Sitar") music of [Ravi Shankar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravi_Shankar "Ravi Shankar").[[109]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-109)

Lesh was originally a classically trained trumpet player with an extensive background in [music theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_theory "Music theory"), but did not tend to play traditional blues-based bass forms. He often played more melodic, symphonic and complex lines, often sounding like a second lead guitar. In contrast to most bassists in [popular music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_music "Popular music"), Lesh often avoids playing the [root](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_(chord) "Root (chord)") of a chord on the downbeat, instead withholding as a means to build [tension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tension_(music) "Tension (music)"). Lesh also rarely repeats the same bassline, even from performance to performance of the same song, and often plays off of or around the other instruments with a [syncopated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncopation "Syncopation"), [staccato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staccato "Staccato") bounce that contributes to the Dead's unique rhythmic character.[[110]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-110)

Weir, too, was not a traditional [rhythm guitarist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythm_guitar "Rhythm guitar"), but tended to play unique [inversions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_inversion "Chord inversion") at the upper end of the Dead's sound. Weir modeled his style of playing after jazz pianist [McCoy Tyner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCoy_Tyner "McCoy Tyner") and attempted to replicate the interplay between John Coltrane and Tyner in his support, and occasional subversion, of the [harmonic structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_structure "Harmonic structure") of Garcia's voice leadings. This would often influence the direction the band's improvisation would take on a given night. Weir and Garcia's respective positions as rhythm and lead guitarist were not always strictly adhered to, as Weir would often incorporate short melodic phrases into his playing to support Garcia and occasionally took solos, often played with a [slide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slide_guitar "Slide guitar"). Weir's playing is characterized by a "spiky, staccato" sound.[[111]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-111)[[112]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-112)[[113]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-113)

The band's two drummers, [Mickey Hart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey_Hart "Mickey Hart") and [Bill Kreutzmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Kreutzmann "Bill Kreutzmann"), developed a unique, complex interplay, balancing Kreutzmann's steady [shuffle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuffle_(music) "Shuffle (music)") beat with Hart's interest in percussion styles outside the rock tradition. Kreuzmann has said, "I like to establish a feeling and then add radical or oblique juxtapositions to that feeling."[[114]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-114) Hart incorporated an 11-count measure to his drumming, bringing a dimension to the band's sound that became an important part of its style. He had studied [tabla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabla "Tabla") drumming and incorporated rhythms and instruments from [world music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_music "World music"), and later [electronic music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_music "Electronic music"), into the band's live performances.

The Dead's live performances featured multiple types of [improvisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_improvisation "Musical improvisation") derived from a vast array of musical traditions. Not unlike many rock bands of their time, the majority of the Dead's songs feature a designated section in which an [instrumental break](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Break_(music) "Break (music)") occurs over the [chord changes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_changes "Chord changes"). These sections typically feature solos by Garcia that often originate as variations on the song's [melody](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melody "Melody"), but go on to create dynamic phrases that resolve by returning to the chord-tones. Not unlike traditional [improvisational jazz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz "Jazz"), they may occasionally feature several solos by multiple instruments within an undecided number of [bars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_(music) "Bar (music)"), such as a keyboardist, before returning to the melody. At the same time, Dead shows almost always feature a more collective, [modal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_jazz "Modal jazz") approach to improvisation that typically occurs during [segues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segue "Segue") between songs before the band [modulates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulation_(music) "Modulation (music)") to a new [tonal center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonal_center "Tonal center"). Some of the Dead's more extended jam vehicles, such as "[The Other One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/That%27s_It_for_the_Other_One "That's It for the Other One")", "[Dark Star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Star_(song) "Dark Star (song)")", and "[Playing in the Band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playing_in_the_Band "Playing in the Band")" almost exclusively make use of modulation between modes to accompany simple two-chord progressions.[[115]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-115)

Following the songwriting renaissance that defined the band's early 1970s period, as reflected in the albums _[Workingman's Dead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workingman%27s\_Dead "Workingman's Dead")_ and _[American Beauty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American\_Beauty\_(album) "American Beauty (album)"),_[Robert Hunter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Hunter_(lyricist) "Robert Hunter (lyricist)"), Jerry Garcia's primary lyrical partner, frequently made use of [motifs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motif_(narrative) "Motif (narrative)") common to [American folklore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_folklore "American folklore") including trains, guns, elements, [traditional musical instruments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_instrument "Folk instrument"), gambling, murder, animals, alcohol, descriptions of [American geography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography_of_the_United_States "Geography of the United States"), and [religious symbolism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_symbolism "Religious symbolism") to illustrate themes involving love and loss, life and death, beauty and horror, and chaos and order.[[116]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-116) Following in the footsteps of several [American musical traditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_of_the_United_States "Music of the United States"), these songs are often confessional and feature narration from the perspective of an [antihero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antihero "Antihero"). Critic [Robert Christgau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Christgau "Robert Christgau") described them as "American myths" that later gave way to "the old karma-go-round".[[117]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-CG-myth-117)

An extremely common feature in both Robert Hunter's lyrics, as well as the band's visual iconography, is the presence of [dualistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dualism_in_cosmology "Dualism in cosmology") and opposing imagery illustrating the dynamic range of the [human experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_condition "Human condition") (Heaven and hell, law and crime, dark and light, etc.). Hunter and Garcia's earlier, more directly [psychedelic-influenced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelia "Psychedelia") compositions often make use of [surreal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrealism "Surrealism") imagery, [nonsense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonsense_verse "Nonsense verse"), and whimsey reflective of traditions in [English poetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_poetry "English poetry").[[118]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-118) In a retrospective, _[The New Yorker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_New\_Yorker "The New Yorker")_ described Hunter's verses as "elliptical, by turns vivid and [gnomic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnomic_poetry "Gnomic poetry")", which were often "hippie poetry about roses and bells and dew".[[119]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-119) Grateful Dead biographer Dennis McNally has described Hunter's lyrics as creating "a non-literal hyper-Americana" weaving a psychedelic, kaleidoscopic tapestry in the hopes of elucidating America's [national character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_the_United_States "Culture of the United States"). At least one of Hunter and Bob Weir's collaborations, "[Jack Straw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Straw_(song) "Jack Straw (song)")", was inspired by the work of [John Steinbeck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Steinbeck "John Steinbeck").[[120]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-120)

Influence and legacy
--------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Grateful_Dead&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Influence and legacy")]

Grateful Dead have been called a "symbol of the [counterculture movement of the sixties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1960s_counterculture "1960s counterculture")". Beginning in the early 1990s, a new generation of bands became inspired by the Grateful Dead's improvisational ethos and [marketing strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing_strategy "Marketing strategy"), and began to incorporate elements of the Grateful Dead's live performances into their own shows. These include the nightly alteration of [setlists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_list "Set list"), frequent improvisation, [the blending of genres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_(music) "Fusion (music)"), and the allowance of [taping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taper_(concert) "Taper (concert)"), which would often contribute to the development of a dedicated fanbase. Bands associated with the expansion of the ["jam scene"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jam_band "Jam band") include [Phish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phish "Phish"), [The String Cheese Incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_String_Cheese_Incident "The String Cheese Incident"), [Widespread Panic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widespread_Panic "Widespread Panic"), [Blues Traveler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blues_Traveler "Blues Traveler"), [moe.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moe_(band) "Moe (band)"), and the [Disco Biscuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disco_Biscuits "Disco Biscuits"). Many of these groups began to look past the [American roots music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roots_rock "Roots rock") that the Grateful Dead drew inspiration from, and incorporated elements of [progressive rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_rock "Progressive rock"), [hard rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_rock "Hard rock"), and [electronica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronica "Electronica"). At the same time, the Internet gained popularity and provided a medium for fans to discuss these bands and their performances and download [MP3s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP3 "MP3"). The Grateful Dead, as well as Phish, were one of the first bands to have a [Usenet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet "Usenet") newsgroup.[[121]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-121)[[122]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-122)[[123]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-123)[[124]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-124)

Merchandising and representation

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Grateful_Dead&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Merchandising and representation")]

[Hal Kant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hal_Kant "Hal Kant") was an entertainment industry attorney who specialized in representing musical groups. He spent 35 years as principal lawyer and general counsel for the Grateful Dead, a position in the group that was so strong that his business cards with the band identified his role as "Czar".[[125]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-THR-125)

Kant brought the band millions of dollars in revenue through his management of the band's [intellectual property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property "Intellectual property") and merchandising rights. At Kant's recommendation, the group was one of the few rock 'n roll pioneers to retain ownership of their music masters and [publishing rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publishing_rights "Publishing rights").

In 2006, the Grateful Dead signed a ten-year licensing agreement with [Rhino Entertainment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhino_Entertainment "Rhino Entertainment") to manage the band's business interests including the release of musical recordings, merchandising, and marketing. The band retained creative control and kept ownership of its music catalog.[[126]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-126)[[127]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-127)

A Grateful Dead video game titled _Grateful Dead Game– The Epic Tour_[[128]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-128) was released in April 2012 and was created by Curious Sense.[[129]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-129)

In November 2022, the children's book _The ABCs of The Grateful Dead_ was released.[[130]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-130) Authorized by the group, it was written by Howie Abrams, illustrated by [Michael "Kaves" McLeer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaves "Kaves"), and published by [Simon & Schuster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_%26_Schuster "Simon & Schuster").[[131]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-131)

The "Skully" tie-dyed T-shirt, designed by [New York City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City "New York City") artist Greg Speirs, became a symbol of [Lithuanian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuania "Lithuania") basketball.

After [Lithuania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuania "Lithuania")[gained its independence from the USSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act_of_the_Re-Establishment_of_the_State_of_Lithuania "Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania"), the country announced its withdrawal from the [1992 Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_Summer_Olympics "1992 Summer Olympics") due to the lack of any money to sponsor participants.[[132]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-:0-132) But NBA star [Šarūnas Marčiulionis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%A0ar%C5%ABnas_Mar%C4%8Diulionis "Šarūnas Marčiulionis"), a native Lithuanian basketball star, wanted to help his native team to compete. His efforts resulted in a call from representatives of the Grateful Dead who set up a meeting with the band members.[[133]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-133) The band agreed to fund transportation costs for the team (about $5,000) along with Grateful Dead designs for the team's jerseys and shorts. The [Lithuanian basketball team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuania_men%27s_national_basketball_team "Lithuania men's national basketball team") won the bronze medal and the Lithuanian basketball/Grateful Dead T-shirts became part of pop culture, especially in Lithuania.[[132]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-:0-132)[[134]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-134) The incident was covered by the documentary _[The Other Dream Team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Other\_Dream\_Team "The Other Dream Team")_.[[135]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-135)

The Grateful Dead toured constantly throughout their career, playing more than 2,300 concerts.[[136]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-136) They promoted a sense of community among their fans, who became known as "[Deadheads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadhead "Deadhead")", many of whom followed their tours for months or years on end. Around concert venues, an impromptu communal marketplace known as '[Shakedown Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakedown_Street_(vending_area) "Shakedown Street (vending area)")' was created by Deadheads to serve as centers of activity where fans could buy and sell anything from grilled cheese sandwiches to home-made t-shirts and recordings of Grateful Dead concerts.[[137]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-137)

In their early career, the band also dedicated their time and talents to their community, the Haight-Ashbury area of San Francisco, making available free food, lodging, music, and health care to all. It has been said that the band performed "more free concerts than any band in the history of music".[[138]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-138)

With the exception of 1975, when the band was on hiatus and played only four concerts, Grateful Dead performed many concerts every year, from their formation in April 1965, until July 9, 1995.[[139]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-139) Initially all their shows were in California, principally in the [San Francisco Bay Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay_Area "San Francisco Bay Area") and in or near [Los Angeles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles "Los Angeles"). They also performed, in 1965 and 1966, with [Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merry_Pranksters "Merry Pranksters"), as the house band for the [Acid Tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_Tests "Acid Tests").

In 1967, they toured nationally, including their first performance in [New York City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City "New York City"). They appeared at the [Monterey Pop Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monterey_Pop_Festival "Monterey Pop Festival") in 1967, the [Woodstock Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodstock_Festival "Woodstock Festival") in 1969 and the [Festival Express](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Festival_Express "Festival Express") train tour across Canada in 1970. They were scheduled to appear as the final act at the infamous [Altamont Free Concert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altamont_Free_Concert "Altamont Free Concert") on December 6, 1969, after the [Rolling Stones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stones "Rolling Stones") but withdrew after security concerns. "That's the way things went at Altamont—so badly that the Grateful Dead, prime organizers and movers of the festival, didn't even get to play", staff at _[Rolling Stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling\_Stone "Rolling Stone")_ magazine wrote in a detailed narrative on the event.[[140]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-rrwd-140)

Their first UK performance was at the [Hollywood Music Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_music_festival "Hollywood music festival") in 1970. Their largest concert audience came in 1973 when they played, along with [the Allman Brothers Band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Allman_Brothers_Band "The Allman Brothers Band") and [the Band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Band "The Band"), before an estimated 600,000 people at the [Summer Jam at Watkins Glen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Jam_at_Watkins_Glen "Summer Jam at Watkins Glen").[[141]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-141) They played to an estimated total of 25 million people, more than any other band, with audiences of up to 80,000 attending a single show. Many of these concerts were preserved in the band's tape vault, and several dozen have since been released on CD and as downloads. The Dead were known for the tremendous variation in their setlists from night to night—the list of songs documented to have been played by the band exceeds 500.[[142]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-142) The band has released four concert videos under the name _[View from the Vault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/View\_from\_the\_Vault "View from the Vault")_. In 1978, they played three nights at the [Great Pyramid of Giza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Pyramid_of_Giza "Great Pyramid of Giza") in [Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt "Egypt").

In the 1990s, the Grateful Dead earned a total of $285 million in revenue from their concert tours, the second-highest during the 1990s, with the Rolling Stones earning the most.[[143]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-Waddell-143) This figure is representative of tour revenue through 1995, as touring stopped after the death of Jerry Garcia.[[143]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-Waddell-143)

In a 1991 [PBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBS "PBS") documentary, segment host Buck Henry attended an August 1991 concert at Shoreline Amphitheatre and gleaned some information from some band members about the Grateful Dead phenomenon and its success.[[144]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-Henry_1991-144) At the time, Jerry Garcia stated, "We didn't really invent the Grateful Dead, the crowd invented the Grateful Dead, you know what I mean? We were sort of standing in line, and uh, it's gone way past our expectations, way past, so it's, we've been going along with it to see what it's gonna do next."[[144]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-Henry_1991-144) Mickey Hart said, "This is one of the last places in America that you can really have this kind of fun, you know, considering the political climate and so forth."[[144]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-Henry_1991-144) Hart also stated that "the transformative power of the Grateful Dead is really the essence of it; it's what it can do to your consciousness. We're more into _transportation_ than we are into music, _per se_, I mean, the business of the Grateful Dead is transportation."[[144]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-Henry_1991-144) One of the band's largest concerts took place just months before Garcia's death — at their outdoor show with Bob Dylan in [Highgate, Vermont](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highgate,_Vermont "Highgate, Vermont"), on June 15, 1995. The crowd was estimated to be over 90,000; overnight camping was allowed and about a third of the audience got in without having purchased a ticket.[[145]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-145)[[146]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-146)[[147]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-147)

Their numerous studio albums were generally collections of new songs that they had first played in concert. The band was also famous for its extended musical improvisations, having been described as having never played the same song the same way twice. Their concert sets often blended songs, one into the next, often for more than three songs at a time.

### Concert sound systems

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Grateful_Dead&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Concert sound systems")]

The [Wall of Sound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_of_Sound_(Grateful_Dead) "Wall of Sound (Grateful Dead)") was a large sound system designed specifically for the band.[[148]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-148)[[149]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-149) The band was never satisfied with the house system anywhere they played. After the Monterey Pop Festival, the band's crew 'borrowed' some of the other performers' sound equipment and used it to host some free shows in San Francisco.[[150]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-150) In their early days, soundman [Owsley "Bear" Stanley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owsley_Stanley "Owsley Stanley") designed a [public address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_address "Public address") (PA) and monitor system for them. Stanley was the Grateful Dead's soundman for many years; he was also one of the largest suppliers of [LSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysergic_acid_diethylamide "Lysergic acid diethylamide").[[151]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-151)

Stanley's sound systems were delicate and finicky, and frequently brought shows to a halt with technical breakdowns. After Stanley went to jail for manufacturing LSD in 1970, the group briefly used house PAs, but found them to be even less reliable than those built by their former soundman. On February 2, 1970, the group contacted [Bob Heil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Heil "Bob Heil") to use his system.[[152]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-performing-152) In 1971, the band purchased their first [solid-state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_state_(electronics) "Solid state (electronics)") sound system from [Alembic Studios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_High_Recording "Pacific High Recording"). Because of this, [Alembic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alembic_Inc "Alembic Inc") would play an integral role in the research, development, and production of the Wall of Sound. The band also welcomed [Dan Healy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Healy_(soundman) "Dan Healy (soundman)") into the fold on a permanent basis that year. Healy would mix the Grateful Dead's live sound until 1993.

Following Jerry Garcia's death and the band's breakup in 1995, their current sound system was inherited by [Dave Matthews Band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Matthews_Band "Dave Matthews Band"). Dave Matthews Band debuted the sound system April 30, 1996, at the first show of their 1996 tour in Richmond, Virginia.

Like several other bands at the time, the Grateful Dead allowed their fans to record their shows. For many years the [tapers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taper_(concert) "Taper (concert)") set up their microphones wherever they could, and the eventual forest of microphones became a problem for the sound crew. Eventually, this was solved by having a dedicated taping section located behind the soundboard, which required a special "tapers" ticket. The band allowed sharing of their shows, as long as no profits were made on the sale of the tapes.[[153]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-153)

Of the approximately 2,350 shows the Grateful Dead played, almost 2,200 were taped, and most of these are available online.[[154]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-154) The band began collecting and cataloging tapes early on and [Dick Latvala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Latvala "Dick Latvala") was their keeper. "[Dick's Picks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick%27s_Picks "Dick's Picks")" is named after Latvala. After his death in 1999, [David Lemieux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lemieux_(archivist) "David Lemieux (archivist)") gradually took the post. Concert set lists from a subset of 1,590 Grateful Dead shows were used to perform a comparative analysis between how songs were played in concert and how they are listened online by [Last.fm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last.fm "Last.fm") members.[[155]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-155) In their book _Marketing Lessons from the Grateful Dead: What Every Business Can Learn From the Most Iconic Band in History_,[[156]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-156)[David Meerman Scott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Meerman_Scott "David Meerman Scott") and [Brian Halligan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Halligan "Brian Halligan") identify the taper section as a crucial contributor to increasing the Grateful Dead's fan base.

Over the years, a number of iconic images have come to be associated with the Grateful Dead. Many of these images originated as artwork for concert posters or album covers.

Skull and Roses The skull and roses design was composed by [Alton Kelley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alton_Kelley "Alton Kelley") and [Stanley Mouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Mouse "Stanley Mouse"), who added lettering and color, respectively, to a black and white drawing by [Edmund Joseph Sullivan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Joseph_Sullivan "Edmund Joseph Sullivan"). Sullivan's drawing was an illustration for a 1913 edition of the _[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubaiyat\_of\_Omar\_Khayyam "Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam")_. Earlier antecedents include the custom of exhibiting the relic skulls of Christian martyrs decorated with roses on their feast days. The rose is an attribute of [Saint Valentine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Valentine "Saint Valentine"), who according to one legend, was martyred by decapitation. Accordingly, in Rome, at the church dedicated to him, the observance of his feast day included the display of his skull surrounded by roses.[[157]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-157) Kelley and Mouse's design originally appeared on a poster for the September 16 and 17, 1966, Dead shows at the [Avalon Ballroom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avalon_Ballroom "Avalon Ballroom").[[158]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-158) Later, it was used as the cover for the album _[Grateful Dead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful\_Dead\_(album) "Grateful Dead (album)")_ (1971). The album is sometimes referred to as _Skull and Roses_.[[159]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-159)Jester Another icon of the Dead is a skeleton dressed as a [jester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jester "Jester") and holding a [lute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lute "Lute"). This image was an airbrush painting, created by Stanley Mouse in 1972. It was originally used for the cover of _The Grateful Dead Songbook_.[[160]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-160)[[161]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-161)"Dancing" Bears A series of stylized bears who appear to be dancing was drawn by Bob Thomas as part of the back cover for the album _[History of the Grateful Dead, Volume One (Bear's Choice)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History\_of\_the\_Grateful\_Dead,\_Volume\_One\_(Bear%27s\_Choice) "History of the Grateful Dead, Volume One (Bear's Choice)")_ (1973). Thomas reported that he based the bears on a lead [sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sort_(typesetting) "Sort (typesetting)") from an unknown [font](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Font "Font").[[162]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-162) The bear is a reference to [Owsley "Bear" Stanley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owsley_Stanley "Owsley Stanley"), who recorded and produced the album. Bear himself wrote, "the bears on the album cover are not really 'dancing'. I don't know why people think they are; their positions are quite obviously those of a high-stepping march."[[163]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-bearstory-163)_Steal Your Face_ Skull Perhaps the best-known Grateful Dead art icon is a red, white, and blue skull with a lightning bolt through it. The lightning bolt skull can be found on the cover of the album _[Steal Your Face](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal\_Your\_Face "Steal Your Face")_ (1976), and the image is sometimes known by that name. It was designed by [Owsley Stanley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owsley_Stanley "Owsley Stanley") and artist Bob Thomas, and was originally used as a logo to mark the band's equipment.[[164]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-164)Dancing Terrapins The two dancing [terrapins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrapin "Terrapin") first appeared on the cover of the album _[Terrapin Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrapin\_Station "Terrapin Station")_ (1977). They were drawn by Kelley and Mouse, based on a drawing by [Heinrich Kley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Kley "Heinrich Kley"). Since then these turtles have become one of the Grateful Dead's most recognizable logos.[[165]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-165)Uncle Sam Skeleton The Uncle Sam skeleton was devised by Gary Gutierrez as part of the animation for _[The Grateful Dead Movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Grateful\_Dead\_Movie "The Grateful Dead Movie")_ (1977).[[166]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-166) The image combines the Grateful Dead skeleton motif with the character of [Uncle Sam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncle_Sam "Uncle Sam"), a reference to the then-recently written song "U.S. Blues", which plays during the animation.
Fans and enthusiasts of the band are commonly referred to as [Deadheads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadhead "Deadhead"). While the origin of the term may be unclear, _Dead Heads_ were made canon by the notice placed inside the _[Skull and Roses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful\_Dead\_(album) "Grateful Dead (album)")_ (1971) album by manager Jon McIntire:

> DEAD FREAKS UNITE: Who are you? Where are you? How are you?
> 
> Send us your name and address and we'll keep you informed.
> 
> Dead Heads, P.O. Box 1065, San Rafael, California 94901.

As each show featured a new setlist and a great deal of improvisation, Deadheads would often follow the band from city to city, attending many shows on a given tour. Many Deadheads speak of being drawn to the culture due to the sense of community that the band's shows tended to foster. Though Deadheads came from a wide array of demographics, many attempted to reproduce the aesthetics and values of the [1960s counterculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterculture_of_the_1960s "Counterculture of the 1960s") and were often stigmatized in the media.[[167]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-167) Because of the stereotyping of Deadheads as [hippies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippie "Hippie"), the band's shows became a common target for officials in the [DEA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_Enforcement_Administration "Drug Enforcement Administration") and arrests at shows became common.[[168]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-168)

As a group, the Deadheads were considered very mellow. "I'd rather work nine Grateful Dead concerts than one Oregon football game," Police Det. Rick Raynor said. "They don't get belligerent like they do at the games."[[169]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-169) Despite this reputation, in the mid-1990s, as the band's popularity grew, there were a series of minor scuffles occurring at shows that peaked with a large scale riot at the [Deer Creek Music Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deer_Creek_Music_Center "Deer Creek Music Center") near Indianapolis in July 1995. This [gate crashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gate_crashing "Gate crashing") incident caused the band to cancel the following night's show.[[170]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-170) Deadheads who appeared on the scene after the band's 1987 hit single "[Touch of Grey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_of_Grey "Touch of Grey")", were often disparagingly referred to by older fans as "Touchheads". Beginning in the 1980s, a number of definable sects of Deadheads began to appear on the scene. These included the [Wharf Rats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wharf_Rats "Wharf Rats"), as well as the "spinners", named for [whirling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sufi_whirling "Sufi whirling")-style of dancing and their use of the band's music to facilitate [mystical experiences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystical_experience "Mystical experience").[[171]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-171)

Deadheads, particularly those who collected [tapes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taper_(concert) "Taper (concert)"), were known for keeping close records of the band's setlists and for comparing various live versions of the band's songs, as reflected in publications such as the various editions of "Deadbase" and "The Deadhead's Taping Compendium". This practice continues into the 21st century on digital forums and websites such as the [Internet Archive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Archive#Grateful_Dead "Internet Archive"), which features live recordings of nearly every available Grateful Dead show and allows users to discuss and review the site's shows.

The band has [a number of influential and celebrity fans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadhead#Celebrities "Deadhead"), including politicians, businesspeople, journalists, and other musicians.

Donation of archives to UC Santa Cruz
-------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Grateful_Dead&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: Donation of archives to UC Santa Cruz")]

On April 24, 2008, members Bob Weir and Mickey Hart, along with Nion McEvoy, CEO of [Chronicle Books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronicle_Books "Chronicle Books"), [UC Santa Cruz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Santa_Cruz "University of California, Santa Cruz") chancellor [George R. Blumenthal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_R._Blumenthal "George R. Blumenthal"), and UC Santa Cruz librarian Virginia Steel, held a press conference announcing UCSC's McHenry Library would be the permanent home of the [Grateful Dead Archive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead_Archive "Grateful Dead Archive"), which includes a complete archival history from 1965 to the present. The archive includes correspondence, photographs, fliers, posters, and several other forms of memorabilia and records of the band. Also included are unreleased videos of interviews and TV appearances that will be installed for visitors to view, as well as stage backdrops and other props from the band's concerts.

Blumenthal stated at the event, "The Grateful Dead Archive represents one of the most significant popular cultural collections of the 20th century; UC Santa Cruz is honored to receive this invaluable gift. The Grateful Dead and UC Santa Cruz are both highly innovative institutions—born the same year—that continue to make a major, positive impact on the world." Guitarist Bob Weir stated "We looked around, and UC Santa Cruz seems the best possible home. If you ever wrote the Grateful Dead a letter, you'll probably find it there!"[[172]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-172)

Professor of music [Fredric Lieberman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fredric_Lieberman "Fredric Lieberman") was the key contact between the band and the university, who let the university know about the search for a home for the archive, and who had collaborated with Mickey Hart on three books in the past, _Planet Drum_ (1990), _Drumming at the Edge of Magic_ (1991), and _Spirit into Sound_ (2006).[[173]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-173)[[174]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-174)[[175]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-goodreads-175)

The first large-scale exhibition of materials from the Grateful Dead Archive was mounted at the [New-York Historical Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New-York_Historical_Society "New-York Historical Society") in 2010.[[176]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-176)

In 2004, _[Rolling Stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling\_Stone\_(magazine) "Rolling Stone (magazine)")_ ranked the Grateful Dead No.57 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.[[177]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-177)

On February 10, 2007, the Grateful Dead received a [Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Lifetime_Achievement_Award "Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award"). The award was accepted on behalf of the band by Mickey Hart and Bill Kreutzmann.[[178]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-178)

In 2011, a recording of the Grateful Dead's May 8, 1977, concert at Cornell University's Barton Hall was selected for induction into the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress.[[179]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-179)

Twelve members of the Grateful Dead (the eleven official performing members plus Robert Hunter) were inducted into the [Rock and Roll Hall of Fame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame "Rock and Roll Hall of Fame") in 1994, and [Bruce Hornsby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Hornsby "Bruce Hornsby") was their presenter.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-rockhallgd1-6)

In 2024 the band was named as one of the recipients of the [Kennedy Center Honors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy_Center_Honors "Kennedy Center Honors"). The three living core members (Weir, Hart and Kreutzmann) received the award.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-Grateful_Dead,_Francis_Ford_Coppola,_Bonnie_Raitt_on_2024_Kennedy_Center_Honors_list-22) As he was named a recipient prior to his death, Lesh received the award posthumously.

Lead guitarist [Jerry Garcia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Garcia "Jerry Garcia") was often viewed both by the public and the media as the leader or primary spokesperson for the Grateful Dead, but was reluctant to be perceived that way, especially since he and the other group members saw themselves as [equal participants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_collective "Musical collective") and contributors to their collective musical and creative output.[[180]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-180)[[181]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-181) Garcia, a native of San Francisco, grew up in the [Excelsior District](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excelsior_District "Excelsior District"). One of his main influences was bluegrass music, and he also performed—on [banjo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banjo "Banjo"), one of his other great instrumental loves, along with the [pedal steel guitar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedal_steel_guitar "Pedal steel guitar")—in bluegrass bands, notably [Old & In the Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_%26_In_the_Way "Old & In the Way") with [mandolinist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandolin "Mandolin")[David Grisman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Grisman "David Grisman").

[Ned Lagin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ned_Lagin "Ned Lagin"), a young [MIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology "Massachusetts Institute of Technology") student and friend of the band, guested with them many times from 1970 through 1975, providing a second keyboard as well as synthesizers. Upon graduating from MIT, he began touring with the band fulltime in 1974, performing sets of electronic music with [Phil Lesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Lesh "Phil Lesh"), occasionally with Garcia and Kreutzmann, during the band's intermission.[[182]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-182) The "Ned and Phil" set became a regular fixture of that era, and was featured nearly every night during their Summer '74 and Europe '74 tours, as well as their five-night residency at the [Winterland Ballroom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winterland_Ballroom "Winterland Ballroom") during October 1974. Lagin is also featured in _[The Grateful Dead Movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Grateful\_Dead\_Movie "The Grateful Dead Movie")_. During 1974 and 1975, he would also occasionally play entire sets with the band, usually on Garcia's side of the stage, before ending his touring relationship with the band and focusing on his solo music projects, such as his album _[Seastones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seastones "Seastones")_, which features several members of the Dead.[[183]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-183)

[Bruce Hornsby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Hornsby "Bruce Hornsby") never officially joined the band full-time because of his other commitments, but he did play keyboards at most Dead shows between September 1990 and March 1992, and sat in with the band over 100 times in all between 1988 and 1995. He added several Dead songs to his own live shows[[184]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-184) and Jerry Garcia referred to him as a "floating member" who could come and go as he pleased.[[185]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-185)[[186]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-186)[[187]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-187)

[Robert Hunter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Hunter_(lyricist) "Robert Hunter (lyricist)") and [John Perry Barlow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Perry_Barlow "John Perry Barlow") were the band's primary [lyricists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyricist "Lyricist"), starting in 1967 and 1971, respectively, and continuing until the band's dissolution.[[188]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-Dead.net-RH-188)[[189]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-Dead.net-JPB-189) Hunter collaborated mostly with Garcia and Barlow mostly with Weir, though each wrote with other band members as well. Both are listed as official members at Dead.net, the band's website, alongside the performing members.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead#cite_note-Dead.net-band-16) Barlow was the only member not inducted into the [Rock and Roll Hall of Fame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame "Rock and Roll Hall of Fame").
