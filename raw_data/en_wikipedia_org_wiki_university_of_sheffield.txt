Its history traces back to the foundation of Sheffield Medical School in 1828, Firth College in 1879 and Sheffield Technical School in 1884.

[ 1 ] The University College of Sheffield was subsequently formed by the amalgamation of the three institutions in 1897 and was granted a royal charter as the University of Sheffield in 1905 by King Edward VII .

Sheffield is formed from 50 academic departments which are organised into five faculties and an international faculty. The annual income of the institution for 2023–24 was £887.9 million, of which £185.8 million was from research grants and contracts, with an expenditure of £651.4 million.

[ 3 ] Sheffield is regarded as one of the top engineering universities in Europe. As of the latest HESA statistics, it had the highest engineering research income and expenditure among all the universities in the UK for two consecutive years.

[ 11 ] The university is one of the original red brick universities and a founding member of the Russell Group . It is also part of the Worldwide Universities Network , the N8 Group of the eight most research intensive universities in Northern England and the White Rose University Consortium . According to the latest Research Excellence Framework 2021, Sheffield is ranked 11th in the UK for research power calculated by multiplying the institution's GPA by the total number of full-time equivalent staff submitted.

[ 12 ] There are six Nobel laureates affiliated with Sheffield, as either the alumni or former long-term staff of the university.

[ 13 ] They are contributors to the development of penicillin, the discovery of the citric acid cycle, the investigation of high-speed chemical reactions, the discovery of introns in eukaryotic DNA, the discovery of fullerene, and the development of molecular machines. Alumni also include several heads of state , Home Secretaries , Court of Appeal judges , Booker Prize winners, astronauts and Olympic gold medallists.

History [ edit ] Origins [ edit ] See also: History of Sheffield Medical School The University of Sheffield was originally formed by the merger of three local institutions: the Sheffield School of Medicine, Firth College, and the Sheffield Technical School. With a history dating back to as early as the 1810s, the Sheffield School of Medicine is the university's oldest predecessor institution, which is also the oldest higher education establishment in Sheffield. In 1795, the General Infirmary was opened, becoming the first hospital in the city. Because of the apprenticeship-type training, the medical education at that time was largely unstructured. Regarded as the father of Sheffield's medical education, surgeon apothecary Hall Overend began to train medical students in 1811.

[ 14 ] His school of anatomy and medicine was externally recognised in 1828, [ 15 ] and he conducted and taught human dissection in an anatomy museum at his home in Church Street . Overend, however, was not officially registered as a lecturer with the Society of Apothecaries , a recognised body for medical education.

[ 16 ] Physicians and surgeons of the General Infirmary suggested that a school associated with the hospital would be highly eligible for recognition by the society. As a result, in 1828, a public meeting was called by physician Sir Arnold Knight, and supported by Overend, to establish a new medical school. The Sheffield Medical Institution was formally opened a year later in 1829 on Surrey Street, with the Latin motto Ars longa vita brevis (Art is long, life is short), which refers to the difficulty to acquire and practice the art of Medicine.

[ 17 ] Knight laid the foundation stone and delivered the opening lecture.

[ 18 ] [ 16 ] The University Extension Movement emerged in the 1870s with the aim of providing education in the city which lacked any tertiary institutions.

[ 19 ] During the period, the steel industry in Sheffield was prospering and the city's population was doubled to around 240,000 from the 1840s.

[ 1 ] In 1871, the university extension scheme arrived in Sheffield, and a group of lecturers from the universities of Oxford and Cambridge travelled to the city giving lectures and educating people about the benefits of tertiary education. Steel manufacturer and former mayor of Sheffield Mark Firth and clergyman Samuel Earnshaw therefore organised courses in English literature and political economy. The courses became popular so Firth decided to donate £20,000 and purchase a site in the city centre (now Leopold Street and West Street) in 1877 to build a new institution for the classes.

[ 1 ] Firth College was founded during Firth's late year in 1879 and developed out of the Extension Movement scheme to teach arts and pure science subjects.

[ 20 ] The college saved the medical school, which had an insecure early history, from collapse and took over the teaching of all background subjects to medical students.

[ 21 ] In 1888 the medical school was relocated, opposite Firth College, to a new building on Leopold Street.

[ 18 ] Firth College also helped to fund the opening of the Sheffield Technical School in 1884 to teach applied science, the only major faculty the existing colleges did not cover. The Sheffield Technical School was created by collecting funds within Firth College because of local concern about the need for technical training, particularly steelmaking in Sheffield. Former mayor of Sheffield Sir Frederick Mappin started to fundraise for the school and £10,240 was raised.

[ 22 ] A grant was secured in 1883 to fund a professor of Metallurgy and Mechanical Engineering.

[ 1 ] Many of the steel-making firms in Sheffield contributed to funding the Technical School, and research from the school in turn helped develop new processes and products for the companies.

[ 23 ] The Technical School was originally founded as a new technical department in Firth College, and in 1886, the school moved to St George's Square (later renamed Charlotte Street and now Mappin Street) on the site of the old Grammar School .

[ 21 ] William Ripper was appointed as Head of Mechanical Engineering at Firth College from 1889, then Principal of Sheffield Technical School.

The original Firth College opened by former Master Cutler and Mayor of Sheffield Mark Firth in 1879 Foundation [ edit ] Sheffield was at that time the only large city in England without a university.

William Mitchinson Hicks , who was Principal of Firth College from 1892 to 1897, had an ambition to establish a university in the city.

[ 24 ] As a first stage of his ideal, Hicks was devoted to the union of the three higher education institutions in Sheffield and to transform Firth College into a university college . He also extended the college by creating new departments and adding new buildings.

[ 24 ] In 1897, Firth College merged with the Medical School and the Technical School to form the University College of Sheffield, and Hicks served as its first principal.

[ 1 ] [ 21 ] Six years since the foundation of the university college, on 18 May 1903, the resolution to apply for a royal charter was passed.

[ 25 ] The university college started to develop its estate soon after: Western House by Weston Park on Western Bank was bought and demolished in 1903 for building a new university property.

[ 25 ] A building with a traditional collegiate quadrangle (later known as Western Bank building and now Firth Court) was planned on the site.

[ 25 ] Sir Frederick Mappin later successfully sought financial support from the Sheffield City Council and appealed for public donations.

[ 25 ] In 1904, steelworkers, coal miners, factory workers and the people of Sheffield donated over £50,000 via penny donations to help found the University of Sheffield.

[ 26 ] William Mitchinson Hicks was the founding vice-chancellor of the university It was originally envisaged that the university college would join Manchester , Liverpool and Leeds as the fourth member of the federal Victoria University . The new university was proposed to be named "Victoria University of Yorkshire" by Leeds [ 27 ] but was rejected by the Privy Council.

[ 28 ] The Victoria University, however, began to split up as independent universities before this could happen, when Liverpool gained a charter of its own in 1903. Rather than joining a Yorkshire university with Leeds, the University College of Sheffield was driven by civic pride to pursue independent university status, [ 25 ] to bring higher education, give support to industries and serve as a centre for disease study. Hicks also advocated the independent degree awarding power would attract talented staff.

[ 1 ] The University College of Sheffield's charter was sealed on 31 May 1905 and became the University of Sheffield.

[ 25 ] On 12 July 1905, Firth Court on Western Bank was opened by King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra . St George's Square remained the centre of departments of Applied Science, and the departments of Arts, Medicine and Science moved to Western Bank.

[ 21 ] Sheffield is one of the six pre-World War One red brick universities , the civic universities founded in the major industrial cities of England.

20th century [ edit ] In 1905, when the university first opened, there were 363 students [ 29 ] and 114 of them were enrolled full-time.

[ 21 ] Sheffield at the time had 71 members of staff.

[ 29 ] By then, the first Hall of Residence (Stephenson Hall) and library (Edgar Allen library) had been established. The number of students increased to a short-lived peak of 1,000 in 1919 when returning ex-servicemen were admitted to the university. During the First World War , some of the academic subjects and courses were replaced by teaching of munitions making and medical appliances production.

[ 21 ] The university has expanded since the 1920s from two ends on Western Bank and on the St George's site.

[ 30 ] The number of full-time students was stabilized at about 750 between the two world wars.

[ 21 ] In 1943, the University Grants Committee announced that universities in the UK should look forward to expansion in the years after the Second World War .

[ 31 ] Sheffield predicted a 50% increase in student population but the university was unprepared for such growth. There was pressure on the university to expand since the student numbers had increased from around 1,000 to 3,000 by 1946.

[ 31 ] The university announced proposals for development in 1947, which emphasised the need for new departments, medical school, library, administration building, halls of residence, as well as the completion of the Western Bank quadrangle and the extension of the Students' Union.

[ 31 ] The Sir Frederick Mappin Building, home to the Faculty of Engineering, was refurbished from 2017 to 2020.

The university then grew slowly until the 1950s and 1960s when it began to expand rapidly. Many new buildings (including the Main Library and the Arts Tower ) were built and older houses were brought into academic use. Student numbers increased to their present levels of just under 26,000. At the same time in the 1950s, the university was expanding at other sites, including the St Georges area.

[ 30 ] From the 1960s, many more buildings have been constructed or extended, including the Union of Students and St George's Library. The campus master plan proposed in the 1940s was completed by the 1970s, and the university required a new development plan.

[ 32 ] The 1980s saw the opening of many new buildings and centres, such as the multi-purpose Octagon Centre and the Sir Henry Stephenson Building. The university's teaching hospital, Northern General Hospital , was also extended.

[ 31 ] In 1987 the university began to collaborate with its once would-be partners of the Victoria University by co-founding the Northern Consortium ; a coalition for the education and recruitment of international students.

[ 21 ] The university continued to expand in the 1990s. New premises were opened for School of the Clinical Dentistry, the Division of Education, and the Management School.

[ 31 ] In 1995, the university took over the Sheffield and North Trent College of Nursing and Midwifery, forming a new School of Nursing and Midwifery. The St George's Hospital was extended and a new building at the Northern General Hospital has been constructed, which greatly increased the size of the medical faculty.

Hans Adolf Krebs was appointed as lecturer in pharmacology in 1935. At Sheffield Krebs and his postgraduate student discovered the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle) in 1937, [ 33 ] [ 34 ] which earned him a Nobel Prize for Medicine and Physiology for 1953. In 1938, the university opened the Department of Biochemistry (renamed since the 1990s as the Department of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology) and Krebs became its first Head. Krebs Institute, a research centre for mechanistic biology, was founded in 1988 within the Department of Biochemistry.

George Porter joined the university as Professor of Physical Chemistry in 1955 and he further developed his later Nobel Prize-winning work flash photolysis at Sheffield. Porter was appointed Firth Professor of Chemistry and became Head of the Department of Chemistry in 1963.

[ 35 ] 21st century [ edit ] Octagon Centre, University of Sheffield In the 21st century, the university opened many more major buildings in the area immediately to the east and west of Upper Hanover Street , such as the Jessop Building, the Soundhouse, Jessop West and the Information Commons . The Arts Tower building, the Students' Union and University House buildings, the Sheffield Bioincubator and University Health Centre were also refurbished. A new campus, North Campus, was opened.

[ 21 ] In 2003, a development framework was produced by Turnberry Consulting, with proposals aimed to densify the campus.

[ 36 ] [ 37 ] In 2005, the South Yorkshire Strategic Health Authority announced that it would split the training between Sheffield and Sheffield Hallam University – however, the university decided to pull out of providing preregistration nursing and midwifery training due to "costs and operational difficulties".

[ 38 ] On 28 September 2015, a new six-storey building, the Diamond , was opened.

[ 39 ] In February 2016, the university started to work with Sheffield City Council to transform public spaces around the campus.

[ 40 ] The £8 million project includes building and improving pedestrianisation, crossings, cycle routes, as well as greening the campus.

[ 40 ] [ 41 ] The university intended to expand the Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre and provision for apprenticeships; however, while the Sheffield City Region Local Enterprise Partnership recommended that the £10 million funding bid should be approved, the university withdrew the bid in November 2018.

[ 42 ] The University Concourse was refurbished in 2019 to replace the 50-year-old paving and walls.

[ 43 ] Major development projects in the 2020s include constructions of a new Information School building (Northumberland Road Building), Social Sciences Building, Royce Discovery Centre, energy centre (the Transformer), Translational Energy Research Centre, and redevelopment of the original Henderson's factory .

[ 44 ] Campus and locations [ edit ] The University of Sheffield is not a campus university , though most of its 430 buildings are located in fairly close proximity to each other.

[ 44 ] It is divided geographically by the Sheffield Inner Ring Road .

[ 45 ] The Upper Hanover Street section of the ring road splits university buildings into the Western Bank and the St George's campus areas.

[ a ] Instead of growing from a single centre, since receiving its royal charter, the university has expanded from two academic foci about 1 km apart: Firth Court on Western Bank and Sir Frederick Mappin Building on St George's. The two foci started to fuse in the 1960s, as more buildings have been constructed or acquired by the university. The completion of the Information Commons and Jessop West buildings, in the late 2000s, bridges both west (Western Bank) and east (St George's) campus, [ 45 ] and in 2017, a new pedestrian crossing was installed on the Upper Hanover Street, physically connecting the two campus.

[ 45 ] The university campus is composed of an eclectic range of buildings from Victorian style to modernism to contemporary .

Sir Frederick Mappin Building and Central Block are two Victorian university buildings, now linked by a contemporary curved glass roof constructed in 2020. Opened as the Western Bank Building, Firth Court is a red brick Edwardian building in Perpendicular Revival style, [ 52 ] and is connected to the 1971 modernist Alfred Denny Building . The nearby Arts Tower is also an example of postwar modernist building in the International Style .

[ 53 ] The Diamond, a contemporary architecture designed by Twelve Architects, is situated next to the Victorian Jessop Building on the former site of Jessop's Edwardian wing.

[ 54 ] A total of 36 university estate are listed .

[ 45 ] Of these, the Arts Tower and Western Bank Library are Grade II* listed buildings. Firth Court, Mappin Building, St George's Church, Jessop Building and the Drama Studio are listed Grade II.

Main (Western Bank) Campus [ edit ] Main article: Western Bank Campus Firth Court on Western Bank is home to the biomedical sciences department and remains the main administrative centre of the university.

The centre of the university's presence lies one mile to the west of Sheffield city centre, where there is a mile-long collection of buildings belonging almost entirely to the university. This main campus area [ 36 ] is bounded by Upper Hanover Street to the east, Glossop Road to the south, Clarkson Street to the west, and Bolsover Street to the north. Western Bank ( A57 ) runs through the campus.

[ 45 ] The area to the north of Western Bank includes Firth Court , Alfred Denny Building , Western Bank Library and Arts Tower , Geography and Planning building, Bartolomé House , and Dainton and Richard Roberts Buildings. Within the southern area of the campus are the Sheffield Students' Union , the Octagon Centre , Graves Building and Hicks Building .

[ 55 ] A concourse under the A57 flyover connects Alfred Denny Building on the north side and Students' Union on the south. Until the completion of three pedestrian crossings on Western Bank in 2017, the concourse underpass was the only link that allowed students to easily move between buildings in this cluster.

[ 56 ] The Information Commons, a library and computing centre opened in 2007, is also located at the Western Bank Campus on Leavygreave Road. In addition, throughout 2010 the Western Bank Library received a £3.3 million restoration and refurbishment, the University of Sheffield Union of Students underwent a £5 million rebuild, and work commenced on a multimillion-pound refurbishment of the Grade II* listed Arts Tower to extend its lifespan by 30 years.

[ 57 ] St George's Campus [ edit ] To the east of the main campus lies St George's campus, named after St George's Church (now a lecture theatre and postgraduate residence). The campus is the historical location of the Sheffield Technical School. It is bounded by Upper Hanover Street to the west, Broad Lane to the north, Rockingham Street to the east, and West Street to the south, [ 45 ] and is part of St George's Quarter , one of the seven official Sheffield city centre quarters.

[ 58 ] Also known as the Engineering campus, [ 59 ] St George's campus is centred on Mappin Street, the location of the Faculty of Engineering (partly housed in the Grade II-listed Mappin Building ) and the Department of Journalism Studies, Department of Economics and Department of Computer Science . The university also maintains the Turner Museum of Glass in this area. As part of the 2000s development plan, the university has converted the listed Victorian Jessop Hospital for Women into the new home of the Department of Music in 2009. The formerly Grade II-listed Edwardian wing of the Jessop Hospital was demolished after Sheffield City Council's planning committee voted for approval.

[ 60 ] The building was replaced by a new £81 million building for the Faculty of Engineering which opened in September 2015, named the Diamond . It is a purpose-built multi-disciplinary building that houses lecture theatres, laboratories, workrooms and other facilities for the teaching of engineering.

[ 61 ] [ 62 ] Amongst the more recent additions to the university's estate located on this campus are the Soundhouse (2008; a music practice and studio facility) and the Jessop West building (2009; the first UK project by Berlin architects Sauerbruch Hutton ).

[ 63 ] Former St George's Church, now a lecture theatre The Sir Frederick Mappin Building is a Grade II-listed building in an area known as the St George's Complex. The building houses much of the Faculty of Engineering and St George's IT centre.

[ 64 ] Completed in 1885, the oldest part of the building, the former Sheffield Technical School, now the Central Wing, lies in the centre of the building. The extensive Mappin Street frontage includes the main entrance, the John Carr Library and Mappin Hall, and is connected to the Central Wing by a bridge. In early 2020, the Mappin Building and the Central Wing were refurbished. As a result of the refurbishments, the two buildings are joined by a quadruple-height atrium with curved glass roof.

[ 65 ] The atrium, called the Engineering Heartspace, houses laboratories, offices and social spaces.

[ 59 ] Given its name to the campus, St George's Church was the first of three commissioners' churches to be built in Sheffield under the Church Building Act 1818. It was built in the Perpendicular style. The church closed in 1981 and was acquired by the university. It was converted for use as a lecture theatre in 1994, [ 66 ] while the upstairs has been converted for use as student accommodation.

Other sites [ edit ] Further west lies Weston Park, the Weston Park Museum , the Harold Cantor Gallery , university's sports facilities Goodwin Sports Centre in the Crookesmoor area, and the Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and Health around the Royal Hallamshire Hospital (although these subjects are taught in the city's extensive teaching hospitals under the Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust , and throughout South Yorkshire and North East Lincolnshire ). It is in this area that the new £12 million Sheffield Institute for Translational Neuroscience (SITraN), opened by Queen Elizabeth II in November 2010, is located.

[ 67 ] There is a cluster of buildings located to the north of Broad Lane, opposite St George's campus, collectively called the north campus. Kroto Research Institute, Kroto Innovation Centre , Nanoscience and Technology Building, Graduate Research Centre, George Porter Building and the International College are based on this campus area.

[ 68 ] To the south of the city on Warminster Road are where the sports pitches at Norton Sports Park located.

[ 69 ] The university also operates Advanced Manufacturing Research Centres (AMRCs) on the border of Sheffield, in Rotherham and Lancashire.

[ 70 ] The Conference Centre and Teaching Hall at Philadelphia Campus of St. Thomas' Church are used as exam venues by the university.

[ 71 ] Former locations [ edit ] One of the university's Advanced Manufacturing Research Centres in Rotherham The old Firth College building was built in 1879 at the corner of Leopold Street and West Street. It was designed by Thomas James Flockton and Edward Robert Robson with the front facing West Street. Firth College moved out of the building following the establishment of the university. The building later housed the Sheffield Central Technical School and is currently home to Education Committee offices of Sheffield City Council.

[ 72 ] Situated on 7 Leopold Street opposite Firth College, the old Medical School building was designed by John Dodsley Webster and completed in 1888. The school moved to Firth Court in 1905 and the building is now used as offices.

[ 73 ] The Manvers campus, at Wath-on-Dearne between Rotherham and Barnsley , was where the majority of nursing was taught. A three-storey building, Humphry Davy House (named after chemist Humphry Davy ), was built in 1998 on Golden Smithies Lane opposite to Dearne Valley College .

[ 74 ] The building was home to the School of Nursing and Midwifery, which was established in 1995 after the merger of the university with Sheffield and North Trent College of Nursing and Midwifery.

[ 75 ] In 2004, the university disagreed with the South Yorkshire Strategic Health Authority's decision to take away part of its nursing and midwifery training contract, and declined the offer due to financial and operational constraints.

[ 38 ] The last intake of midwifery studies students was in July 2006, and the campus was closed one year later.

[ 74 ] The building was sold in 2018 and to be converted for residential lettings.

[ 76 ] From 2022 to 2023, students protested against the university working with and accepting payment for various activities from companies including Rolls Royce, BAE Systems, and Boeing who are involved in the arms manufacturing industry.

[ 7 ] Organisation [ edit ] Faculties and schools [ edit ] Sheffield had four faculties in 1905, which were Arts, Pure Science, Medicine and Applied Science. The Faculty of Applied Science later split into Engineering and Metallurgy in 1919.

[ 21 ] As well as educating full-time students, in the early 20th century, the university taught non-degree courses that covered non-conventional, occupation-focused subjects such as cow-keeping, railway economics, mining and razor-grinding.

[ 21 ] The current faculty and school structure is: Faculty of Arts and Humanities School of English School of History, Philosophy and Digital Humanities School of Languages, Arts and Societies School of Law Faculty of Engineering School of Chemical, Materials and Biological Engineering School of Computer Science School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering School of Mechanical, Aerospace and Civil Engineering Faculty of Health School of Allied Health, Nursing and Midwifery School of Clinical Dentistry School of Medicine and Population Health (including the Medical School ) Faculty of Science School of Biosciences School of Mathematical and Physical Sciences School of Psychology Faculty of Social Sciences School of Architecture and Landscape School of Economics School of Education School of Information, Journalism and Communication Management School School of Sociological Studies, Politics and International Relations Faculty of Arts and Humanities [ edit ] The Faculty of Arts and Humanities is made up of eight schools and departments. It is also home to three institutes (Humanities Research Institute, Sheffield Institute for Interdisciplinary Biblical Studies, and Digital Humanities Institute) and 16 research centres. The Centre for Research into Freemasonry and Fraternalism of the faculty was the first centre devoted to scholarly research into Freemasonry in a UK university.

[ 77 ] The centre was closed in 2010, ten years after its establishment, due to its failure to capture substantial grants to support the centre's activities.

[ 78 ] In May 2021, archaeology staff at the university have been told their jobs could be at risk after a review. A petition to save the department has gathered more than 35,000 signatures but the university said no decisions had yet been taken, but later changed to announcing they intended to dissolve the department, which was met with international outcry.

[ 79 ] [ 80 ] Faculty of Engineering [ edit ] The precursor to the Faculty of Engineering is the Sheffield Technical School established in the 1880s, which offered part-time and evening class programme to adults working in the steel industry.

[ 81 ] During 1917, departments of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Civil and Structural Engineering and Mechanical Engineering were founded in response to the needs of the First World War. The departments provided training courses for injured and incapacitated soldiers, and manufactured inspection gauges and munition shells.

[ 81 ] The Faculty of Engineering has now over 6,700 students and 1,000 staff.

[ 82 ] Over 90% of the research from the department was rated as 4* (world-leading) or 3* (internationally excellent).

[ 83 ] Faculty of Health [ edit ] The Faculty of Health is made up of three schools, which are the School of Applied Health, Nursing and Midwifery, the School of Clinical Dentistry, and the School of Medicine and Population Health (which includes the Medical School ; the oldest school of the University). The Medical School operated independently as the Sheffield School of Medicine until its mergers with Firth College and with Sheffield Technical School.

[ 84 ] The Medical School is located next to the Royal Hallamshire Hospital , one of the Sheffield's teaching hospitals, and the school is associated with Sheffield Children's Hospital , Northern General Hospital , Weston Park Hospital and Charles Clifford Dental Hospital . It is one of 32 bodies entitled to award medical degrees in the United Kingdom by the General Medical Council (GMC), the body responsible for registering doctors to practise medicine as well as regulating medical education and training in the United Kingdom.

[ 85 ] Faculty of Science [ edit ] The Faculty of Science comprises seven classical science departments: Animal and Plant Sciences, Biomedical Science, Chemistry, Mathematics and Statistics, Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, Physics and Astronomy, and Psychology. All of the university's six Nobel Laureates have been affiliated with this faculty.

[ 86 ] The Department of Animal and Plant Sciences is one of the largest departments dedicated for whole-organism biology studies in the UK.

[ 87 ] Biology has been taught in Sheffield since 1884 in Firth College. Appointed the first Professor of Biology in 1888, Alfred Denny was the only biologist in the Department of Biology at the college who taught zoology and botany to science and medical students. In 1896, a second biologist, botanist Bertram H. Bentley, joined the college.

[ 158 ] [ 161 ] It replaces the 1992 St George's Library on St George's Campus as the main engineering library and study space. The University of Sheffield Library is a member of Research Libraries UK .

[ 162 ] The Diamond Former libraries include Edgar Allen Library closed by the late 1950s and St George's Library closed on 14 June 2015. Edgar Allen Library was the first university library. In 1905 when the university was established, the library was housed in a lecture room due to lack of funds to construct a purpose-built library. William Edgar Allen, a member of the University Council, provided £10,000 to build a proper library named Edgar Allen Library, locating beside the main university building (Firth Court). Edgar Allen Library had 100 seats in its reading room, shelves for 20,000 books, and a stack space for 60,000 more books.

Sir Charles Harding Firth , the first lecturer in Modern History in Firth College, donated part of his personal collection to the library.

Sheffield Town Trustee also helped the university to transform the General Lecture Theatre into a reading room housing the Firth Collection (rare book collection of approximately 20,000 volumes) in 1931.

[ 163 ] As the university rapidly expanded in the 1950s, it became necessary to replace Edgar Allen Library with a modern post-war era library. The library, later known as the Western Bank Library, was opened on 12 May 1959.

[ 163 ] Edgar Allen Library (now the Rotunda in Firth Court) [ 164 ] became the Registrar and Secretary's Office. St George's Library (now 38 Mappin Street) was refurbished as an exam venue.

[ 173 ] The THM housed collections including a replica kitchen from the 1920s, reconstructed workshops and retail shops, such as Pollard's tea and coffee.

[ 172 ] [ 174 ] The university decided to close the Museum in 2011 because the building could not afford continued public access.

[ 172 ] [ 175 ] In 2013, the collections from the Traditional Heritage Museum were relocated and are accessible again to the public. The majority of the items was transferred to not-for-profit organisation Green Estate (operators of the Sheffield Manor Lodge ). Other major recipients include Sheffield Galleries and Museums Trust , Sheffield Industrial Museums Trust and Ken Hawley Trust.

[ 176 ] The Western Bank Library has an Exhibition Gallery.

[ 177 ] It is located on the mezzanine level of the library, enabling special collections from the university library and the National Fairground Archive to be displayed in controlled conditions.

[ 178 ] In 2010, the gallery was restored and refurbished by a grant from the Wolfson Foundation . The library usually schedules three temporary exhibitions per year, and most of the exhibitions are free to visit during library opening hours.

[ 179 ] Henry Clifton Sorby donated his lantern glass slide collection to the university library The Henry Clifton Sorby Collection contains glass lantern slides of marine organisms prepared and donated by Henry Clifton Sorby in the 1900s. Sorby was president of Firth College after the death of Mark Firth, vice-president of the University College of Sheffield, and a member of the Council of the University of Sheffield. His broad interests included marine biology, and he had developed a technique for preparing and mounting invertebrate marine animals onto slides. The specimens were cleared and stained so that enabling projection onto a screen for viewing. The glass lantern slides are now held in the Department Animal and Plant Sciences.

[ 180 ] The Sheffield Herbarium is also operated by the Department Animal and Plant Sciences, with a collection of preserved plant specimens collected in the late 19th century and early to mid 20th century.

[ 200 ] The decision had been made through a commissioned Institutional Review process chaired by Valentine and was met with national and international outcry including a petition signed by over 40,000 people.

[ 201 ] The decision was announced first on 19 May.

[ citation needed ] The review process had begun in February 2022 led by Valentine.

[ citation needed ] Involvement with the arms trade [ edit ] Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre conducts a wide range of research projects including some funded by arms manufacturers such as BAE Systems .

[ 191 ] In 2008, the university partnered with BAE Systems to launch a new Centre for Research in Active Control which aimed to improve the stealth of BAE Systems' submarines.

[ 202 ] In 2012 the Students Union voted in favour of the university ending all links with the arms trade.

[ 203 ] In October 2022, students occupied ' The Diamond ' over the university's alleged links with Rolls-Royce , and their involvement in arms manufacture.

[ 204 ] This resulted in the closure of the building, with the occupiers refusing to leave until negotiations with the Vice-Chancellor commenced. Over the past eight years, the university has received some £47 million from Rolls-Royce.

[ 205 ] The following month, the university hired a private investigator to investigate two students for "alleged misconduct" in relation to the protests.

[ 206 ] [ 207 ] In November 2023, students interrupted the opening ceremony of the university's newest building, in support of Palestine and in protest over the university's financial contracts with arms manufacturers, including BAE Systems, GKN and Boeing .

[ 210 ] In November 2009 a development project began to redevelop the Students' Union building, funded by £5 million by the HEFCE , which was completed and re-opened in September 2010. Works centred on improving circulation around the building by aligning previously disjointed floors, improving internal access between the Union building and neighbouring University House, and constructing a new entrance and lobby that incorporates the university's traditional colours of black and gold.

[ 211 ] During 2012–13 the Students' Union went under a further redevelopment costing £20 million which led to the refurbishment of the University House. University House, completed in 1963, has been integrated with the university's Students' Union in one single building.

[ 212 ] Student accommodation [ edit ] The university halls of residence comprises two separate sites: Ranmoor/Endcliffe and City.

[ 213 ] Ranmoor/Endcliffe is situated in the western suburb of Sheffield, which is close to Broomhill and Ecclesall Road . The Endcliffe Village was opened in 2008 and the Ranmoor Village in 2009.

[ 214 ] Ranmoor House, opened in the autumn term of 1968, was once the largest hall of residence at the university, housing around 800 students. As part of the university's Student Residences Strategy, Ranmoor House was demolished in March 2008, a year before the new Ranmoor Village was scheduled to open.

[ 215 ] The Endcliffe and Ranmoor villages have been together referred to as Ranmoor/Endcliffe since 2016. The Endcliffe Village was renamed "South accommodation (near Endcliffe)", and the Ranmoor Village "North accommodation (near Ranmoor)".

[ 213 ] City accommodation, including Allen Court, Broad Lane Court, St. George's Flats, Mappin Court and Studio 300, are located on the Main Campus, on St George's Campus, or near the North Campus.

[ 216 ] The varsity is divided into winter and summer competitions. Over 1,000 students from both universities compete in over 30 varsity sports in more than 70 events.

[ 216 ] The university's sports colours are black and gold. Sheffield won the Varsity competition in 2013, beating Hallam for the first time in ten years.
