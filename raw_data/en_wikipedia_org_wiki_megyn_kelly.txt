On election night, Fox News' decision desk projected that Obama would win the state of Ohio along with a second term after part of the results had been released. Republican operative Karl Rove objected to this projection, whereupon Kelly - with camera following - dramatically walked backstage to the decision desk and spoke with them; she also asked Rove, "Is this just math that you do as a Republican to make yourself feel better? Or is this real?" [ 33 ] [ 34 ] [ 35 ] [ 36 ] Kelly left America Live in July 2013 and took maternity leave . That October she began hosting a new nightly program, The Kelly File .

Kelly also said that Jesus was a white man later in the segment.

[ 40 ] Soon after, Jon Stewart , [ 41 ] Stephen Colbert , [ 42 ] Rachel Maddow , [ 43 ] Josh Barro , [ 44 ] and others satirized her remarks.

[ 45 ] Two days later, she said on the air that her original comments were " tongue-in-cheek ", [ 46 ] [ 47 ] [ 48 ] [ 49 ] [ 50 ] and that the skin color of Jesus is "far from settled".

[ 51 ] In June 2015, Kelly interviewed Jim Bob Duggar and Michelle Duggar of 19 Kids and Counting regarding their son Josh Duggar 's alleged molestation of five girls in 2002. She later interviewed two of their daughters, Jill and Jessa.

[ 53 ] Kelly's moderating generated a range of media and political reactions and her professionalism was crudely criticized by Trump.

[ 54 ] [ 55 ] [ 56 ] [ 57 ] Kelly responded to Trump's criticism by saying she would not "apologize for doing good journalism".

[ 58 ] Trump declined to attend the Iowa January 28 debate that she moderated.

[ 59 ] After the debate and off-camera, Ted Cruz said that Kelly had referred to Trump off-camera as " Voldemort ", though Fox News denied it.

[ 60 ] Bill Maher complimented Kelly as being "so much better" than the candidates who attended the January 28 debate and argued that she was a more viable candidate for the Republican nomination.

[ 61 ] According to reporting by The Atlantic , she had been "ordered" by Rupert Murdoch, then in control of Fox News, "to hit Trump hard".

[ 62 ] In an interview with CBS News Sunday Morning , Kelly reflected that she was disappointed with the lack of support she received from coworker Bill O'Reilly and CNN , the latter airing a Trump event the same time as the debate.

[ 63 ] [ 64 ] In April, at her request, [ 65 ] Kelly met with Trump at Trump Tower , having "a chance to clear the air".

[ 66 ] The following month, after interviewing Trump and being met with mixed reception, [ 67 ] she expressed interest in doing another one with him.

[ 68 ] In June, she criticized Trump for his claims against judge Gonzalo P. Curiel 's impartiality.

[ 70 ] In March 2016, it was announced that Kelly would host a one-hour prime time special on the Fox network wherein she would interview celebrities from the worlds of "politics, entertainment, and other areas of human interest".

[ 71 ] The special aired in May 2016, which was a sweeps month.

[ 72 ] It acquired 4.8 million viewers, but placed third in the ratings.

[ 73 ] Gabriel Sherman wrote of the stakes for Kelly as "high", elaborating that with Kelly being in the final year of her contract with Fox and having confirmed her ambitions, "[t]he special was essentially a public interview for her next job." [ 74 ] In July 2016, amid allegations of sexual harassment on the part of Fox News CEO Roger Ailes , Kelly was reported to have confirmed that she herself was also subjected to his harassment.

[ 75 ] [ 76 ] Two days after the report, Ailes resigned from Fox News and his lawyer, Susan Estrich , publicly denied the charge.

[ 77 ] During her coverage of the 2016 Republican National Convention , her attire received criticism.

[ 78 ] In a defense of Kelly, Jenavieve Hatch of The Huffington Post commented, "If you're a woman on national television reporting on a political event from hot, humid Cleveland, wearing a weather-appropriate outfit makes you the target of an endless stream of sexist commentary." [ 79 ] In September 2016, it was reported that Kelly would be collaborating with Michael De Luca to produce Embeds , a scripted comedy about reporters covering politics, to be aired on a streaming service.

[ 80 ] [ 81 ] Kelly appeared on the cover of the February 2016 issue of Vanity Fair .

[ 86 ] [ 87 ] She departed Fox News on January 6, 2017, after the last episode of The Kelly File was aired.

[ 88 ] [ 89 ] In January 2017 People , quoting an unspecified source, reported that Kelly remained under a non-compete clause with Fox until July 2017, which would prevent her from working for a competitor until the clause expired, unless it would be canceled prior.

[ 90 ] On June 2, 2017, Kelly interviewed Russian president Vladimir Putin , first in a panel discussion she moderated at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum and later in a one-on-one interview for the premiere episode of NBC's Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly , which aired June 4, 2017.

[ 91 ] [ 92 ] [ 93 ] Kelly's daytime talk show, Megyn Kelly Today , premiered in September 2017.

[ 94 ] [ 95 ] [ 96 ] [ 97 ] Kelly was paid reportedly between $15 million and $20 million a year at NBC.

[ 98 ] After an initial run of eight episodes in the summer of 2017, NBC decided to bring her newsmagazine show Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly back for summer 2018 after a hiatus for football and the Winter Olympics, but only periodically. However, this return never materialized.

[ 99 ] [ 100 ] Instead, Kelly continued to report stories for Dateline NBC during the summer of 2018, continuing her work for the show which she joined in 2017.

[ 101 ] On October 23, 2018, Kelly was criticized for on-air remarks she made on Megyn Kelly Today related to the appropriateness of blackface as part of Halloween costumes .

[ 104 ] Three days later, NBC canceled Megyn Kelly Today .

[ 105 ] It had been reported that Kelly was considering ending the program to focus on her role as a correspondent.

[ 115 ] [ 116 ] This marked her first return to moderating a presidential debate since her time at Fox News, where she famously moderated the first Republican Party presidential debate in 2015 .

[ 117 ] The debate, which was hosted by independent media figures, was part of the Republican National Committee 's move toward embracing alternative media platforms over traditional establishment networks.

[ 118 ] The event took place without the participation of Donald Trump , the leading Republican candidate at the time.

[ 119 ] On November 4, 2024, the day before the 2024 presidential election , Kelly publicly endorsed Donald Trump at a rally in Pittsburgh .

[ 121 ] While Kelly had previously clashed with Trump during the 2016 campaign , when he referred to her as "nasty" following a widely publicized debate exchange, her endorsement in 2024 revealed a stark change in their relationship.

[ 122 ] [ 123 ] On January 17, 2025, Kelly stated on her show that she would be attending Trump's second inauguration on January 20, and would be delivering remarks on stage at his rally the night before.

[ 134 ] In 2025, Kelly opened up about her shift in political standing over the years on The Megyn Kelly Show , stating that: [ 135 ] "When I was at Fox and then for that year at NBC, I was more in the center. I was like definitely center-right. Now I think I'm pretty conservative. I mean, I just am now. I mean, the earth has shifted such that I think I have to say, yes, by today's standards, you'd call me conservative. But that's thanks to them. What they did to me, they were vicious. They're complete assholes. Their woke ideology completely radicalized me against them. And I love that. It empowered me in a way that allowed me to see the truth about them. That was very helpful to me. I wouldn't undo it if I could because it really helped me understand who I was dealing with over there." — Megyn Kelly In response to the 2018 Parkland shooting , Kelly criticized lawmakers for their failure to pass meaningful gun reform, expressing frustration with the cycle of sorrow following mass shootings without real action. She argued that politicians lack the courage to push through change and that most proposed reforms would be ineffective.

[ 136 ] In June 2023, Kelly explained that her opinion had shifted from supporting " preferred pronouns " to opposing them, citing concerns about their connection to gender-affirming care for minors.

[ 137 ] In April 2024, Kelly revealed that she voted for Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election and would vote for him again in 2024 despite their turbulent relationship in the past. She explained that her decision was driven particularly by issues like transgender issues and cultural changes that were affecting her children. Kelly stated that her vote was based on principles rather than personal preference, emphasizing her desire to protect traditional values and preserve fundamental freedoms.

[ 138 ] [ 139 ] In October 2024, after Taylor Swift endorsed Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election , citing Tim Walz 's LGBTQ policies, Kelly criticized her during an on stage interview with Tucker Carlson . She accused Swift of "alienating half her fan base" by taking a side in a hotly contested presidential election, adding, about Walz's LGBTQ policies, "...and that is what Taylor Swift just endorsed for your children. So screw you, Taylor Swift." [ 140 ] Writing In February 2016, Kelly signed an agreement with HarperCollins to write an autobiography scheduled for release later that year, in a deal worth more than $10 million.
