[ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Nandy received the Fukuoka Asian Culture Prize in 2007.

[ 6 ] He received the Hans Killian Award in 2019.

[ 7 ] Early life and education [ edit ] Nandy was born in a Bengali Christian family [ 8 ] [ 9 ] at Bhagalpur , Bihar, in 1937. He is the eldest of three sons of Satish Chandra Nandy and Prafulla Nalini Nandy, and brother of Pritish Nandy . Later, his family moved to Calcutta . Nandy's mother was a teacher at La Martiniere School , Calcutta and subsequently became the school's first Indian vice principal. When he was 10, British India was partitioned into two sovereign countries – India and Pakistan. He witnessed the time of conflicts and atrocities that followed.

Nandy quit medical college after three years before joining Hislop College , Nagpur to study social sciences.

[ 10 ] Later he took a master's degree in sociology. However, his academic interest tended increasingly towards clinical psychology and he did his PhD in psychology at Dept. of Psychology, Gujarat University , Ahmedabad .

While a professed non-believer, Nandy identifies with the Bengali Christian community.

[ 11 ] Academic career [ edit ] Nandy joined the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS), Delhi, as a young faculty member. While working there, he developed his own methodology by integrating clinical psychology and sociology. Meanwhile, he was invited by a number of universities and research institutions abroad to carry out research and to give them lectures.  He served as the Director of CSDS between 1992 and 1997. He also serves on the Editorial Collective of Public Culture , a reviewed journal published by Duke University Press.

Nandy has coauthored a number of human rights reports and is active in movements for peace, alternative sciences and technologies, and cultural survival. He is a member of the Executive Councils of the World Futures Studies Federation , the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative , the International Network for Cultural Alternatives to Development, and the People's Union for Civil Liberties . Nandy has been a Woodrow Wilson Fellow at the Wilson Center , Washington, D.C., a Charles Wallace Fellow at the University of Hull , and a Fellow of the Institute for Advanced Studies in Humanities, University of Edinburgh . He held the first UNESCO Chair at the Center for European Studies, University of Trier , in 1994. In 2006 he became the National Fellow of the Indian Council of Social Science Research .

Nandy has explored a range of issues across politics, psychology, and society in his academic work. He has written extensively in last two decades. His 1983 book, titled The Intimate Enemy: Loss and Recovery of Self Under Colonialism , talked about the psychological problems posed at a personal level by colonialism, for both coloniser and colonised. Nandy argues that the understanding of self is intertwined with those of race, class, and religion under colonialism, and that the Gandhian movement can be understood in part as an attempt to transcend a strong tendency of educated Indians to articulate political striving for independence in European terms. Nandy's writings reflect his engagement with a wide range of topics, including political disputes, racial conflicts, and non-violence.

It was reported that he said: It is a fact that most of the corrupt come from OBCs and Scheduled Castes and now increasingly the Scheduled Tribes. I will give an example. One of the states with the least amount of corruption is state of West Bengal when the CPI(M) was there. And I must draw attention to the fact that in the last 100 years, nobody from OBC, SC and ST has come anywhere near to power. It is an absolutely clean state.

[ 12 ] Rajasthan Police lodged an FIR under the SC/ST Act against Ashis Nandy for his statement regarding corruption among the SC/ST and OBCs .

[ 13 ] After Nandy's lawyer moved the Supreme Court to quash all the allegations against him, the Court issued a stay order on his arrest on 1 February 2013.

[ 14 ] The subaltern scholar Dr. P. Satyanarayana of Vaagdevi College of Engineering in Warangal has challenged Nandy's remarks and expressed shock at the vociferous support he received for this from the Indian media and academia, asking rhetorically, "Is Prof. Nandy a holy cow?".

[ 15 ] [ neutrality is disputed ] Some scholars interpreted Nandy's controversial remarks as satirical, while others strongly criticized them as offensive and casteist. Nandy's use of sarcasm has been noted in academic contexts, though opinions about his statement were divided. In fact, he found support from academic quarters. In 2016–17, Nandy received the KK Daomdaran Award from the Sree Narayana Mandira Samiti for his academic contributions, including work related to marginalised communities and castes.

Views on Narendra Modi [ edit ] In 2019, The New Yorker magazine reported: [ 16 ] "During the dispute over Babri Masjid , Ashis Nandy began a series of interviews with R.S.S.

members. A trained psychologist, he wanted to study the mentality of the rising Hindu nationalists . One of those he met was Narendra Modi , who was then a little-known BJP functionary. Nandy interviewed Modi for several hours, and came away shaken. His subject, Nandy told [the reporter], exhibited all the traits of an authoritarian personality: puritanical rigidity, a constricted emotional life, fear of his own passions, and an enormous ego that protected a gnawing insecurity. During the interview, Modi elaborated a fantastical theory of how India was the target of a global conspiracy , in which every Muslim in the country was likely complicit. 'Modi was a fascist in every sense,' Nandy said. 'I don't mean this as a term of abuse. It's a diagnostic category.'"

I don't disown it, particularly because it is such a small community.
