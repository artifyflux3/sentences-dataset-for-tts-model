The **gradient theorem**, also known as the **fundamental theorem of calculus for line integrals**, says that a [line integral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_integral "Line integral") through a [gradient field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_vector_field "Conservative vector field") can be evaluated by evaluating the original scalar field at the endpoints of the curve. The theorem is a generalization of the [second fundamental theorem of calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_calculus "Fundamental theorem of calculus") to any curve in a plane or space (generally _n_-dimensional) rather than just the real line.

If _φ_: _U_ ⊆ **R**_n_ → **R** is a [differentiable function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_function "Differentiable function") and γ a [differentiable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_function "Differentiable function") curve in _U_ which starts at a point **p** and ends at a point **q**, then

![Image 1: {\displaystyle \int _{\gamma }\nabla \varphi (\mathbf {r} )\cdot \mathrm {d} \mathbf {r} =\varphi \left(\mathbf {q} \right)-\varphi \left(\mathbf {p} \right)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/876275519718498ba01a2b1fad005cb230e1f369)

where ∇_φ_ denotes the gradient vector field of _φ_.

The gradient theorem implies that line integrals through gradient fields are [path-independent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_vector_field#Path_independence "Conservative vector field"). In physics this theorem is one of the ways of defining a [_conservative_ force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_force "Conservative force"). By placing φ as potential, ∇_φ_ is a [conservative field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_field "Conservative field"). [Work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(physics) "Work (physics)") done by conservative forces does not depend on the path followed by the object, but only the end points, as the above equation shows.

The gradient theorem also has an interesting converse: any path-independent vector field can be expressed as the gradient of a [scalar field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_field "Scalar field"). Just like the gradient theorem itself, this converse has many striking consequences and applications in both pure and applied mathematics.

If φ is a [differentiable function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_function "Differentiable function") from some [open subset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_set "Open set")_U_ ⊆ **R**_n_ to **R** and **r** is a differentiable function from some closed [interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics) "Interval (mathematics)")[_a_, _b_] to U (Note that **r** is differentiable at the interval endpoints _a_ and _b_. To do this, **r** is defined on an interval that is larger than and includes [_a_, _b_].), then by the [multivariate chain rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_rule#Multivariable_case "Chain rule"), the [composite function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_composition "Function composition")_φ_ ∘ **r** is differentiable on [_a_, _b_]:

![Image 2: {\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} }{\mathrm {d} t}}(\varphi \circ \mathbf {r} )(t)=\nabla \varphi (\mathbf {r} (t))\cdot \mathbf {r} '(t)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c897b0b14f965ad4dd9223cb8d51fe07bbfd98fe)

for all t in [_a_, _b_]. Here the ⋅ denotes the [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product "Dot product").

Now suppose the domain U of φ contains the differentiable curve γ with endpoints **p** and **q**. (This is [oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientation_(vector_space) "Orientation (vector space)") in the direction from **p** to **q**). If **r**[parametrizes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametrization_(geometry) "Parametrization (geometry)")γ for t in [_a_, _b_] (i.e., **r** represents γ as a function of t), then

![Image 3: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\int _{\gamma }\nabla \varphi (\mathbf {r} )\cdot \mathrm {d} \mathbf {r} &=\int _{a}^{b}\nabla \varphi (\mathbf {r} (t))\cdot \mathbf {r} '(t)\mathrm {d} t\\&=\int _{a}^{b}{\frac {d}{dt}}\varphi (\mathbf {r} (t))\mathrm {d} t=\varphi (\mathbf {r} (b))-\varphi (\mathbf {r} (a))=\varphi \left(\mathbf {q} \right)-\varphi \left(\mathbf {p} \right),\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e3cf26b5be3fe6dc022116a46821a4326eb69b4f)

where the [definition of a line integral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_integral#Line_integral_of_a_vector_field "Line integral") is used in the first equality, the above equation is used in the second equality, and the [second fundamental theorem of calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_calculus#Second_part "Fundamental theorem of calculus") is used in the third equality.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_line_integrals#cite_note-1)

Even if the gradient theorem (also called _fundamental theorem of calculus for line integrals_) has been proved for a differentiable (so looked as smooth) curve so far, the theorem is also proved for a piecewise-smooth curve since this curve is made by joining multiple differentiable curves so the proof for this curve is made by the proof per differentiable curve component.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_line_integrals#cite_note-2)

Suppose _γ_ ⊂ **R**2 is the circular arc oriented counterclockwise from (5, 0) to (−4, 3). Using the [definition of a line integral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_integral#Line_integral_of_a_vector_field "Line integral"),

![Image 4: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\int _{\gamma }y\,\mathrm {d} x+x\,\mathrm {d} y&=\int _{0}^{\pi -\tan ^{-1}\!\left({\frac {3}{4}}\right)}((5\sin t)(-5\sin t)+(5\cos t)(5\cos t))\,\mathrm {d} t\\&=\int _{0}^{\pi -\tan ^{-1}\!\left({\frac {3}{4}}\right)}25\left(-\sin ^{2}t+\cos ^{2}t\right)\mathrm {d} t\\&=\int _{0}^{\pi -\tan ^{-1}\!\left({\frac {3}{4}}\right)}25\cos(2t)\mathrm {d} t\ =\ \left.{\tfrac {25}{2}}\sin(2t)\right|_{0}^{\pi -\tan ^{-1}\!\left({\tfrac {3}{4}}\right)}\\[.5em]&={\tfrac {25}{2}}\sin \left(2\pi -2\tan ^{-1}\!\!\left({\tfrac {3}{4}}\right)\right)\\[.5em]&=-{\tfrac {25}{2}}\sin \left(2\tan ^{-1}\!\!\left({\tfrac {3}{4}}\right)\right)\ =\ -{\frac {25(3/4)}{(3/4)^{2}+1}}=-12.\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/505054359476a4465d70c6f9b60fa763f7c12b2a)

This result can be obtained much more simply by noticing that the function ![Image 5: {\displaystyle f(x,y)=xy}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a3ee958d3d5aa49d9e3954ebf344a2bddd4f4485) has gradient ![Image 6: {\displaystyle \nabla f(x,y)=(y,x)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/afd145793846cd93651b639872097c68ae306b9f), so by the Gradient Theorem:

![Image 7: {\displaystyle \int _{\gamma }y\,\mathrm {d} x+x\,\mathrm {d} y=\int _{\gamma }\nabla (xy)\cdot (\mathrm {d} x,\mathrm {d} y)\ =\ xy\,|_{(5,0)}^{(-4,3)}=-4\cdot 3-5\cdot 0=-12.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f37d2805143836088b439361fa8032d9b7c43a11)

For a more abstract example, suppose _γ_ ⊂ **R**_n_ has endpoints **p**, **q**, with orientation from **p** to **q**. For **u** in **R**_n_, let |**u**| denote the [Euclidean norm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_norm "Euclidean norm") of **u**. If _α_ ≥ 1 is a real number, then

![Image 8: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\int _{\gamma }|\mathbf {x} |^{\alpha -1}\mathbf {x} \cdot \mathrm {d} \mathbf {x} &={\frac {1}{\alpha +1}}\int _{\gamma }(\alpha +1)|\mathbf {x} |^{(\alpha +1)-2}\mathbf {x} \cdot \mathrm {d} \mathbf {x} \\&={\frac {1}{\alpha +1}}\int _{\gamma }\nabla |\mathbf {x} |^{\alpha +1}\cdot \mathrm {d} \mathbf {x} ={\frac {|\mathbf {q} |^{\alpha +1}-|\mathbf {p} |^{\alpha +1}}{\alpha +1}}\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e2981f06a34575fb5cf25fd21352e18dbe6cb840)

Here the final equality follows by the gradient theorem, since the function _f_(**x**) = |**x**|_α_+1 is differentiable on **R**_n_ if _α_ ≥ 1.

If _α_< 1 then this equality will still hold in most cases, but caution must be taken if _γ_ passes through or encloses the origin, because the integrand vector field |**x**|_α_ − 1**x** will fail to be defined there. However, the case _α_ = −1 is somewhat different; in this case, the integrand becomes |**x**|−2**x** = ∇(log |**x**|), so that the final equality becomes log |**q**| − log |**p**|.

Note that if _n_ = 1, then this example is simply a slight variant of the familiar [power rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_rule "Power rule") from single-variable calculus.

Suppose there are n[point charges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_particle#Point_charge "Point particle") arranged in three-dimensional space, and the i-th point charge has [charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge "Electric charge")_Q_ _i_ and is located at position **p**_i_ in **R**3. We would like to calculate the [work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(physics) "Work (physics)") done on a particle of charge q as it travels from a point **a** to a point **b** in **R**3. Using [Coulomb's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coulomb%27s_law "Coulomb's law"), we can easily determine that the [force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force "Force") on the particle at position **r** will be

![Image 9: {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} (\mathbf {r} )=kq\sum _{i=1}^{n}{\frac {Q_{i}(\mathbf {r} -\mathbf {p} _{i})}{\left|\mathbf {r} -\mathbf {p} _{i}\right|^{3}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9f591bf628990b9bb8ff105651e28a4f33f6c248)

Here |**u**| denotes the [Euclidean norm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_norm "Euclidean norm") of the vector **u** in **R**3, and _k_ = 1/(4 _πε_ 0), where _ε_ 0 is the [vacuum permittivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_permittivity "Vacuum permittivity").

Let _γ_ ⊂ **R**3 − {**p**1, ..., **p**_n_} be an arbitrary differentiable curve from **a** to **b**. Then the work done on the particle is

![Image 10: {\displaystyle W=\int _{\gamma }\mathbf {F} (\mathbf {r} )\cdot \mathrm {d} \mathbf {r} =\int _{\gamma }\left(kq\sum _{i=1}^{n}{\frac {Q_{i}(\mathbf {r} -\mathbf {p} _{i})}{\left|\mathbf {r} -\mathbf {p} _{i}\right|^{3}}}\right)\cdot \mathrm {d} \mathbf {r} =kq\sum _{i=1}^{n}\left(Q_{i}\int _{\gamma }{\frac {\mathbf {r} -\mathbf {p} _{i}}{\left|\mathbf {r} -\mathbf {p} _{i}\right|^{3}}}\cdot \mathrm {d} \mathbf {r} \right)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/10c6db5ad37daa199326a2e4961193ed9fc1c15f)

Now for each i, direct computation shows that

![Image 11: {\displaystyle {\frac {\mathbf {r} -\mathbf {p} _{i}}{\left|\mathbf {r} -\mathbf {p} _{i}\right|^{3}}}=-\nabla {\frac {1}{\left|\mathbf {r} -\mathbf {p} _{i}\right|}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2173f94be5e5fd009c12565dd93bdec71d9d83dc)

Thus, continuing from above and using the gradient theorem,

![Image 12: {\displaystyle W=-kq\sum _{i=1}^{n}\left(Q_{i}\int _{\gamma }\nabla {\frac {1}{\left|\mathbf {r} -\mathbf {p} _{i}\right|}}\cdot \mathrm {d} \mathbf {r} \right)=kq\sum _{i=1}^{n}Q_{i}\left({\frac {1}{\left|\mathbf {a} -\mathbf {p} _{i}\right|}}-{\frac {1}{\left|\mathbf {b} -\mathbf {p} _{i}\right|}}\right)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7dc215109a18502e58630a215dbf460cb2845ae5)

We are finished. Of course, we could have easily completed this calculation using the powerful language of [electrostatic potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_potential "Electric potential") or [electrostatic potential energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_potential_energy "Electric potential energy") (with the familiar formulas _W_ = −Δ _U_ = −_q_ Δ _V_). However, we have not yet _defined_ potential or potential energy, because the _converse_ of the gradient theorem is required to prove that these are well-defined, differentiable functions and that these formulas hold ([see below](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_line_integrals#Example_of_the_converse_principle)). Thus, we have solved this problem using only Coulomb's Law, the definition of work, and the gradient theorem.

Converse of the gradient theorem
--------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gradient_theorem&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Converse of the gradient theorem")]

The gradient theorem states that if the vector field **F** is the gradient of some scalar-valued function (i.e., if **F** is [conservative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_vector_field "Conservative vector field")), then **F** is a path-independent vector field (i.e., the integral of **F** over some piecewise-differentiable curve is dependent only on end points). This theorem has a powerful converse:

**Theorem**— If **F** is a path-independent vector field, then **F** is the gradient of some scalar-valued function.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_line_integrals#cite_note-wt-3)

It is straightforward to show that a vector field is path-independent if and only if the integral of the vector field over every closed loop in its domain is zero. Thus the converse can alternatively be stated as follows: If the integral of **F** over every closed loop in the domain of **F** is zero, then **F** is the gradient of some scalar-valued function.

### Proof of the converse

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gradient_theorem&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Proof of the converse")]

Suppose U is an [open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_set "Open set"), [path-connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_space#Path_connectedness "Connected space") subset of **R**_n_, and **F**: _U_ → **R**_n_ is a [continuous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function "Continuous function") and path-independent vector field. Fix some element **a** of U, and define _f_: _U_ → **R** by![Image 13: {\displaystyle f(\mathbf {x} ):=\int _{\gamma [\mathbf {a} ,\mathbf {x} ]}\mathbf {F} (\mathbf {u} )\cdot \mathrm {d} \mathbf {u} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c805a8f1433ad8eed3904fe6b0ca4266728ea3e1)Here _γ_[**a**, **x**] is any (differentiable) curve in U originating at **a** and terminating at **x**. We know that _f_ is [well-defined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-defined "Well-defined") because **F** is path-independent.

Let **v** be any nonzero vector in **R**_n_. By the definition of the [directional derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directional_derivative "Directional derivative"),![Image 14: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\frac {\partial f(\mathbf {x} )}{\partial \mathbf {v} }}&=\lim _{t\to 0}{\frac {f(\mathbf {x} +t\mathbf {v} )-f(\mathbf {x} )}{t}}\\&=\lim _{t\to 0}{\frac {\int _{\gamma [\mathbf {a} ,\mathbf {x} +t\mathbf {v} ]}\mathbf {F} (\mathbf {u} )\cdot \mathrm {d} \mathbf {u} -\int _{\gamma [\mathbf {a} ,\mathbf {x} ]}\mathbf {F} (\mathbf {u} )\cdot d\mathbf {u} }{t}}\\&=\lim _{t\to 0}{\frac {1}{t}}\int _{\gamma [\mathbf {x} ,\mathbf {x} +t\mathbf {v} ]}\mathbf {F} (\mathbf {u} )\cdot \mathrm {d} \mathbf {u} \end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f89a96d6facfd26cb08b40eb11c5ddd5d7eb5c54)To calculate the integral within the final limit, we must [parametrize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametrization_(geometry) "Parametrization (geometry)")_γ_[**x**, **x** + _t_**v**]. Since **F** is path-independent, U is open, and t is approaching zero, we may assume that this path is a straight line, and parametrize it as **u**(_s_) = **x** + _s_**v** for 0 <_s_<_t_. Now, since **u'**(_s_) = **v**, the limit becomes![Image 15: {\displaystyle \lim _{t\to 0}{\frac {1}{t}}\int _{0}^{t}\mathbf {F} (\mathbf {u} (s))\cdot \mathbf {u} '(s)\,\mathrm {d} s={\frac {\mathrm {d} }{\mathrm {d} t}}\int _{0}^{t}\mathbf {F} (\mathbf {x} +s\mathbf {v} )\cdot \mathbf {v} \,\mathrm {d} s{\bigg |}_{t=0}=\mathbf {F} (\mathbf {x} )\cdot \mathbf {v} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/cba1b8bda919a374dbbec83dec9d6d80319fc50e)where the first equality is from [the definition of the derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative#Definition "Derivative") with a fact that the integral is equal to 0 at t = 0, and the second equality is from the [first fundamental theorem of calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_calculus#First_part "Fundamental theorem of calculus"). Thus we have a formula for ∂**v**_f_, (one of ways to represent the [directional derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directional_derivative "Directional derivative")) where **v** is arbitrary; for ![Image 16: {\displaystyle f(\mathbf {x} ):=\int _{\gamma [\mathbf {a} ,\mathbf {x} ]}\mathbf {F} (\mathbf {u} )\cdot \mathrm {d} \mathbf {u} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c805a8f1433ad8eed3904fe6b0ca4266728ea3e1) (see its full definition above), its directional derivative with respect to **v** is![Image 17: {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial f(\mathbf {x} )}{\partial \mathbf {v} }}=\partial _{\mathbf {v} }f(\mathbf {x} )=D_{\mathbf {v} }f(\mathbf {x} )=\mathbf {F} (\mathbf {x} )\cdot \mathbf {v} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4c7303f93b86905a97a6f73ae0ae2f1a9c2554b3)where the first two equalities just show different representations of the directional derivative. According to [the definition of the gradient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient#Definition "Gradient") of a scalar function _f_, ![Image 18: {\displaystyle \nabla f(\mathbf {x} )=\mathbf {F} (\mathbf {x} )}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3b97be5f3fc325683179627ada891a35402a6e16), thus we have found a scalar-valued function f whose gradient is the path-independent vector field **F** (i.e., **F** is a conservative vector field.), as desired.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_line_integrals#cite_note-wt-3)

### Example of the converse principle

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gradient_theorem&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Example of the converse principle")]

To illustrate the power of this converse principle, we cite an example that has significant [physical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics") consequences. In [classical electromagnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_electromagnetism "Classical electromagnetism"), the [electric force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_force "Electric force") is a path-independent force; i.e. the [work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(physics) "Work (physics)") done on a particle that has returned to its original position within an [electric field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_field "Electric field") is zero (assuming that no changing [magnetic fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field "Magnetic field") are present).

Therefore, the above theorem implies that the electric [force field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_field_(physics) "Force field (physics)")**F**_e_: _S_ → **R**3 is conservative (here S is some [open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_set "Open set"), [path-connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_space#Path_connectedness "Connected space") subset of **R**3 that contains a [charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge "Electric charge") distribution). Following the ideas of the above proof, we can set some reference point **a** in S, and define a function _U e_: _S_ → **R** by

![Image 19: {\displaystyle U_{e}(\mathbf {r} ):=-\int _{\gamma [\mathbf {a} ,\mathbf {r} ]}\mathbf {F} _{e}(\mathbf {u} )\cdot \mathrm {d} \mathbf {u} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9b23954ce1b0ea58ce87a6b7f1da7538c6ca224b)

Using the above proof, we know _U_ _e_ is well-defined and differentiable, and **F**_e_ = −∇_U e_ (from this formula we can use the gradient theorem to easily derive the well-known formula for calculating work done by conservative forces: _W_ = −Δ _U_). This function _U_ _e_ is often referred to as the [electrostatic potential energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_potential_energy "Electric potential energy") of the system of charges in S (with reference to the zero-of-potential **a**). In many cases, the domain S is assumed to be [unbounded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounded_set "Bounded set") and the reference point **a** is taken to be "infinity", which can be made [rigorous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigour#Mathematical_rigour "Rigour") using limiting techniques. This function _U_ _e_ is an indispensable tool used in the analysis of many physical systems.

Many of the critical theorems of vector calculus generalize elegantly to statements about the [integration of differential forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_form#Integration "Differential form") on [manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_manifold "Differentiable manifold"). In the language of [differential forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_form "Differential form") and [exterior derivatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exterior_derivative "Exterior derivative"), the gradient theorem states that

![Image 20: {\displaystyle \int _{\partial \gamma }\phi =\int _{\gamma }\mathrm {d} \phi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d89627e3e6f421a76910bfc8f7391d0d33ddace9)

for any [0-form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_form "Differential form"), ϕ, defined on some differentiable curve _γ_ ⊂ **R**_n_ (here the integral of _ϕ_ over the boundary of the γ is understood to be the evaluation of _ϕ_ at the endpoints of _γ_).

Notice the striking similarity between this statement and the [generalized Stokes’ theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_Stokes_theorem "Generalized Stokes theorem"), which says that the integral of any [compactly supported](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_support "Compact support") differential form ω over the [boundary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(topology) "Boundary (topology)") of some [orientable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientation_(vector_space) "Orientation (vector space)") manifold Ω is equal to the integral of its [exterior derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exterior_derivative "Exterior derivative")d _ω_ over the whole of Ω, i.e.,

![Image 21: {\displaystyle \int _{\partial \Omega }\omega =\int _{\Omega }\mathrm {d} \omega }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/97f4bc201dcac2d4a5e5e8aa9f5f85a8047bbeb5)

This powerful statement is a generalization of the gradient theorem from 1-forms defined on one-dimensional manifolds to differential forms defined on manifolds of arbitrary dimension.

The converse statement of the gradient theorem also has a powerful generalization in terms of differential forms on manifolds. In particular, suppose ω is a form defined on a [contractible domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contractible_space "Contractible space"), and the integral of ω over any closed manifold is zero. Then there exists a form ψ such that _ω_ = d _ψ_. Thus, on a contractible domain, every [closed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_and_exact_differential_forms "Closed and exact differential forms") form is [exact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_and_exact_differential_forms "Closed and exact differential forms"). This result is summarized by the [Poincaré lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_and_exact_differential_forms#Poincar%C3%A9_lemma "Closed and exact differential forms").
