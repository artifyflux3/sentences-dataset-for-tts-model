[ 1 ] Life [ edit ] Wanda Montlak was born on 5 April 1918 in Warsaw . She completed high school in 1935 and married, taking the name Szmielew. In the same year she entered the University of Warsaw , where she studied logic under Adolf Lindenbaum , Jan Łukasiewicz , Kazimierz Kuratowski , and Alfred Tarski . Her research at this time included work on the axiom of choice , but it was interrupted by the 1939 Invasion of Poland .

[ 1 ] Szmielew became a surveyor during World War II , during which time she continued her research on her own, developing a decision procedure based on quantifier elimination for the theory of abelian groups. She also taught for the Polish underground. After the liberation of Poland, Szmielew took a position at the University of Łódź , which was founded in May 1945. In 1947, she published her paper on the axiom of choice, earned a master's degree from the University of Warsaw, and moved to Warsaw as a senior assistant.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] In 1949 and 1950, Szmielew visited the University of California, Berkeley , where Tarski had found a permanent position after being exiled from Poland for the war. She 
lived in the home of Tarski and his wife as Tarski's mistress, leaving her husband behind in Poland, [ 3 ] and completed a Ph.D. at Berkeley in 1950 under Tarski's supervision, with her dissertation consisting of her work on abelian groups.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 4 ] For the 1955 journal publication of these results, Tarski convinced Szmielew to rephrase her work in terms of his theory of arithmetical functions, a decision that caused this work to be described by Solomon Feferman as "unreadable".

[ 5 ] Later work by Eklof & Fischer (1972) re-proved Szmielew's result using more standard model-theoretic techniques.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] Returning to Warsaw as an assistant professor, her interests shifted to the foundations of geometry . With Karol Borsuk , she published a text on the subject in 1955 (translated into English in 1960), and another monograph, published posthumously in 1981 and (in English translation) 1983.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] She died of cancer on 27 August 1976 in Warsaw.
