It is known for being, along with the 16th arrondissement and the commune of Neuilly-sur-Seine, the richest neighbourhood in France. In spoken French, this arrondissement is referred to as le septième .

The arrondissement, called Palais-Bourbon in a reference to the seat of the National Assembly , includes some of the major and well-known tourist attractions of Paris, such as the Eiffel Tower , the Hôtel des Invalides ( Napoleon 's resting place), the Chapel of Our Lady of the Miraculous Medal , [ 2 ] as well as a concentration of museums such as the Musée d'Orsay , Musée Rodin and the Musée du Quai Branly – Jacques Chirac .

Situated on the Rive Gauche —the "Left" bank of the River Seine —this central arrondissement, which includes the historical aristocratic neighbourhood of Faubourg Saint-Germain , contains a number of French national institutions, among them the National Assembly and numerous government ministries . It is also home to many foreign diplomatic embassies , some of them occupying outstanding hôtels particuliers .

The arrondissement has been home to the French upper class since the 17th century, when it became the new residence of France's highest nobility . The district has been so fashionable within the French aristocracy that the phrase le Faubourg —referring to the ancient name of the current 7th arrondissement—has been used to describe French nobility ever since.

[ 3 ] The 7th arrondissement of Paris and Neuilly-sur-Seine form the most affluent and prestigious residential area in France.

[ 4 ] History [ edit ] Construction of Hôtel de Salm , 1787. Paris, Musée Carnavalet .

Exposition Universelle in 1889, the entrance arch is known as the Eiffel Tower During the 17th century, French high nobility started to move from the central Marais , the then-aristocratic district of Paris where nobles used to build their urban mansions [ 5 ] (see Hotel de Soubise ), to the clearer, less populated and less polluted Faubourg Saint-Germain .

The district became so fashionable within the French aristocracy that the phrase le Faubourg has been used to describe French nobility ever since.

[ 3 ] The oldest and most prestigious families of the French nobility built outstanding residences in the area, such as the Hôtel Matignon , the Hôtel de Salm , and the Hôtel Biron .

After the Revolution many of these mansions , offering magnificent inner spaces, many reception rooms and exquisite decoration, were confiscated and turned into national institutions. The French expression "les ors de la Republique" (literally "the golds of the Republic" ), refers to the luxurious environment of the national palaces (outstanding official residences and priceless works of art), comes from that time.

During the Restauration , the Faubourg recovered its past glory as the most exclusive high nobility district of Paris and was the political heart of the country, home to the Ultra Party. After the Fall of Charles X , the district lost most of its political influence but remained the centre of the French upper class ' social life .

During the 19th century, the arrondissement hosted no fewer than five Universal Exhibitions ( 1855 , 1867 , 1878 , 1889 , 1900 ) that have immensely impacted its cityscape. The Eiffel Tower and the Orsay building were built for these Exhibitions (respectively in 1889 and 1900).

Geography [ edit ] The arrondissement has a total land area of 4.088 km 2 (1.578 sq mi; 1,010 acres). It has an average elevation of 47 m, with a minimum of 25 m and a maximum of 71 m.

[ 6 ] The 7th arrondissement borders the left bank of the Seine to the north, Rue des Saints-Pères to the east, and Rue de Sèvres to the south-east.

Demography [ edit ] The 7th arrondissement attained its peak population in 1926 when it had 110,684 inhabitants. Because it is the location of so many French government bodies, this arrondissement has never been as densely populated as some of the others.

[ citation needed ] In 1999, the population was 56,985, while the arrondissement provided 76,212 jobs.

Historical population [ edit ] Year (of French censuses) Population Density (inh. pr km 2 ) 1872 78,553 19,206 1926 (peak year) 110,684 27,075 1954 104,412 25,529 1962 99,584 24,360 1968 87,811 21,480 1975 74,250 18,163 1982 67,461 16,502 1990 62,939 15,396 1999 56,985 13,940 2009 57,442 14,045 Immigration [ edit ] Place of birth of residents of the 7th arrondissement in 1999 Born in metropolitan France Born outside metropolitan France 78.3% 21.7% Born in overseas France Born in foreign countries with French citizenship at birth 1 EU-15 immigrants 2 Non-EU-15 immigrants 0.5% 4.9% 7.4% 8.9% 1 This group is made up largely of former French settlers, such as pieds-noirs in Northwest Africa , followed by former colonial citizens who had French citizenship at birth (such as was often the case for the native elite in French colonies), as well as to a lesser extent foreign-born children of French expatriates. A foreign country is understood as a country not part of France in 1999, so a person born for example in 1950 in Algeria, when Algeria was an integral part of France, is nonetheless listed as a person born in a foreign country in French statistics.

2 An immigrant is a person born in a foreign country not having French citizenship at birth. An immigrant may have acquired French citizenship since moving to France, but is still considered an immigrant in French statistics. On the other hand, persons born in France with foreign citizenship (the children of immigrants) are not listed as immigrants.
