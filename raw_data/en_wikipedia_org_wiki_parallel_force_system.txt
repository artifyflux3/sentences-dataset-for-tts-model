Find sources: "Parallel force system" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( December 2018 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Parallel vertical forces acting on an airplane in straight and level flight.  Lift from the main wing (Pz) is balanced by the weight of the airplane (mg) and the down-force on the horizontal stabilizer (Pzh).

In engineering , a parallel force system is a type of force system where in all forces are oriented along one axis.

An example of this type of system is a see saw .  In a see saw, the children apply the two forces at the ends, and the fulcrum in the middle gives the counter force to maintain the see saw in a neutral position.

Another example are the major vertical forces on an airplane in flight.
