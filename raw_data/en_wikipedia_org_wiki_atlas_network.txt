Atlas Network Founder Antony Fisher Established 1981 ; 44 years ago ( 1981 ) Chair Montgomery Brown Chief executive officer Brad Lips Budget Revenue: $28.8 million Expenses: $22.1 million (2023) [ 1 ] Members 581 (2024) Formerly called Atlas Economic Research Foundation Location Arlington County, Virginia , U.S.

Website www .atlasnetwork .org Atlas Network , formerly known as Atlas Economic Research Foundation , is a non-governmental 501(c)(3) organization based in the United States that provides training, networking, and grants for libertarian , free-market , and conservative groups around the world.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] Atlas Network was founded in 1981 by Antony Fisher , a British entrepreneur, who wanted to connect various think tanks via a global network. Described as "a think tank that creates think tanks," the organization partners with nearly 600 organizations in over 100 countries.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] History [ edit ] Background and founding [ edit ] Atlas Network was founded in 1981 in San Francisco as the Atlas Economic Research Foundation by Antony Fisher , a British entrepreneur who was influenced by Austrian School economist F.A. Hayek and his 1944 book The Road to Serfdom .

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] After founding the Institute of Economic Affairs in London in 1955, Fisher had helped establish the Fraser Institute , the International Center for Economic Policy Studies (later renamed the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research), and the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy in the 1970s.

[ 10 ] The late Linda Whetstone , Fisher's daughter, served as chairman of Atlas Network.

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] F.A. Hayek, Margaret Thatcher , and Milton Friedman , all friends of Fisher, formally endorsed the organization.

[ 8 ] [ 5 ] Atlas Network connected various think tanks via a global network, [ 13 ] and was part of a transatlantic network including academics, journalists, and businesspeople who supported and promoted like minded ideology.

[ 14 ] In the words of Richard Meagher, it was founded as a "think tank that creates think tanks".

[ 4 ] [ 15 ] Early years, expansion, and influence [ edit ] Fisher conceived Atlas Network as a means to connect various think tanks via a global network through which the organizations could learn best practices from one another and "pass the best research and policy ideas from one to the other".

[ 16 ] Initially comprising only Fisher's think tanks, Atlas Network grew to include many others, including those affiliated with the Koch family .

[ 17 ] Atlas Network says that the organization is not named after Ayn Rand 's novel Atlas Shrugged .

[ 18 ] Atlas Network has received funding from American and European businesses and think tanks to coordinate and organize libertarian organizations in the developing world.

[ 2 ] In 1981, Atlas Network helped economist Hernando de Soto found the Institute for Liberty and Democracy (ILD) in Peru , [ 5 ] and also invested in the Institut Economique de Paris (IEP) in France.

[ 19 ] In 1983, Fisher helped launch the National Center for Policy Analysis (NCPA) in Dallas, Texas , [ 5 ] and the Jon Thorlaksson Institute in Iceland (now replaced by the Icelandic Research Centre for Innovation and Economic Growth).

[ 19 ] Atlas Network helped establish the Hong Kong Centre for Economic Research in 1987 and the Liberty Institute in New Delhi in 1996.

[ 5 ] Atlas Network grew from 15 think tanks in nine countries in the mid-1980s to 457 think tanks in 96 countries as of 2020.

[ 5 ] The 2019 and 2020 Global Go To Think Tank Index Report ranked Atlas Network as 54th among the "Top Think Tanks in the United States".

[ 20 ] [ 21 ] Atlas Network's think tank partners "produce white papers, meet with politicos, liaise with the media, write legislation, and much more", as described by WNYC .

[ 22 ] [ 23 ] In 2018, academic Karin Fischer described Atlas Network campaigns for deregulation and property rights as having so much influence that the World Bank 's Doing Business Index "follows exactly Atlas' policy recommendations".

[ 24 ] Atlas Network has promoted entrepreneurship in Africa and other parts of the world, including what it calls "freedom-oriented idea entrepreneurs." [ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ] Atlas Network also promotes "classically liberal policies and ideas." [ 28 ] According to The Guardian in 2019, more than one-fifth of Atlas Network partners worldwide had either opposed tobacco controls or taken tobacco donations.

[ 29 ] [ 30 ] A 2017 paper in the International Journal of Health Planning and Management said that Atlas Network "channeled funding from tobacco corporations to think tank actors to produce publications supportive of industry positions." [ 31 ] The University of Bath 's Tobacco Control Research Group said Atlas Network "appears to have played a particular role in helping the tobacco industry oppose tobacco control measures in Latin America" during the 1990s.

[ 32 ] Atlas Network and its partners, such as the Canadian Taxpayers Federation , Cato Institute , and Fraser Institute , [ 33 ] have been linked to oil and gas producers, as well as efforts opposing governments' and activists' efforts against climate change .

[ 34 ] [ 35 ] [ 36 ] [ 37 ] According to documents described in The Guardian , Atlas Network collaborated with Canada's Macdonald–Laurier Institute in a push for oil and gas development on Indigenous land.

[ 38 ] [ 39 ] After The New Republic blamed Atlas Network for its partners' efforts in some countries to criminalize climate protests , particularly in Germany, [ 17 ] Atlas Network said it supports free speech for climate protesters.

[ 40 ] Atlas Network told The New Republic that it has "no partnerships with extractive industries such as oil and gas companies, we receive no funding from oil and gas companies and have not received funding from oil and gas companies for nearly 15 years." [ 17 ] In April 2025, Atlas Network again denied receiving any funding from "extractive industries." [ 41 ] Political ties [ edit ] Atlas Network describes itself as non-partisan.

[ 42 ] The group does not get involved in campaigns or elections, although it does help train local think tanks on how to influence both the public and policymakers. According to ABC News Australia , Atlas Network partners are "taught how to win the battle for hearts and minds." [ 43 ] The Intercept , The Guardian , and The New Republic have described Atlas Network as having ties to conservative movements, including the administration of Donald Trump in the United States, Brexit in the United Kingdom, [ 44 ] and anti-government protests in Latin America.

[ 45 ] [ 17 ] A 2024 study analyzing 52 Atlas Network partners found that "while some Atlas-affiliated partners show readiness to confront the threat of nationalist and authoritarian societal mobilization, others conceive it as a tactical or strategic opportunity to advance free market causes." [ 46 ] Atlas Network was linked to an online campaign that used fake accounts against the Cuban government during the 2021 Cuban protests .

[ 47 ] Atlas Network sponsored the 2023 Latin America Liberty Forum in Brazil, where Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva 's policies were opposed.

[ 48 ] Atlas Network partners opposed the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine .

[ 46 ] Atlas Network worked with its partners to create the Ukraine Freedom Fund, acquiring, transporting, and providing goods to Ukrainians, [ 49 ] [ 50 ] and supporting Atlas Network partner groups in the country.

[ 46 ] The Washington Examiner reported that the humanitarian aid totaled $3.5 million by December 2022.

[ 50 ] According to Reason , Atlas Network supports nonprofit organizations that fight against authoritarianism and support free markets, self-determination, and rule of law.

[ 51 ] Leadership [ edit ] The chief executive officer of Atlas Network is Brad Lips. Lips joined Atlas Network, then known as the Atlas Economic Research Foundation, in 1998, [ 5 ] and became CEO in 2009.

[ 52 ] He is the author of Liberalism and the Free Society in 2021.

[ 53 ] He stated that he advocates for a "freedom philosophy", [ 54 ] and quoting Friedman, has summarized Atlas Network's function as "to develop alternatives to existing policies, to keep them alive until the politically impossible becomes the politically inevitable." [ 44 ] In an opinion article in The Chronicle of Philanthropy , Lips argued for funding market-oriented nonprofit groups instead of increasing traditional foreign aid .

[ 55 ] He said that Atlas Network is nonpartisan and "willing to talk to all parties".

[ 56 ] Matt Warner is the organization's president, while Tom Palmer serves as executive vice president for international programs.

[ 57 ] [ 58 ] Warner and Palmer co-authored the book Development with Dignity: Self-Determination, Localization, and the End of Poverty .

[ 59 ] Palmer, known in American libertarian circles since the 1970s, has promoted economic libertarian efforts in various countries including Communist and post-Communist Eastern Europe, as well as Iraq and Afghanistan ; after the 2022 Russian invasion , he traveled inside Ukraine to help coordinate Atlas Network aid.

[ 49 ] He has spoken out against far-right and far-left authoritarian populist movements in the United States and other countries.

[ 60 ] [ 61 ] Palmer blames "envy and resentment" for driving collectivist impulses that are authoritarian in nature.

[ 62 ] He also rejects Atlas Network’s "pro-corporate" label by some critics, saying that, "Being in favor of the market is not the same as being in favor of business." [ 63 ] Only 30 people work specifically for Atlas Network, although more than 1,000 people participate in it via its partner think tanks, according to Global Think Tanks: Policy Networks and Governance , published in 2020.

[ 64 ] Atlas Network is organized into centers by region.

[ 65 ] Entrepreneur Magatte Wade is director of the Center for African Prosperity and the historian Ibrahim B. Anoba is a fellow at the center. Wade said in Reason that the solution to Africa's economic problems lies in a "cheetah generation" of young Africans who embrace free markets, individualism, human rights, and transparency in government.

[ 66 ] In her words, "[Africa is] poor because we don't let our entrepreneurs work." [ 67 ] Antonella Marty of Argentina served as a fellow for the Center for Latin America, which publishes the annual Index of Bureaucracy.

[ 68 ] [ 69 ] Atlas Network also runs the Center for United States and Canada and the Center for Asia and Oceania.

Meanwhile, the Fraser Institute, the MLI, Second Street, the Canadian Taxpayers Federation, the Montreal Economics Institute, the Manhattan Institute, and the Cato Institute—whose materials are all repurposed as information subsidies or shared directly—are all members of the Atlas Network, the oil-industry-funded transnational network that supports market fundamentalist think tanks and whose members include a rogue's gallery of climate denying organizations (including America's Heartland Institute alongside the Fraser Institute). Atlas Network groups often interlock, with members moving from group to group throughout their careers.

Their vehicle is something called the Atlas Network, which at this writing claims over 400 affiliates in 95 countries, their operations partly funded by Koch and allied capitalists, with heavy support from fossil fuel-based fortunes ... The timing suggests one critical prompt. While the Atlas Network had been created a decade and a half earlier, its work notably escalated at this particular moment in the late 1990s. That was just as global recognition of climate change spread and parties across the spectrum began coordinating policies to address it, with the Kyoto Protocol adopted in 1997 being the prime example.
