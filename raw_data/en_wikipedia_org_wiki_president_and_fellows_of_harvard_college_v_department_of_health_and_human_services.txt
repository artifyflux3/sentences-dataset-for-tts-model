Background [ edit ] According to university president Alan Garber , funding for research at Harvard was affected by a federal grant pause imposed in January 2025. The pause was later halted by a court order.

[ 1 ] Garber later criticized funding cuts at the National Institute of Health that would reduce grants at Harvard Medical School .

[ 2 ] John Shaw, the vice provost for research, submitted a declaration with a lawsuit filed by thirteen universities, though Harvard did not join the lawsuit.

[ 3 ] In March, the Trump administration stated it would conduct a review of US$9 billion in federal funding to Harvard University .

[ 4 ] Lawsuit [ edit ] On April 21, 2025, the President and Fellows of Harvard College sued several Trump officials, including secretary of health and human services Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

, secretary of education Linda McMahon , acting administrator of the General Services Administration Stephen Ehikian , and attorney general Pam Bondi , as well as their agencies, in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts .
