It also relevant to law within the context of the postmodern era.  Since the mid-1990s Annual meetings of the Association of American Law Schools have focused on the inclusion of postmodern interpretative strategies at these meetings.

Critical practices connected to postmodern philosophy, such as critical literacy and deconstruction , can be used as an interpretative tool to ensure that a range of different and diverse values and norms are acknowledged or considered.
