Weibel at Oberwolfach in 2004 Charles Alexander Weibel (born October 28, 1950, in Terre Haute , Indiana ) is an American mathematician working on algebraic K-theory , algebraic geometry and homological algebra .

Weibel studied physics and mathematics at the University of Michigan , earning bachelor's degrees in both subjects in 1972. He was awarded a master's degree by the University of Chicago in 1973 and achieved his doctorate in 1977 under the supervision of Richard Swan ( Homotopy in Algebraic K-Theory ). From 1970 to 1976 he was an "Operations Research Analyst" at Standard Oil of Indiana, and from 1977 to 1978 was at the Institute for Advanced Study . In 1978 he became an assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania . In 1980 he became an assistant professor at Rutgers University , where he was promoted to professor in 1989.

He joined Vladimir Voevodsky and Markus Rost in proving the ( motivic ) Bloch–Kato conjecture (2009).

[ 1 ] It is a generalization of the Milnor conjecture of algebraic K-theory, which was proved by Voevodsky in the 1990s. He was a visiting professor in 1992 at the University of Paris and 1993 at the University of Strasbourg . Since 1983 he has been an editor of the Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra .
He helped found the K-theory Foundation in 2010, and has been a managing editor of the Annals of K-theory since 2014.
In 2014, he became a Fellow of the American Mathematical Society .
