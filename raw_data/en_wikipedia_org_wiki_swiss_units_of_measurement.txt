Metric system was optional in 1868, and has been compulsory since 1877.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] System before metric system [ edit ] Units were varied and were not in fixed values.  During the transition to the metric system, units were fixed.

[ 1 ] Before 1856, almost every canton had its own system of units.

[ 3 ] Length [ edit ] A number of units were used to measure length.  One pied (1 fuss) was equal to 0.30 m, according to the fixed value defined during the transition to the metric system.

[ 1 ] [ 4 ] Some other units and their fixed values are given below: 1 ligne = 1/144 pied 1 linie = 1/144 pied 1 pouce = 1/12 pied 1 zoll = 1/12 pied 1 aune = 2 pied (or 4 pied [ 3 ] ) 1 elle = 2 pied 1 brache = 2 pied [ 3 ] 1 toise = 6 pied 1 ruthe = 6 pied 1 perche = 16 pied (or 10 pied [ 3 ] ) 1 lieue = 16 000 pied.

[ 1 ] [ 4 ] Lieue was used as a road measure.

[ 3 ] Area [ edit ] One arpent was 400 pied 2 or 1.44 ha Mass [ edit ] A number of units were used to measure mass.

Ordinary [ edit ] One livre (pfund of the Zollverein) was equal to 0.500 kg according to the fixed value defined during the transition to the metric system.

[ 1 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Some other units and their fixed values are given below: 1 loth = 1/32 livre [ 1 ] [ 4 ] 1 once = 1/16 livre [ 1 ] [ 4 ] 1 quintal = 100 livre.

[ 3 ] Medicine (apothecary or pharmacy) [ edit ] One livre was equal to 0.375 kg according to the fixed value defined during the transition to the metric system.

[ 1 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Some other units and their fixed values are given below: 1 grain = 1/5760 livre 1 scruple = 1/288 livre 1 drachme = 1/96 livre 1 once = 1/12 livre.

[ 1 ] [ 4 ] Capacity [ edit ] Two main systems, dry and liquid, were used.

Dry [ edit ] Several units were used to measure dry capacity.  Some units are given below: 1 quarteron (divided into 1/4 and 1/16) = 10  emine =  15 L (0.4257 bushel) 1 double quarteron = 2 quarteron 1 sac = 10 quarteron.

[ 3 ] Quarteron is the volume of 30 livre of pure water at 4 °C.

[ 3 ] Quarteron was equal to 5/9 of a cubic pied.

[ 3 ] Liquid [ edit ] Several units were used to measure dry capacity.  Some units are given below: 1 setier = 25 pot 1 muid = 4 setiers 1 pot = 1.5 L (1.585 quarts).

[ 3 ] Pot was the bulk of 3 livres weight of pure water at the temperature of 4 °C. Pot was equal to 1/18 pied 3 and was subdivided into 1/2, 1/4 and 1/8.
