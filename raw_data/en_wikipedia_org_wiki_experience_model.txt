Find sources: "Experience model" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( September 2023 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) An experience model is a description of the key attributes that drive end-user experience when interacting with a system, product, or service.

[ 1 ] These attributes may be a combination of end-user attributes and those of the system or environment. These attributes are typically uncovered as insights exposed through behavioral research. Experience models are typically visually represented by abstract diagrams or visualizations to enhance understanding of the attributes and how they influence experience and engagement. The value of an experience model is to help designers focus on solution options that are most likely to improve end-user experience outcomes.
