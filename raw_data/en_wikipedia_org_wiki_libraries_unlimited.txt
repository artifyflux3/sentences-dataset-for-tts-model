Since 2021, ABC-Clio and its suite of imprints are collectively imprints of British publishing house Bloomsbury Publishing .

ABC-Clio provides service to fifteen different online databases which contain over one million online textbooks.

[ 2 ] The company consults academic leaders in the fields they cover in order to provide authority for their reference titles.

[ 3 ] The headquarters are located in Santa Barbara, California .

History [ edit ] ABC-Clio was founded in 1955 as a privately held corporation by Eric Boehm with its first publication, Historical Abstracts .

[ 4 ] The name represents the company's two original divisions when it incorporated in 1969: ABC stands for American Bibliographical Center and Clio Press is named after Clio , the muse of history from ancient Greek mythology . According to Boehm, he had always been interested in history so when he noticed that there were not many good historical abstracting services available, he started publishing the Historical Abstracts .

[ 5 ] During the 1960s, a sister bibliographic and abstract publication on American history was added, America: History and Life , which was considered an award-winning title. The company entered into digital publishing with electronic data in the 1960s and in 1975, it published its first online database [ 6 ] called DIALOG . During the 1980s, ABC-Clio expanded into providing primary reference books such as encyclopedias and dictionaries and stopped publishing bibliographic books.

[ 5 ] In the 1990s, ABC-Clio began to provide access to its humanities database on CD-ROM . The Exegy Current Events CD-ROM was named "Best Disc of the Year" by Library Journal .

[ 4 ] In 1998, ABC-Clio provided electronic access to America: History and Life . By the 2000s, one of the company's most popular products had become online databases for researching many topics in the field of the humanities. In 2001, ABC-Clio began to publish eBooks , initially providing 150 different titles to schools and libraries.

[ 6 ] The company's reference books had won numerous awards, and the company started a series of subject-related online databases for secondary school use. In 2004, the company acquired the quarterly historical journal, Journal of the West , which has been published since 1962.

[ 4 ] In 1996, ABC-Clio merged with an electronic publishing company, Intellimation, which also produced educational software. The merger brought Becky Snyder, who by 2009 had become ABC-Clio's president, from Intellimation.

[ 7 ] In 2007, it sold two databases – Historical Abstracts and America: History and Life – to EBSCO Publishing ; in addition, the companies also agreed a partnership through which nine additional ABC-Clio databases would be distributed through EBSCO Publishing.

[ 8 ] In December 2021, Bloomsbury Publishing acquired ABC-Clio for US$ 22.9 million (equivalent to $25.4 million in 2023).

[ 9 ] Subsidiaries [ edit ] Intellimation Linworth Publishing, Inc.: On March 18, 2009, Libraries Unlimited announced the acquisition of Linworth Publishing, with partnership becoming effective immediately.

[ 10 ] Journal of the West Imprints and series [ edit ] ABC-Clio/Greenwood [ edit ] Main article: Greenwood Publishing Group In 2008, ABC-Clio acquired the Greenwood Publishing Group from Houghton Mifflin Harcourt . The deal gave ABC-Clio a "perpetual license" to use the imprints of Greenwood Press and publish all of its titles. Acquiring the publishing group gave ABC-Clio access to Greenwood Press, Praeger Publishers, Praeger Security International, and Libraries Unlimited.

[ 11 ] Greenwood focuses on publishing full-text reference works which are authoritative on various topics.

[ 12 ] Libraries Unlimited [ edit ] Libraries Unlimited came to ABC-Clio as part of a deal with Greenwood Press. In 2012, Kathyrn Suárez was named publisher for this division, which focuses on publishing for librarians and information professionals.

[ 12 ] ABC-Clio Solutions [ edit ] ABC-Clio databases are provided under the umbrella of ABC-Clio Solutions. There are fifteen different databases providing access to different subject areas.

[ 2 ] ABC-Clio Solutions provides digital curriculum with multimedia content, text-to-speech features, translation tools which covers various topics relating to history and the humanities.

[ 13 ] After ABC-Clio acquired Greenwood Press's databases, they revamped the look and feel of their interface in order to provide common access through the ABC-Clio interface.

[ 14 ] ABC-Clio also provided the ability to search across multiple databases through one search, also providing options for narrowing the search after revamping their interface.

[ 15 ] The new interface is considered user-friendly and provides access to personalized features.

[ 16 ] Praeger Publishing [ edit ] In 1950, American Frederick A. Praeger founded Frederick A. Praeger, Inc.

[ 17 ] Originally publishing books by disillusioned former Communists who had fled from behind the Iron Curtain , the publishing house became known for publishing "scholarly and professional books" in the subject areas of social sciences and the humanities.

[ 12 ] In 1966, Praeger sold his firm to William B. Benton , an American senator and publisher and the chairman of Encyclopaedia Britannica .

[ 17 ] In 1976, it was sold to CBS , [ 18 ] which had shortened the name to Praeger Publishing before selling it to Greenwood Press, Inc.

, in 1986.

[ 18 ] When the renamed Greenwood Publishing Group (GPG) was acquired by ABC-Clio in 2009, [ 19 ] Praeger Publishing became a standalone imprint of ABC-Clio, and remained such when, in December 2021, Bloomsbury Publishing bought ABC-Clio.
