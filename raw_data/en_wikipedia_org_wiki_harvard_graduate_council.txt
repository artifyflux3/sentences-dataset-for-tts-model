One Harvard.

Institution Harvard University Location Cambridge , Massachusetts President Dalton Fogarty Website hgc .harvard .edu The Harvard Graduate Council ( HGC ) (formerly known as the HGSG and originally founded as the HGC ) is the centralized student government organization for the twelve graduate schools of Harvard University . Representing the interests of more than 15,000 Harvard graduate students, HGC is responsible for advocating student concerns to the University administrators, including the President of Harvard University , as well as the Provost and the Deans. HGC is also tasked with organizing large university-wide initiatives and events, managing and providing funding for university-wide student groups (USGs), [ 1 ] [ 2 ] as well as representing the Harvard graduate student population during conferences with other Ivy League universities and external organizations.

[ 3 ] In addition, HGC collaborates with its undergraduate counterpart, the Harvard Undergraduate Council (UC). The HGC Seal is formed by 13 different Harvard seals. At the center is the main Harvard University seal, which itself is surrounded by the 12 smaller seals of individual graduate schools.

HGC is a steward of the "One Harvard" movement, which aims to bring all of Harvard's graduate schools together through joint advocacy, closer collaboration, and social interaction. Through this movement, HGC organizes university-wide initiatives and events, administers funding for university-wide student groups (USGs), and represents the Harvard graduate student population in relation with other universities and external organizations. HGC is a federal-like student government organization: it consists of representatives from all 12 graduate schools, but each of the twelve schools continues to operate some type of a local student council of its own. These local student councils focus on school-specific issues, whereas HGC's mandate extends to the entire university.
