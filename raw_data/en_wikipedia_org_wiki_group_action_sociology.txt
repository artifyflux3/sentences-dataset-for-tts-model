Group action will often take place when social agents realize they are more likely to achieve their goal when acting together rather than individually. Group action differs from group behaviours , which are uncoordinated, and also from mass actions , which are more limited in place.

Group action is more likely to occur when the individuals within the group feel a sense of unity with the group , even in personally costly actions.
