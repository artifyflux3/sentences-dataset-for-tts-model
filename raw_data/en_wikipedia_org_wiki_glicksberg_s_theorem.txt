( May 2025 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) In the study of zero sum games , Glicksberg's theorem (also Glicksberg's existence theorem ) is a result that shows certain games have a minimax value.

[ 1 ] If A and B are Hausdorff compact spaces , and K is an upper semicontinuous or lower semicontinuous function on A × × B {\displaystyle A\times B} , then sup f inf g ∬ ∬ K d f d g = inf g sup f ∬ ∬ K d f d g {\displaystyle \sup _{f}\inf _{g}\iint K\,df\,dg=\inf _{g}\sup _{f}\iint K\,df\,dg} where f and g run over Borel probability measures on A and B .

The theorem is useful if f and g are interpreted as mixed strategies of two players in the context of a continuous game .  If the payoff function K is upper semicontinuous, then the game has a value.

The continuity condition may not be dropped: see example of a game with no value .
