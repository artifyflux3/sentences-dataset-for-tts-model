A T and O map or O–T or T–O map ( orbis terrarum , orb or circle of the lands; with the letter T inside an O), also known as an Isidoran map , is a type of early world map that represents the Afro-Eurasian landmass as a circle (= O) divided into three parts by a T-shaped combination of the Mediterranean sea, the river Tanais (Don) and the Nile.

[ 1 ] The origins of this diagram are contested, with some scholars hypothesizing an origin in Roman or late antiquity, while others consider it to have originated in 7th or early-8th century Spain.

[ 2 ] The earliest surviving example of a T-O map is found in a late-7th or early-8th century copy of Isidore of Seville's (c. 560–636) De natura rerum , which alongside his Etymologiae (c. 625) are two of the most common texts to be accompanied by such a diagram in the Middle Ages.

[ 3 ] A later manuscript added the names of Noah's sons ( Sem , Iafeth and Cham ) for each of the three continents (see Biblical terminology for race ).

[ 4 ] A later variation with more detail is the Beatus map drawn by Beatus of Liébana , an 8th-century Spanish monk , in the prologue to his Commentary on the Apocalypse .

Relevant textual descriptions of the world [ edit ] The earliest T-O maps are closely associated with two sections of the work of Isidore of Seville: De Natura Rerum 48.2-3 (drawn verbatim from Hyginus' De astronomia 1.9(8) and Augustine of Hippo's City of God 16.17 [ 5 ] ): So the earth may be divided into three sides (trifarie), of which one part is Europe , another Asia , and the third is called Africa . Europe is divided from Africa by a sea from the end of the ocean and the Pillars of Hercules . And Asia is divided from Libya with Egypt by the Nile ... Moreover, Asia – as the most blessed Augustine said – runs from the southeast to the north ... Thus we see the earth is divided into two to comprise, on the one hand, Europe and Africa, and on the other only Asia.

[ 6 ] Etymologiae 14.2.1: The world is called round after the roundness of a circle, because it is like a wheel [...] Because of this, the Ocean flowing around it is contained in a circular limit, and it is divided in three parts, one part being called Asia, the second Europe, and the third Africa.

[ 7 ] History and description [ edit ] Spherical Earth concept [ edit ] Although Isidore taught in the Etymologiae that the Earth was "round", his meaning was ambiguous and some writers think he referred to a disc-shaped Earth. However, other writings by Isidore make it clear that he considered the Earth to be spherical .

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] Indeed, the spherical Earth had been the prevailing scholarly assumption since at least Aristotle , who had delineated a frigid clime at the poles , a torrid clime near the equator , and a habitable temperate clime in between.

Ideal reconstruction of medieval world maps (from Meyers Konversationslexikon , 1895) A "T-O" map made with modern cartography The T and O map represents only half of the spherical Earth, [ 10 ] presumably a convenient projection of the known northern temperate region. It was believed that no one could cross the torrid equatorial clime and reach the unknown lands to the south, the antipodes .

[ 10 ] [ 11 ] Boundaries, center and orientation [ edit ] The T is the Mediterranean , the Nile , and the Don (formerly called the Tanais) dividing the three continents , Asia , Europe and Africa , and the O is the encircling ocean .

[ 12 ] In line with Isidore's description, Asia is normally depicted as equal in size to Africa and Europe combined.

[ 13 ] The majority T-O maps are oriented to the east, though examples of north, south and westward orientation can also be found.

[ 14 ] The idea that Jerusalem was generally represented in the center of the map as the navel of the world, the umbilicus mundi , is a false generalisation from a relatively small number of very famous 13th-century mappae mundi .

[ 15 ] The earliest T-O maps marked no particular geographic center and while some early mappae mundi were specifically centered on classical sites like Delos or the Cyclades, most simply had the Mediterranean or Aegean Sea in the middle.

[ 16 ] It was only after the First Crusade that Jerusalem began to be represented as the center of the world on medieval maps, a trend which rose to prominence from the mid-12th century through the early-14th century, but was never universally observed.

[ 17 ] The location of Paradise (the Garden of Eden) in the east of Asia is based upon the Septuagint translation of Genesis 2:8, which describes the garden of Eden being planted in the east. This is a longstanding feature of Christian textual geographies, and while not present on the earliest T-O maps, it is a prominent feature of many early mappae mundi , especially the Beatus maps .

[ 18 ] These depictions are often combined with a depiction of the four rivers of Paradise: the Tigris, Euphrates, Pishon and Gihon, the latter two of which were sometimes understood by medieval cartographers as the Ganges and Nile (or Geon) respectively. These were either depicted as flowing within/out from paradise and/or as four major rivers on the map.

[ 19 ] Additional details [ edit ] This qualitative and conceptual type of medieval cartography could yield extremely detailed maps in addition to simple representations. The earliest maps had only a few cities and the most important bodies of water noted.

[ dubious – discuss ] [ citation needed ] Different cartographic material, which represented more useful tools for the traveler, were the itinerarium , which listed in order the names of towns between two points, and the periplus that did the same for harbors and landmarks along a seacoast.

[ citation needed ] Later maps of the T-and-O conceptual format featured many rivers and cities of Eastern as well as Western Europe , and other features encountered during the Crusades . Decorative illustrations were also added in addition to the new geographic features.  The most important cities would be represented by sketches of fortifications and towers in addition to their names, and the empty spaces would be filled with mythical creatures.

^ Williams 1997 , p. 13: "...the Isidoran tradition, as it was known from peninsular examples, including the earliest of the ubiquitous T-O maps. This emblematic figure appears twice at the foot of folio 24v in a copy of Isidore's De Natura Rerum, now Escorial R.II.18. [...] When, in the ninth century, the Escorial manuscript fell into the hands of Eulogius and was supplemented, this precise text (Etymologiae XIV, 2, 3) was placed on the page, folio 25r, facing the primitive map and was introduced another small T-O map. To this later T-O diagram, however, were added the names of Noah's sons- Shem, Japheth and Ham, for Asia, Europe and Africa, respectively-outside the circle of the globe. This apportionment is only implicit in the Bible (Genesis 9: 18-19). Josephus (d. c.100 AD) is more explicit as was Hippolytus of Rome, whose chronicle of 234 in its Latin translation disseminated the Noachid distribution in the West. Isidore's Etymologiae, however, the distribution of Noah's sons is not highlighted, but only incidentally reported with the description of the location of cities in Book IX. It seems clear, if we accept the evidence of Escorial R.II.18, that the Shem-Japheth-Ham distribution was not in the primitive Isidoran diagram. This means that Isidore's use of the T-O diagram was not informed by any overt religious content." ^ Isidore of Seville: On the Nature of Things , trans. Calvin B.

^ Mauntel, "The T-O Diagram and its Religious Connotations", 59. A small number of T-O maps instead depict Africa as taking up half the circle as opposed to Asia (Woodward, "Medieval Mappaemundi ", 343.) and a smaller number still depict Europe in this way (e.g. Ingrid Baumgärtner, "Die Wahrnehmung Jerusalems auf mittelalterlichen Weltkarten", in Jerusalem: im Hoch- und Spätmittelalter: Konflikte und Konfliktbewältigung - Vorstellungen und Vergegenwärtigungen , ed. Dieter R. Bauer, Klaus Herbers and Nikolas Jaspert (Frankfurt am Main: Campus Verlag, 2001), 271-73).

^ Non-eastern orientations are associated above all with T-O maps that accompany Sallust's Jugurthine War , on which see Woodward, "Medieval Mappaemundi ", 343-4, where examples of all four orientations are also provided. There is no consensus on the origins of the predominantly eastern orientation, some like Mauntel, "The T-O Diagram and its Religious Connotations", 65-9 argue that it is a specifically Christian development, while others like Patrick Gautier Dalché, "L'héritage antique de la cartographie médiévale: Les problèmes et les acquis", in Cartography in Antiquity and the Middle Ages: Fresh Perspectives, New Methods , ed. Richard J. A. Talbert and Richard W. Unger (Leiden: Brill, 2008), 55-6 are more circumspect about the specifically Christian significance of this orientation.
