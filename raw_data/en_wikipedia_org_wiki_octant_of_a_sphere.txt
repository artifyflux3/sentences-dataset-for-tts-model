It is sometimes called a trirectangular (spherical) triangle .

[ 1 ] It is one face of a spherical octahedron .

[ 2 ] For a sphere embedded in three-dimensional Euclidean space , the vectors from the sphere's center to each vertex of an octant are the basis vectors of a Cartesian coordinate system relative to which the sphere is a unit sphere . The spherical octant itself is the intersection of the sphere with one octant of space .

Uniquely among spherical triangles, the octant is its own polar triangle .

[ 3 ] The octant can be parametrized using a rational quartic Bézier triangle .

[ 4 ] The solid angle subtended by a spherical octant is π /2 steradian or one-eight of a spat , the solid angle of a full sphere.
