[ 1 ] Life [ edit ] He was the son of Richard Synge and Alice Rowley, daughter of Richard Rowley. A native of Bridgnorth , [ 2 ] he was educated at Balliol College, Oxford .

[ 3 ] He came to Ireland as Chaplain to Christopher Hampton , Archbishop of Armagh and Vicar general of Armagh . Hampton thought very highly of him and recommended him for preferment, despite Synge's incurring the enmity of the formidable William Laud , with whom he clashed on the issue of private confession . He held incumbencies at Donoughmore , Loughgilly and Killary . He was appointed Treasurer of Dromore Cathedral in 1834; [ 4 ] and Dean in 1635, a post he held until his elevation to the episcopate in 1638.

[ 5 ] On the outbreak of the Irish Rebellion of 1641 , he fled for safety to Dublin. Tragedy struck the same year when several of his family perished in a shipwreck . He was sworn a member of the Privy Council of Ireland in 1644. In 1647  he was nominated as Archbishop of Tuam , but due to the state of civil war in Ireland, he was unable to gain possession of the Archdiocese. He retired to Bridgnorth and died there.

[ citation needed ] Family [ edit ] He married firstly Anne Edgeworth, daughter of Francis Edgeworth of Dublin, Clerk of the Crown and Hanaper , and niece of Edward Edgeworth , Bishop of Down and Connor . He married secondly Elizabeth Stephens, and had issue by both marriages, including Margaret (died 1641), who married Michael Boyle , Archbishop of Armagh . His younger brother Edward Synge was like George a bishop, as were his son and grandson, both also named Edward.
