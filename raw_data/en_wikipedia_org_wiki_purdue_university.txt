[ 7 ] The university was founded in 1869 after Lafayette businessman John Purdue donated land and money to establish a college of science, technology, and agriculture; [ 8 ] the first classes were held on September 16, 1874.

[ 8 ] Purdue University is a member of the Association of American Universities and is classified among "R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity".

[ 9 ] Purdue enrolls the largest student body of any individual university campus in Indiana, as well as the ninth-largest foreign student population of any university in the United States.

[ 10 ] The university is home to the oldest computer science program and the first university-owned airport in the United States.

Purdue is the founding member of the Big Ten Conference and sponsors 18 intercollegiate sports teams. It has been affiliated with 13 Nobel laureates , 1 Turing Award laureate, 1 Bharat Ratna recipient, [ a ] 27 astronauts , [ 11 ] 2 World Food Prize laureates, 3 Pulitzer Prize winners, 18 Olympic medalists, 3 National Medal of Technology and Innovation recipients, 2 National Medal of Science recipients, 3 Presidential Medal of Freedom recipients, 7 members of Congress , 3 U.S. governors , and 2 heads of state.

[ 12 ] [ 13 ] History [ edit ] John Purdue , the university's eponymous benefactor In 1865, the Indiana General Assembly voted to take advantage of the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act of 1862 and began plans to establish an institution with a focus on agriculture and engineering with the preliminary name of the Indiana Agricultural College.

[ 14 ] Communities throughout the state offered facilities and funding in bids for the location of the new college. Popular proposals included designating Indiana University or what is now Butler University as Indiana's land-grant, as well as the addition of an agriculture department at what is now Indiana State University . By 1869, Tippecanoe County 's offer included $150,000 (equivalent to $3.5 million in 2024) from Lafayette business leader and philanthropist John Purdue ; $50,000 from the county; and 100 acres (0.4 km 2 ) of land from John Purdue and local residents.

[ 15 ] On May 6, 1869, the General Assembly established the institution in Tippecanoe County as Purdue University, in the name of the principal benefactor. Classes began at Purdue on September 16, 1874, with six instructors and 39 students.

[ 8 ] Professor John S. Hougham was Purdue's first faculty member and served as acting president between the administrations of presidents Shortridge and White.

[ 8 ] [ 16 ] A campus of five buildings was completed by the end of 1874.

[ 17 ] In 1875, Sarah D. Allen Oren Haynes , the State Librarian of Indiana, was appointed professor of botany.

[ 18 ] Purdue issued its first degree, a Bachelor of Science in chemistry, in 1875. The first female student was admitted that autumn.

[ 19 ] [ 20 ] Emerson E. White , the university's president from 1876 to 1883, followed a strict interpretation of the Morrill Act. Rather than emulate the classical universities, White believed Purdue should be an "industrial college" and devote its resources toward providing a broad, liberal education with an emphasis on science, technology, and agriculture.

[ 21 ] Part of White's plan to distinguish Purdue from classical universities included a controversial attempt to ban fraternities, which was ultimately overturned by the Indiana Supreme Court . White resigned in protest.

[ 22 ] The next president, James H. Smart , is remembered for his call in 1894 to rebuild the original Heavilon Hall "one brick higher" after it had been destroyed by a fire.

[ 23 ] By the end of the nineteenth century, the university was organized into schools of agriculture, engineering (mechanical, civil, and electrical), and pharmacy; former U.S. President Benjamin Harrison served on the board of trustees .

[ 24 ] Purdue's engineering laboratories included testing facilities for a locomotive, and for a Corliss steam engine —one of the most efficient engines of the time. Programs in education and home economics were soon established, as well as a short-lived school of medicine . By 1925, Purdue had the largest undergraduate engineering enrollment in the country, a status it would keep for half a century.

[ 25 ] Purdue University, 1904 President Edward C. Elliott oversaw a campus building program between the world wars. Inventor, alumnus, and trustee David E. Ross coordinated several fundraisers, donated lands to the university, and was instrumental in establishing the Purdue Research Foundation. Ross's gifts and fundraisers supported such projects as Ross–Ade Stadium , the Memorial Union , a civil engineering surveying camp, and Purdue University Airport . Purdue Airport was the country's first university-owned airport and the site of the country's first college-credit flight training courses.

[ 26 ] Amelia Earhart joined the Purdue faculty in 1935 as a consultant for these flight courses and as a counselor on women's careers. In 1936, the Purdue Research Foundation provided the funds for the Lockheed Electra 10-E Earhart flew on her attempted round-the-world flight.

[ 27 ] University Hall Every school and department at the university was involved in some type of military research or training during World War II .

[ 28 ] During a project on radar receivers, Purdue physicists discovered properties of germanium that led to the making of the first transistor .

[ 29 ] [ 30 ] The Army and the Navy conducted training programs at Purdue and more than 17,500 students, staff, and alumni served in the armed forces.

[ 31 ] Purdue set up about a hundred centers throughout Indiana to train skilled workers for defense industries.

[ 32 ] As veterans returned to the university under the G.I. Bill , first-year classes were taught at some of these sites to alleviate the demand for campus space. Four of these sites are now degree-granting regional campuses of the Purdue University system . On-campus housing became racially desegregated in 1947.

[ 33 ] [ 34 ] After the war, a decade-long construction program emphasized science and research. In the late 1950s and early 1960s the university established programs in veterinary medicine, industrial management, and nursing, as well as the first computer science department in the United States.

[ 35 ] Undergraduate humanities courses were strengthened, graduate-level study in these areas were slowly established. Purdue awarded its first Bachelor of Arts degrees in 1960.

[ 36 ] The official seal of Purdue was officially inaugurated during the university's centennial in 1969. Consisting of elements from emblems that had been used unofficially since the 1890s, the current seal depicts a griffin , symbolizing strength, and a three-part shield, representing education, research, and service.

[ 37 ] In 1975, Purdue University joined ARPANET , an early packet-switching network that would ultimately become the foundation for the modern internet.

[ 38 ] In recent years, Purdue's leaders have continued to support high-tech research and international programs. In 1987, U.S. President Ronald Reagan visited the West Lafayette campus to give a speech about the influence of technological progress on job creation.

[ 39 ] In the 1990s, the university added more opportunities to study abroad and expanded its course offerings in world languages and cultures.

[ 40 ] The first buildings of the Discovery Park interdisciplinary research center were dedicated in 2004.

[ 41 ] On April 27, 2017, Purdue University announced plans to acquire for-profit college Kaplan University and convert it to a public university in the state of Indiana, subject to multiple levels of approval.

[ 42 ] That school now operates as Purdue University Global , and aims to serve adult learners.

[ 43 ] On July 1, 2024, Purdue launched Purdue University in Indianapolis , an extension of the West Lafayette campus, after the formal split of Indiana University–Purdue University Indianapolis . It conveys Purdue West Lafayette degrees and has the same academic rigor as the flagship campus. Purdue currently has a 28-acre (11 ha) footprint in downtown Indianapolis that includes space in the existing engineering and technology buildings, and has established partnerships with companies for facilities and shared spaces throughout the metro area .

[ 44 ] Integration [ edit ] Purdue had black graduates by the 1890s, and in 1905 a Black man ran for its track team. But some time in the 1910s the teams became segregated, and remained so until a student protest in 1947. Black students were not allowed to live in the residence halls until the 1940s. Black males were able to live in cooperatives, but Black females were not allowed to live anywhere in West Lafayette. In 1946, the women's dormitories were integrated by an order of the governor of Indiana.

[ 45 ] [ 46 ] Helen Williams became the first Black faculty member in 1968.

[ 47 ] Trump era [ edit ] In 2025, in response to state-level executive orders aligning with directives issued by President Donald Trump , the university terminated its Office of Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging, saying that staff who had been a part of that office would have the chance to interview for current vacancies in other areas. The university also terminated the Recruitment and Diversity Office for the Polytechnic Institute, despite diversity only being a small part of the office's function. Terminated staff members believed that it was because of the name alone that the office was terminated, as other recruitment offices for different parts of the university that did not have "diversity" in the name had remained untouched.

[ 48 ] [ 49 ] [ 50 ] In June of that year, the Indiana General Assembly passed a state budget bill mandating that Indiana's public universities phase out programs that produce fewer than a certain number of graduates over a three-year period. As a result, Purdue eliminated or merged a number of master's and Ph.D. programs in areas such as microbiology, mathematics, and literature.

[ 51 ] Campuses [ edit ] Purdue's campus is situated in the small city of West Lafayette , near the western bank of the Wabash River , across which sits the larger city of Lafayette . Mitch Daniels Boulevard (formerly State Street) divides the northern and southern portions of campus. Academic buildings are mostly concentrated on the eastern and southern parts of campus, with residence halls and intramural fields to the west, and athletic facilities to the north. An extensive system of underground tunnels protects pedestrians from snow, ice, wind, rain and UV during movements between buildings.

[ 52 ] Purdue Mall [ edit ] Purdue Mall, showing the Engineering Fountain , Purdue Bell Tower , and Hovde Hall The Purdue Mall is the central quad of Purdue University and was created to connect the academic campus with Ross-Ade Stadium. It is also known as the Engineering Mall due to its proximity to several engineering buildings. The most prominent feature of the Purdue Mall is the 38-foot (12 m)-tall concrete Engineering Fountain .

The Purdue Bell Tower is between the Stadium and Centennial Malls. The Bell Tower is considered an icon of the university and can be found on many Purdue logos and those of the cities of Lafayette and West Lafayette .

[ 53 ] Southwest of the Stadium Mall is the Edward C. Elliott Hall of Music , one of the largest proscenium theaters in the world.

[ 54 ] Elliott Hall of Music serves as the home of the WBAA (AM) and WBAA-FM studios, and was the base of operations for Purdue Bands and Orchestras until the completion of the Marc and Sharon Hagle Hall in 2022.

[ 55 ] West of the Elliott Hall of Music is the Armory Building. The Armory Building was rebuilt in 1918 after a fire and houses the university's ROTC programs and other clubs.

[ 56 ] Memorial Mall [ edit ] Purdue Memorial Union Union Club The Purdue Memorial Mall, south of the Purdue Mall, is the original section of campus. It is a popular meeting place for students and is surrounded by other buildings used for academic and cultural purposes.

[ 57 ] [ 58 ] [ 59 ] Near this section of campus is Felix Haas Hall, which was constructed in 1909 as Memorial Gymnasium in memory of the 17 Purdue University football players, coaches, alumni, and fans who died in the Purdue Wreck railroad accident of 1903. The structure was renovated in 1985 to house the computer science department . In 2006, it was renamed in honor of retired Provost Felix Haas and began to also house the Statistics department.

[ 60 ] East of the Memorial Mall is the Purdue Memorial Union , Purdue's student union building, and the adjacent Union Club Hotel.

[ 61 ] [ 62 ] University Hall [ edit ] University Hall is the only building remaining from the original six-building campus. Construction began in 1871, when the building was known as "The Main Building". The building was dedicated in 1877. University Hall originally housed the office of the president, a chapel, and classrooms. At the request of John Purdue , he was buried in the Memorial Mall, directly across from the main entrance of University Hall.

[ 63 ] [ 64 ] South Campus [ edit ] The area south of Mitch Daniels Boulevard is home to Purdue's agricultural, fine arts, life sciences, and veterinary buildings. This area also includes the Krannert School of Management, Horticulture Gardens , Discovery Park , Lyles Porter Hall and the Purdue Airport .

Lyles Porter Hall houses interdisciplinary healthcare facilities and classroom space within the College of Health and Human Sciences as well as the West Lafayette branch of the Indiana University School of Medicine .

[ 65 ] West Campus [ edit ] The western portion of campus consists of student housing, dining, and recreation facilities. The Córdova Recreational Sports Center, built in 1957, is the first building in the nation created solely to serve university student recreational needs.

[ 66 ] [ 67 ] Stadium Avenue [ edit ] Mackey Arena Slayter Center of Performing Arts Cary Quadrangle Much of the northern part of campus sits on land purchased for the university by industrialist David E. Ross and author George Ade in the 1920s. Many of Purdue's athletic facilities are there, including Ross–Ade Stadium ( American football ), Mackey Arena (basketball), and Lambert Fieldhouse (indoor track and field). This area also includes the Slayter Center of Performing Arts and Cary Quadrangle, one of the largest all-male housing units in the country.

[ 162 ] From 1889 to 2008 Purdue published a yearbook called the Debris .

[ 163 ] WBAA are radio station operations owned by and licensed to Metropolitan Indianapolis Public Media , with studios at the university, featuring three noncommercial stations: WBAA News, WBAA Classical, and WBAA Jazz. The stations can be heard on AM 920, 101.3 FM, and 105.9 FM. WBAA also broadcasts on HD Radio and digital platforms including wbaa.org and the WBAA app. Its studios are in the Edward C. Elliott Hall of Music on the Purdue campus, and the transmitters are in Lafayette, Indiana . WBAA is the longest continuously operating radio station in Indiana, having been licensed on April 4, 1922. WBAA is a NPR member station. Despite some public disapproval, in 2022, Purdue sold WBAA (AM) and WBAA-FM to WFYI-FM .

[ 164 ] Purdue received $700,000 in underwriting credit while agreeing to provide an investment of $250,000 annually for two years to WFYI to offset initial operating costs.

[ 165 ] There are also a few campus radio stations on campus. Currently, three radio stations operate from residence halls , broadcasting via internet only; WCCR from Cary Quadrangle (not to be confused with the current WCCR FM or WCCR-LP stations in other states), WILY from Wiley Hall, and WHHR from Harrison Hall.

W9YB actively participates in emergency management for the Tippecanoe County area and maintains ready status with its members in skills to assist. W9YB is among the longest standing amateur radio clubs in the United States, with the current callsign dating back to 1932 and the previous callsign 9YB dating back to 1920.

[ 170 ] The Movie Tribute Show was created in a small television studio (now known as the Erik Mygrant Studio) on campus in 1999.

[ 171 ] Athletics [ edit ] Main article: Purdue Boilermakers Purdue's mascots, the Boilermaker Special and Purdue Pete On October 26, 1891, a newspaper in Crawfordsville, Indiana called Purdue's football team the "Boiler Makers" when writing about their trouncing of Wabash College . Lafayette newspapers soon picked up the name, and in October 1892, The Purdue Exponent , Purdue's student newspaper, gave it the stamp of approval.

[ 172 ] In the early days of Purdue football, the team was called other names as well, including "haymakers", "railsplitters", "sluggers", and "cornfield sailors". This heritage is reflected in Purdue's official mascot: the Boilermaker Special (a truck-like vehicle that resembles a locomotive) and the athletic mascot Purdue Pete (a muscular hammer-wielding boilermaker ). The school colors of old gold and black were selected by Purdue's first football team in 1887 to resemble the orange and black of Princeton's then-successful team.

[ 173 ] This made Purdue football the first sports team to ever use a black and gold color palette. The best known fight song is " Hail Purdue!

".

Purdue has one of the few college athletic programs not funded by student fees or subsidized by the university.

[ 174 ] [ 175 ] It is home to 18 Division I/I-A NCAA teams including football, basketball, cross country, tennis, wrestling, golf, volleyball, ice hockey ( ACHA ), and others. Purdue is a founding member of the Big Ten Conference , and played a central role in its creation. Traditional rivals include Big Ten colleagues the Indiana Hoosiers (see Indiana–Purdue rivalry ), the Illinois Fighting Illini , and the Notre Dame Fighting Irish from the Atlantic Coast Conference (football program independent, however).

[ 176 ] [ 177 ] Purdue's baseball facility was named in honor of two alumni, Anna Margaret Ross Alexander and her husband, John Arthur Alexander, when the new stadium was dedicated in 2013.

[ 178 ] Football [ edit ] The Boilermaker football team represents Purdue University in the NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS). Purdue plays its home games at Ross-Ade Stadium on the university's campus. The Boilermakers compete in the Big Ten Conference as a member of the West Division.

Found on a farm in southern Indiana , the Old Oaken Bucket is one of the oldest American football trophies. The winner of Purdue's annual game against the Indiana University Hoosiers gets to keep the trophy until the next face-off and add a bronze "P" or "I" link to its chain. The first competition in 1925 led to a 0–0 tie, resulting in the first link on the chain being an "IP." [ 179 ] As of 13 January 2024 [update] , Purdue led the series 77–42–6.

During " Breakfast Club ", best described as a cross between a pep rally and a Halloween party, students and even some alumni dress up in costumes, from traditional Halloween garb to creative hand-made costumes, as they bar-hop before Boilermaker home football games. The Breakfast Club plays a significant role during the football season and is informally a part of Purdue tradition. Many Boilermaker fans are dedicated; getting up at 5:00 a.m. on Saturdays and lining up at the bars on Chauncey Hill and the levee by 6:00 a.m. on game days. The Breakfast Club tradition began in the 1980s during the annual Purdue Grand Prix race in April.

[ 180 ] [ 181 ] Another tradition is Saturday morning wake-ups, where the Boilermaker Special uses its many loud horns and whistles to wake dorm students up in preparation for the day's game.

[ 182 ] Basketball [ edit ] The Purdue Boilermakers men's basketball team competes in NCAA Division I and is a member of the Big Ten Conference. Purdue won its 25th Big Ten Conference Championship and 2nd Big Ten Tournament Championship in 2023. This leads the conference, as Indiana University Bloomington is second with 22 conference championships. The Boilermakers were retroactively designated the 1932 national champions by the Helms Athletic Foundation and the Premo-Porretta Power Poll , but have not won an NCAA Championship: they were the 1969 runner-up, falling to legendary coach and former Purdue player John Wooden -led UCLA in the national championship game, the 1980 third-place finisher, falling to UCLA in the semifinals of the Final Four but defeating Iowa in the consolation game, and the 2024 runner-up, falling to Connecticut in the national championship game. The Purdue men's team has sent more than 30 players to the NBA including two overall No. 1 picks in the NBA draft. The Purdue women's basketball team were the 1999 NCAA Champions and 2001 runners-up. The Boilermakers men's and women's basketball teams have won more Big Ten Championships than any other conference school, with 32 regular-season conference titles and 11 Big Ten Tournament titles. Purdue men's basketball achieved an all-time winning record against all Big Ten Schools when it gained a winning record over Ohio State with three wins in 2023, improving that record from 91–92 to 94–92.
