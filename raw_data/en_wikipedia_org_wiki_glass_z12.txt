[ 8 ] [ 9 ] It has a spectroscopic redshift of 12.34, making it one of the most distant galaxies and astronomical objects ever discovered. According to current theory, this redshift corresponds to a time about 13.44 billion years ago, approximately 355 million years after the Big Bang , or about 2,57% of its current age .

[ 10 ] Discovery [ edit ] GLASS-z12/GHZ2, was initially discovered as a robust z ≈ 12.0–12.5 candidate by Castellano et al. and Naidu et al. in the GLASS-JWST Early Release Science NIRCam field. The two discovery papers appeared on arXiv the same day. Hence these two names for this galaxy of GLASS-z12 (Naidu et al. 2022) and GHZ2 (Castellano et al. 2022a).

[ 11 ] GLASS-z12 derives its name from the GLASS survey that discovered it and its estimated photometric redshift of approximately z = 12.4 +0.1 −0.3 .

[ 1 ] GLASS-z12 was initially announced as GLASS-z13 because it was thought to have a higher redshift of z = 13.1.

[ 7 ] [ 2 ] This redshift value was later revised down to z = 12.4 in October 2022, resulting in the renaming of this galaxy.

[ 1 ] It was discovered alongside another galaxy, GLASS-z10, comparable to GN-z11 , also one of the oldest galaxies discovered.

[ 12 ] Color composite of JWST- NIRCam images showing GLASS-z12 as a red dot among other galaxies Spectroscopy by the Atacama Large Millimeter Array [ edit ] Spectroscopic observations of GLASS-z12 by the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) in August 2022 confirmed that the galaxy has a spectroscopic redshift of 12.117 ± 0.012 , making it one of the earliest and most distant galaxies ever discovered, dating back to 360 million years after the Big Bang , 13.44 billion years ago .

[ 12 ] [ 5 ] ALMA observations detected an emission line associated with doubly ionized oxygen (O III) at 258.7 GHz with a significance of 5σ, suggesting that there is very low dust content in GLASS-z12, if not the early universe as well.

[ 2 ] Also based on oxygen-related measurements, the age of the galaxy is confirmed.

[ 13 ] [ 14 ] GLASS-z12 has a light-travel distance ( lookback time ) of 13.4 billion years.

[ 5 ] However, due to the expansion of the universe , its present proper distance is 32.718 billion light-years.

[ 5 ] Spectroscopy by the James Webb Space Telescope [ edit ] This galaxy was observed again in October 2023 by the James Webb Space Telescope with the NIRSpec and MIRI spectrographs, making it the most distant redshift galaxy of z = 12.34 with full spectroscopic coverage from ultraviolet (UV) to optical.

[ 11 ] [ 15 ] According to current ΛCDM parameters ( H 0 = 67.4, Ω m = 0.315, Ω Λ = 0.685), this redshift of 12.34 corresponds to a light-travel distance ( lookback time ) of 13.44 billion years. However, due to the expansion of the universe , its comoving distance is 32.837 Gly.
