[Methane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane "Methane") (CH 4) is among the simplest organic compounds.

Some chemical authorities define an **organic compound** as a [chemical compound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound "Chemical compound") that contains a [carbon–hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon%E2%80%93hydrogen_bond "Carbon–hydrogen bond") or [carbon–carbon bond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon%E2%80%93carbon_bond "Carbon–carbon bond"); others consider an organic compound to be any chemical compound that contains carbon. For example, carbon-containing compounds such as [alkanes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkane "Alkane") (e.g. [methane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane "Methane")CH 4) and its derivatives are universally considered organic, but many others are sometimes considered [inorganic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inorganic_compound "Inorganic compound"), such as certain compounds of carbon with [nitrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen "Nitrogen") and [oxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen "Oxygen") (e.g. [cyanide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanide "Cyanide") ion CN−, [hydrogen cyanide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_cyanide "Hydrogen cyanide")HCN, [chloroformic acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloroformic_acid "Chloroformic acid")ClCO 2 H, [carbon dioxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide "Carbon dioxide")CO 2, and [carbonate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonate "Carbonate") ion CO 2−3).[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

Due to carbon's ability to [catenate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catenate "Catenate") (form chains with other carbon [atoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom "Atom")), millions of organic compounds are known. The study of the properties, reactions, and syntheses of organic compounds comprise the discipline known as [organic chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_chemistry "Organic chemistry"). For historical reasons, a few classes of carbon-containing compounds (e.g., carbonate salts and cyanide salts), along with a few other exceptions (e.g., carbon dioxide, and even hydrogen cyanide despite the fact it contains a carbon–hydrogen bond), are generally considered [inorganic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inorganic_chemistry "Inorganic chemistry"). Other than those just named, little consensus exists among chemists on precisely which carbon-containing compounds are excluded, making any rigorous definition of an organic compound elusive.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_compound#cite_note-text-1)

Although organic compounds make up only a small percentage of [Earth's crust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_crust "Earth's crust"), they are of central importance because all known life is based on organic compounds. Living things incorporate inorganic carbon compounds into organic compounds through a network of processes (the [carbon cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_cycle "Carbon cycle")) that begins with the conversion of carbon dioxide and a hydrogen source like [water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water "Water") into [simple sugars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_sugar "Simple sugar") and other organic [molecules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule "Molecule") by [autotrophic organisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotroph "Autotroph") using light ([photosynthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynthesis "Photosynthesis")) or other sources of energy. Most synthetically-produced organic compounds are ultimately derived from [petrochemicals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrochemical "Petrochemical") consisting mainly of [hydrocarbons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrocarbon "Hydrocarbon"), which are themselves formed from the high pressure and temperature degradation of organic matter underground over geological timescales.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_compound#cite_note-2) This ultimate derivation notwithstanding, organic compounds are no longer defined as compounds originating in living things, as they were historically.

In chemical nomenclature, an [organyl group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organyl_group "Organyl group"), frequently represented by the letter R, refers to any [monovalent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valence_(chemistry) "Valence (chemistry)")[substituent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substituent "Substituent") whose open valence is on a carbon atom.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_compound#cite_note-3)

For historical reasons discussed below, a few types of carbon-containing compounds, such as [carbides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbide "Carbide"), [carbonates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonate "Carbonate") (excluding [carbonate esters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonate_ester "Carbonate ester")), simple [oxides of carbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxides_of_carbon "Oxides of carbon") (for example, [CO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide "Carbon monoxide") and [CO 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide "Carbon dioxide")) and [cyanides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanide "Cyanide") are generally considered [inorganic compounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inorganic_compound "Inorganic compound"). Different forms ([allotropes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotropes "Allotropes")) of pure carbon, such as [diamond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond "Diamond"), [graphite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphite "Graphite"), [fullerenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fullerene "Fullerene") and [carbon nanotubes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_nanotube "Carbon nanotube")[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_compound#cite_note-4) are also excluded because they are simple substances composed of a single element and so not generally considered chemical compounds. The word "organic" in this context does not mean "natural".[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_compound#cite_note-5)

[Vitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitalism "Vitalism") was a widespread conception that substances found in organic nature are formed from the chemical elements by the action of a "vital force"[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_compound#cite_note-Encyclopedia_Britannica_1998_l574-6) or "life-force" (_vis vitalis_) that only living organisms possess.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_compound#cite_note-Naylor_2023-7)

In the 1810s, [Jöns Jacob Berzelius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%B6ns_Jacob_Berzelius "Jöns Jacob Berzelius") argued that a regulative force must exist within living bodies. Berzelius also contended that compounds could be distinguished by whether they required any organisms in their [synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosynthesis "Biosynthesis") (organic compounds) or whether they did not ([inorganic compounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inorganic_compounds "Inorganic compounds")).[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_compound#cite_note-8) Vitalism taught that formation of these "organic" compounds were fundamentally different from the "inorganic" compounds that could be obtained from the elements by chemical manipulations in laboratories.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_compound#cite_note-Coulter_2019-9)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_compound#cite_note-Routledge_Encyclopedia_of_Philosophy_2024_c869-10)

Vitalism survived for a short period after the formulation of modern ideas about the [atomic theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_theory "Atomic theory") and [chemical elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element "Chemical element"). It first came under question in 1824, when [Friedrich Wöhler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_W%C3%B6hler "Friedrich Wöhler") synthesized [oxalic acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxalic_acid "Oxalic acid"), a compound known to occur only in living organisms, from [cyanogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanogen "Cyanogen"). A further experiment was [Wöhler's 1828 synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W%C3%B6hler_synthesis "Wöhler synthesis") of [urea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urea "Urea") from the inorganic [salts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(chemistry) "Salt (chemistry)")[potassium cyanate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium_cyanate "Potassium cyanate") and [ammonium sulfate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonium_sulfate "Ammonium sulfate"). Urea had long been considered an "organic" compound, as it was known to occur only in the urine of living organisms. Wöhler's experiments were followed by many others, in which increasingly complex "organic" substances were produced from "inorganic" ones without the involvement of any living organism, thus disproving vitalism.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_compound#cite_note-11)

### Modern classification and ambiguities

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Organic_compound&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Modern classification and ambiguities")]

[![Image 2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/L-isoleucine-3D-balls.png/250px-L-isoleucine-3D-balls.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:L-isoleucine-3D-balls.png)

The [L-isoleucine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoleucine "Isoleucine") molecule, C 6 H 13 NO 2, showing features typical of organic compounds. Carbon atoms are in black, hydrogens gray, oxygens red, and nitrogen blue.

Although vitalism has been discredited, scientific nomenclature retains the distinction between _organic_ and _inorganic_ compounds. The modern meaning of _organic compound_ is any compound that contains a significant amount of carbon—even though many of the organic compounds known today have no connection to any substance found in living organisms. The term _carbogenic_ has been proposed by [E. J. Corey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._J._Corey "E. J. Corey") as a modern alternative to _organic_, but this neologism remains relatively obscure.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

The organic compound [L-isoleucine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoleucine "Isoleucine") molecule presents some features typical of organic compounds: [carbon–carbon bonds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon%E2%80%93carbon_bond "Carbon–carbon bond"), [carbon–hydrogen bonds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon%E2%80%93hydrogen_bond "Carbon–hydrogen bond"), as well as covalent bonds from carbon to oxygen and to nitrogen.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

As described in detail below, any definition of organic compound that uses simple, broadly-applicable criteria turns out to be unsatisfactory, to varying degrees. The modern, commonly accepted definition of organic compound essentially amounts to any carbon-containing compound, excluding several classes of substances traditionally considered "inorganic". The list of substances so excluded varies from author to author. Still, it is generally agreed upon that there are (at least) a few carbon-containing compounds that should not be considered organic. For instance, almost all authorities would require the exclusion of [alloys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alloys "Alloys") that contain carbon, including [steel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel "Steel") (which contains [cementite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cementite "Cementite"), Fe 3 C), as well as other metal and semimetal carbides (including "ionic" carbides, e.g, [Al 4 C 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al4C3 "Al4C3") and [CaC 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_carbide "Calcium carbide") and "covalent" carbides, e.g. [B 4 C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boron_carbide "Boron carbide") and [SiC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_carbide "Silicon carbide"), and graphite intercalation compounds, e.g. [KC 8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphite_intercalation_compound "Graphite intercalation compound")). Other compounds and materials that are considered 'inorganic' by most authorities include: metal [carbonates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonates "Carbonates"), simple [oxides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxides "Oxides") of carbon ([CO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide "Carbon monoxide"), [CO 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide "Carbon dioxide"), and arguably, [C 3 O 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_suboxide "Carbon suboxide")), the [allotropes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotropes "Allotropes") of carbon, [cyanide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanides "Cyanides") derivatives not containing an organic residue (e.g., [KCN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium_cyanide "Potassium cyanide"), [(CN)2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanogen "Cyanogen"), [BrCN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanogen_bromide "Cyanogen bromide"), [cyanate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanate "Cyanate") anion OCN−, etc.), and heavier analogs thereof (e.g., [cyaphide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyaphide "Cyaphide") anion CP−, [CSe 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_diselenide "Carbon diselenide"), [COS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonyl_sulfide "Carbonyl sulfide"); although [carbon disulfide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_disulfide "Carbon disulfide")CS 2 is often classed as an _organic_ solvent). Halides of carbon without hydrogen (e.g., [CF 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_tetrafluoride "Carbon tetrafluoride") and [CClF 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorotrifluoromethane "Chlorotrifluoromethane")), [phosgene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosgene "Phosgene") (COCl 2), [carboranes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carborane "Carborane"), [metal carbonyls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_carbonyl "Metal carbonyl") (e.g., [nickel tetracarbonyl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel_tetracarbonyl "Nickel tetracarbonyl")), [mellitic anhydride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mellitic_anhydride "Mellitic anhydride") (C 12 O 9), and other exotic [oxocarbons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxocarbon "Oxocarbon") are also considered inorganic by some authorities.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

[Nickel tetracarbonyl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel_tetracarbonyl "Nickel tetracarbonyl") (Ni(CO)4) and other metal carbonyls are often volatile liquids, like many organic compounds, yet they contain only carbon bonded to a transition metal and to oxygen, and are often prepared directly from metal and [carbon monoxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide "Carbon monoxide"). Nickel tetracarbonyl is typically classified as an _organometallic compound_ as it satisfies the broad definition that [organometallic chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organometallic_chemistry "Organometallic chemistry") covers all compounds that contain at least one carbon to metal covalent bond; it is unknown whether organometallic compounds form a subset of organic compounds. For example, the evidence of covalent Fe-C bonding in [cementite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cementite "Cementite"),[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_compound#cite_note-12) a major component of steel, places it within this broad definition of organometallic, yet steel and other carbon-containing alloys are seldom regarded as organic compounds. Thus, it is unclear whether the definition of organometallic should be narrowed, whether these considerations imply that organometallic compounds are not necessarily organic, or both.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

Metal complexes with organic ligands but no carbon-metal bonds (e.g., [(CH 3 CO 2)2 Cu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper(II)_acetate "Copper(II) acetate")) are not considered organometallic; instead, they are called [metal-organic compounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal-organic_compound "Metal-organic compound") (and might be considered organic).

The relatively narrow definition of organic compounds as those containing C–H bonds excludes compounds that are (historically and practically) considered organic. Neither [urea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urea "Urea")CO(NH 2)2 nor [oxalic acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxalic_acid "Oxalic acid")(COOH)2 are organic by this definition, yet they were two key compounds in the vitalism debate. However, the [IUPAC Blue Book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomenclature_of_Organic_Chemistry "Nomenclature of Organic Chemistry") on organic nomenclature specifically mentions urea[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_compound#cite_note-13) and oxalic acid[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_compound#cite_note-14) as organic compounds. Other compounds lacking C–H bonds but traditionally considered organic include [benzenehexol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzenehexol "Benzenehexol"), [mesoxalic acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoxalic_acid "Mesoxalic acid"), and [carbon tetrachloride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_tetrachloride "Carbon tetrachloride"). [Mellitic acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mellitic_acid "Mellitic acid"), which contains no C–H bonds, is considered a possible organic compound in [Martian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars "Mars") soil.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_compound#cite_note-15) Terrestrially, it, and its anhydride, [mellitic anhydride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mellitic_anhydride "Mellitic anhydride"), are associated with the mineral [mellite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mellite "Mellite") (Al 2 C 6(COO)6·16H 2 O).

A slightly broader definition of the organic compound includes all compounds bearing C–H or C–C bonds. This would still exclude urea. Moreover, this definition still leads to somewhat arbitrary divisions in sets of carbon-halogen compounds. For example, [CF 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrafluoromethane "Tetrafluoromethane") and [CCl 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_tetrachloride "Carbon tetrachloride") would be considered by this rule to be "inorganic", whereas [CHF 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoroform "Fluoroform"), [CHCl 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloroform "Chloroform"), and [C 2 Cl 6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexachloroethane "Hexachloroethane") would be organic, though these compounds share many physical and chemical properties.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

Organic compounds may be classified in a variety of ways. One major distinction is between natural and synthetic compounds. Organic compounds can also be classified or subdivided by the presence of [heteroatoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heteroatom "Heteroatom"), e.g., [organometallic compounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organometallic_compound "Organometallic compound"), which feature bonds between carbon and a [metal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal "Metal"), and [organophosphorus compounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organophosphorus_compound "Organophosphorus compound"), which feature bonds between carbon and a [phosphorus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorus "Phosphorus").[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

Another distinction, based on the size of organic compounds, distinguishes between [small molecules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_molecule "Small molecule") and [polymers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer "Polymer").

[Natural compounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_compound "Natural compound") refer to those that are produced by plants or animals. Many of these are still extracted from natural sources because they would be more expensive to produce artificially. Examples include most [sugars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar "Sugar"), some [alkaloids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaloid "Alkaloid") and [terpenoids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terpenoid "Terpenoid"), certain nutrients such as [vitamin B 12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B12 "Vitamin B12"), and, in general, those natural products with large or [stereoisometrically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereoisomer "Stereoisomer") complicated molecules present in reasonable concentrations in living organisms.

Further compounds of prime importance in [biochemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry "Biochemistry") are [antigens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen "Antigen"), [carbohydrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate "Carbohydrate"), [enzymes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme "Enzyme"), [hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone "Hormone"), [lipids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid "Lipid") and [fatty acids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid "Fatty acid"), [neurotransmitters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter "Neurotransmitter"), [nucleic acids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid "Nucleic acid"), [proteins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein "Protein"), [peptides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide "Peptide") and [amino acids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid "Amino acid"), [lectins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lectin "Lectin"), [vitamins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin "Vitamin"), and [fats and oils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fats_and_oils "Fats and oils").

### Synthetic compounds

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Organic_compound&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Synthetic compounds")]

Compounds that are prepared by reaction of other compounds are known as "[synthetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis "Chemical synthesis")". They may be either compounds that are already found in plants/animals or those artificial compounds that do not [occur naturally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturally_occurring "Naturally occurring").[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

Most [polymers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer "Polymer") (a category that includes all [plastics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic "Plastic") and [rubbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber "Rubber")) are organic synthetic or semi-synthetic compounds.

Many organic compounds—two examples are [ethanol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol "Ethanol") and [insulin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin "Insulin")—are manufactured industrially using organisms such as bacteria and yeast.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_compound#cite_note-16) Typically, the [DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA "DNA") of an organism is altered to express compounds not ordinarily produced by the organism. Many such [biotechnology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biotechnology "Biotechnology")-engineered compounds did not previously exist in nature.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_compound#cite_note-17)

*   The _[CAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical\_Abstracts\_Service "Chemical Abstracts Service")_ database is the most comprehensive repository for data on organic compounds. The search tool _[SciFinder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical\_Abstracts\_Service#SciFinder "Chemical Abstracts Service")_ is offered.
*   The _[Beilstein database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beilstein\_database "Beilstein database")_ contains information on 9.8 million substances, covers the scientific literature from 1771 to the present, and is today accessible via [Reaxys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaxys "Reaxys"). Structures and a large diversity of physical and chemical properties are available for each substance, with reference to original literature.
*   _[PubChem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubChem "PubChem")_ contains 18.4 million entries on compounds and especially covers the field of [medicinal chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicinal_chemistry "Medicinal chemistry").

A great number of more specialized databases exist for diverse branches of organic chemistry.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_compound#cite_note-18)
