[ 1 ] [ 2 ] It is a starting point of a long term and interactive matching process between external technologies and internal requirements of an existing organization for strategic purposes.

[ 3 ] This matching may also be aided by technology roadmapping .

[ 4 ] Technology scouting is also known to be part of competitive intelligence , which firms apply as a tool of competitive strategy.

[ 5 ] It can also be regarded as a method of technology forecasting [ 6 ] or in the broader context also an element of corporate foresight .

[ 7 ] Technology scouting may also be applied as an element of an open innovation approach.

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] Technology scouting is seen as an essential element of a modern technology management system.

[ 10 ] The technology scout is either an employee of the company or an external consultant who engages in boundary spanning processes to tap into novel knowledge and span internal boundaries.

[ 11 ] They may be assigned part-time or full-time to the scouting task. The desired characteristics of a technology scout are similar to the characteristics associated with the technological gatekeeper.  These characteristics include being a lateral thinker , knowledgeable in science and technology, respected inside the company, cross-disciplinary orientated, and imaginative personality.

[ 1 ] Technology scouts would also often play a vital role in a formalised technology foresight process.
