[ 3 ] [ 4 ] The concept includes flybys of Jupiter and Neptune with a focus on Neptune's largest moon Triton .

In 2020, Trident was selected along with three other Discovery proposals for further study, with two expected to be selected to fly as Discovery 15 and 16 .

[ 5 ] On 2 June 2021, NASA selected the Venus missions DAVINCI+ and VERITAS over Trident and the Io Volcano Observer .

[ 6 ] History [ edit ] Triton is the largest moon of Neptune . In 1989, Voyager 2 flew past the moon at a distance of 40,000 km (25,000 mi), [ 7 ] and discovered several cryovolcanoes on its surface. Triton is geologically active, its surface is young and has relatively few impact craters. It has a very thin atmosphere . Voyager 2 was only able to observe approximately 40% of Triton's surface.

The Trident concept was proposed in March 2019 to NASA's Discovery Program . The mission concept is supported by NASA's Ocean Worlds Exploration Program and it is intended to help answer some of the questions generated by Voyager 2's flyby in 1989.

[ 8 ] Overview [ edit ] Trident takes advantage of an efficient gravity assist alignment of Jupiter and Neptune (that occurs once every 13 years) to capitalize on a narrow observational window that enables assessment of changes in Triton's plume activity and surface characteristics since the previous encounter of Neptune-Triton by Voyager 2 in 1989.

[ 3 ] [ 9 ] With the advances of high-resolution imaging and a unique orbital configuration of Triton in 2038, Trident would be able to obtain a near-complete map of Neptune's moon during its sole flyby .

Trident would pass through Triton's thin atmosphere , within 500 km (310 mi) of the surface, sampling its ionosphere with a plasma spectrometer and perform magnetic induction measurements to assess the potential existence of an internal ocean.

[ 3 ] The principal investigator is Louise Prockter , director of the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston, Texas.

[ 9 ] The launch vehicle proposed for Trident is the Atlas V 401, if it is not replaced with the Vulcan .

[ 2 ] The proposed launch date in October 2025 (with a backup in October 2026) would take advantage of a once-in-13-years window, when Earth is properly aligned with Jupiter. The spacecraft would use the gravitational pull of Jupiter as a slingshot straight to Triton for an extended 13-day encounter in 2038.
