In geometry , a rhombus ( pl.

: rhombi or rhombuses ) is an equilateral quadrilateral , a quadrilateral whose four sides all have the same length. Other names for rhombus include diamond , lozenge , and calisson .

Every rhombus is simple (non-self-intersecting), and is a special case of a parallelogram and a kite . A rhombus with right angles is a square .

[ 1 ] Etymology The name rhombus comes from Greek ῥόμβος rhómbos , meaning something that spins, such as a bullroarer or an ancient precursor of the button whirligig .

[ 2 ] The word was used both by Euclid and Archimedes , who also used the term "solid rhombus" for a bicone , two right circular cones sharing a common base.

[ 3 ] A planar rhombus is a cross section of a bicone.

The name diamond comes from the shape of an octahedral diamond gemstone; the diamonds suit in playing cards is named after the shape – it was originally called carreaux (lit. "squares") in French.

[ 4 ] In the context of polyiamonds , shapes like polyominos but constructed from equilateral triangles, a diamond is a rhombus with a 60° angle.

The etymology of lozenge is uncertain. It might come from a shape of some lauzinaj almond pastries, or from the shape of tombstones. A lozenge is often specifically to a rhombus with a 45° angle.

A calisson is a type of rhombus-shaped French sweet.

A simple (non- self-intersecting ) quadrilateral is a rhombus if and only if it is any one of the following: [ 6 ] [ 7 ] a parallelogram in which a diagonal bisects an interior angle a parallelogram in which at least two consecutive sides are equal in length a parallelogram in which the diagonals are perpendicular (an orthodiagonal parallelogram) a quadrilateral with four sides of equal length (by definition) a quadrilateral in which the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other a quadrilateral in which each diagonal bisects two opposite interior angles a quadrilateral ABCD possessing a point P in its plane such that the four triangles ABP , BCP , CDP , and DAP are all congruent [ 8 ] a quadrilateral ABCD in which the incircles in triangles ABC , BCD , CDA and DAB have a common point [ 9 ] Basic properties Every rhombus has two diagonals connecting pairs of opposite vertices, and two pairs of parallel sides. Using congruent triangles , one can prove that the rhombus is symmetric across each of these diagonals. It follows that any rhombus has the following properties: Opposite angles of a rhombus have equal measure.

The two diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular ; that is, a rhombus is an orthodiagonal quadrilateral .

Its diagonals bisect opposite angles.

The first property implies that every rhombus is a parallelogram . A rhombus therefore has all of the properties of a parallelogram : for example, opposite sides are parallel; adjacent angles are supplementary ; the two diagonals bisect one another; any line through the midpoint bisects the area; and the sum of the squares of the sides equals the sum of the squares of the diagonals (the parallelogram law ). Thus denoting the common side as a and the diagonals as p and q , in every rhombus 4 a 2 = p 2 + q 2 .

{\displaystyle \displaystyle 4a^{2}=p^{2}+q^{2}.} Not every parallelogram is a rhombus, though any parallelogram with perpendicular diagonals (the second property) is a rhombus. In general, any quadrilateral with perpendicular diagonals, one of which is a line of symmetry, is a kite . Every rhombus is a kite, and any quadrilateral that is both a kite and parallelogram is a rhombus.

A rhombus is a tangential quadrilateral .

[ 10 ] That is, it has an inscribed circle that is tangent to all four sides.

A rhombus. Each angle marked with a black dot is a right angle. The height h is the perpendicular distance between any two non-adjacent sides, which equals the diameter of the circle inscribed. The diagonals of lengths p and q are the red dotted line segments.

Diagonals The length of the diagonals p = AC and q = BD can be expressed in terms of the rhombus side a and one vertex angle α as p = a 2 + 2 cos ⁡ ⁡ α α {\displaystyle p=a{\sqrt {2+2\cos {\alpha }}}} and q = a 2 − − 2 cos ⁡ ⁡ α α .

{\displaystyle q=a{\sqrt {2-2\cos {\alpha }}}.} These formulas are a direct consequence of the law of cosines .

Inradius The inradius (the radius of a circle inscribed in the rhombus), denoted by r , can be expressed in terms of the diagonals p and q as [ 10 ] r = p ⋅ ⋅ q 2 p 2 + q 2 , {\displaystyle r={\frac {p\cdot q}{2{\sqrt {p^{2}+q^{2}}}}},} or in terms of the side length a and any vertex angle α or β as r = a sin ⁡ ⁡ α α 2 = a sin ⁡ ⁡ β β 2 .

{\displaystyle r={\frac {a\sin \alpha }{2}}={\frac {a\sin \beta }{2}}.} Area As for all parallelograms , the area K of a rhombus is the product of its base and its height ( h ). The base is simply any side length a : K = a ⋅ ⋅ h .

{\displaystyle K=a\cdot h.} The area can also be expressed as the base squared times the sine of any angle: K = a 2 ⋅ ⋅ sin ⁡ ⁡ α α = a 2 ⋅ ⋅ sin ⁡ ⁡ β β , {\displaystyle K=a^{2}\cdot \sin \alpha =a^{2}\cdot \sin \beta ,} or in terms of the height and a vertex angle : K = h 2 sin ⁡ ⁡ α α , {\displaystyle K={\frac {h^{2}}{\sin \alpha }},} or as half the product of the diagonals p , q : K = p ⋅ ⋅ q 2 , {\displaystyle K={\frac {p\cdot q}{2}},} or as the semiperimeter times the radius of the circle inscribed in the rhombus (inradius): K = 2 a ⋅ ⋅ r .

{\displaystyle K=2a\cdot r.} Another way, in common with parallelograms, is to consider two adjacent sides as vectors, forming a bivector , so the area is the magnitude of the bivector (the magnitude of the vector product of the two vectors), which is the determinant of the two vectors' Cartesian coordinates: K = x 1 y 2 – x 2 y 1 .

Dual properties The dual polygon of a rhombus is a rectangle : [ 11 ] A rhombus has all sides equal, while a rectangle has all angles equal.

A rhombus has opposite angles equal, while a rectangle has opposite sides equal.

A rhombus has an inscribed circle, while a rectangle has a circumcircle .

A rhombus has an axis of symmetry through each pair of opposite vertex angles, while a rectangle has an axis of symmetry through each pair of opposite sides.

The diagonals of a rhombus intersect at equal angles, while the diagonals of a rectangle are equal in length.

The figure formed by joining the midpoints of the sides of a rhombus is a rectangle , and vice versa.

Cartesian equation The sides of a rhombus centered at the origin, with diagonals each falling on an axis, consist of all points ( x, y ) satisfying | x a | + | y b | = 1.

{\displaystyle \left|{\frac {x}{a}}\right|\!+\left|{\frac {y}{b}}\right|\!=1.} The vertices are at ( ± ± a , 0 ) {\displaystyle (\pm a,0)} and ( 0 , ± ± b ) .

{\displaystyle (0,\pm b).} This is a special case of the superellipse , with exponent 1.

Other properties One of the five 2D lattice types is the rhombic lattice, also called centered rectangular lattice .

Rhombi can tile the 2D plane edge-to-edge and periodically in three different ways, including, for the 60° rhombus, the rhombille tiling .

As topological square tilings As 30-60 degree rhombille tiling Three-dimensional analogues of a rhombus include the bipyramid and the bicone as a surface of revolution .

As the faces of a polyhedron Convex polyhedra with rhombi include the infinite set of rhombic zonohedrons , which can be seen as projective envelopes of hypercubes .

A rhombohedron (also called a rhombic hexahedron) is a three-dimensional figure like a cuboid (also called a rectangular parallelepiped), except that its 3 pairs of parallel faces are up to 3 types of rhombi instead of rectangles.

The rhombic dodecahedron is a convex polyhedron with 12 congruent rhombi as its faces .

The rhombic triacontahedron is a convex polyhedron with 30 golden rhombi (rhombi whose diagonals are in the golden ratio ) as its faces.

The great rhombic triacontahedron is a nonconvex isohedral , isotoxal polyhedron with 30 intersecting rhombic faces.

The rhombic hexecontahedron is a stellation of the rhombic triacontahedron. It is nonconvex with 60 golden rhombic faces with icosahedral symmetry .

The rhombic enneacontahedron is a polyhedron composed of 90 rhombic faces, with three, five, or six rhombi meeting at each vertex. It has 60 broad rhombi and 30 slim ones.

The rhombic icosahedron is a polyhedron composed of 20 rhombic faces, of which three, four, or five meet at each vertex. It has 10 faces on the polar axis with 10 faces following the equator.
