Pyrosoma atlanticum , a tunicate , is a colony of zooids A zooid or zoöid / ˈ z oʊ .

ɔɪ d / is an animal that is part of a colonial animal . This lifestyle has been adopted by  animals from separate unrelated taxa.  Zooids are multicellular ; their structure is similar to that of other solitary animals. The zooids can either be directly connected by tissue (e.g.

corals , Catenulida , Siphonophorae , Pyrosome or Ectoprocta ) or share a common exoskeleton (e.g.

Bryozoa or Pterobranchia ).

[ 1 ] The colonial organism as a whole is called a zoon / ˈ z oʊ .

ɒ n / , plural zoa (from Ancient Greek zôion ζῷον meaning animal; plural zôia , ζῷα ).

Zooids can exhibit polymorphism . For instance, extant bryozoans may have zooids adapted for different functions, such as feeding, anchoring the colony to the substratum and for brooding embryos.

[ 2 ] However, fossil bryozoans are only known by the colony structures that the zooids formed during life.

[ 3 ] There are correlations between the size of some zooids and temperature.

[ 4 ] Variations in zooid size within colonies of fossils can be used as an indicator of the temperature and the seasonality of seas in the geological past.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] The term zooid has historically also been used for an organic cell or organized body that has independent movement within a living organism, especially a motile gamete such as a spermatozoon (in the case of algae now zoid ), or an independent animal-like organism produced asexually, as by budding or fission .
