This concept was developed in the scope of management studies in 2005 by Göran Ahrne and Nils Brunsson .

[ 1 ] Meta-organization design is suggested to differ from organization design in that intra-firm design may have less of an authority in the former.

[ 2 ] While the scope and reach of meta-organisations can be wide and effective (the United Nations being a key example), the contrasting values and interests of members, combined with high levels of independence, can complicate decision-making and hinder innovation.
