"More climate action" is a central demand of the climate movement .

[ 1 ] Climate inaction is the absence of climate action.

Examples [ edit ] Some examples of climate action include: Business action on climate change Climate change adaptation Climate change mitigation Climate finance Climate movement – actions by non-governmental organizations Individual action on climate change Politics of climate change Obstacles [ edit ] Human behaviour [ edit ] Barriers to pro-environmental behaviour Climate change denial Media coverage of climate change Psychology of climate change denial See also [ edit ] Causes of climate change Effects of climate change Sustainable Development Goal 13 on climate action References [ edit ] ^ Maher, Julie (26 March 2021).
