Ionosphere and Radio Wave Propagation Research Group [ edit ] Research focuses on the impact on high technology in the Earth environment (navigation and communication). Research is conducted in the form of understanding space phenomena that have an impact on technology related to stakeholders.

Astronomy and Observatory Research Group [ edit ] Chaired by Thomas Djamaluddin, research focuses on strengthening astronomy and astrophysics research, technical development and conservation of the area around the observatory, and astronomy for the community.

Space Environment Dynamics Research Group [ edit ] Research focuses on the dynamics of processes in interplanetary space down to the Earth's environment. Research explores fundamental processes in interplanetary space that impact Earth.

Services [ edit ] The Centre for Space Research provides global space weather prediction and information services, as part of Indonesia's contribution to ISES (International Space Environment Services).

SWIFTS Structure [ edit ] As the latest Chairman of BRIN Decree No. 14/2023, the current structure of ORPA is as follows: Office of the Head of ORPA Research Center for Space Research Center for Aeronautics Technology Research Center for Satellite Technology Research Center for Rocket Technology Research Groups List of heads [ edit ] No.
