He got his master's degree as well as Ph.D in philosophy from Harvard University in 1951 and 1954 respectively.

[ 7 ] [ 4 ] Later, he became an instructor in the University of Southern California in 1954–55. He became an assistant professor in the University of Virginia and then was made an associate professor in the same university from 1956 to 1961. He became a professor at Ohio State University from 1961 to1964. He reached the peak of his career when he arrived at Johns Hopkins as a professor in 1964 where he was named professor emeritus upon his retirement in 2002.

Books [ edit ] Barker is the author of: Induction and hypothesis: a study of the logic of confirmation (Cornell University Press, 1957). This study of theories of informal reasoning is structured in four parts: an investigation of the problem of induction , a rejection of explanations based on overriding premises (such as the uniformity of nature) as a form of begging the question , an overview of positivist approaches to the problem, and finally a resolution to the problem based on theories of John George Kemeny involving the selection of the most likely hypothesis to fit a set of observations.

[ 8 ] Philosophy of mathematics (Prentice-Hall, 1964). Part of a series of books (edited by Elizabeth and Monroe Beardsley ) overviewing the main areas of philosophy, this book describes the main problems in the philosophy of mathematics and evaluates their proposed solutions. Its five chapters concern Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometry , and literalist and non-literalist views on the meaning of numbers.
