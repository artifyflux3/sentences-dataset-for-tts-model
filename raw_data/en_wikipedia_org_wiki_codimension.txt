In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), **codimension** is a basic [geometric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry") idea that applies to [subspaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_subspace "Vector subspace") in [vector spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space"), to [submanifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submanifold "Submanifold") in [manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold "Manifold"), and suitable [subsets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset "Subset") of [algebraic varieties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_varieties "Algebraic varieties").

For [affine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_variety "Affine variety") and [projective algebraic varieties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_algebraic_varieties "Projective algebraic varieties"), the codimension equals the [height](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Height_(ring_theory) "Height (ring theory)") of the defining [ideal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_(ring_theory) "Ideal (ring theory)"). For this reason, the height of an ideal is often called its codimension.

The dual concept is [relative dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_dimension "Relative dimension").

Codimension is a _relative_ concept: it is only defined for one object _inside_ another. There is no “codimension of a vector space (in isolation)”, only the codimension of a vector _sub_ space.

If _W_ is a [linear subspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_subspace "Linear subspace") of a [finite-dimensional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-dimensional "Finite-dimensional")[vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space")_V_, then the **codimension** of _W_ in _V_ is the difference between the dimensions:[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codimension#cite_note-1)

![Image 1: {\displaystyle \operatorname {codim} (W)=\dim(V)-\dim(W).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f0fcb266f68c5e2389568883015b4fdd810c8d1b)
It is the complement of the dimension of _W,_ in that, with the dimension of _W,_ it adds up to the dimension of the [ambient space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_space "Ambient space")_V:_

![Image 2: {\displaystyle \dim(W)+\operatorname {codim} (W)=\dim(V).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/60284698828c989f79b8f87b3c96692709f650ad)
Similarly, if _N_ is a submanifold or subvariety in _M_, then the codimension of _N_ in _M_ is

![Image 3: {\displaystyle \operatorname {codim} (N)=\dim(M)-\dim(N).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ce0b7e5e65840fdaf2177a6885a86d26b6826f61)
Just as the dimension of a submanifold is the dimension of the [tangent bundle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_bundle "Tangent bundle") (the number of dimensions that you can move _on_ the submanifold), the codimension is the dimension of the [normal bundle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_bundle "Normal bundle") (the number of dimensions you can move _off_ the submanifold).

More generally, if _W_ is a [linear subspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_subspace "Linear subspace") of a (possibly infinite dimensional) [vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space")_V_ then the codimension of _W_ in _V_ is the dimension (possibly infinite) of the [quotient space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotient_space_(linear_algebra) "Quotient space (linear algebra)")_V_/_W_, which is more abstractly known as the [cokernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cokernel "Cokernel") of the inclusion. For finite-dimensional vector spaces, this agrees with the previous definition

![Image 4: {\displaystyle \operatorname {codim} (W)=\dim(V/W)=\dim \operatorname {coker} (W\to V)=\dim(V)-\dim(W),}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b72b47807d6fdcee6d8424f0cf210ef9a411f664)
and is dual to the relative dimension as the dimension of the [kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(algebra) "Kernel (algebra)").

Finite-codimensional subspaces of infinite-dimensional spaces are often useful in the study of [topological vector spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_vector_space "Topological vector space").

Additivity of codimension and dimension counting
------------------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Codimension&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Additivity of codimension and dimension counting")]

The fundamental property of codimension lies in its relation to [intersection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersection_(set_theory) "Intersection (set theory)"): if _W_ 1 has codimension _k_ 1, and _W_ 2 has codimension _k_ 2, then if _U_ is their intersection with codimension _j_ we have

max (_k_ 1, _k_ 2) ≤ _j_ ≤ _k_ 1 + _k_ 2.
In fact _j_ may take any [integer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer "Integer") value in this range. This statement is more perspicuous than the translation in terms of dimensions, because the [RHS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sides_of_an_equation "Sides of an equation") is just the sum of the codimensions. In words

_codimensions (at most) add_.If the subspaces or submanifolds intersect [transversally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transversality_(mathematics) "Transversality (mathematics)") (which occurs [generically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_position "General position")), codimensions add exactly.
This statement is called **dimension counting,** particularly in [intersection theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersection_theory "Intersection theory").

Dual interpretation
-------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Codimension&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Dual interpretation")]

In terms of the [dual space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_space "Dual space"), it is quite evident why dimensions add. The subspaces can be defined by the vanishing of a certain number of [linear functionals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_functional "Linear functional"), which if we take to be [linearly independent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linearly_independent "Linearly independent"), their number is the codimension. Therefore, we see that _U_ is defined by taking the [union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_(set_theory) "Union (set theory)") of the sets of linear functionals defining the _W_ i. That union may introduce some degree of [linear dependence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_dependence "Linear dependence"): the possible values of _j_ express that dependence, with the RHS sum being the case where there is no dependence. This definition of codimension in terms of the number of functions needed to cut out a subspace extends to situations in which both the ambient space and subspace are infinite dimensional.

In other language, which is basic for any kind of [intersection theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersection_theory "Intersection theory"), we are taking the union of a certain number of [constraints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_(mathematics) "Constraint (mathematics)"). We have two phenomena to look out for:

1.   the two sets of constraints may not be independent;
2.   the two sets of constraints may not be compatible.

The first of these is often expressed as the **principle of counting [constraints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_(mathematics) "Constraint (mathematics)")**: if we have a number _N_ of [parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter "Parameter") to adjust (i.e. we have _N_[degrees of freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrees_of_freedom_(physics_and_chemistry) "Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)")), and a constraint means we have to 'consume' a parameter to satisfy it, then the codimension of the [solution set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution_set "Solution set") is _at most_ the number of constraints. We do not expect to be able to find a solution if the predicted codimension, i.e. the number of _independent_ constraints, exceeds _N_ (in the linear algebra case, there is always a _trivial_, [null vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_vector "Null vector") solution, which is therefore discounted).

The second is a matter of geometry, on the model of [parallel lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_lines "Parallel lines"); it is something that can be discussed for [linear problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_problem "Linear problem") by methods of linear algebra, and for non-linear problems in [projective space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_space "Projective space"), over the [complex number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number "Complex number") field.

In geometric topology
---------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Codimension&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: In geometric topology")]

Codimension also has some clear meaning in [geometric topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_topology "Geometric topology"): on a manifold, codimension 1 is the dimension of topological disconnection by a submanifold, while codimension 2 is the dimension of [ramification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramification_(mathematics) "Ramification (mathematics)") and [knot theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory "Knot theory"). In fact, the theory of high-dimensional manifolds, which starts in dimension 5 and above, can alternatively be said to start in codimension 3, because higher codimensions avoid the phenomenon of knots. Since [surgery theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery_theory "Surgery theory") requires working up to the middle dimension, once one is in dimension 5, the middle dimension has codimension greater than 2, and hence one avoids knots.

This quip is not vacuous: the study of [embeddings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedding "Embedding") in codimension 2 is knot theory, and difficult, while the study of embeddings in codimension 3 or more is amenable to the tools of high-dimensional geometric topology, and hence considerably easier.
