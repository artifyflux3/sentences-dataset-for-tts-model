This usage is not universal and the symbol has different meanings in other countries. Consequently, its use to denote division is deprecated in the ISO 80000-2 standard for notations used in mathematics, science and technology.

[ 1 ] In mathematics [ edit ] Plus and minuses. The obelus – or division sign –  used as a variant of the minus sign in an excerpt from an official Norwegian trading statement form called «Næringsoppgave 1» for the taxation year 2010.

Further information: Division (mathematics) § Notation The obelus , a historical glyph consisting of a horizontal line with (or without) one or more dots, was first used as a symbol for division in 1659, in the algebra book Teutsche Algebra by Johann Rahn , although previous writers had used the same symbol for subtraction.

[ 2 ] Some near-contemporaries believed that John Pell , who edited the book, may have been responsible for this use of the symbol.

[ 2 ] Other symbols for division include the slash or solidus / , the colon : , and the fraction bar (the horizontal bar in a vertical fraction).

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] The ISO 80000-2 standard for mathematical notation in science and technology recommends only the solidus / or "fraction bar" for division, or the "colon" : for ratios ; it says that the ÷ sign "should not be used" for division.

[ 1 ] In Italy , Poland and Russia , the ÷ sign was sometimes used to denote a range of values , and in Scandinavian countries it was, and sometimes still is, used as a negation sign: [ 5 ] the Unicode Consortium has allocated a separate code point , U+2052 ⁒ COMMERCIAL MINUS SIGN for this usage uniquely; [ 6 ] [ 7 ] the exact form of the symbol displayed is typeface (font) dependent.

In computer systems [ edit ] Encoding [ edit ] The symbol was assigned to code point 0xF7 in ISO 8859-1 , as the "division sign". This encoding was transferred to Unicode as U+00F7.

[ 8 ] In HTML , it can be encoded as &divide; or &#xF7; (at HTML level 3.2), or as &#247; .
