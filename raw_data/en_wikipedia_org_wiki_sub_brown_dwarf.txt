As the sub-brown dwarf ages, it will gradually cool and shrink.

A sub-brown dwarf or planetary-mass brown dwarf is an astronomical object that formed in the same manner as stars and brown dwarfs (i.e. through the collapse of a gas cloud ) but that has a planetary mass , therefore by definition below the limiting mass for thermonuclear fusion of deuterium (about 13 M J ).

[ 1 ] Some researchers include them in the category of rogue planets [ 2 ] whereas others call them planetary-mass brown dwarfs.

[ 3 ] Description [ edit ] Sub-brown dwarfs are formed in the manner of stars , through the collapse of a gas cloud (perhaps with the help of photo-erosion ) but there is no consensus amongst astronomers on whether the formation process should be taken into account when classifying an object as a planet.

[ 4 ] Free-floating sub-brown dwarfs can be observationally indistinguishable from rogue planets, which originally formed around a star and were ejected from orbit. Similarly, a sub-brown dwarf formed free-floating in a star cluster may be captured into orbit around a star, making distinguishing sub-brown dwarfs and large planets also difficult. A definition for the term "sub-brown dwarf" was put forward by the IAU Working Group on Extra-Solar Planets (WGESP), which defined it as a free-floating body found in young star clusters below the lower mass cut-off of brown dwarfs.

[ 5 ] Lower mass limit [ edit ] The smallest mass of gas cloud that could collapse to form a sub-brown dwarf is about 1 Jupiter mass (M J ).

[ 6 ] This is because to collapse by gravitational contraction requires radiating away energy as heat and this is limited by the opacity of the gas.

[ 7 ] A 3 M J candidate is described in a 2007 paper.

[ 8 ] List of possible sub-brown dwarfs [ edit ] Orbiting one or more stars [ edit ] There is no consensus whether these companions of stars should be considered sub-brown dwarfs or planets. Some authors agree these objects should be considered sub-brown dwarfs, since they likely formed on their own, like a "failed star".

[ 9 ] 2MASS J0441+2301 Bb Nonetheless, the IAU working definition of an exoplanet ignored formation mechanism as a criterion, and based on it these objects would be considered planets.

[ 10 ] WD 0806-661 B HD 106906 b ROXs 42Bb Orbiting a brown dwarf [ edit ] At around 2022 the IAU working definition of an exoplanet excludes these objects as planets.

[ 10 ] The only fitting label would be as sub-brown dwarfs, but they are more often referred as planetary mass objects . Other definitions, like from the NASA Exoplanet Archive [ 11 ] would include these as exoplanets. There is no consensus whether these companions of brown dwarfs should be considered sub-brown dwarfs or planets.

WISE J0336−0143B [ edit ] Main article: WISE J0336−0143 WISE J0336−0143B, orbits a brown dwarf or sub-brown dwarf. The primary has a mass of 8.5 to 18 M J and secondary has a mass of 5-11.5 M J . This object does not fit the IAU working definition of an exoplanet .

[ 10 ] This definition requires a mass ratio of about q<0.04, but the mass ratio of WISE J0336−0143AB is q=0.61±0.05.

[ 12 ] It also does not fit the definition of a rogue planet , because it is gravitationally bound to a brown dwarf (or possibly sub-brown dwarf). It could be considered a planet according to alternative definitions, but according to the IAU it only fits the definition of sub-brown dwarf.

2M1207b [ edit ] Main article: 2M1207b 2M1207b orbits around a young brown dwarf with a circumstellar disk and itself is likely surrounded by a circumstellar disk. The mass ratio is well above the upper limit of q=0.04 for exoplanets according to the IAU.

[ 13 ] Others [ edit ] Other examples of planetary-mass objects orbiting brown dwarfs and with M B <13 M J and q>0.04: CFHTWIR-Oph 98B , with M B = 11.6 +0.4 −0.8 M J and q= 0.509 +0.017 −0.023 [ 14 ] 2MASS J0249-0557ABc , with M c = 11.6 +1.3 −1.0 M J and q = M c M A B = 0.13 {\displaystyle q={M_{c} \over M_{AB}}=0.13} [ 15 ] Free-floating [ edit ] Also called rogue planets : WISE 0855–0714 3–10 M J about 7 light years away S Ori 52 UGPS 0722-05 10–25 M J 13 light years away Cha 110913-773444 5–15 M J 163 light years away CFBDSIR 2149−0403 4–7 M J 130 light years away OTS 44 11.5 M J 550 light years away PSO J318.5−22 6–8 M J about 80 light years away See also [ edit ] Look up sub-brown dwarf in Wiktionary, the free dictionary.
