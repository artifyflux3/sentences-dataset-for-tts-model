[ 1 ] The model is popular among some model builders , but has resisted being embedded into string theory .

Overview [ edit ] The DGP model assumes the existence of a 4+1-dimensional Minkowski space , within which ordinary 3+1-dimensional Minkowski space is embedded.  The model assumes an action consisting of two terms: One term is the usual Einstein–Hilbert action , which involves only the 4-D spacetime dimensions.  The other term is the equivalent of the Einstein–Hilbert action, as extended to all 5 dimensions.  The 4-D term dominates at short distances, and the 5-D term dominates at long distances.

The model was proposed in part in order to reproduce the cosmic acceleration of dark energy without any need for a small but non-zero vacuum energy density. But critics [ 2 ] argue that this branch of the theory is unstable. However, the theory remains interesting because of Dvali's claim that the unusual structure of the graviton propagator makes non-perturbative effects important in a seemingly linear regime, such as the Solar System . Because there is no four-dimensional, linearized effective theory that reproduces the DGP model for weak-field gravity, the theory avoids the vDVZ discontinuity that otherwise plagues attempts to write down a theory of massive gravity.

In 2008, Fang et al.

argued that recent cosmological observations (including measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey , and measurements of the cosmic microwave background and type 1a supernovae ) is in direct conflict with the DGP cosmology [ 3 ] unless a cosmological constant or some other form of dark energy is added.

[ 4 ] However, this negates the appeal of the DGP cosmology, which accelerates without needing to add dark energy.
