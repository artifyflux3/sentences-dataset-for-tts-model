' [coin] of Ptolemy ' Ptolemy ( Ancient Greek : Πτολεμαῖος , Ptolemaios ) is a male given name, derived from Ancient Greek and meaning 'warlike'.

[ 1 ] It is formed from the Epic Greek πτόλεμος ptolemos meaning 'war'.

[ 2 ] The name was used throughout the Greek world , but was particularly popular in ancient Macedon and its nobility. The earliest recorded use of the name is in the Iliad of Homer . During the Hellenistic period, Ptolemy I Soter , a general of Alexander the Great , founded the Ptolemaic dynasty which ruled their Kingdom in Ancient Egypt . All male rulers of the dynasty bore the name 'Ptolemy', the last being Ptolemy XII Auletes , father of Cleopatra . Common variants include Ptolemaeus (Latin), Tolomeo (Italian) and Talmai (Hebrew).

Etymology [ edit ] Ptolemy is the English form of the Ancient Greek name Πτολεμαῖος ( Ptolemaios ), a derivative of πτόλεμος , an Epic form of πόλεμος 'war' [ 3 ] [ note 1 ] and the suffix -αῖος -aios meaning 'pertaining' or 'belonging to'. A nephew of Antigonus I Monophthalmus was called Polemaeus , [ 4 ] the normal form of the adjective.

Ptolemaios is first attested in Homer 's Iliad and is the name of an Achaean warrior, son of Piraeus, father of Eurymedon.

[ 5 ] The name Ptolemaios varied over the years from its roots in ancient Greece , appearing in different languages in various forms and spellings: Ancient Greek : Πτολεμαῖος Ptolemaîos Latin : Ptolemaeus German : Ptolemäus, Ptolemaios Italian : Tolomeo English: Ptolemy Ancient Egyptian : ptwꜣrwmys Coptic : ⲡⲧⲟⲗⲉⲙⲁⲓⲟⲥ Ptolemaios Phoenician : 𐤐𐤕𐤋𐤌𐤉𐤎 (ptlmys) or 𐤐𐤕𐤋𐤌𐤉𐤔 (ptlmyš) Hebrew and Aramaic : תלמי (tlmy) Talmay Middle Persian 𐭯𐭲𐭫𐭬𐭥𐭱 (ptlmywš) Patlamyōš Persian : بَطلَمیوس، پتُلِمَیوس Baṭlamīūs/ Ptolemaios Arabic : بَطُلِيمُوس Baṭulīmūs The name Ptolemy spread from its Greek origins to enter other languages in Western Asia during the Hellenisation that followed the conquest of the known world by Alexander the Great .

The Aramaic name Bar- Talmai 'son of Talmai' (Greek Bartolomaios , English Bartholomew ) may be related ( Bartholomew the Apostle is thus thought to have been the son of a Ptolemy.)³ Ptolemais is formed from this name by the Greek feminine adjectival ending -i(d)s .

Claudius Ptolemaeus [ edit ] Ptolemy commonly refers to Claudius Ptolemaeus (ca. 90 AD–ca. 168 AD), a writer, geographer, mathematician, astronomer and astrologer who lived in the Alexandrine Greek culture of Roman Egypt.
