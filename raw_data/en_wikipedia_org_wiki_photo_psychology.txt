[ 1 ] Photopsychology traces several points of contact between photography and psychology.

[ 1 ] Many forms of photography have been used in psychology including, patient portrait photographs , [ 2 ] family photographs, [ 3 ] [ 4 ] ambiguous photographs [ 5 ] and photographers' photographs.

[ 6 ] Forms of psychological practices using photographs include photoanalysis, [ 3 ] phototherapy, [ 4 ] Walker Visuals, [ 5 ] and Reading Pictures.

[ 6 ] Timeline [ edit ] At the 111th APA convention in 2003, Joel Morgovsky, a photographer and retired psychology professor from Brookdale Community College , in Lincroft, New Jersey , alongside three other colleagues, presented a timeline of interactions between photography and psychology (see table below).

Diamond , a psychiatrist at the Surrey Asylum in Surrey County, England began taking photographs of his patients to aid in diagnosing and treating them.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] Since the portraits contained more information about his patients' levels of emotion than language , definitions , or classifications , they helped with more accurate diagnoses.

[ 2 ] [ 12 ] For example, mental suffering can be categorized under vague terms such as distress , sorrow , grief , melancholy, anguish , and despair , but a photograph speaks for itself, precisely identifying where the patient is on the scale of unhappiness.

[ 2 ] In sharing these portraits with the patients' themselves, Diamond found that the portraits can produce a positive effect on the patients, especially if successive portraits illustrate their progress to recovery.

[ 2 ] One case study conducted by Diamond revealed how a patient's portraits helped lead to a cure through providing an attainable outside perspective of reality.

[ 2 ] The patient suffered from delusions which consisted of supposed possession of great wealth and holding status of being a Queen .

[ 2 ] In seeing her portraits and her frequent conversations about them with her therapist, she was able to gradually let go of her former imagined status.

[ 2 ] In addition to helping diagnose and treat his patients, Diamond also suggested that these portraits could help in protection and clear representation of patients in case of readmission; similarly to how mug shots are helpful for prisons with improving certainty of previous conviction and in recapturing someone who might have escaped.

[ 2 ] Personal photographs [ edit ] Photoanalysis, proposed by Robert U. Akeret, is the study of body language in personal photographs (e.g. family photographs) to increase self-awareness , better understand interpersonal relationships , and more accurately recollect past episodic events .

[ 3 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] Phototherapy , like photoanalysis, is a therapeutic technique which analyzes personal photographs and the feelings , thoughts , memories , and associations these photos evoke, as a way to deepen insight and enhance communication during therapy session.

[ 4 ] [ 15 ] Currently, phototherapy is being practiced by Judy Weiser in Vancouver , Canada in the PhotoTherapy Center.

[ 4 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] Ambiguous photographs [ edit ] Walker Visuals, four 13" x 19" color, ambiguous, abstract, dreamlike , and evocative photographs, were created by psychiatrist and photographer, Joel Walker.

[ 5 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] Similarly to the Rorschach test , what is perceived when looking at these photographs depends on one's own history, expectations, needs , beliefs , feelings, and what happened just before viewing the image.

[ 5 ] [ 18 ] Walker created these images after observing how his patients responded to strange photos he had taken and displayed on his office wall.

[ 5 ] [ 17 ] From there, Walker expended his collection to include a range of themes from positive to negative.

[ 5 ] The images act as representations of his patient's inner world which allow them to better verbalize feelings and memories.

[ 5 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] Walker visuals can be used universally across culture, language, education , and class .

[ 5 ] Photographers' photographs [ edit ] Reading Pictures is the study of photographs as reflections of the makers' personal, subjective experiences .

[ 6 ] Morgovsky, a pioneer in Reading Pictures, established six fundamental mindsets needed for Reading Pictures: [ 6 ] [ 20 ] Overcoming The Illusion of Reality (OTIR): Understand that photographs are 2D representations , rather than reality.

[ 6 ] [ 20 ] The Rule of No Accidents (RNA): Everything in a photograph is there on purpose ; created when one makes the decision to expose a moment in time as a representation of a conscious experience.

[ 6 ] [ 20 ] Free Association (FA): An attitude of openness to projected, emotional content of photograph.

[ 6 ] [ 20 ] Attribution Process (AP): Guess the cause of observed behavior; ask questions like: "What does it mean that this person would take this particular photograph, of this subject matter, from this point of view, using these methods?".

[ 6 ] [ 20 ] This mindset was proposed by Fritz Heider and Harold Kelley.

[ 6 ] Thematic Analysis (TA): Analyze cognitive and emotional themes that run through collections of work to construct a working model of the photographer's experiential world.

[ 6 ] [ 20 ] Genre and Skill Level (GSL): Take into consideration genre and skill level.

[ 6 ] [ 20 ] Examples of genre include landscape , still-life , portraiture , documentary, straight, surreal, etc.

[ 6 ] [ 20 ] Skill level can be classified along levels of articulation (LOA): [ 6 ] [ 20 ] Innocent Photographers: camera owners who take pictures on an irregular basis for chronicling family events, vacations , and special moments.

[ 6 ] [ 20 ] They do not consider themselves photographers beyond a functional level and articulate themselves the least, but Reading Pictures can still be applied on the work innocents.

[ 6 ] [ 20 ] Amateur Photographers: people who enjoy photography, join photography societies, and obtain new and updated cameras, lenses, light sources, etc.

[ 6 ] [ 20 ] These photographers are less personally expressive, since they are often inspired to imitate work of other photographers they admire , and are masked by attempting to master a technical skill.

[ 6 ] [ 20 ] Mature Photographers: photographers that consciously use the medium as creative self-expression; they developed their own ways of seeing through the lens and have their own personal style, which is consistent through most of their work.

[ 6 ] [ 20 ] This group is the most articulate, so reading a few photos of theirs can provide insight into their personal cognitive and emotional experience.
