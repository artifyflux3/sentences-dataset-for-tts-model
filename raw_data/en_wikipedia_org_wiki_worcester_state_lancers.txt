Lancer Website worcester.edu Worcester State University ( WSU ) is a public university in Worcester, Massachusetts , United States. The fourth largest of the Commonwealth’s nine Universities, WSU enrolls over 4800 undergraduates and nearly 900 graduate students in more than 80 undergraduate majors and minors and 32 graduate programs.

WSU was one of several Massachusetts State Universities that was founded as a normal school in the 19th century before evolving into a state college in the 1960s and achieving university status in 2012. WSU is administered by the Massachusetts Department of Higher Education which oversees 29 campuses including community colleges, state universities, and research universities across the Commonwealth.

History [ edit ] View of the original Worcester State Normal School c.

1890 Founded in 1874 as the Massachusetts State Normal School at Worcester , WSU was the fifth of nine teacher training colleges in the state.

[ 3 ] Spurred by the success of a city-run normal school founded two years earlier, its school committee successfully petitioned the Massachusetts General Court for a state-sponsored institution in Worcester .

[ 4 ] The original campus was located in a Second Empire -style stone building on St. Ann's Hill, near the city's downtown. By 1900, the campus included a president's house, the "Stoddard Terrace" residence hall, and a turreted gymnasium annex. This site would serve WSU for nearly sixty years until the current Chandler Street campus opened in 1932.

[ 5 ] The first "principal" of WSU, Elias Harlow Russell (1874–1909), shaped the school's early curriculum. A pioneer in the Child Study Movement that emphasized childhood development and educational reform efforts, Russell partnered with colleague G. Stanley Hall , who later became President of Clark University , to develop a program that placed normal school students in city schools.

[ 6 ] Russell was later succeeded by Francis Randsom Lane (1909–1912).

In the 1920s, WSU followed national trends in teacher education by introducing a broader array of college courses and a Bachelor of Science in Education degree in 1921 culminating in a new designation of Worcester State Teachers College in 1932.

[ 7 ] The Great Depression threatened the College as the state proposed cost-cutting measures that would eliminate many schools.

[ 8 ] Presidents William B. Aspinwall (1912–1940) and Clinton E. Carpenter (1940–1946) led the college through this crisis and set the stage for post-war development under the presidency of Eugene A. Sullivan (1947–1970).

[ 9 ] President Sullivan oversaw the expansion of the WSU curriculum. In 1952, the college introduced a Master of Science in Education, and in 1963, a Bachelor of Arts degree. In 1960 the school was designated Worcester State College . Sullivan also oversaw the development of a collegiate athletic system, introducing varsity sports in 1950 and constructing a new gymnasium building in 1958.

[ 10 ] President Robert E. Leestamper (1970–1975), further expanded graduate programs and introduced professional programs such as nursing and business. In 1973, Chandler Village was created as the first residence halls on the Chandler Street campus.

[ 11 ] The tenure of presidents Joseph J. Orze (1975–1982) and Phillip D. Vario (1982–1992) expanded the campus with the addition of a student center and a new residence hall, named Dowden Hall, as well as continued support of varsity sports and degree offerings in speech and occupational therapy.

[ 12 ] Under the tenure of President Vario, the school joined the Coalition of Urban and Metropolitan Universities . The Worcester State Foundation was created in 1994, during the presidency of Kaylan K. Ghosh (1992–2002), to support school fundraising efforts. During the following decade, the campus grew to include the new Ghosh Science and Technology Center, as well as an additional residence hall and parking structure, which was built during the tenure of President Janelle C. Ashley (2002–2011).

[ 13 ] In 2010, WSU reorganized into two schools: the School of Humanities and Social Sciences and the School of Education, Health, and Natural Sciences. That same year, the state granted Massachusetts State Colleges university status and the college became the Worcester State University .

[ 14 ] In 2011, Worcester State installed its eleventh president, Barry M. Maloney.

[ 15 ] That same year, students and faculty relaunched the Worcester Spy , a newspaper originally founded in 1775.

At the end of the 2020–2021 academic year, nearby Becker College closed, and transferred custody of their academic records to WSU.

[ 16 ] Campus [ edit ] WSU is located on Chandler Street in the Tatnuck neighborhood of Worcester. The 58-acre campus includes woods and wetlands, and features several buildings constructed on a steep, east-facing slope.

In the late nineteenth century, the campus was the site of "Willow Farm", home of William Sever Lincoln (1811–1889), who led the 34th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment during the American Civil War and was brevetted Brigadier General in 1865.

[ 17 ] He was the son of Levi Lincoln Jr.

, former Governor of Massachusetts . The property was later purchased by Worcester industrialist George I. Rockwood for whom Worcester's Rockwood Field, adjacent to WSU's campus, is named.

[ 18 ] In 1930, the farm was acquired for WSU's new campus and, in 1942, an additional thirty-five acres were added, forming the campus's current boundaries . Today, about thirty-percent of full-time students reside on campus.
