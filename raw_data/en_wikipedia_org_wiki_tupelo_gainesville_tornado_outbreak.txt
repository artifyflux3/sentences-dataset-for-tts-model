rating 1 F5 tornado Duration of tornado outbreak 2 18 hours Fatalities ≥ 454 fatalities, >2,498 injuries Damage ≥ $15.9 million (1936 USD ) ≥ $360 million (2024 USD) Areas affected Southern United States 1 Most severe tornado damage; see Fujita scale 2 Time from first tornado to last tornado On April 5–6, 1936, an outbreak of at least 14 tornadoes struck the Southeastern United States , killing at least 454 people (with 419 of those deaths caused by just two tornadoes) and injuring at least 2,500 others. Over 200 people died in Georgia alone, making it the deadliest disaster ever recorded in the state.

[ 1 ] Although the outbreak is often centered on the violent tornadoes in Tupelo, Mississippi (with an estimated F5 rating ), and Gainesville, Georgia (estimated F4 rating ), there were other destructive tornadoes in the cities of Columbia, Tennessee ; Acworth, Georgia ; and Anderson, South Carolina . One long-track F4 tornado killed six people in rural parts of Tennessee, and two other long-track tornadoes (rated F3) killed an additional 13 people in southern Tennessee and northern Alabama. Another pair of F3 tornadoes touched down in Mississippi, claiming an additional eight lives.

This is the second deadliest tornado outbreak in U.S. history (after that of the Tri-state tornado in 1925) and the only one in which two separate tornadoes killed more than 200 people each.

rating 1 F5 tornado Fatalities ≥ 216 fatalities, ≥ 700 injuries Damage $3 million (1936 USD) $79.3 million (2024 USD) 1 Most severe tornado damage; see Fujita scale Making its way toward Tupelo, the massive tornado killed a family of 13 as their house was swept away, and injured many more before reaching Tupelo's west side. Retroactively rated F5 on the modern Fujita scale , it caused total destruction along its path through the Willis Heights neighborhood. Dozens of large and well built mansions were swept completely away in this area. Although missing the business district , the tornado moved through the residential areas of north Tupelo, destroying many homes, and killing whole families. The Gum Pond area of Tupelo was the worst hit. Homes along the pond were swept into the water with their victims. The majority of the bodies were found in Gum Pond, the area which is now Gumtree Park. Reportedly, many bodies were never recovered from the pond. Reports were that the winds were so strong, pine needles were embedded into trunks of trees. As the tornado exited the city's east side, the large concrete Battle of Tupelo monument was toppled to the ground and destroyed. Two nearby brick gate posts were broken off at the base and blown over as well. East of town, granulated structural debris from the city was strewn and wind-rowed for miles through open fields. According to records, the Tupelo tornado leveled 48 city blocks and between 200–900 homes, killing at least 216 people and injuring at least 700 others. The tornado destroyed the water tower and produced numerous fires in its wake, though overnight rains which left knee-deep water in some streets contained the flames. Though 216 remained the final death toll, 100 persons were still hospitalized at the time it was set. Subsequently, the Mississippi State Geologist estimated a final, unofficial death toll of 233. Notably, among the survivors were one-year-old Elvis Presley and his parents.

rating 1 F4 tornado Fatalities ≥ 203 fatalities, ≥ 1,600 injuries Damage $12 1 ⁄ 2 million (1936 USD) $283 million (2024 USD) 1 Most severe tornado damage; see Fujita scale After producing the Tupelo tornado, the storm system moved through Alabama overnight and reached Gainesville, Georgia, at around 8:30 a.m local standard time . According to Ted Fujita , this early morning tornado was a double tornado event: one tornado moved in from the Atlanta highway, while the other moved in from the Dawsonville highway. The two merged on Grove Street and destroyed everything throughout the downtown area, causing wreckage to pile 10 feet (3.0 m ) high in some places. The worst tornado-caused death toll in a single building in U.S. history was at the Cooper Pants Factory.

[ 21 ] President Franklin D. Roosevelt spoke from a train platform in Gainesville on April 9, after the devastating tornado struck the town a few days earlier.

[ 22 ] See also [ edit ] 1903 Gainesville, Georgia, tornado — Also devastated part of the same city as in 1936 Notes [ edit ] ^ An outbreak is generally defined as a group of at least six tornadoes (the number sometimes varies slightly according to local climatology) with no more than a six-hour gap between individual tornadoes. An outbreak sequence , prior to (after) the start of modern records in 1950, is defined as a period of no more than two (one) consecutive days without at least one significant (F2 or stronger) tornado.

[ 3 ] ^ The Fujita scale was devised under the aegis of scientist T. Theodore Fujita in the early 1970s. Prior to the advent of the scale in 1971, tornadoes in the United States were officially unrated.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] While the Fujita scale has been superseded by the Enhanced Fujita scale in the U.S. since February 1, 2007, [ 6 ] Canada used the old scale until April 1, 2013; [ 7 ] nations elsewhere, like the United Kingdom, apply other classifications such as the TORRO scale .

[ 8 ] ^ Historically, the number of tornadoes globally and in the United States was and is likely underrepresented: research by Grazulis on annual tornado activity suggests that, as of 2001, only 53% of yearly U.S. tornadoes were officially recorded. Documentation of tornadoes outside the United States was historically less exhaustive, owing to the lack of monitors in many nations and, in some cases, to internal political controls on public information.

[ 9 ] Most countries only recorded tornadoes that produced severe damage or loss of life.

[ 10 ] Significant low biases in U.S. tornado counts likely occurred through the early 1990s, when advanced NEXRAD was first installed and the National Weather Service began comprehensively verifying tornado occurrences.

[ 11 ] ^ a b All dates are based on the local time zone where the tornado touched down; however, all times are in Coordinated Universal Time and dates are split at midnight CST/CDT for consistency.

^ a b Prior to 1994, only the average widths of tornado paths were officially listed.
