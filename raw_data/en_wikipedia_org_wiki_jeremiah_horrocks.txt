**Jeremiah Horrocks** (1618– 3 January 1641), sometimes given as **Jeremiah Horrox** (the [Latinised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Latinised_names "List of Latinised names") version that he used on the Emmanuel College register and in his Latin manuscripts),[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremiah_Horrocks#cite_note-Marston-2) was an English [astronomer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomer "Astronomer").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremiah_Horrocks#cite_note-3) He was the first person to demonstrate that the [Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon "Moon") moved around the [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth") in an elliptical orbit; and he was the only person to predict the [transit of Venus of 1639](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transit_of_Venus,_1639 "Transit of Venus, 1639"), an event which he and his friend [William Crabtree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Crabtree "William Crabtree") were the only two people to observe and record. Most remarkably, Horrocks correctly asserted that Jupiter was accelerating in its orbit while Saturn was slowing and interpreted this as due to mutual gravitational interaction, thereby demonstrating that gravity's actions were not limited to the Earth, Sun, and Moon.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremiah_Horrocks#cite_note-Hecht-4)

His early death and the chaos of the [English Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Civil_War "English Civil War") nearly caused the loss to science of his treatise on the transit, _Venus in sole visa_; but for this and his other work he is acknowledged as one of the founding fathers of British astronomy.

Early life and education
------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jeremiah_Horrocks&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Early life and education")]

Jeremiah Horrocks was born at Lower Lodge Farm in [Toxteth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxteth "Toxteth") Park, a former [royal deer park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_deer_park "Medieval deer park") near [Liverpool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool "Liverpool"), Lancashire.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremiah_Horrocks#cite_note-Aughton_2004_18-5) His father James had moved to Toxteth Park to be apprenticed to Thomas Aspinwall, a [watchmaker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmaker "Watchmaker"), and subsequently married his master's daughter Mary. Both families were well educated [Puritans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puritan "Puritan"); the Horrocks sent their younger sons to the [University of Cambridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge "University of Cambridge") and the Aspinwalls favoured [Oxford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Oxford "University of Oxford").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremiah_Horrocks#cite_note-6) For their unorthodox beliefs the Puritans were excluded from public office, which tended to push them towards other callings; by 1600 the Aspinwalls had become a successful family of watchmakers.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremiah_Horrocks#cite_note-Aughton_2004_18-5) Jeremiah was introduced early to astronomy; his boyhood chores included measuring the local noon used to set local clocks,[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremiah_Horrocks#cite_note-7) and his Puritan upbringing instilled an enduring suspicion of [astrology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrology "Astrology"), [witchcraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witchcraft "Witchcraft") and [magic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_(paranormal) "Magic (paranormal)").[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremiah_Horrocks#cite_note-8)

In 1632, Horrocks [matriculated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matriculation "Matriculation") at [Emmanuel College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_College,_Cambridge "Emmanuel College, Cambridge") at the [University of Cambridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge "University of Cambridge") as a [sizar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sizar "Sizar"). At Cambridge he associated with the mathematician [John Wallis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wallis "John Wallis") and the [platonist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Platonists "Cambridge Platonists")[John Worthington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Worthington_(academic) "John Worthington (academic)"). At that time he was one of only a few at Cambridge to accept [Copernicus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copernicus "Copernicus")'s revolutionary [heliocentric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentric "Heliocentric") theory, and he studied the works of [Johannes Kepler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Kepler "Johannes Kepler"), [Tycho Brahe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tycho_Brahe "Tycho Brahe") and others.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremiah_Horrocks#cite_note-9)

In 1635, for reasons not clear, Horrocks left Cambridge without graduating.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremiah_Horrocks#cite_note-10) Marston suggests that he may have needed to defer the extra cost this entailed until he was employed,[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremiah_Horrocks#cite_note-Marston-2) whilst Aughton speculates that he may have failed his exams due to concentrating too much on his own interests, or that he did not want to take [Anglican orders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_orders "Holy orders"), and so a degree was of limited use to him.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremiah_Horrocks#cite_note-11)

Astronomical observations
-------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jeremiah_Horrocks&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Astronomical observations")]

Now committed to the study of astronomy, Horrocks began to collect astronomical books and equipment; by 1638 he owned the best telescope he could find. Liverpool was a seafaring town so navigational instruments such as the [astrolabe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrolabe "Astrolabe") and [cross staff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_staff "Cross staff") were easy to find. But there was no market for the very specialised astronomical instruments he needed, so his only option was to make his own. He was well placed to do this; his father and uncles were watchmakers with expertise in creating precise instruments. Apparently he helped with the family business by day and, in return, the watchmakers in his family supported his vocation by assisting in the design and construction of instruments to study the stars at night.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremiah_Horrocks#cite_note-12)

Horrocks owned a three-foot _radius astronomicus_ – a cross staff with movable sights used to measure the angle between two stars – but by January 1637 he had reached the limitations of this instrument and so built a larger and higher precision version.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremiah_Horrocks#cite_note-13) While a youth he read most of the astronomical treatises of his day and marked their weaknesses; by the age of seventeen he was suggesting new lines of research.

Tradition has it that after he left home he supported himself by holding a [curacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curate "Curate") in [Much Hoole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Much_Hoole "Much Hoole"), near [Preston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preston,_Lancashire "Preston, Lancashire") in Lancashire, but there is little evidence for this.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremiah_Horrocks#cite_note-Marston-2) According to local tradition in Much Hoole, he lived at [Carr House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carr_House_(Bretherton,_Lancashire,_England) "Carr House (Bretherton, Lancashire, England)"), within the [Bank Hall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_Hall "Bank Hall") Estate, [Bretherton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretherton "Bretherton"). Carr House was a substantial property owned by the Stones family who were prosperous farmers and merchants, and Horrocks was probably a tutor for the Stones' children.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremiah_Horrocks#cite_note-Httpwwwlancashirepioneerscomhorrocksimagesasp-14)

Horrocks was the first to demonstrate that the [Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon "Moon") moved in an elliptical path around the [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth"), and he posited that comets followed elliptical orbits. He supported his theories by analogy to the motions of a conical pendulum, noting that after a plumb bob was drawn back and released it followed an elliptical path, and that its major axis rotated in the direction of revolution as did the [apsides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsides "Apsides") of the Moon's orbit.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremiah_Horrocks#cite_note-JOC/EFR-15) He anticipated [Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton") in suggesting the influence of the Sun as well as the Earth on the Moon's orbit. In the _[Principia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophiae\_Naturalis\_Principia\_Mathematica "Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica")_[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremiah_Horrocks#cite_note-16) Newton acknowledged Horrocks's work in relation to his theory of lunar motion. In the final months of his life Horrocks made detailed studies of [tides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tides "Tides") in attempting to explain the nature of lunar causation of tidal movements.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremiah_Horrocks#cite_note-17)

The title page of Jeremiah Horrocks' _Opera Posthuma,_ published by the [Royal Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Society "Royal Society") in 1672.

[Johannes Kepler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Kepler "Johannes Kepler") had published his [Rudolphine Tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolphine_Tables "Rudolphine Tables") in 1627. Two years later he published extracts from the tables in his pamphlet _De raris mirisque Anni 1631_, which included an _admonitio ad astronomos_ (warning to astronomers) concerning a [transit of Mercury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transit_of_Mercury "Transit of Mercury") in 1631 and transits of Venus in 1631 and 1761.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremiah_Horrocks#cite_note-Utrecht-18) Horrocks' own observations, combined with those of his friend and correspondent [William Crabtree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Crabtree "William Crabtree"), had convinced him that Kepler's Rudolphine tables, although more accurate than the commonly used tables produced by [Philip Van Lansberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Van_Lansberg "Philip Van Lansberg"), were still in need of some correction. Kepler's tables had predicted a near-miss of a transit of [Venus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus "Venus") in 1639 but, having made his own observations of [Venus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus "Venus") for years, Horrocks predicted a transit would indeed occur.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremiah_Horrocks#cite_note-UCLAN-19)

Horrocks made a simple [helioscope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helioscope "Helioscope") by focusing the image of the Sun through a [telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telescope "Telescope") onto a plane surface, whereby an image of the Sun could be safely observed. From his location in [Much Hoole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Much_Hoole "Much Hoole") he calculated the transit would begin at approximately 3:00 pm on 24 November 1639, [Julian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_calendar "Julian calendar") (or 4 December in the [Gregorian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar "Gregorian calendar")). The weather was cloudy but he first observed the tiny black shadow of Venus crossing the Sun at about 3:15 pm; and he continued to observe for half an hour until the Sun set. The 1639 transit was also observed by William Crabtree from his home in [Broughton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broughton,_Salford "Broughton, Salford") near [Manchester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester "Manchester").

Horrocks' observations allowed him to make a well-informed guess as to the size of Venus—previously thought to be larger and closer to Earth—and to estimate the distance between the [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth") and the Sun, now known as the [astronomical unit (AU)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit "Astronomical unit"). His figure of 95 million kilometres (59 million miles, 0.63 AU) was far from the 150 million kilometres (93 million miles) known today, but it was more accurate than any suggested up to that time.

A treatise by Horrocks on the study of the transit, _Venus in sole visa_ (_Venus seen on the Sun_), was later published by the Polish astronomer [Johannes Hevelius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Hevelius "Johannes Hevelius") at his own expense; it caused great excitement when revealed to members of the [Royal Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Society "Royal Society") in 1662, some 20 years after it was written. It presented Horrocks' enthusiastic and romantic nature, including humorous comments and passages of original poetry. When speaking of the century separating Venusian transits, he rhapsodised:

" ...Thy return Posterity shall witness; years must roll Away, but then at length the splendid sight Again shall greet our distant children's eyes."
It was a time of great uncertainty in astronomy, when the world's astronomers could not agree amongst themselves and theologians fulminated against claims that contradicted Scripture. Horrocks, although a pious young man, came down firmly on the side of [scientific determinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_determinism "Scientific determinism").[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremiah_Horrocks#cite_note-Plummer-20)

> It is wrong to hold the most noble Science of the Stars guilty of uncertainty on account of some people's uncertain observations. Through no fault of its own it suffers these complaints which arise from the uncertainty and error not of the celestial motions but of human observations . . . I do not consider that any imperfections in the motions of the stars have so far been detected, nor do I believe that they are ever to be found. Far be it from me to allow that God has created the heavenly bodies more imperfectly than man has observed them.  – Jeremiah Horrocks[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremiah_Horrocks#cite_note-Plummer-20)

Horrocks returned to Toxteth Park sometime in mid-1640 and died suddenly from unknown causes on 3 January 1641, at the age of 22. As expressed by Crabtree, "What an incalculable loss!"[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremiah_Horrocks#cite_note-21) He has been described as a bridge which connected [Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton") with [Copernicus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Copernicus "Nicolaus Copernicus"), [Galileo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei "Galileo Galilei"), [Brahe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tycho_Brahe "Tycho Brahe") and [Kepler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Kepler "Johannes Kepler").[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremiah_Horrocks#cite_note-22)

It is believed that Horrocks was buried at [Toxteth Unitarian Chapel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxteth_Unitarian_Chapel "Toxteth Unitarian Chapel"), but there is seemingly no proof of this.

Sculpture commemorating Horrocks at the Pier Head, Liverpool

Horrocks is remembered on a plaque in [Westminster Abbey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_Abbey "Westminster Abbey")[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremiah_Horrocks#cite_note-23) and the lunar crater [Horrocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horrocks_(crater) "Horrocks (crater)") is named after him. In 1859, a marble tablet and stained-glass windows commemorating him were installed in the Parish Church of St Michael, Much Hoole.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremiah_Horrocks#cite_note-Httpwwwlancashirepioneerscomhorrocksimagesasp-14) Toxteth Unitarian Chapel contains a memorial plaque commemorating his achievements.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremiah_Horrocks#cite_note-24) Horrocks Avenue in Garston, Liverpool, is also named after him.

In 1927, the Jeremiah Horrocks Observatory was built at [Moor Park, Preston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moor_Park,_Preston "Moor Park, Preston").[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremiah_Horrocks#cite_note-25)

The 2012 transit of Venus was marked by a celebration held in the church at Much Hoole, which was streamed live worldwide on the NASA website.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremiah_Horrocks#cite_note-26)

Horrocks and the transit of Venus feature in an episode ("Dark Matter") of the British television series _[Lewis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis\_(TV\_series) "Lewis (TV series)")_.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremiah_Horrocks#cite_note-27)

In 2011, a sculpture by Andy Plant, titled _Heaven and Earth_, was installed at the [Pier Head](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pier_Head "Pier Head") in Liverpool to celebrate Horrocks's work on the transit of Venus. It consists of a telescope looking at a working [orrery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orrery "Orrery") which has the planet Venus replaced by a figure of the astronomer depicted as an angel.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremiah_Horrocks#cite_note-28)

In 2023 a new play, _Horrox_ on Horrocks' short life and overlooked achievements, by playwright David Sear, was staged in Cambridge’s [ADC Theatre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADC_Theatre "ADC Theatre") from 28 March to 1 April as part of the Cambridge festival.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremiah_Horrocks#cite_note-Grdn-29)

### Jeremiah Horrocks Institute

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jeremiah_Horrocks&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Jeremiah Horrocks Institute")]

The Jeremiah Horrocks Institute for Astrophysics and Supercomputing was established in 1993 at the [University of Central Lancashire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Central_Lancashire "University of Central Lancashire").[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremiah_Horrocks#cite_note-30) In 2012 it was renamed the Jeremiah Horrocks Institute for Mathematics, Physics, and Astronomy.
