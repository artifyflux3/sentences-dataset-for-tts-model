More abstractly, it is a quadratic functional on the Sobolev space H 1 .  The Dirichlet energy is intimately connected to Laplace's equation and is named after the German mathematician Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet .

Definition [ edit ] Given an open set Ω ⊆ R n and a differentiable function u : Ω → R , the Dirichlet energy of the function u is the real number E [ u ] = 1 2 ∫ ∫ Ω Ω ‖ ‖ ∇ ∇ u ( x ) ‖ ‖ 2 d x , {\displaystyle E[u]={\frac {1}{2}}\int _{\Omega }\|\nabla u(x)\|^{2}\,dx,} where ∇ u : Ω → R n denotes the gradient vector field of the function u .

Properties and applications [ edit ] Since it is the integral of a non-negative quantity, the Dirichlet energy is itself non-negative, i.e.

E [ u ] ≥ 0 for every function u .

Solving Laplace's equation − − Δ Δ u ( x ) = 0 {\displaystyle -\Delta u(x)=0} for all x ∈ ∈ Ω Ω {\displaystyle x\in \Omega } , subject to appropriate boundary conditions , is equivalent to solving the variational problem of finding a function u that satisfies the boundary conditions and has minimal Dirichlet energy.

Such a solution is called a harmonic function and such solutions are the topic of study in potential theory .

In a more general setting, where Ω ⊆ R n is replaced by any Riemannian manifold M , and u : Ω → R is replaced by u : M → Φ for another (different) Riemannian manifold Φ , the Dirichlet energy is given by the sigma model . The solutions to the Lagrange equations for the sigma model Lagrangian are those functions u that minimize/maximize the Dirichlet energy. Restricting this general case back to the specific case of u : Ω → R just shows that the Lagrange equations (or, equivalently, the Hamilton–Jacobi equations ) provide the basic tools for obtaining extremal solutions.
