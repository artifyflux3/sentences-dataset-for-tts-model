The real line with the point at infinity; it is called the [real projective line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_projective_line "Real projective line").

In [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry"), a **point at infinity** or **ideal point** is an idealized limiting point at the "end" of each line.

In the case of an [affine plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_plane "Affine plane") (including the [Euclidean plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_plane "Euclidean plane")), there is one ideal point for each [pencil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pencil_(mathematics) "Pencil (mathematics)") of parallel lines of the plane. Adjoining these points produces a [projective plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_plane "Projective plane"), in which no point can be distinguished, if we "forget" which points were added. This holds for a geometry over any [field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics) "Field (mathematics)"), and more generally over any [division ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_ring "Division ring").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_at_infinity#cite_note-mathworld-1)

In the real case, a point at infinity completes a line into a topologically closed curve. In higher dimensions, all the points at infinity form a projective subspace of one dimension less than that of the whole projective space to which they belong. A point at infinity can also be added to the [complex line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_line "Complex line") (which may be thought of as the complex plane), thereby turning it into a closed surface known as the complex projective line, **C**P 1, also called the [Riemann sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_sphere "Riemann sphere") (when complex numbers are mapped to each point).

In the case of a [hyperbolic space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_space "Hyperbolic space"), each line has two distinct [ideal points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_point "Ideal point"). Here, the set of ideal points takes the form of a [quadric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadric_(projective_geometry) "Quadric (projective geometry)").

In an [affine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_space "Affine space") or [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space") of higher dimension, the **points at infinity** are the points which are added to the space to get the [projective completion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_space "Projective space").[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] The set of the points at infinity is called, depending on the dimension of the space, the [line at infinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_at_infinity "Line at infinity"), the [plane at infinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_at_infinity "Plane at infinity") or the [hyperplane at infinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplane_at_infinity "Hyperplane at infinity"), in all cases a projective space of one less dimension.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_at_infinity#cite_note-atinfinity-2)

As a projective space over a field is a [smooth algebraic variety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_algebraic_variety "Smooth algebraic variety"), the same is true for the set of points at infinity. Similarly, if the ground field is the real or the complex field, the set of points at infinity is a [manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold "Manifold").

In artistic drawing and technical perspective, the projection on the picture plane of the point at infinity of a class of parallel lines is called their [vanishing point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanishing_point "Vanishing point").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_at_infinity#cite_note-vanishing-3)

Hyperbolic geometry
-------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Point_at_infinity&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Hyperbolic geometry")]

In [hyperbolic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry "Hyperbolic geometry"), **points at infinity** are typically named [ideal points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_point "Ideal point").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_at_infinity#cite_note-hyperbolic-4) Unlike [Euclidean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry "Euclidean geometry") and [elliptic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_geometry "Elliptic geometry") geometries, each line has two points at infinity: given a line _l_ and a point _P_ not on _l_, the right- and left-[limiting parallels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limiting_parallel "Limiting parallel")[converge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergence_(mathematics) "Convergence (mathematics)")[asymptotically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptotically "Asymptotically") to different points at infinity.

All points at infinity together form the [Cayley absolute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayley_absolute "Cayley absolute") or boundary of a [hyperbolic plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_plane "Hyperbolic plane").

Projective geometry
-------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Point_at_infinity&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Projective geometry")]

A symmetry of points and lines arises in a projective plane: just as a pair of points determine a line, so a pair of lines determine a point. The existence of parallel lines leads to establishing a point at infinity which represents the intersection of these parallels. This axiomatic symmetry grew out of a study of [graphical perspective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_perspective "Graphical perspective") where a [parallel projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_projection "Parallel projection") arises as a [central projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_projection "Central projection") where the center _C_ is a point at infinity, or **figurative point**.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_at_infinity#cite_note-figurative-5) The axiomatic symmetry of points and lines is called [duality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duality_(projective_geometry) "Duality (projective geometry)").

Though a point at infinity is considered on a par with any other point of a [projective range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_range "Projective range"), in the representation of points with [projective coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_coordinates "Projective coordinates"), distinction is noted: finite points are represented with a 1 in the final coordinate while a point at infinity has a 0 there. The need to represent points at infinity requires that one extra coordinate beyond the space of finite points is needed.

Other generalizations
---------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Point_at_infinity&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Other generalizations")]

This construction can be generalized to [topological spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space "Topological space"). Different compactifications may exist for a given space, but arbitrary topological space admits [Alexandroff extension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandroff_extension "Alexandroff extension"), also called the _one-point [compactification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compactification\_(mathematics) "Compactification (mathematics)")_ when the original space is not itself [compact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space "Compact space"). Projective line (over arbitrary field) is the Alexandroff extension of the corresponding field. Thus, the circle is the one-point compactification of the [real line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_line "Real line"), and the sphere is the one-point compactification of the plane. [Projective spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_space "Projective space")**P**n for n>1 are not _one-point_ compactifications of corresponding affine spaces for the reason mentioned above under [§Affine geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_at_infinity#Affine_geometry), and completions of hyperbolic spaces with ideal points are also not one-point compactifications.
