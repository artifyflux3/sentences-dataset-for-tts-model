UNCOVER-z12 is within the Abell 2744 supercluster in the constellation Sculptor .

[ 3 ] It is the 5th-most distant object ever discovered as of 2024, and is estimated to be 32.21 giga-lightyears from Earth.

Morphology [ edit ] UNCOVER-z12 is a Lyman-Break galaxy . Due to the recent discovery date, not much more is known about the galaxy itself.

[ 3 ] Discovery [ edit ] UNCOVER-z12 was first observed when large amounts of gravitational lensing from Abell 2744 made the galaxy visible. Abell 2744 is around 3.5 billion light-years away from the Milky Way .

[ 4 ] The gravity of Abell 2744 warps the fabric of space-time sufficiently to magnify the light of more faraway galaxies. The James Webb Space Telescope used the gravitational lensing to discover UNCOVER-z12, and further studies of deep galaxies located within Abell 2744 are currently ongoing.

[ 4 ] UNCOVER-z13 [ edit ] UNCOVER-z13 is a second, more far-away galaxy that was located on November 14, 2023, using the same systems.

[ 5 ] It has a redshift of 13, making it the 3rd most distant object ever discovered in the observable universe.
