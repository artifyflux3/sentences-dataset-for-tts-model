In string theory and related theories (such as supergravity ), a brane is a physical object that generalizes the notion of a zero- dimensional point particle , a one-dimensional string , or a two-dimensional membrane to higher-dimensional objects. Branes are dynamical objects which can propagate through spacetime according to the rules of quantum mechanics . They have mass and can have other attributes such as charge .

Mathematically, branes can be represented within categories , and are studied in pure mathematics for insight into homological mirror symmetry and noncommutative geometry .

The word "brane" originated in 1987 as a contraction of " membrane ".

[ 1 ] p -branes [ edit ] A point particle is a 0-brane, of dimension zero; a string, named after vibrating musical strings , is a 1-brane; a membrane, named after vibrating membranes such as drumheads , is a 2-brane.

[ 2 ] The corresponding object of arbitrary dimension p is called a p -brane, a term coined by M. J. Duff et al.

in 1988.

[ 3 ] A p -brane sweeps out a ( p +1)-dimensional volume in spacetime called its worldvolume . Physicists often study fields analogous to the electromagnetic field , which live on the worldvolume of a brane.

[ 4 ] D-branes [ edit ] Main article: D-brane Open strings attached to a pair of D-branes In string theory , a string may be open (forming a segment with two endpoints) or closed (forming a closed loop).

D-branes are an important class of branes that arise when one considers open strings. As an open string propagates through spacetime, its endpoints are required to lie on a D-brane. The letter "D" in D-brane refers to the Dirichlet boundary condition , which the D-brane satisfies.

[ 5 ] One crucial point about D-branes is that the dynamics on the D-brane worldvolume is described by a gauge theory , a kind of highly symmetric physical theory which is also used to describe the behavior of elementary particles in the standard model of particle physics . This connection has led to important insights into gauge theory and quantum field theory . For example, it led to the discovery of the AdS/CFT correspondence , a theoretical tool that physicists use to translate difficult problems in gauge theory into more mathematically tractable problems in string theory.

[ 6 ] Categorical description [ edit ] Mathematically, branes can be described using the notion of a category .

[ 7 ] This is a mathematical structure consisting of objects , and for any pair of objects, a set of morphisms between them. In most examples, the objects are mathematical structures (such as sets , vector spaces , or topological spaces ) and the morphisms are functions between these structures.

[ 8 ] One can likewise consider categories where the objects are D-branes and the morphisms between two branes α α {\displaystyle \alpha } and β β {\displaystyle \beta } are states of open strings stretched between α α {\displaystyle \alpha } and β β {\displaystyle \beta } .

[ 9 ] A cross section of a Calabi–Yau manifold In one version of string theory known as the topological B-model , the D-branes are complex submanifolds of certain six-dimensional shapes called Calabi–Yau manifolds , together with additional data that arise physically from having charges at the endpoints of strings.

[ 10 ] Intuitively, one can think of a submanifold as a surface embedded inside of a Calabi–Yau manifold, although submanifolds can also exist in dimensions different from two.

[ 11 ] In mathematical language, the category having these branes as its objects is known as the derived category of coherent sheaves on the Calabi–Yau.

[ 12 ] In another version of string theory called the topological A-model , the D-branes can again be viewed as submanifolds of a Calabi–Yau manifold. Roughly speaking, they are what mathematicians call special Lagrangian submanifolds .

[ 13 ] This means, among other things, that they have half the dimension of the space in which they sit, and they are length-, area-, or volume-minimizing.

[ 14 ] The category having these branes as its objects is called the Fukaya category .

[ 15 ] The derived category of coherent sheaves is constructed using tools from complex geometry , a branch of mathematics that describes geometric shapes in algebraic terms and solves geometric problems using algebraic equations .

[ 16 ] On the other hand, the Fukaya category is constructed using symplectic geometry , a branch of mathematics that arose from studies of classical physics . Symplectic geometry studies spaces equipped with a symplectic form , a mathematical tool that can be used to compute area in two-dimensional examples.

[ 17 ] The homological mirror symmetry conjecture of Maxim Kontsevich states that the derived category of coherent sheaves on one Calabi–Yau manifold is equivalent in a certain sense to the Fukaya category of a completely different Calabi–Yau manifold.

[ 18 ] This equivalence provides an unexpected bridge between two branches of geometry, namely complex and symplectic geometry.
