"There is no single United Nations Agency, Fund or Programme dedicated exclusively to water issues. In fact, over 30 United Nations organizations carry out water and sanitation programmes because these issues run through all of the United Nations’ main focus areas." [ 2 ] UN-Water's role is to ensure the UN "delivers as one" in response to water-related challenges, providing effective support to countries in their work towards internally-agreed water-related goals and targets, such as the Sustainable Development Goal 6 on water and sanitation.

UN-Water led the development of the first UN System-wide Strategy for Water and Sanitation , launched in 2024, through which UN entities have committed to uniting their efforts and maximizing the collective strength of the UN system to support countries to make faster and greater progress on water and sanitation.

[ 3 ] The majority of UN-Water's offices are located in Geneva , Switzerland.

Issues [ edit ] Water is at the core of sustainable development and is critical for socio-economic development, healthy ecosystems and for human survival itself. Water is vital for reducing the global burden of disease and improving the health, welfare and productivity of populations. Today, 2.2 billion people lack access to safely managed drinking water services and 3.5 billion people lack safely managed sanitation services.

[ 4 ] Water is also at the heart of adaptation to climate change , serving as the crucial link between the climate system, human society and the environment. Without proper water governance , there is likely to be increased competition for water between sectors and an escalation of water crises of various kinds, triggering emergencies in a range of water-dependent sectors.

Water scarcity is a significant issue around the world. Approximately 10% of the global population – around 720 million people – lived in countries with high and critical water stress levels in 2021.

[ 5 ] The physical world of water is closely bound up with the socio-political world, with water often a key factor in managing risks such as famine , migration, epidemics , inequalities and political instability. Water-related disasters, such as flood and drought , have dominated the list of disasters over the past 50 years and account for 70% of all deaths related to natural disasters .

[ 6 ] Activities [ edit ] UN-Water has three areas of work, which it carries out through the coordinated efforts of its Members and Partners .

Key policy processes [ edit ] UN-Water Members and Partners have helped embed water and sanitation in several agreements, such as the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (which led to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)), the 2015-2030 Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction , the 2015 Addis Ababa Action Agenda on Financing for Development , and the 2015 Paris Agreement within the UN Convention Framework on Climate Change .

The inaugural UN System-wide Strategy for Water and Sanitation was developed by UN-Water and launched in 2024.

[ 7 ] Mandated by UN Member States , the Strategy responds to the outcomes of the UN 2023 Water Conference and Water Action Agenda , which elevated water as a central priority across the UN. In 2025, UN-Water published the Collaborative Implementation Plan , containing "a common set of forward-looking, transformative, system-wide actions that UN entities and its partners can implement together in response to the higher level of ambition set forth in the Strategy".

[ 8 ] UN-Water will inform and support the processes around the in-depth review of SDG 6 at the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development in 2026, UN Water Conferences in 2026 and 2028, and the follow-up on the Pact for the Future in 2027.

[ 9 ] Monitoring and reporting [ edit ] To meet the needs of the 2030 Agenda, UN-Water launched the Integrated Monitoring Initiative for SDG 6 , building on and expanding the experience and lessons learned during the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) period (2000-2015).

[ 10 ] All the custodian agencies of the SDG 6 global indicators [ 11 ] have come together under the initiative, which includes the work of the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation (JMP), the inter-agency initiative GEMI and UN-Water Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking-Water (GLAAS) .

Campaigns [ edit ] Main articles: World Water Day and World Toilet Day Every year, UN-Water coordinates the United Nations international observances on freshwater and sanitation: World Water Day and World Toilet Day. Depending on the official UN theme of the campaign, they are led by one or more UN-Water Members and Partners with a related mandate. On World Water Day, UN-Water releases the UN World Water Development Report focusing on the same topic as the campaign.

Governance [ edit ] Members and Partners [ edit ] UN agencies, programmes and funds with a water-related mandate are Members [ 7 ] of UN-Water. Partners [ 9 ] are international organizations, professional unions, associations or other civil-society groups that are actively involved in water and that have the capacity and willingness to contribute tangibly to the work of UN-Water.

Senior Programme Managers [ edit ] The UN-Water Senior Programme Managers are the representatives of the UN-Water Members at UN-Water. They provide the overall governance and strategic direction. Collectively, they constitute the highest operational decision-making body of UN-Water.

Chair, Vice-Chair, Secretary [ edit ] The Chair of UN-Water is nominated among the UN Executive Heads, after consultations in the UN System Chief Executives Board for Coordination . The vice-chair of UN-Water is elected among the UN-Water Senior Programme Managers. The UN DESA Senior Programme Manager serves as Secretary of UN-Water ex-officio.
