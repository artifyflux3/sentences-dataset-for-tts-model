As a branch of geology , igneous petrology is closely related to volcanology , tectonophysics , and petrology in general. The modern study of igneous rocks uses a number of techniques, some of them developed in the fields of chemistry , physics , or other earth sciences .

Petrography , crystallography , and isotopic studies are common methods used in igneous petrology.

Methods [ edit ] Determination of chemical composition [ edit ] The composition of igneous rocks and minerals can be determined via a variety of methods of varying ease, cost, and complexity. The simplest method is observation of hand samples with the naked eye and/or with a hand lens . This can be used to gauge the general mineralogical composition of the rock, which gives an insight into the composition. A more precise but still relatively inexpensive way to identify minerals (and thereby the bulk chemical composition of the rock) with a petrographic microscope . These microscopes have polarizing plates, filters, and a conoscopic lens that allow the user to measure a variety of crystallographic properties. Another method for determining mineralogy is to use X-ray diffraction , in which a powdered sample is bombarded by X-rays, and the resultant spectrum of crystallographic orientations is compared to a set of standards. One of the most precise ways of determining chemical composition is by the use of an electron microprobe , in which tiny spots of materials are sampled. Electron microprobe analyses can detect both bulk composition and trace element composition.

Dating methods [ edit ] Main articles: Radiometric dating and Geochronology The dating of igneous rocks determines when magma solidified into rock.

Radiogenic isotopes are frequently used to determine the age of igneous rocks.

Potassium–argon dating [ edit ] Main article: Potassium–argon dating In this dating method the amount of 40 Ar trapped in a rock is compared to the amount of 40 K in the rock to calculate the amount of time 40 K must have been decaying in the solid rock to produce all 40 Ar that would have otherwise not have been present there.

Rubidium–strontium dating [ edit ] Main article: Rubidium–strontium dating The rubidium–strontium dating is based on the natural decay of 87 Rb to 87 Sr and the different behaviour of these elements during fractional crystallization of magma. Both Sr and Rb are found in most magmas; however, as fractional crystallization occurs, Sr will tend to be concentrated in plagioclase [ 1 ] crystals while Rb will remain in the melt for a longer time.

87 Rb decays in magma and elsewhere so that every 1.42×10 11 years half of the amount has been converted into 87 Sr. Knowing the decay constant and the amount of 87 Rb and 87 Sr in a rock it is possible to calculate the time that the 87 Rb must have needed before the rock reached closure temperature to produce all 87 Sr, yet considering that there was an initial 87 Sr amount not produced by 87 Rb in the magmatic body. Initial values of 87 Sr, when the magma started fractional crystallization, might be estimated by knowing the amounts of 87 Rb and 87 Sr of two igneous rocks produced at different times by the same magmatic body.

Other methods [ edit ] Stratigraphic principles may be useful to determine the relative age of volcanic rocks.

Tephrochronology is the most common application of stratigraphic dating on volcanic rocks.

Thermobarometry methods [ edit ] See also: Clinopyroxene thermobarometry In petrology the mineral clinopyroxene is used for temperature and pressure calculations of the magma that produced igneous rock containing this mineral.

[ 2 ] Clinopyroxene thermobarometry is one of several geothermobarometers . Two things make this method especially useful: first, clinopyroxene is a common phenocryst in igneous rocks easy to identify; and secondly, the crystallization of the jadeite component of clinopyroxene implies a growth in molar volume being thus a good indicator of pressure .

Thermochronometry [ edit ] Publications [ edit ] Most contemporary ground breaking in igneous petrology has been published in prestigious American and British scientific journals of worldwide circulation such as Science and Nature .

[ 3 ] Study material, overviews of certain topics and older works are often found as books. Many works before the plate tectonics paradigm shift in the 1960s and 1970s contains inaccurate information regarding the origin of magmas.
