Two important types of logical constants are logical connectives and quantifiers .  The equality predicate (usually written '=') is also treated as a logical constant in many systems of logic .

One of the fundamental questions in the philosophy of logic is "What is a logical constant?"; [ 1 ] that is, what special feature of certain constants makes them logical in nature?

[ 2 ] Some symbols that are commonly treated as logical constants are: Symbol Meaning in English T "true" F, ⊥ " false " ¬ " not " ∧ " and " ∨ " or " → " implies ", "if...then" ∀ " for all " ∃ " there exists ", "for some" = " equals " ◻ ◻ {\displaystyle \Box } "necessarily" ◊ ◊ {\displaystyle \Diamond } "possibly" Many of these logical constants are sometimes denoted by alternate symbols (for instance, the use of the symbol "&" rather than "∧" to denote the logical and ).

Defining logical constants is a major part of the work of Gottlob Frege and Bertrand Russell . Russell returned to the subject of logical constants in the preface to the second edition (1937) of The Principles of Mathematics noting that logic becomes linguistic: "If we are to say anything definite about them, [they] must be treated as part of the language, not as part of what the language speaks about." [ 3 ] The text of this book uses relations R , their converses and complements as primitive notions , also taken as logical constants in the form aRb .
