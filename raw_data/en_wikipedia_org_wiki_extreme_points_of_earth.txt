Latitude and longitude [ edit ] See also: List of northernmost items and List of southernmost items Northernmost [ edit ] The northernmost point of land is the northern tip of Kaffeklubben Island , north of Greenland ( 83°40′N 29°50′W ﻿ / ﻿ 83.667°N 29.833°W ﻿ / 83.667; -29.833 ﻿ ( northernmost point on land ) ), which lies slightly north of Cape Morris Jesup , Greenland ( 83°38′N 32°40′W ﻿ / ﻿ 83.633°N 32.667°W ﻿ / 83.633; -32.667 ﻿ ( Cape Morris Jesup ) ). Various shifting gravel bars lie farther north, the most famous being Oodaaq . There have been other islands more northern such as 83-42 and ATOW1996 but they have not been confirmed as permanent.

Southernmost [ edit ] The southernmost continental point of land outside Antarctica is in South America at Cape Froward , Magallanes Region , Chile ( 53°56′00″S 071°20′00″W ﻿ / ﻿ 53.93333°S 71.33333°W ﻿ / -53.93333; -71.33333 ).

The southernmost point of (liquid) water is a bay on the Filchner–Ronne Ice Shelf along the coast of Antarctica ( 83°S 59°W ﻿ / ﻿ 83°S 59°W ﻿ / -83; -59 ) [ citation needed ] , about 100 km (60 mi) south of Berkner Island .

The southernmost point of ocean is located on the Gould Coast ( 84°30′S 150°0′W ﻿ / ﻿ 84.500°S 150.000°W ﻿ / -84.500; -150.000 ﻿ ( southernmost point of ocean ) ).

[ citation needed ] [ 1 ] The southernmost point of open ocean is in the Bay of Whales , also part of the Ross Sea , at 78°30'S, at the edge of the Ross Ice Shelf .

[ 2 ] The southernmost island is considered to be Deverall Island , near the Shackleton Coast , surrounded by the Ross Ice Shelf although there is an island in Lake Vostok but it is currently under ice.

[ 3 ] Easternmost and westernmost [ edit ] The easternmost and westernmost points on Earth , based on the east–west standard for describing longitude , can be found anywhere along the 180th meridian , which passes through the Arctic , Pacific , and Southern Oceans , as well as parts of Siberia (including Wrangel Island ), Antarctica, and three islands of Fiji ( Vanua Levu 's eastern peninsula, the middle of Taveuni , and the western part of Rabi Island ).

Using instead the path of the International Date Line (which is not a straight line), i.e. define "easternmost" as "the first to see a new day" and define "westernmost" as "the last to see a new day", the westernmost point on land is Attu Island , Alaska , and the easternmost point on land is Caroline Island , Kiribati .

The longest in North America is 5,813 km (3,612 mi) along the meridian 97°52'30"W, from northern Canada ( 68°21′0″N 97°52′30″W ﻿ / ﻿ 68.35000°N 97.87500°W ﻿ / 68.35000; -97.87500 ), through the United States , to southern Mexico ( 16°1′0″N 97°52′30″W ﻿ / ﻿ 16.01667°N 97.87500°W ﻿ / 16.01667; -97.87500 ).

The longest continuous north–south distance at sea is 15,986 km (9,933 mi) along the meridian 34°45'45"W, from the coast of Eastern Greenland ( 66°23′45″N 34°45′45″W ﻿ / ﻿ 66.39583°N 34.76250°W ﻿ / 66.39583; -34.76250 ) across the Atlantic Ocean to the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf , on the coast of Antarctica ( 77°37′0″S 34°45′45″W ﻿ / ﻿ 77.61667°S 34.76250°W ﻿ / -77.61667; -34.76250 ). The longest in the Pacific Ocean is 15,883 km (9,869 mi) along the meridian 172°8'30"W, from the coast of Siberia ( 64°45′0″N 172°8′30″W ﻿ / ﻿ 64.75000°N 172.14167°W ﻿ / 64.75000; -172.14167 ) to the Ross Ice Shelf in Antarctica ( 78°20′0″S 172°8′30″W ﻿ / ﻿ 78.33333°S 172.14167°W ﻿ / -78.33333; -172.14167 ).

The meridian that crosses the greatest total distance on land (disregarding intervening bodies of water) is still to be determined. It is likely located in the vicinity of 22°E, which is the longest integer meridian that fits that criterion, crossing a total of 13,035 km (8,100 mi) of land through Europe (3,370 km or 2,090 mi), Africa (7,458 km or 4,634 mi), and Antarctica (2,207 km or 1,371 mi).

[ b ] More than 65% of this meridian's length is located on land. The next six longest integer meridians by total distance over land are, in order: 23°E: 12,953 km (8,049 mi) through Europe (3,325 km or 2,066 mi), Africa (7,415 km or 4,607 mi), and Antarctica (2,214 km or 1,376 mi) 27°E: 12,943 km (8,042 mi) through Europe (3,254 km or 2,022 mi), Asia (246 km or 153 mi), Africa (7,223 km or 4,488 mi), and Antarctica (2,221 km or 1,380 mi) 25°E: 12,875 km (8,000 mi) through Europe (3,344 km or 2,078 mi), Africa (7,327 km or 4,553 mi), and Antarctica (2,204 km or 1,370 mi) 26°E: 12,858 km (7,990 mi) through Europe (3,404 km or 2,115 mi), Africa (7,258 km or 4,510 mi), and Antarctica (2,196 km or 1,365 mi) 24°E: 12,794 km (7,950 mi) through Europe (3,263 km or 2,028 mi), Africa (7,346 km or 4,565 mi), and Antarctica (2,185 km or 1,358 mi) 28°E: 12,778 km (7,940 mi) through Europe (3,039 km or 1,888 mi), Asia (388 km or 241 mi), and Africa (7,117 km or 4,422 mi) Along any geodesic [ edit ] These are the longest straight lines [ c ] that can be drawn between any two points on the surface of the Earth and remain exclusively over land or water; the points need not lie on the same line of latitude or longitude.

The longest continuous straight-line ( great circle ) path over land is 13,588 km (8,443 mi) long and spans between the West African coast near Greenville , Liberia ( 5°2′51.59″N 9°7′23.26″W ﻿ / ﻿ 5.0476639°N 9.1231278°W ﻿ / 5.0476639; -9.1231278 ) and a peninsula about 100 km (60 mi) northeast of Wenzhou , China ( 28°17′7.68″N 121°38′17.31″E ﻿ / ﻿ 28.2854667°N 121.6381417°E ﻿ / 28.2854667; 121.6381417 ), passing over the Suez Canal .

[ 4 ] The longest continuous straight-line land distance solely within continental Africa is 8,402 km (5,221 mi), along a line that begins just east of Tangier , Morocco , and ends 100 km (60 mi) east of Port Elizabeth , South Africa . This line passes through Morocco, Algeria , Mali , Niger , Nigeria , Cameroon , Equatorial Guinea , Gabon , Republic of the Congo , Democratic Republic of the Congo , Angola , Namibia , Botswana , and South Africa.

[ citation needed ] The longest continuous straight-line land distance solely within continental Asia is 10,152 km (6,308 mi), along a line that begins on the Indian coast near Kanyakumari and ends at the Bering Sea coast of the Chukchi Peninsula in Russia . This line passes through India, Nepal , China , Mongolia , and Russia.

[ citation needed ] The longest continuous straight-line land distance solely within continental Europe (defining the Ural Mountains as the border between Europe and Asia) is 5,325 km (3,309 mi), along a line that begins at Cape St. Vincent , Portugal , and ends at the Urals, near the town of Perm, Russia . This line passes through Portugal, Spain , France , Germany , Poland , Lithuania , Belarus , and Russia.

This line passes through Alaska , Canada , the contiguous United States , and Mexico.

[ citation needed ] The longest continuous straight-line land distance solely within continental South America is 7,248 km (4,504 mi), along a line that begins 10 km (6.2 mi) northeast of Puerto Cumarebo , Venezuela , and ends 80 km (50 mi) south of the town of Punta Arenas , Chile .

[ 5 ] There are several possible candidates for the longest continuous straight-line distance in any direction at sea , as there are many possible ways to travel along a great circle for more than the antipodic length of 19,840 km (12,330 mi). Some examples of such routes would be: From the south coast of Balochistan province somewhere near Port of Karachi , Pakistan ( 25°25′N 66°25′E ﻿ / ﻿ 25.417°N 66.417°E ﻿ / 25.417; 66.417 ) across the Arabian Sea , southwest through the Indian Ocean, near Comoros , passing Namaete Canyon, near the South African coast, across the South Atlantic Ocean, then west across Cape Horn , then northwest across the Pacific Ocean, near Easter Island , passing the antipodal point near Emlilia island, through the South Bering Sea and ending somewhere on the northeast coast of Kamchatka , near Ossora ( 59°38′N 163°24′E ﻿ / ﻿ 59.633°N 163.400°E ﻿ / 59.633; 163.400 ). This route is 32,040 km (19,910 mi) long.

[ 6 ] This route was confirmed to be the longest (at about 32,090 km or 19,940 mi) given map data at a 1.8 km (1.1 mi) level of resolution.

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ d ] From the south coast of Hormozgan province, Iran ( 25°35′N 58°22′E ﻿ / ﻿ 25.583°N 58.367°E ﻿ / 25.583; 58.367 ) across the Gulf of Oman , southeast across the Arabian Sea, passing south of Australia and New Zealand , near the Antarctic coast, then northeast across the South Pacific Ocean, passing the antipodal point and ending on the southwest coast of Mexico somewhere near Ciudad Lázaro Cárdenas ( 17°57′N 101°57′W ﻿ / ﻿ 17.950°N 101.950°W ﻿ / 17.950; -101.950 ). This route is 25,267 km (15,700 mi) long.

[ 9 ] From Invercargill , New Zealand ( 46°37′S 168°59′E ﻿ / ﻿ 46.617°S 168.983°E ﻿ / -46.617; 168.983 ) across Cape Horn , then off the coast of Brazil close to Recife , passing north of Cape Verde , passing the antipodal point and ending somewhere on the southwest coast of Ireland ( 52°09′N 6°34′W ﻿ / ﻿ 52.150°N 6.567°W ﻿ / 52.150; -6.567 ). This route is 20,701 km (12,863 mi) long.

[ 10 ] Along any diameter (straight line passing through the centre of the Earth) [ edit ] As distinct from geodesic lines, which appear straight only when projected onto the spheroidal surface of the Earth (i.e. arcs of great circles), straight lines passing through the Earth's centre can be constructed through the interior of the Earth between almost any two points on the surface of the Earth (some extreme topographical situations such as overhanging cliffs being the rare exceptions [ citation needed ] ). A line projected from the summit of Cayambe in Ecuador (see highest points ) through the axial centre of the Earth to its antipode on the island of Sumatra results in the longest diameter that can be produced anywhere through the Earth. As the variable circumference of the Earth approaches 40,000 kilometres (25,000 mi), such a maximum "diameter" or "antipodal" line would be on the order of 13,000 kilometres (8,000 mi) long.

[ citation needed ] Elevation [ edit ] See also: Lists of highest points , List of elevation extremes by region , and List of elevation extremes by country Highest points [ edit ] While Everest is Earth's highest elevation (green) and Mauna Kea is tallest from its base (orange), Cayambe is farthest from Earth's axis (pink) and Chimborazo is farthest from Earth's centre (blue). Not to scale The summit of Chimborazo in Ecuador is the farthest point from Earth's centre.

The highest point on Earth's surface measured from sea level is the summit of Mount Everest , on the border of Nepal and China . While measurements of its height vary slightly, the elevation of its peak was most recently established in 2020 by the Nepali and Chinese authorities as 8,848.86 m (29,031.7 ft) above sea level.

[ 11 ] The summit was first reached probably by Sir Edmund Hillary of New Zealand and Tenzing Norgay Sherpa of Nepal in 1953.

The point farthest from Earth's centre is the summit of Chimborazo [ 12 ] in Ecuador , at 6,384.4 km (3,967.1 mi) from Earth's centre; the peak's elevation relative to sea level is 6,263.47 m (20,549 ft).

[ e ] Because Earth is an oblate spheroid rather than a perfect sphere , it is wider at the equator and narrower toward each pole . Therefore, the summit of Chimborazo, which is near the Equator, is farther away from Earth's centre than the summit of Mount Everest is; the latter is 2,168 m (7,112.9 ft) closer, at 6,382.3 km (3,965.8 mi) from Earth's centre.

Peru 's Huascarán (at 6,768 m or 22,205 ft) contends closely with Chimborazo, though the former is a mere 10 m (33 ft) closer to the Earth's centre.

The fastest point on Earth or, in other words, the point farthest from Earth's rotational axis is the summit of Cayambe [ 14 ] in Ecuador, which rotates around Earth's axis at a speed of 1,675.89 km/h (1,041.35 mph) and is 6,383.95 km (3,966.80 mi) from the axis. Like Chimborazo, which is the fourth-fastest peak at 1,675.47 km/h (1,041.09 mph), Cayambe is close to the Equator and takes advantage of the oblate spheroid figure of Earth . More important, however, Cayambe's proximity to the Equator means that the majority of its distance from the Earth's centre contributes to Cayambe's distance from the Earth's axis.

Highest geographical features [ edit ] The highest volcano is Ojos del Salado on the Argentina – Chile border. It has the highest summit, 6,893 m (22,615 ft), of any volcano on Earth.

The highest natural lake is an unnamed crater lake on Ojos del Salado at 6,390 m (20,965 ft), [ 15 ] on the Argentina side. Another candidate was Lhagba Pool on the northeast slopes of Mount Everest , Tibet, at an elevation of 6,368 m (20,892 ft), which has since dried up.

[ 16 ] The highest navigable lake is Lake Titicaca , on the border of Bolivia and Peru in the Andes , at 3,812 m (12,507 ft).

The highest glacier is the Khumbu Glacier on the southwest slopes of Mount Everest in Nepal, beginning on the west side of Lhotse at an elevation of 7,600 to 8,000 m (24,900 to 26,200 ft).

[ 17 ] The highest river is disputed; one candidate from many possibilities is the Ating Ho , which flows into the Aong Tso (Hagung Tso), a large lake in Tibet, and has an elevation of about 6,100 m (20,013 ft) at its source at 32°49′30″N 81°03′45″E ﻿ / ﻿ 32.82500°N 81.06250°E ﻿ / 32.82500; 81.06250 ﻿ ( Ating Ho (source) ) . Another very large and high river is the Yarlung Tsangpo or upper Brahmaputra River in Tibet, whose main stem, the Maquan River , has its source at about 6,020 m (19,751 ft) above sea level at 30°48′59″N 82°42′45″E ﻿ / ﻿ 30.81639°N 82.71250°E ﻿ / 30.81639; 82.71250 ﻿ ( Maquan River (source) ) .

[ 18 ] Above these elevations, there are no constantly flowing rivers since the temperature is almost always below freezing.

The highest island is one of a number of islands in the Orba Co lake in Tibet, at an elevation of 5,209 m (17,090 ft).

[ 19 ] Highest points attainable by transportation [ edit ] The highest point accessible by land vehicle is an elevation of 6,688 m (21,942 ft) on Ojos del Salado in Chile , which was reached by the Chilean duo of Gonzalo and Eduardo Canales Moya on 21 April 2007 with a modified Suzuki Samurai , setting the high-altitude record for a four-wheeled vehicle.

by road (dead end) is on a mining road to the summit of Aucanquilcha in Chile , which reaches an elevation of 6,176 m (20,262 ft). It was once usable by 20-tonne mining trucks.

[ 20 ] The road is no longer usable.

21°12′50″S 68°28′30″W ﻿ / ﻿ 21.214°S 68.475°W ﻿ / -21.214; -68.475 by road (mountain pass) is disputed; there are a number of competing claims for this title due to the definition of "motorable pass" (i.e. a surfaced road or one simply passable by a vehicle): The highest asphalted road is the single-lane road to Umling La , located 17 km (11 mi) west of Demchok in Ladakh , India , which reaches 5,800 m (19,029 ft) ("19,300 feet" according to a Border Roads Organisation sign there that recognizes it as the "World's Highest Motorable Pass").

[ 21 ] [ 22 ] Before the asphalting of the road over Umling La, the highest asphalted road was Tibet 's Semo La pass at 5,565 m (18,258 ft). It is used by trucks and buses regularly.

[ 23 ] The Ticlio pass, on the Central Road of Peru, is the highest surfaced road in the Americas, at an elevation of 4,818 m (15,807 ft).

The highest unsurfaced road has several different claimants. All are unsurfaced or gravel roads including Mana Pass , between India and Tibet , which is crossed by a gravel road reaching 5,610 m (18,406 ft). The heavily trafficked Khardung La in Ladakh lies at 5,359 m (17,582 ft). A possibly motorable gravel road crosses Marsimik La in Ladakh at 5,582 m (18,314 ft).

by train is Tanggula Pass , located on the Qinghai–Tibet (Qingzang) Railway in the Tanggula Mountains of Qinghai/Tibet, China , at 5,072 m (16,640 ft). The Tanggula railway station is the world's highest railway station at 5,068 m (16,627 ft). Before the Qingzang Railway was built, the highest railway ran between Lima and Huancayo in Peru, reaching 4,829 m (15,843 ft) at Ticlio .

[ 24 ] by oceangoing vessel is a segment of the Rhine–Main–Danube Canal between the Hilpoltstein and Bachhausen locks in Bavaria , Germany. The locks artificially raise the surface level of the water in the canal to 406 m (1,332 ft) above mean sea level, higher than any other lock system in the world, making it the highest point currently accessible by oceangoing commercial watercraft.

La Rinconada , Peru The highest commercial airport is Daocheng Yading Airport , Sichuan , China, at 4,411 m (14,472 ft).

[ 25 ] The proposed Nagqu Dagring Airport in Tibet, if built, will be 25 m (82 ft) higher at 4,436 m (14,554 ft).

The highest helipad is Sonam, Siachen Glacier , India, at a height of 6,400 m (20,997 ft) above sea level.

[ 26 ] The highest permanent human settlement is La Rinconada, Peru , 5,100 m (16,732 ft), in the Peruvian Andes .

The farthest road from the Earth's centre is the Road to Carrel Hut in the Ecuadorian Andes , at an elevation of 4,850 m (15,912 ft) above sea level and a distance of 6,382.9 km (3,966 mi) from the centre of the Earth.

[ 27 ] Lowest points [ edit ] Lowest natural points [ edit ] See also: List of places on land with elevations below sea level The deepest point below the ocean's atmospheric surface is Challenger Deep , at the bottom of the Mariana Trench , 11,034 m (36,201 ft) below sea level.

[ 28 ] Jacques Piccard and U.S. Navy Lieutenant Don Walsh first reached Challenger Deep in 1960 aboard the bathyscaphe Trieste , followed by filmmaker James Cameron in 2012 aboard Deepsea Challenger . Between 2020 and 2022, DSV Limiting Factor made 19 dives to Challenger Deep, carrying with it 19 further visitors.

[ 29 ] [ 30 ] The deepest known cave is in the Krubera Cave in Abkhazia , Georgia , with its deepest known point 2,199 ± 20 metres (7,215 ± 66 ft) below its entrance. The record was set in 2006, and it remains one of only two known caves deeper than 2,000 meters.

[ 31 ] The lowest point on land not covered by liquid water is the canyon under Denman Glacier in Antarctica , with the bedrock being 3,500 m (11,500 ft) below sea level.

[ 32 ] [ 33 ] The shore of the Dead Sea in Israel The lowest point on dry land is the shore of the Dead Sea , shared by Israel , Palestine and Jordan , 432.65 m (1,419 ft) below sea level. As the Dead Sea waters are receding, the water surface level drops more than 1 metre (3.3 ft) per year.

[ 34 ] The point on the atmospheric surface closest to the Earth's centre (interpreted as a natural surface of the land or sea that is accessible by a person) is the surface of the Arctic Ocean at the Geographic North Pole (6,356.77 km or 3,950 mi).

The point on the surface of Earth's crust closest to the Earth's centre (interpreted as a land surface or sea floor) is the bottom of Litke Deep , in the Arctic Ocean , at 6,351.7043 km (3,947 mi) from Earth's centre; the deep's depth relative to sea level is 5,449 m (17,877 ft). Because Earth is an oblate spheroid rather than a perfect sphere , it is wider at the equator and narrower toward each pole . Therefore, the bottom of Litke Deep, which is near the North Pole, is closer to Earth's centre than the bottom of Challenger Deep is; the latter is 14.7268 km (48,316.3 ft) further, at 6,366.4311 km (3,955.9 mi) from Earth's centre.

[ 35 ] Molloy Deep , also in Arctic Ocean (at 6,357.5178 km or 3,950 mi) from Earth's centre contends closely with Litke Deep, the difference from Earth's centre being just 389 m (1,276 ft).

The point on the ocean surface farthest below sea level is located in the Indian Ocean , about 1,200 km (750 mi) southwest of India, the Indian Ocean Geoid Low , about 106 m (348 ft) below the global mean sea level .

[ 36 ] Lowest artificial points [ edit ] The lowest point underground ever reached was 12,262 m (40,230 ft) deep (SG-3 at the Kola Superdeep Borehole , which has since been enclosed).

The lowest human-sized point underground is 3,900 m (12,800 ft) [ 37 ] below ground at the TauTona Mine , Carletonville , South Africa.

The lowest (from sea level) artificially made point with open sky may be the Hambach surface mine , Germany, which reaches a depth of 293 m (961 ft) below sea level.

The lowest (from surface) artificially made point with open sky may be the Bingham Canyon Open Pit Copper Mine , Utah , United States, at a depth of 1,200 m (3,900 ft) below surface level.

The lowest point underwater is the 10,685 m (35,056 ft)-deep (as measured from the subsea wellhead ) oil and gas well drilled on the Tiber Oil Field in the Gulf of Mexico . The wellhead of this well is an additional 1,259 m (4,131 ft) underwater, for a total distance of 11,944 m (39,186 ft) as measured from sea level.

by train , excluding tracks in mines, is located in the Seikan Tunnel in Japan , at 240 m (787 ft) below sea level. For comparison, the undersea Channel Tunnel between England and France reaches a depth of 115 m (377 ft) below sea level.

by ship , is located in the Indian Ocean , about 1,200 km (750 mi) southwest of India, the Indian Ocean Geoid Low , about 106 m (348 ft) below the global mean sea level .

[ 36 ] Some mines have roads accessible from outside or rail tracks, located more than two thousand metres below sea level, for example in some South African gold mines.

The lowest railroad station was formerly the Japanese Yoshioka-Kaitei Station , at 150 m (492 ft) below sea level, but it closed in 2014. The lowest railroad station not inside a tunnel is 120 m (394 ft) below sea level, at Beit She'an railway station in Israel .

[ citation needed ] The lowest airfield is the Bar Yehuda Airfield , near Masada , Israel , at 378 m (1,240 ft) below sea level.

The lowest international airport is Atyrau Airport , near Atyrau , Kazakhstan , at 22 m (72 ft) below sea level, in the basin of the Caspian Sea .

The lowest major city is Baku , Azerbaijan , located 28 m (92 ft) below sea level, which makes it the lowest-lying national capital in the world and also the largest city in the world located below sea level.

^ Height above sea level is the usual choice of definition for elevation. The point farthest away from the centre of the Earth, however, is Chimborazo in Ecuador (6,267 m (20,561 feet)). This is due to the Earth's oblate spheroid shape, with points near the Equator being farther out from the centre than those at the poles.

[ 64 ] [ 65 ] Humans and biogeography [ edit ] On land, vegetation appears on a scale from brown (low vegetation) to dark green (heavy vegetation); at the ocean surface, phytoplankton are indicated on a scale from purple (low) to yellow (high).

For representational purposes only: The point on earth closest to everyone in the world on average was calculated to be in Central Asia, with a mean distance of 5,000 kilometers (3,000 mi). Its antipodal point is correspondingly the farthest point from everyone on earth, and is located in the South Pacific near Easter Island , with a mean distance of 15,000 kilometers (9,300 mi). The data used by this figure is lumped at the country level, and is therefore precise only to country-scale distances, larger nations heavily skewed. Far more granular data -- kilometer level, is now available -- compares with this old "textbook" example.

In contrast to places with the highest density of life, like terrestrial [ 66 ] tropical regions, and beside local extreme conditions, which might only be overcome by extremophiles , there are areas of extreme low amounts of life.

Next to terrestrial lifeless areas like the Antarctic desert 's McMurdo Dry Valleys and its Don Juan Pond , the most lifeless area in the ocean studied (other than the more general dead zones ) is the South Pacific Gyre , [ 67 ] corresponding to the oceanic pole of inaccessibility .

The oceanic pole of inaccessibility is also the antipodal area of the human center of population which lies today around southern Central Asia . Similarly the world's economic center of gravity has been drifting since antiquity from Central Asia to Northern Europe and contemporarily back to Central Asia.

[ 68 ] The related centre of gravity of the worlds carbon emission has shifted from Britain during the Industrial Revolution to the Atlantic, back again and contemporarily into Central Asia.

[ 69 ] Remoteness [ edit ] Poles of inaccessibility [ edit ] Main article: Pole of inaccessibility Each continent has its own continental pole of inaccessibility , defined as the place on the continent that is farthest from any ocean. Similarly, each ocean has its own oceanic pole of inaccessibility , defined as the place in the ocean that is farthest from any land.

Continental [ edit ] The most distant point from an ocean is the Eurasian Pole of Inaccessibility (or "EPIA") 46°17′N 86°40′E ﻿ / ﻿ 46.283°N 86.667°E ﻿ / 46.283; 86.667 ﻿ ( Continental Pole of Inaccessibility ) , in China 's Xinjiang region near the border with Kazakhstan. Calculations have shown that this point, located in the Dzoosotoyn Elisen Desert , is 2,645 km (1,644 mi) from the nearest coastline. The nearest settlement to the EPIA is Suluk at 46°15′N 86°50′E ﻿ / ﻿ 46.250°N 86.833°E ﻿ / 46.250; 86.833 ﻿ ( Suluk ) , about 11 km (7 mi) to the east.

[ citation needed ] A 2007 study suggests that the historical calculation of the EPIA failed to recognize the point where the Gulf of Ob joins the Arctic Ocean, and proposes instead that varying definitions of coastline could result in other locations for the EPIA: EPIA1, somewhere between 44°17′N 82°11′E ﻿ / ﻿ 44.283°N 82.183°E ﻿ / 44.283; 82.183 ﻿ ( EPIA1.1 ) and 44°29′N 82°19′E ﻿ / ﻿ 44.483°N 82.317°E ﻿ / 44.483; 82.317 ﻿ ( EPIA1.2 ) , is about 2,510 ± 10 km (1,559.6 ± 6.2 mi) from the nearest ocean.

EPIA2, somewhere between 45°17′N 88°08′E ﻿ / ﻿ 45.283°N 88.133°E ﻿ / 45.283; 88.133 ﻿ ( EPIA2.1 ) and 45°28′N 88°14′E ﻿ / ﻿ 45.467°N 88.233°E ﻿ / 45.467; 88.233 ﻿ ( EPIA2.2 ) , is about 2,514 ± 7 km (1,562.1 ± 4.3 mi) from the nearest ocean.

[ 71 ] If adopted, this would place the final EPIA roughly 130 km (80 mi) closer to the ocean than the point that is currently agreed upon.

[ 71 ] Coincidentally, EPIA1, or EPIA2, and the most remote of the Oceanic Pole of Inaccessibility (specifically, the point in the South Pacific Ocean that is farthest from land) are similarly remote; EPIA1 is less than 200 km (120 mi) closer to the ocean than the Oceanic Pole of Inaccessibility is to land.

The continental poles of inaccessibility for the other continents are as follows: Africa : 5°39′N 26°10′E ﻿ / ﻿ 5.65°N 26.17°E ﻿ / 5.65; 26.17 ﻿ ( Continental Pole of Inaccessibility of Africa ) , [ 71 ] close to the tripoint of the Central African Republic , South Sudan , and the Democratic Republic of the Congo Australia : either 23°2′S 132°10′E ﻿ / ﻿ 23.033°S 132.167°E ﻿ / -23.033; 132.167 ﻿ ( Australian Pole of Inaccessibility ) , [ 72 ] or 23°10′S 132°16′E ﻿ / ﻿ 23.17°S 132.27°E ﻿ / -23.17; 132.27 ﻿ ( Continental Pole of Inaccessibility of Australia ) , [ 71 ] near Papunya , Northern Territory North America : 43°22′N 101°58′W ﻿ / ﻿ 43.36°N 101.97°W ﻿ / 43.36; -101.97 ﻿ ( Pole of Inaccessibility North America ) , [ 71 ] between Kyle, South Dakota and Allen, South Dakota , United States .

[ 73 ] The centre of the Pacific Ocean and the Water Hemisphere lie west to it, closer to Oceania , off the coast of Kiribati at 47°24′42″N 2°37′15″W ﻿ / ﻿ 47.411667°N 2.620833°W ﻿ / 47.411667; -2.620833 and New Zealand at 47°24′42″S 177°22′45″E ﻿ / ﻿ 47.411667°S 177.379167°E ﻿ / -47.411667; 177.379167 respectively.

Other places considered the most remote [ edit ] Bouvet Island The most remote island is Bouvet Island , a small, uninhabited island in the South Atlantic Ocean that is a dependency of Norway . It lies at coordinates 54°26′S 3°24′E ﻿ / ﻿ 54.433°S 3.400°E ﻿ / -54.433; 3.400 ﻿ ( most remote island ) . The nearest land is the uninhabited Queen Maud Land , Antarctica (also claimed by Norway), over 1,600 km (1,000 mi) to the south. The nearest inhabited lands are Gough Island , 1,845 km (1,146 mi) away, Tristan da Cunha , 2,260 km (1,404 mi) away, and the coast of South Africa , 2,580 km (1,603 mi) away.

The title for most remote inhabited island or archipelago (the farthest away from any other permanently inhabited place) depends on how the question is interpreted. If the south Atlantic island Tristan da Cunha (population about 300) and its dependency Gough Island (with a small staffed research post), which are 399 km (248 mi) from each other, are considered part of the same archipelago, or if Gough Island is not counted because it has no permanent residents, then Tristan da Cunha is the world's most remote inhabited island/archipelago: the main island, also called Tristan da Cunha, is 2,434 km (1,512 mi) from the island Saint Helena , 2,816 km (1,750 mi) from South Africa , and 3,360 km (2,090 mi) from South America. It is 2,260 km (1,404 mi) away from uninhabited Bouvet Island . However, if Gough and Tristan da Cunha are considered separately, they disqualify each other, and the most remote inhabited island is Easter Island in the South Pacific Ocean, which lies 2,075 km (1,289 mi) from Pitcairn Island (about 50 residents in 2013), 2,606 km (1,619 mi) from Rikitea on the island of Mangareva (the nearest town with a population over 500), and 3,512 km (2,182 mi) from the coast of Chile (the nearest continental point and the country of which Easter Island is part). The Kerguelen Islands in the southern Indian Ocean are another contender, lying 1,340 km (830 mi) from the small Alfred Faure scientific station in Île de la Possession , but otherwise more than 3,300 km (2,100 mi) from the coast of Madagascar (the nearest permanently inhabited place), 450 km (280 mi) northwest of the uninhabited Heard Island and McDonald Islands (both a part of Australia ), and 1,440 km (890 mi) from the non-permanent scientific station located in Île Amsterdam .

Remote cities The most remote city with a population in excess of one million from the nearest city with a population in excess of one million is Auckland , New Zealand . The nearest city of comparable size or greater is Sydney , Australia , 2,168.9 km (1,347.7 mi) away.

[ 74 ] The most remote city with a population in excess of one million from the nearest city with a population above 100,000 is Perth , Australia, located 2,138 km (1,328 mi) [ 75 ] away from Adelaide , Australia.

The most remote city with a population in excess of 100,000 from the nearest city with a population in excess of 100,000 is Honolulu , Hawaii , United States. The nearest city of comparable size or greater is San Francisco , 3,850 km (2,390 mi) away.

[ 76 ] The most remote national capitals are Wellington , New Zealand, and Canberra , Australia, which are 2,326 km (1,445 mi) apart from each other and neither is closer to another capital.

The most remote airport in the world from another airport is Mataveri International Airport (IPC) on Easter Island , which has a single runway for military and public use. It is located 2,603 km (1,617 mi) from Totegegie Airport (GMR; very few flights) in the Gambier Islands , French Polynesia and 3,759 km (2,336 mi) from Santiago, Chile (SCL; a fairly large airport). In comparison, the airport at the Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station (NZSP) is far less remote, being located only 1,355 km (842 mi) from Williams Field (NZWD) near Ross Island .

[ 77 ] Centre [ edit ] Main article: Geographical center of Earth For other uses, see Axis mundi .

Since the Earth is a spheroid , its centre (the core ) is thousands of kilometres beneath its crust . Still, there have been attempts to define various "centrepoints" on the Earth's surface.

The centre of the standard geographic model as viewed on a traditional world map is the point 0°, 0° (the coordinates of zero degrees latitude by zero degrees longitude), which is located in the Atlantic Ocean about 614 km (382 mi) south of Accra , Ghana , in the Gulf of Guinea . It lies at the intersection of the Equator and the Prime Meridian , is marked with a buoy, and is sometimes called Null Island . However, the selection of the Prime Meridian as the 0° longitude meridian depended on cultural and historical factors and is therefore geographically arbitrary (any of the Earth's meridians could, in principle, be defined as 0° longitude); consequently, the position of the "Null Island" centrepoint is also arbitrary.

The centre of population , the place to which there is the shortest average route for every individual human being in the world, could also be considered a "centre of the world". This point is located in the north of the Indian subcontinent , [ citation needed ] although the precise location has never been calculated and is constantly shifting due to changes in the distribution of the human population across the planet.

Denman Subglacial Trench −3,500 m (−11,500 ft) Antarctica Trough beneath Jakobshavn Isbræ −1,512 m (−4,961 ft) [ 92 ] Greenland , Denmark Meteorological extremes [ edit ] Coldest and hottest inhabited places on Earth [ edit ] Hottest inhabited place Dallol, Ethiopia (Amharic: ዳሎል), whose annual mean temperature was recorded from 1960 to 1966 as 34.4 °C (93.9 °F).

[ 93 ] The average daily maximum temperature during the same period was 41.1 °C (106.0 °F).

[ 94 ] Coldest inhabited place Oymyakon (Russian: Оймяко́н; Yakut: Өймөкөөн), a rural locality (selo) in Oymyakonsky District of the Sakha Republic , the Russian Federation, has the coldest monthly mean, with −45.7 °C (−50.3 °F) the average temperature in January, the coldest month.

Eureka , Nunavut, Canada has the lowest annual mean temperature at −19.7 °C (−3.5 °F).

[ 95 ] The South Pole and some other places in Antarctica are colder and are populated year-round, but almost everyone stays less than a year and could be considered visitors, not inhabitants.

Ground temperatures [ edit ] Temperatures measured directly on the ground may exceed air temperatures by 30 to 50 °C.

[ 96 ] A ground temperature of 84 °C (183.2 °F) has been recorded in Port Sudan , Sudan .

[ 97 ] A ground temperature of 93.9 °C (201 °F) was recorded in Furnace Creek , Death Valley , California , United States on 15 July 1972; this may be the highest natural ground surface temperature ever recorded.

[ 98 ] The theoretical maximum possible ground surface temperature has been estimated to be between 90 and 100 °C for dry, darkish soils of low thermal conductivity.

[ 99 ] Satellite measurements of ground temperature taken between 2003 and 2009, taken with the MODIS infrared spectroradiometer on the Aqua satellite, found a maximum temperature of 70.7 °C (159.3 °F), which was recorded in 2005 in the Lut Desert , Iran . The Lut Desert was also found to have the highest maximum temperature in 5 of the 7 years measured (2004, 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2009). These measurements reflect averages over a large region and so are lower than the maximum point surface temperature.

[ 96 ] Satellite measurements of the surface temperature of Antarctica, taken between 1982 and 2013, found a coldest temperature of −93.2 °C (−136 °F) on 10 August 2010, at 81°48′S 59°18′E ﻿ / ﻿ 81.8°S 59.3°E ﻿ / -81.8; 59.3 . Although this is not comparable to an air temperature, it is believed that the air temperature at this location would have been lower than the official record lowest air temperature of −89.2 °C.

If the previous Date Line were followed, the easternmost point would be Tafahi Niuatoputapu, in the Tonga Islands .

^ By comparison, the meridian that passes through the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt (31°08'3.69"E) is 855 km (531 mi) shorter.

^ A geodesic is defined as the shortest route between any two points on the surface of the Earth, as measured along the surface of the Earth (rather than through the Earth's interior); they are "straight lines" only in the sense that they are plotted on an idealized two-dimensional surface of the three-dimensional Earth, neglecting changes in surface elevation. On an idealized spherical model of the Earth, geodesics are equivalent to great-circle distances measured along the arcs of great circles .

^ The "longest continuous straight-line distance in any direction at sea" from Karachi to Kamchatka was originally added to Wikipedia by user Muh1974 on 21 January 2010 and then confirmed by Chabukswar and Mukherjee in 2018.

[ 7 ] The source of this discovery before 2010 is unknown as of August 2022 [update] .
