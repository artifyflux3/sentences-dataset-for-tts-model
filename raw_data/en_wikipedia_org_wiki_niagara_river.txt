The river flows around Grand Island, and then flows over Niagara Falls.  It narrows in the Niagara Gorge , where two hydropower reservoirs are visible, and then widens after exiting the gorge. The Welland Canal is visible on the far left.

American Falls with Goat Island to its right The Niagara River ( / n aɪ ˈ æ ɡ ər ə , - ɡ r ə / ny- AGG -ər-ə, -⁠grə ) flows north from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario , forming part of the border between Ontario , Canada , to the west, and New York , United States , to the east. The origin of the river's name is debated.

Iroquoian scholar Bruce Trigger suggests it is derived from a branch of the local Neutral Confederacy , referred to as the Niagagarega people on several late- 17th-century French maps.

[ 6 ] George R. Stewart posits that it comes from an Iroquois town named Ongniaahra , meaning "point of land cut in two." [ 7 ] The river, occasionally described as a strait , [ 8 ] is approximately 58 kilometres (36 mi) long and includes Niagara Falls . Over the past 12,000 years, the falls have moved roughly 11 kilometres (6.8 mi) upstream from the leading edge of the Niagara Escarpment , creating a gorge below the falls. Today, the diversion of the river for electricity generation has significantly slowed the rate of erosion . The total elevation drop along the river is 99 metres (325 ft). The Niagara Gorge, downstream from the falls, includes the Niagara Whirlpool and additional rapids .

Power plants on the river include the Sir Adam Beck Hydroelectric Generating Stations (built in 1922 and 1954) on the Canadian side, and the Robert Moses Niagara Power Plant (built in 1961) on the American side, collectively generating 4.4 gigawatts of electricity. The International Control Dam , constructed in 1954, regulates river flow . Ships on the Great Lakes use the Welland Canal , part of the St. Lawrence Seaway , on the Canadian side of the river, to bypass Niagara Falls.

The Niagara River features two large islands and several smaller ones.

Grand Island and Navy Island , the two largest, are on the American and Canadian sides, respectively.

Goat Island and the small Luna Island divide Niagara Falls into three sections: Horseshoe Falls , Bridal Veil Falls , and American Falls .

Unity Island lies further upstream, adjacent to the city of Buffalo .

The Niagara River and its tributaries, Tonawanda Creek and the Welland River , formed part of the final section of the Erie Canal and Welland Canal. After leaving Lockport , the Erie Canal heads southwest into Tonawanda Creek . Upon entering the Niagara River, watercraft proceed south to the final lock , where a short canal section allows boats to bypass turbulent shoal water and enter Lake Erie. The Welland Canals used the Welland River to connect to the Niagara River south of the falls, enabling water traffic to safely re-enter the river and continue to Lake Erie.

History [ edit ] Watercolour by Elizabeth Simcoe depicting the Niagara River from Queenston Heights, c.

1793 Niagara River at Queenston, Ontario , then known as Queenstown, Upper Canada, c.

1805 watercolour The Niagara River and Falls have been known outside of North America since the late 17th century, when Father Louis Hennepin , a French explorer, first witnessed them. He wrote about his travels in A New Discovery of a Vast Country in America (1698).

[ 9 ] The Niagara River was the site of the earliest recorded railway in America. It was an inclined wooden tramway built by John Montresor (1736–1799), a British military engineer, in 1764.  Called "The Cradles" and "The Old Lewiston Incline", it featured loaded carts pulled up wooden rails by rope. It facilitated the movement of goods over the Niagara Escarpment in present-day Lewiston, New York .

[ 10 ] In 1781, the Niagara Purchase was signed, involving a 6.5-kilometre-wide (4.0 mi) strip of land bordering the west bank of the Niagara River, connecting Lake Erie and Lake Ontario.

[ 11 ] Several battles occurred along the Niagara River, which was historically defended by Fort George (Canadian side) and Fort Niagara (American side) at the mouth of the river and Fort Erie (Canadian side) at the head of the river. These forts were important during the Seven Years' War (known as the French and Indian War in the United States) and the American Revolutionary War . The Battle of Queenston Heights took place near the river in the War of 1812 .

The river was an important route to liberation before the American Civil War , as many African Americans escaping slavery on the Underground Railroad crossed it to find freedom in Canada. The Freedom Crossing Monument stands on the bank of the river in Lewiston to commemorate the courage of the escaping slaves and the local volunteers who helped them secretly cross the river.

In the 1880s, the Niagara River became the first waterway in the world harnessed for large-scale generation of hydroelectricity .

[ 12 ] [ 13 ] On the Canadian side of the river the provincial agency Niagara Parks Commission maintains all of the shoreline property, including Fort Erie, except the sites of Fort George (a National Historic Site maintained federally by Parks Canada ), as a public greenspace and environmental heritage.

On the American side, the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation maintains several state parks adjacent to Niagara Falls and the Niagara River.

Today, the river is the namesake of Niagara Herald Extraordinary at the Canadian Heraldic Authority .

Crossings [ edit ] Main article: List of crossings of the Niagara River The Niagara River has a long history of both road and rail bridges spanning the river, both upstream and downstream of the Falls. This history includes numerous bridges that have fallen victim to the harsh conditions of the Niagara Gorge , such as landslides and icepacks.
