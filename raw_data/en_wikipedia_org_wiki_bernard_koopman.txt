**Bernard Osgood Koopman** (January 19, 1900– August 18, 1981) was a French-born American mathematician, known for his work in [ergodic theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergodic_theory "Ergodic theory"), the [foundations of probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_probability "Foundations of probability"), [statistical theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_theory "Statistical theory") and [operations research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_research "Operations research").

After living in France and Italy, Koopman emigrated to the United States in 1915. Koopman was a student of [George David Birkhoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_David_Birkhoff "George David Birkhoff") and his initial work concentrated on [dynamical systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system "Dynamical system") and [mathematical physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_physics "Mathematical physics").

In 1931/1932, Koopman and [John von Neumann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann "John von Neumann") proposed a Hilbert space formulation of classical mechanics, known as the [Koopman–von Neumann classical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koopman%E2%80%93von_Neumann_classical_mechanics "Koopman–von Neumann classical mechanics").

During [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II"), he joined the Anti-Submarine Warfare Operations Research Group (ASWORG, later ORG) in [Washington, D.C.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C. "Washington, D.C."), directed by [Philip M. Morse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_M._Morse "Philip M. Morse"), to work for the U.S. Navy.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Koopman#cite_note-in-memoriam-1) The work of Koopman and his colleagues at ASWORG concerned the development of techniques for the [US Navy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Navy "US Navy") to hunt [U-boats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U-boat "U-boat").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Koopman#cite_note-2) The theoretical work laid the foundations for [search theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_theory "Search theory") which subsequently became a field of its own within [operations research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_research "Operations research").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Koopman#cite_note-3) Their results remained classified _Confidential_ for many years after the war; after 1955 Koopman set out to publish three articles on easily declassifiable portions of the work in the Journal of the [Operations Research Society of America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_Research_Society_of_America "Operations Research Society of America"). He wrote down the results in detailed form in the book _Search and Screening_ which was declassified in 1958.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Koopman#cite_note-4) A large part of his work is a systematization of the work performed by his group at ASWORG; the portions on optimum allocation of search effort and on probabilistic aspects of search theory were developed by Koopman himself.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Koopman#cite_note-in-memoriam-1)

The [Pitman–Koopman–Darmois theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitman%E2%80%93Koopman%E2%80%93Darmois_theorem "Pitman–Koopman–Darmois theorem") states that the only families of probability distributions that admit a [sufficient statistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sufficient_statistic "Sufficient statistic") whose dimension remains bounded as the sample size increases are [exponential families](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_family "Exponential family").

Koopman had two daughters from his first wife Mary Louise Harvey who died in 1946. In 1948 he married Jane Bridgman, daughter of his Harvard professor of thermodynamics, [Percy Williams Bridgman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percy_Williams_Bridgman "Percy Williams Bridgman"), and they had three more daughters.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Koopman#cite_note-in-memoriam-1)

Koopman's mother, née Louise Osgood, was a first cousin of [William Fogg Osgood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Fogg_Osgood "William Fogg Osgood"),[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Koopman#cite_note-in-memoriam-1) and his father, Augustus Koopman (1869-1914), was a well known painter.
