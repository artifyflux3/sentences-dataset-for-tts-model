For the reduction of transmittance by scattering, see Scattering .

Earth's atmospheric transmittance over 1 nautical mile sea level path (infrared region [ 1 ] ). Because of the natural radiation of the hot atmosphere, the intensity of radiation is different from the transmitted part.

Transmittance of ruby in optical and near-IR spectra. Note the two broad blue and green absorption bands and one narrow absorption band on the wavelength of 694 nm, which is the wavelength of the ruby laser .

Electromagnetic radiation can be affected in several ways by the medium in which it propagates.  It can be scattered , absorbed , and reflected and refracted at discontinuities in the medium.  This page is an overview of the last 3.  The transmittance of a material and any surfaces is its effectiveness in transmitting radiant energy ; the fraction of the initial (incident) radiation which propagates to a location of interest (often an observation location). This may be described by the transmission coefficient .

Surface Transmittance [ edit ] Hemispherical transmittance [ edit ] Hemispherical transmittance of a surface, denoted T , is defined as [ 2 ] T = Φ Φ e t Φ Φ e i , {\displaystyle T={\frac {\Phi _{\mathrm {e} }^{\mathrm {t} }}{\Phi _{\mathrm {e} }^{\mathrm {i} }}},} where Φ e t is the radiant flux transmitted by that surface into the hemisphere on the opposite side from the incident radiation; Φ e i is the radiant flux received by that surface.

Hemispheric transmittance may be calculated as an integral over the directional transmittance described below.

Spectral hemispherical transmittance [ edit ] Spectral hemispherical transmittance in frequency and spectral hemispherical transmittance in wavelength of a surface, denoted T ν and T λ respectively, are defined as [ 2 ] T ν ν = Φ Φ e , ν ν t Φ Φ e , ν ν i , {\displaystyle T_{\nu }={\frac {\Phi _{\mathrm {e} ,\nu }^{\mathrm {t} }}{\Phi _{\mathrm {e} ,\nu }^{\mathrm {i} }}},} T λ λ = Φ Φ e , λ λ t Φ Φ e , λ λ i , {\displaystyle T_{\lambda }={\frac {\Phi _{\mathrm {e} ,\lambda }^{\mathrm {t} }}{\Phi _{\mathrm {e} ,\lambda }^{\mathrm {i} }}},} where Φ e,ν t is the spectral radiant flux in frequency transmitted by that surface into the hemisphere on the opposite side from the incident radiation; Φ e,ν i is the spectral radiant flux in frequency received by that surface; Φ e,λ t is the spectral radiant flux in wavelength transmitted by that surface into the hemisphere on the opposite side from the incident radiation; Φ e,λ i is the spectral radiant flux in wavelength received by that surface.

Directional transmittance [ edit ] Directional transmittance of a surface, denoted T Ω , is defined as [ 2 ] T Ω Ω = L e , Ω Ω t L e , Ω Ω i , {\displaystyle T_{\Omega }={\frac {L_{\mathrm {e} ,\Omega }^{\mathrm {t} }}{L_{\mathrm {e} ,\Omega }^{\mathrm {i} }}},} where L e,Ω t is the radiance transmitted by that surface into the solid angle Ω; L e,Ω i is the radiance received by that surface.

Spectral directional transmittance [ edit ] Spectral directional transmittance in frequency and spectral directional transmittance in wavelength of a surface, denoted T ν,Ω and T λ,Ω respectively, are defined as [ 2 ] T ν ν , Ω Ω = L e , Ω Ω , ν ν t L e , Ω Ω , ν ν i , {\displaystyle T_{\nu ,\Omega }={\frac {L_{\mathrm {e} ,\Omega ,\nu }^{\mathrm {t} }}{L_{\mathrm {e} ,\Omega ,\nu }^{\mathrm {i} }}},} T λ λ , Ω Ω = L e , Ω Ω , λ λ t L e , Ω Ω , λ λ i , {\displaystyle T_{\lambda ,\Omega }={\frac {L_{\mathrm {e} ,\Omega ,\lambda }^{\mathrm {t} }}{L_{\mathrm {e} ,\Omega ,\lambda }^{\mathrm {i} }}},} where L e,Ω,ν t is the spectral radiance in frequency transmitted by that surface; L e,Ω,ν i is the spectral radiance received by that surface; L e,Ω,λ t is the spectral radiance in wavelength transmitted by that surface; L e,Ω,λ i is the spectral radiance in wavelength received by that surface.

Luminous transmittance [ edit ] In the field of photometry (optics) , the luminous transmittance of a filter is a measure of the amount of luminous flux or intensity transmitted by an optical filter . It is generally defined in terms of a standard illuminant (e.g. Illuminant A, Iluminant C, or Illuminant E). The luminous transmittance with respect to the standard illuminant is defined as: T l u m = ∫ ∫ 0 ∞ ∞ I ( λ λ ) T ( λ λ ) V ( λ λ ) d λ λ ∫ ∫ 0 ∞ ∞ I ( λ λ ) V ( λ λ ) d λ λ {\displaystyle T_{lum}={\frac {\int _{0}^{\infty }I(\lambda )T(\lambda )V(\lambda )d\lambda }{\int _{0}^{\infty }I(\lambda )V(\lambda )d\lambda }}} where: I ( λ λ ) {\displaystyle I(\lambda )} is the spectral radiant flux or intensity of the standard illuminant (unspecified magnitude).

T ( λ λ ) {\displaystyle T(\lambda )} is the spectral transmittance of the filter V ( λ λ ) {\displaystyle V(\lambda )} is the luminous efficiency function The luminous transmittance is independent of the magnitude of the flux or intensity of the standard illuminant used to measure it, and is a dimensionless quantity .

Internal Transmittance [ edit ] Optical Depth [ edit ] By definition, internal transmittance is related to optical depth and to absorbance as T = e − − τ τ = 10 − − A , {\displaystyle T=e^{-\tau }=10^{-A},} where τ is the optical depth; A is the absorbance.

Beer–Lambert law [ edit ] Main article: Beer–Lambert law The Beer–Lambert law states that, for N attenuating species in the material sample, τ τ = ∑ ∑ i = 1 N τ τ i = ∑ ∑ i = 1 N σ σ i ∫ ∫ 0 ℓ ℓ n i ( z ) d z , {\displaystyle \tau =\sum _{i=1}^{N}\tau _{i}=\sum _{i=1}^{N}\sigma _{i}\int _{0}^{\ell }n_{i}(z)\,\mathrm {d} z,} A = ∑ ∑ i = 1 N A i = ∑ ∑ i = 1 N ε ε i ∫ ∫ 0 ℓ ℓ c i ( z ) d z , {\displaystyle A=\sum _{i=1}^{N}A_{i}=\sum _{i=1}^{N}\varepsilon _{i}\int _{0}^{\ell }c_{i}(z)\,\mathrm {d} z,} where σ i is the attenuation cross section of the attenuating species i in the material sample; n i is the number density of the attenuating species i in the material sample; ε i is the molar attenuation coefficient of the attenuating species i in the material sample; c i is the amount concentration of the attenuating species i in the material sample; ℓ is the path length of the beam of light through the material sample.

Attenuation cross section and molar attenuation coefficient are related by ε ε i = N A ln ⁡ ⁡ 10 σ σ i , {\displaystyle \varepsilon _{i}={\frac {\mathrm {N_{A}} }{\ln {10}}}\,\sigma _{i},} and number density and amount concentration by c i = n i N A , {\displaystyle c_{i}={\frac {n_{i}}{\mathrm {N_{A}} }},} where N A is the Avogadro constant .

In case of uniform attenuation, these relations become [ 3 ] τ τ = ∑ ∑ i = 1 N σ σ i n i ℓ ℓ , {\displaystyle \tau =\sum _{i=1}^{N}\sigma _{i}n_{i}\ell ,} A = ∑ ∑ i = 1 N ε ε i c i ℓ ℓ .

{\displaystyle A=\sum _{i=1}^{N}\varepsilon _{i}c_{i}\ell .} Cases of non-uniform attenuation occur in atmospheric science applications and radiation shielding theory for instance.
