In the latter context, there are variations in how biomass is defined, e.g., only from plants, [ 2 ] from plants and algae, [ 3 ] from plants and animals.

[ 4 ] The vast majority of biomass used for bioenergy does come from plants and fecal matter. Bioenergy is a type of renewable energy that the bioenergy industry claims has the potential to assist with climate change mitigation .

[ 5 ] IUPAC definition biomass : Material produced by the growth of microorganisms, plants or animals.

[ 6 ] Uses in different contexts [ edit ] Ecology [ edit ] Biomass (ecology) , the mass of living biological organisms in a given area or ecosystem at a given time. This can be the biomass of particular species or the biomass of a particular community or habitat .

Energy [ edit ] Biomass (energy) , biomass used for energy production or in other words: biological mass used as a renewable energy source (usually produced through agriculture , forestry or aquaculture methods) Bioenergy , energy sources derived from biological material Solid fuel , forms of bioenergy that are solid Biofuel Energy crops Biotechnology [ edit ] Biomass is also used as a term for the mass of microorganisms that are used to produce industrial products like enzymes and medicines .

[ citation needed ] Bioproducts [ edit ] Examples of emerging bioproducts or biobased products include biofuels, bioenergy, biochar , starch-based and cellulose-based ethanol , bio-based adhesives, biochemicals, [ 7 ] [ 8 ] bioplastics , biogas/biomethane, [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] and hydrogen from biogas.

[ 12 ] [ additional citation(s) needed ] Biological wastewater treatment [ edit ] In biological wastewater treatment processes, such as the activated sludge process , the term "biomass" is used to denote the mass of bacteria and other microorganisms that break down pollutants in wastewater .

[ 13 ] : 243 The biomass forms part of sewage sludge .

Others [ edit ] Biomass (satellite) - an Earth observation satellite Waste biomass fibre - potential source for cleaner production of textiles References [ edit ] ^ Houghton, R. A.
