Definition [ edit ] If M is a manifold and P is a connection on M , that is a vector-valued 1-form on M which is a projection on T M such that P a b P b c = P a c , then the cocurvature R ¯ ¯ P {\displaystyle {\bar {R}}_{P}} is a vector-valued 2-form on M defined by R ¯ ¯ P ( X , Y ) = ( Id − − P ) [ P X , P Y ] {\displaystyle {\bar {R}}_{P}(X,Y)=(\operatorname {Id} -P)[PX,PY]} where X and Y are vector fields on M .
