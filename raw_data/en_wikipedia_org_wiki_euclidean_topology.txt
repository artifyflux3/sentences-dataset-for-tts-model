( June 2025 ) In mathematics, and especially general topology , the Euclidean topology is the natural topology induced on n {\displaystyle n} -dimensional Euclidean space R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} by the Euclidean metric .

Definition [ edit ] The Euclidean norm on R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} is the non-negative function ‖ ‖ ⋅ ⋅ ‖ ‖ : R n → → R {\displaystyle \|\cdot \|:\mathbb {R} ^{n}\to \mathbb {R} } defined by ‖ ( p 1 , … … , p n ) ‖ := p 1 2 + ⋯ ⋯ + p n 2 .

{\displaystyle \left\|\left(p_{1},\ldots ,p_{n}\right)\right\|~:=~{\sqrt {p_{1}^{2}+\cdots +p_{n}^{2}}}.} Like all norms , it induces a canonical metric defined by d ( p , q ) = ‖ ‖ p − − q ‖ ‖ .

{\displaystyle d(p,q)=\|p-q\|.} The metric d : R n × × R n → → R {\displaystyle d:\mathbb {R} ^{n}\times \mathbb {R} ^{n}\to \mathbb {R} } induced by the Euclidean norm is called the Euclidean metric or the Euclidean distance and the distance between points p = ( p 1 , … … , p n ) {\displaystyle p=\left(p_{1},\ldots ,p_{n}\right)} and q = ( q 1 , … … , q n ) {\displaystyle q=\left(q_{1},\ldots ,q_{n}\right)} is d ( p , q ) = ‖ ‖ p − − q ‖ ‖ = ( p 1 − − q 1 ) 2 + ( p 2 − − q 2 ) 2 + ⋯ ⋯ + ( p i − − q i ) 2 + ⋯ ⋯ + ( p n − − q n ) 2 .

{\displaystyle d(p,q)~=~\|p-q\|~=~{\sqrt {\left(p_{1}-q_{1}\right)^{2}+\left(p_{2}-q_{2}\right)^{2}+\cdots +\left(p_{i}-q_{i}\right)^{2}+\cdots +\left(p_{n}-q_{n}\right)^{2}}}.} In any metric space , the open balls form a base for a topology on that space.

[ 1 ] The Euclidean topology on R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} is the topology generated by these balls. 
In other words, the open sets of the Euclidean topology on R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} are given by (arbitrary) unions of the open balls B r ( p ) {\displaystyle B_{r}(p)} defined as B r ( p ) := { x ∈ ∈ R n : d ( p , x ) < r } , {\displaystyle B_{r}(p):=\left\{x\in \mathbb {R} ^{n}:d(p,x)<r\right\},} for all real r > 0 {\displaystyle r>0} and all p ∈ ∈ R n , {\displaystyle p\in \mathbb {R} ^{n},} where d {\displaystyle d} is the Euclidean metric.

Properties [ edit ] When endowed with this topology, the real line R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } is a T 5 space . 
Given two subsets say A {\displaystyle A} and B {\displaystyle B} of R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } with A ¯ ¯ ∩ ∩ B = A ∩ ∩ B ¯ ¯ = ∅ ∅ , {\displaystyle {\overline {A}}\cap B=A\cap {\overline {B}}=\varnothing ,} where A ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle {\overline {A}}} denotes the closure of A , {\displaystyle A,} there exist open sets S A {\displaystyle S_{A}} and S B {\displaystyle S_{B}} with A ⊆ ⊆ S A {\displaystyle A\subseteq S_{A}} and B ⊆ ⊆ S B {\displaystyle B\subseteq S_{B}} such that S A ∩ ∩ S B = ∅ ∅ .

{\displaystyle S_{A}\cap S_{B}=\varnothing .} [ 2 ] See also [ edit ] Hilbert space – Type of vector space in math List of Banach spaces List of topologies – List of concrete topologies and topological spaces References [ edit ] ^ Metric space#Open and closed sets.2C topology and convergence ^ Steen, L.
