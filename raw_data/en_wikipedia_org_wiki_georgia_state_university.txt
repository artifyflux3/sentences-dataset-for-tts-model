[ 15 ] Founded in 1913, it is one of the University System of Georgia 's four research universities. It is also the second largest institution of higher education by enrollment based in Georgia with a student enrollment of around 50,000, including approximately 33,000 undergraduate and graduate students at the main campus downtown .

[ 16 ] [ 17 ] Georgia State is classified among " R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research spending and doctorate production ".

[ 18 ] The university is the most comprehensive public institution in Georgia, offering more than 250-degree programs in over 100 fields of study spread across 10 academic colleges and schools.

[ 19 ] Georgia State has two libraries: University Library , which is split between Library North and Library South on the main campus and also divided among the Perimeter College campuses, and Law Library, which is located on the main campus. Together, both libraries contain over 13 million holdings and serve as federal document depositories.

[ 3 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] Georgia State has a $2.5 billion economic impact in Georgia.

[ 22 ] Georgia State University's intercollegiate athletics teams, the Georgia State Panthers , compete in NCAA Division I 's Sun Belt Conference . Georgia State is a founding member of the Sun Belt Conference.

History [ edit ] Initially intended as a night school, Georgia State University was established in 1913 as the Georgia School of Technology 's Evening School of Commerce.

[ 23 ] A reorganization of the University System of Georgia in the 1930s led to the school becoming the Atlanta Extension Center of the University System of Georgia and allowed night students to earn degrees from several colleges in the University System.

[ 24 ] During this time, the school was divided into two divisions: Georgia Evening College and Atlanta Junior College.

[ 25 ] In September 1947, the school became affiliated with the University of Georgia and was named the Atlanta Division of the University of Georgia.

[ 26 ] For its first four decades, the school was treated as an offsite department of its parent institution, Georgia Tech, until 1947, and UGA after 1947. Accordingly, its chief executive was called a director.

[ 27 ] However, in 1955, the Board of Regents made it an autonomous four-year college under the name Georgia State College of Business Administration.

[ 28 ] Walter Sparks, who had served as director since 1927, became the newly autonomous institution's first president. In 1961, other programs at the school had grown large enough that the name was shortened to Georgia State College.

[ 27 ] It became Georgia State University in 1969.

[ 29 ] The first African-American student became enrolled at Georgia State in 1962, a year after the integration of the University of Georgia and Georgia Tech .

[ 30 ] [ 31 ] Annette Lucille Hall was a Lithonia social studies teacher who enrolled in the course of the Institute on Americanism and Communism, a course required for all Georgia social studies teachers.

[ 32 ] The Peachtree Road Race was founded in 1970 by Georgia State cross-country coach and dean of men Tim Singleton, heading it in its first six years before turning it over to the Atlanta Track Club.

[ 33 ] In 1995, the Georgia Board of Regents accorded Georgia State "research university" status, joining the University of Georgia , the Georgia Institute of Technology , and Augusta University .

[ 34 ] [ 35 ] View of (from L-R) the Sports Arena and Library South on Decatur Street Expansion periods [ edit ] 1913–1975 [ edit ] Over its 100-plus-year history, Georgia State's growth has required the acquisition and construction of more space to suit its needs. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, numerous buildings were constructed as part of a major urban renewal project, such as the Pullen Library in 1966, Classroom South in 1968, the expansion of the Pullen Library in 1968, the Arts and Humanities Building in 1970, the 10-story General Classroom Building in 1971 (now called Langdale Hall), the Sports Arena in 1973, and the 12-story Urban Life Building in 1974.

[ 36 ] In addition, a raised platform and walkway system was constructed to connect these buildings over Decatur Street and various parking structures.

[ 37 ] 1980–1989 [ edit ] In the 1980s, another round of expansion took place with the acquisition of the former Atlanta Municipal Auditorium in 1979, [ 38 ] which was subsequently converted into Alumni Hall in 1982 and then to Dahlberg Hall in 2010, [ 39 ] and currently houses Georgia State's administrative offices.

[ 40 ] That same year, the College of Law was founded in the Urban Life Building, [ 41 ] and the Title Building on Decatur Street was acquired and converted into the College of Education's headquarters and classroom space.

[ 42 ] In 1988, the nine-story Library South was constructed on the south side of Decatur Street, which was connected to the Pullen Library via a three-story high foot bridge (officially referred to as a "link") and effectively doubled the library's space.

[ 43 ] 1990–2004 [ edit ] Georgia State continued this growth into the 1990s, with the expansion of Alumni Hall in 1991, [ 44 ] the opening of the Natural Science Center in 1992, [ 45 ] and the acquisition of the former C&S Bank Building on Marietta Street in 1993, which is now the home of the Robinson College of Business.

[ 44 ] Georgia State's first move into the Fairlie-Poplar district was the acquisition and renovation of the Standard Building, the Haas-Howell Building, and the Rialto Theater in 1996.

[ 44 ] The Standard and Haas-Howell buildings house classrooms, offices, and practice spaces for the School of Music, and the Rialto is home to Georgia State's Jazz Studies program and an 833-seat theater.

[ 46 ] In 1998, the Student Center was expanded toward Gilmer Street [ 44 ] and provided a new 400-seat auditorium and space for exhibitions and offices for student clubs.

[ 47 ] A new Student Recreation Center opened on the corner of Piedmont Avenue and Gilmer Street in 2001.

[ 44 ] In 2002, the five-story Helen M. Aderhold Learning Center opened on Luckie Street [ 48 ] amid controversy over the demolition of historical buildings on its block.

[ 49 ] Most recently, in 2004, the Andrew Young School of Policy Studies was moved to the former Wachovia Bank Building at Five Points .

[ 50 ] 2005–2015 [ edit ] After the release of the 2006 master plan update, a host of new building activities occurred on campus. A $20 million refurbishment to the Pullen Library complex was completed during the 2006–07 school year.

[ 51 ] Multiple new units of on-campus housing were built, including the 2,000 bed University Commons in 2007, a new dormitory named Freshman Hall (later renamed Patton Hall) in 2009 and a conversion of a former Wyndham Garden Hotel and a Baymont Inn & Suites into a new 1,100 occupancy dormitory named Piedmont North.

[ 44 ] [ 52 ] [ 53 ] New Greek housing was built in 2010 along Edgewood Avenue .

[ 44 ] The Citizens Trust Building on Piedmont Avenue was purchased by the university to make room for offices and student services in 2007.

[ 44 ] The Parker H. Petit Science Center was completed in 2010, opening up state-of-the-art science laboratories and teaching space.

[ 44 ] In 2013, Georgia State started operating from the original home of the Trust Company of Georgia and the SunTrust Bank, the 25 Park Place Building, a 26-floor skyscraper located adjacent to Woodruff Park in the heart of downtown Atlanta. The building currently houses many academic units of the College of Arts and Sciences, including the Dean's Office, the University Advisement Center, and facilities of the School of Public Health. In May 2015, the College of Law was moved to its new building at 89 Park Place after the land was donated to the university.

[ 44 ] [ 54 ] 2016–present [ edit ] The newest incarnation of the university's strategic plan gives an outline of the university's growth from 2011 until 2016 and a brief overview that will be amended for up to 2021.

[ 55 ] In 2016, an extension to the Petit Science Center was completed. Plans exist for the building of graduate student housing behind the center.

[ 55 ] On May 31, 2012, the athletics department released a new facilities master plan.

[ 56 ] The plan includes upgrades and renovations to the GSU Sports Arena [ 57 ] including new outdoor sand volleyball courts (which have since been completed) [ 58 ] as well as plans to build new baseball, softball, and soccer stadiums.

[ 59 ] [ 60 ] [ 61 ] These would replace the current stadiums in Panthersville . In May 2014, the university announced its intentions to pursue the 77-acre (312,000 m 2 ) Turner Field site once the Atlanta Braves Major League Baseball club moves into Truist Park in 2017. The university intends to retrofit Turner Field into a 30,000-seat open-air football stadium and build a new baseball field on the site of the former Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium , incorporating the wall where Hank Aaron hit his record-breaking 715th home run. Additional retail and student housing development is also planned for the parking areas surrounding Turner Field.

[ 62 ] On December 21, 2015, the Atlanta Fulton County Recreation Authority announced that Georgia State's bid to redevelop Turner Field had been accepted.

[ 63 ] On August 18, 2016, Georgia State and the Atlanta-Fulton County Recreation Authority reached a tentative purchase agreement for Turner Field, and the purchase and redevelopment plan was approved by the Board of Regents on November 9, 2016.

[ 64 ] [ 65 ] On January 5, 2017, Georgia State's acquisition of Turner Field, since renamed Georgia State Stadium , was officially closed, with the stadium conversion project beginning in February 2017.

[ 66 ] Georgia State Stadium hosted its first game on August 31, 2017.

[ 67 ] In June 2021, M. Brian Blake became Georgia State University's first African-American and person of color president.

[ 68 ] In November 2024, Georgia State University secured $107 million to initiate significant upgrades to its downtown campus as part of a transformative plan featuring nine projects aimed at revitalizing and reimagining the campus experience. The effort was bolstered by an $80 million donation from the Robert W. Woodruff Foundation, marking the largest gift ever made by the foundation to a University System of Georgia institution.

[ 69 ] Consolidation with Georgia Perimeter College [ edit ] On January 5, 2015, news broke that Georgia State and Georgia Perimeter College would merge.

[ 70 ] Over a year later, the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia approved the merger of Georgia State University and Georgia Perimeter College, a 2-year college with five campuses. The board also announced that the president of Georgia State would remain the president of the combined university, which retained the name Georgia State University.

[ 71 ] The merger created the largest university in the state of Georgia at about 52,000 students.

[ 72 ] Since Georgia State's consolidation with Georgia Perimeter College in 2016, graduation rates at Perimeter College have almost tripled.

[ 73 ] Campus [ edit ] View of (from L-R) the Student Center, Urban Life Building, and University Center From Georgia State's days as a single-building night school into the university it is today, Georgia State has built itself into the heart of urban Downtown Atlanta . Whereas the school's nickname—dating from the early 1960s—of "the Concrete Campus" was once a source of mild embarrassment, [ 74 ] the name has been embraced by the university community.

[ 75 ] The university embraced the slogan, "a part of the city, not apart from the city" as its growth into Downtown Atlanta increased.

[ 76 ] This has led to the widening of sidewalks around the campus and a focus on Decatur Street as becoming the "Main Street" of the campus.

[ 77 ] 25 Park Place [ edit ] 25 Park Place is a mixed-use classroom and office building that houses several departments at Georgia State University. The building was previously the Trust Company of Georgia Building, and before Georgia State University acquiring the building was the SunTrust Bank Building. The Georgia State University Foundation acquired the building in 2006 for $52 million.

[ 78 ] Sparks Hall [ edit ] Sparks Hall was the first building designed and built specifically for the school. It was designed by the Atlanta architectural firm of Cooper, Barrett, Skinner, Woodbury, and Cooper. Construction took place between 1952 and 1955 and cost about $2 million. The first classes were held in the building on April 21, 1955. On June 8, 1960, the building was named for George McIntosh Sparks, former president of the college.

[ 79 ] Currently, the building houses Undergraduate Admissions and the Financial Management Center. It also primarily houses classrooms and computer laboratory space.

Housing [ edit ] After the 1996 Summer Olympics were held in Atlanta, Georgia State acquired its first on-campus dormitories in the 2,000-bed Olympic Village housing complex located at the southeast corner of Centennial Olympic Park Drive (formerly Techwood Drive) and North Avenue that was used to board Olympic athletes during the Games.

[ 80 ] The Village was later sold to the Georgia Institute of Technology and renamed the North Avenue Apartments.

[ 81 ] University Lofts [ edit ] In August 2002, [ 44 ] the 450-bed University Lofts opened at the corner of Edgewood Avenue and Courtland Street on the northeast side of campus as housing for undergraduate students and student-athletes, as well as students with families and graduate students.

[ 82 ] In 2008, the Lofts were converted into multiperson dormitories as well as apartment-style dorms, raising the bed counts to its current number of 550 residents in 231 apartments.

[ 83 ] University Commons [ edit ] On August 10, 2007, Georgia State opened the University Commons, a US$165 million complex housing 1,992 students, occupying a city block bounded by Ellis Street, Piedmont Avenue , John Wesley Dobbs Avenue and Jesse Hill Jr. Drive.

[ 84 ] A GSU economics professor estimated the new dorm could have an economic impact of $10–12 million on downtown Atlanta .

[ 84 ] The university plans to ultimately accommodate 20% of its enrollment in housing near the downtown campus.

[ 84 ] With the planned opening of University Commons, it was announced on March 7, 2007, that the Georgia Institute of Technology was acquiring the Olympic Village housing, which is located across North Avenue from the institute.

[ 85 ] In 2011, the Commons were voted "best overall dorms in the country" by DormSplash.com.

[ 86 ] This was followed in 2012 by The Fiscal Times rating the Commons as some of the most luxurious dormitories in the country, rated third most "insanely luxurious." [ 87 ] Patton Hall [ edit ] Hurt Park In the fall of 2009, Georgia State opened a 325-bed residence hall exclusively for freshman students, originally named Freshman Hall. Renamed Patton Hall in 2013 after former Georgia State President Carl Patton, [ 88 ] [ 89 ] the dorms are located on the corner of Piedmont Avenue and Edgewood Avenue , approximately 0.2 miles from the heart of GSU's campus.

[ 90 ] The facility includes a 24/4.5 dining hall offering breakfast, lunch, and dinner in a buffet style.

[ 91 ] The dining hall is open to all Georgia State students, and all residents of Patton Hall are required to have meal plans for the dining hall.

[ 92 ] Greek housing [ edit ] During the 2010 academic year, Georgia State opened its Greek Housing facility, located adjacent to Patton Hall on Edgewood Avenue .

[ 44 ] Each of the nine townhomes in the complex features a chapter room, kitchen, and bedrooms ranging from 9–19 beds.

[ 93 ] Piedmont North [ edit ] Most recently, Georgia State acquired two hotels in downtown Atlanta, the Wyndham Garden Hotel and Baymont Inn and Suites on Piedmont Avenue .

[ 53 ] The hotels and grounds have been renovated and changed into dorms, Piedmont North Buildings A and B, contributing to the university's transformation into a more traditional campus.

[ 94 ] The complex now includes living and study space for approximately 1,100 students, as well as green space, recreational areas, and a brand new 12,000-square-foot (1,100 m 2 ) dining hall, the Piedmont North Dining Hall.

[ 52 ] Piedmont Central [ edit ] On May 14, 2014, the ground was broken on a new, 1,152-bed residence hall named Piedmont Central.

[ 95 ] The hall received its first residents in fall semester of 2016.

[ 95 ] The facility includes a 15,000-square-foot dining facility, conference rooms, communal kitchens, study rooms, and laundry facilities.

[ 96 ] A Georgia State police vehicle on campus in Atlanta Campus security [ edit ] The department is composed of more than 160 state-sworn police officers, 60 full-time security guards, 10 part-time security guards, 16 communications dispatchers and eight staff members, making it the largest campus law enforcement agency in Georgia.

[ 97 ] Perimeter College [ edit ] Perimeter College consists of five different campuses around the Metro Atlanta region. Campuses in Alpharetta , Clarkston , Decatur , Dunwoody , and Newton County each offer different amenities. The Alpharetta campus consists of two buildings, with students enrolled at that campus having free access to a nearby private gym, as well as access to the other Perimeter campus amenities. The Clarkston campus is a full campus with athletic facilities, (tennis courts, soccer field, gym) and 14 buildings. The Decatur campus includes greenhouses, tennis courts, as well as six academic buildings including a Student Success Center. The Dunwoody campus includes a gym, weight room, soccer field, tennis courts, an observatory, a gazebo, and eight academic buildings. The Newton campus consists of a baseball field, a softball field, a health and recreation center, and two academic buildings.

Lewis College of Nursing and Health Professions College of the Arts College of Arts & Sciences College of Education and Human Development J. Mack Robinson College of Business College of Law School of Public Health Institute for Biomedical Sciences Honors College Perimeter College † † Unlike the other colleges that make up the university, students accepted to Perimeter College only have access to the five suburban campuses associated with that college and not the main campus. A Perimeter College student must apply for acceptance to the main downtown campus for access to bachelor's degrees.

[ 113 ] Research and innovation [ edit ] GSU is one of four research universities in the University System of Georgia .  In 2023, U.S. News & World Report ranked GSU the No. 2 most innovative university in the nation.

[ 114 ] Georgia State University's research and development expenditures of over $200 million for the 2018 fiscal year ranked first in the nation among universities without an engineering or medical school.

[ 115 ] [ 116 ] In 2013, Georgia State University was one of six universities in the nation and the only in Georgia to be named a "Next Generation University" by New America for its proven commitment to expanding enrollment, focus on the neediest of students, and the success of its ethnically diverse student body.

[ 117 ] Libraries [ edit ] View of the plaza with Library North, Library South, and the Classroom South Building in the background Georgia State houses three university libraries. Additionally, many academic departments provide libraries for their students. The University Library (formerly known as the William Russell Pullen Library), housed in Library North and Library South, contains more than 1.4 million volumes, including 8,000 active serials and nearly 22,000 media materials. The library provides access to numerous electronic periodical and resource indexes (many with full text), more than 14,000 electronic journals, and about 30,000 electronic books. It is also a Federal Document Depository and holds more than 820,000 government documents with electronic access to many additional titles.

[ 118 ] From December 2015 through February 2016, the University Library received significant media attention for several armed robberies and other crimes against GSU students within the facility.

[ 119 ] SURAgrid [ edit ] On August 31, 2006, Georgia State announced that it would be participating in a supercomputing grid with the installation of an IBM P575 Supercomputer in its Network Operations Center . Through an initiative known as SURAGrid, eventually, 24 universities in 15 states throughout the Southeast United States will form the research backbone and at its peak, the network will be able to perform over 10 trillion calculations per second.

University of Georgia and Kennesaw State University are also part of the SURAGrid.

[ 120 ] Physics and astronomy [ edit ] Physics at Georgia State is split between physics and astronomy. Areas of research range from atomic physics, biophysics , condensed matter physics , neurophysics , nuclear physics , and physics education and innovative instruction. The astronomy program uses many observatories, including the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona and the Small and Moderate Aperture Research Telescope System (or SMARTS) in Chile , and the CHARA array on Mount Wilson Observatory in Los Angeles County, California , Hard Labor Creek Observatory in Rutledge, Georgia , and the Urban Life Observatory, all of which are operated by Georgia State. Astronomy is now also a partner in the Apache Point Observatory 3.5-m telescope.

[ 121 ] Biology [ edit ] Biological research at Georgia State is divided into four categories; applied and environmental microbiology (AEM), cellular molecular biology and physiology (CMBP), molecular genetics and biochemistry, and neurobiology and behavior. The AEM program concentrates on the environmental, industrial, and medical aspects of microbiology, including bioremediation , toxicology, genetics, cellular responses, and natural product biosynthesis.

[ 122 ] [ 123 ] Cellular and molecular biology and physiology focuses on the function and regulation of eukaryotic cells and organisms, doing research including signal transduction, cancer immunology, virology, immunology, and diabetes research.

[ 124 ] The MGB program ranges from lower eukaryotic programmed cell death to viral RNA replication.

[ 125 ] The neurobiology and behavior program is involved in research focusing on topics such as neurobiology, behavior, hormonal action, developmental neurobiology, and vertebrate sexual plasticity, to name a few.

[ 126 ] Georgia State is currently the only university in the United States operating a BSL-4 lab (the highest bio-safety level) at level 4 conditions. These labs are currently used to investigate herpes B virus , hantavirus , and ebola .

[ 127 ] Research centers [ edit ] The College of Arts and Science is home to several centers, inst,itutes and areas of focus, under which the departments of chemistry, biology, psychology, and other college-wide departments can collaborate on interdisciplinary subjects.

[ 128 ] The Language Research Center specializes in language research, with bonobos and chimpanzees .

Kanzi , a male bonobo raised at the center, has become famous after learning to communicate via lexigram with his researchers.

[ 129 ] The Center for Neuromics promotes the study of the nervous system using informatics and computational approaches.

The Neuroscience Institute comprises neuroscience faculty in all departments across the College of Arts and Sciences.

The Center for Research on Atypical Development and Learning was founded in 1998 to stimulate basic and applied research spanning developmental, clinical, and education psychology, neuropsychology, special education, and speech-language pathology.

[ 130 ] Likewise, several university-level institutes exist, allowing collaboration between departments throughout the university as a whole.

The Center for Behavioral Neuroscience is composed of more than 60 researchers from seven other Atlanta institutions, including Emory University and Georgia Tech . The institute was originally established in 1998 by a grant from the Robert W. Woodruff Foundation and expanded in November 1999 to become one of the National Science Foundation 's Science and Technology Centers .
