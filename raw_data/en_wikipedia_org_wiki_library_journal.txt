Website www .libraryjournal .com ISSN 0363-0277 OCLC 818916619 Library Journal is an American trade publication for librarians . It was founded in 1876 by Melvil Dewey . It reports news about the library world, emphasizing public libraries , and offers feature articles about aspects of professional practice. It also reviews library-related materials and equipment. Each year since 2008, the Journal has assessed public libraries and awarded stars in their Star Libraries program.

Its "Library Journal Book Review" does pre-publication reviews of several hundred popular and academic books each month.

With a circulation of approximately 100,000, Library Journal has the highest circulation of any librarianship journal, according to Ulrich's .

[ 1 ] Library Journal's original publisher was Frederick Leypoldt , whose company became R. R. Bowker . Reed International later merged into Reed Elsevier and purchased Bowker in 1985; they published Library Journal until 2010, when it was sold to Media Source Inc.

, owner of the Junior Library Guild and The Horn Book Magazine .

[ 2 ] Early history [ edit ] The cover of Volume 3, No. 2 of Library Journal , published in 1878 Founded in 1876 by Melvil Dewey , Library Journal originally declared itself to be the "official organ of the library associations of America and of the United Kingdom", according to the journal's self-description in 1878.

[ 3 ] Indeed, the journal's original title was American Library Journal , though "American" was removed from the title after the first year.

[ 4 ] Its early issues focused on the growth and development of libraries, with feature articles by such prominent authors as R. R. Bowker , Charles Cutter , and Melvil Dewey, and focusing on cataloging, indexing, and lending schemes. In its early issues, Bowker discussed cataloging principles; Cutter, creator of the Cutter Expansive Classification system, developed his ideas; and managing editor Dewey made recommendations for early library circulation systems. Initially, Library Journal did not review books unless they related to librarians' professional interests, but then, like now, the journal ran articles on collection development and ads from publishers recommending their forthcoming books for libraries to purchase.

Early issues of Library Journal were a forum for librarians throughout Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States to share news, discussions of their libraries' ideas and practices, and reports of professional activities such as meetings and conferences. In an 1878 prospectus, the journal stressed its importance by noting that small libraries, in particular, could gain the "costly experience and practical advice" of the largest libraries. Regular reading of Library Journal , the prospectus declared, would make "the librarian worth more to the library, and the library worth more to the people." [ 5 ] In the Notes and Queries section, librarians shared reports of how their library managed common problems, and they maintained a constant exchange of questions and answers about authorship and reader's advisory. Two prominent sections, the Bibliography (compiled by Cutter) and Pseudonyms and Antonyms (compiled by James L. Whitney), served as reference resources for librarians.
