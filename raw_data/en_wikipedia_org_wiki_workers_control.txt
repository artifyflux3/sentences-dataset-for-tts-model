Find sources: "Workers' control" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( November 2015 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Workers' control is participation in the management of factories and other commercial enterprises by the people who work there.  It has been variously advocated by anarchists , socialists , communists , social democrats , distributists and Christian democrats , and has been combined with various socialist and mixed economy systems.

Workers' councils are a form of workers' control.

Council communism , such as in the early Soviet Union , advocates workers' control through workers' councils and factory committees .

Syndicalism advocates workers' control through trade unions .

Guild socialism advocates workers' control through a revival of the guild system.

Participatory economics represents a recent variation on the idea of workers' control.

Workers' control can be contrasted to control of the economy via the state, such as nationalization and central planning (see state socialism ) versus control of the means of production by owners, which workers can achieve through employer provided stock purchases, direct stock purchases, etc., as found in capitalism.

Historical examples by country [ edit ] Algeria [ edit ] During the Algerian Revolution , peasants and workers took control of factories, farms and offices that were abandoned, with the help of UGTA militants. Around 1,000 enterprises were placed under workers' control in 1962, with that number climbing to 23,000+ in the following years. The FLN passed laws in the newly independent Algeria which partially institutionalized workers' control, creating a bureaucracy around workers' councils that centralized them. This caused massive corruption among new managers as well productivity and enthusiasm in the project to fall, leading to numerous strikes by workers in protest. Following a military coup in 1965, workers' control efforts were sabotaged by the government which began to centralize the economy in the hands of the state, denying workers control.

[ 1 ] Argentina [ edit ] In 1973, with the end of the self-proclaimed Argentine Revolution , there was a wave of strikes and workplace occupations that rocked the country as the first elections were held, mainly in state-owned industry. 500 occupations of workplaces were taken out overall, with 350 occurring between the 11th and 15 June, mostly of media outlets, health centres and public transport and government administration. These occupations were predominantly done in support of Peronism , and failed to achieve any long lasting results on the eve of the Dirty War .

[ 1 ] During the Argentine Great Depression , hundreds of workplaces were occupied and ran according to the principles of workers' control by angered unemployed people. In 2014, around 311 of these were still around, being run as worker cooperatives.

[ 2 ] Some of the notable examples include: Brukman textile factory FaSinPat Hotel Bauen Tandanor shipyard Australia [ edit ] In Northern Queensland from 1908 to 1920, the IWW and the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union organized a degree of workers' control among meat industry workers.

[ 3 ] From 1971 to 1990, Australia saw a massive wave of workers' control corresponding with strikes all over the country. Some authors have argued that the green bans constitute a form of workers' control.

Germany [ edit ] Germany has a history of "Mitbestimmung" (Codetermination) since 1891 (see Codetermination in Germany ).  The Weimar Republic required workers' consultative committees in every business employing 20 people, which the Nazi government abolished. Works councils were authorized by the Allied Control Council in 1946 and required by the West German government in 1952; codetermination has been mandatory in all large companies (2,000 employees) since 1976.
