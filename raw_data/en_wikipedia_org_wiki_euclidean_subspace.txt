For a subspace that contains the zero vector or a fixed origin, see Linear subspace .

In geometry , a flat is an affine subspace , i.e. a subset of an affine space that is itself an affine space.

[ 1 ] Particularly, in the case the parent space is Euclidean , a flat is a Euclidean subspace which inherits the notion of distance from its parent space.

In an n -dimensional space , there are k -flats of every dimension k from 0 to n ; flats one dimension lower than the parent space, ( n − 1) -flats, are called hyperplanes .

The flats in a plane (two-dimensional space) are points , lines , and the plane itself; the flats in three-dimensional space are points, lines, planes, and the space itself. 
The definition of flat excludes non-straight curves and non-planar surfaces , which are subspaces having different notions of distance: arc length and geodesic length , respectively.

Flats occur in linear algebra , as geometric realizations of solution sets of systems of linear equations .

A flat is a manifold and an algebraic variety , and is sometimes called a linear manifold or linear variety to distinguish it from other manifolds or varieties.

Descriptions [ edit ] By equations [ edit ] A flat can be described by a system of linear equations .  For example, a line in two-dimensional space can be described by a single linear equation involving x and y : 3 x + 5 y = 8.

{\displaystyle 3x+5y=8.} In three-dimensional space, a single linear equation involving x , y , and z defines a plane, while a pair of linear equations can be used to describe a line.  In general, a linear equation in n variables describes a hyperplane, and a system of linear equations describes the intersection of those hyperplanes.  Assuming the equations are consistent and linearly independent , a system of k equations describes a flat of dimension n − k .

Parametric [ edit ] A flat can also be described by a system of linear parametric equations .  A line can be described by equations involving one parameter : x = 2 + 3 t , y = − − 1 + t z = 3 2 − − 4 t {\displaystyle x=2+3t,\;\;\;\;y=-1+t\;\;\;\;z={\frac {3}{2}}-4t} while the description of a plane would require two parameters: x = 5 + 2 t 1 − − 3 t 2 , y = − − 4 + t 1 + 2 t 2 z = 5 t 1 − − 3 t 2 .

{\displaystyle x=5+2t_{1}-3t_{2},\;\;\;\;y=-4+t_{1}+2t_{2}\;\;\;\;z=5t_{1}-3t_{2}.\,\!} In general, a parameterization of a flat of dimension k would require k parameters, e.g.

t 1 , …, t k .

Operations and relations on flats [ edit ] Intersecting, parallel, and skew flats [ edit ] An intersection of flats is either a flat or the empty set .

If each line from one flat is parallel to some line from another flat, then these two flats are parallel . Two parallel flats of the same dimension either coincide or do not intersect; they can be described by two systems of linear equations which differ only in their right-hand sides.

If flats do not intersect, and no line from the first flat is parallel to a line from the second flat, then these are skew flats . It is possible only if sum of their dimensions is less than dimension of the ambient space.

Join [ edit ] For two flats of dimensions k 1 and k 2 there exists the minimal flat which contains them, of dimension at most k 1 + k 2 + 1 . If two flats intersect, then the dimension of the containing flat equals to k 1 + k 2 minus the dimension of the intersection.

Properties of operations [ edit ] These two operations (referred to as meet and join ) make the set of all flats in the Euclidean n -space a lattice and can build systematic coordinates for flats in any dimension, leading to Grassmann coordinates or dual Grassmann coordinates. For example, a line in three-dimensional space is determined by two distinct points or by two distinct planes.

However, the lattice of all flats is not a distributive lattice .
If two lines ℓ 1 and ℓ 2 intersect, then ℓ 1 ∩ ℓ 2 is a point. If p is a point not lying on the same plane, then (ℓ 1 ∩ ℓ 2 ) + p = (ℓ 1 + p ) ∩ (ℓ 2 + p ) , both representing a line. But when ℓ 1 and ℓ 2 are parallel, this distributivity fails, giving p on the left-hand side and a third parallel line on the right-hand side.

Euclidean geometry [ edit ] The aforementioned facts do not depend on the structure being that of Euclidean space (namely, involving Euclidean distance ) and are correct in any affine space . In a Euclidean space: There is the distance between a flat and a point. (See for example Distance from a point to a plane and Distance from a point to a line .) There is the distance between two flats, equal to 0 if they intersect. (See for example Distance between two parallel lines (in the same plane) and Skew lines § Distance .) There is the angle between two flats, which belongs to the interval [0, π/2] between 0 and the right angle . (See for example Dihedral angle (between two planes). See also Angles between flats .)
