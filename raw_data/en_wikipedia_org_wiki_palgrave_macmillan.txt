of employees 170 Official website palgrave .com 2008 conference booth Palgrave Macmillan is a British academic and trade publishing company headquartered in the London Borough of Camden . Its programme includes textbooks, journals, monographs, professional and reference works in print and online. It maintains offices in London, New York , Shanghai , Melbourne , Sydney , Hong Kong , Delhi and Johannesburg .

Palgrave Macmillan was created in 2000 when St. Martin's Press in the US united with Macmillan Publishers in the UK to combine their worldwide academic publishing operations. The company was known simply as Palgrave until 2002, but has since been known as Palgrave Macmillan.

[ 1 ] It is a subsidiary of Springer Nature . Until 2015, it was part of the Macmillan Group and therefore wholly owned by the German publishing company Holtzbrinck Publishing Group (which still owns a controlling interest in Springer Nature). As part of Macmillan, it was headquartered at the Macmillan campus in Kings Cross, London with other Macmillan companies including Pan Macmillan , Nature Publishing Group and Macmillan Education , having moved from Basingstoke in 2014.

History [ edit ] Palgrave is named after the Palgrave family. Classical historian Sir Francis Palgrave , who founded the Public Record Office , and his four sons were all closely tied with Macmillan Publishers in the 19th century: Francis Turner Palgrave acted as assistant private secretary to future Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone , before creating his Palgrave's Golden Treasury [ 2 ] in the English Language in 1861, which was published by Macmillan and became a standard work for almost a century.

Inglis Palgrave was the editor of The Palgrave Dictionary of Political Economy , which was first published by Macmillan in 1894, 1896 and 1899 and the inspiration for The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics was published in 1987.

[ 3 ] He was a banker and editor of The Economist .

[ 4 ] Reginald Palgrave was Clerk of the House of Commons and wrote A History of the House of Commons , which Macmillan published in 1869.

William Gifford Palgrave was an Arabic scholar . He wrote a two-volume work describing his travels and adventures for Macmillan called Narrative of a Year's Journey through Central and Eastern Arabia (1865), which was the most widely read book on the region until the account by T. E. Lawrence was published.

Palgrave Macmillan publishes The Statesman's Yearbook , an annual reference work which gives a political, economic and social overview of every country of the world. In 2008, Palgrave Macmillan published The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics , 2nd edition, edited by Steven N. Durlauf and Lawrence E. Blume . In 2009, Palgrave Macmillan made over 4,500 scholarly ebooks available to libraries.

Distribution clients [ edit ] Palgrave Macmillan represents the sales, marketing and distribution interests of W. H. Freeman , Worth Publishers, Sinauer Associates , and University Science Books outside the US, Canada, Australia and the Far East.

Palgrave Macmillan previously distributed I.B. Tauris in the U.S. and Canada; and Manchester University Press , Pluto Press , and Zed Books in the U.S.

In Australia, Palgrave represents both the Macmillan Group, including Palgrave Macmillan and Nature Publishing Group , and a variety of other academic publishers, including Acumen Publishing, Atlas & Co, Bedford-St. Martin's , Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press , Continuum International Publishing Group , David Fulton , Gerald Duckworth and Company , W.
