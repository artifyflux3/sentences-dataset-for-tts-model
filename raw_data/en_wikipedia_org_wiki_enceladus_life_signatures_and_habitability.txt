[ 1 ] [ 2 ] The Principal Investigator is Christopher P. McKay , an astrobiologist at NASA Ames Research Center , [ 3 ] and the managing NASA center is Goddard Space Flight Center . No details of the mission have been made public, but observers speculate that it would be a plume-sampling orbiter mission.

[ 4 ] The two finalists, announced on 20 December 2017, are Dragonfly to Titan, and CAESAR (Comet Astrobiology Exploration Sample Return) which is a sample-return mission from comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko .

[ 5 ] Although ELSAH was not selected for launch in this instance, it received technology development funds to prepare it for future mission competitions.

[ 6 ] The funds are meant to develop techniques that limit spacecraft contamination and thereby enable life detection measurements on cost-capped missions.
