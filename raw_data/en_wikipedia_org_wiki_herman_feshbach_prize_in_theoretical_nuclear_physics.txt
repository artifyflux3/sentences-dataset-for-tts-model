The $10,000 prize is in honor of Herman Feshbach of MIT . The prize, inaugurated in 2014, is awarded to one person or is shared among two to three persons when all of the recipients are credited with the same accomplishment.

^ For lifetime contributions to nuclear many-body theory including identifying mechanisms for saturation and relating the Skyrme interaction to fundamental nuclear forces; and for initiating and leading efforts to understand the nucleon using lattice QCD (Laudatio).

^ For his pioneering contributions to our understanding of quantum chromodynamics at high energy density and laying the theoretical foundations of experimental ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions. His work has been a crucial guide to experiments at RHIC and LHC, and he has mentored a generation of young theorists.

(Laudatio) ^ For pioneering work in developing tools to characterize the structure of the nucleon within QCD and for showing how its properties can be probed through experiments; this work not only illuminates the nucleon theoretically but also acts as a driver of experimental programs worldwide.

(Laudatio) ^ For pioneering the development of quantum Monte Carlo techniques to solve key problems in nuclear structure physics, cold atom physics, and dense matter theory of relevance to neutron stars (Laudatio) ^ For his pioneering contributions to the understanding of strongly interacting matter under extreme conditions, and for establishing the foundations of the theory of quark-gluon plasma and its hydrodynamical behavior.

(Laudatio) ^ For seminal theoretical studies of fundamental symmetries in nuclei, including radioactive nuclear decays, parity-violating nucleon-nucleon interactions, and chiral dynamics of mesons and baryons.
