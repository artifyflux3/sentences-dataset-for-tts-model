Tom Bethell Born July 17, 1936 London Died February 12, 2021 (2021-02-12) (aged 84) Washington, D.C.

Occupation(s) Journalist, writer Tom Bethell ( / b ə ˈ θ ɛ l / ; July 17, 1936 – February 12, 2021) [ 1 ] was an American journalist who wrote mainly on economic and scientific issues.

Life and career [ edit ] Bethell was born and raised in London , [ 2 ] England. He was educated at Downside School and Trinity College, Oxford . A resident of the District of Columbia , he lived in Virginia , Louisiana , and California . From 1962 to 1965 he taught math at Woodberry Forest School, Virginia. He was married to Donna R. Fitzpatrick of Washington, D.C.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] He was a senior editor of The American Spectator and was for 25 years a media fellow of the Hoover Institution . He was Washington editor of Harper's , and an editor of the Washington Monthly .

[ 6 ] In 1980, he received a Gerald Loeb Award Honorable Mention for Columns/Editorial for "Fooling With the Budget." [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] Jim Garrison investigation [ edit ] Bethell was hired as a researcher by New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison to assist with his prosecution of Clay Shaw for conspiracy to assassinate John F. Kennedy .

[ 10 ] Bethell gave no credence to Garrison's charges that Shaw was involved.

[ 11 ] Shaw was acquitted after the jury deliberated for about an hour.

Controversy [ edit ] In 1976, Bethell wrote a controversial article for Harper’s Magazine titled "Darwin's Mistake". According to Bethell there is no independent criterion of fitness and natural selection is a tautology .

[ 12 ] Bethell also stated that Darwin's theory was on "the verge of collapse" and natural selection had been "quietly abandoned" by his supporters.

[ 13 ] These claims were disputed by biologists.

[ 12 ] [ 13 ] The paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould wrote a rebuttal to Bethell's arguments.

[ 13 ] Bethell was a member of the Group for the Scientific Reappraisal of the HIV-AIDS Hypothesis, [ 14 ] which denies that HIV causes AIDS . In The Politically Incorrect Guide to Science (2005), he promoted denial of the existence of man-made global warming , AIDS denialism , and denial of evolution (which Bethell denied was "real science").

[ 15 ] Bethell endorsed the intelligent design documentary-style film Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed .

[ 16 ] Bethell died from complications of Parkinson's disease at his home in Washington, D.C.

in February 2021, aged 84.
