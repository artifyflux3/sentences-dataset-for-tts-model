He was the son of Thomas Henry and was born in Manchester England .

Life [ edit ] William Henry was apprenticed to Thomas Percival and later worked with John Ferriar & John Huit at the Manchesters Infirmary.

[ citation needed ] He began to study medicine at University of Edinburgh in 1795, taking his medical in 1807, but ill-health [ a ] interrupted his practice as a physician , and he devoted his time mainly to chemical research, especially with regard to gases. One of his best-known papers (published in Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society , 1803) describes experiments on the quantity of gases absorbed by water at different temperatures and under different pressures.

[ 3 ] His results are known today as Henry's law . His other papers deal with gas-analysis, fire-damp , illuminating gas , the composition of hydrochloric acid and of ammonia , urinary and other morbid concretions , and the disinfecting powers of heat. His Elements of Experimental Chemistry (1799) enjoyed considerable vogue in its day, [ 4 ] going through eleven editions in 30 years.

[ 5 ] He was one of the founders of the Mechanics' Institute , the original precursor of University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology .

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in February 1809, having been awarded their prestigious Copley Medal in 1808.
