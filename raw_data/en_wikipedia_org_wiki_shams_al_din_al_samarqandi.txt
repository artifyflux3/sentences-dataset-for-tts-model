He wrote works on theology , logic , philosophy , mathematics and astronomy which are important in their own right, but also provide information about the works of other astronomers. His treatise , Risala fi adab al-bahth , is a discussion of dialectic reasoning as used by the ancient Greeks . He wrote Synopsis of Astronomy , and produced a star catalogue for the year 1276–1277.

In his preparation of the work, al-Samarqandi consulted the works of other Muslim mathematicians such as Ibn al-Haytham , Omar Khayyam , Al-Abbās ibn Said al-Jawharī , Nasir al-Din al-Tusi , and Athīr al-Dīn al-Abharī .
