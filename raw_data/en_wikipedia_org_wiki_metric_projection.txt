[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Formal definition [ edit ] Formally, let X be a metric space with distance metric d , and let M be a fixed subset of X . Then the metric projection associated with M , denoted p M , is the following set-valued function from X to M : p M ( x ) = arg ⁡ ⁡ min y ∈ ∈ M d ( x , y ) {\displaystyle p_{M}(x)=\arg \min _{y\in M}d(x,y)} Equivalently: p M ( x ) = { y ∈ ∈ M : d ( x , y ) ≤ ≤ d ( x , y ′ ) ∀ ∀ y ′ ∈ ∈ M } = { y ∈ ∈ M : d ( x , y ) = d ( x , M ) } {\displaystyle p_{M}(x)=\{y\in M:d(x,y)\leq d(x,y')\forall y'\in M\}=\{y\in M:d(x,y)=d(x,M)\}} The elements in the set arg ⁡ ⁡ min y ∈ ∈ M d ( x , y ) {\displaystyle \arg \min _{y\in M}d(x,y)} are also called elements of best approximation . This term comes from constrained optimization : we want to find an element nearer to x , under the constraint that the solution must be a subset of M . The function p M is also called an operator of best approximation .

[ citation needed ] Chebyshev sets [ edit ] In general, p M is set-valued, as for every x , there may be many elements in M that have the same nearest distance to x . In the special case in which p M is single-valued, the set M is called a Chebyshev set . As an example, if ( X , d ) is a Euclidean space (R n with the Euclidean distance ), then a set M is a Chebyshev set if and only if it is closed and convex .

[ 3 ] Continuity [ edit ] If M is non-empty compact set , then the metric projection p M is upper semi-continuous , but might not be lower semi-continuous. But if X is a normed space and M is a finite-dimensional Chebyshev set, then p M is continuous.

[ citation needed ] Moreover, if X is a Hilbert space and M is closed and convex, then p M is Lipschitz continuous with Lipschitz constant 1.

[ citation needed ] Applications [ edit ] Metric projections are used both to investigate theoretical questions in functional analysis and for practical approximation methods.

[ 4 ] They are also used in constrained optimization .
