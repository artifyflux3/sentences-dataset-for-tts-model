Europeans are the focus of European ethnology , the field of anthropology related to the various ethnic groups that reside in the states of Europe . Groups may be defined by common ancestry, language, faith, historical continuity, etc. There are no universally accepted and precise definitions of the terms " ethnic group " and " nationality ", but in the context of European ethnography in particular, the terms ethnic group , people , nationality and ethno-linguistic group are used as mostly synonymous. Preference may vary in usage with respect to the situation specific to the individual countries of Europe, and the context in which they may be classified by those terms.

[ 1 ] The total number of national minority populations in Europe is estimated at 105 million people, or 14% of 770 million Europeans in 2002.

[ 2 ] The Russians are the most populous among Europeans, with a population of roughly 120 million.

[ 3 ] Overview [ edit ] Further information: Demographics of Europe In 2021, the number of non-EU nationals living in EU members states was 23.7 million (5.3% of the EU population). The countries with the largest population of non-nationals were Germany, Spain, France and Italy. These four Member States represented 70.3% of all non-EU nationals living in the EU Member States.

[ 4 ] The population of the European Union , with some 450 million residents, accounts for two thirds of the current European population.

Both Spain and the United Kingdom are special cases, in that the designation of nationality , Spanish and British , may controversially [ citation needed ] take ethnic aspects, subsuming various regional ethnic groups (see nationalisms and regionalisms of Spain and native populations of the United Kingdom ).

Switzerland is a similar case, but the linguistic subgroups of the Swiss are discussed in terms of both ethnicity and language affiliations.

( June 2019 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Of the total population of Europe of some 740 million (as of 2010), close to 90% (or some 650 million) fall within three large branches of Indo-European languages , these being: Germanic , including Danish , Dutch , English , Faroese , Frisian , German , Gutnish , Hunsrik , Icelandic , Limburgish , Low Saxon , Luxembourgish , Norwegian , Scots , Swedish , and Yiddish .

[ 5 ] Afrikaans , a daughter language of Dutch, is spoken by some South African and Namibian migrant populations.

Romance , including Aromanian , Arpitan , Asturian , Catalan , Corsican , French and other Langues d'oïl , Lombard , Friulian , Galician , Istro-Romanian , Italian , Ligurian , Ladin , Ladino , Megleno-Romanian , Occitan , Portuguese , Romanian , Romansh , Sardinian , Spanish , Venetian and Sicilian .

Slavic , including Belarusian , Bosnian , Bulgarian , Croatian , Czech , Kashubian , Macedonian , Polish , Russian , Rusyn , Serbian , Silesian , Slovak , Slovenian , Sorbian and Ukrainian .

Three stand-alone Indo-European languages do not fall within larger sub-groups and are not closely related to those larger language families, but are still languages that are used in areas considered part of the European continent: Greek (about 12 million) Albanian (about 9 million) Armenian (about 3.5 million) In addition, there are also smaller sub-groups within the Indo-European languages of Europe, including: Baltic , including Latvian , Lithuanian , Samogitian and Latgalian .

Celtic , including Breton , Cornish , Irish , Manx , Welsh , and Scottish Gaelic .

Iranic , mainly Ossetian and Tats in the Caucasus .

Indo-Aryan is represented by the Romani language spoken by Roma people of eastern Europe, and is at root related to the Indo-Aryan languages of the Indian subcontinent .

Besides the Indo-European languages, there are other language families on the European continent which are considered unrelated to Indo-European: Uralic languages , including Estonian , Finnish , Hungarian , Komi , Livonian , Mari , Mordvin , Sámi , Samoyedic , and Udmurt .

Turkic languages , including Azerbaijani , Bashkir , Chuvash , Gagauz , Kazakh , Nogai , Tatar , Turkish , Crimean Tatar .

Semitic languages , including: Suret / Turoyo (dialects of Neo-Aramaic spoken in parts of eastern Turkey and the Caucasus by ethnic Assyrians ), Hebrew (spoken by some Jewish populations), and Maltese .

Arabic is spoken by some migrant communities from the Middle East and North Africa.

Kartvelian languages (also known as South Caucasian languages), including Georgian , Zan ( Mingrelian and Laz ), and Svan .

Northwest Caucasian languages , including Abkhaz , Abaza , Circassian ( Adyghe and Kabardian ), and Ubykh .

Northeast Caucasian languages , including Avar , Chechen , Dargin , Ingush , Lak , and Lezgian .

Language isolates : Basque , spoken in the Basque regions of Spain and France, is an isolate language, the only one in Europe, and is believed to be unrelated to any other living language; though it is related to the extinct Aquitanian language .

Mongolic languages exist in the form of Kalmyk , spoken in the South region of Russia.

History [ edit ] Prehistoric populations [ edit ] Further information: Genetic history of Europe , Prehistoric Europe , Eurasian nomads , Indo-European expansion , and Neolithic Revolution Simplified model for the demographic history of Europeans during the Neolithic period and the introduction of agriculture [ 6 ] The Basques have been found to descend from the population of the late Neolithic or early Bronze Age directly.

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] By contrast, Indo-European groups of Europe (the Centum , Balto-Slavic , and Albanian groups) migrated throughout most of Europe from the Pontic steppe . They are assumed to have developed in situ through admixture of earlier Mesolithic and Neolithic populations with Bronze Age, proto-Indo-Europeans .

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] The Finnic peoples are assumed to also be descended from Proto-Uralic populations further to the east, nearer to the Ural Mountains , that had migrated to their historical homelands in Europe by about 3,000 years ago.

[ 12 ] Reconstructed languages of Iron Age Europe include Proto-Celtic , Proto-Italic and Proto-Germanic , all of these Indo-European languages of the centum group, and Proto-Slavic and Proto-Baltic , of the satem group.  A group of Tyrrhenian languages appears to have included Etruscan , Rhaetian , Lemnian , and perhaps Camunic . A pre-Roman stage of Proto-Basque can only be reconstructed with great uncertainty.

Regarding the European Bronze Age , the only relatively likely reconstruction is that of Proto-Greek (ca. 2000 BC). A Proto-Italo-Celtic ancestor of both Italic and Celtic (assumed for the Bell beaker period), and a Proto-Balto-Slavic language (assumed for roughly the Corded Ware horizon) has been postulated with less confidence.

Old European hydronymy has been taken as indicating an early (Bronze Age) Indo-European predecessor of the later centum languages.

According to geneticist David Reich , based on ancient human genomes that his laboratory sequenced in 2016, Europeans descend from a mixture of four distinct ancestral components.

Gottfried Hensel in his 1741 Synopsis Universae Philologiae published one of the earliest ethno-linguistic map of Europe, showing the beginning of the pater noster in the various European languages and scripts.

[ 15 ] [ 16 ] In the 19th century, ethnicity was discussed in terms of scientific racism , and the ethnic groups of Europe were grouped into a number of " races ", Mediterranean , Alpine and Nordic , all part of a larger " Caucasian " group.

The beginnings of ethnic geography as an academic subdiscipline lie in the period following World War I, in the context of nationalism , and in the 1930s exploitation for the purposes of fascist and Nazi propaganda , so that it was only in the 1960s that ethnic geography began to thrive as a bona fide academic subdiscipline.

[ 17 ] The origins of modern ethnography are often traced to the work of Bronisław Malinowski , who emphasized the importance of fieldwork.

[ 18 ] The emergence of population genetics further undermined the categorisation of Europeans into clearly defined racial groups. A 2007 study on the genetic history of Europe found that the most important genetic differentiation in Europe occurs on a line from the north to the south-east (northern Europe to the Balkans), with another east–west axis of differentiation across Europe, separating the indigenous Basques , Sardinians and Sami from other European populations.
Despite these stratifications it noted the unusually high degree of European homogeneity: "there is low apparent diversity in Europe with the entire continent-wide samples only marginally more dispersed than single population samples elsewhere in the world." [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] Minorities [ edit ] Further information: Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities and European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages Further information: Multilingual countries and regions of Europe Gagauz people in Moldova Sámi family in Lapland of Finland, 1936 The total number of national minority populations in Europe is estimated at 105 million people, or 14% of Europeans.

[ 2 ] The member states of the Council of Europe in 1995 signed the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities . The broad aims of the convention are to ensure that the signatory states respect the rights of national minorities, undertaking to combat discrimination, promote equality, preserve and develop the culture and identity of national minorities, guarantee certain freedoms in relation to access to the media, minority languages and education and encourage the participation of national minorities in public life. The Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities defines a national minority implicitly to include minorities possessing a territorial identity and a distinct cultural heritage. By 2008, 39 member states had signed and ratified the convention, with the notable exception of France .

Indigenous minorities [ edit ] The definitions that apply to who is considered an indigenous minority group in Europe can vary widely. One criterion is the so-called "time element", or how long the original inhabitants of a land occupied it before the arrival of later settlers. As there is no fixed time frame, considering a specific group to be indigenous is often context-dependent.

[ 22 ] A number of ethnic groups in Europe claim indigenous status and are spread throughout the continent.

In Russia, the Uralic Nenets and Komi peoples in the north are considered to be indigenous peoples; the Nenets are divided into three distinct groups based on their way of life, Tundra, Forest, and Yaran, and have two autonomous regions that mention them as the majority inhabitants ( Nenets , Yamalo-Nenets ). Similarly, the Komi are divided into two main groups, the Zyryans and the Permiaks, which are individually divided into their own unique subgroupings.

[ 23 ] The Komi primarily live in the Komi Republic , though much of the population of the Republic are ethnic Russians. The Nenets are one of the 40 groups in Russia that are recognized as indigenous small-numbered peoples, while the Komi are seeking this recognition.

[ 24 ] The Circassians of southern Russia and the North Caucasus are another indigenous people to the country, though following the Circassian genocide , more Adyghe live in Turkey than in their ancestral homeland.

[ 25 ] In the Crimean Peninsula , the Turkic Crimean Tatars , Krymchaks and Crimean Karaites are indigenous peoples. The Crimean Tatars were the majority ethnic group of the Crimean Peninsula until the 19th century.

[ 26 ] Meanwhile, the Krymchaks and Karaites differ by their much smaller population size (around 1–2,000 each) and their adherence to Judaism , with more of both groups now residing in Israel . The Crimean Tatars were declared an indigenous peoples in the 1996 Constitution of Ukraine , [ 27 ] while plans were declared in 2021 to grant Karaites and other groups the same status.

In Scandinavia , which comprises Norway , Finland , and Sweden , the Sámi people inhabit the cultural region of Sápmi (which also includes parts of Russia). Up to today, the people have experienced great discrimination as an indigenous group, with the Norwegian and Swedish governments having previously been accused of policies of Norwegianization and Swedification against them.

[ 28 ] [ 29 ] While challenges regarding the rights of the Sámi remain, the Church of Sweden made a formal apology for its role in forced conversions, and outlined a one-year plan for reconciliation.

[ 30 ] In southern France and the Iberian Peninsula , Catalans , Basques , and Galicians each have their own unique regions and are considered indigenous peoples ( Galicia , Catalonia , and Basque Country ). They also have their own unique languages that denote their ethnic origins. This also applies to the Gaels , a Celtic ethnic group originally from Ireland , the Scottish Highlands , and the Isle of Man .

Although some groups arrived centuries ago, the vast majority of non-indigenous ethnic groups have arrived more recently, mostly in the 20th and 21st centuries. Often, they come from former colonies of the British, Dutch, French, Portuguese and Spanish empires.

European identity [ edit ] Historical [ edit ] Further information: History of Western civilization Personifications of Sclavinia , Germania , Gallia , and Roma , bringing offerings to Otto III ; from a gospel book dated 990.

Medieval notions of a relation of the peoples of Europe are expressed in terms of genealogy of mythical founders of the individual groups.
The Europeans were considered the descendants of Japheth from early times, corresponding to the division of the known world into three continents , the descendants of Shem peopling Asia and those of Ham peopling Africa . Identification of Europeans as " Japhetites " is also reflected in early suggestions for terming the Indo-European languages "Japhetic".

In this tradition, the Historia Brittonum (9th century) introduces a genealogy of the peoples of the Migration Period based on the sixth-century Frankish Table of Nations as follows: The first man that dwelt in Europe was Alanus, with his three sons, Hisicion, Armenon, and Neugio. Hisicion had four sons, Francus, Romanus, Alamanus, and Bruttus. Armenon had five sons, Gothus, Valagothus, Cibidus, Burgundus, and Longobardus. Neugio had three sons, Vandalus, Saxo, and Boganus.
From Hisicion arose four nations—the Franks , the Latins , the Germans , and Britons ; from Armenon, the Gothi , Valagothi , Cibidi , Burgundi , and Longobardi ; from Neugio, the Bogari , Vandali , Saxones , and Tarincgi . The whole of Europe was subdivided into these tribes.

[ 72 ] The text goes then on to list the genealogy of Alanus, connecting him to Japheth via eighteen generations.

European culture [ edit ] Main articles: Culture of Europe and Western culture European culture is largely rooted in what is often referred to as its "common cultural heritage".

[ 73 ] Due to the great number of perspectives which can be taken on the subject, it is impossible to form a single, all-embracing conception of European culture.

[ 74 ] Nonetheless, there are core elements which are generally agreed upon as forming the cultural foundation of modern Europe.

[ 75 ] One list of these elements given by K. Bochmann includes: [ 76 ] A common cultural and spiritual heritage derived from Greco-Roman antiquity, Christianity , the Renaissance and its Humanism , the political thinking of the Enlightenment , and the French Revolution , and the developments of Modernity , including all types of socialism ; [ 77 ] A rich and dynamic material culture that has been extended to the other continents as the result of industrialization and colonialism during the " Great Divergence "; [ 77 ] A specific conception of the individual expressed by the existence of, and respect for, a legality that guarantees human rights and the liberty of the individual ; [ 77 ] A plurality of states with different political orders, which are condemned to live together in one way or another; [ 77 ] Respect for peoples, states and nations outside Europe.

[ 77 ] Berting says that these points fit with "Europe's most positive realisations".

[ 78 ] The concept of European culture is generally linked to the classical definition of the Western world . In this definition, Western culture is the set of literary , scientific , political , artistic and philosophical principles which set it apart from other civilizations. Much of this set of traditions and knowledge is collected in the Western canon .

[ 79 ] The term has come to apply to countries whose history has been strongly marked by European immigration or settlement during the 18th and 19th centuries, such as the Americas , and Australasia , and is not restricted to Europe.

Religion [ edit ] Main articles: Religion in Europe and Christendom Further information: Christianity in Europe , Islam in Europe , Hinduism in Europe , and Buddhism in Europe Eurobarometer Poll 2005 chart results Since the High Middle Ages , most of Europe has been dominated by Christianity . There are three major denominations: Roman Catholic , Protestant and Eastern Orthodox , with Protestantism restricted mostly to Northern Europe , and Orthodoxy to East and South Slavic regions, Romania , Moldova , Greece , Cyprus , and Georgia . The Armenian Apostolic Church , part of the Oriental Church , is also in Europe – another branch of Christianity (world's oldest National Church).

Catholicism , while typically centered in Western Europe , also has a very significant following in Central Europe (especially among the Germanic , Western Slavic , Slovenian [ 80 ] [ 81 ] and Hungarian peoples/regions) as well as in Ireland (with some in Great Britain).

Christianity [ edit ] Christianity has been the dominant religion shaping European culture for at least the last 1700 years.

[ 82 ] [ 83 ] [ 84 ] [ 85 ] [ 86 ] Modern philosophical thought has very much been influenced by Christian philosophers such as St Thomas Aquinas and Erasmus, and throughout most of its history, Europe has been nearly equivalent to Christian culture .

[ 87 ] The Christian culture was the predominant force in western civilization , guiding the course of philosophy , art , and science .

[ 88 ] [ 89 ] The notion of "Europe" and the "Western World" has been intimately connected with the concept of " Christianity and Christendom " many even attribute Christianity for being the link that created a unified European identity .

[ 90 ] Christianity is still the largest religion in Europe; according to a 2011 survey, 76.2% of Europeans considered themselves Christians .

[ 91 ] [ 92 ] Also according to a study on Religiosity in the European Union in 2012, by Eurobarometer , Christianity is the largest religion in the European Union , accounting for 72% of the EU 's population.

[ 93 ] As of 2010 Catholics were the largest Christian group in Europe , accounting for more than 48% of European Christians. The second-largest Christian group in Europe were the Orthodox , who made up 32% of European Christians. About 19% of European Christians were part of the Protestant tradition.

[ 94 ] Russia is the largest Christian country in Europe by population, followed by Germany and Italy .

[ 94 ] According to Scholars, in 2017, Europe's population was 77.8% Christian (up from 74.9% 1970), [ 95 ] [ 96 ] these changes were largely result of the collapse of Communism and switching to Christianity in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc countries.

[ 95 ] Islam [ edit ] Islam has some tradition in the Balkans and the Caucasus due to conquest and colonization from the Ottoman Empire in the 16th to 19th centuries, as well as earlier though discontinued long-term presence in much of Iberia as well as Sicily .

Muslims account for the majority of the populations in Albania , Azerbaijan , Kosovo , Northern Cyprus (controlled by Turks ), and Bosnia and Herzegovina . Significant minorities are present in the rest of Europe. Russia also has one of the largest Muslim communities in Europe, including the Tatars of the Middle Volga and multiple groups in the Caucasus, including Chechens , Avars , Ingush and others. With 20th-century migrations, Muslims in Western Europe have become a noticeable minority. According to the Pew Forum , the total number of Muslims in Europe in 2010 was about 44 million (6%), [ 97 ] [ 98 ] while the total number of Muslims in the European Union in 2007 was about 16 million (3.2%).

[ 99 ] Judaism [ edit ] Judaism has a long history in Europe , but is a small minority religion, with France (1%) the only European country with a Jewish population in excess of 0.5%. The Jewish population of Europe is composed primarily of two groups , the Ashkenazi and the Sephardi . Ancestors of Ashkenazi Jews likely migrated to Central Europe at least as early as the 8th century , while Sephardi Jews established themselves in Spain and Portugal at least one thousand years before that. Jews originated in the Levant where they resided for thousands of years until the 2nd century AD, when they spread around the Mediterranean and into Europe, although small communities were known to exist in Greece as well as the Balkans since at least the 1st century BC. Jewish history was notably affected by the Holocaust and emigration (including Aliyah , as well as emigration to America ) in the 20th century. The Jewish population of Europe in 2010 was estimated to be approximately 1.4 million (0.2% of European population) or 10% of the world's Jewish population.

[ 100 ] In the 21st century, France has the largest Jewish population in Europe , [ 100 ] [ 101 ] followed by the United Kingdom, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.

[ 101 ] Secularisation [ edit ] From the 20th century, there has been significant secularization , notably in secularist France , Estonia and the Czech Republic.

Theism [ edit ] Currently, distribution of theism in Europe is very heterogeneous, with more than 95% in Poland, and less than 20% in the Czech Republic and Estonia. The 2005 Eurobarometer poll [ 102 ] found that 52% of EU citizens believe in God. According to a Pew Research Center Survey in 2012 the Religiously Unaffiliated ( Atheists and Agnostics ) make up about 18.2% of the European population in 2010.

[ 103 ] According to the same Survey the Religiously Unaffiliated make up the majority of the population in only two European countries: Czech Republic (76%) and Estonia (60%).

[ 103 ] Pan-European identity [ edit ] Main article: Pan-European identity " Pan-European identity " or " Europatriotism " is an emerging sense of personal identification with Europe, or the European Union as a result of the gradual process of European integration taking place over the last quarter of the 20th century, and especially in the period after the end of the Cold War , since the 1990s. The foundation of the OSCE following the 1990s Paris Charter has facilitated this process on a political level during the 1990s and 2000s.

From the later 20th century, 'Europe' has come to be widely used as a synonym for the European Union even though there are millions of people living on the European continent in non-EU member states. The prefix pan implies that the identity applies throughout Europe, and especially in an EU context, and 'pan-European' is often contrasted with national identity.
