The theory can be thought of as roughly the predicative part of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (ZFC) and is considerably weaker than it.

Axioms [ edit ] In its formulation, a Δ 0 formula is one all of whose quantifiers are bounded . This means any quantification is the form ∀ ∀ u ∈ ∈ v {\displaystyle \forall u\in v} or ∃ ∃ u ∈ ∈ v .

{\displaystyle \exists u\in v.} (See the Lévy hierarchy .) Axiom of extensionality : Two sets are the same if and only if they have the same elements.

Axiom of induction : φ( a ) being a formula , if for all sets x the assumption that φ( y ) holds for all elements y of x entails that φ( x ) holds, then φ( x ) holds for all sets x .

Axiom of empty set : There exists a set with no members, called the empty set and denoted {}.

Axiom of pairing : If x , y are sets, then so is { x , y }, a set containing x and y as its only elements.

Axiom of union : For any set x , there is a set y such that the elements of y are precisely the elements of the elements of x .

Axiom of Δ 0 -separation : Given any set and any Δ 0 formula φ( x ), there is a subset of the original set containing precisely those elements x for which φ( x ) holds. (This is an axiom schema .) Axiom of Δ 0 -collection : Given any Δ 0 formula φ( x , y ), if for every set x there exists a set y such that φ( x , y ) holds, then for all sets X there exists a set Y such that for every x in X there is a y in Y such that φ( x , y ) holds.

Some but not all authors include an Axiom of infinity KP with infinity is denoted by KPω. These axioms lead to close connections between KP, generalized recursion theory , and the theory of admissible ordinals .
KP can be studied as a constructive set theory by dropping the law of excluded middle , without changing any axioms.

Empty set [ edit ] If any set c {\displaystyle c} is postulated to exist, such as in the axiom of infinity, then the axiom of empty set is redundant because it is equal to the subset { x ∈ ∈ c ∣ ∣ x ≠ ≠ x } {\displaystyle \{x\in c\mid x\neq x\}} . Furthermore, the existence of a member in the universe of discourse, i.e., ∃x(x=x), is implied in certain formulations [ 1 ] of first-order logic , in which case the axiom of empty set follows from the axiom of Δ 0 -separation, and is thus redundant.

Comparison with Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory [ edit ] As noted, the above are weaker than ZFC as they exclude the power set axiom , choice, and sometimes infinity. Also the axioms of separation and collection here are weaker than the corresponding axioms in ZFC because the formulas φ used in these are limited to bounded quantifiers only.

The axiom of induction in the context of KP is stronger than the usual axiom of regularity , which amounts to applying induction to the complement of a set (the class of all sets not in the given set).

Related definitions [ edit ] A set A {\displaystyle A\,} is called admissible if it is transitive and ⟨ ⟨ A , ∈ ∈ ⟩ ⟩ {\displaystyle \langle A,\in \rangle } is a model of Kripke–Platek set theory.

An ordinal number α α {\displaystyle \alpha } is called an admissible ordinal if L α α {\displaystyle L_{\alpha }} is an admissible set.

L α α {\displaystyle L_{\alpha }} is called an amenable set if it is a standard model of KP set theory without the axiom of Δ 0 -collection.

Theorems [ edit ] Admissible sets [ edit ] The ordinal α is an admissible ordinal if and only if α is a limit ordinal and there does not exist a γ < α for which there is a Σ 1 (L α ) mapping from γ onto α .  If M is a standard model of KP, then the set of ordinals in M is an admissible ordinal.

Cartesian products exist [ edit ] Theorem: If A and B are sets, then there is a set A × B which consists of all ordered pairs ( a , b ) of elements a of A and b of B .

Proof: The singleton set with member a , written { a }, is the same as the unordered pair { a , a }, by the axiom of extensionality .

The singleton, the set { a , b }, and then also the ordered pair ( a , b ) := { { a } , { a , b } } {\displaystyle (a,b):=\{\{a\},\{a,b\}\}} all exist by pairing .
A possible Δ 0 -formula ψ ψ ( a , b , p ) {\displaystyle \psi (a,b,p)} expressing that p stands for the pair ( a , b ) is given by the lengthy ∃ ∃ r ∈ ∈ p ( a ∈ ∈ r ∧ ∧ ∀ ∀ x ∈ ∈ r ( x = a ) ) {\displaystyle \exists r\in p\,{\big (}a\in r\,\land \,\forall x\in r\,(x=a){\big )}} ∧ ∧ ∃ ∃ s ∈ ∈ p ( a ∈ ∈ s ∧ ∧ b ∈ ∈ s ∧ ∧ ∀ ∀ x ∈ ∈ s ( x = a ∨ ∨ x = b ) ) {\displaystyle \land \,\exists s\in p\,{\big (}a\in s\,\land \,b\in s\,\land \,\forall x\in s\,(x=a\,\lor \,x=b){\big )}} ∧ ∧ ∀ ∀ t ∈ ∈ p ( ( a ∈ ∈ t ∧ ∧ ∀ ∀ x ∈ ∈ t ( x = a ) ) ∨ ∨ ( a ∈ ∈ t ∧ ∧ b ∈ ∈ t ∧ ∧ ∀ ∀ x ∈ ∈ t ( x = a ∨ ∨ x = b ) ) ) .

{\displaystyle \land \,\forall t\in p\,{\Big (}{\big (}a\in t\,\land \,\forall x\in t\,(x=a){\big )}\,\lor \,{\big (}a\in t\land b\in t\land \forall x\in t\,(x=a\,\lor \,x=b){\big )}{\Big )}.} What follows are two steps of collection of sets, followed by a restriction through separation. All results are also expressed using set builder notation.

Firstly, given b {\displaystyle b} and collecting with respect to A {\displaystyle A} , some superset of A × × { b } = { ( a , b ) ∣ ∣ a ∈ ∈ A } {\displaystyle A\times \{b\}=\{(a,b)\mid a\in A\}} exists by collection .

The Δ 0 -formula ∃ ∃ a ∈ ∈ A ψ ψ ( a , b , p ) {\displaystyle \exists a\in A\,\psi (a,b,p)} grants that just A × × { b } {\displaystyle A\times \{b\}} itself exists by separation .

If P {\displaystyle P} ought to stand for this collection of pairs A × × { b } {\displaystyle A\times \{b\}} , then a Δ 0 -formula characterizing it is ∀ ∀ a ∈ ∈ A ∃ ∃ p ∈ ∈ P ψ ψ ( a , b , p ) ∧ ∧ ∀ ∀ p ∈ ∈ P ∃ ∃ a ∈ ∈ A ψ ψ ( a , b , p ) .

{\displaystyle \forall a\in A\,\exists p\in P\,\psi (a,b,p)\,\land \,\forall p\in P\,\exists a\in A\,\psi (a,b,p)\,.} Given A {\displaystyle A} and collecting with respect to B {\displaystyle B} , some superset of { A × × { b } ∣ ∣ b ∈ ∈ B } {\displaystyle \{A\times \{b\}\mid b\in B\}} exists by collection .

Putting ∃ ∃ b ∈ ∈ B {\displaystyle \exists b\in B} in front of that last formula and one finds the set { A × × { b } ∣ ∣ b ∈ ∈ B } {\displaystyle \{A\times \{b\}\mid b\in B\}} itself exists by separation .

Finally, the desired A × × B := ⋃ ⋃ { A × × { b } ∣ ∣ b ∈ ∈ B } {\displaystyle A\times B:=\bigcup \{A\times \{b\}\mid b\in B\}} exists by union .

Q.E.D.

Transitive containment [ edit ] Transitive containment is the principle that every set is contained in some transitive set . It does not hold in certain set theories, such as Zermelo set theory (though its inclusion as an axiom does not add consistency strength [ 2 ] ).

Theorem: If A is a set, then there exists a transitive set B such that A is a member of B .

Proof: We proceed by induction on the formula: ϕ ϕ ( A ) := ∃ ∃ B ( A ∈ ∈ B ∧ ∧ ⋃ ⋃ B ⊆ ⊆ B ) {\displaystyle \phi (A):=\exists B(A\in B\land \bigcup B\subseteq B)} Note that ⋃ ⋃ B ⊆ ⊆ B {\displaystyle \bigcup B\subseteq B} is another way of expressing that B is transitive.

The inductive hypothesis then informs us that ∀ ∀ a ∈ ∈ A ∃ ∃ b ( a ∈ ∈ b ∧ ∧ ⋃ ⋃ b ⊆ ⊆ b ) {\displaystyle \forall a\in A\,\exists b(a\in b\land \bigcup b\subseteq b)} .

By Δ 0 -collection , we have: ∃ ∃ C ∀ ∀ a ∈ ∈ A ∃ ∃ b ∈ ∈ C ( a ∈ ∈ b ∧ ∧ ⋃ ⋃ b ⊆ ⊆ b ) {\displaystyle \exists C\,\forall a\in A\,\exists b\in C(a\in b\land \bigcup b\subseteq b)} By Δ 0 -separation , the set { c ∈ ∈ C ∣ ∣ ⋃ ⋃ c ⊆ ⊆ c } {\displaystyle \{c\in C\mid \bigcup c\subseteq c\}} exists, whose union we call D .

Now D is a union of transitive sets, and therefore itself transitive. And since A ⊆ ⊆ D {\displaystyle A\subseteq D} , we know D ∪ ∪ { A } {\displaystyle D\cup \{A\}} is also transitive, and further contains A , as required. Q.E.D.

Metalogic [ edit ] The proof-theoretic ordinal of KPω is the Bachmann–Howard ordinal . KP fails to prove some common theorems in set theory, such as the Mostowski collapse lemma .
