Part of a series on Spaceflight History History of spaceflight Space Race Timeline of spaceflight Space probes Lunar missions Mars missions Applications Communications Earth observation Exploration Espionage Military Navigation Colonization Habitation Exploration Telescopes Tourism Spacecraft Robotic spacecraft Satellite Space probe Cargo spacecraft Crewed spacecraft Apollo Lunar Module Space capsules Space Shuttle Space stations Spaceplanes Vostok Space launch Spaceport Launch pad Expendable and reusable launch vehicles Escape velocity Non-rocket spacelaunch Spaceflight types Sub-orbital Orbital Interplanetary Interstellar Intergalactic List of space organizations Space agencies Space forces Companies Spaceflight portal v t e This is a list of space probes that have left Earth orbit (or were launched with that intention but failed), organized by their planned destination. It includes planetary probes, solar probes, and probes to asteroids and comets. Flybys (such as gravity assists ) that were incidental to the main purpose of the mission are also included.

Excluded are lunar missions, which are listed separately at List of lunar probes and List of Apollo missions . Flybys of Earth are listed separately at List of Earth flybys . Planned and proposed missions are in the List of proposed Solar System probes .

Key [ edit ] Colour key: – Mission or flyby completed successfully (or partially successfully) – Failed mission – Mission en route or in progress (including mission extensions) † means "tentatively identified", as classified by NASA.

[ 1 ] These are Cold War-era Soviet missions, mostly failures, about which few or no details have been officially released. The information given may be speculative.

Date is the date of: closest encounter (flybys) impact (impactors) orbital insertion to end of mission, whether planned or premature (orbiters) landing to end of mission, whether planned or premature (landers) launch (missions that never got underway due to failure at or soon after launch) In cases which do not fit any of the above, the event to which the date refers is stated. As a result of this scheme missions are not always listed in order of launch.

Some of the terms used under Type : Flyby: The probe flies by an astronomical body, but does not orbit it Orbiter : Part of a probe that orbits an astronomical body Lander : Part of a probe that descend to the surface of an astronomical body Rover : Part of a probe that acts as a vehicle to move on the solid-surface of an astronomical body Penetrator: Part of a probe that impacts an astronomical body Atmospheric probe or balloon: Part of a probe that descend through or floats in the atmosphere of an astronomical body; not restricted to weather balloons and other atmospheric sounders , as it can also be used for surface and subsurface imaging and remote sensing .

Sample return : Parts of the probe return to Earth with physical samples Under Status , in the case of flybys (such as gravity assists) that are incidental to the main mission, "success" indicates the successful completion of the flyby, not necessarily that of the main mission.

Solar probes [ edit ] Main articles: Heliophysics and Sun § Solar space missions While the Sun is not physically explorable with current technology, the following solar observation probes have been designed and launched to operate in heliocentric orbit or at one of the Earth–Sun Lagrangian points – additional solar observatories were placed in Earth orbit and are not included in this list: 1960–1969 [ edit ] Spacecraft Organization Date Type Status Notes Image Ref Pioneer 5 NASA / DOD March–April 1960 orbiter success measured magnetic field phenomena, solar flare particles, and ionization in the interplanetary region 1960-001A Pioneer 6(A) NASA December 1965 – still contactable in 2000 orbiter success network of solar-orbiting "space weather" monitors, observing solar wind, cosmic rays, and magnetic fields 1965-105A Pioneer 7(B) NASA August 1966 – still contactable in 1995 orbiter success 1966-075A Pioneer 8(C) NASA December 1967 – still contactable in 2001 orbiter success 1967-123A Pioneer 9(D) NASA November 1968 – May 1983 orbiter success 1968-100A Pioneer-E NASA 27 August 1969 orbiter failure intended as part of the Pioneer 6–9 network; failed to reach orbit PIONE 1974–1997 [ edit ] Spacecraft Organization Date Type Status Notes Image Ref Helios A DFVLR / NASA November 1974 – 1982 orbiter success observations of solar wind, magnetic and electric fields, cosmic rays and cosmic dust between Earth and Sun 1974-097A Helios B DFVLR / NASA January 1976 – 1985?
