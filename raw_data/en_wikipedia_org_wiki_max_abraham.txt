Biography [ edit ] Abraham was born in Danzig , Imperial Germany (now Gdańsk in Poland ) to a family of Jewish merchants . His father was Moritz Abraham and his mother was Selma Moritzsohn.  Attending the University of Berlin , he studied under Max Planck . He graduated in 1897. For the next three years, Abraham worked as Planck's assistant.

[ 1 ] From 1900 to 1909, Abraham worked at Göttingen as a privatdozent , an unpaid lecturing position. Abraham developed his theory of the electron in 1902, in which he hypothesized that the electron was a perfect sphere with a charge divided evenly around its surface. Abraham's model was competing with that developed by Hendrik Lorentz (1899, 1904) and Albert Einstein (1905) which seem to have become more widely accepted; nevertheless, Abraham never gave up his model, since he considered it was based on " common sense ". Abraham was a staunch opponent of the theory of relativity.

[ 2 ] In 1909 Abraham travelled to the United States to accept a position at the University of Illinois , but ended up returning to Göttingen after a few months. He was later invited to Italy by Tullio Levi-Civita , and found work as the professor of rational mechanics at the Politecnico di Milano university until 1914.

When World War I started, Abraham was forced to return to Germany. During this time he worked on the theory of radio transmission . After the war, he still was not allowed back into Milan, so until 1921 he worked at Stuttgart as the professor of physics at Technische Hochschule .

After his work at Stuttgart, Abraham accepted the position of chair in Aachen ; however, before he started his work there he was diagnosed with a brain tumor . He died on 16 November 1922 in Munich, Germany .

After his death, Max Born and Max von Laue wrote about him in an obituary: He loved his absolute aether , his field equations , his rigid electron just as a youth loves his first flame, whose memory no later experience can extinguish.
