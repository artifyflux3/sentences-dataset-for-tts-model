In arithmetic and algebra , the fourth power of a number n is the result of multiplying four instances of n together. So: n 4 = n × n × n × n Fourth powers are also formed by multiplying a number by its cube . Furthermore, they are squares of squares.

Some people refer to n 4 as n tesseracted , hypercubed , zenzizenzic , biquadrate or supercubed instead of “to the power of 4”.

The sequence of fourth powers of integers , known as biquadrates or tesseractic numbers , is: 0, 1, 16, 81, 256, 625, 1296, 2401, 4096, 6561, 10000, 14641, 20736, 28561, 38416, 50625, 65536, 83521, 104976, 130321, 160000, 194481, 234256, 279841, 331776, 390625, 456976, 531441, 614656, 707281, 810000, ... (sequence A000583 in the OEIS ).

Properties [ edit ] The last digit of a fourth power in decimal can only be 0, 1, 5, or 6.

In hexadecimal the last nonzero digit of a fourth power is always 1.

[ 1 ] Every positive integer can be expressed as the sum of at most 19 fourth powers; every integer larger than 13792 can be expressed as the sum of at most 16 fourth powers (see Waring's problem ).

Fermat knew that a fourth power cannot be the sum of two other fourth powers (the n = 4 case of Fermat's Last Theorem ; see Fermat's right triangle theorem ).

Euler conjectured that a fourth power cannot be written as the sum of three fourth powers, but 200 years later, in 1986,  this was disproven by Elkies with: 20615673 4 =  18796760 4 + 15365639 4 + 2682440 4 .

Elkies showed that there are infinitely many other counterexamples for exponent four, some of which are: [ 2 ] 2813001 4 = 2767624 4 + 1390400 4 + 673865 4 (Allan MacLeod) 8707481 4 = 8332208 4 + 5507880 4 + 1705575 4 (D.J. Bernstein) 12197457 4 = 11289040 4 + 8282543 4 + 5870000 4 (D.J. Bernstein) 16003017 4 = 14173720 4 + 12552200 4 + 4479031 4 (D.J. Bernstein) 16430513 4 = 16281009 4 + 7028600 4 + 3642840 4 (D.J. Bernstein) 422481 4 = 414560 4 + 217519 4 + 95800 4 (Roger Frye, 1988) 638523249 4 = 630662624 4 + 275156240 4 + 219076465 4 (Allan MacLeod, 1998) Equations containing a fourth power [ edit ] Fourth-degree equations , which contain a fourth degree (but no higher) polynomial are, by the Abel–Ruffini theorem , the highest degree equations having a general solution using radicals .

See also [ edit ] Square (algebra) Cube (algebra) Exponentiation Fifth power (algebra) Sixth power Seventh power Eighth power Perfect power References [ edit ] ^ An odd fourth power is the square of an odd square number. All odd squares are congruent to 1 modulo 8, and (8n+1) 2 = 64n 2 + 16n + 1 = 16(4n 2 + 1) + 1, meaning that all fourth powers are congruent to 1 modulo 16. Even fourth powers (excluding zero) are equal to (2 k n) 4 = 16 k n 4 for some positive integer k and odd integer n, meaning that an even fourth power can be represented as an odd fourth power multiplied by a power of 16.
