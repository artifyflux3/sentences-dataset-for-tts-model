Tarski's axiomatization, which is a second-order theory, can be seen as a version of the more usual definition of real numbers as the unique Dedekind-complete ordered field ; it is however made much more concise by avoiding multiplication altogether and using unorthodox variants of standard algebraic axioms and other subtle tricks. Tarski did not supply a proof that his axioms are sufficient or a definition for the multiplication of real numbers in his system.

Tarski also studied the first-order theory of the structure ( R , +, ·, <), leading to a set of axioms for this theory and to the concept of real closed fields .

The axioms [ edit ] Axioms of order (primitives: R, <) [ edit ] Axiom 1 If x < y , then not y < x .

[That is, "<" is an asymmetric relation . This implies that "<" is irreflexive , i.e., for all x , not x < x .] Axiom 2 If x < z , there exists a y such that x < y and y < z .

Axiom 3 For all subsets X , Y ⊆ R , if for all x ∈ X and y ∈ Y , x < y , then there exists a z such that for all x ∈ X and y ∈ Y , if x ≠ z and y ≠ z , then x < z and z < y .

[In other words, "<" is Dedekind-complete , or informally: "If a set of reals X precedes another set of reals Y , then there exists at least one real number z separating the two sets." This is a second-order axiom as it refers to sets and not just elements.] Axioms of addition (primitives: R, <, +) [ edit ] Axiom 4 x + ( y + z ) = ( x + z ) + y .

[Note that this is an unorthodox mixture of associativity and commutativity .] Axiom 5 For all x , y , there exists a z such that x + z = y .

[This allows subtraction and also gives a 0.] Axiom 6 If x + y < z + w , then x < z or y < w .

[This is the contrapositive of a standard axiom for ordered groups.] Axioms for 1 (primitives: R, <, +, 1) [ edit ] Axiom 7 1 ∈ R .

Axiom 8 1 < 1 + 1.

Discussion [ edit ] Tarski stated, without proof, that these axioms turn the relation < into a total ordering . The missing component was supplied in 2008 by Stefanie Ucsnay.

[ 2 ] The axioms then imply that R is a linearly ordered abelian group under addition with distinguished positive element 1 , and that this group is Dedekind-complete , divisible , and Archimedean .

Tarski never proved that these axioms and primitives imply the existence of a binary operation called multiplication that has the expected properties, so that R becomes a complete ordered field under addition and multiplication. It is possible to define this multiplication operation by considering certain order-preserving homomorphisms of the ordered group ( R ,+,<).
