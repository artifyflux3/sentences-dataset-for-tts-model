In [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics"), **equations of motion** are [equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation "Equation") that describe the behavior of a [physical system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_system "Physical system") in terms of its [motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics) "Motion (physics)") as a [function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics) "Function (mathematics)") of time.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_motion#cite_note-Physics_1991-1) More specifically, the equations of motion describe the behavior of a physical system as a set of mathematical functions in terms of dynamic variables. These variables are usually spatial coordinates and time, but may include [momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum "Momentum") components. The most general choice are [generalized coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_coordinates "Generalized coordinates") which can be any convenient variables characteristic of the physical system.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_motion#cite_note-Analytical_Mechanics_2008-2) The functions are defined in a [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space") in [classical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics "Classical mechanics"), but are replaced by [curved spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curved_space "Curved space") in [relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_relativity "Theory of relativity"). If the [dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamics_(mechanics) "Dynamics (mechanics)") of a system is known, the equations are the solutions for the [differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equations "Differential equations") describing the motion of the dynamics.

There are two main descriptions of motion: dynamics and [kinematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinematics "Kinematics"). Dynamics is general, since the momenta, [forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force "Force") and [energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy "Energy") of the [particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particles "Particles") are taken into account. In this instance, sometimes the term _dynamics_ refers to the differential equations that the system satisfies (e.g., [Newton's second law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_second_law "Newton's second law") or [Euler–Lagrange equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%E2%80%93Lagrange_equations "Euler–Lagrange equations")), and sometimes to the solutions to those equations.

However, kinematics is simpler. It concerns only variables derived from the positions of objects and time. In circumstances of constant acceleration, these simpler equations of motion are usually referred to as the [SUVAT equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_motion#Constant_translational_acceleration_in_a_straight_line), arising from the definitions of [kinematic quantities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinematic_quantity "Kinematic quantity"): displacement (_s_), initial velocity (_u_), final velocity (_v_), acceleration (_a_), and time (_t_).

A differential equation of motion, usually identified as some [physical law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_law "Physical law") (for example, F = ma), and applying definitions of [physical quantities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_quantities "Physical quantities"), is used to set up an equation to solve a kinematics problem. Solving the differential equation will lead to a general solution with arbitrary constants, the arbitrariness corresponding to a set of solutions. A particular solution can be obtained by setting the [initial values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_value_problem "Initial value problem"), which fixes the values of the constants.

Stated formally, in general, an equation of motion _M_ is a [function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics) "Function (mathematics)") of the [position](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position_(vector) "Position (vector)")**r** of the object, its [velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity "Velocity") (the first time [derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative "Derivative") of **r**, **v** = ⁠_d_**r**/_dt_⁠), and its acceleration (the second [derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative "Derivative") of **r**, **a** = ⁠_d_ 2**r**/_dt_ 2⁠), and time _t_. [Euclidean vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector "Euclidean vector") in 3D are denoted throughout in bold. This is equivalent to saying an equation of motion in **r** is a second-order [ordinary differential equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_differential_equation "Ordinary differential equation") (ODE) in **r**,

![Image 5: {\displaystyle M\left[\mathbf {r} (t),\mathbf {\dot {r}} (t),\mathbf {\ddot {r}} (t),t\right]=0\,,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/969c32e88d55826a347715bee49544f4ab6bf67a)

where _t_ is time, and each overdot denotes one [time derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_derivative "Time derivative"). The [initial conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_value_problem "Initial value problem") are given by the _constant_ values at _t_ = 0,

![Image 6: {\displaystyle \mathbf {r} (0)\,,\quad \mathbf {\dot {r}} (0)\,.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/30f67a03428ae17cc7974c0bd2a31619004635f9)

The solution **r**(_t_) to the equation of motion, with specified initial values, describes the system for all times _t_ after _t_ = 0. Other dynamical variables like the [momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum "Momentum")**p** of the object, or quantities derived from **r** and **p** like [angular momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_momentum "Angular momentum"), can be used in place of **r** as the quantity to solve for from some equation of motion, although the position of the object at time _t_ is by far the most sought-after quantity.

Sometimes, the equation will be [linear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_differential_equation "Linear differential equation") and is more likely to be exactly solvable. In general, the equation will be [non-linear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-linear_differential_equation "Non-linear differential equation"), and cannot be solved exactly so a variety of approximations must be used. The solutions to nonlinear equations may show [chaotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory "Chaos theory") behavior depending on how _sensitive_ the system is to the initial conditions.

Kinematics, dynamics and the mathematical models of the universe developed incrementally over three millennia, thanks to many thinkers, only some of whose names we know. In antiquity, [priests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priest "Priest"), [astrologers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrology "Astrology") and [astronomers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomer "Astronomer") predicted solar and lunar [eclipses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipses "Eclipses"), the solstices and the equinoxes of the [Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun "Sun") and the period of the [Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon "Moon"). But they had nothing other than a set of algorithms to guide them. Equations of motion were not written down for another thousand years.

Medieval scholars in the thirteenth century — for example at the relatively new universities in Oxford and Paris — drew on ancient mathematicians (Euclid and Archimedes) and philosophers (Aristotle) to develop a new body of knowledge, now called physics.

At Oxford, [Merton College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merton_College "Merton College") sheltered a group of scholars devoted to natural science, mainly physics, astronomy and mathematics, who were of similar stature to the intellectuals at the University of Paris. [Thomas Bradwardine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Bradwardine#Science "Thomas Bradwardine") extended Aristotelian quantities such as distance and velocity, and assigned intensity and extension to them. Bradwardine suggested an exponential law involving force, resistance, distance, velocity and time. [Nicholas Oresme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicole_Oresme "Nicole Oresme") further extended Bradwardine's arguments. The [Merton school](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_Calculators "Oxford Calculators") proved that the quantity of motion of a body undergoing a uniformly accelerated motion is equal to the quantity of a uniform motion at the speed achieved halfway through the accelerated motion.

For writers on kinematics before [Galileo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo "Galileo"), since small time intervals could not be measured, the affinity between time and motion was obscure. They used time as a function of distance, and in free fall, greater velocity as a result of greater elevation. Only [Domingo de Soto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domingo_de_Soto "Domingo de Soto"), a Spanish theologian, in his commentary on [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle "Aristotle")'s _[Physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics\_(Aristotle) "Physics (Aristotle)")_ published in 1545, after defining "uniform difform" motion (which is uniformly accelerated motion) – the word velocity was not used – as proportional to time, declared correctly that this kind of motion was identifiable with freely falling bodies and projectiles, without his proving these propositions or suggesting a formula relating time, velocity and distance. De Soto's comments are remarkably correct regarding the definitions of acceleration (acceleration was a rate of change of motion (velocity) in time) and the observation that acceleration would be negative during ascent.

Discourses such as these spread throughout Europe, shaping the work of [Galileo Galilei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei "Galileo Galilei") and others, and helped in laying the foundation of kinematics.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_motion#cite_note-book-3) Galileo deduced the equation _s_ = ⁠1/2⁠_gt_ 2 in his work geometrically,[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_motion#cite_note-4) using the [Merton rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_speed_theorem "Mean speed theorem"), now known as a special case of one of the equations of kinematics.

Galileo was the first to show that the path of a projectile is a [parabola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabola "Parabola"). Galileo had an understanding of [centrifugal force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrifugal_force "Centrifugal force") and gave a correct definition of [momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum "Momentum"). This emphasis of momentum as a fundamental quantity in dynamics is of prime importance. He measured momentum by the product of velocity and weight; mass is a later concept, developed by Huygens and Newton. In the swinging of a simple pendulum, Galileo says in _[Discourses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two\_New\_Sciences "Two New Sciences")_[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_motion#cite_note-5) that "every momentum acquired in the descent along an arc is equal to that which causes the same moving body to ascend through the same arc." His analysis on projectiles indicates that Galileo had grasped the first law and the second law of motion. He did not generalize and make them applicable to bodies not subject to the earth's gravitation. That step was Newton's contribution.

The term "inertia" was used by Kepler who applied it to bodies at rest. (The first law of motion is now often called the law of inertia.)

Galileo did not fully grasp the third law of motion, the law of the equality of action and reaction, though he corrected some errors of Aristotle. With [Stevin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Stevin "Simon Stevin") and others Galileo also wrote on statics. He formulated the principle of the parallelogram of forces, but he did not fully recognize its scope.

Galileo also was interested by the laws of the pendulum, his first observations of which were as a young man. In 1583, while he was praying in the cathedral at Pisa, his attention was arrested by the motion of the great lamp lighted and left swinging, referencing his own pulse for time keeping. To him the period appeared the same, even after the motion had greatly diminished, discovering the isochronism of the pendulum.

More careful experiments carried out by him later, and described in his Discourses, revealed the period of oscillation varies with the square root of length but is independent of the mass the pendulum.

Thus we arrive at [René Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes "René Descartes"), [Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton"), [Gottfried Leibniz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Leibniz "Gottfried Leibniz"), et al.; and the evolved forms of the equations of motion that begin to be recognized as the modern ones.

Later the equations of motion also appeared in [electrodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrodynamics "Electrodynamics"), when describing the motion of charged particles in electric and magnetic fields, the [Lorentz force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_force "Lorentz force") is the general equation which serves as the definition of what is meant by an [electric field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_field "Electric field") and [magnetic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field "Magnetic field"). With the advent of [special relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity "Special relativity") and [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity"), the theoretical modifications to [spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime "Spacetime") meant the classical equations of motion were also modified to account for the finite [speed of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light "Speed of light"), and [curvature of spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvature_of_spacetime "Curvature of spacetime"). In all these cases the differential equations were in terms of a function describing the particle's trajectory in terms of space and time coordinates, as influenced by forces or energy transformations.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_motion#cite_note-Halliday2004-6)

However, the equations of [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics") can also be considered "equations of motion", since they are differential equations of the [wavefunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefunction "Wavefunction"), which describes how a quantum state behaves analogously using the space and time coordinates of the particles. There are analogs of equations of motion in other areas of physics, for collections of physical phenomena that can be considered waves, fluids, or fields.

Kinematic equations for one particle
------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Equations_of_motion&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Kinematic equations for one particle")]

### Kinematic quantities

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Equations_of_motion&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Kinematic quantities")]

[![Image 7](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Kinematics.svg/330px-Kinematics.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Kinematics.svg)

Kinematic quantities of a classical particle of mass _m_: position **r**, velocity **v**, acceleration **a**.

From the [instantaneous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instantaneous "Instantaneous") position **r** = **r**(_t_), instantaneous meaning at an instant value of time _t_, the instantaneous velocity **v** = **v**(_t_) and acceleration **a** = **a**(_t_) have the general, coordinate-independent definitions;[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_motion#cite_note-Relativity-7)

![Image 8: {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} ={\frac {d\mathbf {r} }{dt}}\,,\quad \mathbf {a} ={\frac {d\mathbf {v} }{dt}}={\frac {d^{2}\mathbf {r} }{dt^{2}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/eae736781484f25638714f09288eebaf6bb02ec6)

Notice that velocity always points in the direction of motion, in other words for a curved path it is the [tangent vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_vector "Tangent vector"). Loosely speaking, first order derivatives are related to tangents of curves. Still for curved paths, the acceleration is directed towards the [center of curvature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_curvature "Center of curvature") of the path. Again, loosely speaking, second order derivatives are related to curvature.

The rotational analogues are the "angular vector" (angle the particle rotates about some axis) **θ** = **θ**(_t_), angular velocity **ω** = **ω**(_t_), and angular acceleration **α** = **α**(_t_):

[![Image 9: {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\theta }}=\theta {\hat {\mathbf {n} }}\,,\quad {\boldsymbol {\omega }}={\frac {d{\boldsymbol {\theta }}}{dt}}\,,\quad {\boldsymbol {\alpha }}={\frac {d{\boldsymbol {\omega }}}{dt}}\,,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/65f29a10a1c8c32e70261c0a01a797dcfa8cfd39)](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:MathWikibase&qid=Q107617)

where **n̂** is a [unit vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_vector "Unit vector") in the direction of the axis of rotation, and _θ_ is the angle the object turns through about the axis.

The following relation holds for a point-like particle, orbiting about some axis with angular velocity **ω**:[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_motion#cite_note-8)

[![Image 10: {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} ={\boldsymbol {\omega }}\times \mathbf {r} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/73cbd54f9e6b846701d83f12d500a98204999f10)](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:MathWikibase&qid=Q11465)

where **r** is the position vector of the particle (radial from the rotation axis) and **v** the tangential velocity of the particle. For a rotating continuum [rigid body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigid_body "Rigid body"), these relations hold for each point in the rigid body.

### Uniform acceleration

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Equations_of_motion&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Uniform acceleration")]

The differential equation of motion for a particle of constant or uniform acceleration in a straight line is simple: the acceleration is constant, so the second derivative of the position of the object is constant. The results of this case are summarized below.

#### Constant translational acceleration in a straight line

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Equations_of_motion&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Constant translational acceleration in a straight line")]

These equations apply to a particle moving linearly, in three dimensions in a straight line with constant [acceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration "Acceleration").[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_motion#cite_note-Physics_P.M-9) Since the position, velocity, and acceleration are collinear (parallel, and lie on the same line) – only the magnitudes of these vectors are necessary, and because the motion is along a straight line, the problem effectively reduces from three dimensions to one.

![Image 11: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}v&=v_{0}+at&[1]\\r&=r_{0}+v_{0}t+{\tfrac {1}{2}}{a}t^{2}&[2]\\r&=r_{0}+{\tfrac {1}{2}}\left(v+v_{0}\right)t&[3]\\v^{2}&=v_{0}^{2}+2a\left(r-r_{0}\right)&[4]\\r&=r_{0}+vt-{\tfrac {1}{2}}{a}t^{2}&[5]\\\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/988f69a1a243b4abf8b23f1c9e7339976a625266)

where:

*   _r_ 0 is the particle's initial [position](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position_(vector) "Position (vector)")
*   _r_ is the particle's final position
*   _v_ 0 is the particle's initial [velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity "Velocity")
*   _v_ is the particle's final velocity
*   _a_ is the particle's [acceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration "Acceleration")
*   _t_ is the [time interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_physics "Time in physics")

Here _a_ is _constant_ acceleration, or in the case of bodies moving under the influence of [gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity "Gravity"), the [standard gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_gravity "Standard gravity")_g_ is used. Note that each of the equations contains four of the five variables, so in this situation it is sufficient to know three out of the five variables to calculate the remaining two.

In some programs, such as the [IGCSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_General_Certificate_of_Secondary_Education "International General Certificate of Secondary Education") Physics and [IB DP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IB_Diploma_Programme "IB Diploma Programme")[Physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IB_Group_4_subjects "IB Group 4 subjects") programs (international programs but especially popular in the UK and Europe), the same formulae would be written with a different set of preferred variables. There _u_ replaces _v_ 0 and _s_ replaces _r_ - _r_ 0. They are often referred to as the **SUVAT equations**, where "SUVAT" is an [acronym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acronym "Acronym") from the variables: _s_ = displacement, _u_ = initial velocity, _v_ = final velocity, _a_ = acceleration, _t_ = time.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_motion#cite_note-Hanrahan2003-10)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_motion#cite_note-11) In these variables, the equations of motion would be written

![Image 12: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}v&=u+at&[1]\\s&=ut+{\tfrac {1}{2}}at^{2}&[2]\\s&={\tfrac {1}{2}}(u+v)t&[3]\\v^{2}&=u^{2}+2as&[4]\\s&=vt-{\tfrac {1}{2}}at^{2}&[5]\\\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1246ab112ef8137bfed9cffd49530fa032bb9f09)

#### Constant linear acceleration in any direction

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Equations_of_motion&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Constant linear acceleration in any direction")]

[![Image 13](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Suvat_eom_any_direction_constant_acceleration.svg/500px-Suvat_eom_any_direction_constant_acceleration.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Suvat_eom_any_direction_constant_acceleration.svg)

Trajectory of a particle with initial position vector **r**0 and velocity **v**0, subject to constant acceleration **a**, all three quantities in any direction, and the position **r**(_t_) and velocity **v**(_t_) after time _t_.

The initial position, initial velocity, and acceleration vectors need not be collinear, and the equations of motion take an almost identical form. The only difference is that the square magnitudes of the velocities require the [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product "Dot product"). The derivations are essentially the same as in the collinear case,

![Image 14: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\mathbf {v} &=\mathbf {a} t+\mathbf {v} _{0}&[1]\\\mathbf {r} &=\mathbf {r} _{0}+\mathbf {v} _{0}t+{\tfrac {1}{2}}\mathbf {a} t^{2}&[2]\\\mathbf {r} &=\mathbf {r} _{0}+{\tfrac {1}{2}}\left(\mathbf {v} +\mathbf {v} _{0}\right)t&[3]\\\mathbf {v} ^{2}&=\mathbf {v} _{0}^{2}+2\mathbf {a} \cdot \left(\mathbf {r} -\mathbf {r} _{0}\right)&[4]\\\mathbf {r} &=\mathbf {r} _{0}+\mathbf {v} t-{\tfrac {1}{2}}\mathbf {a} t^{2}&[5]\\\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c757b958c1607b01cc40d06258309a93783ace8f) although the [Torricelli equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torricelli_equation "Torricelli equation") [4] can be derived using the [distributive property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributive_property "Distributive property") of the dot product as follows: ![Image 15: {\displaystyle v^{2}=\mathbf {v} \cdot \mathbf {v} =(\mathbf {v} _{0}+\mathbf {a} t)\cdot (\mathbf {v} _{0}+\mathbf {a} t)=v_{0}^{2}+2t(\mathbf {a} \cdot \mathbf {v} _{0})+a^{2}t^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/66ed09917363013c2ae3aa1d6898c489a3280bee)![Image 16: {\displaystyle (2\mathbf {a} )\cdot (\mathbf {r} -\mathbf {r} _{0})=(2\mathbf {a} )\cdot \left(\mathbf {v} _{0}t+{\tfrac {1}{2}}\mathbf {a} t^{2}\right)=2t(\mathbf {a} \cdot \mathbf {v} _{0})+a^{2}t^{2}=v^{2}-v_{0}^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/30bc65adde716d0ed34cf90fb80f88bd3965e920)![Image 17: {\displaystyle \therefore v^{2}=v_{0}^{2}+2(\mathbf {a} \cdot (\mathbf {r} -\mathbf {r} _{0}))}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e3973ccac3423f889c90413b5e3a040361636d20)

Elementary and frequent examples in kinematics involve [projectiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projectile "Projectile"), for example a ball thrown upwards into the air. Given initial velocity _u_, one can calculate how high the ball will travel before it begins to fall. The acceleration is local acceleration of gravity _g_. While these quantities appear to be [scalars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_(physics) "Scalar (physics)"), the direction of displacement, speed and acceleration is important. They could in fact be considered as unidirectional vectors. Choosing _s_ to measure up from the ground, the acceleration _a_ must be in fact _−g_, since the force of [gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity "Gravity") acts downwards and therefore also the acceleration on the ball due to it.

At the highest point, the ball will be at rest: therefore _v_ = 0. Using equation [4] in the set above, we have:

![Image 18: {\displaystyle s={\frac {v^{2}-u^{2}}{-2g}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e75248709be7324af38ad68fd15e6a2a01f44185)

Substituting and cancelling minus signs gives:

![Image 19: {\displaystyle s={\frac {u^{2}}{2g}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5c6668a18959a94c2b45b2dad4ad9d966574bd0e)

#### Constant circular acceleration

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Equations_of_motion&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Constant circular acceleration")]

The analogues of the above equations can be written for [rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation "Rotation"). Again these axial vectors must all be parallel to the axis of rotation, so only the magnitudes of the vectors are necessary,

![Image 20: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\omega &=\omega _{0}+\alpha t\\\theta &=\theta _{0}+\omega _{0}t+{\tfrac {1}{2}}\alpha t^{2}\\\theta &=\theta _{0}+{\tfrac {1}{2}}(\omega _{0}+\omega )t\\\omega ^{2}&=\omega _{0}^{2}+2\alpha (\theta -\theta _{0})\\\theta &=\theta _{0}+\omega t-{\tfrac {1}{2}}\alpha t^{2}\\\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f0fbdf3867e338ce56138703c88a9877c62e31c2)

where _α_ is the constant [angular acceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_acceleration "Angular acceleration"), _ω_ is the [angular velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_velocity "Angular velocity"), _ω_ 0 is the initial angular velocity, _θ_ is the angle turned through ([angular displacement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_displacement "Angular displacement")), _θ_ 0 is the initial angle, and _t_ is the time taken to rotate from the initial state to the final state.

### General planar motion

Position vector **r**, always points radially from the origin.

[![Image 22](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Velocity_vector_plane_polar_coords.svg/250px-Velocity_vector_plane_polar_coords.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Velocity_vector_plane_polar_coords.svg)

Velocity vector **v**, always tangent to the path of motion.

[![Image 23](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/Acceleration_vector_plane_polar_coords.svg/250px-Acceleration_vector_plane_polar_coords.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Acceleration_vector_plane_polar_coords.svg)

Acceleration vector **a**, not parallel to the radial motion but offset by the angular and Coriolis accelerations, nor tangent to the path but offset by the centripetal and radial accelerations.

Kinematic vectors in plane polar coordinates. Notice the setup is not restricted to 2D space, but a plane in any higher dimension.

These are the kinematic equations for a particle traversing a path in a plane, described by position **r** = **r**(_t_).[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_motion#cite_note-12) They are simply the time derivatives of the position vector in plane [polar coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_coordinates "Polar coordinates") using the definitions of physical quantities above for angular velocity _ω_ and angular acceleration _α_. These are instantaneous quantities which change with time.

The position of the particle is

![Image 24: {\displaystyle \mathbf {r} =\mathbf {r} \left(r(t),\theta (t)\right)=r\mathbf {\hat {e}} _{r}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ca5eb1998d2a457a860daeafba0fb989ec0fa12e)

where **ê**_r_ and **ê**_θ_ are the [polar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_coordinate_system#Vector_calculus "Polar coordinate system") unit vectors. Differentiating with respect to time gives the velocity

![Image 25: {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} =\mathbf {\hat {e}} _{r}{\frac {dr}{dt}}+r\omega \mathbf {\hat {e}} _{\theta }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/58a65e1825c17315b2911025d51b419d6086c60d)

with radial component ⁠_dr_/_dt_⁠ and an additional component _rω_ due to the rotation. Differentiating with respect to time again obtains the acceleration

![Image 26: {\displaystyle \mathbf {a} =\left({\frac {d^{2}r}{dt^{2}}}-r\omega ^{2}\right)\mathbf {\hat {e}} _{r}+\left(r\alpha +2\omega {\frac {dr}{dt}}\right)\mathbf {\hat {e}} _{\theta }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/14021f78d63e4a2d797cd03b7b704450afb59407)

which breaks into the radial acceleration ⁠_d_ 2 _r_/_dt_ 2⁠, [centripetal acceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centripetal_acceleration "Centripetal acceleration")–_rω_ 2, [Coriolis acceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coriolis_acceleration "Coriolis acceleration")2 _ω_⁠_dr_/_dt_⁠, and angular acceleration _rα_.

Special cases of motion described by these equations are summarized qualitatively in the table below. Two have already been discussed above, in the cases that either the radial components or the angular components are zero, and the non-zero component of motion describes uniform acceleration.

| **State of motion** | Constant _r_ | _r_ linear in _t_ | _r_ quadratic in _t_ | _r_ non-linear in _t_ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Constant _θ_ | Stationary | Uniform translation (constant translational velocity) | Uniform translational acceleration | Non-uniform translation |
| _θ_ linear in _t_ | Uniform angular motion in a circle (constant angular velocity) | Uniform angular motion in a spiral, constant radial velocity | Angular motion in a spiral, constant radial acceleration | Angular motion in a spiral, varying radial acceleration |
| _θ_ quadratic in _t_ | Uniform angular acceleration in a circle | Uniform angular acceleration in a spiral, constant radial velocity | Uniform angular acceleration in a spiral, constant radial acceleration | Uniform angular acceleration in a spiral, varying radial acceleration |
| _θ_ non-linear in _t_ | Non-uniform angular acceleration in a circle | Non-uniform angular acceleration in a spiral, constant radial velocity | Non-uniform angular acceleration in a spiral, constant radial acceleration | Non-uniform angular acceleration in a spiral, varying radial acceleration |

In 3D space, the equations in spherical coordinates (_r_, _θ_, _φ_) with corresponding unit vectors **ê**_r_, **ê**_θ_ and **ê**_φ_, the position, velocity, and acceleration generalize respectively to

![Image 27: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\mathbf {r} &=\mathbf {r} \left(t\right)=r\mathbf {\hat {e}} _{r}\\\mathbf {v} &=v\mathbf {\hat {e}} _{r}+r\,{\frac {d\theta }{dt}}\mathbf {\hat {e}} _{\theta }+r\,{\frac {d\varphi }{dt}}\,\sin \theta \mathbf {\hat {e}} _{\varphi }\\\mathbf {a} &=\left(a-r\left({\frac {d\theta }{dt}}\right)^{2}-r\left({\frac {d\varphi }{dt}}\right)^{2}\sin ^{2}\theta \right)\mathbf {\hat {e}} _{r}\\&+\left(r{\frac {d^{2}\theta }{dt^{2}}}+2v{\frac {d\theta }{dt}}-r\left({\frac {d\varphi }{dt}}\right)^{2}\sin \theta \cos \theta \right)\mathbf {\hat {e}} _{\theta }\\&+\left(r{\frac {d^{2}\varphi }{dt^{2}}}\,\sin \theta +2v\,{\frac {d\varphi }{dt}}\,\sin \theta +2r\,{\frac {d\theta }{dt}}\,{\frac {d\varphi }{dt}}\,\cos \theta \right)\mathbf {\hat {e}} _{\varphi }\end{aligned}}\,\!}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1918de095b80ec9e8e43e002fa5ab9e5c6101a62)

In the case of a constant _φ_ this reduces to the planar equations above.

Dynamic equations of motion
---------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Equations_of_motion&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Dynamic equations of motion")]

### Newtonian mechanics

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Equations_of_motion&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Newtonian mechanics")]

The first general equation of motion developed was [Newton's second law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_second_law "Newton's second law") of motion. In its most general form it states the rate of change of momentum **p** = **p**(_t_) = _m_**v**(_t_) of an object equals the force **F** = **F**(**x**(_t_), **v**(_t_), _t_) acting on it,[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_motion#cite_note-Mechanics,_D._Kleppner_2010-13): 1112

[![Image 28: {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} ={\frac {d\mathbf {p} }{dt}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f41262ddf9006958a428ef004518427e53d7b912)](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:MathWikibase&qid=Q2397319)

The force in the equation is _not_ the force the object exerts. Replacing momentum by mass times velocity, the law is also written more famously as

![Image 29: {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} =m\mathbf {a} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d0c60fab89e8c3193952047dc565bcf8d233d115)

since _m_ is a constant in [Newtonian mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newtonian_mechanics "Newtonian mechanics").

Newton's second law applies to point-like particles, and to all points in a [rigid body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigid_body "Rigid body"). They also apply to each point in a mass continuum, like deformable solids or fluids, but the motion of the system must be accounted for; see [material derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_derivative "Material derivative"). In the case the mass is not constant, it is not sufficient to use the [product rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_rule "Product rule") for the time derivative on the mass and velocity, and Newton's second law requires some modification consistent with [conservation of momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_of_momentum "Conservation of momentum"); see [variable-mass system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable-mass_system "Variable-mass system").

It may be simple to write down the equations of motion in vector form using Newton's laws of motion, but the components may vary in complicated ways with spatial coordinates and time, and solving them is not easy. Often there is an excess of variables to solve for the problem completely, so Newton's laws are not always the most efficient way to determine the motion of a system. In simple cases of rectangular geometry, Newton's laws work fine in Cartesian coordinates, but in other coordinate systems can become dramatically complex.

The momentum form is preferable since this is readily generalized to more complex systems, such as [special](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity "Special relativity") and [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity") (see [four-momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-momentum "Four-momentum")).[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_motion#cite_note-Mechanics,_D._Kleppner_2010-13): 112  It can also be used with the momentum conservation. However, Newton's laws are not more fundamental than momentum conservation, because Newton's laws are merely consistent with the fact that zero resultant force acting on an object implies constant momentum, while a resultant force implies the momentum is not constant. Momentum conservation is always true for an isolated system not subject to resultant forces.

For a number of particles (see [many body problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many_body_problem "Many body problem")), the equation of motion for one particle _i_ influenced by other particles is[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_motion#cite_note-Relativity-7)[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_motion#cite_note-Physics_1991-1)![Image 30: {\displaystyle {\frac {d\mathbf {p} _{i}}{dt}}=\mathbf {F} _{E}+\sum _{i\neq j}\mathbf {F} _{ij}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d14fde75a7a3ff40f44b097784c7a82c9cd70a48)

where **p**_i_ is the momentum of particle _i_, **F**_ij_ is the force on particle _i_ by particle _j_, and **F**_E_ is the resultant external force due to any agent not part of system. Particle _i_ does not exert a force on itself.

[Euler's laws of motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_laws_of_motion "Euler's laws of motion") are similar to Newton's laws, but they are applied specifically to the motion of [rigid bodies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigid_body "Rigid body"). The [Newton–Euler equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Euler_equations "Newton–Euler equations") combine the forces and torques acting on a rigid body into a single equation.

Newton's second law for rotation takes a similar form to the translational case,[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_motion#cite_note-Mechanics,_D._Kleppner_2010-13)

![Image 31: {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\tau }}={\frac {d\mathbf {L} }{dt}}\,,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/44ceccc0d28e9a72f7cdf92af6578da6e2bf7fa6)

by equating the [torque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque "Torque") acting on the body to the rate of change of its [angular momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_momentum "Angular momentum")**L**. Analogous to mass times acceleration, the [moment of inertia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_of_inertia "Moment of inertia")[tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor "Tensor")**I** depends on the distribution of mass about the axis of rotation, and the angular acceleration is the rate of change of angular velocity,

![Image 32: {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\tau }}=\mathbf {I} {\boldsymbol {\alpha }}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4ef05c6d096e4a63943db87855e8e4a7d083a44d)

Again, these equations apply to point like particles, or at each point of a rigid body.

Likewise, for a number of particles, the equation of motion for one particle _i_ is[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_motion#cite_note-Relativity-7)

![Image 33: {\displaystyle {\frac {d\mathbf {L} _{i}}{dt}}={\boldsymbol {\tau }}_{E}+\sum _{i\neq j}{\boldsymbol {\tau }}_{ij}\,,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fd5b2578bde3cfb814da84d81153a84997145715)

where **L**_i_ is the angular momentum of particle _i_, **τ**_ij_ the torque on particle _i_ by particle _j_, and **τ**_E_ is resultant external torque (due to any agent not part of system). Particle _i_ does not exert a torque on itself.

Some examples[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_motion#cite_note-Waves_1983-14) of Newton's law include describing the motion of a [simple pendulum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_pendulum "Simple pendulum"),

![Image 34: {\displaystyle -mg\sin \theta =m{\frac {d^{2}(\ell \theta )}{dt^{2}}}\quad \Rightarrow \quad {\frac {d^{2}\theta }{dt^{2}}}=-{\frac {g}{\ell }}\sin \theta \,,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b819ff8d4fed7302c9b67f624e72f5d0eabcbf93)

and a [damped, sinusoidally driven harmonic oscillator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_oscillator#Sinusoidal_driving_force "Harmonic oscillator"),

![Image 35: {\displaystyle F_{0}\sin(\omega t)=m\left({\frac {d^{2}x}{dt^{2}}}+2\zeta \omega _{0}{\frac {dx}{dt}}+\omega _{0}^{2}x\right)\,.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2b0827bbd1669dd97511f12ddd8aef6a1dbe4cee)

For describing the motion of masses due to gravity, [Newton's law of gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_gravity "Newton's law of gravity") can be combined with Newton's second law. For two examples, a ball of mass m thrown in the air, in air currents (such as wind) described by a vector field of resistive forces **R** = **R**(**r**, _t_),

![Image 36: {\displaystyle -{\frac {GmM}{|\mathbf {r} |^{2}}}\mathbf {\hat {e}} _{r}+\mathbf {R} =m{\frac {d^{2}\mathbf {r} }{dt^{2}}}+0\quad \Rightarrow \quad {\frac {d^{2}\mathbf {r} }{dt^{2}}}=-{\frac {GM}{|\mathbf {r} |^{2}}}\mathbf {\hat {e}} _{r}+\mathbf {A} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/929db450272605c0b62e23676847f76954e4f644)

where _G_ is the [gravitational constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_constant "Gravitational constant"), _M_ the mass of the Earth, and **A** = ⁠**R**/_m_⁠ is the acceleration of the projectile due to the air currents at position **r** and time t.

The classical [N-body problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many_body_problem "Many body problem") for N particles each interacting with each other due to gravity is a set of N nonlinear coupled second order ODEs,

![Image 37: {\displaystyle {\frac {d^{2}\mathbf {r} _{i}}{dt^{2}}}=G\sum _{i\neq j}{\frac {m_{j}}{|\mathbf {r} _{j}-\mathbf {r} _{i}|^{3}}}(\mathbf {r} _{j}-\mathbf {r} _{i})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/be8ebb22e8b308db567b4c9e73f3041c5d5de818)

where _i_ = 1, 2, ..., _N_ labels the quantities (mass, position, etc.) associated with each particle.

As the system evolves, **q** traces a path through [configuration space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Configuration_space_(physics) "Configuration space (physics)") (only some are shown). The path taken by the system (red) has a stationary action (_δS_ = 0) under small changes in the configuration of the system (_δ_**q**).[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_motion#cite_note-15)

Using all three coordinates of 3D space is unnecessary if there are constraints on the system. If the system has _N_[degrees of freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrees_of_freedom_(mechanics) "Degrees of freedom (mechanics)"), then one can use a set of _N_[generalized coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_coordinates "Generalized coordinates")**q**(_t_) = [_q_ 1(_t_), _q_ 2(_t_) ... _q N_(_t_)], to define the configuration of the system. They can be in the form of [arc lengths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc_length "Arc length") or [angles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle "Angle"). They are a considerable simplification to describe motion, since they take advantage of the intrinsic constraints that limit the system's motion, and the number of coordinates is reduced to a minimum. The [time derivatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_derivative "Time derivative") of the generalized coordinates are the _generalized velocities_

![Image 39: {\displaystyle \mathbf {\dot {q}} ={\frac {d\mathbf {q} }{dt}}\,.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8966bd8ea91d44376487b22da9170bcef666ee0d)

The action _S_ allows identification of conserved quantities for mechanical systems, even when the mechanical problem itself cannot be solved fully, because any [differentiable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative "Derivative")[symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry_in_physics "Symmetry in physics") of the [action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_(physics) "Action (physics)") of a physical system has a corresponding [conservation law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_law_(physics) "Conservation law (physics)"), a theorem due to [Emmy Noether](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Noether "Emmy Noether").

Combining with Newton's second law gives a first order differential equation of motion, in terms of position of the particle:

![Image 51: {\displaystyle m{\frac {d^{2}\mathbf {r} }{dt^{2}}}=q\left(\mathbf {E} +{\frac {d\mathbf {r} }{dt}}\times \mathbf {B} \right)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/67236eabface67f455f0c136d89b1cb2e5e10106)

or its momentum:

The same equation can be obtained using the [Lagrangian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_mechanics "Lagrangian mechanics") (and applying Lagrange's equations above) for a charged particle of mass _m_ and charge _q_:[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_motion#cite_note-Classical_Mechanics_1973-16)

![Image 53: {\displaystyle L={\tfrac {1}{2}}m\mathbf {\dot {r}} \cdot \mathbf {\dot {r}} +q\mathbf {A} \cdot {\dot {\mathbf {r} }}-q\phi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/066808135c69b860292e150d0d770b4ebf73d72d)

where **A** and _ϕ_ are the electromagnetic [scalar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_potential "Electrical potential") and [vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_vector_potential "Magnetic vector potential") potential fields. The Lagrangian indicates an additional detail: the [canonical momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_momentum "Canonical momentum") in Lagrangian mechanics is given by: ![Image 54: {\displaystyle \mathbf {P} ={\frac {\partial L}{\partial {\dot {\mathbf {r} }}}}=m{\dot {\mathbf {r} }}+q\mathbf {A} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9a01904ef0fbdd3aee925656403b2c571fccc464) instead of just _m_**v**, implying the motion of a charged particle is fundamentally determined by the mass and charge of the particle. The Lagrangian expression was first used to derive the force equation.

Alternatively the Hamiltonian (and substituting into the equations):[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_motion#cite_note-Classical_Mechanics_1973-16)![Image 55: {\displaystyle H={\frac {\left(\mathbf {P} -q\mathbf {A} \right)^{2}}{2m}}+q\phi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/16cdc9d5c5b96fc2a0200f76f0cd79ab4158d14d) can derive the Lorentz force equation.

### Geodesic equation of motion

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Equations_of_motion&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Geodesic equation of motion")]

[![Image 56](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Geodesic_deviation_on_a_sphere.svg/200px-Geodesic_deviation_on_a_sphere.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Geodesic_deviation_on_a_sphere.svg)

Geodesics on a [sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere "Sphere") are arcs of [great circles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_circle "Great circle") (yellow curve). On a [2D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(mathematics) "Plane (mathematics)")–[manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold "Manifold") (such as the sphere shown), the direction of the accelerating geodesic is uniquely fixed if the separation vector **ξ** is [orthogonal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal "Orthogonal") to the "fiducial geodesic" (green curve). As the separation vector **ξ**0 changes to **ξ** after a distance _s_, the geodesics are not parallel (geodesic deviation).[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_motion#cite_note-Gravitation-18)

The above equations are valid in flat spacetime. In [curved](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curved_space "Curved space")[spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime "Spacetime"), things become mathematically more complicated since there is no straight line; this is generalized and replaced by a _[geodesic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic "Geodesic")_ of the curved spacetime (the shortest length of curve between two points). For curved [manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold "Manifold") with a [metric tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_tensor "Metric tensor")_g_, the metric provides the notion of arc length (see [line element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_element "Line element") for details). The [differential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_(infinitesimal) "Differential (infinitesimal)") arc length is given by:[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_motion#cite_note-ParkerEncycl-19): [1199](https://archive.org/details/mcgrawhillencycl1993park/page/1199)

[![Image 57: {\displaystyle ds={\sqrt {g_{\alpha \beta }dx^{\alpha }dx^{\beta }}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4d586a45bfdfa6c22d1825df0c6be4eb85f383b3)](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:MathWikibase&qid=Q1228250)

and the geodesic equation is a second-order differential equation in the coordinates. The general solution is a family of geodesics:[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_motion#cite_note-ParkerEncycl-19): [1200](https://archive.org/details/mcgrawhillencycl1993park/page/1200)

![Image 58: {\displaystyle {\frac {d^{2}x^{\mu }}{ds^{2}}}=-\Gamma ^{\mu }{}_{\alpha \beta }{\frac {dx^{\alpha }}{ds}}{\frac {dx^{\beta }}{ds}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4a57a4520d040276d56b096d122af89a77bdb8fd)

where _Γ μ αβ_ is a [Christoffel symbol of the second kind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christoffel_symbols#Christoffel_symbols_of_the_second_kind_(symmetric_definition) "Christoffel symbols"), which contains the metric (with respect to the coordinate system).

Given the [mass-energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass-energy_equivalence "Mass-energy equivalence") distribution provided by the [stress–energy tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress%E2%80%93energy_tensor "Stress–energy tensor")_T αβ_, the [Einstein field equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_field_equations "Einstein field equations") are a set of non-linear second-order partial differential equations in the metric, and imply the curvature of spacetime is equivalent to a gravitational field (see [equivalence principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_principle "Equivalence principle")). Mass falling in curved spacetime is equivalent to a mass falling in a gravitational field - because [gravity is a fictitious force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictitious_force#Gravity_as_a_fictitious_force "Fictitious force"). The _relative acceleration_ of one geodesic to another in curved spacetime is given by the _[geodesic deviation equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic\_deviation\_equation "Geodesic deviation equation")_:

![Image 59: {\displaystyle {\frac {D^{2}\xi ^{\alpha }}{ds^{2}}}=-R^{\alpha }{}_{\beta \gamma \delta }{\frac {dx^{\alpha }}{ds}}\xi ^{\gamma }{\frac {dx^{\delta }}{ds}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3ea6a3cc5f0c288beb4dce94cda1782276a23e15)

where **ξ**_α_ = _x_ 2 _α_ − _x_ 1 _α_ is the separation vector between two geodesics, ⁠_D_/_ds_⁠ (_not_ just ⁠_d_/_ds_⁠) is the [covariant derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariant_derivative "Covariant derivative"), and _R α βγδ_ is the [Riemann curvature tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_curvature_tensor "Riemann curvature tensor"), containing the Christoffel symbols. In other words, the geodesic deviation equation is the equation of motion for masses in curved spacetime, analogous to the Lorentz force equation for charges in an electromagnetic field.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_motion#cite_note-Gravitation-18): 34–35

For flat spacetime, the metric is a constant tensor so the Christoffel symbols vanish, and the geodesic equation has the solutions of straight lines. This is also the limiting case when masses move according to [Newton's law of gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_gravity "Newton's law of gravity").

In general relativity, rotational motion is described by the [relativistic angular momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativistic_angular_momentum "Relativistic angular momentum") tensor, including the [spin tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_tensor "Spin tensor"), which enter the equations of motion under [covariant derivatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariant_derivative "Covariant derivative") with respect to [proper time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_time "Proper time"). The [Mathisson–Papapetrou–Dixon equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathisson%E2%80%93Papapetrou%E2%80%93Dixon_equations "Mathisson–Papapetrou–Dixon equations") describe the motion of spinning objects moving in a [gravitational field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_field "Gravitational field").

Analogues for waves and fields
------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Equations_of_motion&action=edit&section=20 "Edit section: Analogues for waves and fields")]

Unlike the equations of motion for describing particle mechanics, which are systems of coupled ordinary differential equations, the analogous equations governing the dynamics of [waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_(physics) "Wave (physics)") and [fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(physics) "Field (physics)") are always [partial differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation "Partial differential equation"), since the waves or fields are functions of space and time. For a particular solution, [boundary conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_conditions "Boundary conditions") along with initial conditions need to be specified.

Sometimes in the following contexts, the wave or field equations are also called "equations of motion".

Equations that describe the spatial dependence and [time evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_evolution "Time evolution") of fields are called _[field equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field\_equation "Field equation")_. These include

*   [Maxwell's equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations "Maxwell's equations") for the [electromagnetic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_field "Electromagnetic field"),
*   [Poisson's equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson%27s_equation "Poisson's equation") for [Newtonian gravitational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newtonian_gravitation "Newtonian gravitation") or [electrostatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrostatic "Electrostatic") field potentials,
*   the [Einstein field equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_field_equation "Einstein field equation") for [gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitation "Gravitation") ([Newton's law of gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_gravity "Newton's law of gravity") is a special case for weak gravitational fields and low velocities of particles).

This terminology is not universal: for example although the [Navier–Stokes equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_equations "Navier–Stokes equations") govern the [velocity field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity_field "Velocity field") of a [fluid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid "Fluid"), they are not usually called "field equations", since in this context they represent the momentum of the fluid and are called the "momentum equations" instead.

Equations of wave motion are called _[wave equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave\_equation "Wave equation")_. The solutions to a wave equation give the time-evolution and spatial dependence of the [amplitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude "Amplitude"). Boundary conditions determine if the solutions describe [traveling waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traveling_wave "Traveling wave") or [standing waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_waves "Standing waves").

From classical equations of motion and field equations; mechanical, [gravitational wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_wave "Gravitational wave"), and [electromagnetic wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_wave "Electromagnetic wave") equations can be derived. The general linear wave equation in 3D is:

![Image 60: {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{v^{2}}}{\frac {\partial ^{2}X}{\partial t^{2}}}=\nabla ^{2}X}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/550b8e0d5020f1353109376de439467b2850698f)

where _X_ = _X_(**r**, _t_) is any mechanical or electromagnetic field amplitude, say:[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_motion#cite_note-20)

*   the [transverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transverse_wave "Transverse wave") or [longitudinal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitudinal_wave "Longitudinal wave")[displacement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_(vector) "Displacement (vector)") of a vibrating rod, wire, cable, membrane etc.,
*   the fluctuating [pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure "Pressure") of a medium, [sound pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_pressure "Sound pressure"),
*   the [electric fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_field "Electric field")**E** or **D**, or the [magnetic fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field "Magnetic field")**B** or **H**,
*   the [voltage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage "Voltage")_V_ or [current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current "Electric current")_I_ in an [alternating current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternating_current "Alternating current") circuit,

and _v_ is the [phase velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_velocity "Phase velocity"). Nonlinear equations model the dependence of phase velocity on amplitude, replacing _v_ by _v_(_X_). There are other linear and nonlinear wave equations for very specific applications, see for example the [Korteweg–de Vries equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korteweg%E2%80%93de_Vries_equation "Korteweg–de Vries equation").

In quantum theory, the wave and field concepts both appear.

In [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics") the analogue of the classical equations of motion (Newton's law, Euler–Lagrange equation, Hamilton–Jacobi equation, etc.) is the [Schrödinger equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation "Schrödinger equation") in its most general form:

![Image 61: {\displaystyle i\hbar {\frac {\partial \Psi }{\partial t}}={\hat {H}}\Psi \,,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/01e4912007a42006294bf98ea9c8ea84a225ce4d)

where _Ψ_ is the [wavefunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefunction "Wavefunction") of the system, _Ĥ_ is the quantum [Hamiltonian operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_operator "Hamiltonian operator"), rather than a function as in classical mechanics, and _ħ_ is the [Planck constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant "Planck constant") divided by 2 π. Setting up the Hamiltonian and inserting it into the equation results in a wave equation, the solution is the wavefunction as a function of space and time. The Schrödinger equation itself reduces to the Hamilton–Jacobi equation when one considers the [correspondence principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correspondence_principle "Correspondence principle"), in the limit that _ħ_ becomes zero. To compare to measurements, operators for observables must be applied the quantum wavefunction according to the experiment performed, leading to either [wave-like or particle-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave-particle_duality "Wave-particle duality") results.

Throughout all aspects of quantum theory, relativistic or non-relativistic, there are [various formulations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_formulation_of_quantum_mechanics "Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics") alternative to the Schrödinger equation that govern the time evolution and behavior of a quantum system, for instance:

*   the [Heisenberg equation of motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisenberg_picture "Heisenberg picture") resembles the time evolution of classical observables as functions of position, momentum, and time, if one replaces dynamical observables by their [quantum operators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_(physics) "Operator (physics)") and the classical [Poisson bracket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_bracket "Poisson bracket") by the [commutator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutator "Commutator"),
*   the [phase space formulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_space_formulation "Phase space formulation") closely follows classical Hamiltonian mechanics, placing position and momentum on equal footing,
*   the Feynman [path integral formulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_integral_formulation "Path integral formulation") extends the [principle of least action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_action "Principle of least action") to quantum mechanics and field theory, placing emphasis on the use of a Lagrangians rather than Hamiltonians.
