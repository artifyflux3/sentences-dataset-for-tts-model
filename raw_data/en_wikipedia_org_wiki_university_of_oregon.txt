Founded in 1876, [ 9 ] the university is organized into nine colleges and schools [ 10 ] and offers 420 undergraduate and graduate degree programs.

[ 11 ] The university also operates the Ballmer Institute for Children's Behavioral Health in Portland, Oregon ; the Oregon Institute of Marine Biology in Charleston, Oregon ; and Pine Mountain Observatory in Central Oregon .

UO's 295-acre campus is situated along the Willamette River .

[ 12 ] Most academic programs follow the 10-week quarter system .

[ 13 ] The university is classified among "R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity" and is a member of the Association of American Universities .

[ 14 ] [ 15 ] Since July 2014, UO has been governed by its own board of trustees .

UO student-athletes compete as the Oregon Ducks and are part of the Big Ten Conference in the NCAA Division I .

[ 16 ] With eighteen varsity teams, the Oregon Ducks are best known for their football team and track and field program.

[ 17 ] [ 18 ] These two teams are even incorporated into the design of the school's "O" logo.

[ 19 ] In the summer of 2022, UO hosted the 2022 World Athletics Championships . It was the first time the event was held in the United States.

[ 20 ] The university has a long and complex relationship with Nike, Inc.

, and the firm's co-founder Phil Knight .

[ 21 ] [ 22 ] As a consequence of state higher-education disinvestment starting in the 1990s, UO has embraced a "University of Nike" image.

[ 22 ] Fueled by large investments in athletic infrastructure, this trend has accelerated in recent years. Knight, an alumnus, has advocated for both athletic prominence and increased privatisation of the university, and has donated over $1 billion to UO since the late-1980s, much of it going towards athletics.

[ 23 ] [ 24 ] The school's "O" logo was designed by Nike in 1998 and sports facility projects on campus typically involve both Knight and Nike.

[ 19 ] [ 25 ] [ 21 ] The university's motto, mens agitat molem comes from the Aeneid by Virgil ,(Book VI, line 727).

[ 26 ] History Establishment Prior to the establishment of the university in 1872, most of Oregon's colleges were denominational. While the Oregon State Legislature drafted a bill in 1872 to form the university, a citizens group from Eugene, the Union University Association (UUA), formed and began campaigning to make the university non-denominational. During a legislative meeting in September 1872, the UUA would succeed in amending the bill to include a non-denominational clause.

[ 27 ] The bill eventually was passed by the state legislature in 1872, establishing the institution as Oregon State University.

[ 28 ] The residents of Eugene raised $27,500 to buy eighteen acres of land at a cost of $2,500.

[ 29 ] Early years University and Villard Halls, the first two buildings on campus The university opened in 1876 under the name of "Oregon State University" and University Hall as its sole building.

[ 30 ] The first year of enrollment contained 155 students taught by five faculty members. The first graduating class was in 1878, graduating five students.

[ 28 ] In 1881, the university was nearly closed; it was $8,000 in debt before Henry Villard donated $7,000 to help pay it.

[ 28 ] In 1913 and 1932, there were proposals to merge the university with what is now Oregon State University . Both proposals were defeated.

[ 31 ] [ 32 ] Maturity as a university During Prince Lucien Campbell's tenure as president from 1902 to 1925, the university experienced tremendous growth. The budget, enrollment, facilities, and faculty members all grew several times its amount prior to his presidency.

[ 31 ] Numerous schools were also established during his tenure, including the School of Music in 1902, the School of Education in 1910, the School of Architecture , the College of Business in 1914, the School of Law in 1915, the School of Journalism in 1916, and the School of Health and Physical Education in 1920.

[ 31 ] However, the University of Oregon lost its School of Engineering to Oregon Agricultural College , now known as Oregon State University .

Enrollment numbers include both undergraduate and graduate students.

Source: IR In 1917, a "three term" (quarter system) calendar was adopted by the university faculty as a war-time measure.

[ 33 ] [ 34 ] This academic calendar has remained ever since then. However, it is now referred to as the Quarter System.

The Zorn-MacPherson Bill in 1932 proposed the University of Oregon and Oregon State College (now "University") merge. The bill lost in a landslide vote of over 6 to 1.

[ 35 ] The University of Oregon Medical School was founded in 1887 in Portland and merged with Willamette University 's program in 1913. However, in 1974 it became an independent institution known as Oregon Health Sciences University .

[ 36 ] The Institute of Molecular Biology was established at the university in 1959.

[ 37 ] UO served as the filming location for the 1978 cult classic National Lampoon's Animal House .

[ 38 ] [ 39 ] [ 40 ] Golden age The 60s and 70s were somewhat of a golden age for the university. In 1964, the university ranked 25th nationally in National Science Foundation basic research grants, ahead of the University of Rochester, Northwestern University, the University of Colorado and the University of Pittsburgh.

[ 41 ] In 1969, the UO was admitted into the Association of American Universities , along with Case Western Reserve University, the University of Maryland, and the University of Southern California.

[ 15 ] Graduate enrollment peaked during the 1978-79 academic year at 4,568.

[ 42 ] From 1970 to 1979, 2,614 doctoral degrees were awarded at UO cumulatively.

[ 43 ] From 1970 to 1979, 817 UO undergraduate students would go on to earn doctoral degrees at UO or another institution. Despite increases in total undergraduate enrollment since the 60s and 70s, fewer UO undergraduate students would go on to earn doctorates in the 80s, 90s, 2000s and 2010s.

[ 44 ] UO experienced state disinvestment in the 1980s during the tenure of president Paul Olum.

[ 28 ] Further state disinvestment occurred during the 1990s and during the Great Recession.

[ 45 ] Many programs have been scaled back or eliminated.

Recent history In recent years UO's administration and Board of Trustees have approved hundreds of millions of dollars in construction projects. These facilities include Matthew Knight Arena, the Ford Alumni Center, the EMU renovation (student union building), and dormitories.

[ 46 ] This has occurred in tandem with state budget reductions, tuition increases, and increases in out-of-state enrollment.

[ 47 ] In 2016, the university removed the name of Frederic Stanley Dunn , head of the Classics department in the 1920s and 30s, from the dormitory Dunn Hall, because of his leading role in the Ku Klux Klan .

[ 48 ] [ 49 ] Declining state support Measure 5 established limits on property taxes in Oregon. This impacted the state budget, and led to budget and programmatic cuts at UO starting the 1990s.

[ 50 ] The College of Human Performance and Development was closed. Furthermore, many of the school's primary and secondary teacher training programs were eliminated.

[ 51 ] By 1997, more than 20 other programs were closed or significantly reduced in size.

UO has initiated three capital campaigns in the last 30 years.

[ 52 ] [ 53 ] The first campaign of this era was launched with a goal of $150 million. It ended up raising a total of $255.3 million between 1992 and 1998.

[ 54 ] With financial support from the state dwindling from 40% to 13% of the university budget, [ 52 ] in January 2001, University President Dave Frohnmayer began Campaign Oregon with the goal of raising $600 million by December 2008, the most ambitious philanthropic fundraising campaign in the state's history at the time.

[ 55 ] With contributions exceeding $100 million from benefactors such as Phil Knight and Lorry I. Lokey , the campaign goal was exceeded by over $253 million.

[ 52 ] [ 56 ] In the fall of 2014, the institution announced that it would attempt to raise $2 billion from donors. In the fall of 2018, the campaign revised its goal to $3 billion.

[ 57 ] Substantial gifts were donated by Phil Knight and his wife. In October 2016, it was announced Phil Knight and his wife Penny will contribute $500 million to establish the Phil and Penny Knight Campus for Accelerating Scientific Impact. At the time it was the largest donation to a public research university.

[ 58 ] Knight gave an additional $500 million to the Knight Campus in 2021.

[ 24 ] In 2022, Steve Ballmer made a large gift of $425 million to fund a new institute for children's behavioral health .

[ 59 ] [ 60 ] Despite the recent influx in private gifts given by mega-donors, as of 2020, UO's state subsidy per resident student is one of the lowest in both the Association of American Universities and Pac-12 Conference.

[ 45 ] [ 61 ] "University of Nike" See also: Nike and the University of Oregon The school's "O" logo was officially adopted by the university as a whole in 2002. Designed by Nike , it was first adopted by the athletic program in late-1998. The inside of the logo is said to depict Hayward Field , the institution's track and field venue. The outside of the logo is said to represent Autzen Stadium , which is UO's football stadium.

[ 25 ] The "O" logo was designed by Nike Phil Knight has financed hundreds of millions of dollars worth of construction projects on UO's campus going back to the late-1980s. Knight contributed to the renovation and expansion of the Main Library, now called the Knight Library , and the construction of the William W. Knight Law Center.

[ 62 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] Knight did not make a major contribution to academics between 1996 and 2016.

[ 24 ] [ 63 ] [ 64 ] Knight is an athletic booster .

[ 65 ] He has contributed to, and managed, the construction of various athletic department facilities. Knight's involvement in said projects usually does not involve any university oversight, making them controversial.

[ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ 66 ] Knight also financed the majority of the Hayward Field renovation project.

[ 23 ] Major publications including the New York Times and Wall Street Journal have described the university as the "University of Nike".

[ 21 ] [ 67 ] A book titled The University of Nike , written by Joshua Hunt, describes Nike and Phil Knight's influence on the university.

[ 22 ] As of 2022, [update] 16.5% of UO's gross square footage is purpose-built for the university's sports programs.

[ 68 ] Push for independence In 2010, the newly installed UO president, Richard Lariviere, proposed establishing a new governance and funding model for UO. The New Partnership, as it became known, sought to establish an independent board and large endowment to fund the university into the future. Funding had become too low and unpredictable for UO officials, and the new model would provide the university with a consistent stream of funding and the legal freedom to borrow money for large capital projects. Lariviere's proposal called for $800 million in state bonds and "an equal amount" of private gifts. The new funds would provide a large boost to UO's then modest endowment.

[ 69 ] In a 2010 interview, UO booster Phil Knight discussed the New Partnership. Knight explained that Lariviere's plan would allow UO greater control and possibly allow it to set its own tuition for in-state students.

[ 70 ] Oh, I talk to [Lariviere] on a regular basis. I spoke with him a couple of days ago. He was mostly talking about -- his view is the next step to upgrade the academic side of the university is to get the Legislature to go along with his plan, which is a little bit complicated, but it's to take a step -- I hate to use the word because it's an oversimplification -- but to take a step toward becoming more of a private university. I think the state provides about 7 percent of the funding now, so basically it is a private university that's hamstrung by public policy ... He's hamstrung in the sense he can't charge more tuition than the Legislature will let him do for in-state kids. So he loses money on every state kid that enrolls in the University of Oregon and he makes money on every kid that comes from out of state. So, increasingly, it's become the University of California at Eugene. That's the result of the current Legislature's policies.

[ 70 ] — Phil Knight (2010) On March 31, 2012, a Political Action Committee called Oregonians For Higher Education Excellence was formed by Columbia Sportswear CEO Tim Boyle .

[ 71 ] As of May 23, 2012, the organization has raised over $320,000. Notable contributors to the PAC include, Phil Knight , Patrick Kilkenny, and Tim Boyle. According to Boyle, the PAC's stated goal was to help facilitate an increase in autonomy at the University of Oregon.

[ 72 ] In reaction to a growing movement to establish an independent university board, the Oregon Legislature in 2013 passed SB 270, requiring local governing boards for the state's three largest institutions.

[ 73 ] [ 74 ] In 2014, the University of Oregon became an independent public body governed by the Board of Trustees of the University of Oregon . Proponents of local governing boards claimed that an independent board would give the university more autonomy and free it from inadequate state funding.

[ 75 ] This change of the board structure that eventually allowed the University of Oregon to leave the Pac12 and move to the Big10 without consideration for other state-funded universities in the state, i.e. Oregon State.

Michael H. Schill became the university's president in the summer of 2015.

[ 76 ] In June 2015, UO's endowment surpassed the $700 million mark.

[ 77 ] In 2022, Schill became president at Northwestern University.

[ 78 ] Karl Scholz has been president since July 1, 2023.

[ 79 ] Campus Main article: Campus of the University of Oregon Map of the campus Lillis Business Complex The campus is spread over 295 acres (119 ha) and includes eighty buildings . Additionally, the campus is an arboretum consisting of 500 species of trees.

[ 80 ] In total there are over 3,000 trees on campus.

[ 12 ] It is adjacent to the West University neighborhood and Pioneer Cemetery . Eugene is near many prominent geographic features such as the Willamette River , the Cascade Mountain Range , and the Pacific Ocean. Also, within a two-hour drive is the Portland metropolitan area.

The campus is occupied by approximately 80 buildings. However, there are several ongoing construction projects, as well as plans to build new facilities.

[ 81 ] The campus is the home of the Oregon Bach Festival .

Based on Ellis F. Lawrence's vision, many of the university's buildings are planned around several major quadrangles, many of which abut the 13th Avenue pedestrian mall.

[ 82 ] The university is known for being the site of a pioneering participatory planning experiment known as the Oregon Experiment , which is also the subject of a book of the same name that evolved into the well known book A Pattern Language by Christopher Alexander . The project's two major principles are buildings should be designed, in part, by the people who will use them with the help of an "architect facilitator", and construction should occur over many small projects as opposed to a few large ones.

Although academic buildings are spread throughout the campus, most are along East 13th Avenue, with heavy pedestrian traffic at the intersection with Kincaid Street.

[ 83 ] Student recreation and union centers are toward the center of the campus, with residence halls on the east side. Sports facilities are grouped in the southern-central part of campus with the Autzen Stadium and PK Park complexes across the Willamette River. The university also owns and operates several satellite facilities, including a large facility in the White Stag Block of downtown Portland and the Oregon Institute of Marine Biology in Charleston, Oregon.

The University of Oregon is home to the Jordan Schnitzer Museum of Art and the Museum of Natural and Cultural History .

The campus has been smoke and tobacco free since 2012.

[ 12 ] Old campus and memorial quad Knight Library The oldest section of campus is in the northwest area of the current campus. The university's first building, University Hall , opened on October 16, 1876, when the university had an enrollment of 177 students. It was known as "the building" before being named after Judge Matthew Deady in 1893. In June 2020, Deady's name was removed from the building in and it was temporarily renamed University Hall.

[ 84 ] The second building on campus is known as Villard Hall and is home to the Theater Arts and Comparative Literature Departments. Completed in 1886, the hall was named after railroad magnate Henry Villard , who provided financial aid to the university in 1881. Before its naming, it was known as "the new building". Both University and Villard Halls were designated National Historic Landmarks in 1977.

[ 85 ] Just south of Old Campus is the Memorial Quad, which runs north and south along Kincaid Street, capped at both ends by the main campus library, Knight Library , on the south side, and the Lillis Business Complex on the north. It is flanked on the west by the tallest building on campus, Prince Lucien Campbell Hall , also known as "PLC", Condon Hall on the west, housing the Geography department, and the Jordan Schnitzer Museum of Art on the east, which was remodeled and reopened on January 23, 2005. Also adjacent to Memorial Quad is Chapman Hall , which houses the Robert D. Clark Honors College.

Central campus Johnson Hall The center of campus houses a mixture of academic buildings, an administration building, and student recreation buildings. Just to the east of Memorial Quad and facing 13th Avenue is Johnson Hall , where offices for higher administration and trustee offices are found, including the offices of the university president. Directly across 13th Avenue and facing Johnson Hall is The Pioneer , a statue of a bearded, buckskin-clad pioneer cast in bronze by sculptor Alexander Phimister Proctor in 1919.

[ 86 ] In 1932, Proctor's Pioneer Mother statue was dedicated in the Women's Memorial Quadrangle on the other side of Johnson Hall; the two statues are aligned so that they can "see" one another through the large windows of the hall's main floor.

Lawrence Hall is located at the end of a hardscape walkway directly north of the intersection of 13th Avenue and University Street. It houses the College of Design and was renamed after Ellis F. Lawrence , its first dean, in 1957.

[ 87 ] Allen Hall, opened in 1954, is adjacent to Lawrence Hall and houses the School of Journalism and Communication.

[ 88 ] Additionally, the Erb Memorial Union and the recreation center are in this part of campus.

Lorry I. Lokey Science Complex and east campus Willamette Hall, the centerpiece of the university's physics department The Lorry I. Lokey Science Complex comprises multiple science buildings to the east of Lawrence Hall, on the north side of 13th Avenue. Willamette Hall's Paul Olum Atrium is the center of the university's hard sciences complex. The construction of Willamette Hall , home of the physics department; Cascade Hall, home of the geology department; Deschutes Hall , home of the Computer and Information Science Department; and Streisinger Hall to the complex were completed in 1989.

[ 89 ] Within the Lokey Science Complex are two facilities focused on integrative science.

[ 90 ] One is the Lokey Laboratories, which is a shared-use facility with state-of-the-art characterization instrumentation. Lokey Laboratories is associated with the Oregon Nanoscience and Microtechnologies Institute (ONAMI) and was dedicated to Lorry I. Lokey in 2008, for his $25 million donation toward the project.

[ 91 ] The Allan Price Science Commons and Research Library is also within the Lokey Science Complex. It underwent a major renovation and expansion with the new building reopening in 2016.

[ 92 ] Knight Law Center The northeast corner of campus is home to the Ford Alumni Center and Matthew Knight Arena . Most of the rest of the eastern part of campus is dedicated to residence halls. Carson Hall, near the Erb Memorial Union, provides dining services along with dormitories. Just south is the Living-Learning Center, opened in 2006. It is a collection of functions including dormitories, classrooms, study areas, dining rooms, and recreational rooms to provide a single location for many student activities.

[ 93 ] The newest residence hall, the Global Scholars Hall , opened in the fall of 2012. It primarily houses returning students and students enrolled in the Robert D. Clark Honors College, College Scholars, and the global scholars language programs.

[ 94 ] South campus The center of south campus is where much of the on-campus athletic facilities reside.

Hayward Field , home to the Ducks track and field program, sits in the eastern area of the athletic facilities. It has hosted a number of prominent track and field events such as the US Track and Field Olympic Trials, the NCAA Track and Field Championships, and USATF Championships.

[ 95 ] To the west of the athletic facilities lies Pioneer Cemetery and further west is where the current facilities for the College of Education exists, in the southwest corner of campus. The HEDCO Education building and the Frohnmayer Music Center are in the vicinity. The Knight Law Center is just opposite of Hayward Field in the southeast corner of campus. The Many Nations Longhouse and the Museum of Natural and Cultural History are East of Knight Law.

Knight campus The Phil and Penny Knight Campus for Accelerating Scientific Impact is a billion dollar applied science campus. The campus is on the north side of Franklin Boulevard.

[ 96 ] Phil and Penny Knight contributed two $500 million gifts to the campus.

[ 97 ] The rest of the funding is expected to come from state bonds and private support.

[ 98 ] It is hoped that Knight Campus will help grow Oregon's biotechnology sector and generate economic growth for the state.

[ 99 ] However, professors at other institutions caution that nothing is guaranteed, and that creating a new economic hub from scratch is a tricky process.

[ 100 ] Other areas and satellites The controversial [ 101 ] Riverfront Research Park is a small facility maintained by the university. It is used for creating new technologies, such as research about artificial intelligence at the Computational Intelligence Research Lab, and it is the home of the Zebrafish Information Network (ZFIN), the zebrafish model organism database. Controversy stems from the lack of citizen involvement in the planning process for the use of public lands, and the potential for multi-story office buildings and parking lots to replace open space, civic space, and wildlife habitat along the Willamette River. The university and student senates have each passed resolutions [ 102 ] [ 103 ] against construction on the banks of the Willamette River under the current development plan, yet plans for development persist. In March 2010, the issue of a conditional use permit extension for the Research Park was appealed to the Land Use Board of Appeals by a group of citizens, students, and faculty.

[ 104 ] In 2022, UO purchased the campus of the now-closed Concordia University in Portland and converted it to the main campus of UO Portland.

[ 105 ] The university leases space in Old Town Portland in the White Stag Block as UO Portland Downtown, which was the main Portland campus until the Concordia campus purchase.

[ 106 ] Sustainability The undergraduate architecture program is consistently ranked among the highest in the country, and is currently ranked as the #1 public program for "Sustainable Design Practice and Principles" by DesignIntelligence magazine.

[ 107 ] The University of Oregon received a grade of "B+" from the Sustainable Endowments Institute on its last published College Sustainability Report Card in 2011.

[ 108 ] There has also been a push for sustainable buildings on campus with a development plan that requires any new building or renovation to incorporate sustainable design.

[ 109 ] The Lillis Business Complex was the catalyst for the policy. The building, completed in 2003 [ 110 ] has earned a LEED Silver rating, the highest rating of any college business building in the United States. As of 2016 [update] , there were 15 different buildings on campus that have been awarded LEED Silver or above ratings.

[ 111 ] Organization and administration Colleges and Schools College of Arts and Sciences School of Global Studies and Languages Charles H. Lundquist College of Business School of Accounting College of Design School of Architecture & Environment School of Art + Design School of Planning, Public Policy and Management College of Education Robert D. Clark Honors College Division of Graduate Studies School of Journalism and Communication School of Law School of Music and Dance The university is accredited by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities , [ 112 ] which is recognized by the United States Department of Education .

Governance The university's internal governance is conducted in accordance with The Constitution of the University of Oregon . The UO Constitution provides a collaborative process that ensures a strong voice for the faculty, acting through the University Senate. The representation of students, civil servants, and administrative employees in the senate ensures this predominantly faculty body operates in the best interests of the entire university community.

[ 113 ] UO Board of Trustees assumed control in 2014. The trustees have the broad authority to supervise and manage the university and may exercise all the powers, rights, duties and privileges expressly granted by law or that are implied by law or are incident to the board's powers, rights, duties and privileges.

[ 114 ] Former provost Scott Coltrane served as interim president, from August 6, 2014, through June 30, 2015, following the resignation of Michael Gottfredson.

[ 115 ] This resignation occurred with less than 24 hours notice amidst a number of controversies, including allegations of mishandling of sexual violence, [ 116 ] a decline of $100 million in university donations, [ 117 ] and the alienation of faculty members around unionization and academic freedom.

[ 118 ] Including one interim president, Gottfredson was the university's fourth president in six years, a situation that led Chronicle of Higher Education to label the position a "revolving door".

[ 119 ] Michael H. Schill was president from 2015 to 2022.

[ 78 ] John Karl Scholz entered office as the 19th president in 2023.
