[ 1 ] The measure is also widely used in archaeology for the reconstruction of past diets, particularly to see if marine foods or certain types of plants were consumed.

[ 2 ] The definition is, in per mille : δ δ C 13 = ( ( C 13 / C 12 ) s a m p l e ( C 13 / C 12 ) s t a n d a r d − − 1 ) × × 1000 {\displaystyle \delta {\ce {^{13}C}}=\left({\frac {({\ce {^{13}C}}/{\ce {^{12}C}})_{\mathrm {sample} }}{({\ce {^{13}C}}/{\ce {^{12}C}})_{\mathrm {standard} }}}-1\right)\times 1000} where the standard is an established reference material .

δ 13 C varies in time as a function of productivity, the signature of the inorganic source, organic carbon burial , and vegetation type. Biological processes preferentially take up the lower mass isotope through kinetic fractionation . However some abiotic processes do the same. For example, methane from hydrothermal vents can be depleted by up to 50‰.

[ 3 ] Reference standard [ edit ] The standard established for carbon-13 work was the Pee Dee Belemnite (PDB) and was based on a Cretaceous marine fossil, Belemnitella americana , which was from the Peedee Formation in South Carolina . This material had an anomalously high 13 C: 12 C ratio (0.0112372 [ 4 ] ), and was established as δ 13 C value of zero.

Since the original PDB specimen is no longer available, its 13 C: 12 C ratio can be back-calculated from a widely measured carbonate standard NBS-19, which has a δ 13 C value of +1.95‰.

[ 5 ] The 13 C: 12 C ratio of NBS-19 was reported as 0.011078 / 0.988922 = 0.011202 {\displaystyle 0.011078/0.988922=0.011202} .

[ 6 ] Therefore, one could calculate the 13 C: 12 C ratio of PDB derived from NBS-19 as 0.011202 / ( 1.95 / 1000 + 1 ) = 0.011202 / 1.00195 = 0.01118 {\displaystyle 0.011202/(1.95/1000+1)=0.011202/1.00195=0.01118} .

Note that this value differs from the widely used PDB 13 C: 12 C ratio of 0.0112372 used in isotope forensics [ 7 ] and environmental scientists; [ 8 ] this discrepancy was previously attributed by a Wikipedia author to a sign error in the interconversion between standards, but no citation was provided. Use of the PDB standard gives most natural material a negative δ 13 C.

[ 9 ] A material with a ratio of 0.010743 for example would have a δ 13 C value of −44‰ from ( 0.010743 ÷ ÷ 0.01124 − − 1 ) × × 1000 {\displaystyle (0.010743\div 0.01124-1)\times 1000} .

The standards are used for verifying the accuracy of mass spectroscopy ; as isotope studies became more common, the demand for the standard exhausted the supply.  Other standards calibrated to the same ratio, including one known as VPDB (for "Vienna PDB"), have replaced the original.

[ 10 ] The 13 C: 12 C ratio for VPDB, which the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) defines as a δ 13 C value of zero is 0.01123720.

[ 11 ] Causes of δ 13 C variations [ edit ] Methane has a very light δ 13 C signature: biogenic methane of −60‰, thermogenic methane −40‰. The release of large amounts of methane clathrate can affect global δ 13 C values, as at the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum .

[ 12 ] More commonly, the ratio is affected by variations in primary productivity and organic burial.  Organisms preferentially take up light 12 C, and have a δ 13 C signature of about −25‰, depending on their metabolic pathway .  Therefore, an increase in δ 13 C in marine fossils is indicative of an increase in the abundance of vegetation.

[ citation needed ] An increase in primary productivity causes a corresponding rise in δ 13 C values as more 12 C is locked up in plants.  This signal is also a function of the amount of carbon burial; when organic carbon is buried, more 12 C is locked out of the system in sediments than the background ratio.

Geologic significance [ edit ] C 3 and C 4 plants have different signatures, allowing the abundance of C 4 grasses to be detected through time in the δ 13 C record.

[ 13 ] Whereas C 4 plants have a δ 13 C of −16 to −10‰, C 3 plants have a δ 13 C of −33 to −24‰.

[ 14 ] Positive and negative excursions [ edit ] Positive δ 13 C excursions are interpreted as an increase in burial of organic carbon in sedimentary rocks following either a spike in primary productivity, a drop in decomposition under anoxic ocean conditions or both.

[ 15 ] For example, the evolution of large land plants in the late Devonian led to increased organic carbon burial and consequently a rise in δ 13 C.
