The **tzolkʼin**[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tzolk%CA%BCin#cite_note-1) (Mayan pronunciation:[[t͡sol ˈkʼin]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Mayan "Help:IPA/Mayan"), formerly and commonly **tzolkin**) is the 260-day [Mesoamerican calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_calendars "Mesoamerican calendars") used by the [Maya civilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_civilization "Maya civilization") of [pre-Columbian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-Columbian "Pre-Columbian")[Mesoamerica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica "Mesoamerica").[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

The tzolkʼin, the basic cycle of the [Maya calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_calendar "Maya calendar"), is a preeminent component in the society and rituals of the ancient and the modern Maya. The tzolkʼin is still used by several [Maya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_peoples "Maya peoples") communities in the [Guatemalan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guatemala "Guatemala") highlands. While its use has been spreading in this region, this practice is opposed by [Evangelical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelicalism "Evangelicalism") Christian converts in some Maya communities.

The word _tzolkʼin_, meaning "division of days",[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] is a western [coinage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neologism "Neologism") in [Yucatec Maya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucatec_Maya_language "Yucatec Maya language"). Contemporary Maya groups who have maintained an unbroken count for over 500 years in the tzolk'in use other terms in their languages. For instance, the [Kʼicheʼ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%CA%BCiche%CA%BC_people "Kʼicheʼ people") use the term _Aj Ilabal Qʼij_ [aχ ilaɓal qʼiχ] or _Raj Ilabal Qʼij_ [ɾaχ ilaɓal qʼiχ], 'the sense of the day' or 'the round of the days'[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] and the [Kaqchikel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaqchikel_people "Kaqchikel people") use the term _Chol Qʼij_ [t͡ʃol qʼiχ], 'the organization of time'.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] The names of this calendar among the pre-Columbian Maya are not widely known. The corresponding Postclassic [Aztec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztec "Aztec") calendar was called _[tonalpohualli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonalpohualli "Tonalpohualli")_ in the [Nahuatl language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nahuatl_language "Nahuatl language").

The twenty day names
--------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tzolk%CA%BCin&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: The twenty day names")]

The tzolkʼin calendar combines a cycle of twenty named days with another cycle of thirteen numbers (the _[trecena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trecena "Trecena")_), to produce 260 unique days (20 × 13 = 260).[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tzolk%CA%BCin#cite_note-2) Each successive named day is numbered from 1 to 13, and then starting again at 1.

The 20 individual named days are the following:

| NOTES: 1. _The sequence number of the named day in the Tzolkʼin calendar_ 2. _Day name, in the standardized and revised orthography of the Guatemalan Academia de Lenguas Mayas_ 3. _An example glyph ([logogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logogram "Logogram")) for the named day, typical of monumental inscriptions ("[cartouche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartouche "Cartouche")" version). Note that for most of these, several alternate forms also exist._ 4. _Example glyph, [Maya codex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya\_codices "Maya codices") style. When drawn or painted, most often a more economical style of the glyph was used; the meaning is the same. Again, variations to codex-style glyphs also exist._ 5. _Day name, as recorded from 16th-century [Yucatec language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucatec\_language "Yucatec language") accounts, according to [Diego de Landa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego\_de\_Landa "Diego de Landa"); this orthography has (until recently) been widely used_ 6. _In most cases, the day name as spoken in the time of the Classic Period (c. 200–900), when most inscriptions were made, is not known. The versions given here (in [Classical Maya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic\_Maya\_language "Classic Maya language"), the main language of the inscriptions) are reconstructed based on phonological comparisons; a '?' symbol indicates the reconstruction is tentative._ 7. _Each named day had a common association or identification with particular natural phenomena_ |

The tzolkʼin does not have a generally recognized start and end, although there are specific references in the books of _Chilam Balam_ to 1 Imix as the beginning day.

Each of the twenty days has its specific primary association connected to the day name's meaning.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tzolk%CA%BCin#cite_note-4)

The tzolkʼin was extensively used in Mayan inscriptions and codices. Symbolism related to the tzolkʼin is also observed in the [Popol Vuh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popol_Vuh "Popol Vuh") (which, though written in the early post-conquest period, is probably based on older texts). For instance, when [Xmucane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xmucane_and_Xpiacoc "Xmucane and Xpiacoc") has set an impossible task for [Xquic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xquic "Xquic") of collecting a netful of corn from one stalk and Xquic successfully completes it, she leaves the imprint of her net in the ground, and the day "net" is the opening of the [Venus cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Venus_cycle&action=edit&redlink=1 "Venus cycle (page does not exist)") which follows "ahau" ("ajpu" in Kʼicheʼ), just as her child is the heir of Hun Hunajpu.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tzolk%CA%BCin#cite_note-6)

The uses to which the ancient Maya applied the calendar are unknown, nonetheless modern Maya communities employ the calendar as follows:

*   For [Maize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maize "Maize") cultivation.(The [zenith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenith "Zenith") transit days may have been significant for agriculture along the south coast of [Guatemala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guatemala "Guatemala") because April 30 occurs just before the rainy season. Modern Maya plant their corn at the end of April or early in May. In the August 13 [zenith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenith "Zenith") transit **the Maya initiate its current era in this day'**, approximating the harvest of the dried corn.
*   For modern [Guatemalan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guatemala "Guatemala") highlanders, the 260 days are employed in training the **Aj Kʼij**, or 'calendar diviner'. Nine months after commencing training in divination, the novice is "reborn" and initiated into office. The tzolkʼin is explainable, in principle, as a calendar of midwives, since it counts 260 days from the 20 day period of the conception, from when the heart of the fetus starts to beat, until birth.
*   For rituals performed every 260 days. Most famous of these is the "Initiation" celebration of 8 Chuwen, _Waxakibʼ Bʼatz_, in the [Kʼiche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%CA%BCiche%CA%BC_people "Kʼicheʼ people") town of [Santa Cruz del Quiche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Cruz_del_Quiche "Santa Cruz del Quiche").
*   For days which are suitable for certain actions. For instance, a low-numbered Akʼabʼal or Bʼen would be a good day for a wedding, whereas Kʼan would be a good day for building or maintaining a house.
*   For [divination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divination "Divination") based on [casting lots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleromancy "Cleromancy") and counting forward through the calendar from the current 'year bearer' to arrive at a day which is then interpreted. This is not pure [cleromancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleromancy "Cleromancy") because somatic twitches of "blood lightning" can either be specifically consulted or arise spontaneously during the process.
*   For traditional Mayan names, which are based on calendar days, often birthdays.
*   Somewhat analogous to [astrology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrology "Astrology"), personal characteristics are believed to be influenced by the name of the day on which a person was born, and the success of some particular types of endeavor depend on carrying them out on a day whose name is auspicious for those actions.

The 260-day calendar spread throughout the Mesoamerican cultural region and is regarded as the oldest and most important of the calendar systems, with an origin predating its first appearances in Maya inscriptions.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tzolk%CA%BCin#cite_note-7) The earliest evidence of this calendar comes from a possible day sign with a dot numeral coefficient in an Olmec-like inscription in [Oxtotitlán](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxtotitl%C3%A1n "Oxtotitlán") cave dated to 800-500 BCE.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tzolk%CA%BCin#cite_note-8) Some of the next oldest calendric inscriptions are from early strata of [Zapotec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zapotec_civilization "Zapotec civilization") in the [Oaxacan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oaxaca "Oaxaca") highlands at sites such as [Monte Albán](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Alb%C3%A1n "Monte Albán"), dating from mid-1st millennium BCE. A few earlier-dated inscriptions and artifacts have what appear to be calendric glyphs, such as at [San José Mogote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Jos%C3%A9_Mogote "San José Mogote") and in the [Olmec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olmec "Olmec")[Gulf Coast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_Coast_of_Mexico "Gulf Coast of Mexico") region. However, either the dating method or the calendric nature of the glyphs are disputed by scholars.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tzolk%CA%BCin#cite_note-9) The earliest unequivocal written record is a 7 Deer day sign found in mural paintings at the central lowland Maya site of San Bartolo, Guatemala, dated to the 3rd century BCE,[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tzolk%CA%BCin#cite_note-10) but it is now obvious that the origin of the 260-day is much earlier. An archaeoastronomical study has shown that a number of architectural complexes built in the late second and early first millennia BCE in the area along the southern Gulf coast in Mexico are oriented to the Sun's positions on the horizon on certain dates, separated by multiples of 13 and 20 days. Since these were elementary periods of the 260-day cycle, the orientations marking these intervals can only be explained in association with this calendar. The dating of the earliest constructions indicates that it was in use by 1100 BCE.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tzolk%CA%BCin#cite_note-11)

The original purpose of such a calendar, with no obvious relation to any astronomical or geophysical cycle, is not securely known, but there are several theories. One theory is that the calendar came from mathematical operations based on the numbers thirteen and twenty, which were important numbers to the Maya, (Thompson 1950: Maya Hieroglyphic Writing:Introduction). The number twenty was the basis of the Maya counting system, taken from the total number of human digits. (See [Maya numerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_numerals "Maya numerals")). Thirteen symbolized the number of levels in the Upperworld where the gods lived, and is also cited by modern daykeepers as the number of "joints" in the human body (ankles, knees, hips, shoulders, elbows, wrists, and neck). The numbers multiplied together equal 260.

Barbara Tedlock studied this system in the contemporary Kʼiche Maya community of the municipality of [Momostenango](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momostenango "Momostenango") in highland Guatemala. She underwent a formal apprenticeship in calendar divination with a local adept, and was initiated as a diviner in 1976. She says: "The Momostecan calendar embraces both the 260-day cycle and the 365-day solar year, with the four Classic Maya Year-bearers, or Mam, systematically linking the two. The 260-day cycle is conceived as linked firmly to worldly or earthly affairs, mirroring no astronomical period but rather the period of human gestation. Past ethnographic accounts of this cycle contain various conflicting opinions as to what its first day is, but a comparison of the present results and those of previous studies indicates that there is no fixed first day."[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tzolk%CA%BCin#cite_note-12)

Anthony Aveni asserts, "Once a Maya genius may have recognized that somewhere deep within the calendar system lay the miraculous union, the magical crossing point of a host of time cycles: 9 moons, 13 times 20, a birth cycle, a planting cycle, a Venus cycle, a sun cycle, an eclipse cycle. The number 260 was tailor made for the Maya".[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tzolk%CA%BCin#cite_note-13) Others have observed that the "Venus Table" in the [Dresden Codex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dresden_Codex "Dresden Codex"), is an accurate ephemeris for predicting Venus positions.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tzolk%CA%BCin#cite_note-WDL-14) Others have also observed a basis for the 260-day cycle in the agricultural cycle of highland [Guatemala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guatemala "Guatemala"), which is also about 260 days. Aveni notes that "the average duration between successive halves of the eclipse season, at 173 ½ days, fits into the tzolkin in the ratio of 3 to 2."[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tzolk%CA%BCin#cite_note-15) This may seem contrived, but the Maya did employ the tzolkin to predict positions of Venus and eclipses.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

Another theory is that the 260-day period is the length of human [pregnancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestation "Gestation"). This is close to the average number of days between the _first missed_[menstrual period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_period "Menstrual period") and birth, unlike [Naegele's rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naegele%27s_rule "Naegele's rule") which is 40 weeks (280 days) between the _last_ menstrual period and birth. It is postulated that [midwives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwifery "Midwifery") originally developed the calendar to predict babies' expected birth dates.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tzolk%CA%BCin#cite_note-16)

Vincent Malmström[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tzolk%CA%BCin#cite_note-17) identifies a correlation between the 260-day cycle and the 260-day gap between zenithal passages of the [sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun "Sun"). According to this hypothesis, the 260-day cycle originated in the narrow [latitudinal band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude "Latitude") (14°42′N to 15°N) in which the sun is vertically overhead about 12–13 August and again 260 days later about 30 April– 1 May (Malmström identifies the proto-Classic [Izapan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izapa "Izapa") culture as one suitable candidate at this latitude). This period may have been used for the planting schedule of [maize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maize "Maize"). However, others object to this conception, noting that while the 260-day calendar runs continuously the interval between autumn-spring and spring-autumn positions alternates between 260 and 105 days, and that the earliest-known calendric inscriptions are from considerably farther north of this zone.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tzolk%CA%BCin#cite_note-18) Consequently, this theory is not widely supported.

It is also possible that the number 260 has multiple sources.

The tzolkʼin and the New Age movement
-------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tzolk%CA%BCin&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: The tzolkʼin and the New Age movement")]

The tzolkʼin is the basis for the modern, [New Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Age "New Age") invention of the "[Dreamspell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreamspell "Dreamspell")" calendar, developed by the esoteric author [José Argüelles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Arg%C3%BCelles "José Argüelles"). The Dreamspell calendar is sometimes mistakenly identified as an authentic interpretation or extension of the original Maya calendar, although Argüelles himself acknowledges the Dreamspell calendar is a new and syncretic creation, inspired by elements from Mesoamerican and non-Mesoamerican sources.

In 1987, before the [Harmonic Convergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_Convergence "Harmonic Convergence"), inspired by a single paragraph of Argüelles's book "The Mayan Factor" (wherein he refers to each day as a "tone"), singer/songwriter and sound healer, Alyras (aka Mirai), translated the tzolkʼin's harmonic values into sound, with the tutelage of Barbara Hero. Eschewing extensions of the tzolkʼin, Alyras opted for strict mathematical adherence to the tzolkʼin's fundamental structure and sequences, in order to present a truly authentic sonic expression of its inner workings.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tzolk%CA%BCin#cite_note-19)

In 1995, Maria von Boisse translated the mathematical matrix of the tzolkʼin to musical notes and set them into music. The final version of the work was developed in collaboration with [Hubert Bognermayr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_Bognermayr "Hubert Bognermayr") in the _Electronic Försterhaus_ in [Linz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linz "Linz"), [Austria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria "Austria").[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tzolk%CA%BCin#cite_note-20)

In 1998, composer [Michael John Wiley](http://www.michaeljohnwiley.com/) discovered mathematical and aesthetic correlations between the tzolk'in [vigesimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigesimal "Vigesimal") count and the naturally occurring [overtone series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtone_series "Overtone series") found in music, yielding the composition [Tzolkin in C Major"](https://www.michaeljohnwiley.com/tzolkin-score), which was premiered by the [Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Philharmonic_Orchestra "Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra") in Japan, 2002, taking 3rd Prize at the prestigious [Toru Takemitsu Composition Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toru_Takemitsu_Composition_Award "Toru Takemitsu Composition Award"), and subsequently developed into a [Tzolkin Cultural Meditation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmnmN_pk5rY), an audio/visual presentation of the 260 day calendar and timing matrix.
