[Arc welders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc_welding "Arc welding") need to protect themselves from [welding sparks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spark_(fire) "Spark (fire)"), which are heated metal particles that fly off the welding surface.

In the [physical sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_physical_science "Outline of physical science"), a **particle** (or **corpuscle** in older texts) is a small [localized](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/local "wikt:local")[object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_body "Physical body") which can be described by several [physical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_property "Physical property") or [chemical properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_property "Chemical property"), such as [volume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume "Volume"), [density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density "Density"), or [mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass "Mass").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle#cite_note-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle#cite_note-oed-2) They vary greatly in size or quantity, from [subatomic particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subatomic_particle "Subatomic particle") like the [electron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron "Electron"), to [microscopic particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopic_scale "Microscopic scale") like [atoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom "Atom") and [molecules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule "Molecule"), to [macroscopic particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroscopic_scale "Macroscopic scale") like [powders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powder_(substance) "Powder (substance)") and other [granular materials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granular_material "Granular material"). Particles can also be used to create [scientific models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_model "Scientific model") of even larger objects depending on their density, such as [humans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human "Human") moving in a crowd or [celestial bodies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_bodies "Celestial bodies") in [motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics) "Motion (physics)").

The term _particle_ is rather general in meaning, and is refined as needed by various scientific fields. Anything that is composed of particles may be referred to as being particulate.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle#cite_note-3) However, the noun _[particulate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particulates "Particulates")_ is most frequently used to refer to [pollutants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pollution "Air pollution") in the [Earth's atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth "Atmosphere of Earth"), which are a [suspension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_(chemistry) "Suspension (chemistry)") of unconnected particles, rather than a connected [particle aggregation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_aggregation "Particle aggregation").

Conceptual properties
---------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Particle&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Conceptual properties")]

[![Image 2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Gas_particle_movement.svg/250px-Gas_particle_movement.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Gas_particle_movement.svg)

Particles are often represented as dots. This figure could represent the movement of [atoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom "Atom") in a [gas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas "Gas"), [people in crowds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowd_simulation "Crowd simulation") or [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star "Star") in the [night sky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_sky "Night sky").

The concept of particles is especially useful when [modelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling "Scientific modelling")[nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature "Nature"), as the full treatment of many phenomena can be complex and also involve difficult computation.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle#cite_note-4) It can be used to make simplifying assumptions concerning the processes involved. [Francis Sears](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Sears "Francis Sears") and [Mark Zemansky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zemansky "Mark Zemansky"), in _[University Physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University\_Physics "University Physics")_, give the example of calculating the landing location and speed of a [baseball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_(ball) "Baseball (ball)") thrown in the air. They gradually strip the baseball of most of its properties, by first [idealizing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idealization_(science_philosophy) "Idealization (science philosophy)") it as a rigid smooth [sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere "Sphere"), then by neglecting [rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation "Rotation"), [buoyancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buoyancy "Buoyancy") and [friction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friction "Friction"), ultimately reducing the problem to the [ballistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistics "Ballistics") of a [classical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_physics "Classical physics")[point particle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_particle "Point particle").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle#cite_note-5) The treatment of large numbers of particles is the realm of [statistical physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_physics "Statistical physics").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle#cite_note-6)

[![Image 3](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/NGC_4414_%28NASA-med%29.jpg/330px-NGC_4414_%28NASA-med%29.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:NGC_4414_(NASA-med).jpg)

[Galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxies "Galaxies") are so large that [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stars "Stars") can be considered particles relative to them.

The term "particle" is usually applied differently to three classes of sizes. The term _[macroscopic particle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroscopic\_scale "Macroscopic scale")_, usually refers to particles much larger than [atoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom "Atom") and [molecules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule "Molecule"). These are usually [abstracted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction "Abstraction") as [point-like particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_particle "Point particle"), even though they have volumes, shapes, structures, etc. Examples of macroscopic particles would include [powder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powder_(substance) "Powder (substance)"), [dust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust "Dust"), [sand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand "Sand"), pieces of [debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debris "Debris") during a [car accident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_accident "Car accident"), or even objects as big as the [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star "Star") of a [galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy "Galaxy").[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle#cite_note-7)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle#cite_note-8)

Another type, _[microscopic particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopic\_scale "Microscopic scale")_ usually refers to particles of sizes ranging from [atoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom "Atom") to [molecules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule "Molecule"), such as [carbon dioxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide "Carbon dioxide"), [nanoparticles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanoparticle "Nanoparticle"), and [colloidal particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colloid "Colloid"). These particles are studied in [chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry "Chemistry"), as well as [atomic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_physics "Atomic physics") and [molecular physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_physics "Molecular physics").

The smallest particles are the _[subatomic particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subatomic\_particle "Subatomic particle")_, which refer to particles smaller than atoms.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle#cite_note-9) These would include particles such as the constituents of atoms – [protons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton "Proton"), [neutrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron "Neutron"), and [electrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron "Electron") – as well as other types of particles which can only be produced in [particle accelerators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_accelerator "Particle accelerator") or [cosmic rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_ray "Cosmic ray"). These particles are studied in [particle physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics "Particle physics").

Because of their extremely small size, the study of microscopic and subatomic particles falls in the realm of [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics"). They will exhibit phenomena demonstrated in the [particle in a box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_in_a_box "Particle in a box") model,[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle#cite_note-10)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle#cite_note-11) including [wave–particle duality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave%E2%80%93particle_duality "Wave–particle duality"),[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle#cite_note-12)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle#cite_note-13) and whether particles can be considered [distinct or identical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identical_particles "Identical particles")[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle#cite_note-14)[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle#cite_note-15) is an important question in many situations.

[![Image 4](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Quark_structure_proton.svg/250px-Quark_structure_proton.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Quark_structure_proton.svg)

A [proton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton "Proton") is composed of three [quarks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark "Quark") and held together with the [strong interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_interaction "Strong interaction").

Particles can also be classified according to composition. _[Composite particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite\_particle "Composite particle")_ refer to particles that have [composition](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/composition "wikt:composition") – that is particles which are made of other particles.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle#cite_note-16) For example, a [carbon-14](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon-14 "Carbon-14") atom is made of six protons, eight neutrons, and six electrons. By contrast, _[elementary particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary\_particle "Elementary particle")_ (also called _fundamental particles_) refer to particles that are not made of other particles.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle#cite_note-17) According to our [current understanding of the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model "Standard Model"), only a very small number of these exist, such as [leptons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lepton "Lepton"), [quarks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark "Quark"), and [gluons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluon "Gluon"). However it is possible that some of these [might be composite particles after all](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preon "Preon"), and merely appear to be elementary to scientists now.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle#cite_note-18) While composite particles can very often be considered [_point-like_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_particle "Point particle"), although having internal structure, elementary particles have so far been found to have no structure.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle#cite_note-19)

Both elementary (such as [muons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muon "Muon")) and composite particles (such as [uranium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium "Uranium")[nuclei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_nucleus "Atomic nucleus")), are known to undergo [particle decay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_decay "Particle decay"). Those that do not are called stable particles, such as the [electron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron "Electron") or a [helium-4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium-4 "Helium-4")[nucleus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_nucleus "Atomic nucleus"). The [lifetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_lifetime "Mean lifetime") of stable particles can be either [infinite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity "Infinity") or large enough to hinder attempts to observe such decays. In the latter case, those particles are called "[observationally stable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observationally_stable "Observationally stable")". In general, a particle decays from a high-[energy state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_state "Energy state") to a lower-energy state by emitting some form of [radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation "Radiation"), such as the emission of [photons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon "Photon").

In [computational physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_physics "Computational physics"), [_N_-body simulations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-body_simulation "N-body simulation") (also called _N_-particle simulations) are simulations of [dynamical systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system "Dynamical system") of particles under the influence of certain conditions, such as being subject to [gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitation "Gravitation").[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle#cite_note-Graps-20) These simulations are common in [cosmology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology "Cosmology") and [computational fluid dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_fluid_dynamics "Computational fluid dynamics").

_N_ refers to the [number of particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_number "Particle number") considered. As simulations with higher _N_ are more computationally intensive, systems with large numbers of actual particles will often be approximated to a smaller number of particles, and simulation algorithms need to be [optimized through various methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-body_simulation#Calculation_optimizations "N-body simulation").[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle#cite_note-Graps-20)

Distribution of particles
-------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Particle&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Distribution of particles")]

[![Image 5](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/ColloidalStability.png/500px-ColloidalStability.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:ColloidalStability.png)

Examples of a stable and of an unstable colloidal dispersion.

Colloidal particles are the components of a colloid. A colloid is a substance microscopically dispersed evenly throughout another substance.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle#cite_note-21) Such colloidal system can be [solid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid "Solid"), [liquid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid "Liquid"), or [gaseous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas "Gas"); as well as continuous or dispersed. The dispersed-phase particles have a diameter of between approximately 5 and 200 [nanometers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanometre "Nanometre").[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle#cite_note-22) Soluble particles smaller than this will form a solution as opposed to a colloid. Colloidal systems (also called colloidal solutions or colloidal suspensions) are the subject of [interface and colloid science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_and_colloid_science "Interface and colloid science"). [Suspended solids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspended_solids "Suspended solids") may be held in a liquid, while solid or liquid particles suspended in a gas together form an [aerosol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerosol "Aerosol"). Particles may also be suspended in the form of [atmospheric particulate matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_particulate_matter "Atmospheric particulate matter"), which may constitute [air pollution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pollution "Air pollution"). Larger particles can similarly form [marine debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_debris "Marine debris") or [space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris "Space debris"). A conglomeration of discrete solid, macroscopic particles may be described as a [granular material](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granular_material "Granular material").
