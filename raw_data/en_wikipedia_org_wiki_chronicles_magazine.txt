[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Its full current name is Chronicles: A Magazine of American Culture . It was founded in 1977 by the Rockford Institute . Today, the journal is published by the successor organization Charlemagne Institute. Since 2021, Paul Gottfried is the editor-in-chief.

[ 5 ] Chronicles has had close ties to the neo-Confederate movement.

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) said in 2017 that Chronicles "caters to the more intellectual wing of the white nationalist movement".

[ 8 ] History [ edit ] In the first years since inception in 1977, the magazine was an anticommunist bi-monthly called Chronicles of Culture , edited by Leopold Tyrmand (1920–85), pen name of Jan Andrzej Stanislaw Kowalski, a Polish novelist and co-founder of the Rockford Institute who had previously written for The New Yorker .

[ 9 ] In its first decade, the magazine grew to some 5,000 subscribers, according to E. Christian Kopff .

[ 10 ] The magazine became a monthly publication in 1982. In 1984, Thomas Fleming joined as managing editor. Fleming, who had been a co-founder of Southern Partisan magazine, brought neo-Confederate views to Chronicles .

[ 6 ] By 1989 the subscription list had grown to nearly 15,000. Fleming published right-wing authors like Sam Francis , Clyde N. Wilson , Paul Gottfried , and Chilton Williamson Jr.

As the Soviet Union broke up at the end of the Cold War and nationalism rose there and in Eastern Europe , some articles in Chronicles argued that the United States too would need to disintegrate by ethnicity.

[ 6 ] Chronicles "churned out regular anti-immigrant pieces, attacking Latin American and Southeast Asian immigration on the basis of race, culture, national identity and populist defense of the white working class", according to Joseph Lowndes.

[ 11 ] The magazine’s political influence reached its zenith in 1992 when prominent conservative journalist and politician Patrick J. Buchanan ran for president. His failed candidacies in 1996 and 2000 paralleled Chronicles ’ drop in subscribers in the 1990s from nearly 15,000 to about 6,000.

Joseph Scotchie, who has written for Chronicles , described it in 1999 as emphasizing anti-intervention in foreign policy, anti-globalism, and aversion to mass immigration.

[ 12 ] In 2000, James Warren of The Chicago Tribune called Chronicles "right-leaning" and wrote, "There are few publications more cerebral". He described a Chronicles article criticizing the finances of Donald Trump , who was then considering a Reform Party presidential campaign.

[ 13 ] Historians in the 2000s described writers associated with Chronicles as "Neo-Agrarian conservatives" [ 1 ] revering Southern beliefs.

[ 14 ] In the 2000s, the magazine ran into severe financial difficulties. According to its own account, it received a large donation of “several million dollars” by Hannelore Schwindt, a native German who had married a Texan, in her will in 2008.

[ 15 ] The executive editor at the time was Aaron D. Wolf, who died in 2019.

[ 15 ] The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) described Chronicles in 2017 as "a publication with strong neo-Confederate ties that caters to the more intellectual wing of the white nationalist movement", [ 8 ] and in another article said it was "controversial even among conservatives for its racism and anti-Semitism".

[ 16 ] Srđa Trifković is a longstanding editor for foreign affairs.

[ 17 ] In 2021, Gottfried was appointed as Interim-Editor and he has stayed in this position until today.
