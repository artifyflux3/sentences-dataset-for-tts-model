The journal began in 1831 and was split into two series in 1905: [ 1 ] Series A : for papers in physical sciences and mathematics.

Series B : for papers in life sciences.

Many landmark scientific discoveries are published in the Proceedings, making it one of the most important science journals in history. The journal contains several articles written by prominent scientists such as Paul Dirac , Werner Heisenberg , Ernest Rutherford , Erwin Schrödinger , William Lawrence Bragg , Lord Kelvin , J.J. Thomson , James Clerk Maxwell , Dorothy Hodgkin and Stephen Hawking .

In 2004, the Royal Society began The Journal of the Royal Society Interface for papers at the interface of physical sciences and life sciences.

History [ edit ] The journal began in 1831 as a compilation of abstracts of papers in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society , the older Royal Society publication, that began in 1665.

The journal has changed names several times. Initially it was called Abstracts of the Papers Communicated to the Royal Society of London . In 1854, the name became Proceedings of the Royal Society of London .

[ 2 ] In 1905, the journal rebranded and was split into Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. Series A, Containing Papers of a Mathematical and Physical Character Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Containing Papers of a Biological Character .

As of 2017 [update] , the two series are called Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences .

Proceedings of the Royal Society is now the Royal Society's main research journal, while Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society publishes articles from invited authors in themed issues.
