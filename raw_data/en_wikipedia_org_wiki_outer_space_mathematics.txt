The Outer space, denoted X n or CV n , comes equipped with a natural action of the group of outer automorphisms Out( F n ) of F n . The Outer space was introduced in a 1986 paper [ 1 ] of Marc Culler and Karen Vogtmann , and it serves as a free group analog of the Teichmüller space of a hyperbolic surface . Outer space is used to study homology and cohomology groups of Out( F n ) and to obtain information about algebraic , geometric and dynamical properties of Out( F n ), of its subgroups and individual outer automorphisms of F n . The space X n can also be thought of as the set of F n -equivariant isometry types of minimal free discrete isometric actions of F n on R -trees T such that the quotient metric graph T / F n has volume 1.

History [ edit ] The Outer space X n {\displaystyle X_{n}} was introduced in a 1986 paper [ 1 ] of Marc Culler and Karen Vogtmann , inspired by analogy with the Teichmüller space of a hyperbolic surface. They showed that the natural action of Out ⁡ ⁡ ( F n ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Out} (F_{n})} on X n {\displaystyle X_{n}} is properly discontinuous , and that X n {\displaystyle X_{n}} is contractible .

In the same paper Culler and Vogtmann constructed an embedding, via the translation length functions discussed below, of X n {\displaystyle X_{n}} into the infinite-dimensional projective space P C = R C − − { 0 } / R > 0 {\displaystyle \mathbb {P} ^{\,{\mathcal {C}}}=\mathbb {R} ^{\mathcal {C}}\!-\!\{0\}/\mathbb {R} _{>0}} , where C {\displaystyle {\mathcal {C}}} is the set of nontrivial conjugacy classes of elements of F n {\displaystyle F_{n}} . They also proved that the closure X ¯ ¯ n {\displaystyle {\overline {X}}_{n}} of X n {\displaystyle X_{n}} in P C {\displaystyle \mathbb {P} ^{\,{\mathcal {C}}}} is compact .

Later a combination of the results of Cohen and Lustig [ 2 ] and of Bestvina and Feighn [ 3 ] identified (see Section 1.3 of [ 4 ] ) the space X ¯ ¯ n {\displaystyle {\overline {X}}_{n}} with the space C V ¯ ¯ n {\displaystyle {\overline {CV}}_{n}} of projective classes of "very small" minimal isometric actions of F n {\displaystyle F_{n}} on R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } -trees .

Formal definition [ edit ] Marked metric graphs [ edit ] Let n ≥ 2. For the free group F n fix a "rose" R n , that is a wedge, of n circles wedged at a vertex v , and fix an isomorphism between F n and the fundamental group π 1 ( R n , v ) of R n . From this point on we identify F n and π 1 ( R n , v ) via this isomorphism.

A marking on F n consists of a homotopy equivalence f : R n → Γ where Γ is a finite connected graph without degree-one and degree-two vertices. Up to a (free) homotopy , f is uniquely determined by the isomorphism f # : π 1 ( R n ) → π 1 (Γ) , that is by an isomorphism F n → π 1 (Γ).

A metric graph is a finite connected graph γ γ {\displaystyle \gamma } together with the assignment to every topological edge e of Γ of a positive real number L ( e ) called the length of e .
The volume of a metric graph is the sum of the lengths of its topological edges.

A marked metric graph structure on F n consists of a marking f : R n → Γ together with a metric graph structure L on Γ.

Two marked metric graph structures f 1 : R n → Γ 1 and f 2 : R n → Γ 2 are equivalent if there exists an isometry θ : Γ 1 → Γ 2 such that, up to free homotopy, we have θ o f 1 = f 2 .

The Outer space X n consists of equivalence classes of all the volume-one marked metric graph structures on F n .

Weak topology on the Outer space [ edit ] Open simplices [ edit ] Let f : R n → Γ where Γ is a marking and let k be the number of topological edges in Γ. We order the edges of Γ as e 1 , ..., e k . Let Δ Δ k = { ( x 1 , … … , x k ) ∈ ∈ R k | ∑ ∑ i = 1 k x i = 1 , x i > 0 for i = 1 , … … , k } {\displaystyle \Delta _{k}=\left\{(x_{1},\dots ,x_{k})\in \mathbb {R} ^{k}\,{\Big |}\,\sum _{i=1}^{k}x_{i}=1,x_{i}>0{\text{ for }}i=1,\dots ,k\right\}} be the standard ( k − 1)-dimensional open simplex in R k .

Given f , there is a natural map j : Δ k → X n , where for x = ( x 1 , ..., x k ) ∈ Δ k , the point j ( x ) of X n is given by the marking f together with the metric graph structure L on Γ such that L ( e i ) = x i for i = 1, ..., k .

One can show that j is in fact an injective map, that is, distinct points of Δ k correspond to non-equivalent marked metric graph structures on F n .

The set j (Δ k ) is called open simplex in X n corresponding to f and is denoted S ( f ). By construction, X n is the union of open simplices corresponding to all markings on F n . Note that two open simplices in X n either are disjoint or coincide.

Closed simplices [ edit ] Let f : R n → Γ where Γ is a marking and let k be the number of topological edges in Γ. As before, we order the edges of Γ as e 1 , ..., e k . Define Δ k ′ ⊆ R k as the set of all x = ( x 1 , ..., x k ) ∈ R k , such that ∑ ∑ i = 1 k x i = 1 {\displaystyle \textstyle {\sum _{i=1}^{k}x_{i}=1}} , such that each x i ≥ 0 and such that the set of all edges e i in Γ Γ {\displaystyle \Gamma } with x i = 0 is a subforest in Γ.

The map j : Δ k → X n extends to a map h : Δ k ′ → X n as follows. For x in Δ k put h ( x ) = j ( x ). For x ∈ Δ k ′ − Δ k the point h ( x ) of X n is obtained by taking the marking f , contracting all edges e i of Γ Γ {\displaystyle \Gamma } with x i = 0 to obtain a new marking f 1 : R n → Γ 1 and then assigning to each surviving edge e i of Γ 1 length x i > 0.

It can be shown that for every marking f the map h : Δ k ′ → X n is still injective. The image of h is called the closed simplex in X n corresponding to f and is denoted by S ′( f ). Every point in X n belongs to only finitely many closed simplices and a point of X n represented by a marking f : R n → Γ where the graph Γ is tri-valent belongs to a unique closed simplex in X n , namely S ′( f ).

The weak topology on the Outer space X n is defined by saying that a subset C of X n is closed if and only if for every marking f : R n → Γ the set h −1 ( C ) is closed in Δ k ′. In particular, the map h : Δ k ′ → X n is a topological embedding .

Points of Outer space as actions on trees [ edit ] Let x be a point in X n given by a marking f : R n → Γ with a volume-one metric graph structure L on Γ. Let T be the universal cover of Γ. Thus T is a simply connected graph , that is T is a topological tree. We can also lift the metric structure L to T by giving every edge of T the same length as the length of its image in Γ. This turns T into a metric space ( T , d ) which is a real tree . The fundamental group π 1 (Γ) acts on T by covering transformations which are also isometries of ( T , d ), with the quotient space T / π 1 (Γ) = Γ. Since the induced homomorphism f # is an isomorphism between F n = π 1 ( R n ) and π 1 (Γ), we also obtain an isometric action of F n on T with T / F n = Γ. This action is free and discrete . Since Γ is a finite connected graph with no degree-one vertices, this action is also minimal , meaning that T has no proper F n -invariant subtrees.

Moreover, every minimal free and discrete isometric action of F n on a real tree with the quotient being a metric graph of volume one arises in this fashion from some point x of X n . This defines a bijective correspondence between X n and the set of equivalence classes of minimal free and discrete isometric actions of F n on a real trees with volume-one quotients. Here two such actions of F n on real trees T 1 and T 2 are equivalent if there exists an F n -equivariant isometry between T 1 and T 2 .

Length functions [ edit ] Give an action of F n on a real tree T as above, one can define the translation length function associate with this action: ℓ ℓ T : F n → → R , ℓ ℓ T ( g ) = min t ∈ ∈ T d ( t , g t ) , for g ∈ ∈ F n .

{\displaystyle \ell _{T}:F_{n}\to \mathbb {R} ,\quad \ell _{T}(g)=\min _{t\in T}d(t,gt),\quad {\text{ for }}g\in F_{n}.} For g ≠ 1 there is a (unique) isometrically embedded copy of R in T , called the axis of g , such that g acts on this axis by a translation of magnitude ℓ ℓ T ( g ) > 0 {\displaystyle \ell _{T}(g)>0} . For this reason ℓ ℓ T ( g ) {\displaystyle \ell _{T}(g)} is called the translation length of g . For any g , u in F n we have ℓ ℓ T ( u g u − − 1 ) = ℓ ℓ T ( g ) {\displaystyle \ell _{T}(ugu^{-1})=\ell _{T}(g)} , that is the function ℓ ℓ T {\displaystyle \ell _{T}} is constant on each conjugacy class in G .

In the marked metric graph model of Outer space translation length functions can be interpreted as follows. Let T in X n be represented by a marking f : R n → Γ with a volume-one metric graph structure L on Γ. Let g ∈ F n = π 1 ( R n ). First push g forward via f # to get a closed loop in Γ and then tighten this loop to an immersed circuit in Γ. The L -length of this circuit is the translation length ℓ ℓ T ( g ) {\displaystyle \ell _{T}(g)} of g .

A basic general fact from the theory of group actions on real trees says that a point of the Outer space is uniquely determined by its translation length function. Namely if two trees with minimal free isometric actions of F n define equal translation length functions on F n then the two trees are F n -equivariantly isometric. Hence the map T ↦ ↦ ℓ ℓ T {\displaystyle T\mapsto \ell _{T}} from X n to the set of R -valued functions on F n is injective.

One defines the length function topology or axes topology on X n as follows. For every T in X n , every finite subset K of F n and every ε > 0 let V T ( K , ϵ ϵ ) = { T ′ ∈ ∈ X n : | ℓ ℓ T ( g ) − − ℓ ℓ T ′ ( g ) | < ϵ ϵ for every g ∈ ∈ K } .

{\displaystyle V_{T}(K,\epsilon )=\{T'\in X_{n}:|\ell _{T}(g)-\ell _{T'}(g)|<\epsilon {\text{ for every }}g\in K\}.} In the length function topology for every T in X n a basis of neighborhoods of T in X n is given by the family V T ( K , ε ) where K is a finite subset of F n and where ε > 0.

Convergence of sequences in the length function topology can be characterized as follows. For T in X n and a sequence T i in X n we have lim i → → ∞ ∞ T i = T {\displaystyle \lim _{i\to \infty }T_{i}=T} if and only if for every g in F n we have lim i → → ∞ ∞ ℓ ℓ T i ( g ) = ℓ ℓ T ( g ) .

{\displaystyle \lim _{i\to \infty }\ell _{T_{i}}(g)=\ell _{T}(g).} Gromov topology [ edit ] Another topology on X n {\displaystyle X_{n}} is the so-called Gromov topology or the equivariant Gromov–Hausdorff convergence topology , which provides a version of Gromov–Hausdorff convergence adapted to the setting of an isometric group action.

When defining the Gromov topology, one should think of points of X n {\displaystyle X_{n}} as actions of F n {\displaystyle F_{n}} on R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } -trees.
Informally, given a tree T ∈ ∈ X n {\displaystyle T\in X_{n}} , another tree T ′ ∈ ∈ X n {\displaystyle T'\in X_{n}} is "close" to T {\displaystyle T} in the Gromov topology, if for some large finite subtrees of Y ⊆ ⊆ T , Y ′ ⊆ ⊆ T ′ ∈ ∈ X n {\displaystyle Y\subseteq T,Y'\subseteq T'\in X_{n}} and a large finite subset B ⊆ ⊆ F n {\displaystyle B\subseteq F_{n}} there exists an "almost isometry" between Y ′ {\displaystyle Y'} and Y {\displaystyle Y} with respect to which the (partial) actions of B {\displaystyle B} on Y ′ {\displaystyle Y'} and Y {\displaystyle Y} almost agree. For the formal definition of the Gromov topology see.

[ 5 ] Coincidence of the weak, the length function and Gromov topologies [ edit ] An important basic result states that the Gromov topology, the weak topology and the length function topology on X n coincide.

[ 6 ] Action of Out( F n ) on Outer space [ edit ] The group Out( F n ) admits a natural right action by homeomorphisms on X n .

First we define the action of the automorphism group Aut( F n ) on X n . Let α ∈ Aut( F n ) be an automorphism of F n . 
Let x be a point of X n given by a marking f : R n → Γ with a volume-one metric graph structure L on Γ. Let τ : R n → R n be a homotopy equivalence whose induced homomorphism at the fundamental group level is the automorphism α of F n = π 1 ( R n ). The element xα of X n is given by the marking f ∘ τ : R n → Γ with the metric structure L on Γ. That is, to get xα from x we simply precompose the marking defining x with τ .

In the real tree model this action can be described as follows. Let T in X n be a real tree with a minimal free and discrete co-volume-one isometric action of F n . Let α ∈ Aut( F n ). As a metric space, Tα is equal to T . The action of F n is twisted by α . Namely, for any t in T and g in F n we have: g ⋅ ⋅ T α α t = α α ( g ) ⋅ ⋅ T t .

{\displaystyle g{\underset {T\alpha }{\cdot }}t=\alpha (g){\underset {T}{\cdot }}t.} At the level of translation length functions the tree Tα is given as: ℓ ℓ T α α ( g ) = ℓ ℓ T ( α α ( g ) ) for g ∈ ∈ F n .

{\displaystyle \ell _{T\alpha }(g)=\ell _{T}(\alpha (g))\quad {\text{ for }}g\in F_{n}.} One then checks that for the above action of Aut( F n ) on Outer space X n the subgroup of inner automorphisms Inn( F n ) is contained in the kernel of this action, that is every inner automorphism acts trivially on X n . It follows that the action of Aut( F n ) on X n quotients through to an action of Out( F n ) = Aut( F n )/Inn( F n ) on X n . namely, if φ ∈ Out( F n ) is an outer automorphism of F n and if α in Aut( F n ) is an actual automorphism representing φ then for any x in X n we have xφ = xα .

The right action of Out( F n ) on X n can be turned into a left action via a standard conversion procedure. Namely, for φ ∈ Out( F n ) and x in X n set φx = xφ −1 .

This left action of Out( F n ) on X n is also sometimes considered in the literature although most sources work with the right action.

Moduli space [ edit ] The quotient space M n = X n /Out( F n ) is the moduli space which consists of isometry types of finite connected graphs Γ without degree-one and degree-two vertices, with fundamental groups isomorphic to F n (that is, with the first Betti number equal to n ) equipped with volume-one metric structures. The quotient topology on M n is the same as that given by the Gromov–Hausdorff distance between metric graphs representing points of M n . The moduli space M n is not compact and the "cusps" in M n arise from decreasing towards zero lengths of edges for homotopically nontrivial subgraphs (e.g. an essential circuit) of a metric graph Γ.

Basic properties and facts about Outer space [ edit ] Outer space X n is contractible and the action of Out( F n ) on X n is properly discontinuous , as was proved by Culler and Vogtmann in their original 1986 paper [ 1 ] where Outer space was introduced.

The space X n has topological dimension 3 n − 4. The reason is that if Γ is a finite connected graph without degree-one and degree-two vertices with fundamental group isomorphic to F n , then Γ has at most 3 n − 3 edges and it has exactly 3 n − 3 edges when Γ is trivalent. Hence the top-dimensional open simplex in X n has dimension 3 n − 4.

Outer space X n contains a specific deformation retract K n of X n , called the spine of Outer space. The spine K n has dimension 2 n − 3, is Out( F n )-invariant and has compact quotient under the action of Out( F n ).

Unprojectivized Outer space [ edit ] The unprojectivized Outer space c v n {\displaystyle cv_{n}} consists of equivalence classes of all marked metric graph structures on F n where the volume of the metric graph in the marking is allowed to be any positive real number. The space c v n {\displaystyle cv_{n}} can also be thought of as the set of all free minimal discrete isometric actions of F n on R -trees, considered up to F n -equivariant isometry. The unprojectivized Outer space inherits the same structures that X n {\displaystyle X_{n}} has, including the coincidence of the three topologies (Gromov, axes, weak), and an Out ⁡ ⁡ ( F n ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Out} (F_{n})} -action. In addition, there is a natural action of R > 0 {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} _{>0}} on c v n {\displaystyle cv_{n}} by scalar multiplication .

Topologically, c v n {\displaystyle cv_{n}} is homeomorphic to X n × × ( 0 , ∞ ∞ ) {\displaystyle X_{n}\times (0,\infty )} . In particular, c v n {\displaystyle cv_{n}} is also contractible.

Projectivized Outer space [ edit ] The projectivized Outer space is the quotient space C V n := c v n / R > 0 {\displaystyle CV_{n}:=cv_{n}/\mathbb {R} _{>0}} under the action of R > 0 {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} _{>0}} on c v n {\displaystyle cv_{n}} by scalar multiplication. The space C V n {\displaystyle CV_{n}} is equipped with the quotient topology. For a tree T ∈ ∈ c v n {\displaystyle T\in cv_{n}} its projective equivalence class is denoted [ T ] = { c T ∣ ∣ c > 0 } ⊆ ⊆ c v n {\displaystyle [T]=\{cT\mid c>0\}\subseteq cv_{n}} . The action of Out ⁡ ⁡ ( F n ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Out} (F_{n})} on c v n {\displaystyle cv_{n}} naturally quotients through to the action of Out ⁡ ⁡ ( F n ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Out} (F_{n})} on C V n {\displaystyle CV_{n}} . Namely, for ϕ ϕ ∈ ∈ Out ⁡ ⁡ ( F n ) {\displaystyle \phi \in \operatorname {Out} (F_{n})} and T ∈ ∈ c v n {\displaystyle T\in cv_{n}} put [ T ] ϕ ϕ := [ T ϕ ϕ ] {\displaystyle [T]\phi :=[T\phi ]} .

A key observation is that the map X n → → C V n , T ↦ ↦ [ T ] {\displaystyle X_{n}\to CV_{n},T\mapsto [T]} is an Out ⁡ ⁡ ( F n ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Out} (F_{n})} -equivariant homeomorphism. For this reason the spaces X n {\displaystyle X_{n}} and C V n {\displaystyle CV_{n}} are often identified.

Lipschitz distance [ edit ] The Lipschitz distance, [ 7 ] named for Rudolf Lipschitz , for Outer space corresponds to the Thurston metric in Teichmüller space. For two points x , y {\displaystyle x,y} in X n the (right) Lipschitz distance d R {\displaystyle d_{R}} is defined as the (natural) logarithm of the maximally stretched closed path from x {\displaystyle x} to y {\displaystyle y} : Λ Λ R ( x , y ) := sup γ γ ∈ ∈ F n ∖ ∖ { 1 } ℓ ℓ y ( γ γ ) ℓ ℓ x ( γ γ ) {\displaystyle \Lambda _{R}(x,y):=\sup _{\gamma \in F_{n}\setminus \{1\}}{\frac {\ell _{y}(\gamma )}{\ell _{x}(\gamma )}}} and d R ( x , y ) := log ⁡ ⁡ Λ Λ R ( x , y ) {\displaystyle d_{R}(x,y):=\log \Lambda _{R}(x,y)} This is an asymmetric metric (also sometimes called a quasimetric ), i.e. it only fails symmetry d R ( x , y ) = d R ( y , x ) {\displaystyle d_{R}(x,y)=d_{R}(y,x)} . The symmetric Lipschitz metric normally denotes: d ( x , y ) := d R ( x , y ) + d R ( y , x ) {\displaystyle d(x,y):=d_{R}(x,y)+d_{R}(y,x)} The supremum Λ Λ R ( x , y ) {\displaystyle \Lambda _{R}(x,y)} is always obtained and can be calculated by a finite set the so called candidates of x {\displaystyle x} .

Λ Λ R ( x , y ) = max γ γ ∈ ∈ cand ⁡ ⁡ ( x ) ℓ ℓ y ( γ γ ) ℓ ℓ x ( γ γ ) {\displaystyle \Lambda _{R}(x,y)=\max _{\gamma \in \operatorname {cand} (x)}{\frac {\ell _{y}(\gamma )}{\ell _{x}(\gamma )}}} A simple loop , a figure of eight , and a barbell Where cand ⁡ ⁡ ( x ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {cand} (x)} is the finite set of conjugacy classes in F n which correspond to embeddings of a simple loop , a figure of eight , or a barbell into x {\displaystyle x} via the marking (see the diagram).

The stretching factor also equals the minimal Lipschitz constant of a homotopy equivalence carrying over the marking, i.e.

Λ Λ R ( x , y ) = min h ∈ ∈ H ( x , y ) L i p ( h ) {\displaystyle \Lambda _{R}(x,y)=\min _{h\in H(x,y)}Lip(h)} Where H ( x , y ) {\displaystyle H(x,y)} are the continuous functions h : x → → y {\displaystyle h:x\to y} such that for the marking f x {\displaystyle f_{x}} on x {\displaystyle x} the marking h ∘ ∘ f x {\displaystyle h\circ f_{x}} is freely homotopic to the marking f y {\displaystyle f_{y}} on y {\displaystyle y} .

The induced topology is the same as the weak topology and the isometry group is Out ⁡ ⁡ ( F n ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Out} (F_{n})} for both, the symmetric and asymmetric Lipschitz distance.

[ 8 ] Applications and generalizations [ edit ] The closure c v ¯ ¯ n {\displaystyle {\overline {cv}}_{n}} of c v n {\displaystyle cv_{n}} in the length function topology is known to consist of ( F n -equivariant isometry classes of) all very small minimal isometric actions of F n on R -trees.

[ 9 ] Here the closure is taken in the space of all minimal isometric "irreducible" actions of F n {\displaystyle F_{n}} on R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } -trees, considered up to equivariant isometry. It is known that the Gromov topology and the axes topology on the space of irreducible actions coincide, [ 5 ] so the closure can be understood in either sense. The projectivization of c v ¯ ¯ n {\displaystyle {\overline {cv}}_{n}} with respect to multiplication by positive scalars gives the space C V ¯ ¯ n {\displaystyle {\overline {CV}}_{n}} which is the length function compactification of C V n {\displaystyle CV_{n}} and of X n {\displaystyle X_{n}} , analogous to Thurston's compactification of the Teichmüller space.

Analogs and generalizations of the Outer space have been developed for free products , [ 10 ] for right-angled Artin groups , [ 11 ] for the so-called deformation spaces of group actions [ 6 ] and in some other contexts.

A base-pointed version of Outer space, called Auter space , for marked metric graphs with base-points, was constructed by Hatcher and Vogtmann in 1998.

[ 12 ] The Auter space A n {\displaystyle A_{n}} shares many properties in common with the Outer space, but A n {\displaystyle A_{n}} only comes with an action of Aut ⁡ ⁡ ( F n ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Aut} (F_{n})} .
