It is in north-central Switzerland, [ 5 ] at the northwestern tip of Lake Zurich . As of December 2024 [update] , the municipality had 448,664 inhabitants.

[ 6 ] The urban area was home to 1.45 million people (2020), while the Zurich metropolitan area had a total population of 2.1 million (2020).

[ 7 ] Zurich is a hub for railways, roads, and air traffic. Both Zurich Airport and Zurich's main railway station are the largest and busiest in the country.

Evidence of early, sparse settlements in the area dates back more than 6,400 years, indicating human presence prior to the establishment of the town.

[ 8 ] Permanently settled for over 2,000 years, Zurich was eventually founded by the Romans , who called it Turicum . During the Middle Ages, Zurich gained the independent and privileged status of imperial immediacy and, in 1519, became a primary centre of the Protestant Reformation in Europe under the leadership of Huldrych Zwingli .

[ 9 ] The official language of Zurich is German, [ a ] but the main spoken language is Zurich German , the local variant of the Alemannic Swiss German dialect.

As one of Switzerland's primary financial centres, Zurich is home to many financial institutions and banking companies.

[ 10 ] Many museums and art galleries can be found in the city, including the Swiss National Museum , Natural History Museum and Kunsthaus .

Schauspielhaus Zürich is generally considered to be one of the most important theatres in the German-speaking world.

[ 11 ] Name [ edit ] The name is traditionally written in English as Zurich , without the umlaut . It is pronounced / ˈ zj ʊər ɪ k / ⓘ ZURE -ik .

[ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] In German, the city name is written Zürich and pronounced [ˈtsyːrɪç] ⓘ . In the local dialect , the name is pronounced without the final consonant and with two short vowels, as Züri [ˈtsyri] , although the demonym remains Zürcher(in) . The city is called Zurich [zyʁik] in French, Zurigo [dzuˈriːɡo] in Italian, and Turitg [tuˈritɕ] ⓘ in Romansh .

The earliest known form of the city's name is Turicum , attested on a tombstone of the late 2nd century AD in the form STA(tio) TURICEN(sis) ("Turicum customs post"). The name is interpreted as a derivation from a given name, possibly the Gaulish personal name Tūros . The toponym * Turīcon would then mean "belonging to Tūros", "place of Tūros".

[ 15 ] The Latin stress on the long vowel of the Gaulish name, [tʊˈriːkõː] , was lost in German [ˈtsyːrɪç] but is preserved in Italian [dzuˈriːɡo] and in Romansh [tuˈritɕ] .

The first development towards its later Germanic form is attested as early as c.

680–700 with the form Ziurichi .

[ 16 ] From the 9th century onward, the name is established in an Old High German form Zuri(c)h (857 in villa Zurih , 924 in Zurich curtem , 1416 Zürich Stadt ).

[ 17 ] In Neo-Latin texts dating from c.

1500–1800, Zurich is often referred to as Tigurum (see Tigurini ) .

P(rae)P(ositus) STA(tionis) TVRICEN(sis): "head of Zurich customs post" (detail from a Roman tombstone, c.

AD 185–200, discovered in 1747) MON(eta) NOV(a) THVRICENSIS CIVIT(atis) IMPERIALIS: "new coin of Zurich, imperial city", 1512 (with Zurich's patron saints Felix, Regula and Exuperantius ) Tigurum instead of Turicum : Zurich's Neo-Latin name had been invented by scholars of the early 16th century; see Tigurini (½ thaler from 1721) History [ edit ] Main article: History of Zurich For a chronological guide, see Timeline of Zurich .

Early history [ edit ] Johann Balthasar Bullinger 's imagining of Zurich in Roman times (engraving 1773) Settlements of the Neolithic and Bronze Age were found around Lake Zurich . Traces of pre-Roman Celtic La Tène settlements were discovered near the Lindenhof , a morainic hill dominating the SE – NW waterway constituted by Lake Zurich and the river Limmat .

[ 18 ] In Roman times , during the conquest of the alpine region in 15 BC, the Romans built a castellum on the Lindenhof.

[ 18 ] Later here was erected Turicum (a toponym of clear Celtic origin), a tax-collecting point for goods trafficked on the Limmat, which constituted part of the border between Gallia Belgica (from AD 90 Germania Superior ) and Raetia : this customs point developed later into a vicus .

[ 18 ] After Emperor Constantine 's reforms in AD 318, the border between Gaul and Italy (two of the four praetorian prefectures of the Roman Empire) was located east of Turicum, crossing the river Linth between Lake Walen and Lake Zurich where a castle and garrison looked over Turicum's safety. The earliest written record of the town dates from the 2nd century, with a tombstone referring to it as the Statio Turicensis Quadragesima Galliarum ("Zurich post for collecting the 2.5% value tax of the Galliae"), discovered at the Lindenhof .

[ 18 ] In the 5th century, the Germanic Alemanni tribe settled in the Swiss Plateau . The Roman castle remained standing until the 7th century. A Carolingian castle, built on the site of the Roman castle by the grandson of Charlemagne , Louis the German , is mentioned in 835 ( in Castro Turicino iuxta fluvium Lindemaci ). Louis also founded the Fraumünster abbey in 853 for his daughter Hildegard. He endowed the Benedictine convent with the lands of Zurich, Uri , and the Albis forest, and granted the convent immunity, placing it under his direct authority. In 1045, King Henry III granted the convent the right to hold markets, collect tolls, and mint coins, and thus effectively made the abbess the ruler of the city.

[ 19 ] Zurich gained Imperial immediacy ( Reichsunmittelbarkeit , becoming an Imperial free city ) in 1218 with the extinction of the main line of the Zähringer family and attained a status comparable to statehood. During the 1230s, a city wall was built, enclosing 38 hectares, when the earliest stone houses on the Rennweg were built as well. The Carolingian castle was used as a quarry, as it had started to fall into ruin.

[ 20 ] Emperor Frederick II promoted the abbess of the Fraumünster to the rank of a duchess in 1234. The abbess nominated the mayor, and she frequently delegated the minting of coins to citizens of the city. The political power of the convent slowly waned in the 14th century, beginning with the establishment of the Zunftordnung ( guild laws) in 1336 by Rudolf Brun , who also became the first independent mayor, i.e. not nominated by the abbess.

Manesse Codex Folio 371r An important event in the early 14th century was the completion of the Manesse Codex , a key source of medieval German poetry. The famous illuminated manuscript has been described as "the most beautifully illumined German manuscript in centuries." [ 21 ] It was commissioned by the Manesse family of Zurich, and copied and illustrated in the city at some time between 1304 and 1340. Producing such a work was a highly expensive prestige project, requiring several years of work by highly skilled scribes [ 22 ] and miniature painters, and it testifies to the increasing wealth and pride of Zurich citizens in this period. The work contains 6 songs by Süsskind von Trimberg . Von Trimberg may have been Jewish, since the work itself contains reflections on medieval Jewish life, though little is known about him.

[ 23 ] The first mention of Jews in Zurich was in 1273. Sources show that there was a synagogue in Zurich in the 13th century, implying the existence of a Jewish community.

[ 24 ] With the rise of the Black Death in 1349, Zurich, like most other Swiss cities, responded by persecuting and burning the local Jews , marking the end of the first Jewish community there. The second Jewish community of Zurich formed towards the end of the 14th century, was short-lived, and Jews were expelled and banned from the city from 1423 until the 19th century.

[ 25 ] Archaeological findings [ edit ] A woman who died in about 200 BC was found buried in a carved tree trunk during a construction project at the Kern school complex in March 2017 in Aussersihl. Archaeologists revealed that she was approximately 40 years old when she died and likely carried out little physical labor when she was alive. A sheepskin coat, a belt chain, a fancy wool dress, a scarf, and a pendant made of glass and amber beads were also discovered with the woman.

[ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] [ 29 ] Old Swiss Confederacy [ edit ] A scene depicting the Old Zurich War in 1443 (1514, illustration in Federal Chronicle by Werner Schodoler) On 1 May 1351, the citizens of Zurich had to swear allegiance before representatives of the cantons of Lucerne , Schwyz , Uri and Unterwalden , the other members of the Swiss Confederacy . Thus, Zurich became the fifth member of the Confederacy, which was at that time a loose confederation of de facto independent states . Zurich was the presiding canton of the Diet from 1468 to 1519. This authority was the executive council and lawmaking body of the confederacy, from the Middle Ages until the establishment of the Swiss federal state in 1848. Zurich was temporarily expelled from the confederacy in 1440 due to a war with the other member states over the territory of Toggenburg (the Old Zurich War ). Neither side had attained significant victory when peace was agreed upon in 1446, and Zurich was readmitted to the confederation in 1450.

[ 30 ] The Murerplan of 1576 Zwingli started the Swiss Reformation at the time when he was the main preacher at the Grossmünster in 1519. The Zurich Bible was printed by Christoph Froschauer in 1531. The Reformation resulted in major changes in state matters and civil life in Zurich, spreading also to several other cantons. Several cantons remained Catholic and became the basis of serious conflicts that eventually led to the outbreak of the Wars of Kappel .

During the 16th and 17th centuries, the Council of Zurich adopted an isolationist attitude, resulting in a second ring of imposing fortifications built in 1624. The Thirty Years' War which raged across Europe motivated the city to build these walls. The fortifications required a lot of resources, which were taken from subject territories without reaching any agreement. The following revolts were crushed brutally. In 1648, Zurich proclaimed itself a republic, shedding its former status of a free imperial city.

[ 30 ] In this time the political system of Zurich was an oligarchy ( Patriziat ): the dominant families of the city were the following ones: Bonstetten, Brun, Bürkli, Escher vom Glas, Escher vom Luchs, Hirzel, Jori (or von Jori), Kilchsperger, Landenberg, Manesse, Meiss, Meyer von Knonau, Mülner, von Orelli.

Fighting on the Paradeplatz during the Züriputsch The Helvetic Revolution of 1798 saw the fall of the Ancien Régime . Zurich lost control of the land and its economic privileges, and the city and the canton separated their possessions between 1803 and 1805. In 1839, the city had to yield to the demands of its urban subjects, following the Züriputsch of 6 September. Most of the ramparts built in the 17th century were torn down, without ever having been besieged, to allay rural concerns over the city's hegemony . The Treaty of Zurich between Austria, France, and Sardinia was signed in 1859.

[ 31 ] [ page needed ] Modern history [ edit ] Bahnhofplatz in 1902 Zurich was the Federal capital for 1839–40, and consequently, the victory of the Conservative party there in 1839 caused a great stir throughout Switzerland. But when in 1845 the Radicals regained power at Zurich, which was again the Federal capital for 1845–46, Zurich took the lead in opposing the Sonderbund cantons. Following the Sonderbund War and the formation of the Swiss Federal State, Zurich voted in favor of the Federal constitutions of 1848 and 1874. The enormous immigration from the country districts into the town from the 1830s onwards created an industrial class which, though "settled" in the town, did not possess the privileges of burghership , and consequently had no share in the municipal government. First of all in 1860 the town schools, hitherto open to "settlers" only on paying high fees, were made accessible to all, next in 1875 ten years' residence ipso facto conferred the right of burghership, and in 1893 the eleven outlying districts were incorporated within the town proper.

When Jews began to settle in Zurich following their equality in 1862, the Israelitische Cultusgemeinde Zürich was founded.

[ 32 ] Aerial view (1961) Extensive developments took place during the 19th century. From 1847, the Spanisch-Brötli-Bahn , the first railway on Swiss territory, connected Zurich with Baden , putting the Zürich Hauptbahnhof at the origin of the Swiss rail network. The present building of the Hauptbahnhof (the main railway station) dates to 1871. Zurich's Bahnhofstrasse (Station Street) was laid out in 1867, and the Zurich Stock Exchange was founded in 1877.

Industrialisation led to migration into the cities and to rapid population growth, particularly in the suburbs of Zurich.

The Quaianlagen are an important milestone in the development of the modern city of Zurich, as the construction of the new lakefront transformed Zurich from a small medieval town on the rivers Limmat and Sihl to a modern city on the Zürichsee shore, under the guidance of the city engineer Arnold Bürkli .

[ 33 ] In 1893, the twelve outlying districts were incorporated into Zurich, including Aussersihl, the workman's quarter on the left bank of the Sihl, and additional land was reclaimed from Lake Zurich.

[ 34 ] In 1934, eight additional districts in the north and west of Zurich were incorporated.

Zurich was accidentally bombed during World War II. As persecuted Jews sought refuge in Switzerland, the SIG ( Schweizerischer Israelitischer Gemeindebund , Israelite Community of Switzerland) raised financial resources. The Central Committee for Refugee Aid, created in 1933, was located in Zurich.

The canton of Zurich did not recognize the Jewish religious communities as legal entities (and therefore as equal to national churches) until 2005.

[ 32 ] Heraldic achievement [ edit ] Logo of the municipality: a modern version of the heraldic achievement The coat of arms of Zurich, used by both the city and the canton, consists of a divided field featuring white (argent) and blue (azure). Its origins date back to the 14th century, with the earliest documentation found on a seal of the Imperial Court of Justice from 1384. The shield appeared in colour on a banner in 1437 and a coin around 1417/18.

[ 35 ] When the canton of Zurich was established in 1803, it adopted the heraldic achievement that had been the city's for centuries, and a new version was created for the city by adding a mural crown as a crest . There are slight differences between the supporters of the city and the canton, too: Both have their coats of arms supported by two lions, but the lions of the canton hold a sword and a palm leaf (which belonged to the city before the canton came into existence; see pictures below).

[ 36 ] Imperial city (1557) Republic (1723) Capital of the canton of Zurich (1812) The coat of arms on the Town Hall Politics [ edit ] City districts [ edit ] Main article: Districts of Zurich Zurich's twelve municipal districts The previous boundaries of the city of Zurich (before 1893) were more or less synonymous with the location of the old town. Two large expansions of the city limits occurred in 1893 and in 1934 when the city of Zürich merged with many surrounding municipalities, that had been growing increasingly together since the 19th century. Today, the city is divided into twelve districts (known as Kreis in German), numbered 1 to 12, each one of which contains between one and four neighborhoods: Kreis 1 , known as Altstadt , contains the old town, both to the east and west of the start of the Limmat . District 1 contains the neighbourhoods of Hochschulen , Rathaus , Lindenhof , and City .

Kreis 2 lies along the west side of Lake Zurich , and contains the neighbourhoods of Enge , Wollishofen and Leimbach .

Kreis 3 , known as Wiedikon is between the Sihl and the Uetliberg , and contains the neighbourhoods of Alt-Wiedikon , Sihlfeld and Friesenberg .

Kreis 4 , known as Aussersihl lies between the Sihl and the train tracks leaving Zürich Hauptbahnhof , and contains the neighbourhoods of Werd , Langstrasse , and Hard .

Kreis 5 , known as Industriequartier , is between the Limmat and the train tracks leaving Zürich Hauptbahnhof , it contains the former industrial area of Zürich which has undergone large-scale rezoning to create upscale modern housing, retail, commercial real estate, and a few big vocational schools. It contains the neighborhoods of Gewerbeschule and Escher-Wyss .

Kreis 6 is on the edge of the Zürichberg , a hill overlooking the eastern part of the city. District 6 contains the neighbourhoods of Oberstrass and Unterstrass .

Kreis 7 is on the edge of the Adlisberg hill as well as the Zürichberg, on the eastern side of the city. District 7 contains the neighbourhoods of Fluntern , Hottingen , and Hirslanden . These neighbourhoods are home to Zurich's wealthiest and more prominent residents. The Witikon neighbourhood also belongs to district 7.

Kreis 8 , officially called Riesbach , but colloquially known as Seefeld , lies on the eastern side of Lake Zurich . District 8 consists of the neighbourhoods of Seefeld , Mühlebach , and Weinegg .

Kreis 9 is between the Limmat to the north and the Uetliberg to the south. It contains the neighbourhoods Altstetten and Albisrieden .

Kreis 10 is to the east of the Limmat and to the south of the Hönggerberg and Käferberg hills. District 10 contains the neighbourhoods of Höngg and Wipkingen .

Kreis 11 is in the area north of the Hönggerberg and Käferberg and between the Glatt Valley and the Katzensee (Cats Lake). It contains the neighbourhoods of Affoltern , Oerlikon and Seebach .

Kreis 12 , known as Schwamendingen , is in the Glattal (Glatt valley) on the northern side of the Zürichberg . District 12 contains the neighbourhoods of Saatlen , Schwamendigen Mitte , and Hirzenbach .

Most of the district boundaries are fairly similar to the original boundaries of the previously existing municipalities before they were incorporated into the city of Zurich.

Government [ edit ] See also: List of mayors of Zurich The City Council ( Stadtrat ) constitutes the executive government of the City of Zurich and operates as a collegiate authority . It is composed of nine councilors, each presiding over a department. Departmental tasks, coordination measures and implementation of laws decreed by the Municipal Council are carried out by the City Council. The regular election of the City Council by any inhabitant valid to vote is held every four years. The mayor ( German : Stadtpräsident(in) ) is elected as such by a public election by a system of Majorz while the heads of the other departments are assigned by the collegiate. Any resident of Zurich allowed to vote can be elected as a member of the City Council. In the mandate period 2022–2026 ( Legislatur ) the City Council is presided by mayor Corine Mauch . The executive body holds its meetings in the City Hall ( German : Stadthaus ), on the left bank of the Limmat. The building was built in 1883 in Renaissance style.

As of May 2023 [update] , the Zurich City Council is made up of four representatives of the SP ( Social Democratic Party , one of whom is the mayor), two members each of the Green Party and the FDP ( Free Democratic Party ), and one member of GLP ( Green Liberal Party ), giving the left parties a combined six out of nine seats.

[ 41 ] Twin towns [ edit ] Zurich is partnered with two sister cities : Kunming and San Francisco .

[ 42 ] The formal partnership agreement with the city of Kunming was established in 1982, making it Zurich's longest-standing twin town relationship. Cooperation has centred on water‑supply engineering, urban planning and cultural projects. A notable outcome of this relationship is the Chinese Garden , inaugurated in 1994 near Blatterwiese on Lake Zurich's right bank. Kunming donated the garden to express gratitude for Zurich's technical assistance with drinking water and drainage systems.

[ 43 ] The garden is considered one of the most significant temple gardens outside of China.

[ 44 ] The partnership with San Francisco was established in 2003, covering exchanges in entrepreneurship, digital innovation, urban sustainability, and public health.

[ 45 ] International initiatives [ edit ] Zurich participates in international city networks such as Eurocities and the Mayors Migration Council .

[ 46 ] In 2016 Zurich launched an outreach series that presents its economy, culture and research abroad. Editions have been held in London (2016), Hong Kong (2017), San Francisco (2018), Seoul (2019), Berlin (2022) and Copenhagen (2023).

[ 47 ] From 2017 to 2024, the municipality of Zurich partnered with Tyre, Lebanon , in a project facilitated by UN-Habitat .

[ 48 ] This collaboration aimed to support Tyre in addressing challenges related to the Syrian refugee crisis , with a focus on improving urban mobility and fostering social cohesion between host and refugee communities.

[ 48 ] The city of Zurich provided funding for this initiative.

[ 48 ] Diplomatic missions [ edit ] Zurich hosts a substantial diplomatic community, with 24 consulates‑general, 40 consulates and 1 Consular Agency in operation as of March 2025.

[ 49 ] Geography [ edit ] The Limmat in Zurich The city stretches on both sides of the Limmat , which flows out of Lake Zurich . The Alps can be seen from the city centre, background to the lake.

Zurich is situated at 408 m (1,339 ft) above sea level on the lower (northern) end of Lake Zurich ( Zürichsee ) about 30 km (19 mi) north of the Alps , nestling between the wooded hills on the west and east side. The Old Town stretches on both sides of the Limmat , which flows from the lake, running northwards at first and then gradually turning into a curve to the west. The geographic (and historic) centre of the city is the Lindenhof , a small natural hill on the west bank of the Limmat, about 700 m (2,300 ft) north of where the river issues from Lake Zurich. Today the incorporated city stretches somewhat beyond the natural confines of the hills and includes some districts to the northeast in the Glatt Valley ( Glattal ) and to the north in the Limmat Valley ( Limmattal ). The boundaries of the older city are easy to recognize by the Schanzengraben canal. This artificial watercourse has been used for the construction of the third fortress in the 17th and 18th centuries.

Topography [ edit ] The municipality of Zurich has an area of 91.88 km 2 (35.48 sq mi), of which 4.1 km 2 (1.6 sq mi) is made up of Lake Zurich. The area includes a section of the northern Swiss Plateau . The banks of the Limmat constitute the densest part of the city. The river is oriented in the southeast–northwest direction, with the flat valley floor having a width of two to three km (1.2 to 1.9 mi). The partially channeled and straightened Limmat does not flow in the central part of the valley, but always along its right (northeastern) side. The Sihl meets with the Limmat at the end of Platzspitz, which borders the Swiss National Museum . The Limmat reaches the lowest point of the municipality in Oberengstringen at 392 m (1,286 ft) above sea level .

[ citation needed ] Topographic map of Zurich and surroundings Felsenegg from Lake Zurich Zurich from Waidberg On its west side, the Limmat valley is flanked by the wooded heights of the Albis chain, which runs along the western border. The Uetliberg is, with 869 m (2,851 ft) above sea level, the highest elevation of the surrounding area. Its summit can be reached easily by the Uetlibergbahn . From the platform of the observation tower on the summit, an impressive panorama of the city, the lake, and the Alps can be seen.

[ citation needed ] The northeast side of the Limmat valley includes a range of hills, which marks the watershed between the Limmat and the Glatt. From the northwest to the southeast, the height of the mostly wooded knolls generally increases: the Gubrist (615 m or 2,018 ft), the Hönggerberg (541 m or 1,775 ft), the Käferberg (571 m or 1,873 ft), the Zürichberg (676 m or 2,218 ft), the Adlisberg (701 m or 2,300 ft) and the Öschbrig (696 m or 2,283 ft). Between the Käferberg and the Zürichberg is located the saddle of the Milchbuck (about 470 m or 1,540 ft), an important passage from the Limmat valley to the Glatt valley.

[ citation needed ] The northernmost part of the municipality extends to the plain of the Glatt valley and to the saddle which makes the connection between the Glattal and Furttal. Also, a part of the Katzensee (nature reserve) and the Büsisee, both of which are drained by the Katzenbach to Glatt, belong to the city.

[ citation needed ] Climate [ edit ] Zurich features a temperate oceanic climate ( Köppen : Cfb , Trewartha : Dobk ), with warm summers, cool winters and four distinct seasons.

[ 50 ] Decisive for the climate of Zurich are both the winds from westerly directions, which often result in precipitation and, on the other hand, the Bise (east or north-east wind), which is usually associated with high-pressure situations, but cooler weather phases with temperatures lower than the average. The Foehn wind , which plays an important role in the northern alpine valleys, also has some impact on Zurich.

[ 51 ] The annual mean temperature at the measuring station of the Federal Office of Meteorology and Climatology in Zurich-Fluntern (556 m[1,824 ft] above sea level on the slope of the Zürichberg, 150 m[490 ft] above the level of the city centre) is 9.3 °C (48.7 °F). The lowest monthly mean of daily minimum temperature are measured in January with −2.0 °C (28.4 °F) and the highest monthly mean of daily maximum temperature are measured in July with 24.0 °C (75.2 °F). On average there are 74.9 days in which the minimum temperature is below 0 °C (32 °F) (so-called frost days ), and 23.7 days in which the maximum temperature is below 0 °C (32 °F) (so-called ice days ). There are on average 30 so-called summer days (maximum temperature equal to or above 25 °C [77 °F]) throughout the year, while so-called heat days (with maximum temperature equal to or above 30 °C [86 °F]) are 5.8 days.

[ 52 ] The average high temperature in July is 24.0 °C (75.2 °F) and average low temperature is 14 °C (57.2 °F). The highest recorded temperature in Zurich was 37.7 °C (100 °F), recorded in July 1947, and typically the warmest day reaches an average of 32.2 °C (90.0 °F).

[ 53 ] [ 54 ] Spring and autumn are generally cool to mild, but sometimes with large differences between warm and cold days even during the same year. The highest temperature of the month March in 2014 was on the 20th at 20.6 °C (69.1 °F) during a sunny afternoon and the lowest temperature was on the 25th at −0.4 °C (31.3 °F) during the night/early morning.

[ 55 ] Record low of average daily temperatures in March since 1864 is −12 °C (10 °F) and record high of average daily temperatures in March is 16 °C (61 °F). Record low of average daily temperatures in October is −16 °C (3 °F) and record high of average daily temperatures in October is 20 °C (68 °F).

[ 56 ] Zurich has an average of 1,544 hours of sunshine per year and shines on 38% of its potential time throughout the year. During the months April until September the sun shines between 150 and 215 hours per month. The 1,134 mm (44.6 in) rainfall spread on 133.9 days with precipitation throughout the year. Roughly about every third day you will encounter at least some precipitation, which is very much a Swiss average. During the warmer half of the year and especially during the three summer months, the strength of rainfall is higher than those measured in winter, but the days with precipitation stays about the same throughout the year (in average 9.9–12.7 days per month). October has the lowest number (9.9) of days with some precipitation. There is an average of 59.5 so-called bright days (number of days with sunshine duration greater than 80%) through the year, the most in July and August (7.4, 7.7 days), and the least in January and December (2.7, 1.8 days). The average number of days with sunshine duration less than 20%, so-called cloudy days , is 158.4 days, while the most cloudy days are in November (17.8 days), December (21.7 days), and January with 19 days.

A comparison between the periods 1940–1950 and 2013–2024 reveals significant changes. For example, in July, temperatures have increased by 1.77°C, while December has seen a rise of 3.41°C. Precipitation in October has increased by 1.45 mm. In contrast, snowfall in February has decreased by 0.16 mm, and in March, there has been a reduction in sunshine duration by 0.56 hours.

[ 60 ] Climate protection [ edit ] In November 2008 [ 61 ] the people of Zurich voted in a public referendum to write into law the quantifiable and fixed deadline of one tonne of CO 2 per person per annum by 2050 . This forces any decision of the executive to support this goal, even if the costs are higher in all dimensions. Some examples are the new disinfection section of the public city hospital in Triemli ( Minergie-P quality – passive house ), [ clarification needed ] the continued optimisation and creation of public transportation, enlargement of the bicycle-only network, research and projects for renewable energy and enclosure of speed-ways.

[ clarification needed ] Urban area [ edit ] The areas surrounding the Limmat are almost completely developed with residential, industrial, and commercial zones. The sunny and desirable residential areas in the hills overlooking Zurich, Waidberg and Zürichberg, and the bottom part of the slope on the western side of the valley on the Uetliberg, are also densely built.

The "green lungs" of the city include the vast forest areas of Adlisberg, Zürichberg, Käferberg, Hönggerberg and Uetliberg. Major parks are also located along the lakeshore (Zürichhorn and Enge), while smaller parks dot the city. Larger contiguous agricultural lands are located near Affoltern and Seebach . Of the total area of the municipality of Zurich (in 1996, without the lake), 45.4% is residential, industrial and commercial, 15.5% is transportation infrastructure, 26.5% is forest, 11% is agriculture and 1.2% is water.

View over Zurich and Lake Zurich from the Uetliberg Transport [ edit ] Public transport [ edit ] Main article: Public transport in Zurich See also: Zurich model One of the city's two paddle steamers on Lake Zurich Zurich's main railway station , Switzerland's busiest railway station Public transport is extremely popular in Zurich, and its inhabitants use public transport in large numbers. About 70% of the visitors to the city use the tram or bus (motor or trolley ), and about half of the journeys within the municipality take place on public transport.

[ 62 ] The city's network of public transport includes four main modes of transit: trains, in particular the local S-Bahn , trams, buses, and boats . Tickets purchased for a trip are valid on each mode of transport. The public-transport network also includes three funicular railways within the city's fare zone .

Zurich is a mixed hub for railways, roads, and air traffic. Zurich's main railway station, Zürich Hauptbahnhof ( Zürich HB ), is the largest and busiest station in Switzerland and is an important railway hub in Europe . As of 2019, it served around 470,000 passengers and nearly 3,000 trains every day.

[ 63 ] In total, there are 28 operational railway stations in Zurich .

Zurich Airport [ edit ] Main article: Zurich Airport Zurich Airport in Kloten Zurich Airport is about 8 km (5.0 mi) north of central Zurich, partly lying in the municipality of Kloten . Zurich Airport has its own railway station, which is located underground. It is directly connected to Zurich and most of the major Swiss cities. Zurich Airport is served by more than 60 passenger airlines from around the world. It is also served by one cargo airline and is a hub for Swiss International Air Lines . There is also an airfield in Dübendorf .

Road traffic [ edit ] The A1 , A3 , and A4 motorways pass close to Zurich. The A1 heads west towards Bern and Geneva and eastwards towards St. Gallen ; the A4 leads northwards to Schaffhausen and southwards to Altdorf connecting with the A2 towards Chiasso ; and the A3 heads northwest towards Basel and southeast along Lake Zurich and Lake Walen towards Sargans .

Bicycle transport [ edit ] See also: Swiss National Bike Routes In 2012, the city council launched a program to improve the city's attractiveness for bicycle traffic. The so-called "Masterplan Velo" [ 64 ] is part of the superordinate framework Stadtverkehr 2025 which shapes the future of the different means of transport. Research revealed that infrastructure and the social environment are essential factors in improving a city's appeal to bicycle traffic.

[ 65 ] Three main goals are specified: First, the modal share of bicycle traffic should be enhanced to twice the value of 2011 by 2015. Second, cyclists' safety should be improved to lower the overall accident risk. Third, cycling should be established as an everyday means of transport with a special focus on children and young people.

In terms of infrastructure, the city aims to build up a network of distinctive bicycle routes in order to achieve these objectives. At a final stage, the network will consist of main routes ( Hauptrouten ) for everyday use and comfort routes ( Komfortrouten ), with the latter focusing on leisure cycling. Additional measures such as special Velostationen providing bike-related services are expected to help to further improve the quality. One of the key projects of the system is a tunnel beneath the tracks of the main railway station planned to combine a main connection with staffed possibilities where commuters can leave their bikes throughout the day.

[ 66 ] Apart from infrastructural measures, further approaches are planned in the fields of communication, education and administration.

However, these efforts cause critique, mainly due to postponing. The institution of the bike tunnel at the main railway station, originally planned for 2016, was delayed to at least 2019.

[ 67 ] Pro Velo, a nationwide interest group, has publicly questioned whether the masterplan already failed.

[ 68 ] The critique aims at badly governed traffic management at construction sites, missing possibilities to park bikes in the city as well as rather diffident ambitions. In response, the responsible city department points to the big investments made every year and mentions ongoing discussions that would finally lead to even better results.

Of registered inhabitants (in 2016), 32% (133,473) do not hold Swiss citizenship.

[ 73 ] Of these, German citizens make up the largest group with 8% (33,548), followed by Italians 3.5% (14,543).

[ 73 ] As of 2011, the population of the city, including suburbs, totaled 1.17 million people.

[ 74 ] The entire metropolitan area (including the cities of Winterthur , Baden , Brugg , Schaffhausen , Frauenfeld , Uster / Wetzikon , Rapperswil-Jona , and Zug ) had a population of around 1.82 million people.

However, because of Zurich's national importance, and therefore its existing high fluctuation, [ clarification needed ] its inhabitants and commuters speak all kinds of Swiss German dialects. As of the December 2010 census, 69.3% of the population speaks diglossic Swiss German / Swiss Standard German as their mother-tongue at home. Some 22.7% of inhabitants speak Standard German in their family environment ("at home"). Dramatically increasing, according to the last census in 2000, 8.8% now speak English. Italian follows behind at 7.1% of the population, then French at 4.5%. Other languages spoken here include: Bosnian (4.1%), Spanish (3.9%), Portuguese (3.1%), and Albanian (2.3%). (Multiple choices were possible.) Thus, 20% of the population speak two or more languages at home.

The Protestant Reformation , led by Huldrych Zwingli , made Zurich both a theological centre and a stronghold of Protestantism in Switzerland . Another Swiss city with a comparable status was Geneva , the so-called Protestant Rome , where John Calvin and his Protestant Reformers operated, as well as Basel . Zurich attracted other influential Protestant Reformers like Heinrich Bullinger . Zwingli translated the Bible ( Zurich Bible ) into the local variety of German, and introduced the Reformation by winning support of the magistrates, the princess abbess Katharina von Zimmern , and the largely peasant population of the Canton of Zurich . The canton unanimously adopted the Reformed tradition , as represented by Zwingli. Religious wars between Catholics and Protestants tormented the Swiss Confederacy . Zwingli died for political and religious reasons by defending the Canton of Zurich in the Battle of Kappel . Bullinger took over his role as the city's spiritual leader.

In 1970, about 53% of the population were Swiss Reformed , while almost 40% were Roman Catholic. Since then, both large Swiss churches, the Roman Catholic Church and Swiss Reformed Church, have been constantly losing members, though for the Catholic Church, the decrease started 20 years later, in around 1990. Nevertheless, for the last twenty years, both confessions have been reduced by 10%, to the current figures (census 2010): 30% Roman Catholic, and 26% Swiss Reformed (organized in Evangelical Reformed Church of the Canton of Zurich ). In 1970, only 2% of Zurich's inhabitants claimed to be not affiliated with any religious confession. In accordance with the loss by the large Swiss churches, the number of people declaring themselves as non-affiliated rose to 17% in the year 2000. In the last ten years, this figure rose to more than 25%. For the group of people, being between 24 and 44 years old, this is as high as one in every third person.

[ 77 ] 5% of Zurich's inhabitants are Muslims , a slight decrease of 1%, compared to the year 2000. The Mahmood Mosque Zurich , situated in Forchstrasse, is the first mosque built in Switzerland.

[ 77 ] [ 78 ] The population of Jewish ethnicity and religion has been more or less constant since 1970, at about 1%. The Synagoge Zürich Löwenstrasse is the oldest and largest synagogue of Zurich.

[ 77 ] [ 79 ] Social [ edit ] The level of unemployment in Zurich was 3.2% [ 80 ] in July 2012. In 2008, the average monthly income was about CHF 7000 before any deductions for social insurances and taxes.

[ 81 ] In 2010, there were 12,994 cases (on average per month) of direct or indirect welfare payments from the state.

[ 82 ] Quality of living [ edit ] Zurich often performs very well in international rankings , some of which are mentioned below: Monocle's 2012 "Quality of Life Survey" ranked Zurich first on a list of the top 25 cities in the world "to make a base within".

[ 83 ] In 2019 Zurich was ranked among the ten most liveable cities in the world by Mercer together with Geneva and Basel .

[ 84 ] In fDi Magazine ' s "Global Cities of the Future 2021/22" report, Zurich placed 16th in the overall rankings (all categories).

[ 85 ] [ 86 ] In the category "Mid-sized and small cities", Zurich was 2nd overall, behind Wrocław , having also placed 2nd in the subcategory "Human capital and lifestyle" and 3rd under "Business friendliness". In the category "FDI strategy, overall" (relating to foreign direct investment), Zurich ranked 9th, behind such cities as New York, Montreal (1st and 2nd) and Dubai (at number 8).

[ 86 ] Main sites [ edit ] Further information: Altstadt (Zurich) Bahnhofstrasse, looking north from Paradeplatz Most of Zurich's sites are located within the area on either side of the Limmat, between the main railway station and Lake Zurich . The churches and houses of the old town are clustered here, as are the most expensive shops along the famous Bahnhofstrasse. The Lindenhof in the old town is the historical site of the Roman castle, and the later Carolingian Imperial Palace .

It was converted in the first half of the 14th century, and the choir rebuilt between 1308 and 1350. Due to its construction and for that time unusual high bell tower, it was regarded as the most high Gothic edifice in Zurich.

In the adjacent high-rise areas II and III the height is limited to 40 m (130 ft). Around the year 2000, regulations became more flexible and high-rise buildings were again planned and built. The people's initiative "40 m (130 ft) is enough," which would have reduced both the maximum height and the high-rise buildings area, was clearly rejected on 29 November 2009.
