It should not be confused [ 2 ] [ 3 ] with the CGHS model or Liouville gravity . The action is given by S = 1 κ κ ∫ ∫ d 2 x − − g Φ Φ ( R − − Λ Λ ) {\displaystyle S={\frac {1}{\kappa }}\int d^{2}x\,{\sqrt {-g}}\,\Phi \left(R-\Lambda \right)} The metric in this case is more amenable to analytical solutions than the general 3+1D case though a canonical reduction for the latter has recently been obtained.

[ 4 ] For example, in 1+1D, the metric for the case of two mutually interacting bodies can be solved exactly in terms of the Lambert W function , even with an additional electromagnetic field.

Varying with respect to Φ yields R = Λ Λ {\displaystyle R=\Lambda } on shell, which means the metric is either Anti-de Sitter space or De Sitter space , depending upon the sign of Λ.
