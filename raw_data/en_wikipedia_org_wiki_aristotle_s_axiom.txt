Note that: 1) the line AB does not need to intersect OY or OX; 2) P and Q do not need to lie on the lines OY and OX, but their rays (i.e. the infinite continuation of these lines).

Aristotle's axiom is an axiom in the foundations of geometry , proposed by Aristotle in On the Heavens that states: If X O Y ^ ^ {\displaystyle {\widehat {\rm {XOY}}}} is an acute angle and AB is any segment, then there exists a point P on the ray O Y → → {\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {OY}}} and a point Q on the ray O X → → {\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {OX}}} , such that PQ is perpendicular to OX and PQ > AB.

Aristotle's axiom  is a consequence of the Archimedean property , [ 1 ] and the conjunction of Aristotle's axiom and the Lotschnittaxiom , which states that "Perpendiculars raised on each side of a right angle intersect", is equivalent to the Parallel Postulate .

[ 2 ] Without the parallel postulate, Aristotle's axiom is equivalent to each of the following two incidence-geometric statements: [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Given two intersecting lines m and n, and a  point P, incident with neither m nor n,  there exists a line g  through P which intersects m but not n.

Given a line a as well as two intersecting lines m and n, both parallel to a, there exists a line g which intersects a and m, but not n.
