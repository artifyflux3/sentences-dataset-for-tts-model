LQGs are thought to be precursors to the sheets, walls and filaments of galaxies found in the relatively nearby universe.

[ 1 ] Prominent LQGs [ edit ] On January 11, 2013, the discovery of the Huge-LQG was announced by the University of Central Lancashire , as the largest known structure in the universe by that time. It is composed of 74 quasars and has a minimum diameter of 1.4 billion light-years , but over 4 billion light-years at its widest point.

[ 2 ] According to researcher and author, Roger Clowes, the existence of structures with the size of LQGs was believed theoretically impossible.  Cosmological structures had been believed to have a size limit of approximately 1.2 billion light-years.

( July 2023 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) An artist's impression of a single quasar powered by a black hole with a mass two billion times that of the Sun Redshift, represented by "z," is a fundamental concept in astrophysics. It measures how much the light from celestial objects shift as they move away from Earth. A higher redshift value means the object is farther away in the universe.
