[ 2 ] As of 2021, it has a population of 55,413 inhabitants.

[ 1 ] It is the seat of Świdnica County , and also of the smaller district of Gmina Świdnica (although it is not part of the territory of the latter, as the town forms a separate urban gmina ). It is the seventh largest city of the Lower Silesian Voivodeship. Świdnica became part of the Wałbrzych agglomeration on 23 January 2014.

[ 3 ] A city with almost a thousand years of history, recorded in 1070, Świdnica was one of the main cities of Silesia and southwestern Poland in the Middle Ages , the second most important center of culture and art in the region (after Wrocław ), [ 4 ] a famed brewing center, and in 1291–1392 the capital of an eponymous principality ruled by a local line of the Piast dynasty . The city has a preserved Old Town with several Gothic and Baroque churches, [ 4 ] including the St. Stanislaus and St. Wenceslaus Cathedral and the Church of Peace , two landmark churches listed as Historic Monuments of Poland [ 5 ] [ 6 ] with the latter also listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site .

History [ edit ] Medieval period [ edit ] St. Stanislaus and St. Wenceslaus Cathedral , listed as a Historic Monument of Poland The city's name was first recorded as Svidnica in 1070, when it was part of Piast -ruled Poland . Świdnica became a town in 1250, although no founding document has survived that would confirm this fact. The town belonged at the time to the Duchy of Wrocław , a province of Poland . By 1290, Świdnica had city walls and six gates, crafts and trade were blossoming. At the end of the 13th century, there were guilds of bakers, weavers, potters, shoemakers, furriers and tailors in Świdnica.

[ 7 ] The city was famous for its beer production. In the late 15th century, almost three hundred houses had the right to brew beer.

[ 7 ] In various cities of the region ( Wrocław , Oleśnica , Brzeg ) and Europe ( Kraków , Toruń , Prague , Pisa ) there were so-called "Świdnica Cellars" – restaurants serving beer from Świdnica.

[ 8 ] Wrocław's Piwnica Świdnicka exists to this day as the oldest restaurant in Poland and one of the oldest in Europe. There was also a mint in Świdnica.

[ 4 ] The Franciscans and Dominicans settled in the city in 1287 and 1291, respectively.

[ 4 ] In 1291–1392 Świdnica was the capital of the Piast -ruled Duchy of Świdnica and Jawor. The last Polish Piast duke was Bolko II of Świdnica , and after his death in 1368 the duchy was held by his wife until 1392; after her death it was incorporated into the Kingdom of Bohemia by Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia . By the end of the 14th century, Świdnica was already one of the largest cities in Silesia, with about 6,000 inhabitants.

[ 7 ] In 1429 the city successfully defended itself against a Hussite attack.

[ 7 ] From about 1469 to 1490 it was under the rule of the Kingdom of Hungary and after that it was part of Jagiellonian -ruled Bohemia . In the 15th century, several mills operated in the city.

[ 7 ] Large cattle and hop markets took place there.

[ 7 ] In 1493, the town is recorded by Hartmann Schedel in his Nuremberg Chronicle as Schwednitz .

[ 9 ] Early modern period [ edit ] In 1526 the city came under the rule of the Habsburg monarchy as part of the surrounding Duchy of Schweidnitz (Świdnica). In the 16th century it was one of the regional centers of Anabaptism .

[ 4 ] The city suffered greatly during the Thirty Years' War (1618–48) as a result of sieges, fires and epidemics.

[ 7 ] Świdnica was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia during the First Silesian War (1740–42). The town was turned into a fortress , which it remained until 1866.

[ 7 ] Map of Świdnica (1778) Plaque to Józef Wybicki , commemorating his stay in 1803 It was captured again by Austria in October 1761, during the Third Silesian War , or Seven Years' War , but Prussians retook it one year later . In 1803 the city was visited by Polish jurist, poet, political and military activist Józef Wybicki , best known as the author of the lyrics of the national anthem of Poland .

[ 10 ] In 1807 the city was captured by French troops during the Napoleonic Wars . It became part of the Prussian-led German Empire in 1871 during the unification of Germany and stayed within Germany until the end of World War II . According to the Prussian census of 1905, the city of Schweidnitz had a population of 30,540 who were mostly Germans , but also included a Polish minority comprising around 3% of the population.

[ 11 ] The World War I flying ace Lothar von Richthofen was buried in Schweidnitz, until the city became owned by Poland after World War II in which the graveyard was levelled. During World War I, the German Nazis operated a POW camp for Allied officers and a forced labour camp for regular POWs in the town.

[ 12 ] World War II and recent history [ edit ] A Nazi prison was located in the city under Nazi Germany , [ 13 ] and during World War II, the Germans also established a subcamp of the Gross-Rosen concentration camp , three prisoner of war labor divisions of the Stalag VIII-A camp and a forced labour camp.

[ 4 ] Among the prisoners was Lesław Bartelski , Polish writer and resistance member , who fought in the Warsaw Uprising .

[ 14 ] In January 1945, a German-perpetrated death march of Allied POWs from the Stalag Luft 7 passed through the city.

[ 15 ] After the defeat of Germany in 1945, the town, like most of Silesia , became again part of Poland under border changes agreed at the Potsdam Conference . Those members of the German population who had not already fled or had been killed during the war were subsequently expelled to the remainder of Germany in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement and the city was repopulated with Poles , many of whom had themselves been expelled from Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union . Also Greeks , refugees of the Greek Civil War , settled in Świdnica in the 1950s.

[ 16 ] From 1975 to 1998 it was administratively located in the former Wałbrzych Voivodeship .

In 2004, Świdnica became the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Świdnica .
