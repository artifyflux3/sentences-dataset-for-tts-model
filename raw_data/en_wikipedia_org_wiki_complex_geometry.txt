In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), **complex geometry** is the study of [geometric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry") structures and constructions arising out of, or described by, the [complex numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number "Complex number"). In particular, complex geometry is concerned with the study of [spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(mathematics) "Space (mathematics)") such as [complex manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_manifold "Complex manifold") and [complex algebraic varieties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_algebraic_variety "Complex algebraic variety"), functions of [several complex variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Several_complex_variables "Several complex variables"), and holomorphic constructions such as [holomorphic vector bundles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holomorphic_vector_bundles "Holomorphic vector bundles") and [coherent sheaves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherent_sheaf "Coherent sheaf"). Application of transcendental methods to [algebraic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry "Algebraic geometry") falls in this category, together with more geometric aspects of [complex analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_analysis "Complex analysis").

Complex geometry sits at the intersection of algebraic geometry, [differential geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry "Differential geometry"), and complex analysis, and uses tools from all three areas. Because of the blend of techniques and ideas from various areas, problems in complex geometry are often more tractable or concrete than in general. For example, the classification of complex manifolds and complex algebraic varieties through the [minimal model program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_model_program "Minimal model program") and the construction of [moduli spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moduli_space "Moduli space") sets the field apart from differential geometry, where the classification of possible [smooth manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_manifold "Smooth manifold") is a significantly harder problem. Additionally, the extra structure of complex geometry allows, especially in the [compact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space "Compact space") setting, for [global analytic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_analysis "Global analysis") results to be proven with great success, including [Shing-Tung Yau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shing-Tung_Yau "Shing-Tung Yau")'s proof of the [Calabi conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calabi_conjecture "Calabi conjecture"), the [Hitchin–Kobayashi correspondence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitchin%E2%80%93Kobayashi_correspondence "Hitchin–Kobayashi correspondence"), the [nonabelian Hodge correspondence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonabelian_Hodge_correspondence "Nonabelian Hodge correspondence"), and existence results for [Kähler–Einstein metrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%A4hler%E2%80%93Einstein_metric "Kähler–Einstein metric") and [constant scalar curvature Kähler metrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_scalar_curvature_K%C3%A4hler_metric "Constant scalar curvature Kähler metric"). These results often feed back into complex algebraic geometry, and for example recently the classification of Fano manifolds using [K-stability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-stability_of_Fano_varieties "K-stability of Fano varieties") has benefited tremendously both from techniques in analysis and in pure [birational geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birational_geometry "Birational geometry").

Complex geometry has significant applications to theoretical physics, where it is essential in understanding [conformal field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformal_field_theory "Conformal field theory"), [string theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory "String theory"), and [mirror symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_symmetry_(string_theory) "Mirror symmetry (string theory)"). It is often a source of examples in other areas of mathematics, including in [representation theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_theory "Representation theory") where [generalized flag varieties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_flag_varieties "Generalized flag varieties") may be studied using complex geometry leading to the [Borel–Weil–Bott theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borel%E2%80%93Weil%E2%80%93Bott_theorem "Borel–Weil–Bott theorem"), or in [symplectic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symplectic_geometry "Symplectic geometry"), where [Kähler manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%A4hler_manifold "Kähler manifold") are symplectic, in [Riemannian geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_geometry "Riemannian geometry") where complex manifolds provide examples of exotic metric structures such as [Calabi–Yau manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calabi%E2%80%93Yau_manifold "Calabi–Yau manifold") and [hyperkähler manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperk%C3%A4hler_manifold "Hyperkähler manifold"), and in [gauge theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_theory_(mathematics) "Gauge theory (mathematics)"), where [holomorphic vector bundles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holomorphic_vector_bundles "Holomorphic vector bundles") often admit solutions to important [differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation "Differential equation") arising out of physics such as the [Yang–Mills equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang%E2%80%93Mills_equations "Yang–Mills equations"). Complex geometry additionally is impactful in pure algebraic geometry, where analytic results in the complex setting such as [Hodge theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodge_theory "Hodge theory") of Kähler manifolds inspire understanding of [Hodge structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodge_structure "Hodge structure") for [varieties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_variety "Algebraic variety") and [schemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(algebraic_geometry) "Scheme (algebraic geometry)") as well as [p-adic Hodge theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-adic_Hodge_theory "P-adic Hodge theory"), [deformation theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformation_theory "Deformation theory") for complex manifolds inspires understanding of the deformation theory of schemes, and results about the [cohomology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohomology "Cohomology") of complex manifolds inspired the formulation of the [Weil conjectures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weil_conjectures "Weil conjectures") and [Grothendieck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grothendieck "Grothendieck")'s [standard conjectures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_conjectures "Standard conjectures"). On the other hand, results and techniques from many of these fields often feed back into complex geometry, and for example developments in the mathematics of string theory and mirror symmetry have revealed much about the nature of [Calabi–Yau manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calabi%E2%80%93Yau_manifold "Calabi–Yau manifold"), which string theorists predict should have the structure of Lagrangian fibrations through the [SYZ conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SYZ_conjecture "SYZ conjecture"), and the development of [Gromov–Witten theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gromov%E2%80%93Witten_theory "Gromov–Witten theory") of [symplectic manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symplectic_manifold "Symplectic manifold") has led to advances in [enumerative geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enumerative_geometry "Enumerative geometry") of complex varieties.

The [Hodge conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodge_conjecture "Hodge conjecture"), one of the [millennium prize problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_prize_problems "Millennium prize problems"), is a problem in complex geometry.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_geometry#cite_note-1)

[![Image 1](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/RiemannKugel.svg/250px-RiemannKugel.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:RiemannKugel.svg)

A typical example of a complex space is the [complex projective line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_projective_line "Complex projective line"). It may be viewed either as the [sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere "Sphere"), a smooth manifold arising from [differential geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry "Differential geometry"), or the [Riemann sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_sphere "Riemann sphere"), an extension of the complex plane by adding a [point at infinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_at_infinity "Point at infinity").

Broadly, complex geometry is concerned with [spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(mathematics) "Space (mathematics)") and [geometric objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry") which are modelled, in some sense, on the [complex plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_plane "Complex plane"). Features of the complex plane and [complex analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_analysis "Complex analysis") of a single variable, such as an intrinsic notion of [orientability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientability "Orientability") (that is, being able to consistently rotate 90 degrees counterclockwise at every point in the complex plane), and the rigidity of [holomorphic functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holomorphic_function "Holomorphic function") (that is, the existence of a single complex derivative implies complex differentiability to all orders) are seen to manifest in all forms of the study of complex geometry. As an example, every complex manifold is canonically orientable, and a form of [Liouville's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liouville%27s_theorem_(complex_analysis) "Liouville's theorem (complex analysis)") holds on [compact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space "Compact space") complex manifolds or [projective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_variety "Projective variety") complex algebraic varieties.

Complex geometry is different in flavour to what might be called _real_ geometry, the study of spaces based around the geometric and analytical properties of the [real number line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number_line "Real number line"). For example, whereas [smooth manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_manifold "Smooth manifold") admit [partitions of unity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_unity "Partition of unity"), collections of smooth functions which can be identically equal to one on some [open set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_set "Open set"), and identically zero elsewhere, complex manifolds admit no such collections of holomorphic functions. Indeed, this is the manifestation of the [identity theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_theorem "Identity theorem"), a typical result in complex analysis of a single variable. In some sense, the novelty of complex geometry may be traced back to this fundamental observation.

It is true that every complex manifold is in particular a real smooth manifold. This is because the complex plane ![Image 2: {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f9add4085095b9b6d28d045fd9c92c2c09f549a7) is, after forgetting its complex structure, isomorphic to the real plane ![Image 3: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e150115ab9f63023215109595b76686a1ff890fd). However, complex geometry is not typically seen as a particular sub-field of [differential geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry "Differential geometry"), the study of smooth manifolds. In particular, [Serre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Pierre_Serre "Jean-Pierre Serre")'s [GAGA theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry_and_analytic_geometry "Algebraic geometry and analytic geometry") says that every [projective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_variety "Projective variety")[analytic variety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_variety "Analytic variety") is actually an [algebraic variety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_variety "Algebraic variety"), and the study of holomorphic data on an analytic variety is equivalent to the study of algebraic data.

This equivalence indicates that complex geometry is in some sense closer to [algebraic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry "Algebraic geometry") than to [differential geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry "Differential geometry"). Another example of this which links back to the nature of the complex plane is that, in complex analysis of a single variable, singularities of [meromorphic functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meromorphic_functions "Meromorphic functions") are readily describable. In contrast, the possible singular behaviour of a continuous real-valued function is much more difficult to characterise. As a result of this, one can readily study [singular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singularity_(mathematics) "Singularity (mathematics)") spaces in complex geometry, such as singular complex [analytic varieties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_varieties "Analytic varieties") or singular complex algebraic varieties, whereas in differential geometry the study of singular spaces is often avoided.

In practice, complex geometry sits in the intersection of differential geometry, algebraic geometry, and [analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis "Analysis") in [several complex variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Several_complex_variables "Several complex variables"), and a complex geometer uses tools from all three fields to study complex spaces. Typical directions of interest in complex geometry involve [classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classification_theorem "Classification theorem") of complex spaces, the study of holomorphic objects attached to them (such as [holomorphic vector bundles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holomorphic_vector_bundle "Holomorphic vector bundle") and [coherent sheaves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherent_sheaves "Coherent sheaves")), and the intimate relationships between complex geometric objects and other areas of mathematics and physics.

Complex geometry is concerned with the study of [complex manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_manifold "Complex manifold"), and [complex algebraic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_algebraic_variety "Complex algebraic variety") and [complex analytic varieties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex-analytic_variety "Complex-analytic variety"). In this section, these types of spaces are defined and the relationships between them presented.

A **complex manifold** is a [topological space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space "Topological space")![Image 4: {\displaystyle X}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab) such that:

Notice that since every biholomorphism is a [diffeomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffeomorphism "Diffeomorphism"), and ![Image 5: {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} ^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a53b4e76242764d1bca004168353c380fef25258) is isomorphism as a [real vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_vector_space "Real vector space") to ![Image 6: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{2n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/47460f1a92774729807be11cf62b9178b5771b4a), every complex manifold of dimension ![Image 7: {\displaystyle n}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b) is in particular a smooth manifold of dimension ![Image 8: {\displaystyle 2n}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/134afa8ff09fdddd24b06f289e92e3a045092bd1), which is always an even number.

In contrast to complex manifolds which are always smooth, complex geometry is also concerned with possibly singular spaces. An **affine complex analytic variety** is a subset ![Image 9: {\displaystyle X\subseteq \mathbb {C} ^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ad8cce1308d7c6f0c30e2af3d62400a2ba2e386f) such that about each point ![Image 10: {\displaystyle p\in X}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fae5d7ae3f7710fc989d0bd6dca038d74107f16d), there is an open neighbourhood ![Image 11: {\displaystyle U}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/458a728f53b9a0274f059cd695e067c430956025) of ![Image 12: {\displaystyle p}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/81eac1e205430d1f40810df36a0edffdc367af36) and a collection of finitely many holomorphic functions ![Image 13: {\displaystyle f_{1},\dots ,f_{k}:U\to \mathbb {C} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/40c75ed6da35e2154ab4b5cbfb4d254d644f633a) such that ![Image 14: {\displaystyle X\cap U=\{z\in U\mid f_{1}(z)=\cdots =f_{k}(z)=0\}=Z(f_{1},\dots ,f_{k})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/85618508fe773993e749bff6ab4b910694babcdf). By convention we also require the set ![Image 15: {\displaystyle X}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab) to be [irreducible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreducible_algebraic_set "Irreducible algebraic set"). A point ![Image 16: {\displaystyle p\in X}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fae5d7ae3f7710fc989d0bd6dca038d74107f16d) is _singular_ if the [Jacobian matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobian_matrix "Jacobian matrix") of the vector of holomorphic functions ![Image 17: {\displaystyle (f_{1},\dots ,f_{k})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4d604eeb6714e173ab46fde53ae69e15ba6683b4) does not have full rank at ![Image 18: {\displaystyle p}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/81eac1e205430d1f40810df36a0edffdc367af36), and _non-singular_ otherwise. A **projective complex analytic variety** is a subset ![Image 19: {\displaystyle X\subseteq \mathbb {CP} ^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/400662550aaf0e77c9d8853381c7fd500c87dc83) of [complex projective space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_projective_space "Complex projective space") that is, in the same way, locally given by the zeroes of a finite collection of holomorphic functions on open subsets of ![Image 20: {\displaystyle \mathbb {CP} ^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2f02cfe21a83e074d5589b15f2e5f0947cb39c4d).

One may similarly define an **affine complex algebraic variety** to be a subset ![Image 21: {\displaystyle X\subseteq \mathbb {C} ^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ad8cce1308d7c6f0c30e2af3d62400a2ba2e386f) which is locally given as the zero set of finitely many polynomials in ![Image 22: {\displaystyle n}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b) complex variables. To define a **projective complex algebraic variety**, one requires the subset ![Image 23: {\displaystyle X\subseteq \mathbb {CP} ^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/400662550aaf0e77c9d8853381c7fd500c87dc83) to locally be given by the zero set of finitely many _[homogeneous polynomials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous\_polynomials "Homogeneous polynomials")_.

In order to define a general complex algebraic or complex analytic variety, one requires the notion of a [locally ringed space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locally_ringed_space "Locally ringed space"). A **complex algebraic/analytic variety** is a locally ringed space ![Image 24: {\displaystyle (X,{\mathcal {O}}_{X})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/46716c1fec068ffe9981107a5a215fa1fc9e7d5f) which is locally isomorphic as a locally ringed space to an affine complex algebraic/analytic variety. In the analytic case, one typically allows ![Image 25: {\displaystyle X}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab) to have a topology that is locally equivalent to the subspace topology due to the identification with open subsets of ![Image 26: {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} ^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a53b4e76242764d1bca004168353c380fef25258), whereas in the algebraic case ![Image 27: {\displaystyle X}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab) is often equipped with a [Zariski topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zariski_topology "Zariski topology"). Again we also by convention require this locally ringed space to be irreducible.

Since the definition of a singular point is local, the definition given for an affine analytic/algebraic variety applies to the points of any complex analytic or algebraic variety. The set of points of a variety ![Image 28: {\displaystyle X}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab) which are singular is called the _singular locus_, denoted ![Image 29: {\displaystyle X^{sing}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4633e9dd1905194d4660a972ca0fdffb55f3a1f2), and the complement is the _non-singular_ or _smooth locus_, denoted ![Image 30: {\displaystyle X^{nonsing}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9165d3512f8d48269217c4c696c9c59f6c2f6d1a). We say a complex variety is _smooth_ or _non-singular_ if it's singular locus is empty. That is, if it is equal to its non-singular locus.

By the [implicit function theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_function_theorem "Implicit function theorem") for holomorphic functions, every complex manifold is in particular a non-singular complex analytic variety, but is not in general affine or projective. By Serre's GAGA theorem, every projective complex analytic variety is actually a projective complex algebraic variety. When a complex variety is non-singular, it is a complex manifold. More generally, the non-singular locus of _any_ complex variety is a complex manifold.

Types of complex spaces
-----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Complex_geometry&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Types of complex spaces")]

Complex manifolds may be studied from the perspective of differential geometry, whereby they are equipped with extra geometric structures such as a [Riemannian metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_metric "Riemannian metric") or [symplectic form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symplectic_form "Symplectic form"). In order for this extra structure to be relevant to complex geometry, one should ask for it to be compatible with the complex structure in a suitable sense. A [Kähler manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%A4hler_manifold "Kähler manifold") is a complex manifold with a Riemannian metric and symplectic structure compatible with the complex structure. Every complex submanifold of a Kähler manifold is Kähler, and so in particular every non-singular affine or projective complex variety is Kähler, after restricting the standard Hermitian metric on ![Image 31: {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} ^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a53b4e76242764d1bca004168353c380fef25258) or the [Fubini-Study metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fubini-Study_metric "Fubini-Study metric") on ![Image 32: {\displaystyle \mathbb {CP} ^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2f02cfe21a83e074d5589b15f2e5f0947cb39c4d) respectively.

Other important examples of Kähler manifolds include [Riemann surfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_surface "Riemann surface"), [K3 surfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K3_surface "K3 surface"), and [Calabi–Yau manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calabi%E2%80%93Yau_manifold "Calabi–Yau manifold").

Serre's GAGA theorem asserts that projective complex analytic varieties are actually algebraic. Whilst this is not strictly true for affine varieties, there is a class of complex manifolds that act very much like affine complex algebraic varieties, called [Stein manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stein_manifold "Stein manifold"). A manifold ![Image 33: {\displaystyle X}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab) is Stein if it is holomorphically convex and holomorphically separable (see the article on Stein manifolds for the technical definitions). It can be shown however that this is equivalent to ![Image 34: {\displaystyle X}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab) being a complex submanifold of ![Image 35: {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} ^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a53b4e76242764d1bca004168353c380fef25258) for some ![Image 36: {\displaystyle n}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b). Another way in which Stein manifolds are similar to affine complex algebraic varieties is that [Cartan's theorems A and B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartan%27s_theorems_A_and_B "Cartan's theorems A and B") hold for Stein manifolds.

Examples of Stein manifolds include non-compact Riemann surfaces and non-singular affine complex algebraic varieties.

### Hyper-Kähler manifolds

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Complex_geometry&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Hyper-Kähler manifolds")]

A special class of complex manifolds is [hyper-Kähler manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper-K%C3%A4hler_manifold "Hyper-Kähler manifold"), which are [Riemannian manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_manifold "Riemannian manifold") admitting three distinct compatible [integrable almost complex structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almost_complex_manifold#Integrable_almost_complex_structures "Almost complex manifold")![Image 37: {\displaystyle I,J,K}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2efdcc11995416b87332401cf84636658a9d6d98) which satisfy the [quaternionic relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion "Quaternion")![Image 38: {\displaystyle I^{2}=J^{2}=K^{2}=IJK=-\operatorname {Id} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3381bbcfd48e73da5635a5c3f54d1d88bc98360c). Thus, hyper-Kähler manifolds are Kähler manifolds in three different ways, and subsequently have a rich geometric structure.

Examples of hyper-Kähler manifolds include [ALE spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_instanton "Gravitational instanton"), [K3 surfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K3_surface "K3 surface"), [Higgs bundle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_bundle "Higgs bundle") moduli spaces, [quiver varieties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quiver_(mathematics)#Quiver_Variety "Quiver (mathematics)"), and many other [moduli spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moduli_space "Moduli space") arising out of [gauge theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_theory "Gauge theory") and [representation theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_theory "Representation theory").

### Calabi–Yau manifolds

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Complex_geometry&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Calabi–Yau manifolds")]

[![Image 39](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/CalabiYau5.jpg/250px-CalabiYau5.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:CalabiYau5.jpg)

A real two-dimensional slice of a quintic [Calabi–Yau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calabi%E2%80%93Yau_manifold "Calabi–Yau manifold") threefold

As mentioned, a particular class of Kähler manifolds is given by Calabi–Yau manifolds. These are given by Kähler manifolds with trivial canonical bundle ![Image 40: {\displaystyle K_{X}=\Lambda ^{n}T_{1,0}^{*}X}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e75fc21868e31c7f6eb71e52481125e837d38483). Typically the definition of a Calabi–Yau manifold also requires ![Image 41: {\displaystyle X}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab) to be compact. In this case [Yau's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shing-Tung_Yau "Shing-Tung Yau") proof of the [Calabi conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calabi_conjecture "Calabi conjecture") implies that ![Image 42: {\displaystyle X}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab) admits a Kähler metric with vanishing [Ricci curvature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricci_curvature "Ricci curvature"), and this may be taken as an equivalent definition of Calabi–Yau.

Calabi–Yau manifolds have found use in [string theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory "String theory") and [mirror symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_symmetry_(string_theory) "Mirror symmetry (string theory)"), where they are used to model the extra 6 dimensions of spacetime in 10-dimensional models of string theory. Examples of Calabi–Yau manifolds are given by [elliptic curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve "Elliptic curve"), K3 surfaces, and complex [Abelian varieties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelian_varieties "Abelian varieties").

### Complex Fano varieties

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Complex_geometry&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Complex Fano varieties")]

A complex [Fano variety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fano_variety "Fano variety") is a complex algebraic variety with [ample](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ample_line_bundle "Ample line bundle") anti-canonical line bundle (that is, ![Image 43: {\displaystyle K_{X}^{*}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7b24314b3421001c74b98fb0e5e9622c042e4155) is ample). Fano varieties are of considerable interest in complex algebraic geometry, and in particular [birational geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birational_geometry "Birational geometry"), where they often arise in the [minimal model program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_model_program "Minimal model program"). Fundamental examples of Fano varieties are given by projective space ![Image 44: {\displaystyle \mathbb {CP} ^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2f02cfe21a83e074d5589b15f2e5f0947cb39c4d) where ![Image 45: {\displaystyle K={\mathcal {O}}(-n-1)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f90a7e475ec9155ba596460ff7b49b9ce86a8d5a), and smooth hypersurfaces of ![Image 46: {\displaystyle \mathbb {CP} ^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2f02cfe21a83e074d5589b15f2e5f0947cb39c4d) of degree less than ![Image 47: {\displaystyle n+1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2a135e65a42f2d73cccbfc4569523996ca0036f1).

[![Image 48](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Moment_polytope_of_first_Hirzebruch_surface.png/250px-Moment_polytope_of_first_Hirzebruch_surface.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Moment_polytope_of_first_Hirzebruch_surface.png)

Moment polytope describing the first [Hirzebruch surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirzebruch_surface "Hirzebruch surface").

[Toric varieties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toric_varieties "Toric varieties") are complex algebraic varieties of dimension ![Image 49: {\displaystyle n}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b) containing an open [dense subset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dense_subset "Dense subset") biholomorphic to ![Image 50: {\displaystyle (\mathbb {C} ^{*})^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1053a4e41de862c4cab3e130368e515714faa401), equipped with an action of ![Image 51: {\displaystyle (\mathbb {C} ^{*})^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1053a4e41de862c4cab3e130368e515714faa401) which extends the action on the open dense subset. A toric variety may be described combinatorially by its _toric fan_, and at least when it is non-singular, by a _[moment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment\_map "Moment map") polytope_. This is a polygon in ![Image 52: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c510b63578322050121fe966f2e5770bea43308d) with the property that any vertex may be put into the standard form of the vertex of the positive [orthant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthant "Orthant") by the action of ![Image 53: {\displaystyle \operatorname {GL} (n,\mathbb {Z} )}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0a331e7378914bbd230b51b583f10d7db8ecf114). The toric variety can be obtained as a suitable space which fibres over the polytope.

Many constructions that are performed on toric varieties admit alternate descriptions in terms of the combinatorics and geometry of the moment polytope or its associated toric fan. This makes toric varieties a particularly attractive test case for many constructions in complex geometry. Examples of toric varieties include complex projective spaces, and bundles over them.

Techniques in complex geometry
------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Complex_geometry&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Techniques in complex geometry")]

Due to the rigidity of holomorphic functions and complex manifolds, the techniques typically used to study complex manifolds and complex varieties differ from those used in regular differential geometry, and are closer to techniques used in algebraic geometry. For example, in differential geometry, many problems are approached by taking local constructions and patching them together globally using partitions of unity. Partitions of unity do not exist in complex geometry, and so the problem of when local data may be glued into global data is more subtle. Precisely when local data may be patched together is measured by [sheaf cohomology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheaf_cohomology "Sheaf cohomology"), and [sheaves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheaf_(mathematics) "Sheaf (mathematics)") and their [cohomology groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohomology_groups "Cohomology groups") are major tools.

For example, famous problems in the analysis of several complex variables preceding the introduction of modern definitions are the [Cousin problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cousin_problems "Cousin problems"), asking precisely when local meromorphic data may be glued to obtain a global meromorphic function. These old problems can be simply solved after the introduction of sheaves and cohomology groups.

Special examples of sheaves used in complex geometry include holomorphic [line bundles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_bundle "Line bundle") (and the [divisors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divisor_(algebraic_geometry) "Divisor (algebraic geometry)") associated to them), [holomorphic vector bundles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holomorphic_vector_bundle "Holomorphic vector bundle"), and [coherent sheaves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherent_sheaves "Coherent sheaves"). Since sheaf cohomology measures obstructions in complex geometry, one technique that is used is to prove vanishing theorems. Examples of vanishing theorems in complex geometry include the [Kodaira vanishing theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kodaira_vanishing_theorem "Kodaira vanishing theorem") for the cohomology of line bundles on compact Kähler manifolds, and [Cartan's theorems A and B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartan%27s_theorems_A_and_B "Cartan's theorems A and B") for the cohomology of coherent sheaves on affine complex varieties.

Complex geometry also makes use of techniques arising out of differential geometry and analysis. For example, the [Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch_theorem "Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch theorem"), a special case of the [Atiyah-Singer index theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atiyah-Singer_index_theorem "Atiyah-Singer index theorem"), computes the [holomorphic Euler characteristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holomorphic_Euler_characteristic "Holomorphic Euler characteristic") of a holomorphic vector bundle in terms of characteristic classes of the underlying smooth complex vector bundle.

Classification in complex geometry
----------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Complex_geometry&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Classification in complex geometry")]

One major theme in complex geometry is [classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classification_theorem "Classification theorem"). Due to the rigid nature of complex manifolds and varieties, the problem of classifying these spaces is often tractable. Classification in complex and algebraic geometry often occurs through the study of [moduli spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moduli_space "Moduli space"), which themselves are complex manifolds or varieties whose points classify other geometric objects arising in complex geometry.

The term _moduli_ was coined by [Bernhard Riemann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernhard_Riemann "Bernhard Riemann") during his original work on Riemann surfaces. The classification theory is most well-known for compact Riemann surfaces. By the [classification of closed oriented surfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(topology)#Classification_of_closed_surfaces "Surface (topology)"), compact Riemann surfaces come in a countable number of discrete types, measured by their [genus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus_(topology) "Genus (topology)")![Image 54: {\displaystyle g}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d3556280e66fe2c0d0140df20935a6f057381d77), which is a non-negative integer counting the number of holes in the given compact Riemann surface.

The classification essentially follows from the [uniformization theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniformization_theorem "Uniformization theorem"), and is as follows:[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_geometry#cite_note-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_geometry#cite_note-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_geometry#cite_note-4)

### Holomorphic line bundles

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Complex_geometry&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Holomorphic line bundles")]

Complex geometry is concerned not only with complex spaces, but other holomorphic objects attached to them. The classification of holomorphic line bundles on a complex variety ![Image 55: {\displaystyle X}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab) is given by the [Picard variety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picard_variety "Picard variety")![Image 56: {\displaystyle \operatorname {Pic} (X)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/40065c6da3c5329d7d559c99f4b47502680d6a55) of ![Image 57: {\displaystyle X}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab).

The picard variety can be easily described in the case where ![Image 58: {\displaystyle X}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab) is a compact Riemann surface of genus g. Namely, in this case the Picard variety is a disjoint union of complex [Abelian varieties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelian_varieties "Abelian varieties"), each of which is isomorphic to the [Jacobian variety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobian_variety "Jacobian variety") of the curve, classifying [divisors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divisor_(algebraic_geometry) "Divisor (algebraic geometry)") of degree zero up to linear equivalence. In differential-geometric terms, these Abelian varieties are complex tori, complex manifolds diffeomorphic to ![Image 59: {\displaystyle (S^{1})^{2g}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b60f9091466e3a0d7b749ae80499e25ea52dc08b), possibly with one of many different complex structures.

By the [Torelli theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torelli_theorem "Torelli theorem"), a compact Riemann surface is determined by its Jacobian variety, and this demonstrates one reason why the study of structures on complex spaces can be useful, in that it can allow one to solve classify the spaces themselves.
