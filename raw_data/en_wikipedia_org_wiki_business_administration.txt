[ 1 ] It includes all aspects of overseeing and supervising the business operations of an organization.

Overview [ edit ] The administration of a business includes the performance or management of business operations and decision-making , as well as the efficient organization of people and other resources to direct activities towards common goals . In general, "administration" refers to the broader management function, including the associated finance , personnel and MIS services.

[ 2 ] Administration can refer to the bureaucratic or operational performance of routine office tasks, [ 3 ] usually internally oriented and reactive rather than proactive. Administrators, broadly speaking, engage in a common set of functions to meet an organization's goals.

Henri Fayol (1841–1925) described these "functions" of the administrator as " the five elements of administration ".

[ 4 ] According to Fayol, the five functions of management are planning, organizing, commanding, coordinating, and controlling. Without proper business management, a firm cannot utilize its resources properly so, it is the most important term in running a business firm.

[ 5 ] Key skills for business management [ edit ] Strategic thinking , leadership , problem-solving , communication , and the ability to work effectively with a diverse range of people and organizations are among the key skills and competencies required of effective managers. Managers must also be able to balance the needs and interests of various stakeholders, such as employees, customers, shareholders, and the larger community.

[ 6 ] Management is a critical aspect of any successful organization, and it requires a wide range of skills, knowledge, and expertise. Whether managing a small team or a large corporation, effective management is essential to achieving success and driving growth. Another critical aspect is effectively managing and motivating employees. Managers must be able to foster a positive and productive work environment, as well as recognize and reward employees who contribute to the overall success of the organization. This can include providing opportunities for professional development and growth, as well as establishing clear communication channels and ensuring that everyone understands their role and responsibilities.

The core courses in an MBA program cover various areas of business such as accounting, finance, marketing, human resources, and operations in a manner most relevant to management analysis and strategy.

[ 13 ] Most programs also include elective courses.

[ 17 ] The degree is intended for those seeking academic research- and teaching-careers as faculty or professors in the study of management at business schools worldwide.
