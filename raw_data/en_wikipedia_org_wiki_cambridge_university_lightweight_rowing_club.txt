In April 2020 it was agreed that CULRC would combine with the openweight men's club CUBC and the women's club CUWBC into one club.

[ 2 ] The merger took place on 1 August 2020.

CUBC now selects a lightweight men's Blue Boat from the men's squad to represent Cambridge at the Lightweight Boat Races.

History [ edit ] The club was founded in 1974 by Richard Bates and raced against Oxford in 1975.

[ 3 ] These races were the basis on which the Henley Boat Races were later founded. For more than twenty five years Robert Greatorex presided over the club. In recent years, the club fielded two crews each year, the lightweight Blue Boat and Granta, the lightweight reserve crew. The reserve boat, Granta, raced Oxford's equivalent, Nephthys, from 2000 until 2007 and restarted racing Oxford in a pairs race in recent years.

For a brief period in 1999 - 2002 there was an active old boys club "Farmer" whose finest race was beating the 1999 Nephthys crew by 2L.

[ citation needed ] The Blue Boat crew have the right to wear a distinctive uniform. As a half blue sport, they wear a unique Cambridge blue and white striped blazer with the club insignia on the chest pocket. This blazer design has been retained by the Blue Boat upon merger with CUBC. Blue Boat oarsmen who go on to win a round of the Temple Challenge Cup or Prince Albert Challenge Cup at Henley Royal Regatta in the same season as their Boat Race are awarded Discretionary Full Blues and are entitled to wear a Cambridge blue blazer with the club insignia on the chest pocket. Granta members who race in the Reserve race against Nepthys are entitled to wear the Granta Colours blazer, the same design as the Blue Boat but without the club insignia on the chest pocket.
