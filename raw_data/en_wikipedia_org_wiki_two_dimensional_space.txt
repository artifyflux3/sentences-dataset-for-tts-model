Euclidean space has parallel lines which extend infinitely while remaining equidistant. In non-Euclidean spaces, lines perpendicular to a traversal either converge or diverge.

A **two-dimensional space** is a [mathematical space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_space "Mathematical space") with two [dimensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension "Dimension"), meaning [points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(geometry) "Point (geometry)") have two [degrees of freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrees_of_freedom "Degrees of freedom"): their locations can be [locally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_property "Local property") described with two [coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate "Coordinate") or they can move in two independent directions. Common two-dimensional spaces are often called _[planes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane\_(mathematics) "Plane (mathematics)")_, or, more generally, _[surfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface\_(mathematics) "Surface (mathematics)")_. These include analogs to physical spaces, like flat planes, and curved surfaces like spheres, cylinders, and cones, which can be infinite or finite. Some two-dimensional mathematical spaces are not used to represent physical positions, like an [affine plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_plane "Affine plane") or [complex plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_plane "Complex plane").

The most basic example is the flat [Euclidean plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_plane "Euclidean plane"), an idealization of a flat surface in [physical space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_space "Physical space") such as a sheet of paper or a chalkboard. On the Euclidean plane, any two points can be joined by a unique [straight line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_line "Straight line") along which the [distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance "Euclidean distance") can be measured. The space is flat because any two lines [transversed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transversal_(geometry) "Transversal (geometry)") by a third line [perpendicular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpendicular "Perpendicular") to both of them are [parallel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_lines "Parallel lines"), meaning they never [intersect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersection_(geometry) "Intersection (geometry)") and stay at uniform distance from each-other.

Two-dimensional spaces can also be [curved](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curved_space "Curved space"), for example the [sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere "Sphere") and [hyperbolic plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_plane "Hyperbolic plane"), sufficiently small portions of which appear like the flat plane, but on which straight lines which are locally parallel do not stay equidistant from each-other but eventually converge or diverge, respectively. Two-dimensional spaces with a locally Euclidean concept of distance but which can have non-uniform [curvature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_curvature "Gaussian curvature") are called [Riemannian surfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry_of_surfaces "Differential geometry of surfaces"). (Not to be confused with [Riemann surfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_surfaces "Riemann surfaces").) Some surfaces are [embedded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedding "Embedding") in [three-dimensional Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_Euclidean_space "Three-dimensional Euclidean space") or some other [ambient space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_space_(mathematics) "Ambient space (mathematics)"), and inherit their structure from it; for example, [ruled surfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruled_surface "Ruled surface") such as the [cylinder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylinder "Cylinder") and [cone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone "Cone") contain a straight line through each point, and [minimal surfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_surface "Minimal surface") locally minimize their area, as is done physically by [soap films](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soap_film "Soap film").

[Lorentzian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentzian_manifold "Lorentzian manifold") surfaces look locally like a two-dimensional slice of [relativistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity "Special relativity")[spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime "Spacetime") with one spatial and one time dimension; constant-curvature examples are the flat Lorentzian plane (a two-dimensional subspace of [Minkowski space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_space "Minkowski space")) and the curved [de Sitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Sitter_space "De Sitter space") and [anti-de Sitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-de_Sitter_space "Anti-de Sitter space") planes.

Other types of mathematical planes and surfaces modify or do away with the structures defining the Euclidean plane. For example, the [affine plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_plane "Affine plane") has a notion of parallel lines but no notion of distance; however, [signed areas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signed_area "Signed area") can be meaningfully compared, as they can in a more general [symplectic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symplectic_manifold "Symplectic manifold") surface. The [projective plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_plane "Projective plane") does away with both distance and parallelism. A two-dimensional [metric space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_space "Metric space") has some concept of distance but it need not match the Euclidean version. A [topological surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(topology) "Surface (topology)") can be stretched, twisted, or bent without changing its essential properties. An [algebraic surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_surface "Algebraic surface") is a two-dimensional set of solutions of a [system of polynomial equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_polynomial_equations "System of polynomial equations").

Some mathematical spaces have additional arithmetical structure associated with their points. A [vector plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_plane "Vector plane") is an affine plane whose points, called _[vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric\_vector "Geometric vector")_, include a special designated [origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_(mathematics) "Origin (mathematics)") or zero vector. Vectors can be added together or [scaled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaling_(geometry) "Scaling (geometry)") by a number, and optionally have a Euclidean, Lorentzian, or Galilean concept of distance. The [complex plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_plane "Complex plane"), [hyperbolic number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_number "Hyperbolic number") plane, and [dual number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_number "Dual number") plane each have points which are considered numbers themselves, and can be added and multiplied. A [Riemann surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_surface "Riemann surface") or [Lorentz surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_surface "Lorentz surface") appear locally like the complex plane or hyperbolic number plane, respectively.

Definition and meaning
----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Two-dimensional_space&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Definition and meaning")]

Mathematical spaces are often defined or represented using numbers rather than [geometric axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_geometry "Foundations of geometry"). One of the most fundamental two-dimensional spaces is the [real coordinate space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_coordinate_space "Real coordinate space"), denoted ![Image 2: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{2},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d349b099a2e00103b347c5f640a30e0af2a6ee18) consisting of pairs of [real-number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number") coordinates. Sometimes the space represents arbitrary quantities rather than geometric positions, as in the [parameter space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter_space "Parameter space") of a mathematical model or the [configuration space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Configuration_space_(physics) "Configuration space (physics)") of a physical system.

More generally, other types of numbers can be used as coordinates. The [complex plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_plane "Complex plane") is two-dimensional when considered to be formed from real-number coordinates, but [one-dimensional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-dimensional_space "One-dimensional space") in terms of [complex-number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number "Complex number") coordinates. A two-dimensional complex space – such as the two-dimensional [complex coordinate space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_coordinate_space "Complex coordinate space"), the [complex projective plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_projective_plane "Complex projective plane"), or a [complex surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_surface "Complex surface") – has two complex dimensions, which can alternately be represented using four real dimensions. A [two-dimensional lattice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_(group)#Lattices_in_two_dimensions:_detailed_discussion "Lattice (group)") is an infinite grid of points which can be represented using [integer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer "Integer") coordinates. Some two-dimensional spaces, such as [finite planes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_plane "Finite plane"), have only a [finite set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_set "Finite set") of elements.
