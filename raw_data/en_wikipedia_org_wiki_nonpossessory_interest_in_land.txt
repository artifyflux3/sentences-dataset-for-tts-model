Creation [ edit ] Such rights can generally be created in one of two ways: either by an express agreement between the party who owns the land and the party who seeks to own the interest, such as by a deed or indenture ; or by an order of a court , as an implied agreement.

Types [ edit ] Under the common law , there are five variations of such rights. These are: easements profits restrictive covenants equitable servitudes , and licenses .

The Restatement of the Law of Property both clarifies and expands upon the types of nonpossessory interests. For example, in § 28, a reversion is defined as "a nonpossessory  interest in land remaining after the creation of one or more estates or interests in fee tail, for life, for years, for a periodic term, or at will."
