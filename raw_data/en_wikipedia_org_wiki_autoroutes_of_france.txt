It is a network of 11,882 km (7,383 mi) of motorways as of 2014. On road signs, autoroute destinations are shown in blue, while destinations reached through a combination of autoroutes are shown with an added autoroute logo. Toll autoroutes are signalled with the word péage (toll or toll plaza).

A1, A3, A4, A5, A6, A10, A13, A14, A15, A16 radiate clockwise from Paris, with A2, A11, and A12 branching from A1, A10, and A13, respectively. A7 begins in Lyon, where A6 ends. A8 and A9 begin from the A7.

The 20s are found in northern and northwestern France. The 30s are found in eastern and northeastern France. The 40s are found near the Alps. The 50s are in the southeast, near the French Riviera. The 60s are found in southern France. The 70s are found in the center of the country. The 80s are found in western France, except for the A89 autoroute which goes from southwestern to eastern France.

Administration [ edit ] The status of motorways in France has been the subject of debate through years, from their construction until recently. Originally, the autoroutes were built by private companies mandated by the French government and followed strict construction rules as described below. They are operated and maintained by mixed companies held in part by private interests and in part by the state. Those companies hold concessions, which means that autoroutes belong to the French state and their administration to semi-private companies.

Vinci controls around 4,380 km (2,720 mi) of motorway. The different companies are as follows: ALIS (SEM, SAPN 8%, Bouygues 20.2%, Ixis 26%, DTP Terrassement 13.44%), operating the A28 Rouen-Alençon 125 km, Alis, official site SAPRR ( Autoroutes Paris-Rhin-Rhône ), 1801 km, SAPRR, official site AREA ( Société des Autoroutes Rhône-Alpes , SAPRR Subsidiary at 99.82%), 381 km, AREA, official site ASF ( Autoroutes du sud de la France ), 2325 km, ASF, official site Archived 2006-12-06 at the Wayback Machine (bought by vinci-autoroutes.com Vinci ) ATMB Autoroutes et tunnels du Mont-Blanc , 107 km, ATMB, official site CEVM ( Viaduc de Millau , groupe Eiffage ), 2.5 km, CEVM, official site Cofiroute (Compagnie Industrielle et Financière des Autoroutes, private company part of Vinci group), 896 km, Cofiroute, official site Escota ( Société des Autoroutes Esterel-Côte d'Azur , ASF group), 460 km, Escota, official site (bought by vinci-autoroutes.com Vinci ) Sanef (Société des autoroutes du Nord et de l'Est de la France), A.C.S. group (Spain), 1317 km, SANEF, official site SAPN (Société des autoroutes Paris-Normandie, SEM, groupe Sanef ), 366 km, SAPN, official site SFTRF , Société française du tunnel routier du Fréjus , 67 km, SFRTF, official site Only in the Brittany region do most of the autoroutes belong to the government.

Source ASFA [ 2 ] Safety on French autoroutes [ edit ] Motorway speed limits [ edit ] France has the following speed limits for limited access roads classified as motorways: Under normal conditions - 130 km/h (80 mph) In rain or wet road conditions - 110 km/h (70 mph) In heavy fog or snowy/icy conditions - 50 km/h (30 mph) Limited access roads classified as express roads have lower speed limit (90 or 110 km/h, 55 or 70 mph).

In normal conditions, there is a minimum speed of 80 km/h (50 mph) in the leftmost lane. There is no minimum speed on the others lanes, however the speed must be adapted to the conditions and not constitute a hazard by being too slow.

Safe design [ edit ] Dynamic information panel used on the French Autoroute.

The autoroutes are designed to increase driver safety and allow for higher speed limits (130 km/h or 80 mph) than on regular roads (80 km/h or 50 mph) without increasing the risk of accidents.

The safety features include: one way driving: the lanes driving in the opposite direction are separated by at least a crash barrier designed to resist the oblique impact of a car at up to 180 km/h (110 mph); there are no intersecting roads but overpasses and underpasses; wider carriageways, with at least 2 (often 3) lanes driving in the same direction, with a larger turning radius - some recently built autoroutes have one-lane-only sections ; for privately operated motorways, in 2017, the proportion is 6800 km (74%) in 2x2 lanes, 2252 km (25%) in 2x3 lanes, 84 km (1%) in 2x4 lanes.

[ 2 ] Each lane is 3.5m wide.

[ 5 ] long entrance and exit ramps or slip roads to get in or out of the autoroute without disturbing the traffic; an emergency lane , where it is forbidden to drive (except for emergency services), to park (except in case of emergency) and to walk; [ 6 ] Since 2000, new emergency lanes on newly built motorways should be 2.5m wide (or 3m if there are more than 2000 trucks a day). According to the 2000 standard, the emergency lane must be included in a 10m wide (8.5m for sections limited to 110 km/h) security zone without obstacles (in case the security zone includes an upwards slope, it is limited to the line where the slope reaches a height of 3m).

[ 5 ] presence of emergency call boxes every 2 km (1.2 mi) on each side, that allow to call for help with the possibility to locate the call; some call boxes have flashing light that warn when there is a problem ahead; Sign indicating a picnic place in an aire de repos .

rest areas ( aire de repos , i.e. car park with public toilets) every 10 km (6.2 mi) (4–6 minutes of driving) and service areas ( aire de service with a least a gas station) every 40 km (25 mi) (20–30 minutes of driving) - on most recently built autoroutes these distances may be longer, up to 30/60km ; regularly patrolling security services, to clear any obstacle and protect drivers in trouble (usually a breakdown or a flat tyre) with appropriate warning signs and beacons; dynamic information panels that warn about possible difficulties ahead (e.g. accident, roadworks, traffic jam); a radio station (107.7 MHz in FM) provides traffic information bulletins every 15 minutes (with a report in English in certain areas) and breaking news for emergencies; on heavy traffic days (e.g. beginning and end of school holidays), specific information and recreation events may be organised in rest areas; radars automatiques (speed cameras) are installed in many locations, and announced by a specific road sign.

Safety results [ edit ] Fatalities on motorways have decreased between 2002 and 2016.

[ 8 ] Three scenarios catch two-thirds of initial accidents: [ 8 ] A01 simple collision of two vehicle without direction change A06 crash on protection system such as safety traffic barrier A05 loss of vehicle control Fatalities and accidents remaining factors [ edit ] Most of fatalities occur by night.

Source ASFA [ 7 ] Pedestrians [ edit ] Although pedestrians are forbidden on motorways in conformity with the Vienna Convention , they are still sometimes killed on motorways.

In case a vehicle on a carriage cannot move, motorways safety rules remains applicable: it is forbidden for a pedestrian to travel on the motorway by article 421-2 from the "Code de la route" law.

[ 10 ] For this reason, in case of accident or breakdown, it is advised to turn on hazard warning lights, wear high-visibility clothing , and go in a safer place such as the other side from the traffic barrier where there is no traffic. Since 2008, it is clarified that warning triangles are no longer mandatory when they would endanger the driver of the disabled vehicle.

Source ASFA Economics [ edit ] Toll barrier in Hordain (north of France), on autoroute A2 The toll roads were granted as concessions to mixed-economy corporations; the free roads are directly administered by the national government. Tolls are either based on a flat-rate for access to the road or on the distance driven. The latter case is the most common for long distances; users take a ticket from an automatic machine when they enter the autoroute, and pay according to the distance when exiting; toll booths accept multiple payment methods.

Sign indicating a péage .

In 2005, the Villepin government proposed a controversial plan to sell all of the state's holdings in autoroute companies to private investors. Critics contend that the price announced is well below the profit forecasts for these companies, and thus that the government sacrifices the future to solve current budgetary problems.
