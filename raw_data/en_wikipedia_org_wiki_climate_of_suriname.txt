Suriname is located in the northern part of South America and is part of Caribbean South America , bordering the North Atlantic Ocean , between French Guiana and Guyana . It is mostly covered by tropical rainforest, containing a great diversity of flora and fauna that, for the most part, are increasingly threatened by new development. There is a relatively small population, most of which live along the coast.

There are currently two unresolved border disputes that affect the geography of Suriname, namely the Tigri Area in the southwestern region near Guyana and also the Marouini/Litani region with French Guiana in the southeast.

Location [ edit ] Geographic coordinates: 4°00′N 56°00′W ﻿ / ﻿ 4.000°N 56.000°W ﻿ / 4.000; -56.000 Continent: South America Area [ edit ] Total: 163,820 square kilometers (63,250 sq mi) Land: 156,000 square kilometers (60,000 sq mi) Water: 7,820 square kilometers (3,020 sq mi) Area - comparative: See order of magnitude 1 E+11 m² . Slightly larger than Tunisia .

Land boundaries [ edit ] Main article: Borders of Suriname Suriname with the disputed areas, including the Tigri Area controlled by Guyana and southeastern area controlled by French Guiana .

Suriname (circa 1914) in the Encyclopedia of the Dutch West Indies, by Surinamese cartographer Herman Benjamins and Dutch ethnographer Johannes Snelleman .

Total: 1,703 kilometers (1,058 mi) Border countries: Brazil - 593 kilometers (368 mi) French Guiana - 510 kilometers (320 mi) Guyana - 600 kilometers (370 mi) Coastline: 386 kilometers (240 mi) Maritime claims [ edit ] Exclusive economic zone : 127,772 km 2 (49,333 sq mi) and 200 nmi (370.4 km; 230.2 mi) Territorial sea: 12 nmi (22.2 km; 13.8 mi) Climate and climate change [ edit ] Further information: Climate change in Suriname Suriname has a tropical rainforest climate and a tropical monsoon climate , with hot humid conditions year-round.

[ 1 ] Climate change in both Suriname and the wider world is leading to hotter temperatures and more extreme weather . As a fairly poor country, its contributions to global climate change have been limited. Suriname has a large forest cover, the country has been running a carbon negative economy since 2014.

[ 2 ] Hotter temperatures [ 3 ] and changes in precipitation trends [ 4 ] are predicted because of climate change.

A recent global remote sensing analysis suggested that there were 781 km² of tidal flats in Suriname, making it the 34th ranked country in terms of tidal flat area.

[ 7 ] Elevation extremes Lowest point: Unnamed location in the coastal plain - 2 meters (6.6 ft) below Sea Level.

Highest point: Juliana Top - 1,230 meters (4,040 ft) Natural resources [ edit ] Timber, hydropower, fish, forests, hydroelectric potential, kaolin, shrimp, bauxite and gold. Small amounts of nickel, copper, platinum and iron ore. It also has sizeable oil.

Water [ edit ] The country has one large reservoir , the Brokopondo Reservoir . Several rivers run through it, including the Suriname River , Nickerie River and Maroni or Marowijne River.

Land use [ edit ] (2018 Estimates) Arable land: 0.4% Permanent crops: 0.0% permanent pasture: 0.1% forest: 94.6% Other: 4.9% Irrigated land [ edit ] 510 square kilometers (200 sq mi) (2003) Natural hazards [ edit ] Tropical Showers, no hurricanes.

[ citation needed ] Environment [ edit ] Share of forest area in total land area, top countries (2021). Suriname has the highest percentage of forest cover in the world.

Current issues [ edit ] Deforestation is a real problem as timber is cut for export. There is also a lot of pollution of inland waterways by small-scale mining activities.

Climate change [ edit ] This section is an excerpt from Climate change in Suriname .

[ edit ] Köppen climate classification map for Suriname for 1991–2020 2071–2099 map under the most intense climate change scenario . Mid-range scenarios are currently considered more likely [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] Climate change in Suriname is leading to warmer temperatures and more extreme weather events in Suriname . As a relatively poor country, its contributions to global climate change have been limited. Because of the large forest cover , the country has been running a carbon negative economy since 2014.

[ 11 ] Suriname was the second country to update its Nationally Determined Contributions in 2020.

[ 12 ] International agreements [ edit ] Suriname has agreed to the following agreements: Biodiversity , Climate Change , Endangered Species , Kyoto Protocol , Law of the Sea , Marine Dumping--London Convention , Marine Dumping--London Protocol , Ozone Layer Protection , Paris Accords Ship Pollution , Tropical Timber 94 , Wetlands , Whaling [ 13 ] Extreme points [ edit ] Northernmost point – Oostelijke Polders Southernmost point – Border with Brazil Coeroeni Westernmost point – Border with Guyana , Sipaliwini District Easternmost point – Border with French Guiana , Sipaliwini District Highest point – Julianatop : 1,230 m Lowest point – unnamed location on the coastal plain: -2 m See also [ edit ] Tigri Area , an unresolved territorial dispute involving Guyana and Suriname.

Medium-range estimates of Arctic carbon emissions could result from moderate climate emission mitigation policies that keep global warming below 3°C (e.g., RCP4.5). This global warming level most closely matches country emissions reduction pledges made for the Paris Climate Agreement...

"The IPCC doesn't make projections about which of these scenarios is more likely, but other researchers and modellers can.

The Australian Academy of Science , for instance, released a report last year stating that our current emissions trajectory had us headed for a 3°C warmer world, roughly in line with the middle scenario.

Climate Action Tracker predicts 2.5 to 2.9°C of warming based on current policies and action, with pledges and government agreements taking this to 2.1°C.
