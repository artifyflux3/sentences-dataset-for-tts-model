He studied in Modena under the poet and humanist Gaspare Trimbocchi (il Tribraco). In Forlì he was the teacher of Sinibaldo Ordelaffi , son of the Lord of the city, Pino III Ordelaffi .

Urceo Codro is remembered, among other things, for writing a new fifth act for the Aulularia of Plautus (of the original fifth act of the play only fragments survive). Later other authors, e.g.

Martin Dorp , provided their own versions of the missing scenes.

[ 3 ] Urceo was esteemed in his time as a Greek scholar; Angelo Poliziano wrote to ask his opinion on some Greek poems, [ 4 ] and the second volume of Greek epistolographers printed by Aldus Manutius was dedicated to Urceo.

[ 5 ] Urceo's biography was written by Carlo Malagola .
