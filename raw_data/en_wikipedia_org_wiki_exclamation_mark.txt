The **exclamation mark****!** (also known as **exclamation point** in [American English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English "American English")) is a [punctuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punctuation "Punctuation") mark usually used after an [interjection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interjection "Interjection") or exclamation to indicate strong feelings or to show [emphasis](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/emphasis "wikt:emphasis"). The exclamation mark often marks the end of a sentence. For example: "Watch out!". Similarly, a bare exclamation mark (with nothing before or after) is frequently used in [warning signs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warning_sign "Warning sign"). Additionally, the exclamation mark is commonly used in writing to make a character seem as though they are shouting, excited, or surprised.

The exclamation mark likely originated from the word _io_, which evolved to resemble the mark. Scholar Iacopo Alpoleio da Urbisaglia established its use as [punctuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punctuation "Punctuation") by creating a symbol that resembled the exclamation mark, which was used to convey emotions.

Other uses include:

*   In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), it denotes the [factorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial "Factorial") operation.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-Math_is_Fun-1)
*   Several computer languages use ! at the beginning of an [expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_(computer_science) "Expression (computer science)") to denote logical [negation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negation "Negation"). For example,`!A` means "the logical negation of A", also called "not A". This usage has spread to ordinary language (e.g., "!clue" means no-clue or clueless).
*   Some languages use [ǃ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C7%83 "ǃ"), a symbol that looks like an exclamation mark, to denote a [click consonant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Click_consonant "Click consonant").

Some linguists propose that it is derived from a [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin "Latin") exclamation of joy, namely _io_,[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-3)[[b]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-5) analogous to "hooray";[[c]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-7) scribes wrote _io_ at the end of sentences to express joy.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-Partridge-1953-4)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-Lobo-2021-6)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-Eveleth-2012-8)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-Nordquist-2025-9)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-:1-10) Over time, scribes placed the "i" above the "o". Then, they removed the [tittle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tittle "Tittle") (dot) from the "i". Finally, they made the "o" smaller (ı̥) and eventually they turned it into a dot.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-Partridge-1953-4)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-Lobo-2021-6)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-Eveleth-2012-8)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-Nordquist-2025-9)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-:1-10)[[d]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-11)[[e]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-12)

Linguists trace its evolution as [punctuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punctuation "Punctuation") back to the 14th century during the [Italian Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Renaissance "Italian Renaissance"), when Italian scholar Iacopo Alpoleio da Urbisaglia invented it.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-13)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-BBC-R4-14)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-Weiskott-15)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-Ore-2023-16)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-Humez-2008-17) According to literary scholar Florence Hazrat, he "felt very annoyed" that people read script with a flat tone, when written to elicit emotions, leading him to make the mark.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-BBC-R4-14)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-Hazrat-2022-18)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-Ore-2023-16) His symbol resembled the modern exclamation mark; he proposed it as a period with an apostrophe above.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-BBC-R4-14)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-Hazrat-2022-18)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-Ore-2023-16) This mark indicated emotions such as admiration, surprise, and others.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-Nordquist-2025-9)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-BBC-R4-14)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-Weiskott-15) In his treatise, he named it the _punctus admirativus/exclamativus_; however, this name would fall out of use over time.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-Lobo-2021-6)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-Weiskott-15)

Italian writer [Coluccio Salutati](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coluccio_Salutati "Coluccio Salutati") first used the symbol during the late 15th century, leading to its frequent usage.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-:0-19)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-BBC-R4-14) Shortly after, it was introduced into English printing to emphasize sentences.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-Nordquist-2025-9)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-:1-10)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-Ore-2023-16)[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-truss-20) Over time, the symbol was referred to by many names, including _point of admiration or exclamation_,[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-Weiskott-15)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-Hazrat-2022-18)[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-:3-21)[[f]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-22)[[g]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-23)_note of exclamation or admiration,_[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-Partridge-1953-4)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-Lobo-2021-6)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-Humez-2008-17)[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-24)[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-:2-25)_sign of admiration or exclamation_,[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-26)[[h]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-27)_exclamation point_,[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-Partridge-1953-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-Eveleth-2012-8)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-Weiskott-15)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-Ore-2023-16)[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-:2-25)[[i]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-28) and, _exclamation mark_.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-Partridge-1953-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-Eveleth-2012-8)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-BBC-R4-14)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-Ore-2023-16)[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-29)

Older or portable [typewriters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typewriter "Typewriter") often lacked the exclamation mark; therefore, users typed a [period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop "Full stop"), backspaced, and then typed an [apostrophe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe "Apostrophe") to replicate it.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-Eveleth-2012-8)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-Nordquist-2025-9)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-Ore-2023-16)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-Hazrat-2022-18)[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-truss-20)

Slang and other names for the exclamation mark
----------------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Exclamation_mark&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Slang and other names for the exclamation mark")]

Now obsolete, the name _[ecphoneme](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ecphoneme "wiktionary:ecphoneme")_ was documented in the early 20th century.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-30)

In the 1950s, secretarial dictation and typesetting manuals in America referred to the mark as "bang",[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-Eveleth-2012-8)[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-31)[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-32) perhaps from comic books – where the! appeared in dialogue bubbles to represent a gun being fired,[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-33) although the nickname probably emerged from letterpress printing.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-Haley-2008-34) This "bang" usage is behind the names of the [interrobang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrobang "Interrobang"), an unconventional typographic character, and the [shebang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix) "Shebang (Unix)"), a feature of [Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix "Unix") computer systems.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-Eveleth-2012-8)

In the printing world, the exclamation mark can be called a screamer, a gasper, a slammer, a dog's cock, or a startler.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-Eveleth-2012-8)[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-35)

In [hacker culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_(programmer_subculture) "Hacker (programmer subculture)"), the exclamation mark is called "bang", "shriek", or, in the British slang known as Commonwealth Hackish, "pling".[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-Jargon_File-36) For example, the password communicated in the spoken phrase "Your password is em-zero-pee-aitch-bang-en-three" ("em-nought-pee-aitch-pling-en-three" in Commonwealth Hackish) is `m0ph!n3`.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-Jargon_File-36)

The exclamation mark is mainly used in languages that use the [Latin alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_alphabet "Latin alphabet"), although usage slightly varies. It has also been adopted in languages written in other scripts, such as languages written with [Cyrillic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrillic_script "Cyrillic script") or [Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_script "Arabic script") scripts, [Chinese characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_characters "Chinese characters"), and [Devanagari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devanagari "Devanagari").

A sentence ending in an exclamation mark may represent an [exclamation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_(linguistics) "Sentence (linguistics)") or an [interjection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_(linguistics) "Sentence (linguistics)") (such as "Wow!", "Boo!"), or an [imperative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_mood "Imperative mood") ("Stop!"), or may indicate astonishment or surprise: "They were the footprints of a gigantic hound!" Exclamation marks are occasionally placed mid-sentence with a function similar to a comma, for dramatic effect, although this usage is obsolete: "On the walk, oh! there was a frightful noise."[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-37)

Informally, exclamation marks may be repeated for additional emphasis ("That's great!!!"), but this practice is generally considered unacceptable in formal prose.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-38)

The exclamation mark is sometimes used in conjunction with the [question mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark "Question mark"). This can be in protest or astonishment ("Out of all places, the squatter-camp?!"); a few writers replace this with a single, unconventional punctuation mark, the [interrobang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrobang "Interrobang"), which is the combination of a question mark and an exclamation mark.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-39)

Overly frequent use of the exclamation mark is generally considered poor writing, as it distracts the reader and decreases the mark's significance.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-40)[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-41)

> Cut out all these exclamation points... An exclamation point is like laughing at your own joke.

Some authors, most notably [Tom Wolfe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Wolfe "Tom Wolfe"), are known for their unashamedly liberal use of the exclamation mark. In [comic books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_book "Comic book"), the very frequent use of exclamation marks is common—see [Comics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#Comics), below.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-BBC-R4-14)

For information on the use of spaces after an exclamation mark, see the discussion of [spacing after a period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop#Spacing_after_a_full_stop "Full stop").

Several studies have shown that women use exclamation marks more than men do. One study suggests that, in addition to other uses, exclamation marks may also function as markers of friendly interaction, for example, by making "Hi!" or "Good luck!" seem friendlier than simply "Hi." or "Good luck." (with periods).[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-Carol-43) However, use of exclamation marks in contexts that are not unambiguously positive can be misinterpreted as indicating hostility.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-Carol-43)

In [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Language "English Language") writing and often [subtitles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtitle_(captioning) "Subtitle (captioning)"), a **(!)** symbol (an exclamation mark within [parentheses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bracket#Parentheses "Bracket")) implies that a character has made an obviously [sarcastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcasm "Sarcasm") comment e.g.: "_Ooh, a sarcasm detector. That's a **really useful** invention(!)_"[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-44) It is also used to indicate surprise at one's own experience or statement.

In [French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Language "French Language"), as well as marking exclamations or indicating astonishment, the exclamation mark is commonly used to mark orders or requests: _Viens ici !_ (English: 'Come here!'). When available, a ['narrow no-break space'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-breaking_space#Width_variation "Non-breaking space") (_espace fine insécable_) is used between the last word and the exclamation mark in European French. If not, a regular [non-breaking space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-breaking_space "Non-breaking space") (_espace insécable_) is currently used. In [Canadian French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_French "Canadian French"), either no space is used or a small space (_espace fine insécable_) is inserted if available. One can also combine an exclamation mark with a question mark at the end of a sentence where appropriate.

[German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language "German language") uses the exclamation mark for several things that English conveys with other [punctuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punctuation "Punctuation"):[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-45)[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-46)

*   It is used at the end of [imperative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_mood "Imperative mood") sentences, even when not particularly emphatic: _Ruf mich morgen an!_ (English: 'Call me tomorrow.') A normal period, as in English, is fairly common but is considered substandard.
*   A related use is on signs that express a command or interdiction: _Betreten verboten!_ (English: 'No trespassing!').
*   The exclamation mark may also be used in the salutation line of a letter: _Lieber Hans!_ (English: 'Dear Hans,'), especially in [Austrian German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_German "Austrian German"). However, the use of a [comma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma_(punctuation) "Comma (punctuation)") is equally correct and is more common.

Cantonese has not historically used dedicated punctuation marks, rather relying on grammatical markers to denote the end of a statement. Usage of exclamation marks is common in written [Mandarin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandarin_Chinese "Mandarin Chinese") and in some [Yue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yue_Chinese "Yue Chinese") speaking regions.[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-routledge-47) The [Canton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong "Guangdong") and [Hong Kong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong "Hong Kong") regions, however, generally refused to accept the exclamation mark as it was seen as carrying with it unnecessary and confusing Western connotations. However, an exclamation mark, including in some written representations of colloquy in [Cantonese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Written_Cantonese "Written Cantonese"), can be used informally to indicate strong feelings.

In [Modern Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Greek "Modern Greek"), the exclamation mark (Θαυμαστικό, _thavmastikó_) has been introduced from [Latin scripts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_script "Latin script") and is used identically, although without the reluctance seen in [English usage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#English).[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-48) A minor grammatical difference is that, while a series of interjections each employ an exclamation mark (e.g., Ωχ! Αχ!, [_Ōch! Ach!_, 'Oops! Oh!']), an interjection should only be separated from an extended exclamation by a comma (e.g., Ωχ, ξέχασα το μάτι της κουζίνας ανοιχτό!, _Ōch, xéchasa to máti tīs kouzínas anoichtó!_, 'Oops! I left the stove on.').

In [Hungarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_language "Hungarian language"), an exclamation mark is put at the end of exclamatory, imperative or prohibitive sentences, and sentences expressing a wish (e.g. _De szép!_ – 'How beautiful!', _A fűre lépni tilos!_ – 'Keep off the grass', _Bárcsak sikerülne a tervem!_ – 'If only my plan would work out.'). The use of the exclamation mark is also needed when addressing someone and the addressing is a separate sentence. (typically at the beginning of letters, e.g. _Kedves Péter!_ – 'Dear Peter,').[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-49) Greetings are also typically terminated with an exclamation mark (e.g. _Jó estét!_ – 'Good evening.').

### Solomon Islands Pidgin

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Exclamation_mark&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Solomon Islands Pidgin")]

In [Solomon Islands Pidgin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Islands_Pidgin "Solomon Islands Pidgin"), the phrase may be between admiration marks. Compare _Nomoa._ ("No.") and _!Nomoa nao!_ ("Certainly not!").[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-50)

[![Image 1](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/Billboard_at_Montju%C3%AFc%2C_Barcelona_%28detail%29.jpg/250px-Billboard_at_Montju%C3%AFc%2C_Barcelona_%28detail%29.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Billboard_at_Montju%C3%AFc,_Barcelona_(detail).jpg)

Trilingual billboard in [Barcelona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona "Barcelona") (detail), showing the initial exclamation mark for Spanish, but not for [Catalan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_language "Catalan language") (top line) and English

In [Spanish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Language "Spanish Language"), a sentence or clause ending in an exclamation mark must also begin with an [inverted exclamation mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_question_and_exclamation_marks "Inverted question and exclamation marks") (the same also applies to the question mark): _¿Estás loco? ¡Casi la matas!_, 'Are you crazy? You almost killed her!'[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-BBC-R4-14)

As in [British English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English "British English"), a bracketed exclamation mark may be used to indicate irony or surprise at a statement: _Dice que esta noche no va a salir de fiesta (!)_, 'He said that he's not going to a party tonight(!).' Such use is not matched by an inverted opening exclamation mark.[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-RAE-51)

In [Turkish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_language "Turkish language"), an exclamation mark is used after a sentence or phrase for [emphasis](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/emphasis "wikt:emphasis"), and is common following both commands and the addressees of such commands. For example, in the _Ordular! İlk hedefiniz Akdenizdir, ileri!_ ('Armies! Your first target is the Mediterranean') order by [Atatürk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atat%C3%BCrk "Atatürk"), _ordular_ ('the armies') constitute the addressee. It is further used in parentheses, _(!)_, after a sentence or phrase to indicate [irony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irony "Irony") or [sarcasm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcasm "Sarcasm"): _Çok iyi bir iş yaptın (!)_, 'You've done a very good job – [Not!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not! "Not!")'.[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-52)

In [Limbu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limbu_language "Limbu language"), an exclamation mark (᥄) is used after a Limbu sentence or phrase for [emphasis](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/emphasis "wikt:emphasis"), and is common following both commands and the addressees of such commands. For example, in the Limbu sentence ᤐᤚᤢ᥄ ᤄᤨᤘᤑ ᤂᤥᤆᤌᤙ Mediterranean, ᤚᤦᤛᤅ᥄ (_Paṡu! Ghōwapha khōcathaśa Mediterranean, ṡausaṅa!_, 'Armies! Your first target is the _Mediterranean_!').

It is further used in parentheses, (᥄), after a sentence or phrase to indicate [irony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irony "Irony") or [sarcasm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcasm "Sarcasm"): ᤖᤥᤂᤌ ᤔᤚᤗ ᤐᤤ ᤊᤇ ᤃᤦᤄ (᥄) (_Rōkhatha maṡala pai yancha gaugha (!)_, 'You did a very good job — [Not!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not! "Not!")').[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-53)

In [Khoisan languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khoisan_languages "Khoisan languages"), and the [International Phonetic Alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet "International Phonetic Alphabet"), a symbol that looks like the exclamation mark is used as a letter to indicate the [postalveolar click](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postalveolar_click "Postalveolar click") sound (represented as _q_ in [Zulu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zulu_language "Zulu language") orthography). It is actually a vertical bar with underdot. In [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode "Unicode"), this letter is properly coded as U+01C3 ǃ LATIN LETTER RETROFLEX CLICK and distinguished from the common punctuation symbol U+0021!EXCLAMATION MARK to allow software to deal properly with word breaks.

The exclamation mark has sometimes been used as a [phonetic symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonetic_notation "Phonetic notation") to indicate that a consonant is [ejective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejective_consonant "Ejective consonant"). More commonly, this is represented by an [apostrophe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe "Apostrophe"), or a [superscript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superscript "Superscript")[glottal stop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glottal_stop "Glottal stop") symbol (U+02C0 ˀ MODIFIER LETTER GLOTTAL STOP).

Although not part of dictionary words, exclamation marks appear in some [brand names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brand_names "Brand names") and [trade names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_name "Trade name"), including [Yum! Brands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yum!_Brands "Yum!

The [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England "England") town of [Westward Ho!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westward_Ho! "Westward Ho!"), named after [the novel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westward_Ho!_(novel) "Westward Ho! (novel)") by [Charles Kingsley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Kingsley "Charles Kingsley"), is the only place name in the United Kingdom that officially contains an exclamation mark.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-Eveleth-2012-8)[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-58) There is a town in [Quebec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec "Quebec") called [Saint-Louis-du-Ha!

New Zealand road sign warning of a "cattle stop" ([cattle grid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle_grid "Cattle grid")/cattle guard)

Exclamation marks are used to emphasize a [precautionary statement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precautionary_statement "Precautionary statement"). On [warning signs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warning_sign "Warning sign"), an exclamation mark is often used to draw attention to a warning of danger, hazards, and the unexpected.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-BBC-R4-14) These signs are common in hazardous environments or on potentially dangerous equipment. A common type of this warning is a yellow [triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle "Triangle") with a black exclamation mark, but a white triangle, with a red border is common on [European](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe "Europe")[road warning signs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warning_sign "Warning sign"). (In most cases, a pictogram indicating the nature of the hazard is enclosed in the triangle but an exclamation mark may be used instead as a generic symbol; a plate beneath identifies the hazard.)

The _[Zirkel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zirkel\_(Studentenverbindung) "Zirkel (Studentenverbindung)")_ monogram of a German _[Studentenverbindung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studentenverbindung "Studentenverbindung")_ includes an exclamation mark if the society is still active.

### Mathematics and formal logic

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Exclamation_mark&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: Mathematics and formal logic")]

In elementary [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), the symbol represents the [factorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial "Factorial") operation.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-Math_is_Fun-1) The expression n! means "the product of the [integers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integers "Integers") from 1 to n". For example, 4! (read _four factorial_) is 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24. (0! is defined as 1,[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-Math_is_Fun-1)[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-62) which is a [neutral element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutral_element "Neutral element") in [multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication "Multiplication"), not multiplied by anything.) Additionally, it can also represent the [uniqueness quantifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniqueness_quantification "Uniqueness quantification") or,[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-63) if used in front of a number, it can represent a [subfactorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subfactorial "Subfactorial").[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-64)

In [linear logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_logic "Linear logic"), the exclamation mark denotes one of the modalities that control weakening and contraction.

In [computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing "Computing"), the exclamation mark is [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII "ASCII")[character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(computing) "Character (computing)") 33 (21 in [hexadecimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal "Hexadecimal")). Due to its availability even on early computers, the character was used for many purposes. The name given to "!" by programmers varies according to their background, though it was very common to give it a short name to make reading code aloud easier. "Bang" is very popular.[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-hacker-65): 55  In the UK, the term [pling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pling "Pling") was popular in the earlier days of computing, whilst in the United States, the term [shriek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vociferation "Vociferation") was used. It is claimed that these word usages were invented in the US and _shriek_ is from [Stanford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford "Stanford") or [MIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT "MIT"); however, _shriek_ for the! sign is found in the _[Oxford English Dictionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford\_English\_Dictionary "Oxford English Dictionary")_ dating from the 1860s.

Many computer languages using [C-style syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_programming_language "C programming language") use "!" for [logical negation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negation#Programming_language_and_ordinary_language "Negation"); `!A` means "not A", and `A != B` means "A is [not equal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inequation "Inequation") to B". This negation principle has spread to ordinary language; for example, the word "!clue" is used as a synonym for "no-clue" or "clueless".[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-hacker-65): [18](https://web.archive.org/web/20230408040118/https://books.google.com/books?id=g80P_4v4QbIC&pg=PA18)[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-66) The symbol in formal logic for [negation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negation "Negation") is `¬` but, as this symbol is not present as standard on most keyboards, the C convention has spread informally to other contexts.

Early [e-mail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-mail "E-mail") systems also used the exclamation mark as a separator character between hostnames for routing information, usually referred to as "[bang path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bang_path "Bang path")" notation.

In the [IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat "Internet Relay Chat") protocol, a user's nickname and [ident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identifier "Identifier") are separated by an exclamation mark in the [hostmask](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostmask "Hostmask") assigned to him or her by the server.

In [UNIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIX "UNIX") scripting (typically for [UNIX shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIX_shell "UNIX shell") or [Perl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl "Perl")), "!" is usually used after a "#" in the first line of a script, the [interpreter directive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_directive "Interpreter directive"), to tell the OS what program to use to run the script. `#!` is usually called a "hash-bang" or [shebang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix) "Shebang (Unix)"). A similar convention for [PostScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript "PostScript") files calls for the first line to begin with `%!`, called "percent-bang".[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-67)

An exclamation mark starts [history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_history "Command history") expansions in many [Unix shells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell "Unix shell") such as [bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell) "Bash (Unix shell)") and [tcsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcsh "Tcsh") where `!!` executes the previous command and `!*` refers to all the arguments from the previous command.

[Acorn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acorn_Computers_Ltd "Acorn Computers Ltd")[RISC OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC_OS "RISC OS") uses filenames starting with pling to create an [application directory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_directory "Application directory"): for instance, a file called `!Run` is executed when the folder containing it is double-clicked (holding down shift prevents this). There is also `!Boot` (executed the first time the application containing it comes into view of the filer), `!Sprites` (icons), `!Help`, and others.

In [APL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_(programming_language) "APL (programming language)"), `!x` is used for the [factorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial "Factorial") of x (backwards from math notation), and also for the [binomial coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient "Binomial coefficient"): `k!n` means ![Image 6: {\displaystyle {\tbinom {n}{k}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/206415d3742167e319b2e52c2ca7563b799abad7) or _n_!⁄_k_!(_n_–_k_)!.

[BBC BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_BASIC "BBC BASIC") used the exclamation mark as an indirection operator, equivalent to [PEEK and POKE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEEK_and_POKE "PEEK and POKE") of four [bytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte "Byte") at once.[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-68)

[BCPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BCPL "BCPL"), the precursor of [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language) "C (programming language)"), used "!" for pointer and array indirection: `!P` is equivalent to `*P` in C, and `P!3` is equivalent to `P[3]` in C.

In the [Xbase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbase "Xbase") family of programming languages, which includes [dBase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBase "DBase") and [FoxPro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FoxPro "FoxPro"), an exclamation mark, when used as part of an expression, indicates negation. For example,!= means "not equal to". At the start of a line of code, it is a synonym for RUN (which executes an external program).[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-69)[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-70)

In the [Haskell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_(programming_language) "Haskell (programming language)") programming language, "!" is used to express strictness.

In the [Kotlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kotlin_(programming_language) "Kotlin (programming language)") programming language, "!!" ("double-bang") is the not-null assertion operator, used to override [null safety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Void_safety "Void safety") so as to allow a [null pointer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_pointer "Null pointer") exception.[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-71)

In the [ML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ML_(programming_language) "ML (programming language)") programming language (including [Standard ML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_ML "Standard ML") and [OCaml](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCaml "OCaml")), "!" is the operator to get the value out of a "reference" data structure.

In the [Raku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raku_(programming_language) "Raku (programming language)") programming language, the "!" [twigil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigil_(computer_programming) "Sigil (computer programming)") is used to access private attributes or methods in a class (like `class Person { has $!name; }` or `self!private-method;`).[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-72)

In the [Scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language) "Scheme (programming language)"),[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-73)[Julia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_(programming_language) "Julia (programming language)"),[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-74) and [Ruby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language) "Ruby (programming language)") programming languages, "!" is conventionally the suffix for functions and special forms that mutate their input.

In the [Swift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_(programming_language) "Swift (programming language)") programming language, a type followed by "!" denotes an "implicitly unwrapped optional", an [option type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_type "Option type") where the compiler does not enforce safe unwrapping. The "!" operator "force unwraps" an option type, causing an error if it is nil.

In [Geek Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geek_Code "Geek Code") version 3, "!" is used before a letter to denote that the geek refuses to participate in the topic at hand. In some cases, it has an alternate meaning, such as _G!_ denoting a geek of no qualifications, _!d_ denoting not wearing any clothes, _P!_ denoting not being allowed to use Perl, and so on. They all share some negative connotations, however.

`!` is used to denote changed lines in [`diff`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff "Diff") output in the [context format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff#Context_format "Diff"). In the [unified format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff#Unified_format "Diff"), changes to a single line are denoted as an addition and deletion.

The exclamation mark can be used in video games to signify that a character is startled or alarmed. In the _[Metal Gear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal\_Gear\_(series) "Metal Gear (series)")_ and _[Paper Mario](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper\_Mario "Paper Mario")_ series, an exclamation mark appears over enemies' heads when they notice the player.

In [massively multiplayer online (MMO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_game "Massively multiplayer online game") games such as _[World of Warcraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World\_of\_Warcraft "World of Warcraft")_, an exclamation mark hovering over a character's head is often used to indicate that they are offering a quest for the player to complete.

In _[Dota 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dota\_2 "Dota 2")_, an exclamation mark is shown above the head of a unit if it is killed by means not granting enemies experience or gold (if it is "denied").

In the 2005 arcade dance simulation game _[In the Groove 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In\_the\_Groove\_2 "In the Groove 2")_, there is a song titled "!" (also referred to as "bang") by the artist Onyx.

In [Internet culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet#Social_impact "Internet"), especially where [leet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet "Leet") is used, multiple exclamation marks may be affixed with the numeral "1", as in _!!!!!!111_. The notation originates from a common error: when typing multiple exclamation points quickly, the typist may fail to hold the ⇧ [Shift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift_key "Shift key")1 combination that produces the exclamation mark on many [keyboard layouts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_layout "Keyboard layout"). This error, first used intentionally as a joke in the leet linguistic community, is now an accepted form of exclamation in leet and derivative dialects such as [Lolspeak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lolcat "Lolcat").[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-75) Some utterances include further substitutions, for example "!!!111oneeleven".[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-76)[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-77)

In [fandom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fandom "Fandom") and [fanfiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fanfiction "Fanfiction"),! is used to signify a defining quality in a character, usually signifying an alternative interpretation of a character from a [canonical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_(fiction) "Canon (fiction)") work. Examples of this would be "Romantic!Draco" or "Vampire!Harry" from the _[Harry Potter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry\_Potter "Harry Potter")_ fandom. It is also used to clarify the current persona of a character with multiple identities or appearances, such as to distinguish "Armor![Al](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphonse_Elric "Alphonse Elric")" from "Human!Al" in a work based on _[Fullmetal Alchemist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fullmetal\_Alchemist "Fullmetal Alchemist")_. The origin of this usage is unknown, although it is hypothesized to have originated with certain _[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage\_Mutant\_Ninja\_Turtles "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles")_ action figures; for example, "Football Player! Leonardo", "Rockstar! Raphael", and "Breakdancer! Michelangelo".[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-78)[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-79)

[![Image 7](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d1/Action252.jpg/250px-Action252.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Action252.jpg)

This _[Action Comics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action\_Comics "Action Comics")_ cover from 1959 ends every sentence with an exclamation point or [question mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark "Question mark"). Often, few or no [periods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop "Full stop") would be used in the entire book.

Some [comic books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_book "Comic book"), especially [superhero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero "Superhero") comics of the mid-20th century, routinely use the exclamation point instead of the period,[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-BBC-R4-14) which means the character has just realized something; unlike when the question mark appears instead, which means the character is confused, surprised or they do not know what is happening. This tends to lead to exaggerated speech, in line with the other [hyperboles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbole "Hyperbole") common in comic books. A portion of the motivation, however, was simply that a period might disappear in the printing process used at the time, whereas an exclamation point would likely remain recognizable even if there was a printing glitch. For a short period, [Stan Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_Lee "Stan Lee"), as [editor-in-chief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor-in-chief "Editor-in-chief") of [Marvel Comics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics "Marvel Comics"), attempted to curb their overuse by a short-lived ban on exclamation marks altogether, which led to an inadvertent lack of ending punctuation in many sentences.[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-80)

Comic book writer [Elliot S! Maggin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliot_S._Maggin "Elliot S. Maggin") once accidentally signed his name with an exclamation due to the habit of using them when writing comic scripts; it became his professional name from then on.[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-81)[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-82) Similarly, comic artist [Scott Shaw!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Shaw_(artist) "Scott Shaw (artist)") has used the exclamation point after his name throughout his career.

In comic books and comics in general, a large exclamation point is often used near or over a character's head to indicate surprise. A [question mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark "Question mark") can similarly be used to indicate confusion.

In [chess notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_chess_notation "Algebraic chess notation"), ["!"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punctuation_(chess)#!:_Good_move "Punctuation (chess)") denotes a good move, ["!!"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punctuation_(chess)#%E2%80%BC:_Brilliant_move "Punctuation (chess)") denotes an excellent move, "?!" denotes a dubious move, and "!?" denotes an interesting, risky move. In some chess variants, such as large-board [Shogi variants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shogi_variant "Shogi variant"), "!" is used to record pieces captured by stationary feeding or burning.

In _[Scrabble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrabble "Scrabble")_, an exclamation mark written after a word is used to indicate its presence in the [Official Tournament and Club Word List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_Tournament_and_Club_Word_List "Official Tournament and Club Word List") but its absence from the _[Official Scrabble Players Dictionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official\_Scrabble\_Players\_Dictionary "Official Scrabble Players Dictionary")_, usually because the word has been judged offensive.

Exclamation points or [asterisks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk "Asterisk") can be used on scorecards to denote a "great defensive play".[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-83)

The band [!!!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/!!! "!!!") (pronounced "Chk Chk Chk") uses exclamation points as its name.[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-84)

In 2008, the pop-punk band [Panic! at the Disco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic!_at_the_Disco "Panic! at the Disco") dropped the exclamation point in its name; this became the "most-discussed topic on [fan] message boards around the world".[[76]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-85) In 2009, the exclamation mark was re-inserted following the band's split.[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-86)

The band [Bomb the Music Industry!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomb_the_Music_Industry! "Bomb the Music Industry!") utilizes an exclamation mark in its name, as well as several album and song titles and promotional material. Examples include their songs "(Shut) Up The Punx!!!" and the album _[Adults!!!: Smart!!! Shithammered!!! And Excited by Nothing!!!!!!!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adults!!!:\_Smart!!!\_Shithammered!!!\_And\_Excited\_by\_Nothing!!!!!!! "Adults!!!: Smart!!! Shithammered!!! And Excited by Nothing!!!!!!!")_.

American musician [Pink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_(singer) "Pink (singer)") stylizes her stage name "P!NK",[[78]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-87) and uses three exclamation points in the subtitle of her 2010 release, _[Greatest Hits... So Far!!!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest\_Hits...\_So\_Far!!! "Greatest Hits... So Far!!!")_.[[79]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-88)

The exclamation mark was included in the title of [Dinah Shore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinah_Shore "Dinah Shore")'s TV series, _[Dinah!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinah! "Dinah!")_ The exclamation mark was later the subject of a bitter argument between [Elaine Benes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elaine_Benes "Elaine Benes") and her boyfriend, Jake Jarmel, in the _[Seinfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinfeld "Seinfeld")_ episode, "[The Sniffing Accountant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sniffing_Accountant "The Sniffing Accountant")". Elaine got upset with Jake for not putting an exclamation mark at the end of a message about her friend having a baby. Jake took extreme exception to the trivial criticism and broke up with Elaine, putting an exclamation mark after his parting words: "I'm leaving!"[[80]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-89)

1.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_ref-3)**Other linguists suggest that the exclamation mark may have originated from a shortening of [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_language "Latin language"): _interiectiō_ [interjection].[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-2)
2.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_ref-5)**Speakers of [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin "Latin") likely derived _Io_ from the [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language "Greek language")_Iō_.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-Partridge-1953-4)

4.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_ref-11)**The transformation from _io_ to the exclamation mark was gradual. [[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#cite_note-Lobo-2021-6)
