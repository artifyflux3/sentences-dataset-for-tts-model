However, the El Niño pattern that was in place during that period weakened in April; the pattern shift caused the more traditional Tornado Alley zone to rapidly become extremely favorable for tornado outbreaks, and several large outbreaks occurred in late spring. In a month-long span between April 26 and May 26, almost 700 tornadoes touched down across the United States, causing widespread destruction and dozens of casualties. Average to above average activity continued through essentially the rest of the year as several derechos and multiple outbreaks spawned by tropical cyclones occurred across the United States. As a result, 2024 ended as the second most active year on record for tornadoes and the most active season of the 2020s decade so far, with 1,880 preliminary reports and at least 1,797 confirmed tornadoes. Only 2004 had more tornadoes with 1,817. This year surpassed 2019 as the busiest year ever recorded in Oklahoma , with at least 152 confirmed tornadoes.

[ 2 ] With a violent tornado occurring near Marietta in Oklahoma, 2024 was the first year since 2016 to feature an EF4 tornado in Oklahoma.

[ 3 ] Another EF4 tornado struck Barnsdall in northeast Oklahoma, marking it the first time since 2013 Oklahoma saw more than one violent tornado.

[ 4 ] 2024 was also the busiest year on record for tornadoes in Florida , Illinois , Iowa , New York , Ohio and West Virginia .

The longest-tracked and widest tornado of the outbreak touched down southwest of Graceville before it crossed into Alabama and struck Cottonwood at EF2 strength, unroofing homes, collapsing the walls of a brick business, and completely destroying a Moose Lodge building. One person was killed northeast of Cottonwood when the tornado obliterated a mobile home. Several more EF1 tornadoes also touched down in Georgia , South Carolina , and North Carolina , including a tornado that struck the eastern edge of Claremont, North Carolina and rolled a manufactured home, resulting in another fatality. The final significant tornado of the day was an EF2 tornado that struck Bamberg, South Carolina , where multiple historic brick buildings were destroyed, and a barrel factory suffered major damage. In all, 38 tornadoes were confirmed, resulting in two fatalities. Four additional fatalities unrelated to tornadoes occurred during the event as well.

[ 38 ] [ 39 ] [ 40 ] [ 41 ] March 2 (Uruguay) [ edit ] On Saturday March 2 of 2024 around 8:50 p.m. The city of Salto , Uruguay was affected by a tornado.
The tornado originated in the area of the "Costanera norte", starting its trajectory between the Rowers Club and the Salto Rowing Club. In this area, very significant damage was observed to trees, billboards, with signs of rotation and fall of power lines and light poles. A container was displaced. Some trees in the area were left without branches and shells. The most significant damage was concentrated in highschool No. 2 and a minimarket, part of the roof of the business was found about 5 blocks away. The phenomenon culminated in the area of Los Laureles neighborhood.
Eyewitness accounts, together with evidence of the typical tornado path and the characteristic damage observed in the affected objects, suggest that the tornado could be classified as an EF1. In areas where the tornado did not pass through, no significant damage was recorded, and even some areas of the city barely experienced any winds. This highlights the focused and destructive nature of the event. This analysis is based on the field work conducted, which included direct observation of the damage, photographic documentation and consultation with eyewitnesses.

From the evening of March 13 through March 15, a severe weather and tornado outbreak impacted the Central, Midwestern, and Southern United States. On March 13, the Storm Prediction Center issued an enhanced risk for severe weather across Kansas and Missouri. Two tornadoes touched down that day in Kansas, near Alta Vista and Rossville , both of which caused EF2 damage.

[ 55 ] On March 14, the Storm Prediction Center issued another enhanced risk area for parts of Texas , Oklahoma , Arkansas , and Missouri , including a 10% risk area for tornadoes. However, the most intense supercells formed northeast of that area in the Ohio Valley .

[ 56 ] That afternoon, a low-end EF2 tornado touched down in Hanover, Indiana , tearing the roofs off a few homes, before crossing into Kentucky and striking the town of Milton , destroying numerous trailers and causing damage to many homes. The tornado then re-entered Indiana and destroyed more trailers near Brooksburg before lifting. Two people were injured by this tornado.

[ 9 ] [ 57 ] That evening, a long-tracked supercell produced numerous tornadoes in Indiana and Ohio . The first tornado spawned by this supercell was a brief EF1 tornado near Celina , [ 58 ] [ 59 ] before another EF1 tornado directly struck Celina and the nearby community of St Marys .

[ 60 ] The supercell then spawned a multiple-vortex, high-end EF3 tornado that impacted the towns of Wapakoneta and Lakeview , destroying manufactured homes, uprooting and partially debarking trees, and obliterating RVs at a trailer park where a site-built structure was also destroyed. Three people were killed, and 26 others were injured by this tornado.

[ 61 ] Shortly thereafter, a separate supercell to the north of the Lakeview supercell produced an EF2 tornado that completely destroyed a manufactured home and damaged trees, homes, and outbuildings near Plymouth .

[ 62 ] After the Lakeview EF3 tornado dissipated, the storm produced an EF2 tornado that caused major damage to homes, outbuildings, and trees as it passed near Raymond , through Broadway , and near Ostrander .

[ 63 ] The final tornado from the Lakeview supercell was a long-tracked EF1 tornado that passed near Delaware , Sunbury , Galena , and St. Louisville .

[ 64 ] Just south of the Lakeview supercell, another supercell spawned an EF2 tornado that impacted Selma, Indiana .

[ 65 ] [ 66 ] Later, the storm spawned another strong tornado near Farmland, Indiana , which tore the roofs off numerous homes as it moved eastward. The tornado then struck Winchester at high-end EF3 intensity, destroying many homes, a church, and a Taco Bell restaurant. The tornado then crossed the border into Ohio , causing EF1-EF2 damage to farmsteads as it moved through Darke and Miami counties before dissipating near Bradford . The tornado injured 40 people with one person dying from their injuries about a month later.

[ 9 ] [ 65 ] [ 67 ] [ 68 ] Further south, a low-end EF2 tornado destroyed a metal structure and snapped many trees in Hot Springs Village, Arkansas as well.

[ 70 ] In total, 34 tornadoes were confirmed from this outbreak along with four fatalities and 69 injuries.

March 19 (Argentina) [ edit ] EFU EF0 EF1 EF2 EF3 EF4 EF5 0 1 3 2 0 0 0 On Tuesday, March 19, 2024 in Buenos Aires , argentina, 2 tornadoes occurred in the district of Nueve de Julio followed by 4 other tornadoes in the district of Bragado, the most intense one recorded was the tornado that hit the town of Olascoaga [ es ] in the district of Bragado , It caused severe damage to silos, agricultural vehicles, homes and sheds located in the area, corresponding to those of a low-end EF2 tornado with winds that were recorded at up to 180 km/h (112 mph) although it is suspected that it may have actually generated winds of up to 200 km/h (124 mph).

[ 71 ] [ 72 ] [ 73 ] [ 74 ] [ 75 ] It moved at least 12 km from the west - northwest of Olascoaga to the east - southeast passing near and north of the town of Comodoro Py [ es ] also located in the district of Bragado.
At first it was believed that this was the only tornado produced, but days later in a preliminary report of the meteorological expertise made by meteorological observers Mauricio Senessi and Lucas Buscalia, confirmed that the phenomenon occurred previously further south, in the district and city of Nueve de Julio, It was also a tornado, which moved almost parallel to the subsequent Olascoaga-Comodoro Py tornado, also causing significant damage in the town of Nueve de Julio , destroying a racetrack east of that city and severely damaging several houses along the city.

[ 74 ] [ 73 ] But then, more than a month after the tornado event that affected the districts of Bragado and Nueve de Julio, the same observers of the meteorological expertise together with 2 other collaborators (contributing between them 2 a vehicle and stay to the meteorological observers) toured together both districts, concluding that day there were a total of 6 tornadoes between the districts of Bragado and Nueve de Julio: [ 75 ] It is not known if the tornadoes were caused by the same long-track supercell in a tornado family or by several contiguous supercells in a multicellular thunderstorm .
And although it is known that both the Olascoaga tornado and the one that affected the city of Nueve de Julio, generated winds between 110 - 124 mph and could be classified as EF2, the exact intensity of the other four tornadoes varies between EF0 and EF1.

March 21 (Brazil) [ edit ] In the early hours of Thursday, March 21, 2024, a tornado occurred in the municipality of São Sepé , Rio Grande do Sul . A house in the rural area of the municipality of São Sepé was completely destroyed and moved from its foundation.

A small severe weather outbreak produced numerous tornadoes along the Gulf Coast . On April 9, the Storm Prediction Center issued an enhanced risk of severe weather from Central Texas through western Louisiana , including a 10% risk for tornadoes. On April 10, the Storm Prediction Center issued a moderate risk for south-central Louisiana into southern Mississippi, with a 15% risk for strong tornadoes. During the very early morning of April 10, a squall line produced a brief EF1 tornado in Katy, Texas and another, stronger EF2 tornado in downtown Port Arthur . Afterwards, a quasi-linear convective system (QLCS) formed in eastern Texas, producing twin EF1 tornadoes south of Lake Charles and a damaging EF2 tornado near McNeese State University . The final significant tornado of the outbreak touched down near Lake Pontchartrain , causing EF2 damage on the southern side of Slidell and injuring several people in the area before it dissipated northwest of Pearlington as the tornado was absorbed by an EF1 tornado that moved through Northern Slidell before occluding into Stennis Space Center . Simultaneously, a long-track high-end EF1 tornado touched down in the southern side of Pearl River before striking Gainesville, Mississippi and the Stennis Space Center , causing moderate damage. In addition to the tornadoes that day, flooding near Pittsburgh led to a flash flood emergency .

[ 90 ] In total, 37 tornadoes were confirmed from the outbreak, with no fatalities and several injuries, as well as $1.5 billion in damages.

[ 91 ] [ 9 ] April 16–18 (United States) [ edit ] EFU EF0 EF1 EF2 EF3 EF4 EF5 7 22 19 2 0 0 0 A moderately severe weather outbreak produced numerous tornadoes across the Central Plains into the Midwest . On April 15, the Storm Prediction Center issued an enhanced risk into Kansas , Nebraska and South Dakota , with a 10% hatched tornado risk. On the morning of April 16, multiple supercells from the previous day produced several tornadoes across Iowa and Missouri. A long-lived EF1 tornado passed through the southeastern side of Eureka, Kansas , causing significant damage to barns. After this tornado dissipated, a supercell to the north produced three weak but long-tracked tornadoes southwest of Overbrook . The same cell produced a stronger EF2 tornado south of Virgil , which caused significant damage to barns and telephone poles. Later that morning, another enhanced risk was issued for Iowa , Illinois , and Missouri , with an additional 30% hatched risk for large hail. Only weak tornadoes touched down for most of the day, but the final one that day was a long-tracked, high-end EF2 tornado that touched down near Houghton before moving through rural areas near New London . This strong tornado, which was the strongest of the outbreak, caused severe damage at several houses' farmsteads near Yarmouth and uprooted numerous trees at Port Louisa National Wildlife Refuge before dissipating near Toolesboro . Weak tornadoes occurred over the next two days before the outbreak ended. In total, 50 tornadoes were confirmed from this outbreak, causing no injuries or fatalities.

On April 26, several lines of supercells impacted eastern Nebraska and western and central Iowa , producing widespread tornado damage. A large EF3 wedge tornado passed near Elba, Nebraska , causing major damage at a farmstead.

[ 94 ] Shortly after, a cyclic supercell produced a large EF3 tornado near Lincoln, Nebraska that struck an industrial building while 70 people were inside, resulting in the building's collapse and at least three non-fatal injuries. The tornado then derailed a BNSF freight train and crossed I-80 before dissipating.

[ 95 ] [ 96 ] After spawning some weak, short-lived tornadoes, the same storm produced a very large, violent low-end EF4 wedge tornado that touched down near Yutan, Nebraska and tracked through the northwestern Omaha metropolitan area and near Blair , prompting a tornado emergency .

[ 97 ] Significant damage was observed in Elkhorn from the tornado, with multiple homes being leveled and swept away with many other homes sustaining loss of roofs and collapsed walls.

[ 98 ] [ 99 ] More than 100 homes were destroyed and four people were injured.

[ 100 ] The Omaha Public Power District reported that the tornado outbreak left more than 10,000 homes without power, though half of those affected had power return by the following morning.

[ 101 ] Later, another storm produced an EF3 tornado that was documented by multiple surveillance cameras while passing through the east side of Council Bluffs, Iowa . The tornado then crossed the Missouri River and struck Omaha, Nebraska 's airport, Eppley Airfield , damaging or destroying several general aviation buildings.

[ 102 ] [ 103 ] The tornado then crossed back over the Missouri River and reached its peak intensity near Crescent, Iowa , destroying a home. The tornado continued to cause damage before dissipating near Beebeetown .

[ 104 ] Another long-tracked, very large high-end EF3 tornado struck Minden , prompting another tornado emergency. An estimated 40–50 homes were destroyed in Minden, where one person was killed and three others were injured.

[ 95 ] The tornado also caused damage near Tennant , Harlan , and Defiance before dissipating.

[ 105 ] That night, an EF2 tornado prompted another PDS warning for Pleasant Hill southeast of Des Moines . Major damage to homes occurred and one person was injured.

English Wikisource has original text related to this article: NOAA's finalized assessment for the Hollister, Oklahoma EF1 tornado On April 30, the Storm Prediction Center issued an Enhanced risk for severe weather in the states of Kansas , Missouri , and Nebraska , including a 5% risk for tornadoes. During the mid-afternoon, a low-precipitation supercell spawned an intense, multiple-vortex tornado that struck Westmoreland, Kansas , causing extensive damage to homes and businesses. Two poorly constructed frame homes were destroyed, and as a result, a low-end EF3 rating was applied, with wind speeds estimated at 140 mph (230 km/h). One fatality occurred in a destroyed mobile home as well.

[ 114 ] A photogenic tornado struck south of Vermillion, Kansas , heavily damaging one home at high-end EF1 intensity. In the early evening, a high-end EF1 tornado directly struck New Cordell, Oklahoma , damaging numerous homes and businesses. Later in the evening, a powerful supercell displayed an intense tornado vortex signature east of Hollister, Oklahoma . Given this tornado occurred in a rural area, the lack of damage indicators for it to hit led to a high-end EF1 rating. The tornado is believed to have been much more powerful than EF1 intensity, [ 115 ] and has been described as "one of the most powerful tornadoes ever to occur" by Oklahoma Country station KLAW , as well as certain meteorologists and storm chasers.

[ 116 ] The same supercell spawned an anticyclonic EF1 tornado southeast of Loveland , [ 117 ] [ 118 ] which was also believed to be more powerful than EF1 intensity [ 119 ] in contrast to most anti-cyclonic tornadoes, which are typically much weaker.

[ 120 ] An analysis of the Hollister and Loveland tornadoes by forecaster Trey Greenwood indicated that the Hollister tornado could have likely produced damage up to EF3 intensity, but stated that it was unlikely to have been a violent (EF4+) tornado, whereas the Loveland satellite tornado may have approached the intensity of the parent Hollister tornado and likely produced wind speeds in the range of 95–140 mph (153–225 km/h) while exhibiting a reversed hook echo .

[ 121 ] On May 1, multiple weak tornadoes touched down in and around Spearman, Texas ; an unrelated rare EF0 tornado also occurred in Puerto Rico .

[ 9 ] On May 2, the Storm Prediction Center issued an Enhanced risk for severe weather in the state of Texas, with a 5% risk for tornadoes. Numerous tornadoes touched down, the strongest being a "drill bit" high-end EF3 tornado that struck west of Hawley, Texas . Power poles and outbuildings sustained significant damage near the start of its path. As the tornado deviated south, it struck a poorly constructed home, sweeping it clean off its foundation. Another home, more well-constructed, was struck as the tornado continued to move south. All of its walls collapsed, with debris partially swept off the foundation. All four occupants sustained injuries.

[ 122 ] Vehicles were thrown and severely damaged as well. On May 3, the Storm Prediction Center issued yet another Enhanced risk for severe weather. Several tornadoes touched down throughout the day, including an EF2 tornado south of Silver, Texas and a deviant low-end EF3 wedge tornado south of Robert Lee .

[ 123 ] The storms have also been associated with severe flooding in Texas , which resulted in at least 224 people being rescued from their homes and vehicles in Harris County by May 3.

[ 124 ] BNSF 's Fort Worth Subdivision was closed for a few days after severe flooding caused a washout near Clifton ; [ 125 ] it was later closed again when the first train to go over the line after it reopened derailed.

[ 126 ] Amtrak 's Texas Eagle was forced to operate a bus bridge between San Antonio and Fort Worth, Texas and later between Temple and Fort Worth.

[ 127 ] Five more tornadoes touched down south of Fort Stockton, Texas on May 4. They generally moved over rural, inaccessible open terrain, but one of them was rated EF2 tornado due to snapping power poles; the others were rated EFU. Another EF2 tornado caused considerable damage on a ranch in Crockett County . One other EFU tornado also occurred in Ohio that day.

[ 9 ] In all, 51 tornadoes were confirmed.

Another large and deadly tornado outbreak occurred across the Great Plains , Mississippi Valley , and the Ohio Valley from May 6–10. On May 6, a tornado-driven high risk was issued by the Storm Prediction Center across central, north central, and, later, northeastern Oklahoma and south central Kansas , highlighting a 30 percent significant tornado probability over the High Risk area. However, throughout the day, only weak tornadoes occurred across the Plains. A separate system also spawned severe thunderstorms in Tennessee , including one that produced an EF1 tornado that moved through Smithville . Later that night, a powerful supercell spawned a violent EF4 tornado southeast of Hominy, Oklahoma . The tornado moved northeastward and struck the community of Barnsdall , prompting the issuance of a tornado emergency . Two people were killed within the town, and many homes and other structures were heavily damaged or destroyed, including some that were leveled. The tornado continued northeast and moved into Bartlesville, Oklahoma , causing additional severe damage before dissipating northeast of the town.

[ 128 ] [ 129 ] [ 130 ] Through the overnight hours into May 7, a squall line produced widespread damaging winds and isolated weak tornadoes across all of Missouri .

[ 131 ] On May 7, a tornado-driven Enhanced risk was issued across the Ohio Valley by the Storm Prediction Center . That afternoon, a strong, high-end EF2 tornado caused severe damage in Portage, Michigan . Later, a large EF2 tornado along with a satellite EF1 tornado prompted the issuance of a tornado emergency for Union City and Sherwood , the first tornado emergency ever issued in the state of Michigan. Other tornadoes were reported across Michigan along with Ohio , West Virginia , Indiana , Arkansas , and Pennsylvania through the overnight hours into May 8.

[ 132 ] EF3 damage to a house near Columbia, Tennessee .

Later on May 8, more severe weather and tornadoes impacted much of the Middle Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys with many areas experiencing multiple rounds of storms. PDS tornado warnings were issued for EF1 tornadoes near Equality, Illinois and Aurora, Missouri . A tornado emergency was issued for a large, low-end EF3 tornado east of Columbia, Tennessee ; a fatality and four injuries have been confirmed with this tornado.

[ 133 ] Later in the evening, an intense, low-end EF3 tornado crossed Wheeler Lake southeast of Rogersville, Alabama and came ashore in the Bridgadoon subdivision. It damaged several homes, including one large home that sustained significant damage. That night, another PDS tornado warning was issued when the same storm that produced the Brigadoon tornado spawned a strong EF2 tornado in Huntsville, Alabama ; the same storm later produced another destructive low-end EF3 tornado that prompted the issuance of another tornado emergency for Henagar , Hammondville , and Mentone . Strong straight-line winds blew a tree down on a car east of Lone Mountain, Tennessee , killing the driver.

[ 134 ] Severe storms also forced a Major League Baseball game at Busch Stadium to be postponed until August 5.

[ 135 ] More isolated tornadic activity occurred on May 9, but widespread reports of wind damage and large to very large hail were recorded throughout the Deep South . Through the overnight hours into May 10, a severe MCS moved through the southern Gulf Coast, producing widespread wind damage.

[ 136 ] The MCS would produce an EF2 tornado northeast of Pensacola, Florida before spawning three large tornadoes that simultaneously impacted Leon County, Florida . The two northern-most tornadoes, which were both rated low-end EF2, moved directly through Tallahassee , inflicting major damage to the downtown area as well as on the campuses of Florida State University and Florida A&M University . The second of these tornadoes also killed two people. To the south of these tornadoes, a swath of significant straight-line winds of around 100 mph (160 km/h) caused damage in the southern part of Tallahassee and points east. The third tornado, which was rated high-end EF1, passed south of Tallahassee, producing widespread tree damage.

[ 136 ] [ 137 ] Tornadic activity then ceased, but severe weather continued to impact the Southeastern United States until the system finally pushed offshore early on May 11.

[ 138 ] In all, 179 tornadoes, five tornadic fatalities, and three non-tornadic fatalities were confirmed from this outbreak.

[ 139 ] May 10 (Australia) [ edit ] A tornado struck the town of Bunbury , damaging around 100 homes, including seven that were declared uninhabitable, and injuring two people. Its wind speeds were estimated at over 150 km/h.

[ 256 ] [ 257 ] Research on tornadoes [ edit ] Main article: History of tornado research § 2024 In April 2024: In mid-April, the National Severe Storms Laboratory along with Texas Tech University begin the Low-Level Internal Flows in Tornadoes (LIFT) Project, with the goal to collect data from the “damage layer” of tornadoes; from ground level to 20 m (22 yd) above the surface. The LIFT project deployed 11 times between April–June, gathering data from "numerous successful intercepts".

[ 258 ] On April 26, a Doppler on Wheels (DOW) mobile radar truck measured 1-second wind speeds of approximately 224 mph (360 km/h) at a height of ~282 yards (258 m) as a tornado passed near Harlan, Iowa , after causing damage in the community of Minden .

[ 259 ] [ 260 ] In May 2024: On May 21, a violent EF4 tornado struck the town of Greenfield, Iowa . As the tornado moved through the town, a Doppler on Wheels measured winds of at least >250 mph (400 km/h), "possibly as high as 290 mph (470 km/h)" at 48 yards (44 m) above the surface.

[ 261 ] Pieter Groenemeijer, the director of the European Severe Storms Laboratory, noted that "on the IF-scale , 250 mph measured below 60 m above ground level is IF4 on the IF-scale, 290 mph is IF5." [ 262 ] The peak wind speed estimate was revised to between 309 mph (497 km/h) and 318 mph (512 km/h), a figure "among the highest wind speeds ever determined using DOW data", on June 22, 2024.

[ 263 ] A few weeks after the Greenfield tornado, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration released details about an experimental warning system which was tested before and during the tornado. This new warning system, named Warn-on-Forecast System (WoFS), was created by the Hazardous Weather Testbed housed in the National Weather Center in Norman, Oklahoma . During the experiment and test, the WoFS gave a high indication of “near-ground rotation” in and around the area of Greenfield, Iowa between 2-4 p.m. According to the press release, 75-minutes later, the violent EF4 tornado touched down. Scientists with the National Severe Storms Laboratory were able to give local National Weather Service forecasters a 75-minute lead time for the tornado.

[ 264 ] In September 2024: Researchers with the ERATOSTHENES Centre of Excellence, the Cyprus University of Technology , the Harz University of Applied Studies , the Leibniz-Institut für Troposphärenforschung [ de ] , and the Cyprus Department of Meteorology, published a case study on the 2024 Cyprus IF1.5 tornado on February 14, 2024 . In their study, the researchers published about how the Atmospheric Remote Sensing Observatory (CARO), located 10 km (6.2 mi) away from the tornado in the city of Limassol , recorded a vertical wind speed of 10 m/s (22 mph) as well as an instantaneous rate of rain from the storm of 90 millimetres per hour (3.5 in/h).
