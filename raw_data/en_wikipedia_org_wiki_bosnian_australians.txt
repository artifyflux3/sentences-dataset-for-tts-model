The first period occurred in the aftermath of World War II , and the second occurred in the late 1960s/early 1970s following an economic depression and open border policy in the former Yugoslavia .

[ 1 ] Bosnian migrants who arrived in Australia in the 1960s made important contributions to modern-day Australia through their role in the construction of the Snowy Mountains Scheme in New South Wales .

[ 2 ] The most recent wave of migration was during the 1990s when many Bosnians sought refuge from the Bosnian War . This migration was assisted under the refugee scheme of the Australian Red Cross .

By 1996, a year after the Bosnian War had ended, almost 14,000 migrants from Bosnia and Herzegovina were living in Australia. Most of the new arrivals settled in Victoria and Bosnia and Herzegovina was the fifth-largest source of migrants to Victoria in 1995-96.

By 2011, Victoria was home to 8,486 people from Bosnia and Herzegovina, with a predominant concentration in the Dandenong area.

Demographics [ edit ] The majority of Bosnians reside in the south-east and west of Melbourne , south-west of Sydney and the southside of Brisbane . The Bosnian community in Queensland is more widely distributed in regional cities with a significant community on the Gold Coast and in Bundaberg , Rockhampton , Cairns and Mareeba .

Distribution of Bosnian-born residents: State Number # Percentage of Bosnian-born community Victoria 9,193 35.1% New South Wales 7,639 29.2% Queensland 3,626 13.9% Western Australia 2,964 11.3% South Australia 2,193 8.4% Bosnian established mosques can be found in Deer Park (VIC) , Noble Park (VIC) , Penshurst (NSW) , Smithfield (NSW) , Wetherill Park (NSW) , Eight Mile Plains (QLD) , Southport (QLD) and Caversham (WA) .

[ 3 ] The main ethnic groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina , Bosniaks , Serbs and Croats are also represented in Australia among those born in BiH.

[ 4 ] Ancestry Number # Percentage of Bosnian-born community Bosniak (Bosnian Muslim) 13,955 53.3% Serbian 6,868 26.2% Croatian 5,142 19.6% Australian 500 1.9% The percentage of residents born in Bosnia and Herzegovina that have Australian citizenship is considerably higher than most other ethnic groups at 95%. Most communities that escaped war and came to Australia as refugees have higher citizenship rates and this could be attributed to the Bosnian Australian community as well.

[ 4 ] Media [ edit ] The SBS broadcasts a Bosnian-language program on SBS Radio 2 from 2 PM every Tuesday and a repeat from 3 PM on Sunday. It also broadcasts BHT1 Dnevnik news program every Friday morning from 8 AM to 8:30 AM as part of its WorldWatch programming block.

Other community radio stations such as 3ZZZ (Melbourne), 4EB (Brisbane), 6EBA-FM (Perth), 2000FM (Sydney), VOX FM (Wollongong), 1CMS (Canberra), 5EBI (Adelaide) also broadcast in Bosnian.

Language [ edit ] In Sydney there are 5 Saturday schools for Bosnian Australian youths.
