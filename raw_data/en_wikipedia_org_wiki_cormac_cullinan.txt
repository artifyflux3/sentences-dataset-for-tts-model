He is a director of the leading South African environmental law firm , Cullinan & Associates Inc, [ 1 ] and director of the Wild Law Institute [ 2 ] which pioneers eco-centric laws and governance systems. He has worked on environmental law and policy and the rights of Nature in more than 25 countries. He lives in Cape Town .

Early life and education [ edit ] Cullinan was born in Pietermaritzburg , South Africa , and educated at Maritzburg College and the University of Natal (now University of KwaZulu Natal ) where he graduated with Bachelors of Arts , Bachelor of Arts (Honours) in English literature, and Bachelor of Laws degrees. He has a Masters of Laws (environmental) from King’s College , University of London .

Earth Jurisprudence and Rights of Nature [ edit ] Inspired by Thomas Berry ’s ten principles for the revision of jurisprudence , Cullinan published Wild Law: a manifesto for Earth Justice (2002). Wild Law was the first book to use and define the term “ Earth Jurisprudence ” which is now central to the United Nations Living in Harmony with Nature Programme. Cullinan authored the chapter on Earth Jurisprudence in the second edition of the Oxford Handbook on International Environmental Law [ 3 ] (2021).  Earth jurisprudence is taught in Universities in many countries and several books have been published on the subject of Wild Law .

Cullinan played a leading role in the drafting of the Universal Declaration of the Rights of Mother Earth [ 4 ] (adopted in 2010 by a Peoples’ World Congress on Climate Change in Bolivia ) and co-founded the Global Alliance for Rights of Nature (GARN) [ 5 ] in Ecuador in 2010. Cullinan drafted the Peoples’ Convention that established the International Tribunal on the Rights of Nature and presided over the hearing of the Tribunal in Paris (2015) and the hearings of the European Tribunal in Defense of the Aquatic Ecosystems [ 6 ] (2021).

In 2022 he co-founded the Antarctic Rights Initiative [ 7 ] and prepared the first draft Antarctica Declaration.

[ 8 ] He co-founded the Biodiversity Law Centre [ 9 ] and in 2025 the Wild Law Institute began an initiative to recognise the Table Mountain range as a legal subject . Cullinan is a member of the executive committee of GARN, and the Antarctic Rights working group.

Cullinan has addressed conferences throughout the world on Earth Jurisprudence and the rights of Nature, including the UN General Assembly in 2011.

Life and career [ edit ] As a student in South Africa, Cullinan was president of the Students’ Representative Council, and became an anti-apartheid activist. He was a founder member and first chairperson of the Durban Democratic Alliance, a member of the United Democratic Front (UDF) that led the “above ground” struggle against apartheid in South Africa.  Cullinan began his legal career as a shipping attorney in Durban before working as a commercial and tax lawyer in Luxembourg and London . After completing an LLM (environmental law), he founded the environmental governance consultancy EnAct International, [ 10 ] in London, which worked in more than 40 countries. In 1999, he returned to South Africa and now heads both South Africa’s oldest specialist environmental law firm and the Wild Law Institute.

Awards and recognitions [ edit ] In 2025, Cullinan was awarded the Shackleton Medal [ 11 ] for his work and efforts to protect the Polar Regions. In 2021, he won the Nicke Steele award for the South African environmentalist of the year and in 2018 received the Enviropaedia Ecologic lifetime achievement award.

[ 12 ] In 2016, Cullinan was included in Warrior Lawyers: From Manila to Manhattan, Attorneys for the Earth. In 2008, he was listed among the world's most extraordinary environmental champions in Planet Savers: 301 Extraordinary Environmentalists , [ 13 ] which lists 301 people in history to be commended for their important role in saving and conserving the environment and promoting sustainable governance.
