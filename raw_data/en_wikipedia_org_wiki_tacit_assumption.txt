These assumptions may be made based on personal life experiences, and are not consciously apparent in the decision making environment. These assumptions can be the source of apparent paradoxes , misunderstandings and resistance to change in human organizational behavior .

[ citation needed ] Tacit assumptions in science often include the elegance of natural laws, and the applicability of mathematics .
