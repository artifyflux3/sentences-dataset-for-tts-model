[ citation needed ] In 1814 as part of the Portuguese Empire , Brazil adopted the new Portuguese metric system, which was based in the original metric system , but with its units having Portuguese traditional names. This system was not, however, widely adopted and was soon abandoned, with the Portuguese customary units continuing to be used.

[ citation needed ] In 1862 the metric system finally became compulsory in Brazil, [ 1 ] [ 2 ] and consolidated in 1972.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] Pre-metric units [ edit ] A number of units were used with local variations.

[ 1 ] Length [ edit ] A number of different units were used in Brazil to measure length. One pé (foot) was equal to 0.33 m (with local variations). Some of other units are given below: [ 1 ] [ 5 ] 1 polegada (inch) = 1 ⁄ 12 pé [ 5 ] 1 palmo (palm) = 2 ⁄ 3 pé 1 vara (yard) = 3 + 1 ⁄ 3 pés 1 passo geométrico (pace) = 5 pés 1 braça (fathom) = 6 + 2 ⁄ 3 pés 1 légua (league) = 20,000 pés.

Mass [ edit ] A number of different units were used in Brazil to measure mass. One libra (pound) was equal to 459.05 g (with local variations).  Some of other units are given below : [ 1 ] [ 5 ] 1 onça (ounce) = 1 ⁄ 16 libra 1 marco (mark) = 1/2 libra 1 arroba = 32 libras (One arroba métrica is equal to 15 kg. In Santos market Exchange, one arroba was 10 kg.

[ 6 ] ) 1 quintal (hundredweight) = 128 libras 1 tonelada (ton) = 1,728 libras .

The quilate (karat) used to measure to mass of gems was equal to 3.075 grains, and the outava used to measure mass of topazes was 57.17 grains.

[ 7 ] Area [ edit ] Different units were used to measure area in Brazil, often with significant local variations. One tarefa was equal to 3,000–4,000 m 2 . One alqueire was equal to 24,200 or 48,400 m 2 (it was equal to 8 salamis and it was 33 L in Minas Gerais [ 1 ] [ 6 ] ).

Volume [ edit ] A number of different units with notable local variations were used in Brazil. One almude was equal to 31.944 L.

[ 1 ] One alqueire was equal to 40 to 320 L (generally for grain 33 L [ 6 ] ) (According to some sources, 1 alqueire = 5.324 L, alqueir e (salt) = 4.076 L, 1 alqueire (common) = 3.626 L, 1 alqueire (Bahia) = 3.524 L, and 1 alqueire = 1/6 almude [ 5 ] ).

[ 1 ] Some of other units are provided below: [ 1 ] [ 5 ] 1 canada = 1 ⁄ 12 almude 1 moio = 10 almudes 1 pipa = 12 almudes 1 tonel = 30 almudes .
