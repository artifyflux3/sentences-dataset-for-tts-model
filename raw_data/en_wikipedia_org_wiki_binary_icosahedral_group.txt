It is an extension of the icosahedral group I or (2,3,5) of order 60 by the cyclic group of order 2, and is the preimage of the icosahedral group under the 2:1 covering homomorphism Spin ⁡ ⁡ ( 3 ) → → SO ⁡ ⁡ ( 3 ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Spin} (3)\to \operatorname {SO} (3)\,} of the special orthogonal group by the spin group . It follows that the binary icosahedral group is a discrete subgroup of Spin(3) of order 120.

It should not be confused with the full icosahedral group , which is a different group of order 120, and is rather a subgroup of the orthogonal group O(3).

In the algebra of quaternions , the binary icosahedral group is concretely realized as a discrete subgroup of the versors , which are the quaternions of norm one. For more information see Quaternions and spatial rotations .

Elements [ edit ] 120 quaternion elements seen in 12-fold projection. Element orders are given: 1,2,3,4,5,6,10 Explicitly, the binary icosahedral group is given as the union of all even permutations of the following vectors: 8 even permutations of ( ± ± 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 ) {\displaystyle (\pm 1,0,0,0)} 16 even permutations of ( ± ± 1 / 2 , ± ± 1 / 2 , ± ± 1 / 2 , ± ± 1 / 2 ) {\displaystyle (\pm 1/2,\pm 1/2,\pm 1/2,\pm 1/2)} 96 even permutations of ( 0 , ± ± 1 / 2 , ± ± 1 / 2 ϕ ϕ , ± ± ϕ ϕ / 2 ) {\displaystyle (0,\pm 1/2,\pm 1/2\phi ,\pm \phi /2)} Here ϕ ϕ = 1 + 5 2 {\displaystyle \phi ={\frac {1+{\sqrt {5}}}{2}}} is the golden ratio .

In total there are 120 elements, namely the unit icosians . They all have unit magnitude and therefore lie in the unit quaternion group Sp(1).

The 120 elements in 4-dimensional space match the 120 vertices the 600-cell , a regular 4-polytope .

Properties [ edit ] Central extension [ edit ] The binary icosahedral group, denoted by 2 I , is the universal perfect central extension of the icosahedral group, and thus is quasisimple : it is a perfect central extension of a simple group .

[ 2 ] Explicitly, it fits into the short exact sequence 1 → → { ± ± 1 } → → 2 I → → I → → 1.

{\displaystyle 1\to \{\pm 1\}\to 2I\to I\to 1.\,} This sequence does not split , meaning that 2 I is not a semidirect product of { ±1 } by I . In fact, there is no subgroup of 2 I isomorphic to I .

The center of 2 I is the subgroup { ±1 }, so that the inner automorphism group is isomorphic to I . The full automorphism group is isomorphic to S 5 (the symmetric group on 5 letters), just as for I ≅ ≅ A 5 {\displaystyle I\cong A_{5}} - any automorphism of 2 I fixes the non-trivial element of the center ( − − 1 {\displaystyle -1} ), hence descends to an automorphism of I, and conversely, any automorphism of I lifts to an automorphism of 2 I, since the lift of generators of I are generators of 2 I (different lifts give the same automorphism).

Superperfect [ edit ] The binary icosahedral group is perfect , meaning that it is equal to its commutator subgroup . In fact, 2 I is the unique perfect group of order 120. It follows that 2 I is not solvable .

Further, the binary icosahedral group is superperfect , meaning abstractly that its first two group homology groups vanish: H 1 ( 2 I ; Z ) ≅ ≅ H 2 ( 2 I ; Z ) ≅ ≅ 0.

{\displaystyle H_{1}(2I;\mathbf {Z} )\cong H_{2}(2I;\mathbf {Z} )\cong 0.} Concretely, this means that its abelianization is trivial (it has no non-trivial abelian quotients) and that its Schur multiplier is trivial (it has no non-trivial perfect central extensions). In fact, the binary icosahedral group is the smallest (non-trivial) superperfect group.

[ citation needed ] The binary icosahedral group is not acyclic , however, as H n (2 I , Z ) is cyclic of order 120 for n = 4 k +3, and trivial for n > 0 otherwise, ( Adem & Milgram 1994 , p. 279).

Isomorphisms [ edit ] Concretely, the binary icosahedral group is a subgroup of Spin(3), and covers the icosahedral group, which is a subgroup of SO(3). Abstractly, the icosahedral group is isomorphic to the symmetries of the 4- simplex , which is a subgroup of SO(4), and the binary icosahedral group is isomorphic to the double cover of this in Spin(4). Note that the symmetric group S 5 {\displaystyle S_{5}} does have a 4-dimensional representation (its usual lowest-dimensional irreducible representation as the full symmetries of the ( n − − 1 ) {\displaystyle (n-1)} -simplex), and that the full symmetries of the 4-simplex are thus S 5 , {\displaystyle S_{5},} not the full icosahedral group (these are two different groups of order 120).

[ citation needed ] The binary icosahedral group can be considered as the double cover of the alternating group A 5 , {\displaystyle A_{5},} denoted 2 ⋅ ⋅ A 5 ≅ ≅ 2 I ; {\displaystyle 2\cdot A_{5}\cong 2I;} this isomorphism covers the isomorphism of the icosahedral group with the alternating group A 5 ≅ ≅ I , {\displaystyle A_{5}\cong I,} .
Just as I {\displaystyle I} is a discrete subgroup of S O ( 3 ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {SO} (3)} , 2 I {\displaystyle 2I} is a discrete subgroup of the double over of S O ( 3 ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {SO} (3)} , namely S p i n ( 3 ) ≅ ≅ S U ( 2 ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {Spin} (3)\cong \mathrm {SU} (2)} .  The 2-1 homomorphism from S p i n ( 3 ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {Spin} (3)} to S O ( 3 ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {SO} (3)} then restricts to the 2-1 homomorphism from 2 I {\displaystyle 2I} to I {\displaystyle I} .

One can show that the binary icosahedral group is isomorphic to the special linear group SL(2,5) — the group of all 2×2 matrices over the finite field F 5 with unit determinant; this covers the exceptional isomorphism of I ≅ ≅ A 5 {\displaystyle I\cong A_{5}} with the projective special linear group PSL(2,5).

Note also the exceptional isomorphism P G L ( 2 , 5 ) ≅ ≅ S 5 , {\displaystyle PGL(2,5)\cong S_{5},} which is a different group of order 120, with the commutative square of SL, GL, PSL, PGL being isomorphic to a commutative square of 2 ⋅ ⋅ A 5 , 2 ⋅ ⋅ S 5 , A 5 , S 5 , {\displaystyle 2\cdot A_{5},2\cdot S_{5},A_{5},S_{5},} which are isomorphic to subgroups of the commutative square of Spin(4), Pin(4), SO(4), O(4).

Presentation [ edit ] The group 2 I has a presentation given by ⟨ ⟨ r , s , t ∣ ∣ r 2 = s 3 = t 5 = r s t ⟩ ⟩ {\displaystyle \langle r,s,t\mid r^{2}=s^{3}=t^{5}=rst\rangle } or equivalently, ⟨ ⟨ s , t ∣ ∣ ( s t ) 2 = s 3 = t 5 ⟩ ⟩ .

{\displaystyle \langle s,t\mid (st)^{2}=s^{3}=t^{5}\rangle .} Generators in the group of unit quaternions with these relations are given by s = 1 2 ( 1 + i + j + k ) t = 1 2 ( φ φ + φ φ − − 1 i + j ) .

{\displaystyle s={\tfrac {1}{2}}(1+i+j+k)\qquad t={\tfrac {1}{2}}(\varphi +\varphi ^{-1}i+j).} Subgroups [ edit ] Subgroups: • binary tetrahedral group : 2T =⟨2,3,3⟩ • 3 binary dihedral groups : Q 20 =⟨2,2,5⟩, Q 12 =⟨2,2,3⟩, Q 8 =⟨2,2,2⟩ • 3 binary cyclic groups : Z 10 =⟨5⟩, Z 6 =⟨3⟩, Z 4 =⟨2⟩ • 3 cyclic groups : Z 5 =(5), Z 3 =(3), Z 2 =(2) • 1 trivial group : ( ) The only proper normal subgroup of 2 I is the center { ±1 }.

By the third isomorphism theorem , there is a Galois connection between subgroups of 2 I and subgroups of I , where the closure operator on subgroups of 2 I is multiplication by { ±1 }.

− − 1 {\displaystyle -1} is the only element of order 2, hence it is contained in all subgroups of even order: thus every subgroup of 2 I is either of odd order or is the preimage of a subgroup of I .

Besides the cyclic groups generated by the various elements (which can have odd order), the only other subgroups of 2 I (up to conjugation) are: [ 3 ] binary dihedral groups , Dic 5 =Q20=⟨2,2,5⟩, order 20 and Dic 3 =Q12=⟨2,2,3⟩ of order 12 The quaternion group , Q8=⟨2,2,2⟩, consisting of the 8 Lipschitz units forms a subgroup of index 15, which is also the dicyclic group Dic 2 ; this covers the stabilizer of an edge.

The 24 Hurwitz units form an index 5 subgroup called the binary tetrahedral group ; this covers a chiral tetrahedral group . This group is self-normalizing so its conjugacy class has 5 members (this gives a map 2 I → → S 5 {\displaystyle 2I\to S_{5}} whose image is A 5 {\displaystyle A_{5}} ).

Relation to 4-dimensional symmetry groups [ edit ] The 4-dimensional analog of the icosahedral symmetry group I h is the symmetry group of the 600-cell (also that of its dual, the 120-cell ). Just as the former is the Coxeter group of type H 3 , the latter is the Coxeter group of type H 4 , also denoted [3,3,5]. Its rotational subgroup, denoted [3,3,5] + is a group of order 7200 living in SO(4) . SO(4) has a double cover called Spin(4) in much the same way that Spin(3) is the double cover of SO(3). Similar to the isomorphism Spin(3) = Sp(1), the group Spin(4) is isomorphic to Sp(1) × Sp(1).

The preimage of [3,3,5] + in Spin(4) (a four-dimensional analogue of 2 I ) is precisely the product group 2 I × 2 I of order 14400. The rotational symmetry group of the 600-cell is then [3,3,5] + = ( 2 I × 2 I ) / { ±1 }.

Various other 4-dimensional symmetry groups can be constructed from 2 I . For details, see (Conway and Smith, 2003).

Applications [ edit ] The coset space Spin(3) / 2 I = S 3 / 2 I is a spherical 3-manifold called the Poincaré homology sphere . It is an example of a homology sphere , i.e. a 3-manifold whose homology groups are identical to those of a 3-sphere . The fundamental group of the Poincaré sphere is isomorphic to the binary icosahedral group, as the Poincaré sphere is the quotient of a 3-sphere by the binary icosahedral group.
