In 1986, the diocese was suppressed and its territory incorporated into the diocese of Fano-Fossombrone-Cagli-Pergola . Up to 1563, the diocese had been directly subject to the papacy. It then became a suffragan of the archdiocese of Urbino .

[ 1 ] In 2000, Urbino lost its metropolitan status, and Fossombrone became part of the ecclesiastical province of Pesaro.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] History [ edit ] Map of diocese of Fano-Fossombrone-Cagli-Pergola Christianity was introduced there, according to Ferdinando Ughelli , by Felicianus of Foligno , though not until after the baptism of Constantine the Great (337).

[ 4 ] The martyrologies mention several martyrs: Aquilinus, Geminus, Gelasius, Magnus and Donata, also a bishop, Timothy, and his daughter (4 February), but these persons belong elsewhere, [ 5 ] and were not honored in Fossombrone until the late 16th century.

[ 6 ] The first bishop of certain date is Innocent, who was present at the synods of Pope Symmachus (504).

[ 7 ] In 558, there was trouble with the papacy, due to the intrusion of a person called Paulinus.

Pope Pelagius I wrote to the Magister Militum Joannes to have the pseudoepiscopus Paulinus taken into custody. In another letter to the Illustri Viator and Pancratius, he ordered that Paulinus be taken to a monastery, to which he had been relegated, as soon as possible. In a third letter, he ordered Basilius and Ocleantinus, who were defenders of Paulinus, to cease and desist from his cause. In a fourth letter, the pope requested Magister Joannes to bring Paulinus to him.

[ 8 ] Fossombrone was included in the Donation of Pepin , but remained subject to the Duchy of Spoleto [ 9 ] until 1198, when it passed under papal rule.

Pope Alexander II , in the bull "Cum in Dei" of 15 May 1054, defined the boundaries of the diocese.

[ 10 ] Pope Victor II (1055–1057) noticed the impoverished state of the diocese of Fossombrone, and gave the bishops the church of S. Giovanni in Sorbitulo with its income.

[ 11 ] Some of the property belonging to the church of Sorbitulo, the castle of Laureto, was subject to an attempt in 1182 by the Prior of Fons Avellana to acquire it; Pope Lucius III appointed three cardinals to investigate the claims, and then took the church under his protection.

[ 12 ] The diocese was then held in fief of the Holy See by different families: by the house of Este (1210–28), the Malatesta (1340-1445), the Montefeltro of Urbino , 1445-1631); from 1500 to 1503 it acknowledged the rule of Cesare Borgia .

[ 13 ] On 4 June 1563, Pope Pius IV signed the bull "Super Universas", by which he elevated the diocese of Urbino to the status of metropolitan archdiocese. He assigned as suffragan dioceses of the new ecclesiastical province Cagli, Sinigaglia, Pesaro, Fossombrone, Montefeltro, and Gubbio. Fossombrone was no longer directly dependent upon the papacy.

[ 14 ] The cathedral of Fossombrone is dedicated to the martyr Saint Maurentius [ 15 ] and to Bishop Aldobrandus. The cathedral had a Provost, a Theologus, a Penitentiarius and eleven canons.

[ 16 ] Bishop Lorenzo Landi (1612–1627) presided over a diocesan synod on 28 July 1619.

[ 17 ] Bishop Benedetto Landi (1628–1632) held a diocesan synod in 1629.

[ 18 ] Diocesan Reorganizations [ edit ] Following the Second Vatican Council , and in accordance with the norms laid out in the council's decree, Christus Dominus chapter 40, [ 19 ] Pope Paul VI ordered a reorganization of the ecclesiastical provinces in Italy. He ordered consultations among the members of the Congregation of Bishops in the Vatican Curia, the Italian Bishops Conference, and the various dioceses concerned.

[ 20 ] On 18 February 1984, the Vatican and the Italian State signed a new and revised concordat . Based on the revisions, a set of Normae was issued on 15 November 1984, which was accompanied in the next year, on 3 June 1985, by enabling legislation. According to the agreement, the practice of having one bishop govern two separate dioceses at the same time, aeque personaliter , was abolished. The Vatican continued consultations which had begun under Pope John XXIII for the merging of small dioceses, especially those with personnel and financial problems, into one combined diocese.

On 30 September 1986, Pope John Paul II ordered that the dioceses of Fano, Fossombrone, Cagli, and Pergola be merged into one diocese with one bishop, with the Latin title Dioecesis Fanensis-Forosemproniensis-Calliensis-Pergulana . The seat of the diocese was to be in Fano, whose cathedral was to serve as the cathedral of the merged diocese. The cathedrals in Fossombrone, Cagli and Pergola were to have the honorary titles of "co-cathedral"; the Chapters were each to be a Capitulum Concathedralis . There was to be only one diocesan Tribunal, in Fano, and likewise one seminary, one College of Consultors, and one Priests' Council. The territory of the new diocese was to include the territory of the suppressed dioceses. The new diocese was a suffragan of the archdiocese of Urbino.

[ 21 ] In 2000, Urbino lost its metropolitan status, and became, along with its former suffragans, part of the ecclesiastical province of Pesaro .

^ Christus Dominus 40. Therefore, in order to accomplish these aims this sacred synod decrees as follows: 1) The boundaries of ecclesiastical provinces are to be submitted to an early review and the rights and privileges of metropolitans are to be defined by new and suitable norms. 2) As a general rule all dioceses and other territorial divisions that are by law equivalent to dioceses should be attached to an ecclesiastical province. Therefore dioceses which are now directly subject to the Apostolic See and which are not united to any other are either to be brought together to form a new ecclesiastical province, if that be possible, or else attached to that province which is nearer or more convenient. They are to be made subject to the metropolitan jurisdiction of the bishop, in keeping with the norms of the common law. 3) Wherever advantageous, ecclesiastical provinces should be grouped into ecclesiastical regions for the structure of which juridical provision is to be made.
