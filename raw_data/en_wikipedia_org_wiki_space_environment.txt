**Space environment** is a branch of [astronautics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronautics "Astronautics"), [aerospace engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace_engineering "Aerospace engineering") and [space physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_physics "Space physics") that seeks to understand and address conditions existing in space that affect the design and operation of spacecraft. A related subject, [space weather](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_weather "Space weather"), deals with dynamic processes in the solar-terrestrial system that can give rise to effects on spacecraft, but that can also affect the atmosphere, [ionosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere "Ionosphere") and [geomagnetic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomagnetic_field "Geomagnetic field"), giving rise to several other kinds of effects on human technologies.

Effects on spacecraft can arise from [radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation "Radiation"), [space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris "Space debris") and [meteoroid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteoroid "Meteoroid") impact, upper [atmospheric drag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_drag "Atmospheric drag") and [spacecraft electrostatic charging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft_charging "Spacecraft charging"). Various mitigation strategies have been adopted.

Radiation in space usually comes from three main sources:

1.   The [Van Allen radiation belts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Allen_radiation_belt "Van Allen radiation belt")
2.   [Solar proton events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_particle_event "Solar particle event") and [solar energetic particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_energetic_particles "Solar energetic particles"); and
3.   Galactic [cosmic rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_ray "Cosmic ray").

For long-duration missions, the high doses of radiation can damage electronic components and solar cells. A major concern is also radiation-induced "single-event effects" such as [single-event upset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-event_upset "Single-event upset"). Crewed missions usually avoid the radiation belts and the [International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station "International Space Station") is at an altitude well below the most severe regions of the radiation belts. During solar energetic events ([solar flares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_flare "Solar flare") and [coronal mass ejections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronal_mass_ejection "Coronal mass ejection")) particles can be accelerated to very high energies and can reach the Earth in times as short as 30 minutes (but usually take some hours). These particles are mainly protons and heavier ions that can cause radiation damage, disruption to logic circuits, and even hazards to astronauts. Crewed missions to return to the Moon or to travel to Mars will have to deal with the major problems presented by solar particle events to radiation safety, in addition to the important contribution to doses from the low-level background [cosmic rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_ray "Cosmic ray"). In near-Earth orbits, the [Earth's magnetic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_magnetic_field "Earth's magnetic field") screens spacecraft from a large part of these hazards - a process called [geomagnetic shielding](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Geomagnetic_shielding&action=edit&redlink=1 "Geomagnetic shielding (page does not exist)").

Space debris and meteoroids can impact spacecraft at high speeds, causing mechanical or electrical damage. The average speed of space debris is 10 km/s (22,000 mph; 36,000 km/h)[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_environment#cite_note-1) while the average speed of meteoroids is much greater. For example, the meteoroids associated with the [Perseid meteor shower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perseids "Perseids") travel at an average speed of 58 km/s (130,000 mph; 210,000 km/h).[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_environment#cite_note-2) Mechanical damage from debris impacts have been studied through space missions including [LDEF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Duration_Exposure_Facility "Long Duration Exposure Facility"), which had over 20,000 documented impacts through its 5.7-year mission.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_environment#cite_note-3) Electrical anomalies associated with impact events include [ESA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Space_Agency "European Space Agency")'s Olympus spacecraft, which lost attitude control during the 1993 Perseid meteor shower.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_environment#cite_note-4) A similar event occurred with the [Landsat 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landsat_5 "Landsat 5") spacecraft[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_environment#cite_note-5) during the 2009 Perseid meteor shower.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_environment#cite_note-6)

Electrostatic charging
----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Space_environment&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Electrostatic charging")]

Spacecraft electrostatic charging is caused by the hot [plasma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics) "Plasma (physics)") environment around the Earth. The plasma encountered in the region of the [geostationary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary "Geostationary") orbit becomes heated during geomagnetic [substorms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substorm "Substorm") caused by disturbances in the solar wind. "Hot" electrons (with energies in the kilo-[electron volt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_volt "Electron volt") range) collect on surfaces of spacecraft and can establish electrostatic potentials of the order of kilovolts. As a result, discharges can occur and are known to be the source of many spacecraft anomalies.

Mitigation strategies
---------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Space_environment&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Mitigation strategies")]

Solutions devised by scientists and engineers include, but are not limited to, spacecraft shielding, special "[hardening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_hardening "Radiation hardening")" of electronic systems, various collision detection systems. Evaluation of effects during spacecraft design includes application of various models of the environment, including radiation belt models, spacecraft-plasma interaction models and atmospheric models to predict drag effects encountered in lower orbits and during reentry.

The field often overlaps with the disciplines of [astrophysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics "Astrophysics"), [atmospheric science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_science "Atmospheric science"), [space physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_physics "Space physics"), and [geophysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics "Geophysics"), albeit usually with an emphasis on application.

The United States government maintains a [Space Weather Prediction Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Weather_Prediction_Center "Space Weather Prediction Center") at [Boulder, Colorado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boulder,_Colorado "Boulder, Colorado"). The Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) is part of the [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration "National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration") ([NOAA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOAA "NOAA")). SWPC is one of the [National Weather Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Weather_Service "National Weather Service")'s (NWS) [National Centers for Environmental Prediction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Centers_for_Environmental_Prediction "National Centers for Environmental Prediction") (NCEP).

[Environmental law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_law "Environmental law") in [space law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_law "Space law") is being considered but lacks establishment,[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_environment#cite_note-v279-7) but has become an issue in light of increased [space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris "Space debris").[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_environment#cite_note-x023-8)

Space environmentalism
----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Space_environment&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Space environmentalism")]

Space environmentalism is an advocacy that sees space as not devoid of needing regulation and protection, and has gained attention by an increasing number of academics,[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_environment#cite_note-Lawrence_Rawls_Jah_Boley_2022_pp._428%E2%80%93435-9) such as [Moriba Jah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moriba_Jah "Moriba Jah").[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_environment#cite_note-Wood_2021-10)
