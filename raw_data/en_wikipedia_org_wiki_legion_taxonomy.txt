Intermediate minor rankings are not shown.

The legion , in biological classification , is a non-obligatory taxonomic rank within the Linnaean hierarchy sometimes used in zoology .

Taxonomic rank [ edit ] In zoological taxonomy , the legion is: subordinate to the class superordinate to the cohort .

consists of a group of related orders Legions may be grouped into superlegions or subdivided into sublegions , and these again into infralegions .

Use in zoology [ edit ] Legions and their super/sub/infra groups have been employed in some classifications of birds and mammals . Full use is made of all of these (along with cohorts and supercohorts ) in, for example, McKenna and Bell's classification of mammals .
