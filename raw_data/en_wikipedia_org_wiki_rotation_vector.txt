The angle Œ∏ and axis unit vector e define a rotation, concisely represented by the rotation vector Œ∏ e .

In mathematics , the axis‚Äìangle representation parameterizes a rotation in a three-dimensional Euclidean space by two quantities: a unit vector e indicating the direction of an axis of rotation , and an angle of rotation Œ∏ describing the magnitude and sense (e.g., clockwise ) of the rotation about the axis . Only two numbers, not three, are needed to define the direction of a unit vector e rooted at the origin because the magnitude of e is constrained. For example, the elevation and azimuth angles of e suffice to locate it in any particular Cartesian coordinate frame.

By Rodrigues' rotation formula , the angle and axis determine a transformation that rotates three-dimensional vectors. The rotation occurs in the sense prescribed by the right-hand rule .

The rotation axis is sometimes called the Euler axis . The axis‚Äìangle representation is predicated on Euler's rotation theorem , which dictates that any rotation or sequence of rotations of a rigid body in a three-dimensional space is equivalent to a pure rotation about a single fixed axis.

It is one of many rotation formalisms in three dimensions .

Rotation vector [ edit ] The axis‚Äìangle representation is equivalent to the more concise rotation vector , also called the Euler vector (not to be confused with a vector of Euler angles ). In this case, both the rotation axis and the angle are represented by a vector codirectional with the rotation axis whose length is the rotation angle Œ∏ , Œ∏ Œ∏ = Œ∏ Œ∏ e .

{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\theta }}=\theta \mathbf {e} \,.} It is used for the exponential and logarithm maps involving this representation.

Many rotation vectors correspond to the same rotation. In particular, a rotation vector of length Œ∏ + 2 œÄM , for any integer M , encodes exactly the same rotation as a rotation vector of length Œ∏ . Thus, there are at least a countable infinity of rotation vectors corresponding to any rotation. Furthermore, all rotations by 2 œÄM are the same as no rotation at all, so, for a given integer M , all rotation vectors of length 2 œÄM , in all directions, constitute a two-parameter uncountable infinity of rotation vectors encoding the same rotation as the zero vector. These facts must be taken into account when inverting the exponential map, that is, when finding a rotation vector that corresponds to a given rotation matrix. The exponential map is onto but not one-to-one .

Example [ edit ] Say you are standing on the ground and you pick the direction of gravity to be the negative z direction. Then if you turn to your left, you will rotate ‚Å† -œÄ / 2 ‚Å† radians (or -90¬∞ ) about the -z axis. Viewing the axis-angle representation as an ordered pair , this would be ( a x i s , a n g l e ) = ( [ e x e y e z ] , Œ∏ Œ∏ ) = ( [ 0 0 ‚àí ‚àí 1 ] , ‚àí ‚àí œÄ œÄ 2 ) .

{\displaystyle (\mathrm {axis} ,\mathrm {angle} )=\left({\begin{bmatrix}e_{x}\\e_{y}\\e_{z}\end{bmatrix}},\theta \right)=\left({\begin{bmatrix}0\\0\\-1\end{bmatrix}},{\frac {-\pi }{2}}\right).} The above example can be represented as a rotation vector with a magnitude of ‚Å† œÄ / 2 ‚Å† pointing in the z direction, [ 0 0 œÄ œÄ 2 ] .

{\displaystyle {\begin{bmatrix}0\\0\\{\frac {\pi }{2}}\end{bmatrix}}.} Uses [ edit ] The axis‚Äìangle representation is convenient when dealing with rigid-body dynamics . It is useful to both characterize rotations , and also for converting between different representations of rigid body motion , such as homogeneous transformations [ clarification needed ] and twists.

When a rigid body rotates around a fixed axis , its axis‚Äìangle data are a constant rotation axis and the rotation angle continuously dependent on time .

Plugging the three eigenvalues 1 and e ¬± iŒ∏ and their associated three orthogonal axes in a Cartesian representation into Mercer's theorem is a convenient construction of the Cartesian representation of the Rotation Matrix in three dimensions.

Rotating a vector [ edit ] Main article: Rodrigues' rotation formula Rodrigues' rotation formula , named after Olinde Rodrigues , is an efficient algorithm for rotating a Euclidean vector, given a rotation axis and an angle of rotation. In other words, Rodrigues' formula provides an algorithm to compute the exponential map from s o ( 3 ) {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {so}}(3)} to SO(3) without computing the full matrix exponential.

If v is a vector in R 3 and e is a unit vector rooted at the origin describing an axis of rotation about which v is rotated by an angle Œ∏ , Rodrigues' rotation formula to obtain the rotated vector is v r o t = v + ( sin ‚Å° ‚Å° Œ∏ Œ∏ ) ( e √ó √ó v ) + ( 1 ‚àí ‚àí cos ‚Å° ‚Å° Œ∏ Œ∏ ) ( e √ó √ó ( e √ó √ó v ) ) .

{\displaystyle \mathbf {v} _{\mathrm {rot} }=\mathbf {v} +(\sin \theta )(\mathbf {e} \times \mathbf {v} )+(1-\cos \theta )(\mathbf {e} \times (\mathbf {e} \times \mathbf {v} ))\,.} For the rotation of a single vector it may be more efficient than converting e and Œ∏ into a rotation matrix to rotate the vector.

Relationship to other representations [ edit ] Further information: Charts on SO(3) There are several ways to represent a rotation. It is useful to understand how different representations relate to one another, and how to convert between them. Here the unit vector is denoted œâ instead of e .

Exponential map from ùî∞ùî¨(3) to SO(3) [ edit ] Further information: Matrix exponential , Orthogonal matrix , Lie algebra  ¬ß¬†Relation to Lie groups , and Rotation group SO(3) ¬ß¬†Exponential map The exponential map effects a transformation from the axis-angle representation of rotations to rotation matrices , exp : : s o ( 3 ) ‚Üí ‚Üí S O ( 3 ) .

{\displaystyle \exp \colon {\mathfrak {so}}(3)\to \mathrm {SO} (3)\,.} Essentially, by using a Taylor expansion one derives a closed-form relation between these two representations. Given a unit vector œâ œâ ‚àà ‚àà s o ( 3 ) = R 3 {\textstyle {\boldsymbol {\omega }}\in {\mathfrak {so}}(3)=\mathbb {R} ^{3}} representing the unit rotation axis, and an angle, Œ∏ ‚àà R , an equivalent rotation matrix R is given as follows, where K is the cross product matrix of œâ , that is, Kv = œâ √ó v for all vectors v ‚àà R 3 , R = exp ‚Å° ‚Å° ( Œ∏ Œ∏ K ) = ‚àë ‚àë k = 0 ‚àû ‚àû ( Œ∏ Œ∏ K ) k k !

= I + Œ∏ Œ∏ K + 1 2 !

( Œ∏ Œ∏ K ) 2 + 1 3 !

( Œ∏ Œ∏ K ) 3 + ‚ãØ ‚ãØ {\displaystyle R=\exp(\theta \mathbf {K} )=\sum _{k=0}^{\infty }{\frac {(\theta \mathbf {K} )^{k}}{k!}}=I+\theta \mathbf {K} +{\frac {1}{2!}}(\theta \mathbf {K} )^{2}+{\frac {1}{3!}}(\theta \mathbf {K} )^{3}+\cdots } Because K is skew-symmetric, and the sum of the squares of its above-diagonal entries is 1, the characteristic polynomial P ( t ) of K is P ( t ) = det( K ‚àí t I ) = ‚àí( t 3 + t ) . Since, by the Cayley‚ÄìHamilton theorem , P ( K ) = 0, this implies that K 3 = ‚àí ‚àí K .

{\displaystyle \mathbf {K} ^{3}=-\mathbf {K} \,.} As a result, K 4 = ‚Äì K 2 , K 5 = K , K 6 = K 2 , K 7 = ‚Äì K .

This cyclic pattern continues indefinitely, and so all higher powers of K can be expressed in terms of K and K 2 . Thus, from the above equation, it follows that R = I + ( Œ∏ Œ∏ ‚àí ‚àí Œ∏ Œ∏ 3 3 !

+ Œ∏ Œ∏ 5 5 !

‚àí ‚àí ‚ãØ ‚ãØ ) K + ( Œ∏ Œ∏ 2 2 !

‚àí ‚àí ‚ãØ ‚ãØ ) K 2 , {\displaystyle R=I+\left(\theta -{\frac {\theta ^{3}}{3!}}+{\frac {\theta ^{5}}{5!}}-\cdots \right)\mathbf {K} +\left({\frac {\theta ^{2}}{2!}}-{\frac {\theta ^{4}}{4!}}+{\frac {\theta ^{6}}{6!}}-\cdots \right)\mathbf {K} ^{2}\,,} that is, R = I + ( sin ‚Å° ‚Å° Œ∏ Œ∏ ) K + ( 1 ‚àí ‚àí cos ‚Å° ‚Å° Œ∏ Œ∏ ) K 2 , {\displaystyle R=I+(\sin \theta )\mathbf {K} +(1-\cos \theta )\mathbf {K} ^{2}\,,} by the Taylor series formula for trigonometric functions .

This is a Lie-algebraic derivation, in contrast to the geometric one in the article Rodrigues' rotation formula .

[ 1 ] Due to the existence of the above-mentioned exponential map, the unit vector œâ representing the rotation axis, and the angle Œ∏ are sometimes called the exponential coordinates of the rotation matrix R .

Log map from SO(3) to ùî∞ùî¨(3) [ edit ] Further information: Rotation group SO(3) and Infinitesimal transformation Let K continue to denote the 3¬†√ó¬†3 matrix that effects the cross product with the rotation axis œâ : K ( v ) = œâ √ó v for all vectors v in what follows.

To retrieve the axis‚Äìangle representation of a rotation matrix , calculate the angle of rotation from the trace of the rotation matrix : Œ∏ Œ∏ = arccos ‚Å° ‚Å° ( Tr ‚Å° ‚Å° ( R ) ‚àí ‚àí 1 2 ) {\displaystyle \theta =\arccos \left({\frac {\operatorname {Tr} (R)-1}{2}}\right)} and then use that to find the normalized axis, œâ œâ = 1 2 sin ‚Å° ‚Å° Œ∏ Œ∏ [ R 32 ‚àí ‚àí R 23 R 13 ‚àí ‚àí R 31 R 21 ‚àí ‚àí R 12 ] , {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\omega }}={\frac {1}{2\sin \theta }}{\begin{bmatrix}R_{32}-R_{23}\\R_{13}-R_{31}\\R_{21}-R_{12}\end{bmatrix}}~,} where R i j {\displaystyle R_{ij}} is the component of the rotation matrix, R {\displaystyle R} , in the i {\displaystyle i} -th row and j {\displaystyle j} -th column.

The axis-angle representation is not unique since a rotation of ‚àí ‚àí Œ∏ Œ∏ {\displaystyle -\theta } about ‚àí ‚àí œâ œâ {\displaystyle -{\boldsymbol {\omega }}} is the same as a rotation of Œ∏ Œ∏ {\displaystyle \theta } about œâ œâ {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\omega }}} . Of course, adding any integer multiple of 2œÄ to Œ∏ Œ∏ {\displaystyle \theta } will also result in the identical rotation; a better method is to constrain Œ∏ Œ∏ {\displaystyle \theta } to the interval [0, 2œÄ) or (-œÄ, œÄ].

The above calculation of axis vector œâ œâ {\displaystyle \omega } does not work if R is symmetric. Because, this is possible only when Œ∏ Œ∏ {\displaystyle \theta } = œÄ, so sin( Œ∏ Œ∏ {\displaystyle \theta } ) = 0, causing a division by 0 in the formula. However, the limit of the formula for œâ œâ {\displaystyle \omega } , as Œ∏ Œ∏ {\displaystyle \theta } ‚Üí œÄ, gives the correct value for œâ œâ {\displaystyle \omega } . For the general case the œâ œâ {\displaystyle \omega } may also be found using null space of R-I , see rotation matrix#Determining the axis .

The matrix logarithm of the rotation matrix R is log ‚Å° ‚Å° R = { 0 if Œ∏ Œ∏ = 0 Œ∏ Œ∏ 2 sin ‚Å° ‚Å° Œ∏ Œ∏ ( R ‚àí ‚àí R T ) if Œ∏ Œ∏ ‚â† ‚â† 0 and Œ∏ Œ∏ ‚àà ‚àà ( ‚àí ‚àí œÄ œÄ , œÄ œÄ ) {\displaystyle \log R={\begin{cases}0&{\text{if }}\theta =0\\{\dfrac {\theta }{2\sin \theta }}\left(R-R^{\mathsf {T}}\right)&{\text{if }}\theta \neq 0{\text{ and }}\theta \in (-\pi ,\pi )\end{cases}}} An exception occurs when R has eigenvalues equal to ‚àí1 . In this case, the log is not unique. However, even in the case where Œ∏ = œÄ the Frobenius norm of the log is ‚Äñ ‚Äñ log ‚Å° ‚Å° ( R ) ‚Äñ ‚Äñ F = 2 | Œ∏ Œ∏ | .

{\displaystyle \|\log(R)\|_{\mathrm {F} }={\sqrt {2}}|\theta |\,.} Given rotation matrices A and B , d g ( A , B ) := ‚Äñ log ‚Å° ‚Å° ( A T B ) ‚Äñ F {\displaystyle d_{g}(A,B):=\left\|\log \left(A^{\mathsf {T}}B\right)\right\|_{\mathrm {F} }} is the geodesic distance on the 3D manifold of rotation matrices.

For small rotations, the above computation of Œ∏ may be numerically imprecise as the derivative of arccos goes to infinity as Œ∏ ‚Üí 0 . In that case, the off-axis terms will actually provide better information about Œ∏ since, for small angles, R ‚âà I + Œ∏ K . (This is because these are the first two terms of the Taylor series for exp( Œ∏ K ) .) This formulation also has numerical problems at Œ∏ = œÄ , where the off-axis terms do not give information about the rotation axis (which is still defined up to a sign ambiguity). In that case, we must reconsider the above formula.

R = I + K sin ‚Å° ‚Å° Œ∏ Œ∏ + K 2 ( 1 ‚àí ‚àí cos ‚Å° ‚Å° Œ∏ Œ∏ ) {\displaystyle R=I+\mathbf {K} \sin \theta +\mathbf {K} ^{2}(1-\cos \theta )} At Œ∏ = œÄ , we have R = I + 2 K 2 = I + 2 ( œâ œâ ‚äó ‚äó œâ œâ ‚àí ‚àí I ) = 2 œâ œâ ‚äó ‚äó œâ œâ ‚àí ‚àí I {\displaystyle R=I+2\mathbf {K} ^{2}=I+2({\boldsymbol {\omega }}\otimes {\boldsymbol {\omega }}-I)=2{\boldsymbol {\omega }}\otimes {\boldsymbol {\omega }}-I} and so let B := œâ œâ ‚äó ‚äó œâ œâ = 1 2 ( R + I ) , {\displaystyle B:={\boldsymbol {\omega }}\otimes {\boldsymbol {\omega }}={\frac {1}{2}}(R+I)\,,} so the diagonal terms of B are the squares of the elements of œâ and the signs (up to sign ambiguity) can be determined from the signs of the off-axis terms of B .

Unit quaternions [ edit ] Main article: Quaternions and spatial rotation The following expression transforms axis‚Äìangle coordinates to versors (unit quaternions ): q = ( cos ‚Å° ‚Å° Œ∏ Œ∏ 2 , œâ œâ sin ‚Å° ‚Å° Œ∏ Œ∏ 2 ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {q} =\left(\cos {\tfrac {\theta }{2}},{\boldsymbol {\omega }}\sin {\tfrac {\theta }{2}}\right)} Given a versor q = r + v represented with its scalar r and vector v , the axis‚Äìangle coordinates can be extracted using the following: Œ∏ Œ∏ = 2 arccos ‚Å° ‚Å° r œâ œâ = { v sin ‚Å° ‚Å° Œ∏ Œ∏ 2 , if Œ∏ Œ∏ ‚â† ‚â† 0 0 , otherwise .

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\theta &=2\arccos r\\[8px]{\boldsymbol {\omega }}&={\begin{cases}{\dfrac {\mathbf {v} }{\sin {\tfrac {\theta }{2}}}},&{\text{if }}\theta \neq 0\\0,&{\text{otherwise}}.\end{cases}}\end{aligned}}} A more numerically stable expression of the rotation angle uses the atan2 function: Œ∏ Œ∏ = 2 atan2 ‚Å° ‚Å° ( | v | , r ) , {\displaystyle \theta =2\operatorname {atan2} (|\mathbf {v} |,r)\,,} where | v | is the Euclidean norm of the 3-vector v .
