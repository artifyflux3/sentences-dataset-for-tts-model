In mechanics , a variable-mass system is a collection of matter whose mass varies with time . It can be confusing to try to apply Newton's second law of motion directly to such a system.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Instead, the time dependence of the mass m can be calculated by rearranging Newton's second law and adding a term to account for the momentum carried by mass entering or leaving the system. The general equation of variable-mass motion is written as F e x t + v r e l d m d t = m d v d t {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} _{\mathrm {ext} }+\mathbf {v} _{\mathrm {rel} }{\frac {\mathrm {d} m}{\mathrm {d} t}}=m{\mathrm {d} \mathbf {v}  \over \mathrm {d} t}} where F ext is the net external force on the body, v rel is the relative velocity of the escaping or incoming mass with respect to the center of mass of the body, and v is the velocity of the body.

[ 3 ] In astrodynamics , which deals with the mechanics of rockets , the term v rel is often called the effective exhaust velocity and denoted v e .

[ 4 ] Derivation [ edit ] There are different derivations for the variable-mass system motion equation, depending on whether the mass is entering or leaving a body (in other words, whether the moving body's mass is increasing or decreasing, respectively).  To simplify calculations, all bodies are considered as particles . It is also assumed that the mass is unable to apply external forces on the body outside of accretion/ablation events.

Mass accretion [ edit ] At instant 1, a mass d m with velocity u is about to collide with the main body of mass m and velocity v .  After a time d t , at instant 2, both particles move as one body with velocity v + d v .

The following derivation is for a body that is gaining mass ( accretion ).  A body of time-varying mass m moves at a velocity v at an initial time t . In the same instant, a particle of mass dm moves with velocity u with respect to ground.  The initial momentum can be written as [ 5 ] p 1 = m v + u d m {\displaystyle \mathbf {p} _{\mathrm {1} }=m\mathbf {v} +\mathbf {u} \mathrm {d} m} Now at a   this time t + d t , let both the main body and the particle accrete into a body of velocity v + d v .  Thus the new momentum of the system can be written as p 2 = ( m + d m ) ( v + d v ) = m v + m d v + v d m + d m d v {\displaystyle \mathbf {p} _{\mathrm {2} }=(m+\mathrm {d} m)(\mathbf {v} +\mathrm {d} \mathbf {v} )=m\mathbf {v} +m\mathrm {d} \mathbf {v} +\mathbf {v} \mathrm {d} m+\mathrm {d} m\mathrm {d} \mathbf {v} } Since d m d v is the product of two small values, it can be ignored, meaning during d t the momentum of the system varies for d p = p 2 − − p 1 = ( m v + m d v + v d m ) − − ( m v + u d m ) = m d v − − ( u − − v ) d m {\displaystyle \mathrm {d} \mathbf {p} =\mathbf {p} _{\mathrm {2} }-\mathbf {p} _{\mathrm {1} }=(m\mathbf {v} +m\mathrm {d} \mathbf {v} +\mathbf {v} \mathrm {d} m)-(m\mathbf {v} +\mathbf {u} \mathrm {d} m)=m\mathrm {d} \mathbf {v} -(\mathbf {u} -\mathbf {v} )\mathrm {d} m} Therefore, by Newton's second law F e x t = d p d t = m d v − − ( u − − v ) d m d t = m d v d t − − ( u − − v ) d m d t {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} _{\mathrm {ext} }={\frac {\mathrm {d} \mathbf {p} }{\mathrm {d} t}}={\frac {m\mathrm {d} \mathbf {v} -(\mathbf {u} -\mathbf {v} )\mathrm {d} m}{\mathrm {d} t}}=m{\frac {\mathrm {d} \mathbf {v} }{\mathrm {d} t}}-(\mathbf {u} -\mathbf {v} ){\frac {\mathrm {d} m}{\mathrm {d} t}}} Noting that u - v is the velocity of d m relative to m , symbolized as v rel , this final equation can be arranged as [ 6 ] F e x t + v r e l d m d t = m d v d t {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} _{\mathrm {ext} }+\mathbf {v} _{\mathrm {rel} }{\frac {\mathrm {d} m}{\mathrm {d} t}}=m{\mathrm {d} \mathbf {v}  \over \mathrm {d} t}} Mass ablation/ejection [ edit ] In a system where mass is being ejected or ablated from a main body, the derivation is slightly different.  At time t , let a mass m travel at a velocity v , meaning the initial momentum of the system is p 1 = m v {\displaystyle \mathbf {p} _{\mathrm {1} }=m\mathbf {v} } Assuming u to be the velocity of the ablated mass d m with respect to the ground, at a time t + d t the momentum of the system becomes p 2 = ( m − − d m ) ( v + d v ) + u d m = m v + m d v − − v d m − − d m d v + u d m {\displaystyle \mathbf {p} _{\mathrm {2} }=(m-\mathrm {d} m)(\mathbf {v} +\mathrm {d} \mathbf {v} )+\mathbf {u} \mathrm {d} m=m\mathbf {v} +m\mathrm {d} \mathbf {v} -\mathbf {v} \mathrm {d} m-\mathrm {d} m\mathrm {d} \mathbf {v} +\mathbf {u} \mathrm {d} m} where u is the velocity of the ejected mass with respect to ground, and is negative because the ablated mass moves in opposite direction to the mass. Thus during d t the momentum of the system varies for d p = p 2 − − p 1 = ( m v + m d v − − d m d v − − v d m + u d m ) − − ( m v ) = m d v + [ u − − ( v + d v ) ] d m {\displaystyle \mathrm {d} \mathbf {p} =\mathbf {p} _{\mathrm {2} }-\mathbf {p} _{\mathrm {1} }=(m\mathbf {v} +m\mathrm {d} \mathbf {v} -\mathrm {d} \mathbf {m} \mathrm {d} \mathbf {v} -\mathbf {v} \mathrm {d} m+\mathbf {u} \mathrm {d} m)-(m\mathbf {v} )=m\mathrm {d} \mathbf {v} +[\mathbf {u} -(\mathbf {v} +\mathrm {d} \mathbf {v} )]\mathrm {d} m} Relative velocity v rel of the ablated mass with respect to the mass m is written as v r e l = u − − ( v + d v ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} _{\mathrm {rel} }=\mathbf {u} -(\mathbf {v} +\mathrm {d} \mathbf {v} )} Therefore, change in momentum can be written as d p = m d v + v r e l d m {\displaystyle \mathrm {d} \mathbf {p} =m\mathrm {d} \mathbf {v} +\mathbf {v} _{\mathrm {rel} }\mathrm {d} m} Therefore, by Newton's second law F e x t = d p d t = m d v + v r e l d m d t = m d v d t + v r e l d m d t {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} _{\mathrm {ext} }={\frac {\mathrm {d} \mathbf {p} }{\mathrm {d} t}}={\frac {m\mathrm {d} \mathbf {v} +\mathbf {v} _{\mathrm {rel} }\mathrm {d} m}{\mathrm {d} t}}=m{\frac {\mathrm {d} \mathbf {v} }{\mathrm {d} t}}+\mathbf {v} _{\mathrm {rel} }{\frac {\mathrm {d} m}{\mathrm {d} t}}} Therefore, the final equation can be arranged as F e x t − − v r e l d m d t = m d v d t {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} _{\mathrm {ext} }-\mathbf {v} _{\mathrm {rel} }{\frac {\mathrm {d} m}{\mathrm {d} t}}=m{\mathrm {d} \mathbf {v}  \over \mathrm {d} t}} Forms [ edit ] When released, this rocket balloon ejects a significant amount of its mass as air, causing a large acceleration.

By the definition of acceleration , a = d v /d t , so the variable-mass system motion equation can be written as F e x t + v r e l d m d t = m a {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} _{\mathrm {ext} }+\mathbf {v} _{\mathrm {rel} }{\frac {\mathrm {d} m}{\mathrm {d} t}}=m\mathbf {a} } In bodies that are not treated as particles a must be replaced by a cm , the acceleration of the center of mass of the system, meaning F e x t + v r e l d m d t = m a c m {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} _{\mathrm {ext} }+\mathbf {v} _{\mathrm {rel} }{\frac {\mathrm {d} m}{\mathrm {d} t}}=m\mathbf {a} _{\mathrm {cm} }} Often the force due to thrust is defined as F t h r u s t = v r e l d m d t {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} _{\mathrm {thrust} }=\mathbf {v} _{\mathrm {rel} }{\frac {\mathrm {d} m}{\mathrm {d} t}}} so that F e x t + F t h r u s t = m a c m {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} _{\mathrm {ext} }+\mathbf {F} _{\mathrm {thrust} }=m\mathbf {a} _{\mathrm {cm} }} This form shows that a body can have acceleration due to thrust even if no external forces act on it ( F ext = 0).  Note finally that if one lets F net be the sum of F ext and F thrust then the equation regains the usual form of Newton's second law: F n e t = m a c m {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} _{\mathrm {net} }=m\mathbf {a} _{\mathrm {cm} }} Ideal rocket equation [ edit ] Rocket mass ratios versus final velocity calculated from the rocket equation Main article: Tsiolkovsky rocket equation The ideal rocket equation , or the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation, can be used to study the motion of vehicles that behave like a rocket (where a body accelerates itself by ejecting part of its mass, a propellant , with high speed). It can be derived from the general equation of motion for variable-mass systems as follows: when no external forces act on a body ( F ext = 0) the variable-mass system motion equation reduces to [ 2 ] v r e l d m d t = m d v d t {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} _{\mathrm {rel} }{\frac {\mathrm {d} m}{\mathrm {d} t}}=m{\frac {\mathrm {d} \mathbf {v} }{\mathrm {d} t}}} If the velocity of the ejected propellant, v rel , is assumed to have the opposite direction as the rocket's acceleration, d v /d t , the scalar equivalent of this equation can be written as − − v r e l d m d t = m d v d t {\displaystyle -v_{\mathrm {rel} }{\frac {\mathrm {d} m}{\mathrm {d} t}}=m{\mathrm {d} v \over \mathrm {d} t}} from which d t can be canceled out to give − − v r e l d m = m d v {\displaystyle -v_{\mathrm {rel} }\mathrm {d} m=m\mathrm {d} v\,} Integration by separation of variables gives − − v r e l ∫ ∫ m 0 m 1 d m m = ∫ ∫ v 0 v 1 d v {\displaystyle -v_{\mathrm {rel} }\int _{m_{0}}^{m_{1}}{\frac {\mathrm {d} m}{m}}=\int _{v_{0}}^{v_{1}}\mathrm {d} v} v r e l ln ⁡ ⁡ m 0 m 1 = v 1 − − v 0 {\displaystyle v_{\mathrm {rel} }\ln {\frac {m_{0}}{m_{1}}}=v_{1}-v_{0}} By rearranging and letting Δ v = v 1 - v 0 , one arrives at the standard form of the ideal rocket equation: Δ Δ v = v r e l ln ⁡ ⁡ m 0 m 1 {\displaystyle \Delta v=v_{\mathrm {rel} }\ln {\frac {m_{0}}{m_{1}}}} where m 0 is the initial total mass, including propellant, m 1 is the final total mass, v rel is the effective exhaust velocity (often denoted as v e ), and Δ v is the maximum change of speed of the vehicle (when no external forces are acting).
