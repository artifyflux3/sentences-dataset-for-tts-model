In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), **connectedness**[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectedness#cite_note-1) is used to refer to various properties meaning, in some sense, "all one piece". When a mathematical object has such a property, we say it is **connected**; otherwise it is **disconnected**. When a disconnected object can be split naturally into connected pieces, each piece is usually called a _component_ (or _connected component_).

Connectedness in topology

A [topological space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space "Topological space") is said to be _[connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected\_space "Connected space")_ if it is not the union of two [disjoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint_sets "Disjoint sets") nonempty [open sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_set "Open set").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectedness#cite_note-2) A [set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics) "Set (mathematics)") is open if it contains no point lying on its [boundary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(topology) "Boundary (topology)"); thus, in an informal, intuitive sense, the fact that a space can be partitioned into disjoint open sets suggests that the boundary between the two sets is not part of the space, and thus splits it into two separate pieces.

Other notions of connectedness

Fields of mathematics are typically concerned with special kinds of objects. Often such an object is said to be _connected_ if, when it is considered as a topological space, it is a connected space. Thus, [manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold "Manifold"), [Lie groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_group "Lie group"), and [graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics) "Graph (discrete mathematics)") are all called _connected_ if they are connected as topological spaces, and their components are the topological components. Sometimes it is convenient to restate the definition of connectedness in such fields. For example, a graph is said to be _[connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected\_graph "Connected graph")_ if each pair of [vertices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_(graph_theory) "Vertex (graph theory)") in the graph is joined by a [path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(graph_theory) "Path (graph theory)"). This definition is equivalent to the topological one, as applied to graphs, but it is easier to deal with in the context of [graph theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory "Graph theory"). Graph theory also offers a context-free measure of connectedness, called the [clustering coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clustering_coefficient "Clustering coefficient").

Other fields of mathematics are concerned with objects that are rarely considered as topological spaces. Nonetheless, definitions of _connectedness_ often reflect the topological meaning in some way. For example, in [category theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory "Category theory"), a [category](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_(mathematics) "Category (mathematics)") is said to be _[connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected\_category "Connected category")_ if each pair of objects in it is joined by a sequence of [morphisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphism "Morphism"). Thus, a category is connected if it is, intuitively, all one piece.

There may be different notions of _connectedness_ that are intuitively similar, but different as formally defined concepts. We might wish to call a topological space _connected_ if each pair of points in it is joined by a [path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(topology) "Path (topology)"). However this condition turns out to be stronger than standard topological connectedness; in particular, there are connected topological spaces for which this property does not hold. Because of this, different terminology is used; spaces with this property are said to be _[path connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path\_connected "Path connected")_. While not all connected spaces are path connected, all path connected spaces are connected.

Terms involving _connected_ are also used for properties that are related to, but clearly different from, connectedness. For example, a path-connected topological space is _[simply connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simply\_connected\_space "Simply connected space")_ if each loop (path from a point to itself) in it is [contractible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contractible "Contractible"); that is, intuitively, if there is essentially only one way to get from any point to any other point. Thus, a [sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere "Sphere") and a [disk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_(mathematics) "Disk (mathematics)") are each simply connected, while a [torus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torus "Torus") is not. As another example, a [directed graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph "Directed graph") is _[strongly connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongly\_connected\_component "Strongly connected component")_ if each [ordered pair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_pair "Ordered pair") of vertices is joined by a [directed path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_path "Directed path") (that is, one that "follows the arrows").

Other concepts express the way in which an object is _not_ connected. For example, a topological space is _[totally disconnected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totally\_disconnected "Totally disconnected")_ if each of its components is a single point.

Properties and parameters based on the idea of connectedness often involve the word _connectivity_. For example, in [graph theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory "Graph theory"), a [connected graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_graph "Connected graph") is one from which we must remove at least one vertex to create a disconnected graph.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectedness#cite_note-3) In recognition of this, such graphs are also said to be _1-connected_. Similarly, a graph is _2-connected_ if we must remove at least two vertices from it, to create a disconnected graph. A _3-connected_ graph requires the removal of at least three vertices, and so on. The _[connectivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectivity\_(graph\_theory) "Connectivity (graph theory)")_ of a graph is the minimum number of vertices that must be removed to disconnect it. Equivalently, the connectivity of a graph is the greatest integer _k_ for which the graph is _k_-connected.

While terminology varies, [noun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noun "Noun") forms of connectedness-related properties often include the term _connectivity_. Thus, when discussing simply connected topological spaces, it is far more common to speak of _simple connectivity_ than _simple connectedness_. On the other hand, in fields without a formally defined notion of _connectivity_, the word may be used as a synonym for _connectedness_.

Another example of connectivity can be found in regular tilings. Here, the connectivity describes the number of neighbors accessible from a single [tile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tile "Tile"):
