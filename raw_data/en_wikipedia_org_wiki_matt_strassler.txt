Strassler is a theoretical physicist , science communicator , and educator known for the cascading gauge theory .

Education [ edit ] Strassler studied at Simon's Rock College and Princeton University , and further obtained his Ph.D from Stanford University under the supervision of Michael Peskin .

[ 1 ] During his collegiate career he also performed concerts.

[ 2 ] Career [ edit ] Teaching and scholarly positions [ edit ] Strassler was a member at the Institute for Advanced Study in 2002.

[ 3 ] From 2000 until 2002 he taught at the University of Pennsylvania , [ 4 ] and then moved to the University of Washington until 2007.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] He left to a professorship at Rutgers University until 2013.

[ 7 ] In 2013 he was a visiting scholar at Harvard, and in 2015, was an associate in the Physics Department.

[ 8 ] Scholarly publications [ edit ] Strassler's scholarly publications has ranked h-index of 44 as of May 2024 according to INSPIRE-HEP [ 9 ] and of 51 according to Google Scholar .

[ 10 ] His publication, "Supergravity and a confining gauge theory: duality cascades and χSB-resolution of naked singularities", co-written with Igor Klebanov for the Journal of High Energy Physics in 2000, developed the cascading gauge theory .

[ 11 ] His particle physics article "Echoes of a hidden valley at hadron colliders" (2006), co-written with Kathryn Zurek , [ 12 ] appeared in Physics Letters B .

[ 13 ] Science writing [ edit ] Strassler's physics-oriented blog, Of Particular Significance , often includes reality-checks on mainstream media coverage of physics news.

[ 14 ] He has written for such outlets as New Scientist .

[ 15 ] His book Waves in an Impossible Sea: How Everyday Life Emerges from the Cosmic Ocean was published in March 2024, by Basic Books .

[ 16 ] Accolades [ edit ] Strassler was elected a fellow of the American Physical Society in 2007 "[f]or work extending the AdS/CFT gravity/gauge duality to QCD-like confining theories, and for insights into novel aspects of the physics of strongly coupled supersymmetric theories".
