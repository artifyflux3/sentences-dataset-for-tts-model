Origin of term [ edit ] The term was popularized by William Gibson in his short story " Burning Chrome ", which also introduced the term cyberspace , and in his subsequent novel Neuromancer .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] According to the Jargon File , as well as Gibson's own acknowledgements, the term ICE was originally coined by Tom Maddox .

[ 1 ] Description of ICE [ edit ] "Black ICE" redirects here. For other uses, see black ice (disambiguation) .

When viewed in a cyberspace virtual reality environment, these constructs are often represented by actual walls of ice, stone, or metal.

Black ICE refers to ICE that are capable of killing the intruder if deemed necessary or appropriate; some forms of black ICE may be artificially intelligent .

[ citation needed ] Real-world usage [ edit ] Main articles: Computer security and Intrusion detection system Though real-life firewalls , anti-virus software and similar programs fall under this classification, the term has little real world significance and remains primarily a science fiction concept. This can be attributed to the fact that using the term "electronics" to describe software products (such as firewalls) is something of a misnomer . On the other hand, there is a strong connection between real-world cybercrime and cyberpunk literature.

[ 3 ] "The Gibsonian concept of cyberspace [...] fed back into both computer and information systems design and theory," wrote Roger Burrows.

[ 4 ] The term ICE has occasionally been used for real-world software: BlackICE , an intrusion detection system built by a California company named Network ICE in 1999, acquired by IBM Internet Security Systems , then discontinued in 2007.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] The ICE cipher , an encryption algorithm, may be inspired by Gibson's ICE, but it is explained as meaning "Information Concealment Engine".

[ 7 ] The Java bytecode verifier in the Apache ByteCode Engineering Library (BCEL) is called JustIce (see the 'docs' folder for documentation).

[ 8 ] On April 28, 2009, the Information and Communications Enhancement Act, or ICE Act for short, was introduced to the United States Senate by Senator Tom Carper to make changes to the handling of information security by the federal government, including the establishment of the National Office for Cyberspace.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] Usage in fiction [ edit ] The term ICE is widely used in cyberpunk fiction.

Anime [ edit ] Cyberpunk: Edgerunners Cyber City Oedo 808 Ghost in the Shell , where ICE is referred to directly by name or else as an 'Attack Barrier'.

Cartoons [ edit ] Phantom 2040 , though in it "ICE" stands for "Integrated Cyber Environment", referring to cyberspace , rather than Intrusion Countermeasures Electronics [ 11 ] Card games [ edit ] Netrunner , based on Cyberpunk 2020 setting, where the corporate player uses ICE and the runner player uses icebreakers; while corps in Netrunner understand ICE to be an acronym for "Intrusion Countermeasures Electronics", the runner viewpoint is that the acronym should be for "Insidious Cortical Electrocution" Android: Netrunner , an adaptation of the original Netrunner for the Android setting Hacker and Hacker II - The Dark Side , where the players attempt to gain illicit access systems represented by playing cards arranged in a network while avoiding getting zapped by ICE and Black ICE.

Literature [ edit ] Neuromancer , original popularizer of the term [ 1 ] [ 2 ] Count Zero the second novel of William Gibson's "Sprawl trilogy" Hyperion , wherein black ICE is used to defend the TechnoCore Trouble and Her Friends by Melissa Scott, wherein IC(E) refers to Intrusion Countermeasures (Electronic), solving the problem of implying that the measures are hardware-based Roleplaying games [ edit ] Cyberpunk 2020 , upon which the Netrunner card game is based GURPS Cyberpunk Shadowrun , called IC (The setting drops the "electronics" misnomer ) but is colloquially named "Ice" by hackers in the setting Shadow of the Beanstalk , a roleplaying game based on Android universe Movies [ edit ] Johnny Mnemonic , mentioned in the opening crawl.
