Schawlow Award given by the Laser Institute of America .

The Arthur L. Schawlow Prize in Laser Science is a prize that has been awarded annually by the American Physical Society since 1991. The recipient is chosen for " outstanding contributions to basic research which uses lasers to advance our knowledge of the fundamental physical properties of materials and their interaction with light ". The prize is named after Arthur L. Schawlow (1921–1999), laser pioneer and a Nobel laureate in physics , and as of 2007 is valued at $10,000.
