( January 2025 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Wet-bulb potential temperature , sometimes referred to as pseudo wet-bulb potential temperature , is the temperature that a parcel of air at any level would have if, starting at the wet-bulb temperature , it were brought at the saturated adiabatic lapse rate to the standard pressure of 1,000 mbar.

This temperature is conservative with respect to reversible adiabatic changes.
