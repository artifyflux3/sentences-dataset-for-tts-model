It has a status of naukograd (i.e. town of science), being home to the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research , an international nuclear physics research center and one of the largest scientific foundations in the country. It is also home to MKB Raduga , a defense aerospace company specializing in design and production of missile systems, as well as to the Russia's largest satellite communications center owned by Russian Satellite Communications Company .

[ 7 ] The modern town was developed in the middle of the 20th century and town status was granted to it in 1956. Population: 70,663 ( 2010 Census ) ; [ 2 ] 60,951 ( 2002 Census ) ; [ 8 ] 65,805 ( 1989 Soviet census ) .

[ 9 ] Geography [ edit ] The town is 120 meters (390 ft) above sea level , situated approximately 125 kilometers (78 mi) north of Moscow , on the Volga River , just downstream from the Ivankovo Reservoir . The reservoir is formed by a hydroelectric dam across the Volga situated within the town borders. The town lies on both banks of the Volga. The western boundary of the town is defined by the Moscow Canal joining the Volga, while the eastern boundary is defined by the Dubna River joining the Volga.

[ citation needed ] Dubna is the northernmost town of Moscow Oblast.

Find sources: "Dubna" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( February 2022 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Pre-World War II [ edit ] Fortress Dubna ( Russian : Дубна ) belonging to Rostov-Suzdal Principality was built in the area in 1132 by the order of Yuri Dolgoruki and existed until 1216. The fortress was destroyed during the feudal war between the sons of Vsevolod the Big Nest . The village of Gorodishche ( Городище ) was located on the right bank of the Volga River and was a part of the Kashin Principality . Dubna customs post ( Дубненское мыто) was located in the area and was a part of the Principality of Tver .

Before the October Revolution , few villages were in the area: Podberezye was on the left bank of the Volga, and Gorodishche, Alexandrovka, Ivankovo, Yurkino, and Kozlaki ( Russian : Козлаки ) were on the right bank.

Right after the Revolution one of the first collective farms was organized in Dubna area.

In 1931, the Orgburo of the Communist Party made a decision to build the Volga-Moscow Canal .

Genrikh Yagoda , then the leader of the State Political Directorate , was put in charge of construction. The Canal was completed in 1937.

Ivankovo Reservoir and Ivankovo hydroelectrical plant were also created as a part of the project. Many villages and the town Korcheva were submerged under water. Dubna is mentioned in Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn 's book The Gulag Archipelago as the town built by Gulag prisoners.

Science [ edit ] See also: Joint Institute for Nuclear Research The decision to build a proton accelerator for nuclear research was taken by the Soviet government in 1946. An impractical place where the current town is situated was chosen due to remoteness from Moscow and the presence of the Ivankovo power plant nearby. The scientific leader was Igor Kurchatov . The general supervisor of the project including construction of a settlement, a road and a railway connecting it to Moscow (largely involving penal labour of Gulag inmates) was the NKVD chief Lavrentiy Beria . After three years of intensive work, the accelerator was commissioned on 13 December 1949.

The town of Dubna was officially inaugurated in 1956, together with the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR), which has developed into a large international research laboratory involved mainly in particle physics , heavy ion physics, synthesis of transuranium elements , and radiobiology . In 1960, a town of Ivankovo situated on the opposite (left) bank of the Volga was merged into Dubna. In 1964, Dubna hosted the prestigious International Conference on High Energy Physics .

Currently, a construction of the NICA particle collider , a megascience project is underway in Dubna.

Outstanding physicists of the 20th century including Nikolay Bogolyubov , Georgy Flyorov , Vladimir Veksler , and Bruno Pontecorvo used to work at the institute. A number of elementary particles and nuclei of transuranium elements (most recently, element 117 tennessine ) have been discovered and investigated there, leading to the honorary naming of chemical element 105 dubnium (Db) for the town.

Administrative and municipal status [ edit ] Within the framework of administrative divisions , it is incorporated as Dubna Town Under Oblast Jurisdiction —an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts .

[ 1 ] As a municipal division , Dubna Town Under Oblast Jurisdiction is incorporated as Dubna Urban Okrug .

Since then their role has decreased significantly. Several small industrial enterprises have emerged, however the town still experiences some employment difficulties. Proximity to Moscow allows many to commute and work there. Plans by AFK Sistema and other investors including government structures have been announced to build a Russian analogue of Silicon Valley in Dubna. As of the beginning of 2007, nothing has commenced.
