Autumn colours at Westonbirt Arboretum , Gloucestershire , England An arboretum ( pl.

: arboreta ) is a botanical collection composed exclusively of trees and shrubs of a variety of species.  Originally mostly created as a section in a larger garden or park for specimens of mostly non-local species, many modern arboreta are in botanical gardens as living collections of woody plants and are intended at least in part for scientific study.

In Latin, an arboretum is a place planted with trees, not necessarily in this specific sense, and "arboretum" as an English word is first recorded used by John Claudius Loudon in 1833 in The Gardener's Magazine , but the concept was already long-established by then.

[ 1 ] The pinetum section at RHS Wisley An arboretum specializing in growing conifers is known as a pinetum . Other specialist arboreta include saliceta ( willows ), populeta ( poplar ), and querceta ( oaks ). Related collections include a fruticetum , from the Latin frutex , meaning shrub , much more often a shrubbery , and a viticetum (from the Latin vitis, meaning vine , referring in particular to a grape vine ).  A palm house is a large greenhouse for palms and other tender trees.

[ citation needed ] Hatshepsut 's expedition to Punt returned bearing thirty-one live frankincense trees, the roots of which were carefully kept in baskets for the duration of the voyage; this was the first recorded attempt to transplant foreign trees . It is reported that Hatshepsut had these trees planted in the courts of her Deir el Bahri mortuary temple complex.

[ 2 ] Marco Polo describes how Kublai Khan collected specimens of evergreen trees that he admired from around the Mongol Empire in the late 13th century, and had them brought by elephant to his winter capital at Khanbaliq (modern Beijing ), where they were planted on a large artificial mound, "a hundred paces in height and over a mile in cicumference", known as the "Green Mound", with a palace or pavilion at the top.  The ground of the mound was also covered in pieces of green stone.

[ 3 ] In an arboretum a wide variety of trees and shrubs are cultivated. Typically the individual trees are labelled for identification. The trees may also be organised in a way to aid their study or growth.

Many tree collections have been claimed as the first modern arboretum, with the term applied retrospectively as it probably did not come into use even orally until the later eighteenth century, or later. Probably the most important early proponent of the arboretum in the English-speaking transatlantic world was the prolific landscape gardener and writer, John Claudius Loudon (1783–1843) who undertook many gardening commissions and published the Gardener's Magazine , Encyclopaedia of Gardening and other major works. Loudon's Arboretum et Fruticetum Britannicum , 8 vols., (1838) is probably the most significant work on the subject in British history and included an account of all trees and shrubs that were hardy in the British climate , an international history of arboriculture , an assessment of the cultural, economic and industrial value of trees and four volumes of plates.

Loudon urged that a national arboretum be created and called for arboreta and other systematic collections to be established in public parks , private gardens, country estates, and other places. He regarded the Derby Arboretum (1840) as the most important landscape-gardening commission of the latter part of his career because it demonstrated the benefits of a public arboretum (for more details see below). Commenting on the Loddiges family's famous Hackney Botanic Garden arboretum, begun in 1816, which was a commercial nursery that subsequently opened free to the public, for educational benefit, every Sunday, Loudon wrote: "The arboretum looks better this season than it has ever done since it was planted... The more lofty trees suffered from the late high winds, but not materially. We walked round the two outer spirals of this coil of trees and shrubs; viz. from Acer to Quercus . There is no garden scene about London so interesting". A plan of the Loddiges' arboretum was included in The Encyclopaedia of Gardening , 1834 edition. Leaves from Loddiges' arboretum and in some instances entire trees, were studiously drawn to illustrate Loudon's encyclopaedic book Arboretum et Fruticetum Britannicum which also incorporated drawings from other early botanic gardens and parklands throughout the United Kingdom .

[ 4 ] One example of an early European tree collection is the Trsteno Arboretum , near Dubrovnik in Croatia . The date of its founding is unknown, but it was already in existence by 1492, when a 15 m (49 ft) span aqueduct to irrigate the arboretum was constructed; this aqueduct is still in use. The garden was created by the prominent local Gučetić/Gozze family . It suffered two major disasters in the 1990s but its two unique and ancient Oriental Planes remained standing.

It occupies 1.58 hectares (3.9 acres) near Ooty Lake . The site is a micro watershed area and a natural habitat for both indigenous and migratory birds; prior to the creation of the arboretum it had been neglected, and the feeder line bringing water to the lake was contaminated with urban waste and agricultural chemicals . From 2005 to 2006 the Hill Area Development Programme provided funds of Rs 1,250,000 for the construction of permanent fencing, a footpath, and other infrastructure facilities.

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] Europe [ edit ] During part of the 18th century, Abney Park Cemetery was the largest arboretum in Europe .

Abney Park Arboretum, London, England Shortly before the Derby Arboretum opened in 1840, another arboretum was opened for free public access at Abney Park Cemetery in Stoke Newington near London, modelled partly on Mount Auburn Cemetery near Boston and designed by Loddiges nursery. It was laid out with 2,500 trees and shrubs, all labelled and arranged in an unusual alphabetical format from A for Acer (maple trees) to Z for Zanthoxylum (American toothache trees). Until Kew was enlarged and opened to the public, this remained the largest arboretum in Europe. It never achieved the recognition of the better financed early nineteenth century botanical gardens and arboreta that could afford members' events, indoor facilities and curatorial staff for those who paid accordingly. However, unlike these, and even unlike the 'public' arboretum at Derby, the Abney Park arboretum always offered public access free of charge, though sometimes, by pre-arrangement; a Viewing Order was needed so as not to interfere with funeral events.

Derby Arboretum, Derbyshire, England The Derby Arboretum opened on 16 September 1840. Commissioned and presented by Joseph Strutt (1766–1844) a wealthy industrialist and major local benefactor, the Derby Arboretum was designed by John Claudius Loudon and had a major impact upon the development of urban parks. It was one of the first Victorian public parks and also unusual for the quality of its collection of trees and shrubs. Although established on only quite a small site of 14 acres, the park featured a labelled collection of over 1000 trees and shrubs and was landscaped with mounds, sinuous paths, urns, benches, statues, lodges and other features. Managed by a committee until it was acquired by the Derby Corporation during the 1880s, the Derby Arboretum was only open free to the public for two days of the week for its first four decades, the remaining days being reserved for subscribers and their families and guests. Very popular anniversary festivals were staged annually which drew crowds of tens of thousands and helped to fund the upkeep of the park. The Derby Arboretum is also significant because it was the planted counterpart to Loudon's Arboretum et Fruticetum Britannicum (1838) which detailed all the hardy and semi-hardy trees and shrubs of the British Isles. Within the park, the trees and shrubs were laid out according to the natural system and labelled so that visitors could identify them using the guide.

[ 12 ] The Derby park had a major impact on park design elsewhere including Europe, the British colonies and North America and other public parks and arboreta were established modelled on Loudon's creation and using his ideas. In 1859 for example, it was visited by Frederick Law Olmsted on his European tour of parks, and it had an influence on the planting in Central Park , New York. Industrial pollution killed most of the original plantings by the 1880s (although a few examples remain), but it has been renovated and replanted with National Lottery Heritage funding closer to Loudon's original layout and with a new cafe and visitor centre.

[ citation needed ] Dropmore Park, Buckinghamshire, England Dropmore Park , Buckinghamshire (Bucks) England, was created in the 1790s for future prime minister Lord Grenville . On his first day in occupation, he planted two cedar trees. At least another 2,500 trees were planted. By the time Grenville died in 1834, his pinetum contained the biggest collection of conifer species in Britain. Part of the post-millennium restoration is to use what survives as the basis for a collection of some 200 species.

[ 13 ] Dømmesmoen Arboret, Grimstad, Aust-Agder, Norway Dømmesmoen Arboret is a 40 hectares (99 acres) arboretum in Grimstad municipality, Aust-Agder county, Norway . In the Dømmesmoen forest, where the arboret is planned in harmony with nature, 22 different ecosystems have been defined. The trees and plants have been planted along the tracks so that the visitors can experience and learn about them in the various ecosystems. Information about the various ecosystems are found along the tracks in the forest and park area.

[ 14 ] Through the years, approximately 700 different species of trees and plants have been planted in the Dømmesmoen area.

[ 15 ] The Dømmesmoen area, where the arboret is situated, has a fascinating history. Excavations have found traces of settlements that can be dated to around year 0. There are 50-60 burial mounds from pre Viking area at Dømmesmoen, [ 16 ] among the densest burial mound areas found in Norway. The most famous attractions at Dømmesmoen among locals are a 400-500 year old hollow oak , and a wooden tower overlooking the town of Grimstad. 2 kilometres east of Dømmesmoen, at Fjære , Fjære church is situated. The stone church was built around year 1150, and has significant historical value dating back to the Viking area.

Golden Grove / Gelli Aur arboretum, Carmarthenshire, Wales Golden Grove / Gelli Aur Arboretum is a collection of mature trees and shrubs that spreads over 10 acres of the Golden Grove / Gelli Aur Country Park .

Commissioned by John Campbell, 2nd Earl Cawdor , the majority of the planting took place in 1865. It is an unusual, fine arboretum and celebrated in Victorian and Edwardian times as the finest in the UK.  It is built in an arc as though embracing the house, fanning out from an ancient oak which stands at the top of the terraced lawn.  The natural slope enhancing the view from the house.  Many of the trees are champions, they love the damp, temperate climate.  Several are on the Monumental Trees website.  The Great Western Red Cedar is particularly spectacular, people come from all over the world to see it.

Herbaceous plants and bulbs were planted as part of the carpet, and American and Asiatic shrubs were planted to provide colour and fragrance.  The Rhododendrons are an extremely fine single variety and present a spectacular display of colour in May and June. In the Summer the arboretum is bordered by white foxgloves, interspersed with shades of pink.

The arboretum is much loved by locals but it is an irony that the fame of its youth has been largely forgotten, unappreciated, in its magnificent maturity.
