A 5° × 6° view of a part of the geostationary belt, showing several geostationary satellites. Those with inclination 0° form a diagonal belt across the image; a few objects with small [inclinations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_inclination "Orbital inclination") to the [Equator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equator "Equator") are visible above this line. The satellites are pinpoint, while stars have created [star trails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_trail "Star trail") due to [Earth's rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_rotation "Earth's rotation").

A **geostationary orbit**, also referred to as a **geosynchronous equatorial orbit**[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-1) (**GEO**), is a [circular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_orbit "Circular orbit")[geosynchronous orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geosynchronous_orbit "Geosynchronous orbit") 35,786 km (22,236 mi) in altitude above Earth's [equator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equator "Equator"), 42,164 km (26,199 mi) in radius from Earth's center, and following the [direction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrograde_and_prograde_motion "Retrograde and prograde motion") of [Earth's rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_rotation "Earth's rotation").

An object in such an orbit has an [orbital period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_period "Orbital period") equal to Earth's rotational period, one [sidereal day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidereal_time "Sidereal time"), and so to ground observers it appears motionless, in a fixed position in the sky. The concept of a geostationary orbit was popularised by the science fiction writer [Arthur C. Clarke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_C._Clarke "Arthur C. Clarke") in the 1940s as a way to revolutionise telecommunications, and the first [satellite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite "Satellite") to be placed in this kind of orbit was launched in 1963.

[Communications satellites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_satellite "Communications satellite") are often placed in a geostationary orbit so that Earth-based [satellite antennas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_dish "Satellite dish") do not have to rotate to track them but can be pointed permanently at the position in the sky where the satellites are located. [Weather satellites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_satellite "Weather satellite") are also placed in this orbit for real-time monitoring and data collection, as are [navigation satellites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation_satellites "Navigation satellites") in order to provide a known calibration point and enhance GPS accuracy.

Geostationary satellites are launched via a [temporary orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parking_orbit "Parking orbit"), and then placed in a "slot" above a particular point on the Earth's surface. The satellite requires periodic station-keeping to maintain its position. Modern retired geostationary satellites are placed in a higher [graveyard orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graveyard_orbit "Graveyard orbit") to avoid collisions.

Syncom 2, the first geosynchronous satellite

In 1929, [Herman Potočnik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_Poto%C4%8Dnik "Herman Potočnik") described both geosynchronous orbits in general and the special case of the geostationary Earth orbit in particular as useful orbits for [space stations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station "Space station").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-2) The first appearance of a geostationary [orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit "Orbit") in popular literature was in October 1942, in the first [Venus Equilateral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_Equilateral "Venus Equilateral") story by [George O. Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_O._Smith "George O. Smith"),[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-VE-3) but Smith did not go into details. British [science fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction "Science fiction") author [Arthur C. Clarke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_C._Clarke "Arthur C. Clarke") popularised and expanded the concept in a 1945 paper entitled _Extra-Terrestrial Relays – Can Rocket Stations Give Worldwide Radio Coverage?_, published in _[Wireless World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless\_World "Wireless World")_ magazine. Clarke acknowledged the connection in his introduction to _The Complete Venus Equilateral_.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-VEintro-4)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-clarke-5) The orbit, which Clarke first described as useful for broadcast and relay communications satellites,[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-clarke-5) is sometimes called the Clarke orbit.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-6) Similarly, the collection of artificial satellites in this orbit is known as the Clarke Belt.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-7)

In technical terminology the orbit is referred to as either a geostationary or geosynchronous equatorial orbit, with the terms used somewhat interchangeably.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-8)

The first geostationary satellite was designed by [Harold Rosen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Rosen_(electrical_engineer) "Harold Rosen (electrical engineer)") while he was working at [Hughes Aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hughes_Aircraft "Hughes Aircraft") in 1959. Inspired by [Sputnik 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik_1 "Sputnik 1"), he wanted to use a geostationary satellite to globalise communications. Telecommunications between the US and Europe was then possible between just 136 people at a time, and reliant on [high frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_frequency "High frequency") radios and an [undersea cable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submarine_communications_cable "Submarine communications cable").[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-dm-9)

Conventional wisdom at the time was that it would require too much [rocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket "Rocket") power to place a satellite in a geostationary orbit and it would not survive long enough to justify the expense,[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-10) so early efforts were put towards constellations of satellites in [low](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit "Low Earth orbit") or [medium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium_Earth_Orbit "Medium Earth Orbit") Earth orbit.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-lat-11) The first of these were the passive [Echo balloon satellites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Echo "Project Echo") in 1960, followed by [Telstar 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telstar_1 "Telstar 1") in 1962.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-12) Although these projects had difficulties with signal strength and tracking, issues that could be solved using geostationary orbits, the concept was seen as impractical, so Hughes often withheld funds and support.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-lat-11)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-dm-9)

By 1961, Rosen and his team had produced a cylindrical prototype with a diameter of 76 centimetres (30 in), height of 38 centimetres (15 in), weighing 11.3 kilograms (25 lb), light and small enough to be placed into orbit. It was [spin stabilised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-stabilisation "Spin-stabilisation") with a dipole antenna producing a pancake shaped beam.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-13) In August 1961, they were contracted to begin building the real satellite.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-dm-9) They lost [Syncom 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncom#Syncom_1 "Syncom") to electronics failure, but [Syncom 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncom#Syncom_2 "Syncom") was successfully placed into a geosynchronous orbit in 1963. Although its [inclined orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclined_orbit "Inclined orbit") still required moving antennas, it was able to relay TV transmissions, and allowed for US President [John F. Kennedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy "John F. Kennedy") in Washington D.C., to phone Nigerian prime minister [Abubakar Tafawa Balewa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abubakar_Tafawa_Balewa "Abubakar Tafawa Balewa") aboard the [USNS Kingsport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USNS_Kingsport "USNS Kingsport") docked in [Lagos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagos "Lagos") on August 23, 1963.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-lat-11)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-14)

The first satellite placed in a geostationary orbit was [Syncom 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncom#Syncom_3 "Syncom"), which was launched by a [Delta D rocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_(rocket_family)#Delta_D "Delta (rocket family)") in 1964.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-15) With its increased bandwidth, this satellite was able to transmit live coverage of the Summer Olympics from Japan to America. Geostationary orbits have been in common use ever since, in particular for satellite television.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-lat-11)

Today there are hundreds of geostationary satellites providing [remote sensing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_sensing "Remote sensing") and communications.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-dm-9)[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-16)

Although most populated land locations on the planet now have terrestrial communications facilities ([microwave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave "Microwave"), [fiber-optic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber-optic "Fiber-optic")), with telephone access covering 96% of the population and internet access 90%,[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-17) some rural and remote areas in developed countries are still reliant on satellite communications.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-18)[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-19)

Most commercial [communications satellites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_satellite "Communications satellite"), [broadcast satellites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_satellite "Broadcast satellite") and [SBAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SBAS "SBAS") satellites operate in geostationary orbits.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-20)[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-gmv-21)[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-22)

Geostationary communication satellites are useful because they are visible from a large area of the earth's surface, extending 81° away in latitude and 77° in longitude.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-eisemann-23) They appear stationary in the sky, which eliminates the need for ground stations to have movable antennas. This means that Earth-based observers can erect small, cheap and stationary antennas that are always directed at the desired satellite.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-smad-24): 537  However, [latency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latency_(engineering) "Latency (engineering)") becomes significant as it takes about 240 ms for a signal to pass from a ground based transmitter on the equator to the satellite and back again.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-smad-24): 538  This delay presents problems for latency-sensitive applications such as voice communication,[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-25) so geostationary communication satellites are primarily used for unidirectional entertainment and applications where low latency alternatives are not available.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-wiley-26)

Geostationary satellites are directly overhead at the equator and appear lower in the sky to an observer nearer the poles. As the observer's latitude increases, communication becomes more difficult due to factors such as [atmospheric refraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_refraction "Atmospheric refraction"), Earth's [thermal emission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation "Thermal radiation"), line-of-sight obstructions, and signal reflections from the ground or nearby structures. At latitudes above about 81°, geostationary satellites are below the horizon and cannot be seen at all.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-eisemann-23) Because of this, some [Russian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia "Russia") communication satellites have used [elliptical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_orbit "Elliptic orbit")[Molniya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molniya_orbit "Molniya orbit") and [Tundra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tundra_orbit "Tundra orbit") orbits, which have excellent visibility at high latitudes.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-seh-27)

A worldwide network of operational [geostationary meteorological satellites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_meteorological_satellite "Geostationary meteorological satellite") is used to provide visible and [infrared images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermographic_camera "Thermographic camera") of Earth's surface and atmosphere for weather observation, [oceanography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanography "Oceanography"), and atmospheric tracking. As of 2019 there are 19 satellites in either operation or stand-by.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-28) These satellite systems include:

*   the United States' [GOES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_Operational_Environmental_Satellite "Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite") series, operated by [NOAA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration "National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration")[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-29)
*   the [Meteosat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteosat "Meteosat") series, launched by the [European Space Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Space_Agency "European Space Agency") and operated by the European Weather Satellite Organization, [EUMETSAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EUMETSAT "EUMETSAT")[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-auto-30)
*   the Republic of Korea [COMS-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chollian "Chollian") and[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-LK-31)[GK-2A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEO-KOMPSAT_2A "GEO-KOMPSAT 2A") multi mission satellites.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-32)
*   the Russian [Elektro-L](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elektro-L "Elektro-L") satellites
*   the Japanese [Himawari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himawari_(satellite) "Himawari (satellite)") series[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-33)
*   Chinese [Fengyun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fengyun "Fengyun") series[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-34)
*   India's [INSAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Satellite_System "Indian National Satellite System") series[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-isro-35)

These satellites typically capture images in the visual and infrared spectrum with a spatial resolution between 0.5 and 4 square kilometres.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-bomm-36) The coverage is typically 70°,[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-bomm-36) and in some cases less.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-37)

Geostationary satellite imagery has been used for tracking [volcanic ash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanic_ash "Volcanic ash"),[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-38) measuring cloud top temperatures and water vapour, [oceanography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_Ocean_Color_Imager "Geostationary Ocean Color Imager"),[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-39) measuring land temperature and vegetation coverage,[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-40)[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-noaa-41) facilitating [cyclone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclone "Cyclone") path prediction,[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-isro-35) and providing real time cloud coverage and other tracking data.[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-42) Some information has been incorporated into [meteorological prediction models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_weather_prediction "Numerical weather prediction"), but due to their wide field of view, full-time monitoring and lower resolution, geostationary weather satellite images are primarily used for short-term and real-time forecasting.[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-43)[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-noaa-41)

[![Image 4](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/SBAS_Service_Areas.png/500px-SBAS_Service_Areas.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:SBAS_Service_Areas.png)

Service areas of satellite-based augmentation systems (SBAS).[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-gmv-21)

Geostationary satellites can be used to augment [GNSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNSS "GNSS") systems by relaying [clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_analysis_for_the_Global_Positioning_System#Ephemeris_and_clock_errors "Error analysis for the Global Positioning System"), [ephemeris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_analysis_for_the_Global_Positioning_System#Ephemeris_and_clock_errors "Error analysis for the Global Positioning System") and [ionospheric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_analysis_for_the_Global_Positioning_System#Atmospheric_effects "Error analysis for the Global Positioning System") error corrections (calculated from ground stations of a known position) and providing an additional reference signal.[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-44) This improves position accuracy from approximately 5m to 1m or less.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-45)

Past and current navigation systems that use geostationary satellites include:

*   The [Wide Area Augmentation System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_Area_Augmentation_System "Wide Area Augmentation System") (WAAS), operated by the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States")[Federal Aviation Administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration "Federal Aviation Administration") (FAA);
*   The [European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Geostationary_Navigation_Overlay_Service "European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service") (EGNOS), operated by the [ESSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=European_Satellite_Services_Provider&action=edit&redlink=1 "European Satellite Services Provider (page does not exist)") (on behalf of [EU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EU "EU")'s [GSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_GNSS_Agency "European GNSS Agency"));
*   The [Multi-functional Satellite Augmentation System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-functional_Satellite_Augmentation_System "Multi-functional Satellite Augmentation System") (MSAS), operated by [Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan "Japan")'s [Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Land,_Infrastructure,_Transport_and_Tourism "Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism")[Japan Civil Aviation Bureau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_Civil_Aviation_Bureau "Japan Civil Aviation Bureau") (JCAB);
*   The [GPS Aided Geo Augmented Navigation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_Aided_Geo_Augmented_Navigation "GPS Aided Geo Augmented Navigation") (GAGAN) system being operated by [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India "India").[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-46)[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-47)
*   The commercial [StarFire navigation system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StarFire_(navigation_system) "StarFire (navigation system)"), operated by [John Deere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deere_%26_Company "Deere & Company") and [C-Nav](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=C-Nav&action=edit&redlink=1 "C-Nav (page does not exist)") Positioning Solutions ([Oceaneering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceaneering "Oceaneering"));

[![Image 5](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/Animation_of_EchoStar_XVII_trajectory.gif/250px-Animation_of_EchoStar_XVII_trajectory.gif)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Animation_of_EchoStar_XVII_trajectory.gif)

[![Image 6](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Animation_of_EchoStar_XVII_trajectory_Equatorial_view.gif/250px-Animation_of_EchoStar_XVII_trajectory_Equatorial_view.gif)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Animation_of_EchoStar_XVII_trajectory_Equatorial_view.gif)

Geostationary satellites are launched to the east into a prograde orbit that matches the rotation rate of the equator. The smallest inclination that a satellite can be launched into is that of the launch site's latitude, so launching the satellite from close to the equator limits the amount of [inclination change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_inclination_change "Orbital inclination change") needed later.[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-conf-49) Additionally, launching from close to the equator allows the speed of the Earth's rotation to give the satellite a boost. A launch site should have water or deserts to the east, so any failed rockets do not fall on a populated area.[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-50)

Most [launch vehicles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_vehicle "Launch vehicle") place geostationary satellites directly into a [geostationary transfer orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_transfer_orbit "Geostationary transfer orbit") (GTO), an elliptical orbit with an [apogee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsis "Apsis") at GEO height and a low [perigee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsis "Apsis"). On-board satellite propulsion is then used to raise the perigee, circularise and reach GEO.[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-conf-49)[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-51)

Satellites in geostationary orbit must all occupy a single ring above the [equator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equator "Equator"). The requirement to space these satellites apart, to avoid harmful radio-frequency interference during operations, means that there are a limited number of orbital slots available, and thus only a limited number of satellites can be operated in geostationary orbit. This has led to conflict between different countries wishing access to the same orbital slots (countries near the same [longitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude "Longitude") but differing [latitudes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitudes "Latitudes")) and [radio frequencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_frequencies "Radio frequencies"). These disputes are addressed through the [International Telecommunication Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Telecommunication_Union "International Telecommunication Union")'s allocation mechanism under the [Radio Regulations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITU_Radio_Regulations "ITU Radio Regulations").[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-52)[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-53) In the 1976 [Bogota Declaration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogota_Declaration "Bogota Declaration"), eight countries located on the Earth's equator claimed sovereignty over the geostationary orbits above their territory, but the claims gained no international recognition.[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-54)

A [statite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statite "Statite") is a hypothetical satellite that uses [radiation pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_pressure#Solar_radiation_pressure "Radiation pressure") from the sun against a [solar sail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_sail "Solar sail") to modify its orbit.

It would hold its location over the dark side of the Earth at a latitude of approximately 30 degrees. A statite is stationary relative to the Earth and Sun system rather than compared to surface of the Earth, and could ease congestion in the geostationary ring.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-55)[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-56)

[Geostationary satellites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_satellite "Geostationary satellite") require some [station keeping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_station-keeping "Orbital station-keeping") to keep their position, and once they run out of thruster fuel they are generally retired. The [transponders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transponder_(satellite_communications) "Transponder (satellite communications)") and other onboard systems often outlive the thruster fuel and by allowing the satellite to move naturally into an inclined geosynchronous orbit some satellites can remain in use,[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-57) or else be elevated to a [graveyard orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graveyard_orbit "Graveyard orbit"). This process is becoming increasingly regulated and satellites must have a 90% chance of moving over 200 km above the geostationary belt at end of life.[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-58)

A computer-generated image from 2005 showing the distribution of mostly space debris in [geocentric orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentric_orbit "Geocentric orbit") with two areas of concentration: geostationary orbit and low Earth orbit.

Space debris at geostationary orbits typically has a lower collision speed than at [low Earth orbit (LEO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit "Low Earth orbit") since all GEO satellites orbit in the same plane, altitude and speed; however, the presence of satellites in [eccentric orbits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_eccentricity "Orbital eccentricity") allows for collisions at up to 4 km/s (14,400 km/h; 8,900 mph). Although a collision is comparatively unlikely, GEO satellites have a limited ability to avoid any debris.[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-59)

At geosynchronous altitude, objects less than 10 cm in diameter cannot be seen from the Earth, making it difficult to assess their prevalence.[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-telk1-60)

Despite efforts to reduce risk, spacecraft collisions have occurred. The [European Space Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Space_Agency "European Space Agency") telecom satellite [Olympus-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympus-1 "Olympus-1") was struck by a [meteoroid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteoroid "Meteoroid") on August 11, 1993, and eventually moved to a [graveyard orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graveyard_orbit "Graveyard orbit"),[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-The_Olympus_failure-61) and in 2006 the Russian [Express-AM11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Express_(satellite) "Express (satellite)") communications satellite was struck by an unknown object and rendered inoperable,[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-srdc20060419-62) although its engineers had enough contact time with the satellite to send it into a graveyard orbit. In 2017, both [AMC-9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMC-9 "AMC-9") and [Telkom-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telkom-1 "Telkom-1") broke apart from an unknown cause.[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-63)[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-telk1-60)[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-64)

A typical geostationary orbit has the following properties:

*   Inclination: 0°
*   Period: 1436 minutes (one [sidereal day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidereal_day "Sidereal day"))[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-smad-24): 121 
*   Eccentricity: 0
*   Argument of perigee: undefined
*   [Semi-major axis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-major_and_semi-minor_axes#Astronomy "Semi-major and semi-minor axes"): 42,164 km

An inclination of zero ensures that the orbit remains over the equator at all times, making it stationary with respect to latitude from the point of view of a ground observer (and in the [Earth-centered Earth-fixed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECEF "ECEF") reference frame).[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-smad-24): 122

The orbital period is equal to exactly one sidereal day. This means that the satellite will return to the same point above the Earth's surface every (sidereal) day, regardless of other orbital properties. For a geostationary orbit in particular, it ensures that it holds the same longitude over time.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-smad-24): 121  This orbital period, _T_, is directly related to the semi-major axis of the orbit through [Kepler's Third Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_laws "Kepler's laws"):

![Image 8: {\displaystyle T=2\pi {\sqrt {a^{3} \over \mu }}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1385eed5863f0e40f86905c95cd3d4af7788ce9e)
where:

*   a is the length of the orbit's semi-major axis
*   μ is the [standard gravitational parameter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_gravitational_parameter "Standard gravitational parameter") of the central body[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-smad-24): 137 

The [eccentricity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_eccentricity "Orbital eccentricity") is zero, which produces a [circular orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_orbit "Circular orbit"). This ensures that the satellite does not move closer or further away from the Earth, which would cause it to track backwards and forwards across the sky.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-smad-24): 122

A geostationary orbit can be achieved only at an altitude very close to 35,786 kilometres (22,236 miles) and directly above the equator. This equates to an orbital speed of 3.07 kilometres per second (1.91 miles per second) and an orbital period of 1,436 minutes, one [sidereal day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidereal_day "Sidereal day"). This ensures that the satellite will match the Earth's rotational period and has a stationary [footprint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Footprint_(satellite) "Footprint (satellite)") on the ground. All geostationary satellites have to be located on this ring.

A combination of [lunar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon "Moon") gravity, [solar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun "Sun") gravity, and the [flattening of the Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equatorial_bulge#On_Earth "Equatorial bulge") at its poles causes a [precession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precession "Precession") motion of the orbital plane of any geostationary object, with an [orbital period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_period "Orbital period") of about 53 years and an initial inclination gradient of about 0.85° per year, achieving a maximal inclination of 15° after 26.5 years.[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-Anderson2015-65)[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-smad-24): 156  To correct for this [perturbation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perturbation_(astronomy) "Perturbation (astronomy)"), regular [orbital stationkeeping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_stationkeeping "Orbital stationkeeping") maneuvers are necessary, amounting to a [delta-v](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta-v "Delta-v") of approximately 50 m/s per year.[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-iop-66)

A second effect to be taken into account is the longitudinal drift, caused by the asymmetry of the Earth – the equator is slightly elliptical ([equatorial eccentricity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figure_of_the_Earth#Triaxiality_(equatorial_eccentricity) "Figure of the Earth")).[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-smad-24): 156  There are two stable equilibrium points sometimes called "gravitational wells"[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-67) (at 75.3°E and 108°W) and two corresponding unstable points (at 165.3°E and 14.7°W). Any geostationary object placed between the equilibrium points would (without any action) be slowly accelerated towards the stable equilibrium position, causing a periodic longitude variation.[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-Anderson2015-65) The correction of this effect requires [station-keeping maneuvers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_station-keeping#Station-keeping_in_geostationary_orbit "Orbital station-keeping") with a maximal delta-v of about 2 m/s per year, depending on the desired longitude.[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-iop-66)

[Solar wind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_wind "Solar wind") and [radiation pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_pressure "Radiation pressure") also exert small forces on satellites: over time, these cause them to slowly drift away from their prescribed orbits.[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-68)

In the absence of servicing missions from the Earth or a renewable propulsion method, the consumption of thruster propellant for station-keeping places a limitation on the lifetime of the satellite. [Hall-effect thrusters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall-effect_thruster "Hall-effect thruster"), which are currently in use, have the potential to prolong the service life of a satellite by providing high-efficiency [electric propulsion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrically_powered_spacecraft_propulsion "Electrically powered spacecraft propulsion").[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-iop-66)

For circular orbits around a body, the [centripetal force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centripetal_force "Centripetal force") required to maintain the orbit (_F_ c) is equal to the gravitational force acting on the satellite (_F_ g):[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-Pople-71)

![Image 10: {\displaystyle F_{\text{c}}=F_{\text{g}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b4f3d4b71f6ba102a774244c44900ab3699e5c72)
From [Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton")'s [universal law of gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation "Newton's law of universal gravitation"),

![Image 11: {\displaystyle F_{\text{g}}=G{\frac {M_{\text{E}}m_{\text{s}}}{r^{2}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c1b4f990634f7460dfa3060ad7a67e5765183f1b),
where _F_ g is the gravitational force acting between two objects, _M_ E is the mass of the Earth, 5.9736×10 24 kg, _m_ s is the mass of the satellite, _r_ is the distance between the [centers of their masses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_mass "Center of mass"), and _G_ is the [gravitational constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_constant "Gravitational constant"), (6.674 28±0.000 67)×10−11 m 3 kg−1 s−2.[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-Pople-71)

The magnitude of the acceleration, _a_, of a body moving in a circle is given by:

![Image 12: {\displaystyle a={\frac {v^{2}}{r}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0220b1356204c98557a8b60d275196be3e9cf0c1)
where _v_ is the magnitude of the [velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity "Velocity") (i.e. the speed) of the satellite. From [Newton's second law of motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion#Newton's_second_law "Newton's laws of motion"), the centripetal force _F_ c is given by:

![Image 13: {\displaystyle F_{\text{c}}=m_{\text{s}}{\frac {v^{2}}{r}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a75c048d76caf14a4e831ed443718f09efaa8fa1).[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-Pople-71)
As _F_ c = _F_ g,

![Image 14: {\displaystyle m_{\text{s}}{\frac {v^{2}}{r}}=G{\frac {M_{\text{E}}m_{\text{s}}}{r^{2}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f4829941a1d33bb76bf25a6fc89d3f115bb47fb5),
so that

![Image 15: {\displaystyle v^{2}=G{\frac {M_{\text{E}}}{r}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6f7c607fdcbd0fe03210c7815bed8198213877d0)
Replacing _v_ with the equation for the [speed of an object moving around a circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_motion#Uniform_circular_motion "Circular motion") produces:

![Image 16: {\displaystyle \left({\frac {2\pi r}{T}}\right)^{2}=G{\frac {M_{\text{E}}}{r}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2b02f6de80d991f7421a2cd767dc9eec3a1035d4)
where _T_ is the orbital period (i.e. one sidereal day), and is equal to 86 164.090 54 s.[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-72) This gives an equation for _r_:[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-73)

![Image 17: {\displaystyle r={\sqrt[{3}]{\frac {GM_{\text{E}}T^{2}}{4\pi ^{2}}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f82a14e92ba3a8e9c78590fd4acbb436884d19a3)
The product _GM_ E is known with much greater precision than either factor alone; it is known as the [geocentric gravitational constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentric_gravitational_constant "Geocentric gravitational constant")_μ_ = 398 600.4418±0.0008 km 3 s−2. Hence

![Image 18: {\displaystyle r={\sqrt[{3}]{\frac {\mu T^{2}}{4\pi ^{2}}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/43ba4d2a4b1f1550a6c499c350f76d0911ae4384)
The resulting orbital radius is 42,164 kilometres (26,199 miles). Subtracting the [Earth's equatorial radius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_radius "Earth radius"), 6,378 kilometres (3,963 miles), gives the altitude of 35,786 kilometres (22,236 miles).[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-74)

The orbital speed is calculated by multiplying the angular speed by the orbital radius:

![Image 19: {\displaystyle v=\omega r\quad \approx 3074.6~{\text{m/s}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/112ca29e85231ae1de7ab06a441414a17bc76751)
By the same method, we can determine the orbital altitude for any similar pair of bodies, including the [areostationary orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Areostationary_orbit "Areostationary orbit") of an object in relation to [Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars "Mars"), if it is assumed that it is spherical (which it is not entirely).[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-75) The [gravitational constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentric_gravitational_constant "Geocentric gravitational constant")_GM_ (_μ_) for Mars has the value of 42 830 km 3 s−2, its equatorial radius is 3 389.50 km and the known [rotational period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotational_period "Rotational period") (_T_) of the planet is 1.025 956 76 Earth days (88 642.66 s). Using these values, Mars' orbital altitude is equal to 17 039 km.[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#cite_note-76)
