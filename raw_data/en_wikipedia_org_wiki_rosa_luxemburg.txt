1903) ​ Partner Leo Jogiches (1890–1907) Signature Rosa Luxemburg ( / ˈ l ʌ k s əm b ɜːr ɡ / LUK -səm-burg ; [ 1 ] Polish : Róża Luksemburg [ˈruʐa ˈluksɛmburk] ⓘ ; German: [ˈʁoːza ˈlʊksm̩bʊʁk] ⓘ ; born Rozalia Luksenburg ; 5 March 1871 – 15 January 1919) was a Polish and naturalised-German Marxist theorist, philosopher, economist, and revolutionary socialist . A member of the Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania (SDKPiL), the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), and the Communist Party of Germany (KPD), she became a leading theorist of the SPD and a prominent figure in the Second International . An anti-imperialist , anti-militarist , and foremost thinker of democracy within the Marxist tradition, she is best known for her major theoretical work, The Accumulation of Capital (1913), and for her revolutionary leadership of the Spartacus League during the German Revolution of 1918–1919 .

Born in Russian-ruled Poland to a Jewish family, Luxemburg became a German citizen in 1898 through a marriage of convenience . Together with her partner Leo Jogiches , she co-founded the SDKPiL, a party that rejected Polish nationalism and argued that Polish independence could only be achieved through a socialist revolution in Germany, Austria, and Russia. In Germany, she became the foremost leader of the SPD's revolutionary wing, defining the Marxist position on reform in her pamphlet Social Reform or Revolution?

(1900) against the theories of Eduard Bernstein . Drawing lessons from the 1905 Russian Revolution , she developed a theory of the mass strike as the proletariat 's most important revolutionary tool, which brought her into increasing conflict with the SPD's cautious leadership.

Her outspoken opposition to World War I led her to co-found the anti-war Spartacus League , and she was imprisoned for most of the war. From prison, she wrote the influential Junius Pamphlet (1915), condemning the war and the SPD's capitulation to nationalism. She celebrated the Russian Revolution , but in a posthumously published manuscript she sharply criticised the authoritarian policies of the Bolsheviks , championing democratic freedoms and famously stating, "Freedom is always and exclusively freedom for the one who thinks differently." After her release during the German Revolution, Luxemburg co-founded the KPD and was a central figure in the January 1919 Spartacist uprising in Berlin . When the revolt was crushed by the Freikorps , a government-sponsored paramilitary group, Luxemburg, Karl Liebknecht , and other supporters were captured and summarily executed. After her death, her legacy became a subject of intense debate. She has been revered by many on the left as a martyr for the revolution, while her theories, particularly her emphasis on spontaneity and democracy, were sharply criticized by the Leninist and Stalinist traditions of orthodox communism.

Early life (1871–1890) [ edit ] Rozalia Luksenburg was born on 5 March 1871 in Zamość , a town in the Russian-controlled Congress Poland .

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] She was the fifth and youngest child of a moderately well-off, assimilated Jewish family.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] Her father, Elias (or Eduard) Luxemburg, was a timber merchant with a German education who was sympathetic to the Polish national movement.

[ 6 ] [ 3 ] Her mother, Lina Löwenstein, was descended from a long line of rabbis .

[ 3 ] The family was committed to the values of the Haskalah , the Jewish enlightenment movement, and embraced progressive European culture.

[ 5 ] The family had largely abandoned a conscious Jewish life; they spoke Polish and German at home, and Rosa, like her four siblings, received a secular education.

[ 7 ] She had a complex relationship with her Jewish identity; while proud of her heritage, she rejected any specific Jewish political cause, stating later in life: "I have no special place in my heart for the [Jewish] ghetto . I feel at home in the entire world wherever there are clouds and birds and human tears." [ 8 ] [ 9 ] Rory Castle writes: From her grandfather and father [Rosa] inherited the belief that she was a Pole first and a Jew second, with her emotional connection to the Polish language and culture and her passionate opposition to Tsarism being of central importance. Although her parents were religious, they did not consider themselves to be Jewish by nationality, rather 'Poles of the Mosaic persuasion'.

[ 10 ] In 1873, the family moved to Warsaw to seek better business opportunities, a better education for their children, and to escape the ever-present anti-Jewish sentiment and Orthodox - Hasidic dominance in Zamość.

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] At age five, Luxemburg developed a hip disease, probably a congenital hip dislocation . It was misdiagnosed as tuberculosis and resulted in a year-long confinement in a cast, during which she taught herself to read and write.

[ 13 ] The illness left her with a permanent limp, a condition that deeply affected her and which she later blamed her parents for not detecting earlier.

[ 11 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] Luxemburg at about age 12, c.

1883 In 1880, she enrolled at the Second Girls' High School in Warsaw.

[ 15 ] Admission for Jewish students was subject to a quota, a humiliation which intensified her sense of being an outsider.

[ 15 ] The school was an instrument of Russification , forbidding the use of Polish.

[ 16 ] The 1881 Warsaw pogrom , which her family experienced, left her with a permanent fear of mob violence.

[ 17 ] In response to this frightening reality, she found refuge in the poetry of the Polish Romantic Adam Mickiewicz , whose appeal to rebellion and dreams of universal freedom became a source of inspiration.

[ 18 ] During this time, Luxemburg became involved in clandestine student circles associated with the revolutionary Proletariat party.

[ 19 ] [ 20 ] This was the first Polish socialist party, founded in 1882 by Ludwik Waryński . The party was internationalist in outlook, prioritising the economic struggle of the working class over Polish independence.

[ 21 ] By her final year, Luxemburg was known to the authorities as a politically active and rebellious student, and she was denied the gold medal for academic achievement which her scholastic merits had earned.

[ 19 ] After graduating in 1887, she continued her revolutionary activities.

[ 22 ] She was part of a cell of the "Second Proletariat ", one of the successor groups to the original party which had been broken up by arrests in the mid-1880s.

[ 19 ] By 1889, threatened with arrest, she was smuggled out of Poland with the help of her mentor, Marcin Kasprzak . According to one account, she was hidden under straw in a peasant's cart and taken across the border by a Catholic priest who had been told she was a Jewish girl fleeing to be baptized.

[ 23 ] [ 24 ] Zurich and early political career (1890–1898) [ edit ] Luxemburg arrived in Zurich in early 1889.

[ 25 ] At the time, Switzerland was the most important centre of Russian and Polish revolutionary Marxism in exile.

[ 26 ] In 1890, she enrolled at the University of Zurich , where women were admitted on an equal footing with men. She initially studied natural sciences and mathematics, but in 1892 she switched to the faculty of law, where she studied public law and political economy under Professor Julius Wolf.

[ 27 ] [ 28 ] Wolf later acknowledged that "she came to me from Poland already as a thorough Marxist".

[ 28 ] Leo Jogiches c.

1890 In early autumn 1890, she met Leo Jogiches , a famous revolutionary from Vilna who had also recently escaped from the Russian Empire.

[ 29 ] They fell in love and by the summer of 1891 had become lovers, beginning a tumultuous fifteen-year relationship that she considered a marriage, referring to him in her letters as her husband.

[ 30 ] Jogiches became the most dominant figure in her personal and political life. Their relationship was a complex fusion of personal intimacy and political collaboration, marked by both deep affection and intense intellectual conflict.

[ 31 ] Jogiches provided the financial support for their activities, while Luxemburg became the partnership's public voice and theorist.

[ 32 ] He insisted on absolute secrecy about their relationship, which Luxemburg alternately rebelled against and accepted.

[ 33 ] Soon after their arrival, Jogiches and Luxemburg came into conflict with the established leadership of Russian Marxism, centred around Georgi Plekhanov in Geneva . Jogiches, with his characteristic self-assurance, proposed a publishing partnership with Plekhanov on equal terms and was promptly rejected.

[ 34 ] The ensuing quarrel isolated them from the main Russian socialist movement and pushed their activities increasingly towards Polish affairs.

[ 35 ] They began to gather a small group of Polish students and exiles around them, including Julian Marchlewski and Adolf Warszawski .

[ 36 ] In 1893, this group founded a new party, the Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland (SDKP), in opposition to the recently unified Polish Socialist Party (PPS).

[ 37 ] [ 38 ] The SDKP's programme, largely formulated by Luxemburg, rejected the PPS's central demand for Polish independence. Instead, it argued for close collaboration with Russian socialists to achieve a revolution in the Russian Empire, within which Poland would have territorial autonomy.

[ 39 ] [ 40 ] At the International's third congress in Zurich in 1893, Luxemburg, as a delegate for the SDKP's newspaper Sprawa Robotnicza ( The Workers' Cause ), had her mandate challenged by the PPS delegation.

[ 41 ] Small and frail, she climbed onto a chair to make herself heard and, with "magnetism in her eyes and in such fiery words", defended her cause.

[ 42 ] Although the congress ultimately voted to reject her mandate, she achieved a moral victory by framing the dispute as one of principle rather than personal rivalry.

[ 43 ] This conflict over the "national question" became the central and most enduring division in Polish socialism. The polemics between the two parties forced both to sharpen their positions: the PPS became more openly nationalist, while the SDKP's opposition to Polish independence became a core doctrine.

[ 44 ] At the next congress in London in 1896, the International passed a compromise resolution supporting the right of all nations to self-determination but without specific mention of Poland.

[ 45 ] In 1897, Luxemburg successfully defended her doctoral dissertation , Die industrielle Entwicklung Polens ( The Industrial Development of Poland ), which argued that the industrial growth of Russian Poland was inextricably linked to the Russian market and that Polish independence was therefore an economic and political negation of progress.

[ 46 ] [ 47 ] She was one of the first women in the world, and the first Polish woman, to be awarded a doctorate in political economy.

[ 48 ] [ 49 ] To obtain German citizenship and the ability to work within the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), she entered into a marriage of convenience with Gustav Lübeck, son of her Zurich friend Olympia Lübeck, in April 1898.

[ 50 ] [ 51 ] On 12 May 1898, she moved to Berlin .

[ 52 ] [ 51 ] Despite living in Germany for most of her adult life, Luxemburg remained the principal theoretician of the SDKP (and later SDKPiL), leading the party in a partnership with Jogiches, its principal organiser.

[ 48 ] She was sentimental towards Polish culture, Mickiewicz remained her favourite poet, and she vehemently opposed the Germanisation of Poles in the Prussian Partition ; in 1893, she wrote against the Russification of Poles by the Russian Empire's absolutist government [ 53 ] and in 1900 she published a brochure against the Germanisation of Poles by the Kingdom of Prussia in Poznań .

[ 54 ] Activism in the SPD (1898–1905) [ edit ] Luxemburg c.

1900 Luxemburg arrived in Germany at a pivotal moment for the SPD. After years of operating under the Anti-Socialist Laws , the party had grown into a massive but politically isolated organisation. Its official doctrine, codified in the 1891 Erfurt Program , combined a Marxist prediction of capitalism's inevitable collapse with a practical focus on immediate, minimal reforms.

[ 55 ] This inherent contradiction was brought to the fore by the revisionist controversy, which began in earnest in 1898.

[ 56 ] Eduard Bernstein , a respected party veteran living in London, published a series of articles arguing that many of Marx's predictions were outdated. He proposed that the party should abandon its revolutionary goals and "dare to appear as what it actually was: a democratic Socialist party of reform".

[ 57 ] [ 58 ] Title page of Luxemburg's Social Reform or Revolution?

(1899) Luxemburg immediately plunged into the debate, seeing it as a crucial opportunity to establish her career and defend what she saw as the core of Marxism.

[ 59 ] She became a leading voice of the party's revolutionary left, along with Alexander Parvus .

[ 60 ] Her most significant contribution was the pamphlet Social Reform or Revolution?

, first published as a series of articles in the Leipziger Volkszeitung in late 1898 and early 1899.

[ 61 ] [ 62 ] In it, she argued that the distinction between social reform and social revolution was a false one for a revolutionary party.

[ 61 ] [ 63 ] The daily struggle for reforms, she contended, was the only way for the proletariat to develop the class consciousness necessary for the revolutionary seizure of power. To abandon the final goal of revolution would be to sever practice from theory, transforming the socialist movement into a mere reformist, petit-bourgeois party.

[ 64 ] [ 65 ] She dismantled Bernstein's economic arguments, reasserting the Marxist theses of capitalist crisis and collapse.

[ 66 ] The pamphlet established her reputation as a major theorist and the "hammer of revisionism".

[ 67 ] At the party congresses of 1898, 1899, and 1901, Luxemburg was a prominent speaker, crossing swords not only with revisionists but also with the party leadership, which she often saw as too accommodating.

[ 68 ] She formed a close intellectual and personal alliance with Karl Kautsky , the party's leading theorist, and his wife Luise .

[ 69 ] [ 70 ] Together with Kautsky, she led the "orthodox" Marxist camp against Bernstein, though her approach was always more radical and action-oriented than Kautsky's more academic defence of principles.

[ 71 ] By 1903, the revisionist challenge had been officially defeated within the party, and the orthodox line was resoundingly confirmed at the 1904 Amsterdam congress of the Second International.

[ 72 ] [ 73 ] Throughout this period, Luxemburg led a dual political life, maintaining her central role in the SDKP while becoming a major figure in the SPD.

[ 74 ] She deliberately kept her German and Polish activities separate, a division facilitated by Jogiches's insistence on conspiratorial methods.

[ 74 ] From her base in Berlin, she directed much of the SDKP's strategy, particularly its unrelenting campaign against the PPS in Germany and in the International.

[ 75 ] In 1899, the SDKP merged with a group of Lithuanian social democrats led by Felix Dzerzhinsky , becoming the Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania (SDKPiL).

[ 76 ] [ 77 ] Her influence and the support of the SPD leadership were instrumental in establishing the SDKPiL as a recognised, albeit small, force in international socialism.

[ 78 ] 1905 Revolution and aftermath (1905–1911) [ edit ] Role in the 1905 Revolution [ edit ] The 1905 Russian Revolution erupted dramatically in January and had a profound impact on Luxemburg's thought and activity.

[ 79 ] [ 80 ] The wave of mass strikes, peasant uprisings, and military mutinies that swept across the Russian Empire, including Poland, seemed to confirm her revolutionary predictions. She immediately began to analyse the events for the German and Polish socialist press, calling the revolution a "dress rehearsal" for a future upheaval.

[ 81 ] [ 82 ] In her articles, she celebrated the mass strike as the central weapon of the revolution, a form of action that fused the economic and political struggles and spontaneously raised the class consciousness of the proletariat.

[ 83 ] Mugshot taken after Luxemburg's arrest in Warsaw, 1906 As the revolution in Poland intensified, her position in Berlin became increasingly untenable. Feeling isolated from the "real revolution", she decided to go to Warsaw.

[ 84 ] Her relationship with Jogiches had entered a period of crisis, triggered in part by a brief affair she had with another revolutionary, which she confessed to Jogiches in August 1905.

[ 85 ] Despite warnings from her German and Polish colleagues about the dangers, she left Berlin on 28 December 1905, travelling on false papers under the name Anna Matschke.

[ 86 ] [ 87 ] [ 88 ] In Warsaw, she joined Jogiches and other SDKPiL leaders, plunging into the heart of the revolutionary turmoil. She wrote prolifically for the party's newspapers, helped to formulate its programme, and participated in clandestine meetings.

[ 89 ] However, her stay was short-lived. On 4 March 1906, she and Jogiches were arrested in a police raid.

[ 90 ] [ 91 ] [ 92 ] Luxemburg was imprisoned for four months, first in the Town Hall jail, then in the Pawiak prison, and finally in the notorious Pavilion X of the Warsaw Citadel .

[ 93 ] Her health deteriorated rapidly, but her spirits remained high. Through the combined efforts of her family and the German SPD, including a bail of 3,000 roubles paid by her brother Jozef, she was released on 28 July 1906.

[ 94 ] [ 91 ] [ 95 ] Forbidden to leave Warsaw, she spent the next month arranging her departure. She eventually left for Kuokkala , Finland, where she joined Vladimir Lenin and other Bolshevik leaders for several weeks of discussion about the lessons of the revolution.

[ 96 ] [ 91 ] [ 97 ] Mass strike doctrine and SPD Party School [ edit ] The experience of the 1905 revolution became the foundation for Luxemburg's most influential work on revolutionary strategy, the pamphlet The Mass Strike, the Political Party and the Trade Unions , written in Finland and published in Germany in 1906.

[ 98 ] [ 99 ] [ 100 ] In it, she generalized from the Russian experience, arguing that the mass strike was not a single, isolated act but a continuous process, a period of heightened class struggle in which the economic and political spheres were inseparable. It was, she argued, a spontaneous expression of the revolutionary energy of the masses, which the party could not artificially "make" but must lead and give political direction.

[ 101 ] [ 102 ] The pamphlet was a direct challenge to the German trade union leadership, which saw the mass strike as a threat to their organizations and a recipe for "revolutionary romanticism".

[ 103 ] At the 1906 SPD congress in Mannheim , a major confrontation occurred between the party's revolutionary wing, represented by Luxemburg, and the trade union leaders led by Carl Legien . Luxemburg passionately defended the lessons of the Russian revolution, but the congress ultimately passed a resolution that effectively gave the trade unions a veto over any future mass strike action.

[ 104 ] A similar debate took place at the 1907 International congress in Stuttgart , where an amendment drafted by Luxemburg, Lenin, and Julius Martov was attached to the main resolution on war and militarism. It committed the socialist parties not only to prevent war but also to use any war crisis to "hasten the abolition of capitalist class rule".

[ 105 ] [ 106 ] Luxemburg (fourth from left against bookcase) among attendees at the SPD party school in 1907 The years from 1907 to 1910 were a period of relative political quietism for Luxemburg in Germany. Following the SPD's electoral defeat in the 1907 "Hottentot elections" , the party leadership became increasingly cautious and resistant to radical tactics.

[ 107 ] Disillusioned with the party's direction, Luxemburg withdrew from day-to-day agitation and focused on her theoretical work and teaching.

[ 108 ] In October 1907, she became a lecturer in political economy and economic history at the SPD's new Central Party School in Berlin, a post she held until 1914.

[ 109 ] [ 110 ] The school was intended to train an elite of party and trade union functionaries. Luxemburg was an enthusiastic and highly successful teacher, known for her Socratic method of questioning students to help them develop "an airtight solution" for themselves. Her lectures formed the basis for two of her major economic works, Introduction to Political Economy and The Accumulation of Capital .

[ 98 ] [ 111 ] This period also marked the definitive end of Luxemburg's relationship with Jogiches. He crossed the border illegally and arrived in Berlin in April 1907, only to be told their relationship was over. His violent reaction, including threats to kill her, shocked and frightened her.

[ 112 ] Luxemburg had already begun a new relationship with Konstantin (Kostja) Zetkin , the 22-year-old son of her close friend and comrade Clara Zetkin .

[ 113 ] [ 114 ] The separation from Jogiches left her emotionally devastated.

[ 115 ] Break with Kautsky [ edit ] Luxemburg (near centre, wearing bow) and Karl Kautsky (back row, third from right) at the Amsterdam Congress of the Second International , 1904 The temporary truce in the SPD between the radicals and the leadership ended abruptly in 1910 over the question of Prussian suffrage. The Prussian three-class franchise was a long-standing grievance, and a new government bill that failed to introduce equal suffrage sparked a wave of mass demonstrations and strikes.

[ 116 ] Luxemburg saw this as a golden opportunity to put her mass strike theory into practice and to push the party in a more revolutionary direction.

[ 117 ] She embarked on an intensive speaking tour, and in a series of articles, beginning with "What Next?", she called for the party to escalate the struggle, including through republican agitation.

[ 118 ] The party executive, however, was wary of such radical tactics, fearing they would alienate bourgeois allies and jeopardize the upcoming Reichstag elections. Kautsky, now the chief defender of the party's cautious "strategy of attrition" ( Ermattungsstrategie ), refused to publish her article in Die Neue Zeit .

[ 119 ] This refusal marked the beginning of a bitter and public polemic between the two former allies, which permanently destroyed their friendship and intellectual partnership.

[ 120 ] [ 121 ] [ 122 ] Luxemburg accused Kautsky of cowardice and of abandoning Marxist principles for parliamentary expediency. Kautsky, in turn, portrayed her as a reckless adventurer whose "rebel's impatience" threatened to lead the party to ruin.

[ 123 ] The controversy effectively ended Luxemburg's influence with the SPD's centrist leadership. She was now increasingly isolated, a leader of a small but growing radical opposition within the party.

[ 124 ] Although her resolution on the mass strike was defeated at the 1910 Magdeburg congress, the debate had drawn a clear line between her revolutionary strategy and the executive's policy of waiting for history to run its course.

[ 125 ] The conflict intensified in 1911 during the Agadir Crisis , when she again clashed with the leadership over what she saw as their passive and inadequate response to the threat of imperialist war.

[ 126 ] [ 127 ] Theorist of imperialism (1911–1914) [ edit ] Luxemburg in 1912 The years before the outbreak of World War I were marked by Luxemburg's growing alienation from the SPD's leadership and her development of a comprehensive theory of imperialism .

[ 128 ] The party's electoral victory in 1912 , which made it the largest party in the Reichstag, was followed by an electoral pact with the liberal Progressive Party in the run-off elections. When the Progressives failed to reciprocate the SPD's support, Luxemburg launched a scathing critique, arguing that "real class interests are stronger than any 'arrangements'".

[ 129 ] For her, the episode demonstrated the futility of parliamentary tactics and the naive belief in alliances with bourgeois parties.

[ 130 ] She became increasingly disillusioned with the parliamentary group's growing influence, which she saw as corroding the party's revolutionary spirit.

[ 131 ] This period of opposition culminated in her major theoretical work, The Accumulation of Capital , published in 1913. The book originated from her teaching at the SPD party school and her attempt to resolve a technical problem in Marx's theory of capitalist reproduction.

[ 132 ] [ 133 ] Her central thesis was that capitalism, as a closed system, could not realise the surplus value it generated and was therefore dependent on a constant expansion into non-capitalist economies and social strata for its survival and accumulation. This "cannibalization" of pre-capitalist societies was, for Luxemburg, the economic root of imperialism.

[ 134 ] [ 133 ] [ 135 ] The book was a monumental effort, which she later claimed to have written in an ecstatic state in just four months.

[ 136 ] [ 133 ] The book's reception was overwhelmingly negative, even from the left, but it established her reputation as a brilliant, if unorthodox, theorist and provided the intellectual foundation for her intensifying struggle against imperialism.

[ 137 ] [ 138 ] Luxemburg's anti-militarist agitation also brought her into direct conflict with the state. In September 1913, she gave a speech in Bockenheim , near Frankfurt , in which she called on German workers to refuse to take up arms against their "French and other brethren".

[ 139 ] She was charged with inciting soldiers to mutiny and tried in February 1914. She used the trial as a platform to launch a political assault on militarism and the ruling class, turning her defence into an indictment of the society that was prosecuting her.

[ 140 ] [ 141 ] Sentenced to a year in prison, she embarked on a whistle-stop speaking tour while her appeal was pending, drawing large and sympathetic crowds.

[ 142 ] A second trial for insulting the army followed, based on her allegations of routine abuse of soldiers in the German military. The authorities, hoping to make a test case, were flooded with evidence of such maltreatment, and the trial was eventually adjourned indefinitely.

[ 143 ] These trials raised Luxemburg's public profile to a height not seen since 1910 and rallied a growing opposition around the banner of anti-militarism.

[ 144 ] During the trials, she began a brief but intense affair with her lawyer, Paul Levi .

[ 145 ] World War I (1914–1918) [ edit ] Luxemburg in 1910 The outbreak of World War I in August 1914 and the subsequent collapse of the Second International was the defining catastrophe of Luxemburg's political life. On 4 August, the SPD's Reichstag delegation voted unanimously for war credits , a decision that signified the capitulation of European social democracy to nationalism.

[ 146 ] Luxemburg, who was in Berlin, was devastated.

[ 147 ] Together with Karl Liebknecht , Clara Zetkin , Franz Mehring and a small circle of friends, she immediately began to organize an opposition.

[ 147 ] [ 148 ] On 10 September 1914, they issued their first public declaration against the party's policy, disassociating themselves from the SPD leadership and calling for a new International.

[ 149 ] This group, initially known as the Gruppe Internationale, became the nucleus of the Spartacus League (Spartakusbund).

Most of the war Luxemburg spent in prison. Her sentence from the 1914 Frankfurt trial was executed, and she was imprisoned from February 1915 to February 1916.

[ 150 ] [ 151 ] [ 152 ] After only a few months of freedom, during which she was a central figure in the Spartacist opposition, she was re-arrested in July 1916 and held in "protective custody" without trial, first in Warsaw and then in Breslau , until her release during the November 1918 revolution.

[ 153 ] Imprisonment and writings [ edit ] Prison became a period of intense intellectual and personal activity for Luxemburg. Though cut off from direct political action, she maintained a prolific correspondence with her friends, particularly Clara Zetkin, Luise Kautsky, and Sophie Liebknecht .

[ 154 ] In her letters to a new set of confidantes, including Mathilde Jacob , who acted as her link to the outside world, she revealed her vulnerability, her deep love of nature, and her profound empathy for the suffering of others.

[ 155 ] While in her cell, she collected flowers and plants during her walks, studied botany, and cared for injured animals, once nursing a disabled pigeon back to health.

[ 156 ] She famously wrote to Sophie Liebknecht about her encounter with abused Romanian buffaloes in the prison yard, an episode that crystallized for her the intertwined cruelty of war and the human capacity for empathy.

[ 157 ] From prison, she also continued her political work, smuggling out articles and pamphlets that became the theoretical touchstones of the Spartacus League. The most famous of these was the Junius Pamphlet (officially The Crisis of Social Democracy ), written in 1915 and illegally distributed in 1916.

[ 158 ] [ 159 ] [ 160 ] In it, she delivered a devastating analysis of the war as an imperialist conflict for which all sides were responsible and a searing indictment of the SPD's betrayal. She argued that in the age of imperialism, national wars of defence were no longer possible and that the only alternative for the proletariat was international class struggle against the war, summed up in the slogan "socialism or barbarism".

[ 161 ] [ 162 ] The Russian Revolution of 1917 was a source of both hope and profound concern for Luxemburg. She celebrated the overthrow of Tsarism but became increasingly critical of the Bolsheviks after they seized power in October . In a manuscript written in her Breslau prison in 1918 (published posthumously by Paul Levi in 1922 as The Russian Revolution ), she offered a comradely but sharp critique of Bolshevik policy.

[ 163 ] [ 164 ] [ 165 ] While praising Lenin and Leon Trotsky for having the courage to make a revolution, she condemned their resort to terror , their suppression of the Constituent Assembly , and their abolition of democratic freedoms like the freedom of the press and assembly . She famously argued that "Freedom is always and exclusively freedom for the one who thinks differently." [ 166 ] [ 167 ] [ 168 ] She also criticised their agrarian policy and their policy of national self-determination, which she believed had weakened the revolution and opened the door to German imperialism.

[ 169 ] [ 170 ] For Luxemburg, the Bolsheviks' errors stemmed from the isolation of the Russian Revolution, which could only be saved by a successful proletarian revolution in Germany and the West.

[ 171 ] [ 172 ] [ 168 ] German Revolution and death [ edit ] Luxemburg was released from prison on 9 November 1918, in the midst of the German Revolution of 1918–1919 . Her hair had turned white, and her health had deteriorated.

[ 173 ] [ 174 ] She travelled immediately to Berlin and plunged into the revolutionary turmoil.

[ 175 ] Together with Karl Liebknecht, she took over the leadership of the Spartacus League and began publishing its daily newspaper, Die Rote Fahne ( The Red Flag ).

[ 176 ] [ 177 ] [ 178 ] She forcefully articulated the Spartacist programme: the overthrow of the provisional government of Friedrich Ebert , the disarming of the counter-revolutionary troops, and the transfer of all power to the workers' and soldiers' councils .

[ 179 ] At the turn of the year, from 30 December 1918 to 1 January 1919, the Spartacus League, along with other radical groups, founded the Communist Party of Germany (KPD).

[ 180 ] [ 181 ] [ 182 ] In her programme speech to the founding congress, Luxemburg laid out her vision of revolution. She rejected both a Blanquist -style seizure of power by a minority and a purely parliamentary path to socialism. Revolution, she argued, must be the work of the masses themselves, a protracted process of class struggle from below, in which the workers would learn to wield power through their own action and experience.

[ 183 ] Although she and the other leaders advised participation in the upcoming elections for a National Assembly , the congress, dominated by young and impatient radicals, voted against their advice.

[ 184 ] [ 185 ] Spartacist uprising and murder [ edit ] 1919 photo of the graves of Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht In early January 1919, a second revolutionary wave swept Berlin. The dismissal of the popular but radical police chief of Berlin, Emil Eichhorn , by the Ebert government sparked a mass demonstration on 5 January, organized by the Revolutionary Shop Stewards , the left-wing of the Independent Social Democrats (USPD), and the KPD.

[ 186 ] [ 187 ] [ 188 ] The demonstration was far larger than expected, and a Revolutionary Committee, including Liebknecht, was hastily formed to lead the movement.

[ 189 ] This so-called Spartacist uprising was not a planned putsch by the KPD. Luxemburg initially thought it a mistake, believing the moment was not yet ripe for an overthrow of the government, but once the masses were on the streets, she felt it was the duty of revolutionaries to support them.

[ 190 ] [ 188 ] In Die Rote Fahne , she passionately urged the workers on.

The government, led by Ebert and his defence minister Gustav Noske , moved decisively to crush the revolt. They employed the Freikorps , newly formed right-wing paramilitary units composed of demobilised soldiers and officers, to suppress the uprising.

[ 180 ] [ 191 ] [ 192 ] By 13 January, the fighting was largely over and the revolt crushed. The Spartacist leaders went into hiding. On the evening of 15 January, Luxemburg and Liebknecht were discovered in an apartment in the Wilmersdorf district of Berlin and arrested by Freikorps soldiers.

[ 193 ] [ 194 ] [ 195 ] They were taken to the Eden Hotel, the headquarters of the Garde-Kavallerie-Schützen-Division . There, they were interrogated and tortured. Liebknecht was taken out first, shot, and delivered to a mortuary as an "unidentified man". Luxemburg was then led out. A soldier named Otto Runge struck her on the head with his rifle butt as she left the hotel; she fell, was struck again, and then bundled into a car.

[ 196 ] She was shot in the head, and her body, weighted with stones, was thrown into the Landwehr Canal .

[ 197 ] [ 196 ] Her body was not found until 31 May 1919.

[ 198 ] [ 199 ] The murders provoked widespread outrage in Germany and abroad. The subsequent military trials of the perpetrators were widely seen as a sham; the main instigator, Captain Waldemar Pabst , was never charged, and Runge received a two-year sentence.

She was a firm believer in the dialectical materialism of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels , viewing history as a dynamic process and insisting on the inseparability of theory and practice.

[ 202 ] Revolutionary socialism and critique of reformism [ edit ] Luxemburg's most famous contribution to political theory was her intervention in the revisionist debate in the SPD at the turn of the 20th century. In her 1900 pamphlet Social Reform or Revolution?

, she mounted a defence of orthodox Marxism against the reformist theories of Eduard Bernstein .

[ 61 ] Bernstein had argued that capitalism had adapted and was not heading for an inevitable collapse, and that socialists should therefore abandon the goal of revolution and work for gradual, piecemeal reforms within the existing system.

[ 57 ] Luxemburg argued that this presented a false choice between reform and revolution. For her, the two were dialectically linked: the daily struggle for reforms (such as the eight-hour day or improved trade union rights) was the only means by which the proletariat could become conscious of its class power and prepare itself for the revolutionary seizure of power.

[ 64 ] [ 203 ] To abandon the final goal of revolution, she argued, was to transform the socialist movement into a petit-bourgeois reformist party, severing its practical activity from its ultimate purpose and effectively accepting the permanence of capitalism. The fight for reforms was the means of the class struggle; the social revolution was its aim.

[ 204 ] Mass strike, spontaneity, and the role of the party [ edit ] Luxemburg addressing a crowd in Stuttgart in 1907 Drawing on the experience of the 1905 Russian Revolution , Luxemburg developed her theory of the mass strike as the most important weapon in the proletarian struggle. In her 1906 pamphlet The Mass Strike, the Political Party and the Trade Unions , she argued against the SPD and trade union leadership's view of the mass strike as a single, organised, and controllable action.

[ 103 ] Instead, she saw it as the characteristic form of a revolutionary period, a process in which economic and political struggles merged, and in which strikes, demonstrations, and uprisings would flow into one another.

[ 205 ] [ 102 ] This theory is often associated with the concept of "spontaneity". For Luxemburg, spontaneity was not a synonym for disorganisation, but rather the creative, elemental, and often unpredictable energy of the masses in action.

[ 206 ] [ 100 ] The role of the revolutionary party was not to "make" or "call" a mass strike in a top-down, commandist fashion, but to give political leadership, clarity, and direction to the spontaneous movement that arose from the objective conditions of the class struggle.

[ 207 ] This dialectical relationship between the spontaneous action of the masses and the conscious leadership of the party stood in stark contrast to both the bureaucratic caution of the SPD leadership and Vladimir Lenin 's more strictly vanguardist conception of the party.

[ 208 ] [ 209 ] Imperialism, nationalism, and war [ edit ] Title page of Luxemburg's The Accumulation of Capital (1913) Luxemburg's major theoretical work was The Accumulation of Capital (1913), which she presented as a contribution to the economic clarification of imperialism.

[ 210 ] In it, she argued that capitalism was driven by an inherent contradiction: it could not realise the surplus value generated within its own closed system. To survive and continue to accumulate, it was therefore compelled to expand into and exploit pre-capitalist spheres, both within its home countries (e.g., the peasantry and artisan classes) and, more importantly, in colonies abroad.

[ 211 ] [ 133 ] [ 135 ] This ceaseless, competitive drive for control of non-capitalist markets and resources was, for Luxemburg, the economic foundation of imperialism and militarism.

[ 212 ] This economic analysis underpinned her political stance against imperialism and war. She saw imperialism not as a mere policy choice but as the final, global stage of capitalism, which would inevitably lead to ever more destructive wars and ultimately to "barbarism" unless it was overthrown by international socialist revolution.

[ 213 ] [ 162 ] This conviction was the basis for her consistent internationalism and her critique of nationalism, which she saw as a bourgeois ideology used to divide the working class and tie it to the interests of its own ruling class.

[ 37 ] [ 18 ] Her opposition to the "right of nations to self-determination" as a universal slogan, which put her in direct conflict with Lenin, stemmed from this belief. She argued that in the age of imperialism, such a right was a hollow phrase that often served as a cover for the interests of competing imperialist powers.

[ 169 ] [ 214 ] Critique of the Russian Revolution [ edit ] Luxemburg enthusiastically welcomed the Russian Revolution but was deeply critical of the Bolsheviks ' policies after they seized power. In a manuscript written in prison in 1918 and published after her death, she articulated a fundamental critique of the Bolshevik model of revolution.

[ 215 ] [ 216 ] While praising Lenin and Leon Trotsky for their revolutionary courage, she condemned their suppression of the Russian Constituent Assembly , their restriction of suffrage, and their abolition of democratic freedoms.

[ 217 ] [ 170 ] She argued that "without general elections, without unrestricted freedom of press and assembly, without a free struggle of opinion, life dies out in every public institution, becomes a mere semblance of life, in which only the bureaucracy remains as the active element." [ 166 ] Her most famous dictum came from this critique: "Freedom is always and exclusively freedom for the one who thinks differently." [ 166 ] [ 167 ] [ 168 ] For Luxemburg, socialist democracy was not something to be granted as a gift after the revolution had been secured, but was the very medium of the revolution itself—the only way for the masses to learn, correct their mistakes, and exercise power. The substitution of a dictatorship of a party or a committee for the dictatorship of the proletariat would, she feared, lead not to socialism but to a "brutalization of public life".

[ 218 ] She believed the Bolsheviks' errors were a product of the fatal isolation of their revolution, and that its only salvation lay in a successful proletarian revolution in the West, especially in Germany.

[ 219 ] Legacy [ edit ] Memorial to Luxemburg and Liebknecht at the Friedrichsfelde cemetery in Berlin, 1926. It was commissioned by the KPD and later destroyed by the Nazis in 1935.

The murder of Rosa Luxemburg transformed her into a martyr for the revolutionary socialist cause. Her legacy, however, has been a subject of intense debate and political contestation ever since.

[ 220 ] [ 221 ] In the immediate aftermath, the KPD, under the leadership of Paul Levi , revered her as a founder and theorist, and began the process of collecting and publishing her works.

[ 222 ] The debate over "Luxemburgism" as a distinct political tendency began in earnest after Levi published her critical manuscript on the Russian Revolution in 1922.

[ 223 ] [ 224 ] This move, part of an internal party struggle, prompted a sharp response from Lenin. In his famous "chicken and eagle" parable, Lenin praised Luxemburg as a revolutionary "eagle" but enumerated her theoretical "errors"—on the national question, the accumulation of capital, party organisation, and the nature of the state—which he argued must be corrected by the party.

[ 225 ] [ 226 ] This set the template for the official Communist interpretation for decades.

During the " Bolshevisation " of the KPD in the mid-1920s, Luxemburgism was systematically constructed as a coherent but fallacious system of thought, a " syphilis bacillus" that needed to be eradicated.

[ 227 ] The ultra-left faction led by Ruth Fischer and Arkadi Maslow paired Luxemburgism with Trotskyism as a heresy characterised by a theory of "spontaneity" that underestimated the role of the revolutionary party.

[ 228 ] During the Stalin era, this critique hardened into dogma, and Luxemburg's ideas were either ignored or denounced as a "deadly enemy" of Leninism .

[ 229 ] [ 230 ] West German student movement demonstration in West Berlin in 1968, featuring an image of Luxemburg After the death of Stalin , there was a renewed interest in Luxemburg's work. In Poland and East Germany , she was partially rehabilitated and celebrated as a national revolutionary figure, though her more critical ideas were often downplayed.

[ 231 ] For many socialists and communists outside the orthodox Leninist tradition, including Left Communists , Trotskyists, and democratic socialists , she remains a major theoretical and moral touchstone. Her emphasis on democracy and mass action, her critique of bureaucracy and authoritarianism, and her profound humanism continue to inspire revolutionary movements and thinkers around the world.

[ 232 ] She has been reclaimed by modern scholars and activists for her relevance to feminist , anti-racist , and postcolonial critiques of capitalism.

[ 233 ] Commemoration [ edit ] 2016 Liebknecht-Luxemburg Demonstration in Berlin, held each January in their honor In her native Poland, Luxemburg's legacy is controversial, primarily due to her opposition to Polish independence.

[ 234 ] During the Polish People's Republic , several places and enterprises were named after her, including a manufacturing facility of electric lamps in the Wola district of Warsaw, the Zakłady Wytwórcze Lamp Elektrycznych im. Róży Luksemburg [ pl ] .

[ 235 ] A street in Szprotawa used to be named after Luxemburg ( ulica Róży Luksemburg ) until it was changed to ulica Różana (Rose street) in September 2018.

[ 236 ] Many other streets and locations in Poland either used to be or still are named after her, such as those in Warsaw, Gliwice , Będzin , Szprotawa, Lublin , Polkowice , Łódź , etc.

[ 237 ] [ 238 ] [ 239 ] [ 240 ] [ 241 ] Efforts to put up commemorative plaques in her memory have taken place in a number of Polish cities, such as Poznań and her birthplace Zamość. A 45-minute-long sightseeing tour around areas associated with the life of the Polish revolutionary was organised in Warsaw in 2019, where a statue of her by Alfred Jesion was also put on display at the Warsaw Citadel as part of the Gallery of Polish Sculpture of the 1950s.

[ 238 ] The commemorative plaque in Poznań, on the building where she lived in during May 1903, was vandalised with paint in 2013.

[ 242 ] An official petition was started in 2021 to name a square in Wrocław after her, but the local government rejected the proposal.

[ 243 ] In Germany, Luxemburg and Liebknecht are honoured annually on the second weekend of January with the Liebknecht-Luxemburg-Demonstration in Berlin, which ends at the Gedenkstätte der Sozialisten (Socialists' Memorial) in the Friedrichsfelde Central Cemetery . During the German Democratic Republic , the demonstration was a state-sponsored event for the ruling Socialist Unity Party of Germany . The 1988 demonstration was famously used by dissidents to protest the regime by unfurling a banner with Luxemburg's slogan, "Freiheit ist immer Freiheit der Andersdenkenden" ("Freedom is always the freedom of dissenters").

[ 244 ] The German Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution notes that the idolisation of Luxemburg and Liebknecht remains an important tradition for the German far-left.

[ 245 ] Memorial at the site where Luxemburg's corpse was thrown into the Landwehr Canal Numerous places in Germany bear her name, notably Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz and its U-Bahn station in Berlin. After German reunification , there were proposals to rename streets and squares in the former East Berlin honouring communist figures, but a commission recommended that Luxemburg's name, among others, should be retained.

[ 246 ] A memorial to Luxemburg and Liebknecht designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe was built in 1926 but destroyed by the Nazis in 1935. At the edge of the Tiergarten , a memorial marks the spot on the Landwehr Canal where her body was thrown into the water.

In arts and literature [ edit ] Portrait on Rosa-Luxemburg-Straße in Frankfurt Luxemburg's life and death have inspired numerous works of art and literature.

Bertolt Brecht 's 1919 poem "Epitaph" honours her, and was set to music by Kurt Weill in The Berlin Requiem . In cinema, her story was most famously depicted in Margarethe von Trotta 's 1986 biographical film, Rosa Luxemburg , starring Barbara Sukowa , which won the Best Actress award at the 1986 Cannes Film Festival . The Quebec painter Jean-Paul Riopelle created a monumental thirty-painting fresco in 1992, Tribute to Rosa Luxemburg , which is on permanent display at the Musée national des beaux-arts du Québec .

[ 247 ] She has appeared as a character in several novels, including Alfred Döblin 's Karl and Rosa , Jonathan Rabb 's Rosa (2005), and William T. Vollmann 's historical fiction Europe Central (2005). The graphic novel Red Rosa (2015) by Kate Evans provides a biographical account of her life. The feminist magazine Lux , launched in 2020, is named in her honour, describing her as "one of the most creative minds to remake the socialist tradition".

[ 248 ] From 1913 until her death, Luxemburg pursued a lifelong interest in botany by collecting and studying plant specimens.

[ 249 ] Her personal herbarium , comprising 18 notebooks with 377 specimens, is held at the Archive of Modern Records in Warsaw.

[ 249 ] She collected many of the plants during her imprisonments, finding in the work a therapeutic escape and a connection to the outside world.

[ 250 ] The collection, which features plants from Berlin, Wronki , Wrocław, and the Alps , contains handwritten notes on the species, location, and date of collection.

[ 249 ] Body identification controversy [ edit ] Grave of Luxemburg in Berlin On 29 May 2009, German news media reported the discovery of a preserved, unidentified female corpse in the cellar of the Berlin Charité hospital's medical history museum.

[ 251 ] The forensic pathologist Michael Tsokos hypothesised that it might be the body of Rosa Luxemburg. An autopsy on the remains revealed features consistent with Luxemburg: signs of having been submerged in water, an age of 40–50, and legs of differing lengths. A radiocarbon dating test confirmed the body dated from the same period as her murder.

Discrepancies in the original 1919 autopsy report on the body buried in Friedrichsfelde—which noted no hip damage and failed to find evidence of the blows to her head or a bullet—supported Tsokos's theory. In an attempt to identify the Charité corpse, authorities located a great-niece of Luxemburg, Irene Borde, who donated hair for a DNA comparison.

[ 252 ] In late December 2009, the authorities announced that the DNA test was inconclusive. The identity of the body remains unconfirmed, and it is unknown whether the remains buried in 1919 are truly those of Rosa Luxemburg.
