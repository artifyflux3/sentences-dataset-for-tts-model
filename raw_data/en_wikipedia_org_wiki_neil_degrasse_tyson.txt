He was awarded the [NASA Distinguished Public Service Medal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_Distinguished_Public_Service_Medal "NASA Distinguished Public Service Medal") in the same year. From 2006 to 2011, he hosted the television show _[NOVA ScienceNow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOVA\_ScienceNow "NOVA ScienceNow")_ on [PBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBS "PBS"). Since 2009, Tyson has hosted the weekly podcast _[StarTalk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StarTalk\_(podcast) "StarTalk (podcast)")_. A spin-off, also called _[StarTalk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StarTalk\_(U.S.\_talk\_show) "StarTalk (U.S. talk show)")_, began airing on [National Geographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Geographic_(U.S._TV_channel) "National Geographic (U.S. TV channel)") in 2015. In 2014, he hosted the television series _[Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmos:\_A\_Spacetime\_Odyssey "Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey")_, a successor to [Carl Sagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan "Carl Sagan")'s 1980 series _[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmos:\_A\_Personal\_Voyage "Cosmos: A Personal Voyage")_.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-2) The U.S. [National Academy of Sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Academy_of_Sciences "National Academy of Sciences") awarded Tyson the [Public Welfare Medal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Welfare_Medal "Public Welfare Medal") in 2015 for his "extraordinary role in exciting the public about the wonders of science".[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-3)

Early life and education
------------------------

Tyson was born in [Manhattan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan "Manhattan") as the second of three children, into a [Catholic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church "Catholic Church") family living in [the Bronx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bronx "The Bronx").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-5) His [African-American](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans "African Americans") father, Cyril deGrasse Tyson (1927–2016), was a [sociologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociologist "Sociologist") and human resource commissioner for New York City mayor [John Lindsay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lindsay "John Lindsay"), and the first director of [Harlem Youth Opportunities Unlimited](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlem_Youth_Opportunities_Unlimited "Harlem Youth Opportunities Unlimited").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-cyrilnytobit-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-Whitaker2000-7) His mother, Sunchita Maria Tyson (née Feliciano; 1928–2023), was a [gerontologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerontologist "Gerontologist") for the [U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Health_and_Human_Services "United States Department of Health and Human Services") and is of [Puerto Rican](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Ricans "Puerto Ricans") descent.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-8) Neil has two siblings: Stephen Joseph Tyson and Lynn Antipas Tyson.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-cyrilnytobit-6) Neil's middle name, deGrasse, is from the maiden name of his paternal grandmother, who was born as Altima de Grasse in the [British West Indies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_West_Indies "British West Indies") island of [Nevis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevis "Nevis").[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-9)

Tyson grew up in the [Castle Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_Hill,_Bronx "Castle Hill, Bronx") neighborhood of the [Bronx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bronx "The Bronx") and then in [Riverdale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riverdale,_Bronx "Riverdale, Bronx").[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-ndtking2-10) From kindergarten throughout high school, Tyson attended public schools in the Bronx: PS 36 Unionport, PS 81 Robert J. Christen, the [Riverdale Kingsbridge Academy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riverdale_Kingsbridge_Academy "Riverdale Kingsbridge Academy") (MS 141), and graduated from [The Bronx High School of Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bronx_High_School_of_Science "The Bronx High School of Science") in 1976 where he was captain of the [wrestling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholastic_wrestling "Scholastic wrestling") team and editor-in-chief of the _Physical Science Journal_.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-11)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFarmerShepherd-Wynn2012319-12) His interest in astronomy began at the age of nine after visiting the sky theater of the [Hayden Planetarium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayden_Planetarium "Hayden Planetarium").[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFarmerShepherd-Wynn2012300-13) He recalled that "so strong was that imprint [of the night sky] that I'm certain that I had no choice in the matter, that in fact, the universe called me."[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-14) During high school, Tyson attended astronomy courses offered by the Hayden Planetarium, which he called "the most formative period" of his life. He credited Mark Chartrand III, director of the planetarium at the time, as his "first intellectual role model" and his enthusiastic teaching style mixed with humor inspired Tyson to communicate the universe to others the way he did.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFarmerShepherd-Wynn2012309-15)

When he was 14, he received a scholarship from the [Explorers Club of New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explorers_Club_of_New_York "Explorers Club of New York") to view the [June 1973 total solar eclipse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse_of_June_30,_1973 "Solar eclipse of June 30, 1973") aboard the [SS _Canberra_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Canberra "SS Canberra"). The scientific cruise carried two thousand scientists, engineers, and enthusiasts, including [Neil Armstrong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Armstrong "Neil Armstrong"), [Scott Carpenter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Carpenter "Scott Carpenter"), and [Isaac Asimov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov "Isaac Asimov").[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-16)

Tyson obsessively studied astronomy in his teen years; he eventually even gained some fame in the astronomy community by giving lectures on the subject at the age of 15.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-17) Astronomer [Carl Sagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan "Carl Sagan"), who was a faculty member at [Cornell University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_University "Cornell University"), sought to recruit Tyson to Cornell for [undergraduate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undergraduate_education "Undergraduate education") studies.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-Whitaker2000-7) In his book, _The Sky Is Not the Limit_, Tyson wrote:

> My letter of application had been dripping with an interest in the universe. The admission office, unbeknownst to me, had forwarded my application to Carl Sagan's attention. Within weeks, I received a personal letter...[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-18)

Tyson revisited this moment on his first episode of _[Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmos:\_A\_Spacetime\_Odyssey "Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey")_. Pulling out a 1975 calendar belonging to the famous astronomer, he found the day Sagan invited the 17-year-old to spend a day in [Ithaca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ithaca,_New_York "Ithaca, New York"). Sagan had offered to put him up for the night if his bus back to the Bronx did not come. Tyson said, "I already knew I wanted to become a scientist. But that afternoon, I learned from Carl the kind of _person_ I wanted to become."[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-19)[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-20)

Tyson chose to attend [Harvard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University "Harvard University") where he majored in physics and lived in [Currier House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currier_House_(Harvard_College) "Currier House (Harvard College)"). He was a member of the [rowing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rowing_(sport) "Rowing (sport)") team during his freshman year, but returned to [wrestling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collegiate_wrestling "Collegiate wrestling"), [lettering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letterman_(sports) "Letterman (sports)") (achieving varsity team rank) in his senior year. He was also active in dance (styles including [jazz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz_dance "Jazz dance"), ballet, [Afro-Caribbean](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Afro-Caribbean "wikt:Afro-Caribbean"), and [Latin Ballroom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_dance_style_categories#International_Latin "List of dance style categories")).[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-21)

Tyson hosting the 40th anniversary celebration of [Apollo 11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11 "Apollo 11") at the [National Air and Space Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Air_and_Space_Museum "National Air and Space Museum") in Washington, July 2009

Tyson earned a [Bachelor of Arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artium_Baccalaureus "Artium Baccalaureus") degree in physics at [Harvard College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_College "Harvard College") in 1980 and then began his graduate work at the [University of Texas at Austin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Texas_at_Austin "University of Texas at Austin"),[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-22) from which he received a [Master of Arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Arts "Master of Arts") degree in astronomy in 1983. By his own account, he did not spend as much time in the research lab as he should have. His professors encouraged him to consider alternative careers and the committee for his doctoral dissertation was dissolved, ending his pursuit of a doctorate from the University of Texas.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-23)

Tyson was a lecturer in astronomy at the [University of Maryland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Maryland "University of Maryland") from 1986 to 1987[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-haydenplanetarium1-24) and in 1988, he was accepted into the astronomy graduate program at [Columbia University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University "Columbia University"), where he earned a [Master of Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Philosophy "Master of Philosophy") degree in astrophysics in 1989, and a [PhD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy "Doctor of Philosophy") degree in astrophysics in 1991[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-25) under the supervision of Professor [R. Michael Rich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._Michael_Rich "R. Michael Rich"). Rich obtained funding to support Tyson's doctoral research from [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA "NASA") and the [ARCS Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARCS_Foundation "ARCS Foundation"),[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-26) enabling Tyson to attend international meetings in Italy, Switzerland, Chile, and South Africa[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-haydenplanetarium1-24) and to hire students to help him with data reduction.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-27) In the course of his thesis work, he observed using the 0.91 m telescope at the [Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerro_Tololo_Inter-American_Observatory "Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory") in Chile, where he obtained images for the [Calán/Tololo Supernova Survey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cal%C3%A1n/Tololo_Supernova_Survey "Calán/Tololo Supernova Survey")[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-AJ2233-28)[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-29)[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-30) helping to further their work in establishing [Type Ia supernovae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_Ia_supernova "Type Ia supernova") as [standard candles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_candles "Standard candles").

During his thesis research at Columbia University, Tyson became acquainted with Professor [David Spergel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Spergel "David Spergel") at [Princeton University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University "Princeton University"), who visited Columbia University in the course of collaborating with his thesis advisor on the Galactic bulge[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-31)[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-32)[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-33) typically found in [spiral galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_galaxy "Spiral galaxy").

Career
------

[![Image 6](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/Tyson_%26_students.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Tyson_%26_students.jpg)

Tyson with students at the 2007 [American Astronomical Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Astronomical_Society "American Astronomical Society") conference

Tyson's research has focused on observations in [cosmology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_cosmology "Physical cosmology"), [stellar evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_evolution "Stellar evolution"), [galactic astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_astronomy "Galactic astronomy"), [bulges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulge_(astronomy) "Bulge (astronomy)"), and [stellar formation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_formation "Star formation"). He has held numerous positions at institutions including the [University of Maryland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Maryland "University of Maryland"), [Princeton University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University "Princeton University"), the [American Museum of Natural History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Museum_of_Natural_History "American Museum of Natural History"), and the Hayden Planetarium.

In 1994, Tyson joined the Hayden Planetarium as a staff scientist while he was a research affiliate in Princeton University. He became acting director of the planetarium in June 1995 and was appointed director in 1996.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-34) As director, he oversaw the planetarium's $210 million reconstruction project, which was completed in 2000. Upon being asked for his thoughts on becoming director, Tyson said "when I was a kid... there were scientists and educators on the staff at the Hayden Planetarium... who invested their time and energy in my enlightenment... and I've never forgotten that... to end up back there as its director, I feel this deep sense of duty, that I serve in the same capacity for people who come through the facility today, that others served for me".[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-Point_of_Inquiry-35)

Tyson has written a number of popular books on astrophysics. In 1995, he began to write the "Universe" column for _[Natural History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural\_History\_(magazine) "Natural History (magazine)")_ magazine. In a column Tyson wrote for a special edition of the magazine, called "City of Stars", in 2002, he popularized the term "[Manhattanhenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattanhenge "Manhattanhenge")" to describe the two days annually on which the evening sun aligns with the [street grid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_grid "Street grid") in [Manhattan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan "Manhattan"), making the sunset visible along unobstructed side streets. He had coined the term in 1996, inspired by how the phenomenon recalls the sun's solstice alignment with the [Stonehenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonehenge "Stonehenge") monument in England.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-36) Tyson's column also influenced his work as a professor with [The Great Courses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Courses "The Great Courses").[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-37)

In 2001, U.S. President [George W. Bush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush "George W. Bush") appointed Tyson to serve on the [Commission on the Future of the United States Aerospace Industry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commission_on_the_Future_of_the_United_States_Aerospace_Industry "Commission on the Future of the United States Aerospace Industry") and in 2004 to serve on the [President's Commission on Implementation of United States Space Exploration Policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President%27s_Commission_on_Implementation_of_United_States_Space_Exploration_Policy "President's Commission on Implementation of United States Space Exploration Policy"), the latter better known as the "Moon, Mars, and Beyond" commission. Soon afterward, he was awarded the [NASA Distinguished Public Service Medal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_Distinguished_Public_Service_Medal "NASA Distinguished Public Service Medal"), the highest civilian honor bestowed by NASA.[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-38)

[![Image 7](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/Tyson_%26_Kepler_team.jpg/250px-Tyson_%26_Kepler_team.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Tyson_%26_Kepler_team.jpg)

Tyson in December 2011 at a conference marking 1,000 days after the launch of the spacecraft _[Kepler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler\_(spacecraft) "Kepler (spacecraft)")_

In 2004, Tyson hosted the four-part _Origins_ miniseries of the PBS _[Nova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova\_(American\_TV\_series) "Nova (American TV series)")_ series[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-39) and with Donald Goldsmith, co-authored the companion volume for this series, _Origins: Fourteen Billion Years Of Cosmic Evolution_.[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-40) He again collaborated with Goldsmith as the narrator on the documentary _[400 Years of the Telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/400\_Years\_of\_the\_Telescope "400 Years of the Telescope")_, which premiered on PBS in April 2009.[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-41)

As director of the [Hayden Planetarium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_Center_for_Earth_and_Space "Rose Center for Earth and Space"), Tyson bucked traditional thinking in order to keep [Pluto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluto "Pluto") from being referred to as the ninth planet in exhibits at the center. He has explained that he wanted to look at commonalities between objects, grouping the terrestrial planets together, the gas giants together, and Pluto with like objects, and to get away from simply counting the planets. He has stated on _[The Colbert Report](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Colbert\_Report "The Colbert Report")_, _[The Daily Show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Daily\_Show "The Daily Show")_, and _[BBC Horizon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC\_Horizon "BBC Horizon")_ that the decision has resulted in large amounts of hate mail, much of it from children.[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-42) In 2006, the [International Astronomical Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Astronomical_Union "International Astronomical Union") (IAU) confirmed this assessment by changing Pluto to the [dwarf planet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_planet "Dwarf planet") classification.

Tyson recounted the heated online debate on the [Cambridge Conference Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Conference_Network "Cambridge Conference Network") (CCNet), a "widely read, UK-based Internet chat group", following [Benny Peiser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benny_Peiser "Benny Peiser")'s renewed call for reclassification of Pluto's status.[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-TysonPluto2008-43) Peiser's entry, in which he posted articles from the AP and _The Boston Globe_, spawned from _[The New York Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_New\_York\_Times "The New York Times")_'s article entitled "Pluto's Not a Planet? Only in New York".[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-NYT22jan2001-44)[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-CCNet29jan2001-45)

Tyson has been vice-president, president, and chairman of the board of the [Planetary Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_Society "Planetary Society"). He was also the host of the PBS program _[Nova ScienceNow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova\_ScienceNow "Nova ScienceNow")_ until 2011.[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-46) He attended and was a speaker at the [Beyond Belief: Science, Religion, Reason and Survival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyond_Belief:_Science,_Religion,_Reason_and_Survival "Beyond Belief: Science, Religion, Reason and Survival") symposium in November 2006.[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-47)

In April 2011, Tyson was the keynote speaker at the 93rd International Convention of the [Phi Theta Kappa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phi_Theta_Kappa "Phi Theta Kappa") International Honor Society of the Two-year School. He and [James Randi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Randi "James Randi") delivered a lecture entitled _Skepticism_, which related directly with the convention's theme of _The Democratization of Information: Power, Peril, and Promise_.[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-49)

In 2012, Tyson announced that he would appear in a [YouTube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube "YouTube") series based on his radio show _StarTalk_. A premiere date for the show has not been announced, but it will be distributed on the [Nerdist YouTube Channel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerdist_YouTube_Channel "Nerdist YouTube Channel").[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-50) On February 28, 2014, Tyson was a celebrity guest at the [White House Student Film Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Student_Film_Festival "White House Student Film Festival").[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-51)

In 2014, Tyson helped revive Carl Sagan's _[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmos:\_A\_Personal\_Voyage "Cosmos: A Personal Voyage")_ television series, presenting _[Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmos:\_A\_Spacetime\_Odyssey "Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey")_ on both FOX and the [National Geographic Channel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Geographic_(TV_network) "National Geographic (TV network)"). Thirteen episodes were aired in the first season, and Tyson has said that if a second season were produced, he would pass the role of host to someone else in the science world.[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-52)[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-53) On March 9, 2020, he returned with a follow-up season of _Cosmos_ titled _[Cosmos: Possible Worlds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmos:\_Possible\_Worlds "Cosmos: Possible Worlds")_.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-54)[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-55)

### Spirituality and philosophy

> [A] most important feature is the analysis of the information that comes your way. And that's what I don't see enough of in this world. There's a level of gullibility that leaves people susceptible to being taken advantage of. I see science literacy as kind of a vaccine against charlatans who would try to exploit your ignorance.

Tyson has written and broadcast extensively about his views of science, spirituality, and the spirituality of science, including the essays "The Perimeter of Ignorance"[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-60) and "Holy Wars",[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-HolyWars-61) both appearing in _Natural History_ magazine and the 2006 _Beyond Belief_ workshop. In an interview with comedian [Paul Mecurio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Mecurio "Paul Mecurio"), Tyson offered his definition of spirituality, "For me, when I say spiritual, I'm referring to a feeling you would have that connects you to the universe in a way that it may defy simple vocabulary. We think about the universe as an intellectual playground, which it surely is, but the moment you learn something that touches an emotion rather than just something intellectual, I would call that a spiritual encounter with the universe."[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-62) He has argued that many great historical scientists' belief in [intelligent design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_design "Intelligent design") limited their scientific inquiries, to the detriment of the advance of scientific knowledge.[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-HolyWars-61)[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-63)

When asked during a question session at the [University at Buffalo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_at_Buffalo "University at Buffalo") if he believed in a higher power, Tyson responded: "Every account of a higher power that I've seen described, of all religions that I've seen, include many statements with regard to the benevolence of that power. When I look at the universe and all the ways the universe wants to kill us, I find it hard to reconcile that with statements of beneficence."[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-64)[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-65): 341  In an interview with _[Big Think](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big\_Think "Big Think")_, he said: "So, what people are really after is what is my stance on religion or spirituality or God, and I would say if I find a word that came closest, it would be 'agnostic'... at the end of the day I'd rather not be any category at all."[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-Neil_on_YouTube.com-66) Additionally, in the same interview with _Big Think_, Tyson mentioned that he edited Wikipedia's entry on him to include the fact that he is an agnostic:

> I'm constantly _claimed_ by atheists. I find this intriguing. In fact, on my Wiki page –I didn't create the Wiki page. Others did, and I'm flattered that people cared enough about my life to assemble it–and it said, "Neil deGrasse Tyson is an atheist." I said, "Well, that's not really true." I said, "Neil deGrasse Tyson is an agnostic." I went back a week later. It said, "Neil deGrasse Tyson is an atheist" again–within a week!–and I said, "What's up with that?" and I said, "All right, I have to word it a little differently." So I said, "Okay, Neil deGrasse Tyson, widely claimed by atheists, is actually an agnostic."[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-Neil_on_YouTube.com-66)

During the interview "Called by the Universe: A Conversation with Neil deGrasse Tyson" in 2009, Tyson said: "I can't agree to the claims by atheists that I'm one of that community. I don't have the time, energy, interest of conducting myself that way... I'm not trying to convert people. I don't care."[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-67)

[![Image 9](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson_and_Richard_Dawkins_at_Howard_University_%282%29_-_September_28%2C_2010.jpg/250px-Neil_deGrasse_Tyson_and_Richard_Dawkins_at_Howard_University_%282%29_-_September_28%2C_2010.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Neil_deGrasse_Tyson_and_Richard_Dawkins_at_Howard_University_(2)_-_September_28,_2010.jpg)

Tyson in conversation with [Richard Dawkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dawkins "Richard Dawkins") at [Howard University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_University "Howard University"), 2010

In March 2014, philosopher and secularism proponent [Massimo Pigliucci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massimo_Pigliucci "Massimo Pigliucci") asked Tyson: "What is it you think about God?" Tyson replied: "I remain unconvinced by any claims anyone has ever made about the existence or the power of a divine force operating in the universe." Pigliucci then asked him why he expressed discomfort with the label "atheist" in his _Big Think_ video. Tyson replied by reiterating his dislike for one-word labels, saying: "That's what adjectives are for. What kind of atheist are you? Are you an ardent atheist? Are you a passive atheist? An apathetic atheist? Do you rally, or do you just not even care? So I'd be on the 'I really don't care' side of that, if you had to find adjectives to put in front of the word 'atheist'."

Pigliucci contrasted Tyson with scientist [Richard Dawkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dawkins "Richard Dawkins"): "[Dawkins] really does consider, at this point, himself to be an atheist activist. You very clearly made the point that you are not." Tyson replied: "I completely respect that activity. He's fulfilling a really important role out there."[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-Rationally_Speaking_podcast-68) Tyson has spoken about [philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy "Philosophy") on numerous occasions. In March 2014, during an episode of _[The Nerdist Podcast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Nerdist\_Podcast "The Nerdist Podcast")_, he said that philosophy is "useless" and that a philosophy major "can really mess you up",[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-69) which was met with disapproval.[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-70)[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-71)[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-72)[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-73) Pigliucci, a philosopher, later criticized him for "dismiss[ing] philosophy as a useless enterprise".[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-74)

### Race and social justice

In 2005, at a conference at the [National Academy of Sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Academy_of_Sciences "National Academy of Sciences"), Tyson responded to a question about whether genetic differences might keep women from working as scientists. He said that his goal to become an astrophysicist was "hands down the path of most resistance through the forces... of society... My life experience tells me, when you don't find Blacks in the sciences, when you don't find women in the sciences, I know these forces are real and I had to survive them in order to get where I am today. So before we start talking about genetic differences, you gotta come up with a system where there's equal opportunity. Then we can start having that conversation."[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-75)

In a 2014 interview with _[Grantland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grantland "Grantland")_, Tyson said that he related his experience on that 2005 panel in an effort to make the point that the scientific question about genetic differences can not be answered until the social barriers are dismantled. "I'm saying before you even have that conversation, you have to be really sure that access to opportunity has been level." In the same interview, Tyson said that race is not a part of the point he is trying to make in his career or with his life. According to Tyson, "[T]hat then becomes the point of people's understanding of me, rather than the astrophysics. So it's a failed educational step for that to be the case. If you end up being distracted by that and not [getting] the message." He purposefully no longer speaks publicly about race. "I don't give talks on it. I don't even give Black History Month talks. I decline every single one of them. In fact, since 1993, I've declined every interview that has my being black as a premise of the interview."[[76]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-76)

Tyson has positively advocated for the freedoms of [homosexual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality "Homosexuality") and [transgender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender "Transgender") people and argued about the topic repeatedly against [right-wing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics "Right-wing politics") commentators.[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-77)[[78]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-78)[[79]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-79)[[80]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-80)

### NASA

Tyson, [Bill Nye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Nye "Bill Nye"), and U.S. President [Barack Obama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama "Barack Obama") take a [selfie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfie "Selfie") at the [White House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House "White House"), 2014.

Tyson is an advocate for expanding the operations of the [National Aeronautics and Space Administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA "NASA"). Arguing that "the most powerful agency on the dreams of a nation is currently underfunded to do what it needs to be doing".[[81]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-buffalo2010-81) He has suggested that the general public has a tendency to overestimate how much revenue is allocated to the space agency. At a March 2010 address, referencing the proportion of tax revenue spent on NASA, he stated, "By the way, how much does NASA cost? It's a half a penny on the dollar. Did you know that? The people are saying, 'Why are we spending money up there...' I ask them, 'How much do you think we're spending?' They say 'five cents, ten cents on a dollar.' It's a half a penny."[[81]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-buffalo2010-81)

In March 2012, Tyson testified before the [United States Senate Science Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_Commerce,_Science_and_Transportation "United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation"), stating that:

> Right now, NASA's annual budget is half a penny on your tax dollar. For twice that—a penny on a dollar—we can transform the country from a sullen, dispirited nation, weary of economic struggle, to one where it has reclaimed its 20th century birthright to dream of tomorrow.[[82]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-tysontranscript-82)[[83]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-tysontranscript_video-83)

Inspired by Tyson's advocacy and remarks, [Penny4NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penny4NASA "Penny4NASA"), a campaign of the Space Advocates nonprofit[[84]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-space-advocates-2014-84) was founded in 2012 by John Zeller and advocates doubling NASA's budget to one percent of the federal budget.[[85]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-penny4nasa-whywefight-85)

In his book _[Space Chronicles: Facing the Ultimate Frontier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space\_Chronicles "Space Chronicles")_ Tyson argues that large and ambitious space exploration projects, like getting [humans to Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration_of_Mars "Exploration of Mars"), will probably require some sort of military or economic driver in order to get the appropriate funding from the [United States federal government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States "Federal government of the United States").[[86]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-86)

"I Am America (And So Can You!)")_, noting in his chapter on scientists that most scientists are "decent, well-intentioned people", but presumably [tongue-in-cheek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongue-in-cheek "Tongue-in-cheek"), that "Neil DeGrasse [_[sic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sic "Sic")_] Tyson is an absolute monster."[[87]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson#cite_note-87)
