He was the founding editor of the review journal Statistical Science .

Academic works [ edit ] He wrote six books, edited four volumes and authored over one hundred papers.  Most of his research was on the theory of rational decision-making under uncertainty.  His Optimal Statistical Decisions , published in 1970, is still recognized as one of the great books in the field. His courses on statistical decision theory taught at Carnegie-Mellon influenced Edward C. Prescott and Robert Lucas, Jr.

, [ 4 ] influential figures in the development of new classical macroeconomics and real business-cycle theory . DeGroot's undergraduate text, Probability and Statistics , published in 1975, is widely recognized as a classic textbook.
