It is situated in Maungakiekie-Tāmaki , north-east of the Manukau Harbour and west of the Tāmaki River . The park is owned and operated by Auckland Council .

[ 2 ] Geography [ edit ] Mutukāroa / Hamlins Hill is the largest non-volcanic hill on the Auckland isthmus . It is formed from Waitemata sandstone , surrounded by much younger volcanic deposits.

[ 3 ] The hill is 65 metres high.

[ 4 ] The regional park is predominantly made up of two European farms, Hamlin's Farm and Penrose Farm.

[ 1 ] History [ edit ] Mutukaroa is the site of one of the largest kāinga (undefended settlements) on the Tāmaki isthmus , surrounded by vast kūmara gardens. During the Waiohua period, the hill was a residence for Ngāi Tai , who continued to occupy the hill after Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei settled the isthmus in the 18th century.

[ 5 ] The name Hamlin(s) Hill comes from James Hamlin, a reverend of the Church Missionary Society , who received the land as  part of a Crown land grant in the 1840s.

[ 3 ] For many years, the farmland on the hill was used as holding paddocks for the Westfield Freezing Works .

[ 3 ] The hill was planned for demolition in the 1960s, as a part of a plan to reclaim 30 hectares of land from the Manukau Harbour . The hill was saved after a public outcry and court action.

[ 3 ] Since the early 2000s, native trees have been planted on the hill.

[ 1 ] The hill was officially gazetted as Mutukaroa / Hamlin Hill in 2014.
