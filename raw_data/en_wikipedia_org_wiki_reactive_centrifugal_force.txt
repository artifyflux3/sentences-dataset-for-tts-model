For centrifugal force more generally, including other concepts of it and its history, see [Centrifugal force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrifugal_force "Centrifugal force").

In [classical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics "Classical mechanics"), a **reactive centrifugal force** forms part of an actionâ€“reaction pair with a [centripetal force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centripetal_force "Centripetal force").

In accordance with [Newton's first law of motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion#Newton's_first_law "Newton's laws of motion"), an object moves in a straight line in the absence of a [net force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_force "Net force") acting on the object. A curved path ensues when a force that is orthogonal to the object's motion acts on it; this force is often called a [centripetal force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centripetal_force "Centripetal force"), as it is directed toward the center of curvature of the path. Then in accordance with [Newton's third law of motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion#Newton's_third_law "Newton's laws of motion"), there will also be an equal and opposite force exerted by the object on some other object,[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_centrifugal_force#cite_note-Roche-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_centrifugal_force#cite_note-Kobayashi-2) and this reaction force is sometimes called a _reactive centrifugal force_, as it is directed in the opposite direction of the centripetal force.

In the case of a ball held in [circular motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_motion "Circular motion") by a string, the centripetal force is the force exerted by the string on the ball. The reactive centrifugal force on the other hand is the force the ball exerts on the string, placing it under [tension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tension_(physics) "Tension (physics)").

Unlike the [inertial force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_force "Inertial force") known as [_centrifugal force_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrifugal_force_(rotating_reference_frame) "Centrifugal force (rotating reference frame)"), which exists only in the [rotating frame of reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotating_reference_frame "Rotating reference frame"), the reactive force is a real Newtonian [force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force "Force") that is observed in any reference frame. The two forces will only have the same magnitude in the special cases where circular motion arises and where the axis of rotation is the origin of the rotating frame of reference.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_centrifugal_force#cite_note-mook-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_centrifugal_force#cite_note-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_centrifugal_force#cite_note-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_centrifugal_force#cite_note-scott-6)

[![Image 1](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Reactive_centrifugal_force_in_uniform_circular_motion.PNG/250px-Reactive_centrifugal_force_in_uniform_circular_motion.PNG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Reactive_centrifugal_force_in_uniform_circular_motion.PNG)

A ball in circular motion held by a string tied to a fixed post.

The figure at right shows a ball in [uniform circular motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_circular_motion "Uniform circular motion") held to its path by a string tied to an immovable post. In this system a [centripetal force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centripetal_force "Centripetal force") upon the ball provided by the string maintains the circular motion, and the reaction to it, which some refer to as the _reactive centrifugal force_, acts upon the string and the post.

[Newton's first law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_first_law "Newton's first law") requires that any body moving along any path other than a straight line be subject to a net non-zero force, and the [free body diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_body_diagram "Free body diagram") shows the force upon the ball (center panel) exerted by the string to maintain the ball in its circular motion.

[Newton's third law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion#Newton's_third_law "Newton's laws of motion") of action and reaction states that if the string exerts an inward centripetal force on the ball, the ball will exert an equal but outward reaction upon the string, shown in the free body diagram of the string (lower panel) as the _reactive centrifugal force_.

The string transmits the reactive centrifugal force from the ball to the fixed post, pulling upon the post. Again according to Newton's third law, the post exerts a reaction upon the string, labeled the _post reaction_, pulling upon the string. The two forces upon the string are equal and opposite, exerting no _net_ force upon the string (assuming that the string is massless), but placing the string under tension.

The reason the post appears to be "immovable" is because it is fixed to the earth. If the rotating ball was tethered to the mast of a boat, for example, the boat mast and ball would both experience rotation about a central point.

Even though the reactive centrifugal is rarely used in analyses in the physics literature, the concept is applied within some mechanical engineering concepts. An example of this kind of engineering concept is an analysis of the stresses within a rapidly rotating turbine blade.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_centrifugal_force#cite_note-Roche-1) The blade can be treated as a stack of layers going from the axis out to the edge of the blade. Each layer exerts an outward (centrifugal) force on the immediately adjacent, radially inward layer and an inward (centripetal) force on the immediately adjacent, radially outward layer. At the same time the inner layer exerts an elastic centripetal force on the middle layer, while and the outer layer exerts an elastic centrifugal force, which results in an internal stress. It is the stresses in the blade and their causes that mainly interest mechanical engineers in this situation.

A two-shoe **[centrifugal clutch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrifugal_clutch "Centrifugal clutch")**. The motor spins the input shaft that makes the shoes go around, and the outer drum (removed) turns the output power shaft.

Another example of a rotating device in which a reactive centrifugal force can be identified used to describe the system behavior is the [centrifugal clutch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrifugal_clutch "Centrifugal clutch"). A centrifugal clutch is used in small engine-powered devices such as chain saws, go-karts and model helicopters. It allows the engine to start and idle without driving the device, but automatically and smoothly engages the drive as the engine speed rises. A spring is used to constrain the spinning clutch shoes. At low speeds, the spring provides the centripetal force to the shoes, which move to larger radius as the speed increases and the spring stretches under tension. At higher speeds, when the shoes can't move any further out to increase the spring tension, due to the outer drum, the drum provides some of the centripetal force that keeps the shoes moving in a circular path. The force of tension applied to the spring, and the outward force applied to the drum by the spinning shoes are the corresponding reactive centrifugal forces. The mutual force between the drum and the shoes provides the friction needed to engage the output drive shaft that is connected to the drum.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_centrifugal_force#cite_note-7) Thus the [centrifugal clutch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrifugal_clutch "Centrifugal clutch") illustrates both the fictitious centrifugal force and the reactive centrifugal force.

Difference from centrifugal pseudoforce
---------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reactive_centrifugal_force&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Difference from centrifugal pseudoforce")]

The "reactive centrifugal force" discussed in this article is not the same thing as the [centrifugal pseudoforce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrifugal_force "Centrifugal force"), which is usually what is meant by the term "centrifugal force".

Reactive centrifugal force, being one-half of the reaction pair together with centripetal force, is a concept which applies in any reference frame. This distinguishes it from the inertial or fictitious centrifugal force, which appears only in rotating frames.

|  | Reactive centrifugal force | Inertial centrifugal force |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Reference frame | Any | Only rotating frames |
| Exerted _by_ | Bodies undergoing rotation | Acts as if emanating from the rotation axis, it is a so-called [fictitious force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictitious_force "Fictitious force") |
| Exerted _upon_ | The constraint that causes the inward centripetal force | All bodies, moving or not; if moving, [Coriolis force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coriolis_force "Coriolis force") is present as well |
| Direction | Opposite to the centripetal force | Away from rotation axis, regardless of path of body |
| [Kinetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetics_(physics) "Kinetics (physics)") analysis | Part of an action-reaction pair with a centripetal force as per Newton's third law | Included as a [fictitious force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictitious_force "Fictitious force") in Newton's second law and is never part of an action-reaction pair with a centripetal force |

Gravitational two-body case
---------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reactive_centrifugal_force&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Gravitational two-body case")]

In a two-body rotation, such as a planet and moon rotating about their common center of mass or [barycentre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barycentre "Barycentre"), the forces on both bodies are centripetal. In that case, the reaction to the centripetal force of the planet on the moon is the centripetal force of the moon on the planet.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_centrifugal_force#cite_note-scott-6)
