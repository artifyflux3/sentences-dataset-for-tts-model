Find sources: "T-square" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( November 2023 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Drafting board with a T-square and set square A T-square is a technical drawing instrument used by draftsmen primarily as a guide for drawing horizontal lines on a drafting table . The instrument is named after its resemblance to the letter T, with a long shaft called the "blade" and a short shaft called the "stock" or "head". T-squares are available in a range of sizes, with common lengths being 18 inches (460 mm), 24 inches (610 mm), 30 inches (760 mm), 36 inches (910 mm) and 42 inches (1,100 mm).

[ citation needed ] In addition to drawing horizontal lines, a T-square can be used with a set square to draw vertical or diagonal lines.

[ 1 ] The T-square usually has a transparent edge made of plastic which should be free of nicks and cracks in order to provide smooth, straight lines.

T-squares are also used in various industries, such as construction. For example, drywall T-squares are typically made of aluminum and have a 48-inch-long (120 cm) tongue, allowing them to be used for measuring and cutting drywall. In woodworking, higher-end table saws often have T-square fences attached to a rail on the front side of the table, providing improved accuracy and precision when cutting wood.
