Thus it is a topological space in which each point has a neighbourhood homeomorphic to an open set in a Banach space (a more involved and formal definition is given below). Banach manifolds are one possibility of extending manifolds to infinite dimensions .

A further generalisation is to Fréchet manifolds , replacing Banach spaces by Fréchet spaces . On the other hand, a Hilbert manifold is a special case of a Banach manifold in which the manifold is locally modeled on Hilbert spaces .

Definition [ edit ] Let X {\displaystyle X} be a set . An atlas of class C r , {\displaystyle C^{r},} r ≥ ≥ 0 , {\displaystyle r\geq 0,} on X {\displaystyle X} is a collection of pairs (called charts ) ( U i , φ φ i ) , {\displaystyle \left(U_{i},\varphi _{i}\right),} i ∈ ∈ I , {\displaystyle i\in I,} such that each U i {\displaystyle U_{i}} is a subset of X {\displaystyle X} and the union of the U i {\displaystyle U_{i}} is the whole of X {\displaystyle X} ; each φ φ i {\displaystyle \varphi _{i}} is a bijection from U i {\displaystyle U_{i}} onto an open subset φ φ i ( U i ) {\displaystyle \varphi _{i}\left(U_{i}\right)} of some Banach space E i , {\displaystyle E_{i},} and for any indices i and j , {\displaystyle i{\text{ and }}j,} φ φ i ( U i ∩ ∩ U j ) {\displaystyle \varphi _{i}\left(U_{i}\cap U_{j}\right)} is open in E i ; {\displaystyle E_{i};} the crossover map φ φ j ∘ ∘ φ φ i − − 1 : φ φ i ( U i ∩ ∩ U j ) → → φ φ j ( U i ∩ ∩ U j ) {\displaystyle \varphi _{j}\circ \varphi _{i}^{-1}:\varphi _{i}\left(U_{i}\cap U_{j}\right)\to \varphi _{j}\left(U_{i}\cap U_{j}\right)} is an r {\displaystyle r} -times continuously differentiable function for every i , j ∈ ∈ I ; {\displaystyle i,j\in I;} that is, the r {\displaystyle r} th Fréchet derivative d r ( φ φ j ∘ ∘ φ φ i − − 1 ) : φ φ i ( U i ∩ ∩ U j ) → → L i n ( E i r ; E j ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {d} ^{r}\left(\varphi _{j}\circ \varphi _{i}^{-1}\right):\varphi _{i}\left(U_{i}\cap U_{j}\right)\to \mathrm {Lin} \left(E_{i}^{r};E_{j}\right)} exists and is a continuous function with respect to the E i {\displaystyle E_{i}} - norm topology on subsets of E i {\displaystyle E_{i}} and the operator norm topology on Lin ⁡ ⁡ ( E i r ; E j ) .

{\displaystyle \operatorname {Lin} \left(E_{i}^{r};E_{j}\right).} One can then show that there is a unique topology on X {\displaystyle X} such that each U i {\displaystyle U_{i}} is open and each φ φ i {\displaystyle \varphi _{i}} is a homeomorphism . Very often, this topological space is assumed to be a Hausdorff space , but this is not necessary from the point of view of the formal definition.

If all the Banach spaces E i {\displaystyle E_{i}} are equal to the same space E , {\displaystyle E,} the atlas is called an E {\displaystyle E} -atlas . However, it is not a priori necessary that the Banach spaces E i {\displaystyle E_{i}} be the same space, or even isomorphic as topological vector spaces . However, if two charts ( U i , φ φ i ) {\displaystyle \left(U_{i},\varphi _{i}\right)} and ( U j , φ φ j ) {\displaystyle \left(U_{j},\varphi _{j}\right)} are such that U i {\displaystyle U_{i}} and U j {\displaystyle U_{j}} have a non-empty intersection , a quick examination of the derivative of the crossover map φ φ j ∘ ∘ φ φ i − − 1 : φ φ i ( U i ∩ ∩ U j ) → → φ φ j ( U i ∩ ∩ U j ) {\displaystyle \varphi _{j}\circ \varphi _{i}^{-1}:\varphi _{i}\left(U_{i}\cap U_{j}\right)\to \varphi _{j}\left(U_{i}\cap U_{j}\right)} shows that E i {\displaystyle E_{i}} and E j {\displaystyle E_{j}} must indeed be isomorphic as topological vector spaces. Furthermore, the set of points x ∈ ∈ X {\displaystyle x\in X} for which there is a chart ( U i , φ φ i ) {\displaystyle \left(U_{i},\varphi _{i}\right)} with x {\displaystyle x} in U i {\displaystyle U_{i}} and E i {\displaystyle E_{i}} isomorphic to a given Banach space E {\displaystyle E} is both open and closed . Hence, one can without loss of generality assume that, on each connected component of X , {\displaystyle X,} the atlas is an E {\displaystyle E} -atlas for some fixed E .

{\displaystyle E.} A new chart ( U , φ φ ) {\displaystyle (U,\varphi )} is called compatible with a given atlas { ( U i , φ φ i ) : i ∈ ∈ I } {\displaystyle \left\{\left(U_{i},\varphi _{i}\right):i\in I\right\}} if the crossover map φ φ i ∘ ∘ φ φ − − 1 : φ φ ( U ∩ ∩ U i ) → → φ φ i ( U ∩ ∩ U i ) {\displaystyle \varphi _{i}\circ \varphi ^{-1}:\varphi \left(U\cap U_{i}\right)\to \varphi _{i}\left(U\cap U_{i}\right)} is an r {\displaystyle r} -times continuously differentiable function for every i ∈ ∈ I .

{\displaystyle i\in I.} Two atlases are called compatible if every chart in one is compatible with the other atlas. Compatibility defines an equivalence relation on the class of all possible atlases on X .

{\displaystyle X.} A C r {\displaystyle C^{r}} -manifold structure on X {\displaystyle X} is then defined to be a choice of equivalence class of atlases on X {\displaystyle X} of class C r .

{\displaystyle C^{r}.} If all the Banach spaces E i {\displaystyle E_{i}} are isomorphic as topological vector spaces (which is guaranteed to be the case if X {\displaystyle X} is connected ), then an equivalent atlas can be found for which they are all equal to some Banach space E .

{\displaystyle E.} X {\displaystyle X} is then called an E {\displaystyle E} -manifold , or one says that X {\displaystyle X} is modeled on E .

{\displaystyle E.} Examples [ edit ] Every Banach space can be canonically identified as a Banach manifold. If ( X , ‖ ‖ ⋅ ⋅ ‖ ‖ ) {\displaystyle (X,\|\,\cdot \,\|)} is a Banach space, then X {\displaystyle X} is a Banach manifold with an atlas containing a single, globally defined chart (the identity map ).

Similarly, if U {\displaystyle U} is an open subset of some Banach space then U {\displaystyle U} is a Banach manifold.  (See the classification theorem below.) Classification up to homeomorphism [ edit ] It is by no means true that a finite-dimensional manifold of dimension n {\displaystyle n} is globally homeomorphic to R n , {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n},} or even an open subset of R n .

{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}.} However, in an infinite-dimensional setting, it is possible to classify " well-behaved " Banach manifolds up to homeomorphism quite nicely. A 1969 theorem of David Henderson [ 1 ] states that every infinite-dimensional, separable , metric Banach manifold X {\displaystyle X} can be embedded as an open subset of the infinite-dimensional, separable Hilbert space, H {\displaystyle H} (up to linear isomorphism, there is only one such space, usually identified with ℓ ℓ 2 {\displaystyle \ell ^{2}} ). In fact, Henderson's result is stronger: the same conclusion holds for any metric manifold modeled on a separable infinite-dimensional Fréchet space .

The embedding homeomorphism can be used as a global chart for X .

{\displaystyle X.} Thus, in the infinite-dimensional, separable, metric case, the "only" Banach manifolds are the open subsets of Hilbert space.
