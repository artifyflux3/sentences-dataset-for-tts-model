In [graphical perspective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(graphical) "Perspective (graphical)"), parallel (horizontal) lines in the plane intersect at a [vanishing point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanishing_point "Vanishing point") (on the [horizon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon "Horizon")).

In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), the concept of a **projective space** originated from the visual effect of [perspective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(graphical) "Perspective (graphical)"), where parallel lines seem to meet _at infinity_. A projective space may thus be viewed as the extension of a [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space"), or, more generally, an [affine space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_space "Affine space") with [points at infinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_at_infinity "Points at infinity"), in such a way that there is one point at infinity of each [direction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_space#direction "Affine space") of [parallel lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_lines "Parallel lines").

This definition of a projective space has the disadvantage of not being [isotropic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotropic "Isotropic"), having two different sorts of points, which must be considered separately in proofs. Therefore, other definitions are generally preferred. There are two classes of definitions. In [synthetic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_geometry "Synthetic geometry"), _point_ and _line_ are primitive entities that are related by the incidence relation "a point is on a line" or "a line passes through a point", which is subject to the [axioms of projective geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axioms_of_projective_geometry "Axioms of projective geometry"). For some such set of axioms, the projective spaces that are defined have been shown to be equivalent to those resulting from the following definition, which is more often encountered in modern textbooks.

Using [linear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra "Linear algebra"), a projective space of dimension n is defined as the set of the [vector lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_line "Vector line") (that is, vector subspaces of dimension one) in a [vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space")V of dimension _n_ + 1. Equivalently, it is the [quotient set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotient_set "Quotient set") of _V_ \ {0} by the [equivalence relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_relation "Equivalence relation") "being on the same vector line". As a vector line intersects the [unit sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_sphere "Unit sphere") of V in two [antipodal points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipodal_points "Antipodal points"), projective spaces can be equivalently defined as spheres in which antipodal points are identified. A projective space of dimension 1 is a [projective line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_line "Projective line"), and a projective space of dimension 2 is a [projective plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_plane "Projective plane").

Projective spaces are widely used in [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry"), allowing for simpler statements and simpler proofs. For example, in [affine geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_geometry "Affine geometry"), two distinct lines in a plane intersect in at most one point, while, in [projective geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_geometry "Projective geometry"), they intersect in exactly one point. Also, there is only one class of [conic sections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conic_section "Conic section"), which can be distinguished only by their intersections with the line at infinity: two intersection points for [hyperbolas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbola "Hyperbola"); one for the [parabola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabola "Parabola"), which is tangent to the line at infinity; and no real intersection point of [ellipses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipse "Ellipse").

In [topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology "Topology"), and more specifically in [manifold theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold_theory "Manifold theory"), projective spaces play a fundamental role, being typical examples of [non-orientable manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-orientable_manifold "Non-orientable manifold").

[![Image 2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/Affine_space_R3.png/250px-Affine_space_R3.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Affine_space_R3.png)

Projective plane and [central projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_projection "Central projection")

As outlined above, projective spaces were introduced for formalizing statements like "two [coplanar lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coplanar_lines "Coplanar lines") intersect in exactly one point, and this point is at infinity if the lines are [parallel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_lines "Parallel lines")". Such statements are suggested by the study of [perspective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(graphical) "Perspective (graphical)"), which may be considered as a [central projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_projection "Central projection") of the [three dimensional space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_dimensional_space "Three dimensional space") onto a [plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(geometry) "Plane (geometry)") (see _[Pinhole camera model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinhole\_camera\_model "Pinhole camera model")_). More precisely, the entrance pupil of a camera or of the eye of an observer is the _center of projection_, and the image is formed on the _projection plane_.

Mathematically, the center of projection is a point O of the space (the intersection of the axes in the figure); the projection plane (_P_ 2, in blue on the figure) is a plane not passing through O, which is often chosen to be the plane of equation _z_ = 1, when [Cartesian coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinates "Cartesian coordinates") are considered. Then, the central projection maps a point P to the intersection of the line OP with the projection plane. Such an intersection exists if and only if the point P does not belong to the plane (_P_ 1, in green on the figure) that passes through O and is parallel to _P_ 2.

It follows that the lines passing through O split in two disjoint subsets: the lines that are not contained in _P_ 1, which are in one to one correspondence with the points of _P_ 2, and those contained in _P_ 1, which are in one to one correspondence with the directions of parallel lines in _P_ 2. This suggests to define the _points_ (called here _projective points_ for clarity) of the projective plane as the lines passing through O. A _projective line_ in this plane consists of all projective points (which are lines) contained in a plane passing through O. As the intersection of two planes passing through O is a line passing through O, the intersection of two distinct projective lines consists of a single projective point. The plane _P_ 1 defines a projective line which is called the _line at infinity_ of _P_ 2. By identifying each point of _P_ 2 with the corresponding projective point, one can thus say that the projective plane is the [disjoint union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint_union "Disjoint union") of _P_ 2 and the (projective) line at infinity.

As an [affine space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_space "Affine space") with a distinguished point O may be identified with its associated [vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space") (see _[Affine space §Vector spaces as affine spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine\_space#Vector\_spaces\_as\_affine\_spaces "Affine space")_), the preceding construction is generally done by starting from a vector space and is called [projectivization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projectivization "Projectivization"). Also, the construction can be done by starting with a vector space of any positive dimension.

So, a projective space of dimension n can be defined as the set of [vector lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_line "Vector line") (vector subspaces of dimension one) in a vector space of dimension _n_ + 1. A projective space can also be defined as the elements of any set that is in natural correspondence with this set of vector lines.

This set can be the set of [equivalence classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_class "Equivalence class") under the equivalence relation between vectors defined by "one vector is the product of the other by a nonzero scalar". In other words, this amounts to defining a projective space as the set of vector lines in which the zero vector has been removed.

A third equivalent definition is to define a projective space of dimension n as the set of pairs of [antipodal points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipodal_points "Antipodal points") in a sphere of dimension n (in a space of dimension _n_ + 1).

Given a [vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space")V over a [field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics) "Field (mathematics)")K, the _projective space_**P**(_V_) is the set of [equivalence classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_class "Equivalence class") of _V_ \ {0} under the equivalence relation ~ defined by _x_ ~ _y_ if there is a nonzero element λ of K such that _x_ = _λy_. If V is a [topological vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_vector_space "Topological vector space"), the quotient space **P**(_V_) is a [topological space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space "Topological space"), endowed with the [quotient topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotient_topology "Quotient topology") of the [subspace topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspace_topology "Subspace topology") of _V_ \ {0}. This is the case when K is the field **R** of the [real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number") or the field **C** of the [complex numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number "Complex number"). If V is finite dimensional, the _dimension_ of **P**(_V_) is the dimension of V minus one.

In the common case where _V_ = _K_ _n_+1, the projective space **P**(_V_) is denoted **P**_n_(_K_) (as well as _K_**P**_n_ or **P**_n_(_K_), although this notation may be confused with exponentiation). The space **P**_n_(_K_) is often called _the_ projective space of dimension n over K, or _the projective n-space_, since all projective spaces of dimension n are [isomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphism "Isomorphism") to it (because every K vector space of dimension _n_ + 1 is isomorphic to _K_ _n_+1).

The elements of a projective space **P**(_V_) are commonly called _[points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point\_(geometry) "Point (geometry)")_. If a [basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_(vector_space) "Basis (vector space)") of V has been chosen, and, in particular if _V_ = _K_ _n_+1, the [projective coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_coordinates "Projective coordinates") of a point _P_ are the coordinates on the basis of any element of the corresponding equivalence class. These coordinates are commonly denoted [_x_ 0: ...: _x_ _n_], the colons and the brackets being used for distinguishing from usual coordinates, and emphasizing that this is an equivalence class, which is defined [up to](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_to "Up to") the multiplication by a non zero constant. That is, if [_x_ 0: ...: _x_ _n_] are projective coordinates of a point, then [_λx_ 0: ...: _λx_ _n_] are also projective coordinates of the same point, for any nonzero λ in K. Also, the above definition implies that [_x_ 0: ...: _x_ _n_] are projective coordinates of a point if and only if at least one of the coordinates is nonzero.

If K is the field of real or complex numbers, a projective space is called a [real projective space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_projective_space "Real projective space") or a [complex projective space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_projective_space "Complex projective space"), respectively. If _n_ is one or two, a projective space of dimension _n_ is called a [projective line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_line "Projective line") or a [projective plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_plane "Projective plane"), respectively. The complex projective line is also called the [Riemann sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_sphere "Riemann sphere").

All these definitions extend naturally to the case where K is a [division ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_ring "Division ring"); see, for example, _[Quaternionic projective space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternionic\_projective\_space "Quaternionic projective space")_. The notation PG(_n_, _K_) is sometimes used for **P**_n_(_K_).[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_space#cite_note-1) If K is a [finite field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_field "Finite field") with q elements, **P**_n_(_K_) is often denoted PG(_n_, _q_) (see _[PG(3,2)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PG(3,2) "PG(3,2)")_).[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_space#cite_note-2)

Let **P**(_V_) be a projective space, where V is a vector space over a field K, and ![Image 3: {\displaystyle p:V\to \mathbf {P} (V)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/20cd3642693e83a05a59356388ae53f1a107345e) be the _canonical map_ that maps a nonzero vector v to its equivalence class, which is the [vector line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_line "Vector line") containing v with the zero vector removed.

Every [linear subspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_subspace "Linear subspace")W of V is a union of lines. It follows that _p_(_W_) is a projective space, which can be identified with **P**(_W_).

A _projective subspace_ is thus a projective space that is obtained by restricting to a linear subspace the equivalence relation that defines **P**(_V_).

If _p_(_v_) and _p_(_w_) are two different points of **P**(_V_), the vectors v and w are [linearly independent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linearly_independent "Linearly independent"). It follows that:

*   There is exactly one projective line that passes through two different points of **P**(_V_), and
*   A subset of **P**(_V_) is a projective subspace if and only if, given any two different points, it contains the whole projective line passing through these points.

In [synthetic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_geometry "Synthetic geometry"), where projective lines are primitive objects, the first property is an axiom, and the second one is the definition of a projective subspace.

Every [intersection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_intersection "Set intersection") of projective subspaces is a projective subspace. It follows that for every subset S of a projective space, there is a smallest projective subspace containing S, the intersection of all projective subspaces containing S. This projective subspace is called the _projective span_ of S, and S is a spanning set for it.

A set S of points is _projectively independent_ if its span is not the span of any proper subset of S. If S is a spanning set of a projective space P, then there is a subset of S that spans P and is projectively independent (this results from the similar theorem for vector spaces). If the dimension of P is n, such an independent spanning set has _n_ + 1 elements.

Contrarily to the cases of [vector spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space") and [affine spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_space "Affine space"), an independent spanning set does not suffice for defining coordinates. One needs one more point, see next section.

A _projective frame_ or _projective basis_ is an ordered set of points in a projective space that allows defining coordinates.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBerger2009chapter_4.4._Projective_bases-3) More precisely, in an n-dimensional projective space, a projective frame is a tuple of _n_ + 2 points such that any _n_ + 1 of them are independent; that is, they are not contained in a [hyperplane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplane "Hyperplane").

If V is an (_n_ + 1)-dimensional vector space, and p is the canonical projection from V to **P**(_V_), then (_p_(_e_ 0), ..., _p_(_e_ _n_+1)) is a projective frame if and only if (_e_ 0, ..., _e_ _n_) is a basis of V and the coefficients of _e_ _n_+1 on this basis are all nonzero. By rescaling the first n vectors, any frame can be rewritten as (_p_(_e_′0), ..., p(_e_′_n_+1)) such that _e_′_n_+1 = _e_′0 + ... + _e_′_n_; this representation is unique up to the multiplication of all _e_′_i_ with a common nonzero factor.

The _projective coordinates_ or _homogeneous coordinates_ of a point _p_(_v_) on a frame (_p_(_e_ 0), ..., _p_(_e_ _n_+1)) with _e_ _n_+1 = _e_ 0 + ... + _e_ _n_ are the coordinates of v on the basis (_e_ 0, ..., _e_ _n_). They are only defined up to scaling with a common nonzero factor.

The _canonical frame_ of the projective space **P**_n_(_K_) consists of images by p of the elements of the canonical basis of _K_ _n_+1 (that is, the [tuples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuples "Tuples") with only one nonzero entry, equal to 1), and the image by p of their sum.

### Projective geometry

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Projective_space&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Projective geometry")]

In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), [projective geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_geometry "Projective geometry") is the study of geometric properties that are invariant with respect to [projective transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_transformation "Projective transformation"). This means that, compared to elementary [Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry "Euclidean geometry"), projective geometry has a different setting (_projective space_) and a selective set of basic geometric concepts. The basic intuitions are that projective space has more points than [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space"), for a given dimension, and that [geometric transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_transformation "Geometric transformation") are permitted that transform the extra points (called "[points at infinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_at_infinity "Point at infinity")") to Euclidean points, and vice versa.

Properties meaningful for projective geometry are respected by this new idea of transformation, which is more radical in its effects than can be expressed by a [transformation matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_matrix "Transformation matrix") and [translations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(geometry) "Translation (geometry)") (the [affine transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_transformation "Affine transformation")). The first issue for geometers is what kind of geometry is adequate for a novel situation. Unlike in [Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry "Euclidean geometry"), the concept of an [angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle "Angle") does not apply in projective geometry, because no measure of angles is invariant with respect to projective transformations, as is seen in [perspective drawing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_drawing "Perspective drawing") from a changing perspective. One source for projective geometry was indeed the theory of perspective. Another difference from elementary geometry is the way in which [parallel lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_(geometry) "Parallel (geometry)") can be said to meet in a [point at infinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_at_infinity "Point at infinity"), once the concept is translated into projective geometry's terms. Again this notion has an intuitive basis, such as railway tracks meeting at the horizon in a perspective drawing. See _[Projective plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective\_plane "Projective plane")_ for the basics of projective geometry in two dimensions.

While the ideas were available earlier, projective geometry was mainly a development of the 19th century. This included the theory of [complex projective space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_projective_space "Complex projective space"), the coordinates used ([homogeneous coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_coordinates "Homogeneous coordinates")) being complex numbers. Several major types of more abstract mathematics (including [invariant theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariant_theory "Invariant theory"), the [Italian school of algebraic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_school_of_algebraic_geometry "Italian school of algebraic geometry"), and [Felix Klein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Klein "Felix Klein")'s [Erlangen programme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlangen_programme "Erlangen programme") resulting in the study of the [classical groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_groups "Classical groups")) were motivated by projective geometry. It was also a subject with many practitioners for its own sake, as [synthetic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_geometry "Synthetic geometry"). Another topic that developed from axiomatic studies of projective geometry is [finite geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_geometry "Finite geometry").

The topic of projective geometry is itself now divided into many research subtopics, two examples of which are projective algebraic geometry (the study of [projective varieties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_variety#Projective_varieties "Algebraic variety")) and [projective differential geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_differential_geometry "Projective differential geometry") (the study of [differential invariants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry "Differential geometry") of the projective transformations).

### Projective transformation

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Projective_space&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Projective transformation")]

In [projective geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_geometry "Projective geometry"), a [homography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homography "Homography") is an [isomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphism "Isomorphism") of projective spaces, induced by an isomorphism of the [vector spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space") from which the projective spaces derive.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_space#cite_note-4) It is a [bijection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijection "Bijection") that maps [lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_(geometry) "Line (geometry)") to lines, and thus a [collineation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collineation "Collineation"). In general, some collineations are not homographies, but the [fundamental theorem of projective geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homography#Fundamental_theorem_of_projective_geometry "Homography") asserts that is not so in the case of real projective spaces of dimension at least two. Synonyms include projectivity, projective transformation, and projective collineation.

Historically, homographies (and projective spaces) have been introduced to study [perspective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspectivity "Perspectivity") and [projections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projection_(mathematics) "Projection (mathematics)") in [Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry "Euclidean geometry"), and the term _homography_, which, etymologically, roughly means "similar drawing", dates from this time. At the end of the 19th century, formal definitions of projective spaces were introduced, which extended [Euclidean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space") and [affine spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_space "Affine space") by the addition of new points called [points at infinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_at_infinity "Points at infinity"). The term "projective transformation" originated in these abstract constructions. These constructions divide into two classes that have been shown to be equivalent. A projective space may be constructed as the set of the lines of a [vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space") over a given [field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics) "Field (mathematics)") (the above definition is based on this version); this construction facilitates the definition of [projective coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_coordinates "Projective coordinates") and allows using the tools of [linear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra "Linear algebra") for the study of homographies. The alternative approach consists in defining the projective space through a set of axioms, which do not involve explicitly any field ([incidence geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_geometry "Incidence geometry"), see also [synthetic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_geometry "Synthetic geometry")); in this context, collineations are easier to define than homographies, and homographies are defined as specific collineations, thus called "projective collineations".

For sake of simplicity, unless otherwise stated, the projective spaces considered in this article are supposed to be defined over a (commutative) [field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics) "Field (mathematics)"). Equivalently [Pappus's hexagon theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pappus%27s_hexagon_theorem "Pappus's hexagon theorem") and [Desargues's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desargues%27s_theorem "Desargues's theorem") are supposed to be true. A large part of the results remain true, or may be generalized to projective geometries for which these theorems do not hold.

In this section, all projective spaces are real projective spaces of finite dimension. However everything applies to complex projective spaces, with slight modifications.

A projective space is a [topological space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space "Topological space"), as endowed with the [quotient topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotient_topology "Quotient topology") of the topology of a finite dimensional real vector space.

Let S be the [unit sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_sphere "Unit sphere") in a normed vector space V, and consider the function ![Image 4: {\displaystyle \pi :S\to \mathbf {P} (V)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/dc05d768bcf66623447f86c1f30395969f2cf2ff) that maps a point of S to the vector line passing through it. This function is continuous and surjective. The inverse image of every point of **P**(_V_) consist of two [antipodal points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipodal_point "Antipodal point"). As spheres are [compact spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space "Compact space"), it follows that:

_A (finite dimensional) projective space is compact_.

For every point P of S, the restriction of π to a neighborhood of P is a [homeomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeomorphism "Homeomorphism") onto its image, provided that the neighborhood is small enough for not containing any pair of antipodal points. This shows that a projective space is a manifold. A simple [atlas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_(topology) "Atlas (topology)") can be provided, as follows.

As soon as a basis has been chosen for V, any vector can be identified with its coordinates on the basis, and any point of **P**(_V_) may be identified with its [homogeneous coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_coordinates "Homogeneous coordinates"). For _i_ = 0, ..., _n_, the set ![Image 5: {\displaystyle U_{i}=\{[x_{0}:\cdots :x_{n}],x_{i}\neq 0\}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/464921a3e53687360d8554f71d7f226bf624ca3a) is an open subset of **P**(_V_), and ![Image 6: {\displaystyle \mathbf {P} (V)=\bigcup _{i=0}^{n}U_{i}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d2f251cb0cfccce36e6295e6ca3be4571b9c71d4) since every point of **P**(_V_) has at least one nonzero coordinate.

To each _U_ _i_ is associated a [chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chart_(topology) "Chart (topology)"), which is the [homeomorphisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeomorphism "Homeomorphism")![Image 7: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\mathbb {\varphi } _{i}:R^{n}&\to U_{i}\\(y_{0},\dots ,{\widehat {y_{i}}},\dots ,y_{n})&\mapsto [y_{0}:\cdots :y_{i-1}:1:y_{i+1}:\cdots :y_{n}],\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/41847e240e4149d2183156ed90b2b3e2b45b4114) such that ![Image 8: {\displaystyle \varphi _{i}^{-1}\left([x_{0}:\cdots :x_{n}]\right)=\left({\frac {x_{0}}{x_{i}}},\dots ,{\widehat {\frac {x_{i}}{x_{i}}}},\dots ,{\frac {x_{n}}{x_{i}}}\right),}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/12635e1b90cf4572c0887b2cdc8a5141a538f465) where hats means that the corresponding term is missing.

These charts form an [atlas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_(topology) "Atlas (topology)"), and, as the [transition maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_map "Transition map") are [analytic functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_function "Analytic function"), it results that projective spaces are [analytic manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_manifold "Analytic manifold").

For example, in the case of _n_ = 1, that is of a projective line, there are only two _U_ _i_, which can each be identified to a copy of the [real line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_line "Real line"). In both lines, the intersection of the two charts is the set of nonzero real numbers, and the transition map is ![Image 10: {\displaystyle x\mapsto {\frac {1}{x}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d207e4d6d9278902dd0e1a54b1dab01f5b5037fa) in both directions. The image represents the projective line as a circle where antipodal points are identified, and shows the two homeomorphisms of a real line to the projective line; as antipodal points are identified, the image of each line is represented as an open half circle, which can be identified with the projective line with a single point removed.

### CW complex structure

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Projective_space&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: CW complex structure")]

Real projective spaces have a simple [CW complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CW_complex "CW complex") structure, as **P**_n_(**R**) can be obtained from **P**_n_−1(**R**) by attaching an _n_-cell with the quotient projection **S**_n_−1 → **P**_n_−1(**R**) as the attaching map.

Originally, [algebraic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry "Algebraic geometry") was the study of common zeros of sets of [multivariate polynomials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_polynomial "Multivariate polynomial"). These common zeros, called [algebraic varieties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_varieties "Algebraic varieties") belong to an [affine space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_space "Affine space"). It appeared soon, that in the case of real coefficients, one must consider all the complex zeros for having accurate results. For example, the [fundamental theorem of algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_algebra "Fundamental theorem of algebra") asserts that a univariate [square-free polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square-free_polynomial "Square-free polynomial") of degree n has exactly n complex roots. In the multivariate case, the consideration of complex zeros is also needed, but not sufficient: one must also consider _zeros at infinity_. For example, [Bézout's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zout%27s_theorem "Bézout's theorem") asserts that the intersection of two plane [algebraic curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_curve "Algebraic curve") of respective degrees d and e consists of exactly de points if one consider complex points in the projective plane, and if one counts the points with their multiplicity.[[b]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_space#cite_note-5) Another example is the [genus–degree formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus%E2%80%93degree_formula "Genus–degree formula") that allows computing the genus of a plane [algebraic curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_curve "Algebraic curve") from its [singularities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_point_of_a_curve "Singular point of a curve") in the _complex projective plane_.

So a [projective variety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_variety "Projective variety") is the set of points in a projective space, whose [homogeneous coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_coordinates "Homogeneous coordinates") are common zeros of a set of [homogeneous polynomials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_polynomial "Homogeneous polynomial").[[c]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_space#cite_note-6)

Any affine variety can be _completed_, in a unique way, into a projective variety by adding its [points at infinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_at_infinity "Points at infinity"), which consists of [homogenizing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogenization_of_a_polynomial "Homogenization of a polynomial") the defining polynomials, and removing the components that are contained in the hyperplane at infinity, by [saturating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturation_(commutative_algebra) "Saturation (commutative algebra)") with respect to the homogenizing variable.

An important property of projective spaces and projective varieties is that the image of a projective variety under a [morphism of algebraic varieties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphism_of_algebraic_varieties "Morphism of algebraic varieties") is closed for [Zariski topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zariski_topology "Zariski topology") (that is, it is an [algebraic set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_set "Algebraic set")). This is a generalization to every ground field of the compactness of the real and complex projective space.

A projective space is itself a projective variety, being the set of zeros of the zero polynomial.

Scheme theory, introduced by [Alexander Grothendieck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Grothendieck "Alexander Grothendieck") during the second half of 20th century, allows defining a generalization of algebraic varieties, called [schemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(mathematics) "Scheme (mathematics)"), by gluing together smaller pieces called [affine schemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_schemes "Affine schemes"), similarly as [manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold "Manifold") can be built by gluing together open sets of **R**_n_. The [Proj construction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proj_construction "Proj construction") is the construction of the scheme of a projective space, and, more generally of any projective variety, by gluing together affine schemes. In the case of projective spaces, one can take for these affine schemes the affine schemes associated to the charts (affine spaces) of the above description of a projective space as a manifold.

In [synthetic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_geometry "Synthetic geometry"), a **projective space**_S_ can be defined axiomatically as a set _P_ (the set of points), together with a set _L_ of subsets of _P_ (the set of lines), satisfying these axioms:[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_space#cite_note-7)

*   Each two distinct points _p_ and _q_ are in exactly one line.
*   [Veblen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oswald_Veblen "Oswald Veblen")'s axiom:[[d]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_space#cite_note-8) If _a_, _b_, _c_, _d_ are distinct points and the lines through _ab_ and _cd_ meet, then so do the lines through _ac_ and _bd_.
*   Any line has at least 3 points on it.

The last axiom eliminates reducible cases that can be written as a disjoint union of projective spaces together with 2-point lines joining any two points in distinct projective spaces. More abstractly, it can be defined as an [incidence structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_structure "Incidence structure")(_P_, _L_, _I_) consisting of a set _P_ of points, a set _L_ of lines, and an [incidence relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_relation "Incidence relation")_I_ that states which points lie on which lines.

The structures defined by these axioms are more general than those obtained from the vector space construction given above. If the (projective) dimension is at least three then, by the [Veblen–Young theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veblen%E2%80%93Young_theorem "Veblen–Young theorem"), there is no difference. However, for dimension two, there are examples that satisfy these axioms that can not be constructed from vector spaces (or even modules over division rings). These examples do not satisfy the [theorem of Desargues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theorem_of_Desargues "Theorem of Desargues") and are known as [non-Desarguesian planes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Desarguesian_plane "Non-Desarguesian plane"). In dimension one, any set with at least three elements satisfies the axioms, so it is usual to assume additional structure for projective lines defined axiomatically.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_space#cite_note-9)

It is possible to avoid the troublesome cases in low dimensions by adding or modifying axioms that define a projective space. [Coxeter (1969](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_space#CITEREFCoxeter1969), p.231) gives such an extension due to Bachmann.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_space#cite_note-10) To ensure that the dimension is at least two, replace the three point per line axiom above by:

*   There exist four points, no three of which are collinear.

To avoid the non-Desarguesian planes, include [Pappus's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pappus%27s_hexagon_theorem "Pappus's hexagon theorem") as an axiom;[[e]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_space#cite_note-11)

*   If the six vertices of a hexagon lie alternately on two lines, the three points of intersection of pairs of opposite sides are collinear.

And, to ensure that the vector space is defined over a field that does not have even [characteristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_(field) "Characteristic (field)") include _Fano's axiom_;[[f]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_space#cite_note-12)

*   The three diagonal points of a [complete quadrangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_quadrangle "Complete quadrangle") are never collinear.

A **subspace** of the projective space is a subset _X_, such that any line containing two points of _X_ is a subset of _X_ (that is, completely contained in _X_). The full space and the empty space are always subspaces.

The geometric dimension of the space is said to be _n_ if that is the largest number for which there is a strictly ascending chain of subspaces of this form: ![Image 11: {\displaystyle \varnothing =X_{-1}\subset X_{0}\subset \cdots X_{n}=P.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5fe67cd7e05581c8744e624509174a4b428aa6a7)

A subspace _X_ _i_ in such a chain is said to have (geometric) dimension _i_. Subspaces of dimension 0 are called _points_, those of dimension 1 are called _lines_ and so on. If the full space has dimension _n_ then any subspace of dimension _n_ − 1 is called a [hyperplane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplane "Hyperplane").

Projective spaces admit an equivalent formulation in terms of [lattice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_(order) "Lattice (order)") theory. There is a bijective correspondence between projective spaces and geomodular lattices, namely, [subdirectly irreducible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subdirectly_irreducible "Subdirectly irreducible"), [compactly generated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_element "Compact element"), [complemented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complemented_lattice "Complemented lattice"), [modular lattices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_lattice "Modular lattice").[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_space#cite_note-13)

*   Dimension 0 (no lines): The space is a single point.
*   Dimension 1 (exactly one line): All points lie on the unique line.
*   Dimension 2: There are at least 2 lines, and any two lines meet. A projective space for _n_ = 2 is equivalent to a [projective plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_plane "Projective plane"). These are much harder to classify, as not all of them are isomorphic with a PG(_d_, _K_). The [Desarguesian planes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desarguesian_plane "Desarguesian plane") (those that are isomorphic with a PG(2, _K_)) satisfy [Desargues's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desargues%27s_theorem "Desargues's theorem") and are projective planes over division rings, but there are many [non-Desarguesian planes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Desarguesian_plane "Non-Desarguesian plane").
*   Dimension at least 3: Two non-intersecting lines exist. [Veblen & Young (1965)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_space#CITEREFVeblenYoung1965) proved the [Veblen–Young theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veblen%E2%80%93Young_theorem "Veblen–Young theorem"), to the effect that every projective space of dimension _n_ ≥ 3 is isomorphic with a PG(_n_, _K_), the _n_-dimensional projective space over some [division ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_ring "Division ring")_K_.

### Finite projective spaces and planes

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Projective_space&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Finite projective spaces and planes")]

[![Image 12](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Fano_plane.svg/250px-Fano_plane.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Fano_plane.svg)

The [Fano plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fano_plane "Fano plane")

A _finite projective space_ is a projective space where _P_ is a finite set of points. In any finite projective space, each line contains the same number of points and the _order_ of the space is defined as one less than this common number. For finite projective spaces of dimension at least three, [Wedderburn's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedderburn%27s_little_theorem "Wedderburn's little theorem") implies that the division ring over which the projective space is defined must be a [finite field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_field "Finite field"), GF(_q_), whose order (that is, number of elements) is _q_ (a prime power). A finite projective space defined over such a finite field has _q_ + 1 points on a line, so the two concepts of order coincide. Notationally, PG(_n_, GF(_q_)) is usually written as PG(_n_, _q_).

All finite fields of the same order are isomorphic, so, up to isomorphism, there is only one finite projective space for each dimension greater than or equal to three, over a given finite field. However, in dimension two there are non-Desarguesian planes. Up to isomorphism there are

1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 4, 0, ... (sequence [A001231](https://oeis.org/A001231 "oeis:A001231") in the [OEIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-Line_Encyclopedia_of_Integer_Sequences "On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences"))

finite projective planes of orders 2, 3, 4, ..., 10, respectively. The numbers beyond this are very difficult to calculate and are not determined except for some zero values due to the [Bruck–Ryser theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruck%E2%80%93Ryser%E2%80%93Chowla_theorem "Bruck–Ryser–Chowla theorem").

The smallest projective plane is the [Fano plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fano_plane "Fano plane"), PG(2, 2) with 7 points and 7 lines. The smallest 3-dimensional projective space is [PG(3, 2)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PG(3,2) "PG(3,2)"), with 15 points, 35 lines and 15 planes.

Injective [linear maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_map "Linear map")_T_ ∈ _L_(_V_, _W_) between two vector spaces _V_ and _W_ over the same field _K_ induce mappings of the corresponding projective spaces **P**(_V_) → **P**(_W_) via:

[_v_] → [_T_(_v_)],

where _v_ is a non-zero element of _V_ and [...] denotes the equivalence classes of a vector under the defining identification of the respective projective spaces. Since members of the equivalence class differ by a scalar factor, and linear maps preserve scalar factors, this induced map is [well-defined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-defined "Well-defined"). (If _T_ is not injective, it has a [null space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_space "Null space") larger than {0}; in this case the meaning of the class of _T_(_v_) is problematic if _v_ is non-zero and in the null space. In this case one obtains a so-called [rational map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_map "Rational map"), see also _[Birational geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birational\_geometry "Birational geometry")_.)

Two linear maps _S_ and _T_ in _L_(_V_, _W_) induce the same map between **P**(_V_) and **P**(_W_)[if and only if](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_and_only_if "If and only if") they differ by a scalar multiple, that is if _T_ = _λS_ for some _λ_ ≠ 0. Thus if one identifies the scalar multiples of the [identity map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_function "Identity function") with the underlying field _K_, the set of _K_-linear [morphisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphism "Morphism") from **P**(_V_) to **P**(_W_) is simply **P**(_L_(_V_, _W_)).

The [automorphisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automorphism "Automorphism")**P**(_V_) → **P**(_V_) can be described more concretely. (We deal only with automorphisms preserving the base field _K_). Using the notion of [sheaves generated by global sections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ample_line_bundle "Ample line bundle"), it can be shown that any algebraic (not necessarily linear) automorphism must be linear, i.e., coming from a (linear) automorphism of the vector space _V_. The latter form the [group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics) "Group (mathematics)")[GL(_V_)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_linear_group "General linear group"). By identifying maps that differ by a scalar, one concludes that

Aut(**P**(_V_)) = Aut(_V_) / _K_× = GL(_V_) / _K_× =: PGL(_V_),

the [quotient group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotient_group "Quotient group") of GL(_V_) modulo the matrices that are scalar multiples of the identity. (These matrices form the [center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_a_group "Center of a group") of Aut(_V_).) The groups PGL are called [projective linear groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_linear_group "Projective linear group"). The automorphisms of the complex projective line **P**1(**C**) are called [Möbius transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6bius_transformation "Möbius transformation").

Dual projective space
---------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Projective_space&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Dual projective space")]

When the construction above is applied to the [dual space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_space "Dual space")_V_∗ rather than _V_, one obtains the dual projective space, which can be canonically identified with the space of hyperplanes through the origin of _V_. That is, if _V_ is _n_-dimensional, then **P**(_V_∗) is the [Grassmannian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassmannian "Grassmannian") of _n_ − 1 planes in _V_.

In algebraic geometry, this construction allows for greater flexibility in the construction of projective bundles. One would like to be able to associate a projective space to _every_ quasi-coherent sheaf _E_ over a scheme _Y_, not just the locally free ones.[_[clarification needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please\_clarify "Wikipedia:Please clarify")_] See [EGA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89l%C3%A9ments_de_g%C3%A9om%C3%A9trie_alg%C3%A9brique "Éléments de géométrie algébrique")II, Chap. II, par. 4 for more details.

dimension The projective space, being the "space" of all one-dimensional linear subspaces of a given vector space _V_ is generalized to [Grassmannian manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassmannian_manifold "Grassmannian manifold"), which is parametrizing higher-dimensional subspaces (of some fixed dimension) of _V_.sequence of subspaces More generally [flag manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_manifold "Flag manifold") is the space of flags, i.e., chains of linear subspaces of _V_.other subvarieties Even more generally, [moduli spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moduli_space "Moduli space") parametrize objects such as [elliptic curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve "Elliptic curve") of a given kind.other rings Generalizing to associative [rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_(mathematics) "Ring (mathematics)") (rather than only fields) yields, for example, the [projective line over a ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_line_over_a_ring "Projective line over a ring").patching Patching projective spaces together yields [projective space bundles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_space_bundles "Projective space bundles").
[Severi–Brauer varieties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severi%E2%80%93Brauer_variety "Severi–Brauer variety") are [algebraic varieties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_varieties "Algebraic varieties") over a field _K_, which become isomorphic to projective spaces after an extension of the base field _K_.

Another generalization of projective spaces are [weighted projective spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_projective_space "Weighted projective space"); these are themselves special cases of [toric varieties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toric_variety "Toric variety").[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_space#cite_note-14)
