Macdonald" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( August 2023 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Macdonald at Oberwolfach in 1977 Ian Grant Macdonald FRS (11 October 1928 – 8 August 2023) was a British mathematician known for his contributions to symmetric functions , special functions , Lie algebra theory and other aspects of algebra , algebraic combinatorics , and combinatorics .

Early life and education [ edit ] Born in London, he was educated at Winchester College and Trinity College, Cambridge , graduating in 1952.

Career [ edit ] He then spent five years as a civil servant. He was offered a position at Manchester University in 1957 by Max Newman , on the basis of work he had done while outside academia. In 1960 he moved to the University of Exeter , and in 1963 became a Fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford . Macdonald became Fielden Professor at Manchester in 1972, and professor at Queen Mary College, University of London , in 1976.

He worked on symmetric products of algebraic curves , Jordan algebras and the representation theory of groups over local fields . In 1972 he proved the Macdonald identities , after a pattern known to Freeman Dyson . His 1979 book Symmetric Functions and Hall Polynomials has become a classic. Symmetric functions are an old theory, part of the theory of equations , to which both K-theory and representation theory lead. His was the first text to integrate much classical theory, such as Hall polynomials , Schur functions , the Littlewood–Richardson rule , with the abstract algebra approach. It was both an expository work and, in part, a research monograph, and had a major impact in the field. The Macdonald polynomials are now named after him. The Macdonald conjectures from 1982 also proved most influential.

Macdonald was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1979. He was an invited speaker in 1970 at the International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) in Nice [ 1 ] and a plenary speaker in 1998 at the ICM in Berlin.

[ 2 ] In 1991 he received the Pólya Prize of the London Mathematical Society .

[ 3 ] In 2002 he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Amsterdam .

[ 4 ] He was awarded the 2009 Steele Prize for Mathematical Exposition. In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society .

[ 5 ] Personal life and death [ edit ] Ian G. Macdonald died on 8 August 2023, at the age of 94.
