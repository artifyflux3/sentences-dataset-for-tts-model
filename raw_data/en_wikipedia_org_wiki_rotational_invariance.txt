Mathematics [ edit ] Functions [ edit ] For example, the function f ( x , y ) = x 2 + y 2 {\displaystyle f(x,y)=x^{2}+y^{2}} is invariant under rotations of the plane around the origin, because for a rotated set of coordinates through any angle θ x ′ = x cos ⁡ ⁡ θ θ − − y sin ⁡ ⁡ θ θ {\displaystyle x'=x\cos \theta -y\sin \theta } y ′ = x sin ⁡ ⁡ θ θ + y cos ⁡ ⁡ θ θ {\displaystyle y'=x\sin \theta +y\cos \theta } the function, after some cancellation of terms, takes exactly the same form f ( x ′ , y ′ ) = x 2 + y 2 {\displaystyle f(x',y')={x}^{2}+{y}^{2}} The rotation of coordinates can be expressed using matrix form using the rotation matrix , [ x ′ y ′ ] = [ cos ⁡ ⁡ θ θ − − sin ⁡ ⁡ θ θ sin ⁡ ⁡ θ θ cos ⁡ ⁡ θ θ ] [ x y ] , {\displaystyle {\begin{bmatrix}x'\\y'\\\end{bmatrix}}={\begin{bmatrix}\cos \theta &-\sin \theta \\\sin \theta &\cos \theta \\\end{bmatrix}}{\begin{bmatrix}x\\y\\\end{bmatrix}},} or symbolically, x ′ = Rx . Symbolically, the rotation invariance of a real-valued function of two real variables is f ( x ′ ) = f ( R x ) = f ( x ) {\displaystyle f(\mathbf {x} ')=f(\mathbf {Rx} )=f(\mathbf {x} )} In words, the function of the rotated coordinates takes exactly the same form as it did with the initial coordinates, the only difference is the rotated coordinates replace the initial ones. For a real-valued function of three or more real variables , this expression extends easily using appropriate rotation matrices.

The concept also extends to a vector-valued function f of one or more variables; f ( x ′ ) = f ( R x ) = f ( x ) .

{\displaystyle \mathbf {f} (\mathbf {x} ')=\mathbf {f} (\mathbf {Rx} )=\mathbf {f} (\mathbf {x} ).} In all the above cases, the arguments (here called "coordinates" for concreteness) are rotated, not the function itself.

Operators [ edit ] For a function f : X → → X , {\displaystyle f:X\rightarrow X,} which maps elements from a subset X of the real line R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } to itself, rotational invariance may also mean that the function commutes with rotations of elements in X . This also applies for an operator that acts on such functions. An example is the two-dimensional Laplace operator ∇ ∇ 2 = ∂ ∂ 2 ∂ ∂ x 2 + ∂ ∂ 2 ∂ ∂ y 2 , {\displaystyle \nabla ^{2}={\frac {\partial ^{2}}{\partial x^{2}}}+{\frac {\partial ^{2}}{\partial y^{2}}},} which acts on a function f to obtain another function ∇ 2 f . This operator is invariant under rotations.

If g is the function g ( p ) = f ( R ( p )), where R is any rotation, then (∇ 2 g )( p ) = (∇ 2 f )( R ( p )); that is, rotating a function merely rotates its Laplacian.

Physics [ edit ] In physics , if a system behaves the same regardless of how it is oriented in space, then its Lagrangian is rotationally invariant. According to Noether's theorem , if the action (the integral over time of its Lagrangian) of a physical system is invariant under rotation, then angular momentum is conserved .

Application to quantum mechanics [ edit ] Further information: Rotation operator (quantum mechanics) and Symmetry in quantum mechanics In quantum mechanics , rotational invariance is the property that after a rotation the new system still obeys the Schrödinger equation .  That is [ R , E − − H ] = 0 {\displaystyle [R,E-H]=0} for any rotation R . Since the rotation does not depend explicitly on time, it commutes with the energy operator. Thus for rotational invariance we must have [ R , H ] = 0.

For infinitesimal rotations (in the xy -plane for this example; it may be done likewise for any plane) by an angle dθ the (infinitesimal) rotation operator is R = 1 + J z d θ θ , {\displaystyle R=1+J_{z}d\theta \,,} then [ 1 + J z d θ θ , d d t ] = 0 , {\displaystyle \left[1+J_{z}d\theta ,{\frac {d}{dt}}\right]=0\,,} thus d d t J z = 0 , {\displaystyle {\frac {d}{dt}}J_{z}=0\,,} in other words angular momentum is conserved.
