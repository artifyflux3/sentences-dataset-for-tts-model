In [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry"), the [area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area "Area") enclosed by a [circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle "Circle") of [radius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radius "Radius")r is π _r_ 2. Here, the Greek letter [π](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi "Pi") represents the [constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_(mathematics) "Constant (mathematics)") ratio of the [circumference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumference "Circumference") of any circle to its [diameter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter "Diameter"), approximately equal to 3.14159.

One method of deriving this formula, which originated with [Archimedes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes "Archimedes"), involves viewing the circle as the [limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_(mathematics) "Limit (mathematics)") of a sequence of [regular polygons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_polygon "Regular polygon") with an increasing number of sides. The area of a regular polygon is half its [perimeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perimeter "Perimeter") multiplied by the [distance from its center to its sides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apothem "Apothem"), and because the sequence tends to a circle, the corresponding formula–that the area is half the [circumference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumference "Circumference") times the radius–namely, _A_ = ⁠1/2⁠ × 2π _r_ × _r_, holds for a circle.

Although often referred to as the area of a circle in informal contexts, strictly speaking, the term [disk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_(mathematics) "Disk (mathematics)") refers to the interior region of the circle, while circle is reserved for the boundary only, which is a [curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve "Curve") and covers no area itself. Therefore, the area of a disk is the more precise phrase for the area enclosed by a circle.

Modern mathematics can obtain the area using the methods of [integral calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral "Integral") or its more sophisticated offspring, [real analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_analysis "Real analysis"). However, the area of a disk was studied by the [Ancient Greeks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greeks "Ancient Greeks"). [Eudoxus of Cnidus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eudoxus_of_Cnidus "Eudoxus of Cnidus") in the fifth century B.C. had found that the area of a disk is proportional to its radius squared.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_of_a_circle#cite_note-1)[Archimedes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes "Archimedes") used the tools of [Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry "Euclidean geometry") to show that the area inside a circle is equal to that of a [right triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_triangle "Right triangle") whose base has the length of the circle's circumference and whose height equals the circle's radius in his book _[Measurement of a Circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement\_of\_a\_Circle "Measurement of a Circle")_. The circumference is 2 π _r_, and the area of a triangle is half the base times the height, yielding the area π _r_ 2 for the disk. Prior to Archimedes, [Hippocrates of Chios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocrates_of_Chios "Hippocrates of Chios") was the first to show that the area of a disk is proportional to the square of its diameter, as part of his quadrature of the [lune of Hippocrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lune_of_Hippocrates "Lune of Hippocrates"),[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_of_a_circle#cite_note-heath-2) but did not identify the [constant of proportionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_of_proportionality "Constant of proportionality").

Historical arguments
--------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Area_of_a_circle&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Historical arguments")]

A variety of arguments have been advanced historically to establish the equation ![Image 1: {\displaystyle A=\pi r^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/33f7b7f93f93e7ba7bebb97efbe88e181ce332e4) to varying degrees of mathematical rigor. The most famous of these is Archimedes' [method of exhaustion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_exhaustion "Method of exhaustion"), one of the earliest uses of the mathematical concept of a [limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_(mathematics) "Limit (mathematics)"), as well as the origin of [Archimedes' axiom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedean_property "Archimedean property") which remains part of the standard analytical treatment of the [real number system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number_system "Real number system"). The original proof of Archimedes is not rigorous by modern standards, because it assumes that we can compare the length of arc of a circle to the length of a secant and a tangent line, and similar statements about the area, as geometrically evident.

The area of a [regular polygon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_polygon "Regular polygon") is half its perimeter times the [apothem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apothem "Apothem"). As the number of sides of the regular polygon increases, the polygon tends to a circle, and the apothem tends to the radius. This suggests that the area of a disk is half the circumference of its bounding circle times the radius.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_of_a_circle#cite_note-3)

Following Archimedes' argument in _The Measurement of a Circle_ (c. 260 BCE), compare the area enclosed by a circle to a right triangle whose base has the length of the circle's circumference and whose height equals the circle's radius. If the area of the circle is not equal to that of the triangle, then it must be either greater or less. We eliminate each of these by contradiction, leaving equality as the only possibility. We use [regular polygons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_polygon "Regular polygon") in the same way.

[![Image 2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Archimedes_circle_area_proof_-_inscribed_polygons.svg/250px-Archimedes_circle_area_proof_-_inscribed_polygons.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Archimedes_circle_area_proof_-_inscribed_polygons.svg)

Circle with square and octagon inscribed, showing area gap

Suppose that the area _C_ enclosed by the circle is greater than the area _T_= _cr_/2 of the triangle. Let _E_ denote the excess amount. [Inscribe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inscribe "Inscribe") a square in the circle, so that its four corners lie on the circle. Between the square and the circle are four segments. If the total area of those gaps, _G_ 4, is greater than _E_, split each arc in half. This makes the inscribed square into an inscribed octagon, and produces eight segments with a smaller total gap, _G_ 8. Continue splitting until the total gap area, _G n_, is less than _E_. Now the area of the inscribed polygon, _P n_= _C_−_G n_, must be greater than that of the triangle.

![Image 3: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}E&{}=C-T\\&{}>G_{n}\\P_{n}&{}=C-G_{n}\\&{}>C-E\\P_{n}&{}>T\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9eea5190954993f21d627d7df6b1f2e670939704)
But this forces a contradiction, as follows. Draw a perpendicular from the center to the midpoint of a side of the polygon; its length, _h_, is less than the circle radius. Also, let each side of the polygon have length _s_; then the sum of the sides is _ns_, which is less than the circle circumference. The polygon area consists of _n_ equal triangles with height _h_ and base _s_, thus equals _nhs_/2. But since _h_<_r_ and _ns_<_c_, the polygon area must be less than the triangle area, _cr_/2, a contradiction. Therefore, our supposition that _C_ might be greater than _T_ must be wrong.

[![Image 4](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Archimedes_circle_area_proof_-_circumscribed_polygons.svg/250px-Archimedes_circle_area_proof_-_circumscribed_polygons.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Archimedes_circle_area_proof_-_circumscribed_polygons.svg)

Circle with square and octagon circumscribed, showing area gap

Suppose that the area enclosed by the circle is less than the area _T_ of the triangle. Let _D_ denote the deficit amount. Circumscribe a square, so that the midpoint of each edge lies on the circle. If the total area gap between the square and the circle, _G_ 4, is greater than _D_, slice off the corners with circle tangents to make a circumscribed octagon, and continue slicing until the gap area is less than _D_. The area of the polygon, _P n_, must be less than _T_.

![Image 5: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}D&{}=T-C\\&{}>G_{n}\\P_{n}&{}=C+G_{n}\\&{}<C+D\\P_{n}&{}<T\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7552fdb6c51f509baab5d42220ea17fcb69a7e76)
This, too, forces a contradiction. For, a perpendicular to the midpoint of each polygon side is a radius, of length _r_. And since the total side length is greater than the circumference, the polygon consists of _n_ identical triangles with total area greater than _T_. Again we have a contradiction, so our supposition that _C_ might be less than _T_ must be wrong as well.

Therefore, it must be the case that the area enclosed by the circle is precisely the same as the area of the triangle. This concludes the proof.

### Rearrangement proof

Circle area by rearrangement

[![Image 7](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Regular_polygon_side_count_graph.svg/250px-Regular_polygon_side_count_graph.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Regular_polygon_side_count_graph.svg)

Graphs of [side](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_(geometry) "Edge (geometry)"), _s_; [apothem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apothem "Apothem"), _a_; and [area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area "Area"), _A_ of [regular polygons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_polygon "Regular polygon") of _n_ sides and [circumradius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumradius "Circumradius") 1, with the [base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_(geometry) "Base (geometry)"), _b_ of a [rectangle with the same area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_of_a_circle#Rearrangement_proof). The green line shows the case [_n_ = 6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_hexagon "Regular hexagon").

Following Satō Moshun ([Smith & Mikami 1914](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_of_a_circle#CITEREFSmithMikami1914), pp.130–132), [Nicholas of Cusa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_of_Cusa "Nicholas of Cusa")[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_of_a_circle#cite_note-4) and [Leonardo da Vinci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci "Leonardo da Vinci") ([Beckmann 1976](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_of_a_circle#CITEREFBeckmann1976), p.19), we can use inscribed regular polygons in a different way. Suppose we inscribe a [hexagon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagon "Hexagon"). Cut the hexagon into six triangles by splitting it from the center. Two opposite triangles both touch two common diameters; slide them along one so the radial edges are adjacent. They now form a [parallelogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallelogram "Parallelogram"), with the hexagon sides making two opposite edges, one of which is the base, _s_. Two radial edges form slanted sides, and the height, _h_ is equal to its [apothem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apothem "Apothem") (as in the Archimedes proof). In fact, we can also assemble all the triangles into one big parallelogram by putting successive pairs next to each other. The same is true if we increase it to eight sides and so on. For a polygon with 2 _n_ sides, the parallelogram will have a base of length _ns_, and a height _h_. As the number of sides increases, the length of the parallelogram base approaches half the circle circumference, and its height approaches the circle radius. In the limit, the parallelogram becomes a rectangle with width π _r_ and height _r_.

_**Unit disk area by rearranging n polygons.**_| polygon |  | parallelogram |

There are various equivalent definitions of the constant π. The conventional definition in pre-calculus geometry is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter:

![Image 8: {\displaystyle \pi ={\frac {C}{D}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b44baebd9c828a9c0f10524c60b4c86dfb069c2a)
However, because the circumference of a circle is not a primitive analytical concept, this definition is not suitable in modern rigorous treatments. A standard modern definition is that π is equal to twice the least positive root of the [cosine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine "Cosine") function or, equivalently, the half-period of the [sine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine "Sine") (or cosine) function. The cosine function can be defined either as a [power series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_series "Power series"), or as the solution of a certain [differential equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation "Differential equation"). This avoids any reference to circles in the definition of π, so that statements about the relation of π to the circumference and area of circles are actually theorems, rather than definitions, that follow from the analytical definitions of concepts like "area" and "circumference".

The analytical definitions are seen to be equivalent, if it is agreed that the circumference of the circle is measured as a [rectifiable curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifiable_curve "Rectifiable curve") by means of the [integral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral "Integral")

![Image 9: {\displaystyle C=2\int _{-R}^{R}{\frac {R\,dx}{\sqrt {R^{2}-x^{2}}}}=2R\int _{-1}^{1}{\frac {dx}{\sqrt {1-x^{2}}}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/cb2c7ee46379feaa312f11aa0bb52b10110f3a16)
The integral appearing on the right is an [abelian integral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelian_integral "Abelian integral") whose value is a half-period of the [sine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine "Sine") function, equal to π. Thus ![Image 10: {\displaystyle C=2\pi R=\pi D}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/daf001d870a834f75dbf9bbbe40b67b0d26b2b6c) is seen to be true as a theorem.

Several of the arguments that follow use only concepts from elementary calculus to reproduce the formula ![Image 11: {\displaystyle A=\pi r^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/33f7b7f93f93e7ba7bebb97efbe88e181ce332e4), but in many cases to regard these as actual proofs, they rely implicitly on the fact that one can develop trigonometric functions and the fundamental constant π in a way that is totally independent of their relation to geometry. We have indicated where appropriate how each of these proofs can be made totally independent of all trigonometry, but in some cases that requires more sophisticated mathematical ideas than those afforded by elementary calculus.

Area of the disk via ring integration

Using calculus, we can sum the area incrementally, partitioning the disk into thin concentric rings like the layers of an [onion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onion "Onion"). This is the method of [shell integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_integration "Shell integration") in two dimensions. For an infinitesimally thin ring of the "onion" of radius _t_, the accumulated area is 2 π _t dt_, the circumferential length of the ring times its infinitesimal width (one can approximate this ring by a rectangle with width=2 π _t_ and height=_dt_). This gives an elementary integral for a disk of radius _r_.

![Image 13: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\mathrm {Area} (r)&{}=\int _{0}^{r}2\pi t\,dt\\&{}=2\pi \left[{\frac {t^{2}}{2}}\right]_{0}^{r}\\&{}=\pi r^{2}.\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/22d49256b6928ac3b3624a749b47be687a62092e)
It is rigorously justified by the [multivariate substitution rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_by_substitution#Substitution_for_multiple_variables "Integration by substitution") in polar coordinates. Namely, the area is given by a [double integral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_integral "Double integral") of the constant function 1 over the disk itself. If _D_ denotes the disk, then the double integral can be computed in [polar coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_coordinates "Polar coordinates") as follows:

![Image 14: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\mathrm {Area} (r)&{}=\iint _{D}1\ d(x,y)\\&{}=\iint _{D}t\ dt\ d\theta \\&{}=\int _{0}^{r}\int _{0}^{2\pi }t\ d\theta \ dt\\&{}=\int _{0}^{r}\left[t\theta \right]_{0}^{2\pi }dt\\&{}=\int _{0}^{r}2\pi t\,dt\\\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a18dc84550f7b8aec1a8eabb3d29d23a66147d9e)
which is the same result as obtained above.

An equivalent rigorous justification, without relying on the special coordinates of trigonometry, uses the [coarea formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coarea_formula "Coarea formula"). Define a function ![Image 15: {\displaystyle \rho :\mathbb {R} ^{2}\to \mathbb {R} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6f6a2003b3ea2e729bd9f05a5ebaae840e00c32b) by ![Image 16: {\textstyle \rho (x,y)={\sqrt {x^{2}+y^{2}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/814ac6fc88a67675f2eb558b67d825c48c24bd69). Note ρ is a [Lipschitz function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipschitz_function "Lipschitz function") whose [gradient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient "Gradient") is a unit vector ![Image 17: {\displaystyle |\nabla \rho |=1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4052f4ce9686e0fe9ad45664c38a2faa0c35b4aa) ([almost everywhere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almost_everywhere "Almost everywhere")). Let _D_ be the disc ![Image 18: {\displaystyle \rho <1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/df5f4f072a10e5f3c66c5ca6bbf24df526f0706d) in ![Image 19: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e150115ab9f63023215109595b76686a1ff890fd). We will show that ![Image 20: {\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}^{2}(D)=\pi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b6ff09bb5b41401f3f1992a621448cbee5024d72), where ![Image 21: {\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e212255ffc118973a6a2a83d380004b12d46280f) is the two-dimensional Lebesgue measure in ![Image 22: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e150115ab9f63023215109595b76686a1ff890fd). We shall assume that the one-dimensional [Hausdorff measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_measure "Hausdorff measure") of the circle ![Image 23: {\displaystyle \rho =r}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/40db75722182575603fb982d7ddab4863bef1079) is ![Image 24: {\displaystyle 2\pi r}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/71e811131a9c6c5f45e6657e0fc506e7e2a37f06), the circumference of the circle of radius _r_. (This can be taken as the definition of circumference.) Then, by the coarea formula,

![Image 25: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\mathcal {L}}^{2}(D)&=\iint _{D}|\nabla \rho |\,d{\mathcal {L}}^{2}\\&=\int _{\mathbb {R} }{\mathcal {H}}^{1}(\rho ^{-1}(r)\cap D)\,dr\\&=\int _{0}^{1}{\mathcal {H}}^{1}(\rho ^{-1}(r))\,dr\\&=\int _{0}^{1}2\pi r\,dr=\pi .\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1d9922e76813f4e7863a3cfcb78ce47ce26e7688)[![Image 26](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/TriangleFromCircle.gif/250px-TriangleFromCircle.gif)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:TriangleFromCircle.gif)

Circle unwrapped to form a triangle

[![Image 27](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Area_of_circle_and_triangle.svg/250px-Area_of_circle_and_triangle.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Area_of_circle_and_triangle.svg)

The circle and the triangle are equal in area.

Similar to the onion proof outlined above, we could exploit calculus in a different way in order to arrive at the formula for the area of a disk. Consider unwrapping the concentric circles to straight strips. This will form a right angled triangle with r as its height and 2 π r (being the outer slice of onion) as its base.

Finding the area of this triangle will give the area of the disk

![Image 28: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\text{Area}}&{}={\frac {1}{2}}\cdot {\text{base}}\cdot {\text{height}}\\[6pt]&{}={\frac {1}{2}}\cdot 2\pi r\cdot r\\[6pt]&{}=\pi r^{2}\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ec19d8244481b4f7c1aae8b9d31cb2e251488a17)
The opposite and adjacent angles for this triangle are respectively in degrees 9.0430611..., 80.956939... and in radians 0.1578311... [OEIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-Line_Encyclopedia_of_Integer_Sequences "On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences"):[A233527](https://oeis.org/A233527 "oeis:A233527"), 1.4129651...[OEIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-Line_Encyclopedia_of_Integer_Sequences "On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences"):[A233528](https://oeis.org/A233528 "oeis:A233528").

Explicitly, we imagine dividing up a circle into triangles, each with a height equal to the circle's radius and a base that is infinitesimally small. The area of each of these triangles is equal to ![Image 29: {\displaystyle 1/2\cdot r\cdot du}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5d1a066a0fa3a8379f94f0488949a50a92c8245a). By summing up (integrating) all of the areas of these triangles, we arrive at the formula for the circle's area:

![Image 30: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\mathrm {Area} (r)&{}=\int _{0}^{2\pi r}{\frac {1}{2}}r\,du\\[6pt]&{}=\left[{\frac {1}{2}}ru\right]_{0}^{2\pi r}\\[6pt]&{}=\pi r^{2}.\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a2645ee843189090de6367ebb0d8c4a66c24c228)
It too can be justified by a double integral of the constant function 1 over the disk by reversing the [order of integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_integration_(calculus) "Order of integration (calculus)") and using a change of variables in the above iterated integral:

![Image 31: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\mathrm {Area} (r)&{}=\iint _{D}1\ d(x,y)\\&{}=\iint _{D}t\ dt\ d\theta \\&{}=\int _{0}^{2\pi }\int _{0}^{r}t\ dt\ d\theta \\&{}=\int _{0}^{2\pi }{\frac {1}{2}}r^{2}\ d\theta \\\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/de81dd427b118bc3e9d4a917d77f4406bfb1fe0a)
Making the substitution ![Image 32: {\displaystyle u=r\theta ,\ du=r\ d\theta }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4b19964ea4f443c319f4aed924828774b95c5517) converts the integral to

![Image 33: {\displaystyle \int _{0}^{2\pi r}{\frac {1}{2}}{\frac {r^{2}}{r}}du=\int _{0}^{2\pi r}{\frac {1}{2}}r\ du}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3c7183156a76a4a5bcdb9a2289222d1d93a5e6b7)
which is the same as the above result.

The triangle proof can be reformulated as an application of [Green's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green%27s_theorem "Green's theorem") in flux-divergence form (i.e. a two-dimensional version of the [divergence theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergence_theorem "Divergence theorem")), in a way that avoids all mention of trigonometry and the constant π. Consider the [vector field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_field "Vector field")![Image 34: {\displaystyle \mathbf {r} =x\mathbf {i} +y\mathbf {j} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d470fc9fb71b4743145c5b179c8786875bba3977) in the plane. So the [divergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergence "Divergence") of **r** is equal to two, and hence the area of a disc _D_ is equal to

![Image 35: {\displaystyle A={\frac {1}{2}}\iint _{D}\operatorname {div} \mathbf {r} \,dA.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/cdf275d2d0d2c53bdfb01ee5bad56a05480a9d44)
By Green's theorem, this is the same as the outward flux of **r** across the circle bounding _D_:

![Image 36: {\displaystyle A={\frac {1}{2}}\oint _{\partial D}\mathbf {r} \cdot \mathbf {n} \,ds}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/52bee127996b453f1fad60b360989356d549f525)
where **n** is the unit normal and _ds_ is the arc length measure. For a circle of radius _R_ centered at the origin, we have ![Image 37: {\displaystyle |\mathbf {r} |=R}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7511197c0f4304212bd12c09e54c7fd0232ed69f) and ![Image 38: {\displaystyle \mathbf {n} =\mathbf {r} /R}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7476aeda8c221fe956de8e5bc3ccaf897f9c5455), so the above equality is

![Image 39: {\displaystyle A={\frac {1}{2}}\oint _{\partial D}\mathbf {r} \cdot {\frac {\mathbf {r} }{R}}\,ds={\frac {R}{2}}\oint _{\partial D}\,ds.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/061fa4fae000ac530fc3e68efd538a082ee3284a)
The integral of _ds_ over the whole circle ![Image 40: {\displaystyle \partial D}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f8fb77a08a342eb44226f19fd7c30314628075a1) is just the arc length, which is its circumference, so this shows that the area _A_ enclosed by the circle is equal to ![Image 41: {\displaystyle R/2}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f9ca7642176d9979f70675631339f834ef25abbf) times the circumference of the circle.

Another proof that uses triangles considers the area enclosed by a circle to be made up of an infinite number of triangles (i.e. the triangles each have an angle of _d𝜃_ at the center of the circle), each with an area of ⁠1/2⁠ · _r_ 2 · _d𝜃_ (derived from the expression for the area of a triangle: ⁠1/2⁠ · _a_ · _b_ · sin _𝜃_ = ⁠1/2⁠ · _r_ · _r_ · sin(_d𝜃_) = ⁠1/2⁠ · _r_ 2 · _d𝜃_). Note that sin(_d𝜃_) ≈ _d𝜃_ due to [small angle approximation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small-angle_approximation "Small-angle approximation"). Through summing the areas of the triangles, the expression for the area of the circle can therefore be found: ![Image 42: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\mathrm {Area} &{}=\int _{0}^{2\pi }{\frac {1}{2}}r^{2}\,d\theta \\&{}=\left[{\frac {1}{2}}r^{2}\theta \right]_{0}^{2\pi }\\&{}=\pi r^{2}.\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2f1ff8135211ae36e2d3087475420d550281b254)

Note that the area of a semicircle of radius _r_ can be computed by the integral ![Image 43: {\textstyle \int _{-r}^{r}{\sqrt {r^{2}-x^{2}}}\,dx}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4643d34e13ebc90791bbb972bb189c4f262db79b).

A semicircle of radius _r_

By [trigonometric substitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometric_substitution "Trigonometric substitution"), we substitute ![Image 45: {\displaystyle x=r\sin \theta }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1e930a2d8e0926d2d202d0be3d0f24fc2e0fdcf0), hence ![Image 46: {\displaystyle dx=r\cos \theta \,d\theta .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/cfd31939f56d3ec88039e9f9953b67268881a991)![Image 47: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\int _{-r}^{r}{\sqrt {r^{2}-x^{2}}}\,dx&=\int _{-{\frac {\pi }{2}}}^{\frac {\pi }{2}}{\sqrt {r^{2}\left(1-\sin ^{2}\theta \right)}}\cdot r\cos \theta \,d\theta \\[5pt]&=2r^{2}\int _{0}^{\frac {\pi }{2}}\cos ^{2}\theta \,d\theta \\[5pt]&={\frac {\pi r^{2}}{2}}.\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5e4afdcf935f2a5eeb4493a4db90318db065d024)

The last step follows since the trigonometric identity ![Image 48: {\displaystyle \cos(\theta )=\sin(\pi /2-\theta )}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6fffb293c041aa16d6a7c93b1df65919d55bac8c) implies that ![Image 49: {\displaystyle \cos ^{2}\theta }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/311894fdc65ae89f6b2e40edac3d3281a0727680) and ![Image 50: {\displaystyle \sin ^{2}\theta }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/02635acae84e17f9bae3ce887b425276ffeaa1a0) have equal integrals over the interval ![Image 51: {\displaystyle [0,\pi /2]}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/db58baa407ae179d23402f61cb3edcfd7e4fa5b1), using [integration by substitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_by_substitution "Integration by substitution"). But on the other hand, since ![Image 52: {\displaystyle \cos ^{2}\theta +\sin ^{2}\theta =1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9333418071b0b0662ba53f8983fe1cbb613ad005), the sum of the two integrals is the length of that interval, which is ![Image 53: {\displaystyle \pi /2}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2b44e3d874a0b229fded7ffce67a0677dd5b8b67). Consequently, the integral of ![Image 54: {\displaystyle \cos ^{2}\theta }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/311894fdc65ae89f6b2e40edac3d3281a0727680) is equal to half the length of that interval, which is ![Image 55: {\displaystyle \pi /4}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1707aa0fec2c8ef008b9e30b6045fbf95dab9e20).

Therefore, the area of a circle of radius _r_, which is twice the area of the semi-circle, is equal to ![Image 56: {\displaystyle 2\cdot {\frac {\pi r^{2}}{2}}=\pi r^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7e0d08b5a6c75c8a3bc169c815ac578ef7a5bf3f).

This particular proof may appear to beg the question, if the sine and cosine functions involved in the trigonometric substitution are regarded as being defined in relation to circles. However, as noted earlier, it is possible to define sine, cosine, and π in a way that is totally independent of trigonometry, in which case the proof is valid by the [change of variables formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_of_variables_formula "Change of variables formula") and [Fubini's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fubini%27s_theorem "Fubini's theorem"), assuming the basic properties of sine and cosine (which can also be proved without assuming anything about their relation to circles).

Isoperimetric inequality
------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Area_of_a_circle&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Isoperimetric inequality")]

The circle is the closed curve of least perimeter that encloses the maximum area. This is known as the [isoperimetric inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoperimetric_inequality "Isoperimetric inequality"), which states that if a rectifiable Jordan curve in the Euclidean plane has perimeter _C_ and encloses an area _A_ (by the [Jordan curve theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_curve_theorem "Jordan curve theorem")) then

![Image 57: {\displaystyle 4\pi A\leq C^{2}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/206d5cd0fa0bfd674f559f687893f311dca9235c)
Moreover, equality holds in this inequality if and only if the curve is a circle, in which case ![Image 58: {\displaystyle A=\pi r^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/33f7b7f93f93e7ba7bebb97efbe88e181ce332e4) and ![Image 59: {\displaystyle C=2\pi r}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/398305eb631c365e21449ec4e9c9d7dca3f8c788).

The calculations Archimedes used to approximate the area numerically were laborious, and he stopped with a polygon of 96 sides. A faster method uses ideas of [Willebrord Snell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willebrord_Snell "Willebrord Snell") (_Cyclometricus_, 1621), further developed by [Christiaan Huygens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christiaan_Huygens "Christiaan Huygens") (_De Circuli Magnitudine Inventa_, 1654), described in [Gerretsen & Verdenduin (1983](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_of_a_circle#CITEREFGerretsenVerdenduin1983), pp.243–250).

### Archimedes' doubling method

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Area_of_a_circle&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Archimedes' doubling method")]

Given a circle, let _u n_ be the [perimeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perimeter "Perimeter") of an inscribed regular _n-_ gon, and let _U n_ be the perimeter of a circumscribed regular _n-_ gon. Then _u n_ and _U n_ are lower and upper bounds for the circumference of the circle that become sharper and sharper as _n_ increases, and their average (_u n_ + _U n_)/2 is an especially good approximation to the circumference. To compute _u n_ and _U n_ for large _n_, Archimedes derived the following doubling formulae:

![Image 60: {\displaystyle u_{2n}={\sqrt {U_{2n}u_{n}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/18d6b0413585820942fe8d0934bf48f02c0a33a4)([geometric mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_mean "Geometric mean")), and![Image 61: {\displaystyle U_{2n}={\frac {2U_{n}u_{n}}{U_{n}+u_{n}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8bde8040dd0b47695d703e8cc93d4cedfd36e77a) ([harmonic mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_mean "Harmonic mean")).
Starting from a hexagon, Archimedes doubled _n_ four times to get a 96-gon, which gave him a good approximation to the circumference of the circle.

In modern notation, we can reproduce his computation (and go further) as follows. For a unit circle, an inscribed hexagon has _u_ 6= 6, and a circumscribed hexagon has _U_ 6= 4√3. Doubling seven times yields

**Archimedes doubling seven times; _n_=6×2 _k_.**| _k_ | _n_ | _u n_ | _U n_ | ⁠_u n_+_U n_/4⁠ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 6 | 6.0000000 | 6.9282032 | 3.2320508 |
| 1 | 12 | 6.2116571 | 6.4307806 | 3.1606094 |
| 2 | 24 | 6.2652572 | 6.3193199 | 3.1461443 |
| 3 | 48 | 6.2787004 | 6.2921724 | 3.1427182 |
| 4 | 96 | 6.2820639 | 6.2854292 | 3.1418733 |
| 5 | 192 | 6.2829049 | 6.2837461 | 3.1416628 |
| 6 | 384 | 6.2831152 | 6.2833255 | 3.1416102 |
| 7 | 768 | 6.2831678 | 6.2832204 | 3.1415970 |

(Here ⁠_u n_ + _U n_/2⁠ approximates the circumference of the unit circle, which is 2 π, so ⁠_u n_ + _U n_/4⁠ approximates π.)

The last entry of the table has 355⁄113 as one of its [best rational approximations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continued_fraction#Best_rational_approximation "Continued fraction"); i.e., there is no better approximation among rational numbers with denominator up to 113. The number 355⁄113 is also an excellent approximation to π, attributed to Chinese mathematician [Zu Chongzhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zu_Chongzhi "Zu Chongzhi"), who named it [Milü](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mil%C3%BC "Milü").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_of_a_circle#cite_note-5) This approximation is better than any other rational number with denominator less than 16,604.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_of_a_circle#cite_note-6)

### The Snell–Huygens refinement

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Area_of_a_circle&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: The Snell–Huygens refinement")]

Snell proposed (and Huygens proved) a tighter bound than Archimedes':

![Image 62: {\displaystyle n{\frac {3\sin {\frac {\pi }{n}}}{2+\cos {\frac {\pi }{n}}}}<\pi <n\left(2\sin {\frac {\pi }{3n}}+\tan {\frac {\pi }{3n}}\right).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/86536f9d37cbcfb29eb6a427d3041661a8310542)
This for _n_ = 48 gives a better approximation (about 3.14159292) than Archimedes' method for _n_ = 768.

### Derivation of Archimedes' doubling formulae

Circle with similar triangles: circumscribed side, inscribed side and complement, inscribed split side and complement

Let one side of an inscribed regular _n-_ gon have length _s n_ and touch the circle at points A and B. Let A′ be the point opposite A on the circle, so that A′A is a diameter, and A′AB is an inscribed triangle on a diameter. By [Thales' theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thales%27_theorem "Thales' theorem"), this is a right triangle with right angle at B. Let the length of A′B be _c n_, which we call the complement of _s n_; thus _c n_ 2+_s n_ 2= (2 _r_)2. Let C bisect the arc from A to B, and let C′ be the point opposite C on the circle. Thus the length of CA is _s_ 2 _n_, the length of C′A is _c_ 2 _n_, and C′CA is itself a right triangle on diameter C′C. Because C bisects the arc from A to B, C′C perpendicularly bisects the chord from A to B, say at P. Triangle C′AP is thus a right triangle, and is [similar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Similarity_(geometry)#Similar_triangles "Similarity (geometry)") to C′CA since they share the angle at C′. Thus all three corresponding sides are in the same proportion; in particular, we have C′A:C′C= C′P:C′A and AP:C′A= CA:C′C. The center of the circle, O, bisects A′A, so we also have triangle OAP similar to A′AB, with OP half the length of A′B. In terms of side lengths, this gives us

![Image 64: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}c_{2n}^{2}&{}=\left(r+{\frac {1}{2}}c_{n}\right)2r\\c_{2n}&{}={\frac {s_{n}}{s_{2n}}}.\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2ec280ac13e1450d5a24fd526952d400b682dfe2)
In the first equation C′P is C′O+OP, length _r_+⁠1/2⁠_c n_, and C′C is the diameter, 2 _r_. For a unit circle we have the famous doubling equation of [Ludolph van Ceulen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludolph_van_Ceulen "Ludolph van Ceulen"),

![Image 65: {\displaystyle c_{2n}={\sqrt {2+c_{n}}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/cef43c0b37b00567ab8546d4d7390549f2a0679e)
If we now circumscribe a regular _n-_ gon, with side A″B″ parallel to AB, then OAB and OA″B″ are similar triangles, with A″B″:AB= OC:OP. Call the circumscribed side _S n_; then this is _S n_:_s n_= 1:1⁄2 _c n_. (We have again used that OP is half the length of A′B.) Thus we obtain

![Image 66: {\displaystyle c_{n}=2{\frac {s_{n}}{S_{n}}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b061aef26814208a0f9fe1ea53fb309ac7b879ef)
Call the inscribed perimeter _u n_= _ns n_, and the circumscribed perimeter _U n_= _nS n_. Then combining equations, we have

![Image 67: {\displaystyle c_{2n}={\frac {s_{n}}{s_{2n}}}=2{\frac {s_{2n}}{S_{2n}}},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/07eb7dfab4dd77c486b80b2ce9bdbdbdc007fbb3)
so that

![Image 68: {\displaystyle u_{2n}^{2}=u_{n}U_{2n}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3b922e528b38ccf8a06fac1703d2b96075b8e7ba)
This gives a [geometric mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_mean "Geometric mean") equation.

We can also deduce

![Image 69: {\displaystyle 2{\frac {s_{2n}}{S_{2n}}}{\frac {s_{n}}{s_{2n}}}=2+2{\frac {s_{n}}{S_{n}}},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8e55724fd390dc5e2926ecf9638f5c5d9fc7be2b)
or

![Image 70: {\displaystyle {\frac {2}{U_{2n}}}={\frac {1}{u_{n}}}+{\frac {1}{U_{n}}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2cbcda2b6cfd07af45818ee1cc270795417fc609)
This gives a [harmonic mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_mean "Harmonic mean") equation.

Unit circle area Monte Carlo integration. Estimate by these 900 samples is 4×⁠709/900⁠= 3.15111...

When more efficient methods of finding areas are not available, we can resort to "throwing darts". This [Monte Carlo method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method "Monte Carlo method") uses the fact that if random samples are taken uniformly scattered across the surface of a square in which a disk resides, the proportion of samples that hit the disk approximates the ratio of the area of the disk to the area of the square. This should be considered a method of last resort for computing the area of a disk (or any shape), as it requires an enormous number of samples to get useful accuracy; an estimate good to 10−_n_ requires about 100 _n_ random samples ([Thijssen 2006](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_of_a_circle#CITEREFThijssen2006), p.273).

Finite rearrangement
--------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Area_of_a_circle&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: Finite rearrangement")]

We have seen that by partitioning the disk into an infinite number of pieces we can reassemble the pieces into a rectangle. A remarkable fact discovered relatively recently ([Laczkovich 1990](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_of_a_circle#CITEREFLaczkovich1990)) is that we can dissect the disk into a large but _finite_ number of pieces and then reassemble the pieces into a square of equal area. This is called [Tarski's circle-squaring problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarski%27s_circle-squaring_problem "Tarski's circle-squaring problem"). The nature of Laczkovich's proof is such that it proves the existence of such a partition (in fact, of many such partitions) but does not exhibit any particular partition.

Non-Euclidean circles
---------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Area_of_a_circle&action=edit&section=20 "Edit section: Non-Euclidean circles")]

Circles can be defined in [non-Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Euclidean_geometry "Non-Euclidean geometry"), and in particular in the [hyperbolic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_plane "Hyperbolic plane") and [elliptic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_plane "Elliptic plane") planes.

For example, the [unit sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_sphere "Unit sphere")![Image 72: {\displaystyle S^{2}(1)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bc4636bdf770b534f693150ebb7fbadfb784487b) is a model for the two-dimensional elliptic plane. It carries an [intrinsic metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrinsic_metric "Intrinsic metric") that arises by measuring [geodesic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic "Geodesic") length. The geodesic circles are the parallels in a [geodesic coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude "Latitude").

More precisely, fix a point ![Image 73: {\displaystyle \mathbf {z} \in S^{2}(1)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3c1b6091f6bf3c3ed153525e1f5225c8e033d8e3) that we place at the zenith. Associated to that zenith is a geodesic polar coordinate system ![Image 74: {\displaystyle (\varphi ,\theta )}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a110fb79b1172f7ed4035655811f0d8d223efb80), ![Image 75: {\displaystyle 0\leq \varphi \leq \pi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fd53d652e90ac4b674bdfd8a764a1f10f831cebf), ![Image 76: {\displaystyle 0\leq \theta <2\pi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/be6186f8c500d093d06941c6508a3ad10570f851), where **z** is the point ![Image 77: {\displaystyle \varphi =0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/192287b02f5764a18fe39f37b8199d72000aa220).

A spherical circle is the set of points a geodesic distance _R_ from the zenith point **z**. Equivalently, with a fixed embedding into ![Image 81: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f936ddf584f8f3dd2a0ed08917001b7a404c10b5), the spherical circle of radius ![Image 82: {\displaystyle R\leq \pi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c173c39db61e8959cc2dd99a37336c4faa0021b2) centered at **z** is the set of **x** in ![Image 83: {\displaystyle S^{2}(1)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bc4636bdf770b534f693150ebb7fbadfb784487b) such that ![Image 84: {\displaystyle \mathbf {x} \cdot \mathbf {z} =\cos R}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5be3f540f11aac9c7169444b99b2fb09cf0974af).

We can also measure the area of the spherical disk enclosed within a spherical circle, using the intrinsic surface area measure on the sphere. The area of the disk of radius _R_ is then given by

![Image 85: {\displaystyle A=\int _{0}^{2\pi }\int _{0}^{R}\sin(\varphi )\,d\varphi \,d\theta =2\pi (1-\cos R).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/dd65f4e910ad34c58c8820c81f8b3c21dc9c25d4)
More generally, if a sphere ![Image 86: {\displaystyle S^{2}(\rho )}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/17dbbacbebb0fc0065e70780ed3ed351823db228) has radius of curvature ![Image 87: {\displaystyle \rho }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1f7d439671d1289b6a816e6af7a304be40608d64), then the area of the disk of radius _R_ is given by

![Image 88: {\displaystyle A=2\pi \rho ^{2}(1-\cos(R/\rho )).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5911dc61f7dbc9eb176f47b8893f8f1d7c371a9a)
Observe that, as an application of [L'Hôpital's rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27H%C3%B4pital%27s_rule "L'Hôpital's rule"), this tends to the Euclidean area ![Image 89: {\displaystyle \pi R^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/db4bdad3187c4001ed7079d18509f3b52d18479c) in the flat limit ![Image 90: {\displaystyle \rho \to \infty }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/330b19cae37f63c358115adb2510a4dc75f00f35).

The hyperbolic case is similar, with the area of a disk of intrinsic radius _R_ in the (constant curvature ![Image 91: {\displaystyle -1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/704fb0427140d054dd267925495e78164fee9aac)) hyperbolic plane given by

![Image 92: {\displaystyle A=2\pi (1-\cosh R)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/04b4cbe978b64a6621d81b2a8d8a47c311af3c16)
where cosh is the [hyperbolic cosine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_cosine "Hyperbolic cosine"). More generally, for the constant curvature ![Image 93: {\displaystyle -k}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/641790be442610fecf0307a8cc06a19adb14ba7e) hyperbolic plane, the answer is

![Image 94: {\displaystyle A=2\pi k^{-2}(1-\cosh(kR)).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/02e14b32b92404532db1e62765c41bb7ecb5605f)
These identities are important for comparison inequalities in geometry. For example, the area enclosed by a circle of radius _R_ in a flat space is always greater than the area of a spherical circle and smaller than a hyperbolic circle, provided all three circles have the same (intrinsic) radius. That is,

![Image 95: {\displaystyle 2\pi (1-\cos R)<\pi R^{2}<2\pi (1-\cosh R)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ae7983b5208abcd07971ca2d97cde9ab09ad6b1c)
for all ![Image 96: {\displaystyle R>0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/57914127d03a5cea02c60a32cfbb22f34904f00d). Intuitively, this is because the sphere tends to curve back on itself, yielding circles of smaller area than those in the plane, whilst the hyperbolic plane, when immersed into space, develops fringes that produce additional area. It is more generally true that the area of the circle of a fixed radius _R_ is a strictly decreasing function of the curvature.

In all cases, if ![Image 97: {\displaystyle k}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c3c9a2c7b599b37105512c5d570edc034056dd40) is the curvature (constant, positive or negative), then the [isoperimetric inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoperimetric_inequality "Isoperimetric inequality") for a domain with area _A_ and perimeter _L_ is

![Image 98: {\displaystyle L^{2}\geq 4\pi A-kA^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2773d6b658e70bfafa898a1eeb404ee35162d500)
where equality is achieved precisely for the circle.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_of_a_circle#cite_note-7)

We can stretch a disk to form an [ellipse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipse "Ellipse"). Because this stretch is a [linear transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_transformation "Linear transformation") of the plane, it has a distortion factor which will change the area but preserve _ratios_ of areas. This observation can be used to compute the area of an arbitrary ellipse from the area of a unit circle.

Consider the unit circle circumscribed by a square of side length 2. The transformation sends the circle to an ellipse by stretching or shrinking the horizontal and vertical diameters to the major and minor axes of the ellipse. The square gets sent to a rectangle circumscribing the ellipse. The ratio of the area of the circle to the square is π/4, which means the ratio of the ellipse to the rectangle is also π/4. Suppose _a_ and _b_ are the lengths of the major and minor axes of the ellipse. Since the area of the rectangle is _ab_, the area of the ellipse is π _ab_/4.

We can also consider analogous measurements in higher dimensions. For example, we may wish to find the volume inside a sphere. When we have a formula for the surface area, we can use the same kind of "onion" approach we used for the disk.
