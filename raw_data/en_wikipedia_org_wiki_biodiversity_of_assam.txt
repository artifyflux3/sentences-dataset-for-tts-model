The greatest success in recent years has been the conservation of the Indian rhinoceros at the Kaziranga National Park , but a rapid increase in human population in Assam threatens many plants and animals and their habitats.

The rhinoceros, tiger, deer or chital / futukihorina ( Axis axis ), swamp deer or dolhorina ( Cervus duvauceli duvauceli ), clouded leopard ( Neofelis nebulosa ), hoolock gibbon , pygmy hog or nol-gahori ( Porcula salvania ), hispid hare , golden langur ( Trachypithecus geei ), golden cat , giant civet , binturong , hog badger , porcupine , and civet are found in Assam. Moreover, there are abundant numbers of Gangetic dolphins , mongooses , giant squirrels and pythons . The largest population of wild water buffalo is in Assam.

[ 1 ] The major birds in Assam include the blue-throated barbet or hetuluka ( Megalaima asiatica ), white-winged wood duck or deuhnah ( Asarcornis scultulata ), Pallas's fish eagle or kuruwa ( Haliaeetus leucoryphus ), great pied hornbill or rajdhonesh ( Buceros bicornis homrai ), Himalayan golden-backed three-toed wood-pecker or barhoituka ( Dinopium shorii shorii ), and migratory pelican.
