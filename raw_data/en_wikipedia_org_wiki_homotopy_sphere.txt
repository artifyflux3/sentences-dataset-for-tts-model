It thus has the same homotopy groups and the same homology groups as the n -sphere, and so every homotopy sphere is necessarily a homology sphere .

[ 1 ] The topological generalized Poincaré conjecture is that any n -dimensional homotopy sphere is homeomorphic to the n -sphere; it was solved by Stephen Smale in dimensions five and higher, by Michael Freedman in dimension 4, and for dimension 3 (the original Poincaré conjecture ) by Grigori Perelman in 2005.

The resolution of the smooth Poincaré conjecture in dimensions 5 and larger implies that homotopy spheres in those dimensions are precisely exotic spheres .  It is open whether non-trivial smooth homotopy spheres exist in dimension 4.

Homotopy spheres form an abelian group known as Kervaire–Milnor group . Its composition is the connected sum and its neutral element is the sphere, while inversion is given by opposite orientation .
