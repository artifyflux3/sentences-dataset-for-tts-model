[ 1 ] [ 2 ] The origin of the term is attributed to fragment B89 ( Diels–Kranz numbering ) of the pre-Socratic philosopher Heraclitus : [ 1 ] [ 2 ] "The waking have one common world, but the sleeping turn aside each into a world of his own." [ 3 ] The term has various interpretations: idios kosmos is associated with dreaming , imagination , and delusion ; koinos kosmos with wakefulness , reason , and consensus reality .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 4 ] From the 1950s, the term was adopted by phenomenological / existential psychologists , such as Ludwig Binswanger and Rollo May , to refer to the experience of people with delusions or other problems who have trouble seeing beyond a limited private world of their own minds or who confuse this private world with shared reality.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] It was an important part of novelist Philip K. Dick 's views on schizophrenia , as expressed in his 1964 essay "Schizophrenia & 'The Book of Changes'", where he drew on his familiarity with the existential psychologists, Heraclitus, and the I Ching .

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] The koinos kosmos is mentioned in the Dick novel Lies Inc.

where the protagonist mentions that he was "able to maintain contact with the stable objective koinos kosmos so that I never forgot that what I was seeing emanated from my own psyche".

Heraclitus, the first Greek who used the word and coined the meaning of philosophia , distinguished the narrow tribal world around man as the idios kosmos , the private and privative order, and contrasted it with the koinos kosmos , the universal order, where man, fully awakened, grows to participate in the universal logos or reason above all narrowness, privacy, and limitations.

Heraclitus had distinguished between the men who live in the one and common world ( koinos kosmos ) of the logos which is the common bond of humanity ( homologia ) and the men who live in the several private worlds ( idios kosmos ) of their passion and imagination, between the men who lead a waking life and the sleepwalkers who take their dreams for reality (B 89) ...

XCV.—Plutarch, de Superst. 3, p. 166. Heraclitus says: To those who are awake, there is one world in common, but of those who are asleep, each is withdrawn to a private world of his own. ... XCV. Plutarchus de Superst. 3, p. 166: ὁ Ἡράκλειτός φησι, τοῖς ἐγρηγορόσιν ἕνα καὶ κοινὸν κόσμον εἶναι, τῶν δὲ κοιμωμένων ἕκαστον εἰς ἴδιον ἀποστρέφεσθαι.

On one hand truth always refers to the 'koinos kosmos' (it is no accident that science lives off the mutual understanding of the researchers) and so the world of delusion appears as 'idios kosmos' in contrast to truth which is common to us. Binswanger has repeatedly marked this point.

Binswanger writes as follows, in his paper on psychotherapy, concerning the significance of the therapist's role of the relationship ... 'the fundamental power that makes any therapy work—the power to liberate a person from the blind isolation, the idios kosmos of Heraclitus, from a mere vegetating in his body, his dreams, his private wishes, his conceit and his presumptions, and to ready him for a life of koinonia , of genuine community.' {{ cite book }} : ISBN / Date incompatibility ( help ) The term idios kosmos is also used elsewhere in the same book by psychiatrist Viktor Emil von Gebsattel [ de ] on page 182 and again by Binswanger on page 273 .

The removal of these obstacles to cognition, to authentic interhuman communication and communion, is an essential feature of the existential group psychotherapeutic endeavor. Man is to be liberated from the prison of his 'idios cosmos' (private world of ideas) and enabled to live in the 'coinos cosmos' (shared word of communing) (Heraclitus). Only here can his essential humanness come to fruition.

Delusions are the replacement of common sense by a very private sense ... Phenomenological and existentialist influenced psychiatry has described how delusional ideas consist of the desire to control one's own world, idios kosmos , or the common world, koinos kosmos [14]. Each one of us is in two worlds at the same time, the one of common reality and one's own in which fantasy, dreams or simple longings and hopes reign. The sane person is able to distinguish one from another, and even to pass from one to another even when doubts about that radical ambiguity of our consciousness assault him or her. In delusions everything is different.
