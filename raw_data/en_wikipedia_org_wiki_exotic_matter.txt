Several particles whose existence has been experimentally confirmed that are conjectured to be exotic hadrons and within the Standard Model .

States of matter that are not commonly encountered, such as Bose–Einstein condensates , fermionic condensates , nuclear matter , quantum spin liquid , string-net liquid , supercritical fluid , color-glass condensate , quark–gluon plasma , Rydberg matter , Rydberg polaron , photonic matter , Wigner crystal , [ 1 ] Superfluid and time crystal but whose properties are entirely within the realm of mainstream physics.

Forms of matter that are poorly understood, such as dark matter and mirror matter .

Ordinary matter that when placed under high pressure , may result in dramatic changes in its physical or chemical properties.

Degenerate matter Exotic atoms Negative mass [ edit ] Main article: Negative mass Negative mass would possess some strange properties, such as accelerating in the direction opposite of applied force . Despite being inconsistent with the expected behavior of "normal" matter, negative mass is mathematically consistent and introduces no violation of conservation of momentum or energy . It is used in certain speculative theories, such as on the construction of artificial wormholes and the Alcubierre drive . The closest known real representative of such exotic matter is the region of pseudo- negative-pressure density produced by the Casimir effect .

Complex mass [ edit ] Main article: Tachyon § Mass A hypothetical particle with complex rest mass would always travel faster than the speed of light . Such particles are called tachyons . There is no confirmed existence of tachyons.

E = m ⋅ ⋅ c 2 1 − − | v | 2 c 2 {\displaystyle E={\frac {m\cdot c^{2}}{\sqrt {1-{\frac {\left|\mathbf {v} \right|^{2}}{c^{2}}}}}}} If the rest mass m {\displaystyle m} is complex this implies that the denominator is complex because the total energy is observable and thus must be real . Therefore, the quantity under the square root must be negative, which can only happen if v is greater than c . As noted by Gregory Benford et al., special relativity implies that tachyons, if they existed, could be used to communicate backwards in time [ 2 ] (see tachyonic antitelephone ). Because time travel is considered to be non-physical, tachyons are believed by physicists either not to exist, or else to be incapable of interacting with normal matter.

In quantum field theory , complex mass would induce tachyon condensation .

Materials at high pressure [ edit ] At high pressure, materials such as sodium chloride (NaCl) in the presence of an excess of either chlorine or sodium were transformed into compounds "forbidden" by classical chemistry, such as Na 3 Cl and NaCl 3 . Quantum mechanical calculations predict the possibility of other compounds, such as NaCl 7 , Na 3 Cl 2 and Na 2 Cl . The materials are thermodynamically stable at high pressures. Such compounds may exist in natural environments that exist at high pressure, such as the deep ocean or inside planetary cores . The materials have potentially useful properties. For instance, Na 3 Cl is a two-dimensional metal, made of layers of pure sodium and salt that can conduct electricity. The salt layers act as insulators while the sodium layers act as conductors.
