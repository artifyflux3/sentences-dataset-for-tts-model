He studied and taught at the Technical University of Munich , and taught internationally as visiting professor. He was co-author of the reference book Introduction to Numerical Analysis , and president of the edition of the works by Johannes Kepler .

[ 3 ] He is the author (with Josef Stoer ) of Introduction to Numerical Analysis , a standard reference for the theory of numerical methods , and has also authored numerous other books and articles. The book From Nano to Space: Applied Mathematics Inspired by Roland Bulirsch is a tribute to his work.

[ 3 ] The Bulirsch–Stoer algorithm is named after him and Stoer.

Bulirsch received honorary doctorates from the University of Hamburg , the Technical University of Liberec, the National Technical University of Athens and the University of Viên Toán Hoc in Hanoi.
