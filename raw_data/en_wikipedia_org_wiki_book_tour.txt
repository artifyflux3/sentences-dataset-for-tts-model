Three objectives of any presentation on a book tour are to entertain the audience, serve the interest of whichever institution is hosting the presentation, and to sell books in person at the presentation.

[ 1 ] Authors have a range of opinions about the effectiveness of book tours.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] Higher profile writers sometimes do tours with an escort to help them manage interaction with the audience during presentations.

[ 4 ] Book tours have become less common since the 2008 Great Recession .
