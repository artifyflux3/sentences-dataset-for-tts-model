The center hosts and organizes academic activities, provides research funds for faculty and students, and helps policy-makers and news media to understand modern China.

[ 1 ] The center sponsors the Edwin O. Reischauer Lectures .

History [ edit ] The center was established in 1955 as the Center for East Asian Research, and on the retirement of its founding director, John K. Fairbank , was renamed the John K. Fairbank Center for East Asian Research. From its beginnings in 1955, its focus was on modern and contemporary China, diverging from classic sinology , which emphasized the study of texts from a humanistic perspective.

[ 1 ] To mark its 60th anniversary, the center hosted a symposium exploring the evolving landscape of Chinese studies and the center’s shifting role within it.
