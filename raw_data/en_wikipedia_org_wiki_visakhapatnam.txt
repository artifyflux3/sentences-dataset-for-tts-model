[ 19 ] It is between the Eastern Ghats and the coast of the Bay of Bengal .

[ 20 ] [ 21 ] It is the second largest city on the east coast of India after Chennai , and the fourth largest in South India . It is one of the four smart cities of Andhra Pradesh selected under the Smart Cities Mission [ 22 ] and is the headquarters of Visakhapatnam district .

[ 23 ] Vizag is popularly known as shipbuilding capital of India due to presence of multiple shipyards such as Hindustan Shipyard , Naval Dockyard and being the central naval command of the east coast.                               As the economic hub of Andhra Pradesh , the city hosts diversified economy with the presence of Heavy industries, Ports, Logistics, Pharmaceuticals, Medtech, Biotechnology, Energy production, Tourism, Textiles, R&D and a growing Information Technology & Financial Technology ecosystem.                                      It is also described as the City of Destiny and the Jewel of the East Coast .

Visakhapatnam's history dates back to the 6th century BCE.

[ 24 ] The city was ruled by the Andhra Satavahanas , Vengi , the Pallava and Eastern Ganga dynasties.

[ 25 ] [ 26 ] Visakhapatnam was an ancient port city which had trade relations with the Middle East and Rome .

[ 27 ] Ships in Visakhapatnam were anchored at open roads and loaded with cargo transported from the shoreside using small masula boats .

[ 28 ] A reference to a Vizagapatnam merchant is available in the inscriptions of Bheemeswara temple (1068 CE) in the East Godavari District .

[ 29 ] During the 12th century CE, Vizagapatnam was a fortified mercantile town managed by a guild.

[ 30 ] European powers eventually established trade operations in the city, and by the end of the 18th century it had come under French colonial rule .

[ 31 ] [ 32 ] Control of the city passed to the East India Company in 1804 and it remained under British colonial rule until Indian independence in 1947 .

[ 32 ] The city is home to some reputed Central and State educational institutions of the state, including Andhra University (AU), Andhra Medical College (AMC), Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Indian Institute of Petroleum and Energy (IIPE), Damodaram Sanjivayya National Law University (DSNLU), Indian Maritime University (IMU), and the National Institute of Oceanography among others. Visakhapatnam serves as the headquarters for the Indian Navy 's Eastern Naval Command .

[ 33 ] The city also serves as the zonal headquarters of South Coast Railway Zone (SCoR). The city is also home to the oldest shipyard and the only natural harbour on the east coast of India.

[ 34 ] Visakhapatnam Port is the fifth-busiest cargo port in India. The city is a major tourist destination and is known for its beaches, ancient Buddhist sites, and the natural environment of the surrounding Eastern Ghats .

[ 35 ] It is nicknamed as the "City of Destiny" and the "Jewel of the East Coast".

[ 23 ] According to the Swachh Survekshan rankings of 2020, it is the ninth cleanest city in India among cities with a population of more than 1 million .

[ 36 ] In 2020, it was a finalist in the Living and Inclusion category of the World Smart City Awards.

[ 37 ] [ 38 ] Etymology The local belief behind the name of the city-states there was a king in the 4th century, who on his pilgrimage halted at Lawson's Bay and built a temple dedicated to Vaisakha , which was submerged under the sea, but the name of the temple became attached to the settlement.

[ 39 ] Other historical names are, Kulotungapatnam , named by the Chola King Kulottunga I ; Ishakapatnam , based on a Muslim Saint, Syed Ali Madani (Ishak Madani).

[ 39 ] [ 40 ] During the East India Company rule in India , the city was known with the name, Vizagapatnam .

[ 41 ] The suburb Waltair is another such name which was derived from the name the British colonial government used.

[ 23 ] "Vizagapatnam" could also be spelled Visakhapatnam in the West European alphabet. The name was popularly shortened to Vizag and this form was in use right from the earliest days of British colonial rule in the district in the late eighteenth century.

[ 42 ] It is still referred to as Vizag by locals too, however since independence , people have reverted to calling it by its Indian name of Visakhapatnam.

[ 39 ] History Main article: History of Visakhapatnam Visakhapatnam's history stretches back to the 6th century BCE and the city finds mention in ancient texts such as the 4th century BCE writings of Pāṇini and Katyayana . Historically considered part of the Kalinga region, [ 31 ] [ 32 ] it was ruled by the Vengi kingdom and the Pallava and Eastern Ganga dynasties during medieval times.

[ 25 ] Archaeological records suggest that the present city was built around the 11th and 12th centuries C.E. by the Chola dynasty king Kulothunga I . Control over the city fluctuated between the Chola dynasty of Tamil Nadu and the Gajapati Kingdom of Odisha [ 31 ] [ 32 ] until its conquest by the Vijayanagara Empire in the 15th century.

[ 25 ] The city was ruled by the Andhra Kings of Vengi and Pallavas. The city is named after Sri Visakha Varma.

[ 43 ] Legend has it that Radha and Viśakha were born on the same day and were equally beautiful. Sri Visakka Sakhi is the second most important gopi of the eight main gopis. She carries messages between Radha and Krishna and is the most expert Gopi messenger. Residents believe that an Andhra king built a temple to pay homage to his family deity Viśakha. This is now inundated under seawater near R K Beach . Another theory is that it is named after a woman disciple of Buddha named Viśakha . Later it was ruled by Kingdom of Jeypore (1535–1571), Qutb Shahis (1571–1674) and (1674–1711), Mughal Empire (1711–1724) and Nizam (1724–1757). The French (1757) and British (1765) established Factories and influence over the city. In 1794 the Battle of Padmanabham occurred between the Zamindari of Vizianagaram and the East India Company.

[ 44 ] after the battle, Vizianagaram estate was acquired by the East India company in 1802.

[ 45 ] The British East India Company fought the 1804 Battle of Vizagapatnam and it remained the under British colonial rule until Indian independence in 1947 which was a part of the Northern Circars .

Buddhist influence Hindu texts state that during the fifth century BCE, the Visakhapatnam region was part of Kalinga territory, which extended to the Godavari river . Relics found in the area also prove the existence of a Buddhist empire in the region. Kalinga later lost the territory to King Ashoka in the bloodiest battle of its time, which prompted Ashoka to embrace Buddhism . Ancient Buddhist sites, recently excavated, are scattered across Visakhapatnam, reflecting the region's Buddhist legacy.

[ 46 ] Pavurallakonda Yaksha Relief at Pavurallakonda near Bheemunipatnam Pavurallakonda ("pigeon hill") is a hillock west of Bhimli, about 24 km (15 mi) from Visakhapatnam. The Buddhist settlement found here is estimated to date back from the first century BCE to the second century CE. On the hillock (which overlooks the coastline) are 16 rock-cut cisterns for collecting rainwater.

Gopalapatnam , on the Tandava River, is a village surrounded by brick stupas, viharas , pottery and other Buddhist artefacts.

[ 47 ] Sankaram Stone seated Buddha at Bojjannakonda near Anakapalle In 1907 British archaeologist Alexander Rea unearthed Sankaram, a 2,000-year-old Buddhist site. The name "Śankaram" derives from the Sangharama (temple or monastery). Located 40 km (25 mi) south of Visakhapatnam, it is known locally as Bojjannakonda and is a significant Buddhist site in Andhra Pradesh. The three major schools of Buddhism (Hinayana, Mahayana and Vajrayana) flourished here. The complex is known for its monolithic stupas , rock-cut caves and brick structures. The primary stupa was initially carved out of rock and covered with bricks. Excavations yielded historic pottery and Satavahana coins from the first century CE. At Lingalakonda, there are also rock-cut monolithic stupas in rows spread over the hill.

[ 48 ] The vihara, a monastery, was active for about 1,000 years.

[ 48 ] Nearby is another Buddhist site, Bojjannakonda, with several images of the Buddha carved on the rock face of the caves. At Ligalametta there are hundreds of rock-cut monolithic stupas in rows, spread across the hill. Among other Buddhist attractions are a relic casket, three chaitya halls, votive platforms, stupas and Vajrayana sculptures.

[ 49 ] Bavikonda Bavikonda stupas Bavikonda is an important Buddhist heritage site located on a hill about 15 km (9.3 mi), northeast of Visakhapatnam city. Here the Buddhist habitation is noticed on a 16 ha flat terraced area. The Hinayana school of Buddhism was practised at the monastery between the 3rd century B.C. and the 3rd century A.D. Bavikonda has remains of an entire Buddhist complex, comprising 26 structures belonging to three phases. A piece of bone stored in an urn recovered here is believed to belong to the mortal remains of the Buddha . The word Bavikonda in Telugu means "a hill of wells". Fitting its name, Bavikonda is a hill with wells for the collection of rainwater. It is located 15 km (9.3 mi) from Visakhapatnam and is a significant Buddhist site.

Excavation carried out from 1982 to 1987 revealed a Buddhist establishment including a mahachaitya, also referred to as a grand stupa, embedded with relic caskets, [ 50 ] a large Vihara (monastery) complex, numerous votive stupas, a stone-pillared congregation and rectangular halls and a refectory. Artifacts recovered from the site include Roman and Satavahana coins and pottery dating from the third century BCE to the second century CE. A significant finding was a piece of bone (with a large quantity of ash) in an urn, which is believed to be the remains of the Buddha . The Bavikonda site is considered one of the oldest Buddhist sites in Asia. It is a reminder of the Buddhist civilisation which once existed in southern India, and also reminiscent of Borobudur in Indonesia.

[ 51 ] Thotlakonda Third-century BCE Buddhist ruins of Totlakonda Thotlakonda Buddhist Complex About 16 km (9.9 mi) from Visakhapatnam is Thotlakonda , a Buddhist complex situated on top of a hill. The Buddhist complex on the Mangamaripeta hilltop, locally known as Totlakonda , lies about 16 km (9.9 mi) from Visakhapatnam on Visakhapatnam-Bheemili Beach Road. After its discovery (during an aerial survey), the Government of Andhra Pradesh declared the 48 ha site as a protected monument in 1978. Excavations from 1988 to 1992 exposed structural remains and artefacts, classified as Religious, Secular, and Civil. These structures include the Stupa, Chaityagrihas, pillared congregation halls, bhandagaras, refectory (bhojanasala), drainage, and stone pathways. The site covers an area of 120 acres (49 hectares), and has been declared a protected area by the government of Andhra Pradesh. Excavations have revealed three kinds of structural remains: religious, secular, and civil. Structures include a mahastupa, 16 votive stupas , a stone-pillared congregation hall, eleven rock-cut cisterns, well-paved stone pathways, an apsidal chaitya -griha, three round chaitgya-grihas, two votive platforms, ten viharas and a kitchen complex with three halls and a refectory (dining hall). Apart from the structures, Buddhist treasures excavated include nine Satavahana and five Roman silver coins, terracotta tiles, stucco decorative pieces, sculptured panels, miniature stupa models in stone, Buddha padas depicted with ashtamangala symbols (i.e. the eight auspicious symbols of Swastika, Shrivasta, Nandhyavarta, Vardhamanaka, Bhadrasana, Kalasha, Minyugala and Darpan) and early pottery.

[ 52 ] Later history Mor Sjanua Regimental Cemetery near Jagadamba junction The territory of Visakhapatnam then came under the Andhra rulers of Vengi , and Chalukyas and Pallavas ruled the land. The region was ruled by the Eastern Ganga king and the Gajapati kings from the 10th century to the 16th century CE. Based on archaeological evidence, the Prabhakar and the Eastern Ganga Kings built temples in the city in the 11th and 12th centuries. In the late 16th century, it came under the direct rule of the Suryavanshi king, Maharaja Vishwanath Dev Gajapati of Jeypore . However, from 1571 to 1674 it fell under the control and administration of the Qutb Shahi kings of Golconda who appointed a governor or Faujdar to collect taxes in the region. This Faujdar governed the area from Srikakulam or Chicacole as it was then known. In 1674, the Maharaja of Jeypore, Vishwambhar Dev defeated the Foujdar and claimed sovereignty from the deteriorating Qutb Shahis.

[ 53 ] Vishwambhar is also said to have defeated the Dutch East India Company who allegedly abducted locals, mostly fishermen living by the sea-shore. Later his descendant, Maharaja Raghunath Krishna Dev defeated the Seer Lascer appointed by the Mughals and maintained his rule over the region. Therefore, Visakhapatnam remained a part of the Kingdom of Jeypore until the death of Maharaja Ram Chandra Dev I in 1711 after which it was taken over by the Nizam of Hyderabad who could only govern it for a few decades before transferring it to the British.

[ 54 ] Even in the colonial era, the kings of Jeypore were referred to as the Maharaja or Raja of Vizagapatnam.

[ 55 ] European merchants from France, Holland and the East India Company used the natural port to export tobacco, paddy , coal, iron ore, ivory, muslin and other textile products. The British developed Visakhapatnam as a prominent harbour on the east coast. The old port in Jalari Peta was built and used by the Maharaja of Jeypore who also owned several ships. During the First World War , Maharaja Vikram Dev III sent his fleet of ships to aid the British and later donated the port to the British government of Madras.

[ 53 ] It is now a fish market.

Local legend tells that an Andhra king, on his way to Benares , rested at Visakhapatnam and was so enchanted by its beauty that he ordered a temple to be built in honour of his family deity, Viśakha. Archaeological sources, however, reveal that the temple was probably built between the 11th and 12th centuries by the Cholas. A shipping merchant, Sankarayya Chetty, built one of the mandapams (pillared halls) of the temple. Although it no longer exists (possibly washed away about 100 years ago by a cyclonic storm), elderly residents of Visakhapatnam remember visits to the ancient shrine by their grandparents (although author Ganapatiraju Atchuta Rama Raju denies this).

[ 56 ] During the 18th century Visakhapatnam was part of the Northern Circars , a region comprising coastal Andhra and southern coastal Odisha which was first under French control and later British. Visakhapatnam became a district in the Madras Presidency of British India . In September 1804, British and French squadrons fought the Battle of Vizagapatam near the harbour. After India's independence, it was the largest district in the country and was subsequently divided into the districts of Srikakulam , Vizianagaram and Visakhapatnam.

Part of the city is known by its colonial British name, Waltair; during the colonial era, the city's hub was the Waltair railway station and a part of the city is still called Waltair.

On 7 May 2020, the city suffered an industrial accident when a polymer plant leaked toxic styrene gas, as it restarted operations after the Coronavirus lockdown . This gas leak killed at least eleven people, and drew comparisons to the Bhopal disaster .

[ 57 ] Geography Kondakarla Ava , a bird sanctuary near Visakhapatnam The city is situated between the Eastern Ghats and the Bay of Bengal .

[ 20 ] The city coordinates lies between 17.7041 N and 83.2977 E.

[ 14 ] [ 15 ] The city's area is 682 km 2 . The average elevation is 45 metres.

[ 58 ] Visakhpatnam is situated in Coastal Andhra Region.

[ 59 ] The city is surrounded by the Simhachalam Hill Range to the west, the Yarada Hills to the southeast, and Kambalakonda Wildlife Sanctuary to the northwest. The hills play an important role in Visakhapatnam's ecological environment and cover over 621.52  km 2 .
