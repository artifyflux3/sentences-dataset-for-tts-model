Reception [ edit ] Paul Thagard , writing in Science for the People , describes the book as "intelligible and entertaining," [ 2 ] while Henry McDonald, writing in The Washington Post , describes it as "well illustrated and thoroughly researched." [ 3 ] "Almost half the book," according to Nan Conklin, writing in Leonardo , "is devoted to recounting Einstein's early life and the influences on him." [ 1 ] "Its discussion of the political environment in which Einstein's discoveries were made is," according to McDonald, "informative." [ 3 ] "The drawing and the words have a distinctly comic-book flavor," according to Conklin, but it is  "only when the authors set out to explain Einstein's theories that the use of the peculiar mode of presentation seems justified." [ 1 ] McDonald says that "the presentation of the discoveries themselves is little short of inspired," [ 3 ] while Thagard too commends the authors as "highly inventive in using amusing illustrations and humorous asides to lead the beginners through difficult concepts." [ 2 ] While Conklin speculates that the publishers may have included a volume on Einstein in this series due to his belief in "the establishment of a socialist economy, accompanied by an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals," [ 1 ] and McDonald confirms that the authors "go out of their way to emphasize [...] Einstein's socialism," Thagard is critical of the failure to "develop the social connections in a substantial way," and concludes that the volume does not provide a "basis for discussion of the role of science in society."
