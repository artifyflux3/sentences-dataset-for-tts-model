Like the concepts of meagre and measure zero sets, a porous set can be considered "sparse" or "lacking bulk"; however, porous sets are not equivalent to either meagre sets or measure zero sets, as shown below.

Definition [ edit ] Let ( X , d ) be a complete metric space and let E be a subset of X . Let B ( x , r ) denote the closed ball in ( X , d ) with centre x ∈ X and radius r > 0.

E is said to be porous if there exist constants 0 < α < 1 and r 0 > 0 such that, for every 0 < r ≤ r 0 and every x ∈ X , there is some point y ∈ X with B ( y , α α r ) ⊆ ⊆ B ( x , r ) ∖ ∖ E .

{\displaystyle B(y,\alpha r)\subseteq B(x,r)\setminus E.} A subset of X is called σ -porous if it is a countable union of porous subsets of X .

Properties [ edit ] Any porous set is nowhere dense . Hence, all σ -porous sets are meagre sets (or of the first category ).

If X is a finite-dimensional Euclidean space R n , then porous subsets are sets of Lebesgue measure zero .

However, there does exist a non- σ -porous subset P of R n which is of the first category and of Lebesgue measure zero. This is known as Zajíček's theorem .

The relationship between porosity and being nowhere dense can be illustrated as follows: if E is nowhere dense, then for x ∈ X and r > 0, there is a point y ∈ X and s > 0 such that B ( y , s ) ⊆ ⊆ B ( x , r ) ∖ ∖ E .

{\displaystyle B(y,s)\subseteq B(x,r)\setminus E.} However, if E is also porous, then it is possible to take s = αr (at least for small enough r ), where 0 < α < 1 is a constant that depends only on E .
