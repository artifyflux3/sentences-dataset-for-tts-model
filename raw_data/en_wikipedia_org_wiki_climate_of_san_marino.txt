Located on the northeastern slopes of the Apennine Mountains , it is the larger of two microstates within Italy, the other being Vatican City .

[ 12 ] San Marino is the fifth-smallest country in the world , [ 13 ] with a land area of just over 61 km 2 ( 23 + 1 ⁄ 2 sq mi) and a population of 34,042 as of 2025.

[ 14 ] Its capital, the City of San Marino , sits atop Monte Titano , while its largest settlement is Dogana , in the municipality of Serravalle .

Founded in 301 AD, San Marino claims to be the oldest extant sovereign state and the oldest constitutional republic .

[ 15 ] It is named after Saint Marinus , a stonemason from the Roman island of Rab (in present-day Croatia ), who is supposed to have established a monastic community on Monte Titano. The country has a rare constitutional structure : the Grand and General Council , a democratically elected legislature, selects two heads of state, the Captains Regent , every six months. They are chosen from opposing political parties, and serve concurrently with equal powers and preside over several institutions of state, including the Grand and General Council. Only the Federal Council of Switzerland also follows that structure, except with seven heads of state.

San Marino is a member of the Council of Europe and uses the euro as its official currency, but is not part of the European Union . The official language is Italian . Its economy is based on finance, industry, services, retail, and tourism, and it ranks among the wealthiest countries in the world by GDP (PPP) per capita .

[ 6 ] San Marino was also the first existing state to abolish the death penalty [ 16 ] and currently ranks 43rd on the Human Development Index .

[ 17 ] History [ edit ] Main article: History of San Marino Illustration of Saint Marinus, the founder of the Republic of San Marino and prominent cultural figure According to accounts that were first recorded centuries after he is suggested to have lived, [ 18 ] Saint Marinus left the island of Rab in present-day Croatia with his lifelong friend Leo, and went to the city of Rimini as a stonemason. After the Diocletianic Persecution following his Christian sermons, he escaped to the nearby Monte Titano , where he built a small church and thus founded what is now the city and state of San Marino.

In 1291, San Marino appealed to the bishop of Arezzo, Ildebrandino Guidi di Romena, against the contribution demands by the Vicario del Montefeltro . Jurist Palamede di Rimini decided in favour of San Marino and recognised its tax exemption from tributes demands of Montefeltro. In 1296, when Guglielmo Durante was the governor of Romagna, Sammarinesi appealed to Pope Boniface VIII against the further requests by the Montefeltro podestas regarding tributes. Abbot Ranieri di Sant'Anastasio was assigned to judge the dispute. A long process was held using various witnesses and sources to determine San Marino tax's exemption status. The verdict was probably in favour of the autonomy of San Marino, as later the State did not pay taxes to the Montefeltro.

[ 19 ] In 1320, the community of Chiesanuova chose to join the country.

[ 20 ] In 1463, San Marino was enlarged by the inclusion of the communities of Faetano , Fiorentino , Montegiardino , and Serravalle ; since then, the country's borders have remained unchanged.

[ 21 ] In 1503, Cesare Borgia , the son of Pope Alexander VI , occupied the Republic for six months until his father's successor, Pope Julius II , intervened and restored the country's independence.

[ 22 ] On 4 June 1543, Fabiano di Monte San Savino, nephew of the later Pope Julius III , attempted to conquer the republic, but his infantry and cavalry failed as they got lost in a dense fog, which the Sammarinesi attributed to Saint Quirinus , whose feast day it was.

[ 23 ] After the Duchy of Urbino was annexed by the Papal States in 1625, San Marino became surrounded by the papal states. This led to its seeking the formal protection of the Papal States in 1631, but this never amounted to a de facto Papal control of the republic.

[ 24 ] The country was occupied on 17 October 1739 by the legate (Papal governor) of Ravenna , Cardinal Giulio Alberoni , but independence was restored by Pope Clement XII on 5 February 1740, the feast day of Saint Agatha , after which she became a patron saint of the republic.

[ 25 ] The advance of Napoleon 's army in 1797 presented a brief threat to the independence of San Marino, but the country was saved from losing its liberty by one of its regents, Antonio Onofri , who managed to gain the respect and friendship of Napoleon. Due to Onofri's intervention, Napoleon promised, in a letter to Gaspard Monge , scientist and commissary of the French Government for Science and Art, to guarantee and protect the independence of the Republic, even offering to extend its territory according to its needs. The offer was declined by the regents, fearing future retaliation from other states' revanchism .

[ 26 ] [ 27 ] Anita and Giuseppe Garibaldi in San Marino, 1849 The San Marino constitution, or more precisely statutes, of 1600 During the later phase of the Italian unification process in the 19th century, San Marino served as a refuge for many people persecuted because of their support for unification, including Giuseppe Garibaldi and his wife Anita . Garibaldi allowed San Marino to remain independent. San Marino and the Kingdom of Italy signed a Convention of Friendship in 1862.

[ 28 ] The government of San Marino made United States President Abraham Lincoln an honorary citizen. He wrote in reply, saying that the republic proved that "government founded on republican principles is capable of being so administered as to be secure and enduring".

[ 29 ] [ 30 ] 20th century onwards [ edit ] During World War I , when Italy declared war on Austria-Hungary on 24 May 1915, San Marino remained neutral and Italy adopted a hostile view of Sammarinese neutrality, suspecting that San Marino could harbour Austrian spies who could be given access to its new radiotelegraph station. Italy tried to forcibly establish a detachment of Carabinieri in the republic and then cut the republic's telephone lines when it did not acquiesce. Two groups of ten volunteers joined the Italian forces in the fighting on the Italian front , the first as combatants and the second as a medical corps operating a Red Cross field hospital. The existence of this hospital later caused Austria-Hungary to suspend diplomatic relations with San Marino.

[ 31 ] After the war, San Marino suffered from high rates of unemployment and inflation, leading to increased tension between the lower and middle classes. The latter, fearing that the moderate government of San Marino would make concessions to the lower class majority, began to show support for the Sammarinese Fascist Party ( Partito Fascista Sammarinese , PFS), founded in 1922 and styled largely on their Italian counterpart . PFS rule lasted from 1923 to 1943, and during this time they often sought support from Benito Mussolini 's fascist government in Italy.

[ 32 ] During World War II , San Marino remained neutral, although it was wrongly reported in an article in The New York Times that it had declared war on the United Kingdom on 17 September 1940.

[ 33 ] The Sammarinese government later transmitted a message to the British government stating that they had not actually declared war.

[ 34 ] British troops at Monte Titano during the Battle of San Marino, September 1944 On 28 July 1943, three days after the fall of the Fascist regime in Italy , PFS rule collapsed and the new government declared neutrality in the conflict. The PFS regained power on 1 April 1944, but kept neutrality intact. On 26 June 1944, the bombing of San Marino happened. The country was bombed by four waves of Allied bombers under the incorrect belief that San Marino had been occupied by German forces and was being used to amass stores and ammunition. The Sammarinese government declared on the same day that no military installations or equipment were located on its territory, and that no belligerent forces had been allowed to enter.

[ 35 ] Nevertheless, smaller bombing raids continued until the 29th of August of that year, causing extensive damage to the city centre as well as the railway line connecting the country to nearby Rimini. San Marino accepted thousands of civilian refugees when Allied forces overran the Gothic Line .

[ 36 ] In September 1944, it was briefly occupied by German forces, who were defeated by the Allies in the Battle of San Marino . Allied troops occupied San Marino for two months before departing.

[ 37 ] San Marino had the world's first democratically elected communist government – a coalition between the Sammarinese Communist Party and the Sammarinese Socialist Party , which held office between 1945 and 1957.

[ 38 ] [ 39 ] The coalition lost power through the fatti di Rovereta . San Marino became a member of the Council of Europe in 1988 and of the United Nations in 1992. It is not a member of the European Union , although it uses the euro as its currency (despite not legally being part of the Eurozone ). Before the introduction of the euro, the country's currency was the Sammarinese lira .

Geography [ edit ] Main article: Geography of San Marino The fortress of Guaita on Monte Titano, a UNESCO recognized World Heritage Site.

[ 40 ] San Marino is an enclave surrounded by Italy in Southern Europe , almost entirely bordered by the province of Rimini in the Emilia Romagna region . Only a stretch of about three kilometres in the south is bordered by the province of Pesaro and Urbino in the Marche region. Located approximately ten kilometres (six miles) from the Adriatic coast near Rimini, San Marino features hilly terrain with little naturally flat ground, as part of the Apennine mountain range. The highest point in the country, the summit of Monte Titano , reaches 749 m (2,457 ft) above sea level , while the lowest point, the Ausa River (which flows into the Marecchia ), [ 41 ] is at 55 m (180 ft). San Marino has no significant still or contained bodies of water .

It is one of only three countries in the world to be completely surrounded by one other country. It is the third-smallest country in Europe, after Vatican City and Monaco and the fifth-smallest country in the world.

[ 13 ] The terrestrial ecoregion of Italian sclerophyllous and semi-deciduous forests lies within San Marino's territory.

[ 42 ] The country had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 0.01/10, ranking it last globally out of 172 countries.

[ 43 ] Enlargeable, detailed map of San Marino Climate [ edit ] San Marino has a humid subtropical climate ( Köppen climate classification : Cfa ), with some continental influences. It has warm to hot summers and cool winters, typical of inland areas of the central Italian Peninsula . Precipitation is scattered throughout the year with no real dry month. Snowfalls are common and heavy almost every winter, especially above 400–500 m (1,300–1,600 feet) of elevation.

Executive power is exercised by the government. Although there is no formal head of government, the secretary for foreign and political affairs is in many ways equal to the prime minister in other countries.

[ 46 ] Legislative power is vested in both the government and the Grand and General Council . The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature.

San Marino is considered to have the earliest written governing documents still in effect, as the Statutes of 1600 are still at the core of its constitutional framework.

[ 47 ] San Marino was originally led by the Arengo , initially formed from the heads of each family. In the 13th century, power was given to the Grand and General Council. In 1243, the first two captains regent were nominated by the council. Still today, Captains Regent are elected every six months by the council.

The legislature of the republic is the Grand and General Council ( Consiglio grande e generale ). The council is a unicameral legislature with 60 members. There are elections every five years by proportional representation in all nine administrative districts. These districts (townships) correspond to the old parishes of the republic. All citizens 18 years or older are eligible to vote.

Besides general legislation, the Grand and General Council approves the budget and elects the captains regent, the State Congress (composed of ten secretaries with executive power), the Council of Twelve (which forms the judicial branch during the period of legislature of the council), the Advising Commissions, and the Government Unions. The council also has the power to ratify treaties with other countries. The council is divided into five different Advising Commissions consisting of fifteen councilors who examine, propose, and discuss the implementation of new laws that are on their way to being presented on the floor of the council.

Every six months, the council elects two captains regent to be the heads of state. The captains are chosen from opposing parties so that there is a balance of power. They serve a six-month term. The investiture of the captains regent takes place on 1 April and 1 October in every year. Once this term is over, citizens have three days in which to file complaints about the captains' activities. If they warrant it, judicial proceedings against the ex-head(s) of state can be initiated.

The practice of having two heads of state chosen in frequent elections is derived directly from the customs of the Roman Republic . The council is equivalent to the Roman Senate ; the captains regent, to the consuls of ancient Rome . It is thought the inhabitants of the area came together as Roman rule collapsed to form a rudimentary government for their own protection from foreign rule.

San Marino is a multi-party democratic republic. A new election law in 2008 raised the threshold for small parties entering Parliament, causing political parties to organise themselves into two alliances: the right-wing Pact for San Marino , led by the Sammarinese Christian Democratic Party ; and the left-wing Reforms and Freedom , led by the Party of Socialists and Democrats , a merger of the Socialist Party of San Marino and the former communist Party of Democrats . The 2008 general election was won by the Pact for San Marino with 35 seats in the Grand and General Council against the Reforms and Freedom party's 25.

On 1 October 2007, Mirko Tomassoni was elected as captain regent, making him the first disabled person elected to that office.

[ 48 ] San Marino has had more female heads of state than any other country: 15 as of October 2014, including three who served twice.

On 1 April 2022, 58-year-old Paolo Rondelli was elected as one of the two captains regent. He had previously been the Ambassador to the United States and is the world's first openly gay head of state.

[ 49 ] Administrative divisions [ edit ] Main articles: Castelli of San Marino and List of curazie in San Marino Castelli of San Marino San Marino is geographically divided into nine castelli ( lit.

' castles ' , equivalent to a municipality ), [ 50 ] each of which contains a capital ( capoluogo ), with other population centres sorted into curazie (equivalent to Italian frazioni ). Each castello is led by a Castle Captain ( Italian : Capitano di Castello ) and a Castle Council ( Giunta di Castello ), elected every five years.

[ 51 ] The nine castelli are the City of San Marino , which is San Marino's capital city, Acquaviva , Borgo Maggiore , Chiesanuova , Domagnano , Faetano , Fiorentino , Montegiardino , and Serravalle .

[ 50 ] San Marino's 44 curazie are Cà Berlone , Cà Chiavello , Cà Giannino , Cà Melone , Cà Ragni , Cà Rigo , Cailungo (di Sopra and di Sotto), Caladino , Calligaria , Canepa , Capanne , Casole , Castellaro , Cerbaiola , Cinque Vie , Confine , Corianino , Crociale , Dogana , Falciano , Fiorina , Galavotto , Gualdicciolo , La Serra , Lesignano , Molarini , Montalbo , Monte Pulito , Murata , Pianacci , Piandivello , Poggio Casalino , Poggio Chiesanuova , Ponte Mellini , Rovereta , San Giovanni sotto le Penne , Santa Mustiola , Spaccio Giannoni , Teglio , Torraccia , Valdragone (di Sopra and di Sotto), Valgiurata , and Ventoso .

[ 50 ] Military [ edit ] Main article: Sammarinese Armed Forces San Marino's military forces are among the smallest in the world. National defence is, by arrangement, the responsibility of Italy's armed forces . Different branches have varied functions, including performing ceremonial duties, patrolling borders, mounting guard at government buildings, and assisting police in major criminal cases. The police are not included in the military of San Marino.

Crossbow Corps [ edit ] Once at the heart of San Marino's army, the Crossbow Corps is now a ceremonial force of approximately 80 volunteers. Since 1295, the Crossbow Corps has provided demonstrations of crossbow shooting at festivals. Its uniform design is medieval. While still a statutory military unit, the Crossbow Corps has no military function today.

Guard of the Rock [ edit ] Guards of the Rock The Guard of the Rock is a front-line military unit in the San Marino armed forces, a state border patrol, with responsibility for patrolling borders and defending them.

[ 52 ] In their role as Fortress Guards they are responsible for guarding the Palazzo Pubblico in San Marino City , the seat of national government.

In this role they are the forces most visible to tourists and are known for their colourful ceremony of Changing the Guard .

[ 52 ] Under the 1987 statute the Guard of the Rock are all enrolled as "Criminal Police Officers" (in addition to their military role) and assist the police in investigating major crime. The uniform of the Guard of the Rock is a distinctive red and green.

[ 52 ] Guard of the Grand and General Council [ edit ] The Guard of the Grand and General Council commonly known as The Guard of the council or locally as the "Guard of Nobles", formed in 1741, [ 52 ] is a volunteer unit with ceremonial duties. Due to its striking blue, white, and gold uniform, it is perhaps the best-known part of the Sammarinese military, and appears on countless postcard views of the republic. The functions of the Guard of the council are to protect the captains regent , and to defend the Grand and General Council during its formal sessions. They also act as ceremonial bodyguards to government officials at both state and church festivals.

Company of Uniformed Militia [ edit ] In former times, all families with two or more adult male members were required to enroll half of them in the Company of Uniformed Militia. This unit remains the basic fighting force of the armed forces of San Marino, but is largely ceremonial. It is a matter of civic pride for many Sammarinese to belong to the force, and all citizens with at least six years' residence in the republic are entitled to enroll.

[ citation needed ] The uniform is dark blue, with a kepi bearing a blue and white plume. The ceremonial form of the uniform includes a white cross-strap, and white and blue sash, white epaulets, and white decorated cuffs.

Military Ensemble [ edit ] Formally this is part of the Army Militia, [ 52 ] and is the ceremonial military band of San Marino. It consists of approximately 60 musicians.

[ 53 ] The uniform is similar to that of the Army Militia. Military Ensemble music accompanies most state occasions in the republic.

Gendarmerie [ edit ] Established in 1842, the Gendarmerie of San Marino is a militarised law enforcement agency.

[ 52 ] Its members are full-time and have responsibility for the protection of citizens and property, and the preservation of law and order.

The entire military corps of San Marino depends upon the co-operation of full-time forces and their retained (volunteer) colleagues, known as the Corpi Militari Volontari , or Voluntary Military Force.

LGBTQ+ rights [ edit ] These paragraphs are an excerpt from LGBTQ rights in San Marino .

[ edit ] Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people in San Marino may face legal challenges not experienced by non- LGBTQ residents. Both male and female same-sex sexual activity are legal in San Marino, but households headed by same-sex couples are not eligible for the same legal protections available to opposite-sex couples.

Discrimination on account of sexual orientation is banned under the 2019 amendments to the Constitution of San Marino . In November 2018, the Grand and General Council approved a bill to legalise civil unions . The law, which took effect on 5 December 2018 and became fully operational on 11 February 2019, following a number of further legal and administrative changes, allows same-sex and opposite-sex couples to enter into a union and receive some of the rights and benefits of marriage.

Economy [ edit ] Main articles: Economy of San Marino , Sammarinese euro coins , Postage stamps and postal history of San Marino , and List of banks in San Marino Tourism and banking are the country's main sources of revenue.

San Marino is a developed country , [ 54 ] and although it is not a European Union member it is allowed to use the euro as its currency by arrangement with the Council of the European Union ; it is also granted the right to use its own designs on the national side of the euro coins . Before the euro, the Sammarinese lira was pegged to, and exchangeable with, the Italian lira . The small number of Sammarinese euro coins , as was the case with the lira before it, are primarily of interest to coin collectors .

San Marino's GDP per capita and standard of living are comparable to that of Italy. Key industries include banking , electronics , and ceramics .

[ citation needed ] The main agricultural products are wine and cheese. San Marino imports staple goods, mainly from Italy.

[ citation needed ] San Marino's postage stamps , which are valid for mail posted in the country, are mostly sold to philatelists and are a significant source of income.

[ 55 ] San Marino is no longer a member of the Small European Postal Administration Cooperation .

[ 56 ] It has the world's third highest rate of car ownership, being one of only a handful of countries with more vehicles than people .

[ 57 ] As of October 3, 2023, Gibraltar had the highest rate of car ownership per capita, and Guernsey was in the number two spot.

[ 58 ] Taxation [ edit ] San Marino offers a competitive tax environment designed to attract investment and support economic development. The standard corporate income tax (Imposta Generale sui Redditi, IGR) rate is 17%. However, new businesses benefit from a reduced rate of 8.5% for the first five years of operation, provided they meet specific employment criteria, such as hiring at least one employee within six months and a second within 24 months of starting operations.

[ 59 ] [ 60 ] [ 61 ] [ 62 ] Innovative startups participating in San Marino's innovation programmes are eligible for further tax incentives: [ 63 ] 0% corporate tax for the first three years.

[ 63 ] 4% for the subsequent four years.

[ 60 ] 8% for the following five years.

[ 60 ] Income tax [ edit ] San Marino employs a progressive personal income tax system, with rates ranging from 9% to 35%: 9% for income up to €10,000.

13% for income between €10,001 and €25,000.

35% for income above €25,000.

[ 64 ] The personal income tax was introduced in 1984 and underwent significant reforms in 2013 to enhance fiscal revenue. San Marino imposes withholding taxes on various forms of income: 5% on dividends paid to individuals.

[ 64 ] 13% on interest payments.

20% on royalties paid to non-residents.

[ 65 ] [ 64 ] Import tax [ edit ] San Marino does not implement a traditional value-added tax (VAT) system. Instead, it applies a single-stage import tax known as "imposta monofase," levied at a standard rate of 17% on the importation cost of goods. This tax is applied only once at the point of importation and does not extend to services. Under the customs union agreement with the European Union, this import tax is considered equivalent to the EU's VAT system.

[ 66 ] Tax incentives [ edit ] To encourage investment, San Marino offers several tax incentives: Dividends received by non-resident companies are 95% exempt from taxation, provided the participation has been held continuously for at least twelve months.

Investments in capital goods or real estate can lead to a reduction in taxable income by up to 90%.

[ 63 ] Because San Marino's tax rate is lower than surrounding Italy 's, many businesses choose to be based in San Marino to avoid the higher rates. San Marino boasts a corporate rate 14.5% lower than Italy (23%) and 12.5% lower than the EU average (21.3%). This has made San Marino the tax haven of choice for many wealthy Italians and businesses.

[ 67 ] [ 68 ] Tourism [ edit ] Main article: Tourism in San Marino The tourism sector contributes over 22% of San Marino's GDP , [ 69 ] with approximately 2 million tourists having visited in 2014.

[ 70 ] On average tourists spend about 2 nights in the republic [ 71 ] making on average a tourist present per 3 residents at any given time.

[ citation needed ] Conventions with Italy [ edit ] San Marino and Italy have engaged in conventions since 1862, [ 72 ] dictating some economic activities in San Marino's territory.

Cultivation of tobacco and production of goods which are subject to Italy's government monopoly are forbidden in San Marino. Direct import is forbidden; all goods coming from a third party have to travel through Italy before reaching the country. Although it is allowed to print its own postal stamps, San Marino is not allowed to coin its own currency and is obliged to use Italy's mint ; the agreement does not affect the right of the Republic of San Marino to continue to issue gold coins denominated in Scudi [ 73 ] (the legal value of 1 gold Scudo is 37.50 euros). Gambling is legal and regulated; however, casinos were outlawed prior to 2007. There is one legally operating casino.

[ citation needed ] In exchange for these limitations, Italy provides San Marino with an annual stipend, provided at cost, of sea salt (not more than 250 tonnes per year), tobacco (40 tonnes), cigarettes (20 tonnes) and matches (unlimited number).

[ 74 ] At the border there are no formalities with Italy. However, at the tourist office visitors can purchase officially cancelled souvenir stamps for their passports .

There is no episcopal see in San Marino, although its name is part of the present diocesan title. Historically, the various parishes in San Marino were divided between two Italian dioceses , mostly in the Diocese of Montefeltro , and partly in the Diocese of Rimini . In 1977, the border between Montefeltro and Rimini was readjusted so that all of San Marino fell within the diocese of Montefeltro. The bishop of Montefeltro-San Marino resides in Pennabilli , in Italy's province of Pesaro e Urbino . The country's high Catholic majority can mainly be traced back to the country's founding, when Saint Marinus set up the first fortress to protect Christians from Roman persecution.

[ 79 ] The small state's culture has primarily remained Catholic ever since.

There is a provision under the income tax rules that taxpayers have the right to request the allocation of 0.3% of their income tax to the Catholic Church or to charities.

The Diocese of San Marino-Montefeltro was until 1977 the historic diocese of Montefeltro. It is a suffragan of the metropolitan Archdiocese of Ravenna-Cervia .

[ 80 ] The diocese includes all the parishes of San Marino. The earliest mention of Montefeltro , as Mona Feretri , is in the diplomas by which Charlemagne confirmed the donation of Pepin . The first known bishop of Montefeltro was Agatho (826), whose residence was at San Leo . Under Bishop Flaminios Dondi (1724) the see was again transferred to San Leo, but later it returned to Pennabilli. The historic diocese was a suffragan of the archdiocese of Urbino .

[ 81 ] Since 1988, there is formally an apostolic nunciature to the republic, but it is vested in the nuncio to Italy.

Other faiths include the Waldensian Church and Jehovah's Witnesses .
There has been a Jewish presence in San Marino for at least 600 years.

[ 82 ] The first mention of Jews in San Marino dates to the late 14th century, in official documents recording the business transactions of Jews. There are many documents throughout the 15th to 17th centuries describing Jewish dealings and verifying the presence of a Jewish community in San Marino.

[ 83 ] Jews were permitted official protection by the government.

During World War II , San Marino provided a haven for more than 100,000 Jews and other Italians (approximately 10 times the Sammarinese population at the time) from Nazi persecution. As of 2012 [update] , few Jews remain.

[ 84 ] In 2019, the sculpture Dialogue by Michele Chiaruzzi was inaugurated at Saint Anne Chapel, the first monument of its kind devoted to interfaith dialogue.

[ 85 ] San Marino also holds the first Shinto shrine built in Europe approved by the Association of Shinto Shrines , that being the San Marino Jinja .

After crossing the international border at Dogana, the highway continues through Italy as the SS72 state road , touching the international border at Rovereta . It serves Cerasolo, a frazione of Coriano , and the Rimini Sud exit of the A14 tolled highway , before terminating at the crossroads with the SS16 [ it ] state road.

[ 88 ] Start Romagna SpA operates several routes that run entirely in Italian territory but near the Sammarinese border, providing connections to Rimini, Verucchio , and Novafeltria .

[ 91 ] [ 92 ] [ 93 ] Rimini and San Marino are connected by the coach companies Bonelli and Benedettini, which provide several services per day throughout the year.

[ 94 ] In the City of San Marino, the coaches depart from the central bus stop in Piazzale Marino Calcigni, [ 94 ] [ 95 ] then stop in Borgo Maggiore , Domagnano , Serravalle , Dogana , and Cerasolo, a frazione of Coriano , before reaching Rimini's Arch of Augustus and railway station .

[ 94 ] The coaches complete the route in approximately fifty minutes.

[ 94 ] Aerial cablecar system [ edit ] Main article: Funivia di San Marino A cablecar overlooks Borgo Maggiore in April 2022.

The terminal of Fellini Airport in March 2018, since its repainting Since the 1980s, the governments of San Marino and Italy have signed several bilateral agreements concerning San Marino's access to Fellini Airport.

[ 107 ] [ 108 ] [ 109 ] After the Sammarinese government acquired a 3% stake in Fellini Airport's management company, Aeradria, in 2002, [ 110 ] the airport was officially named Rimini-San Marino Airport.

[ 111 ] In June 2018, Ariminum, Aeradria's successor as Fellini Airport's management company, repainted the airport terminal to read Aeroporto Internazionale di Rimini e San Marino (Rimini and San Marino International Airport), replacing the previous Aeroporto Internazionale Federico Fellini (Federico Fellini International Airport).

[ 112 ] The most significant bilateral agreement, ratified on 16 September 2013, provided San Marino a forty-year concession over some areas of Fellini Airport.

[ 108 ] [ 113 ] [ 114 ] The areas were expected to host a private terminal, with a customs border allowing goods destined for San Marino not to pass through Italian customs.

[ 114 ] As of August 2023, Sammarinese authorities still have no presence at the airport.

[ 113 ] Torraccia Airfield is San Marino's only aviation facility. It is a small general aviation aerodrome in Torraccia , a village east of the castello of Domagnano, less than 200 metres (660 feet) from the Italian border.

[ 115 ] Torraccia's only grass runway was first used in 1981, but the airfield's structure was opened in 1985.

[ 116 ] [ 117 ] In July 2012, the runway was extended to 650 metres (2,130 feet).

[ 115 ] The airfield is owned and operated by Aeroclub San Marino, [ 115 ] [ 116 ] [ 118 ] a flying club with approximately 100 members.

[ 117 ] In the summer, between ten and fifteen planes typically land at the airfield per day.

[ 116 ] [ 119 ] The airfield hosts a flight school , recreational flights and sports, and some tourist flights in small aircraft.

[ 115 ] [ 117 ] [ 118 ] At the site of the present-day parking lot for the Funivia's Borgo Maggiore terminus was a heliport , [ 120 ] [ 121 ] which inaugurated its first flights in September 1950.

[ 105 ] On 30 June 1959, a helicopter line running between Borgo Maggiore and a heliport by Rimini's port was inaugurated.

[ 105 ] [ 122 ] [ 123 ] Operated by Compagnia Italiana Elicotteri, the service ran several times per day, [ 124 ] [ 123 ] using a fleet of four-seater Bell 47J Rangers and a three-seater Agusta-Bell AB-47G , [ 105 ] [ 124 ] [ 123 ] which were serviced at Rimini's airport.

[ 123 ] In 1964, the line was extended to San Leo .

[ 128 ] [ 129 ] After the war, the railway was abandoned in favour of the San Marino Highway .

[ 129 ] [ 130 ] In 2012, an 800-metre ( 1 ⁄ 2 -mile) section was reopened as a heritage railway in the City of San Marino, running between Piazzale della Stazione and near Via Napoleone.

[ 125 ] The restored section comprises the original railway's final horseshoe turn through the 502-metre (1,647-foot) Montale tunnel.

[ 131 ] [ 132 ] Despite its short operational history, the Rimini–San Marino railway retains an important place in Sammarinese culture and history, [ 130 ] and has featured on Sammarinese postal stamps.

[ 133 ] [ 134 ] [ 135 ] [ 136 ] Both the Sammarinese and Italian governments have expressed interest in reopening the line.

[ 125 ] [ 137 ] [ 138 ] [ 139 ] [ 140 ] Between 1921 and 1960, San Marino was also served by a station on the Rimini–Novafeltria railway in Torello, on the other side of the international border from Gualdicciolo in San Marino's west.

In February, 1952, the Government of San Marino agreed to limit their claim only to compensation for damage caused by the bombing on 26th June, 1944, as they considered—and still consider—that the damage which occurred after the bombardment on 26th June, 1944, was the responsibility of the German Armed Forces.

Nel corso della metà del secolo scorso "l'Ausa, che si stava trasformando sempre di più in una fogna", è stato deviato e fatto confluire nelle acque del Marecchia per mezzo di sponde cementificate che, dai pressi del casello autostradale di Rimini Sud, costeggiano la collina di Covignano. A partire dagli anni sessanta il vecchio corso che sfociava in mare all'altezza di Piazzale Kennedy, venne tombificato.

[During the middle of the last century, "the Ausa, which was increasingly turning into a sewer", was diverted and made to flow into the waters of the Marecchia by means of cemented banks which, near the Rimini Sud motorway exit, skirt the Covignano hill. Starting from the sixties, the old course that flowed into the sea at Piazzale Kennedy was buried.] ^ Dinerstein, Eric; et al. (2017).
