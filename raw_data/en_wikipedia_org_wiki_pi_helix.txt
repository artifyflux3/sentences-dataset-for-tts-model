Two hydrogen bonds to the same peptide group are highlighted in magenta; the oxygen-hydrogen distance is 1.65 Å (165 pm).  The protein chain runs upwards, i.e., its N-terminus is at the bottom and its C-terminus at the top of the figure.  Note that the sidechains point slightly downwards , i.e., towards the N-terminus.

A pi helix (or π-helix ) is a type of secondary structure found in proteins .  Discovered by crystallographer Barbara Low in 1952 [ 1 ] and once thought to be rare, short π-helices are found in 15% of known protein structures and are believed to be an evolutionary adaptation derived by the insertion of a single amino acid into an α-helix .

[ 2 ] Because such insertions are highly destabilizing, [ 3 ] the formation of π-helices would tend to be selected against unless it provided some functional advantage to the protein.  π-helices therefore are typically found near functional sites of proteins.

[ 2 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] Standard structure [ edit ] The amino acids in a standard π-helix are arranged in a right-handed helical structure. Each amino acid corresponds to an 87° turn in the helix (i.e., the helix has 4.1 residues per turn), and a translation of 1.15 Å (0.115 nm ) along the helical axis. Most importantly, the N-H group of an amino acid forms a hydrogen bond with the C=O group of the amino acid five residues earlier; this repeated i + 5 → i hydrogen bonding defines a π-helix. Similar structures include the 3 10 helix ( i + 3 → i hydrogen bonding) and the α-helix ( i + 4 → i hydrogen bonding).

Top view of the same helix shown above. Four carbonyl groups are pointing upwards towards the viewer, spaced roughly 87° apart on the circle, corresponding to 4.1 amino-acid residues per turn of the helix.

The majority of π-helices are only 7 residues in length and do adopt regularly repeating ( φ , ψ ) dihedral angles throughout the entire structure like that of α-helices or β-sheets.  Because of this, textbooks that provide single dihedral values for all residues in the π-helix are misleading.  Some generalizations can be made, however.  When the first and last residue pairs are excluded, dihedral angles exist such that the ψ dihedral angle of one residue and the φ dihedral angle of the next residue sum to roughly −125°.  The first and last residue pairs sum to −95° and −105°, respectively. For comparison, the sum of the dihedral angles for a 3 10 helix is roughly −75°, whereas that for the α-helix is roughly −105°. Proline is often seen immediately following the end of π-helices.  The general formula for the rotation angle Ω per residue of any polypeptide helix with trans isomers is given by the equation 3 cos ⁡ ⁡ Ω Ω = 1 − − 4 cos 2 ⁡ ⁡ ( ϕ ϕ + ψ ψ 2 ) .

{\displaystyle 3\cos \Omega =1-4\cos ^{2}\left({\frac {\phi +\psi }{2}}\right).} Left-handed structure [ edit ] In principle, a left-handed version of the π-helix is possible by reversing the sign of the ( φ , ψ ) dihedral angles to (55°, 70°). This pseudo-"mirror-image" helix  has roughly the same number of residues per turn (4.1) and helical pitch (1.5 Å [150 pm]). It is not a true mirror image, because the amino-acid residues still have a left-handed chirality .    A long left-handed π-helix is unlikely to be observed in proteins because, among the naturally occurring amino acids, only glycine is likely to adopt positive φ dihedral angles such as 55°.

π-helices in nature [ edit ] A short, 7 residue π-helix (orange) is embedded within a longer, α-helix (green). The "bulge" of the π-helix can be clearly seen, and was created as the result of a single amino acid that has been inserted into an α-helix.

PDB code 3QHB.

Commonly used automated secondary structure assignment programs, such as DSSP , suggest <1% of proteins contain a π-helix. This mis-characterization results from the fact that naturally occurring π-helices are typically short in length (7 to 10 residues) and are almost always associated with (i.e. flanked by) α-helices on either end.  Nearly all π-helices are therefore cryptic in that the π-helical residues are incorrectly assigned as either α-helical or as "turns". Recently developed programs have been written to properly annotate π-helices in protein structures and they have found that 1 in 6 proteins (around 15%) do in fact contain at least one π-helical segment.

[ 2 ] Natural π-helices can easily be identified in a structure as a "bulge" within a longer α-helix. Such helical bulges have previously been referred to as α-aneurisms, α-bulges, π-bulges, wide-turns, looping outs and π-turns, but in fact are π-helices as determined by their repeating i + 5 → i hydrogen bonds.

[ 2 ] Evidence suggests that these bulges, or π-helices, are created by the insertion of a single additional amino acid into a pre-existing α-helix. Thus, α-helices and π-helices can be inter-converted by the insertion and deletion of a single amino acid.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] Given both the relatively high rate of occurrence of π-helices and their noted association with functional sites (i.e. active sites) of proteins,  this ability to interconvert between α-helices and π-helices has been an important mechanism of altering and diversifying protein functionality over the course of evolution.

[ 2 ] One of the most notable group of proteins whose functional diversification appears to have been heavily influenced by such an evolutionary mechanism is the ferritin -like superfamily, which includes ferritins , bacterioferritins , rubrerythrins , class I ribonucleotide reductases and soluble methane monooxygenases . Soluble methane monooxygenase is the current record holder for the most number of π-helices in a single enzyme with 13 ( PDB code 1MTY). However, the bacterial homologue of a Na + /Cl − dependent neurotransmitter transporter (PDB code 2A65) holds the record for the most π-helices in a single peptide chain with 8.
