SI units 0.001 s A millisecond (from milli- and second ; symbol: ms ) is a unit of time in the International System of Units equal to one thousandth (0.001 or 10 −3 or 1 / 1000 ) of a second [ 1 ] [ 2 ] or 1000 microseconds .

A millisecond is to one second, as one second is to approximately 16.67 minutes.

A unit of 10 milliseconds may be called a centisecond , and one of 100 milliseconds a decisecond , but these names are rarely used.

[ 3 ] To help compare orders of magnitude of different times , this page lists times between 10 −3 seconds and 10 0 seconds (1 milli second and one second).

See also times of other orders of magnitude .

Horizontal logarithmic scale marked with units of time Examples [ edit ] The Apollo Guidance Computer used metric units internally, with centiseconds used for time calculation and measurement.
