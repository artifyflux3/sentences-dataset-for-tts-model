The two points P and P ' (red) are antipodal because they are ends of a diameter PP ' , a segment of the axis a (purple) passing through the sphere's center O (black).

P and P ' are the poles of a great circle g (green) whose points are equidistant from each (with a central right angle). Any great circle s (blue) passing through the poles is secondary to g .

In mathematics , two points of a sphere (or n-sphere , including a circle ) are called antipodal or diametrically opposite if they are the endpoints of a diameter , a straight line segment between two points on a sphere and passing through its center .

[ 1 ] Given any point on a sphere, its antipodal point is the unique point at greatest distance , whether measured intrinsically ( great-circle distance on the surface of the sphere) or extrinsically ( chordal distance through the sphere's interior). Every great circle on a sphere passing through a point also passes through its antipodal point, and there are infinitely many great circles passing through a pair of antipodal points (unlike the situation for any non-antipodal pair of points, which have a unique great circle passing through both). Many results in spherical geometry depend on choosing non-antipodal points, and degenerate if antipodal points are allowed; for example, a spherical triangle degenerates to an underspecified lune if two of the vertices are antipodal.

The point antipodal to a given point is called its antipodes , from the Greek ἀντίποδες ( antípodes ) meaning "opposite feet"; see Antipodes § Etymology . Sometimes the s is dropped, and this is rendered antipode , a back-formation .

Higher mathematics [ edit ] The concept of antipodal points is generalized to spheres of any dimension: two points on the sphere are antipodal if they are opposite through the centre . Each line through the centre intersects the sphere in two points, one for each ray emanating from the centre, and these two points are antipodal.

The Borsuk–Ulam theorem is a result from algebraic topology dealing with such pairs of points. It says that any continuous function from S n {\displaystyle S^{n}} to R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} maps some pair of antipodal points in S n {\displaystyle S^{n}} to the same point in R n .

{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}.} Here, S n {\displaystyle S^{n}} denotes the n {\displaystyle n} -dimensional sphere and R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} is n {\displaystyle n} -dimensional real coordinate space .

The antipodal map A : S n → → S n {\displaystyle A:S^{n}\to S^{n}} sends every point on the sphere to its antipodal point. If points on the n {\displaystyle n} -sphere are represented as displacement vectors from the sphere's center in Euclidean ( n + 1 ) {\displaystyle (n+1)} -space, then two antipodal points are represented by additive inverses v {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} } and − − v , {\displaystyle -\mathbf {v} ,} and the antipodal map can be defined as A ( x ) = − − x .

{\displaystyle A(\mathbf {x} )=-\mathbf {x} .} The antipodal map preserves orientation (is homotopic to the identity map ) [ 2 ] when n {\displaystyle n} is odd, and reverses it when n {\displaystyle n} is even. Its degree is ( − − 1 ) n + 1 .

{\displaystyle (-1)^{n+1}.} If antipodal points are identified (considered equivalent), the sphere becomes a model of real projective space .
