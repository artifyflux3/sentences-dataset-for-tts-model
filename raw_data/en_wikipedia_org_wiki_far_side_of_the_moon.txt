Photograph of the far side of the Moon, with [Mare Orientale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mare_Orientale "Mare Orientale") (center left) and the _mare_ of the [crater Apollo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_(crater) "Apollo (crater)") (top left) being visible, taken by [Orion spacecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_(spacecraft) "Orion (spacecraft)") during the [Artemis 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis_1 "Artemis 1") mission

The **far side of the Moon** is the hemisphere of the [Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon "Moon") that is facing away from [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth"); the opposite hemisphere is the [near side](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_side_of_the_Moon "Near side of the Moon"). It always has the same part of the Moon oriented away from Earth because of [synchronous rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronous_rotation "Synchronous rotation") in the Moon's [orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_of_the_Moon "Orbit of the Moon"). Compared to the near side, the far side's terrain is rugged, with a multitude of [impact craters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_craters "Impact craters") and relatively few flat and dark [lunar maria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_mare "Lunar mare") ("seas"), giving it an appearance closer to other barren places in the Solar System such as [Mercury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(planet) "Mercury (planet)") and [Callisto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callisto_(moon) "Callisto (moon)"). It has one of the largest craters in the [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System "Solar System"), the [South Pole–Aitken basin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Pole%E2%80%93Aitken_basin "South Pole–Aitken basin"). The hemisphere has sometimes been called the "**Dark side of the Moon**", where "dark" means "unknown" instead of "lacking sunlight" – each location on the Moon experiences two weeks of [sunlight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunlight "Sunlight") while the opposite location experiences night.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon#cite_note-Etymology-Sigurdsson-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon#cite_note-Etymology-O'Conner-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon#cite_note-Etymology-Messer-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon#cite_note-Etymology-Falin-4) Actually it is brighter than the near side, lacking the large areas of darker maria surface.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon#cite_note-q847-5)

About 18 percent of the far side is occasionally visible from Earth due to oscillation and to [libration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libration "Libration"). The remaining 82 percent remained unobserved until 1959, when it was photographed by the Soviet [Luna 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luna_3 "Luna 3") space probe. The [Soviet Academy of Sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Academy_of_Sciences "Soviet Academy of Sciences") published the first atlas of the far side in 1960. The [Apollo 8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_8 "Apollo 8") astronauts were the first humans to see the far side in person when they orbited the Moon in 1968. All crewed and uncrewed [soft landings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_landing "Soft landing") had taken place on the [near side of the Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_side_of_the_Moon "Near side of the Moon"), until January 3, 2019, when the [Chang'e 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chang%27e_4 "Chang'e 4") spacecraft made the first landing on the far side.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon#cite_note-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon#cite_note-7) The [Chang'e 6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chang%27e_6 "Chang'e 6")[sample-return mission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_return_mission "Sample return mission") was launched on May 3, 2024, landed in the [Apollo basin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_(crater) "Apollo (crater)") in the southern hemisphere of the lunar far side and returned to Earth a month later on June 25 with humanity's first lunar samples retrieved from the far side.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon#cite_note-8)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon#cite_note-9)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon#cite_note-10)

Astronomers have suggested installing a large [radio telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_telescope "Radio telescope") on the far side, where the Moon would shield it from possible [radio interference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_interference "Radio interference") from Earth.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon#cite_note-11)

Due to tidal locking, the inhabitants of the central body (Earth) will never be able to see the satellite's (Moon) green area

[Tidal forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_force "Tidal force") from [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth") have slowed the Moon's rotation to the point where the same side is always facing the Earth—a phenomenon called [tidal locking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_locking "Tidal locking"). The other face, most of which is never visible from the Earth, is therefore called the "far side of the Moon". Over time, some crescent-shaped edges of the far side can be seen due to [libration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libration "Libration").[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon#cite_note-12) In total, 59 percent of the Moon's surface is visible from Earth at one time or another. Useful observation of the parts of the far side of the Moon occasionally visible from Earth is difficult because of the low [viewing angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viewing_angle "Viewing angle") from Earth (they cannot be observed "full on"). [_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

A common misconception is that the Moon does not rotate on its axis. If that were so, the whole of the Moon would be visible to Earth over the course of its orbit. Instead, its rotation period matches its orbital period, meaning it turns around once for every orbit it makes: in Earth terms, it could be said that its [day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_day "Lunar day") and its year have the same length (i.e., ~29.5 earth days).[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

The phrase "dark side of the Moon" does not refer to "dark" as in the absence of light, but rather "dark" as in unknown: until humans were able to send spacecraft around the Moon, this area had never been seen.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon#cite_note-Etymology-Sigurdsson-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon#cite_note-Etymology-O'Conner-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon#cite_note-Etymology-Messer-3) In reality, both the near and far sides receive (on average) almost equal amounts of light directly from the Sun. This symmetry is complicated by sunlight reflected from the Earth onto the near side ([earthshine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthshine "Earthshine")),[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon#cite_note-hop-13) and by lunar eclipses, which occur only when the far side is already dark. Lunar eclipses mean that the side facing earth receives fractionally less sunlight than the far side when considered over a long period of time.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

At night under a "full Earth" the near side of the Moon receives on the order of 10 [lux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lux "Lux") of illumination (about what a city sidewalk under streetlights gets; this is 34 times more light than is received on Earth under a [full Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_moon "Full moon")) whereas the far side of the Moon during the lunar night receives only about 0.001 lux of starlight.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon#cite_note-hop-13) Only during a full Moon (as viewed from Earth) is the whole far side of the Moon dark.

The word _dark_ has expanded to refer also to the fact that communication with spacecraft can be blocked while the spacecraft is on the far side of the Moon, during Apollo space missions for example.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon#cite_note-dark-14)

[![Image 4](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/Moon_Farside_LRO.jpg/250px-Moon_Farside_LRO.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Moon_Farside_LRO.jpg)

Detailed view with [Mare Moscoviense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mare_Moscoviense "Mare Moscoviense") visible, by the [Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Reconnaissance_Orbiter "Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter") (LRO)

The two hemispheres of the Moon have dramatically different appearances, with the near side covered in multiple, large [_maria_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_mare "Lunar mare") (Latin for 'seas', since the earliest astronomers incorrectly thought that these plains were seas of [lunar water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_water "Lunar water")). The far side has a battered, densely cratered appearance with few maria. Only 1% of the surface of the far side is covered by maria,[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon#cite_note-15) compared to 31.2% on the near side, making the far side brighter.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon#cite_note-q847-5) One commonly accepted explanation for this difference is related to a higher concentration of heat-producing elements on the near-side hemisphere, as has been demonstrated by [geochemical maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geochemical_modeling "Geochemical modeling") obtained from the [Lunar Prospector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Prospector "Lunar Prospector")[gamma-ray spectrometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma-ray_spectrometer "Gamma-ray spectrometer"). While other factors, such as surface elevation and crustal thickness, could also affect where [basalts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basalt "Basalt") erupt, these do not explain why the far side [South Pole–Aitken basin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Pole%E2%80%93Aitken_basin "South Pole–Aitken basin") (which contains the lowest elevations of the Moon and possesses a thin crust) was not as volcanically active as [Oceanus Procellarum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanus_Procellarum "Oceanus Procellarum") on the near side.

It has also been proposed that the differences between the two hemispheres may have been caused by a collision with a smaller companion moon that also originated from the [Theia collision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_impact_hypothesis "Giant impact hypothesis").[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon#cite_note-16) In this model, the impact led to an accretionary pile rather than a crater, contributing a hemispheric layer of extent and thickness that may be consistent with the dimensions of the far side highlands. The chemical composition of the far side is inconsistent with this model.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

The far side has more visible craters. This is thought to be a result of the effects of lunar lava flows, which cover and obscure craters, rather than a shielding effect from the Earth. [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA "NASA") calculates that the Earth obscures only about 4 [square degrees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_degree "Square degree") out of 41,000 square degrees of the sky as seen from the Moon. "This makes the Earth negligible as a shield for the Moon [and] it is likely that each side of the Moon has received equal numbers of impacts, but the resurfacing by lava results in fewer craters visible on the near side than the far side, even though both sides have received the same number of impacts."[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon#cite_note-17)

Newer research suggests that heat from Earth at the time when the Moon was formed is the reason the near side has fewer impact craters. The [lunar crust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_crust "Lunar crust") consists primarily of [plagioclases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plagioclase "Plagioclase") formed when [aluminium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium "Aluminium") and [calcium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium "Calcium") condensed and combined with [silicates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicate "Silicate") in the mantle. The cooler far side experienced condensation of these elements sooner and so formed a thicker crust; [meteoroid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteoroid "Meteoroid") impacts on the near side would sometimes penetrate the thinner crust here and release [basaltic lava](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basaltic_lava "Basaltic lava") that created the maria, but would rarely do so on the far side.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon#cite_note-18)

The far side exhibits more extreme variations in terrain elevation than the near side. The Moon's highest and lowest points, along with its tallest mountains measured from base to peak, are all located on the far side.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon#cite_note-19)

[![Image 5](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Luna_3_moon.jpg/250px-Luna_3_moon.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Luna_3_moon.jpg)

The 7 October 1959 image by [Luna 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luna_3 "Luna 3"), which revealed for the first time the far side of the Moon. Clearly visible is [Mare Moscoviense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mare_Moscoviense "Mare Moscoviense") (top right) and a mare triplet of [Mare Crisium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mare_Crisium "Mare Crisium"), [Mare Marginis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mare_Marginis "Mare Marginis") and [Mare Smythii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mare_Smythii "Mare Smythii") (left center).

[![Image 6](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/Luna_3_grainy_photo_restoration_and_comparison_with_LRO.png/250px-Luna_3_grainy_photo_restoration_and_comparison_with_LRO.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Luna_3_grainy_photo_restoration_and_comparison_with_LRO.png)

When the first ever image of the far side of the Moon (A) is restored using advanced noise removal techniques (B) and compared to later LRO mission from NASA (C) the important feature points are distinctly visible and a clear, one to one mapping of the visible feature points are noticeable.

Until the late 1950s, little was known about the far side of the Moon. Librations periodically allowed limited glimpses of features near the lunar limb on the far side, but only up to 59% of the total surface of the Moon.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon#cite_note-20) These features were seen from a low angle, hindering useful observation (it proved difficult to distinguish a crater from a mountain range). The remaining 82% of the surface on the far side remained unknown, and its properties were subject to much speculation.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

An example of a far side feature that can be seen through libration is the [Mare Orientale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mare_Orientale "Mare Orientale"), which is a prominent impact basin spanning almost 1,000 km (600 miles), yet this was not even named as a feature until 1906, by [Julius Franz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Heinrich_Franz "Julius Heinrich Franz") in _Der Mond_. The true nature of the basin was discovered in the 1960s when rectified images were projected onto a globe. The basin was photographed in fine detail by [Lunar Orbiter 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Orbiter_4 "Lunar Orbiter 4") in 1967. Before space exploration began, astronomers expected that the far side would be similar to the side visible to Earth.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon#cite_note-ley196604-21)

On 7 October 1959, the [Soviet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union") probe [Luna 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luna_3 "Luna 3") took the first photographs of the lunar far side, eighteen of them resolvable,[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon#cite_note-22)[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon#cite_note-ley196604-21) covering one-third of the surface invisible from the Earth.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon#cite_note-GSE-23) The images were analysed, and the first atlas of the far side of the Moon was published by the [USSR Academy of Sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USSR_Academy_of_Sciences "USSR Academy of Sciences") on 6 November 1960.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon#cite_note-24)[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon#cite_note-25) It included a catalog of 500 distinguished features of the landscape.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon#cite_note-26) In 1961, the first globe (1:13 600 000[scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(map) "Scale (map)"))[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon#cite_note-SAI-27) containing lunar features invisible from the Earth was released in the [USSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USSR "USSR"), based on images from Luna 3.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon#cite_note-28)

On 20 July 1965, another Soviet probe, [Zond 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zond_3 "Zond 3"), transmitted 25 pictures of very good quality of the lunar far side,[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon#cite_note-29) with much better resolution than those from Luna 3. In particular, they revealed chains of craters, hundreds of kilometers in length,[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon#cite_note-GSE-23) but, unexpectedly, no mare plains like those visible from Earth with the naked eye.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon#cite_note-ley196604-21) In 1967, the second part of the _Atlas of the Far Side of the Moon_ was published in [Moscow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow "Moscow"),[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon#cite_note-30)[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon#cite_note-31) based on data from Zond 3, with the catalog now including 4,000 newly discovered features of the lunar far side landscape.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon#cite_note-GSE-23) In the same year, the first _Complete Map of the Moon_ (1:5 000 000 scale[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon#cite_note-SAI-27)) and updated complete globe (1:10 000 000 scale), featuring 95 percent of the lunar surface,[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon#cite_note-SAI-27) were released in the Soviet Union.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon#cite_note-32)[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon#cite_note-33)

As many prominent landscape features of the far side were discovered by Soviet space probes, Soviet scientists selected names for them. This caused some controversy, though the Soviet Academy of Sciences selected many non-Soviet names, including [Jules Verne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_Verne_(crater) "Jules Verne (crater)"), [Marie Curie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curie_(lunar_crater) "Curie (lunar crater)") and [Thomas Edison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edison_(crater) "Edison (crater)").[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon#cite_note-Reichi-34) The [International Astronomical Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Astronomical_Union "International Astronomical Union") later accepted many of the names.

### Further survey missions

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Far_side_of_the_Moon&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Further survey missions")]

[![Image 7](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Back_side_of_the_Moon_AS16-3021.jpg/250px-Back_side_of_the_Moon_AS16-3021.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Back_side_of_the_Moon_AS16-3021.jpg)

The far side of the Moon, with [Mare Marginis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mare_Marginis "Mare Marginis") and [Mare Smythii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mare_Smythii "Mare Smythii") visible, photographed by [Apollo 16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_16 "Apollo 16") in 1972. It is much more cratered than the [near side of the Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_side_of_the_Moon "Near side of the Moon").

On 26 April 1962, [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA "NASA")'s [Ranger 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranger_4 "Ranger 4") space probe became the first spacecraft to impact the far side of the Moon, although it failed to return any scientific data before impact.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon#cite_note-35)

The first truly comprehensive and detailed mapping survey of the far side was undertaken by the American uncrewed [Lunar Orbiter program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Orbiter_program "Lunar Orbiter program") launched by NASA from 1966 to 1967. Most of the coverage of the far side was provided by the final probe in the series, [Lunar Orbiter 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Orbiter_5 "Lunar Orbiter 5").

The far side was first seen directly by human eyes during the [Apollo 8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_8 "Apollo 8") mission in December, 1968. Astronaut [William Anders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Anders "William Anders") described the view:

> "The backside looks like a sand pile my kids have played in for some time. It's all beat up, no definition, just a lot of bumps and holes."

It has been seen by all 24 men who flew on [Apollo 8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_8 "Apollo 8") and [Apollo 10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_10 "Apollo 10") through [Apollo 17](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_17 "Apollo 17"), and photographed by multiple lunar probes. Spacecraft passing behind the Moon were out of direct radio communication with the Earth, and had to wait until the orbit allowed transmission. During the [Apollo missions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Apollo_missions "List of Apollo missions"), the main engine of the Service Module was fired when the vessel was behind the Moon, producing some tense moments in [Mission Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson_Space_Center "Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center") before the craft reappeared.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

Geologist-astronaut [Harrison Schmitt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrison_Schmitt "Harrison Schmitt"), who became the last to step onto the Moon, had aggressively lobbied for Apollo 17's landing site to be on the far side of the Moon, targeting the lava-filled crater [Tsiolkovskiy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsiolkovskiy_(crater) "Tsiolkovskiy (crater)"). Schmitt's ambitious proposal included a special communications satellite based on the existing [TIROS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_Infrared_Observation_Satellite "Television Infrared Observation Satellite") satellites to be launched into a [Farquhar–Lissajous halo orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lissajous_orbit "Lissajous orbit") around the [L2 point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point#L2 "Lagrange point") so as to maintain line-of-sight contact with the astronauts during their powered descent and lunar surface operations. NASA administrators rejected these plans on the grounds of added risk and lack of funding.

The idea of utilizing the Earth–Moon L 2 for a [communications satellite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_satellite "Communications satellite") covering the Moon's far side has been realized, as [China National Space Administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_National_Space_Administration "China National Space Administration") launched the [Queqiao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queqiao "Queqiao") relay satellite in 2018.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon#cite_note-magpie-earth-moon-l2-36) It has since been used for communications between the [Chang'e 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chang%27e_4 "Chang'e 4") lander and [Yutu 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yutu_2 "Yutu 2") rover, which successfully landed in early 2019 on the lunar far side, and ground stations on the Earth. L2 is proposed to be "an ideal location" for a [propellant depot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propellant_depot "Propellant depot") as part of the proposed depot-based space transportation architecture.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon#cite_note-aiaa20100902_p4-37)

The craft included a lander equipped with a low-frequency radio [spectrograph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrograph "Spectrograph") and geological research tools.[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon#cite_note-39) The far side of the Moon provides a good environment for [radio astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_astronomy "Radio astronomy") as interferences from the Earth are blocked by the Moon.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

In February 2020, Chinese astronomers reported, for the first time, a high-resolution image of a [lunar ejecta sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geology_of_the_Moon#Geologic_history "Geology of the Moon"), as well as direct analysis of its internal architecture. These were based on observations made by the [Lunar Penetrating Radar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground-penetrating_radar "Ground-penetrating radar") (LPR) on board the [Yutu-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yutu-2 "Yutu-2") rover.[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon#cite_note-NYT-20200226-40)[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon#cite_note-SA-20200226-41)

CNSA launched [Chang'e 6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chang%27e_6 "Chang'e 6") on 3 May 2024, which conducted the first lunar sample return from [Apollo Basin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_(crater) "Apollo (crater)") on the far side of the Moon.[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon#cite_note-AJ_FI-20230425-42) It was CNSA's second lunar sample return mission, the first achieved by [Chang'e 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chang%27e_5 "Chang'e 5") from the lunar near side four years earlier.[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon#cite_note-43) It also carried a mini "Jinchan" rover to conduct [infrared spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_spectroscopy "Absorption spectroscopy") of lunar surface and imaged the Chang'e 6's lander on the lunar surface.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon#cite_note-44) The lander-ascender-rover combination was separated with the orbiter and returner before landing on 1 June 2024 at 22:23 UTC. It landed on the Moon's surface on 1 June 2024.[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon#cite_note-AJ_FI-20240601-45)[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon#cite_note-segeryu240602-46) The ascender was launched back to lunar orbit on 3 June 2024 at 23:38 UTC, carrying samples collected by the lander, and later completed another robotic rendezvous and docking in lunar orbit. The sample container was then transferred to the returner, which landed in [Inner Mongolia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_Mongolia "Inner Mongolia") on 25 June 2024, completing China's far side sample return mission.[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon#cite_note-47)

Potential uses and missions
---------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Far_side_of_the_Moon&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Potential uses and missions")]

Because the far side of the Moon is shielded from radio transmissions from the Earth, it is considered a good location for placing [radio telescopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_telescope "Radio telescope") for use by [astronomers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomer "Astronomer"). Small, bowl-shaped craters provide a natural formation for a stationary [telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telescope "Telescope") similar to [Arecibo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arecibo_Observatory "Arecibo Observatory") in [Puerto Rico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rico "Puerto Rico"). For much larger-scale telescopes, the 100-kilometer-diameter (60 mi) [crater Daedalus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daedalus_(crater) "Daedalus (crater)") is situated near the center of the far side, and the 3-kilometer-high (2 mi) rim would help to block stray communications from orbiting satellites. Another potential candidate for a radio telescope is the [Saha crater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saha_(crater) "Saha (crater)").[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon#cite_note-cnn_stenger-49)

Before deploying radio telescopes to the far side, several problems must be overcome. The fine [lunar dust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regolith "Regolith") can contaminate equipment, vehicles, and space suits. The conducting materials used for the radio dishes must also be carefully shielded against the effects of [solar flares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_flare "Solar flare"). Finally, the area around the telescopes must be protected against contamination by other radio sources.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

The [L 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point#L2 "Lagrange point")[Lagrange point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point "Lagrange point") of the Earth–Moon system is located about 62,800 km (39,000 mi) above the far side, which has also been proposed as a location for a future radio telescope which would perform a [Lissajous orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lissajous_orbit "Lissajous orbit") about the Lagrangian point.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

One of the NASA missions to the Moon under study would send a sample-return lander to the [South Pole–Aitken basin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Pole%E2%80%93Aitken_basin "South Pole–Aitken basin"), the location of a major impact event that created a formation nearly 2,400 km (1,500 mi) across. The force of this impact has created a deep penetration into the lunar surface, and a sample returned from this site could be analyzed for information concerning the interior of the Moon.[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon#cite_note-50)

Because the near side is partly shielded from the [solar wind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_wind "Solar wind") by the Earth, the far side [maria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_mare "Lunar mare") are expected to have the highest concentration of [helium-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium-3 "Helium-3") on the surface of the Moon.[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon#cite_note-51) This [isotope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope "Isotope") is relatively rare on the Earth, but has good potential for use as a fuel in [fusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion "Nuclear fusion") reactors. Proponents of lunar settlement have cited the presence of this material as a reason for developing a [Moon base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moonbase "Moonbase").[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon#cite_note-Jack_Schmitt's_Moon_base-52)

Thermodynamic stasis and extended hardware life are far easier to obtain without these punishing conditions seen in LEO. L 2 is not just a great gateway—it is a great place to store propellants. ...L 2 is an ideal location to store propellants and cargos: it is close, high energy, and cold. More importantly, it allows the continuous onward movement of propellants from LEO depots, thus suppressing their size and effectively minimizing the near-Earth boiloff penalties.
