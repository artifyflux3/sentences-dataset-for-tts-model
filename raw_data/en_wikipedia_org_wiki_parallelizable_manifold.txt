In mathematics , a differentiable manifold M {\displaystyle M} of dimension n is called parallelizable [ 1 ] if there exist smooth vector fields { V 1 , … … , V n } {\displaystyle \{V_{1},\ldots ,V_{n}\}} on the manifold, such that at every point p {\displaystyle p} of M {\displaystyle M} the tangent vectors { V 1 ( p ) , … … , V n ( p ) } {\displaystyle \{V_{1}(p),\ldots ,V_{n}(p)\}} provide a basis of the tangent space at p {\displaystyle p} .  Equivalently, the tangent bundle is a trivial bundle , [ 2 ] so that the associated principal bundle of linear frames has a global section on M .

{\displaystyle M.} A particular choice of such a basis of vector fields on M {\displaystyle M} is called a parallelization (or an absolute parallelism ) of M {\displaystyle M} .

Examples [ edit ] An example with n = 1 {\displaystyle n=1} is the circle : we can take V 1 to be the unit tangent vector field, say pointing in the anti-clockwise direction. The torus of dimension n {\displaystyle n} is also parallelizable, as can be seen by expressing it as a cartesian product of circles. For example, take n = 2 , {\displaystyle n=2,} and construct a torus from a square of graph paper with opposite edges glued together, to get an idea of the two tangent directions at each point.  More generally, every Lie group G is parallelizable, since a basis for the tangent space at the identity element can be moved around by the action of the translation group of G on G (every translation is a diffeomorphism and therefore these translations induce linear isomorphisms between tangent spaces of points in G ).

A classical problem was to determine which of the spheres S n are parallelizable. The zero-dimensional case S 0 is trivially parallelizable. The case S 1 is the circle, which is parallelizable as has already been explained. The hairy ball theorem shows that S 2 is not parallelizable. However S 3 is parallelizable, since it is the Lie group SU(2) . The only other parallelizable sphere is S 7 ; this was proved in 1958, by Friedrich Hirzebruch , Michel Kervaire , and by Raoul Bott and John Milnor , in independent work. The parallelizable spheres correspond precisely to elements of unit norm in the normed division algebras of the real numbers, complex numbers, quaternions , and octonions , which allows one to construct a parallelism for each. Proving that other spheres are not parallelizable is more difficult, and requires algebraic topology .

The product of parallelizable manifolds is parallelizable.

Every orientable closed three-dimensional manifold is parallelizable.

[ 3 ] Remarks [ edit ] Any parallelizable manifold is orientable .

The term framed manifold (occasionally rigged manifold ) is most usually applied to an embedded manifold with a given trivialisation of the normal bundle , and also for an abstract (that is, non-embedded) manifold with a given stable trivialisation of the tangent bundle .

A related notion is the concept of a π-manifold .

[ 4 ] A smooth manifold M {\displaystyle M} is called a π-manifold if, when embedded in a high dimensional euclidean space, its normal bundle is trivial. In particular, every parallelizable manifold is a π-manifold.
