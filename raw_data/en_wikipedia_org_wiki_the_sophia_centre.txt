[ 1 ] Background and current status [ edit ] In 2004, Michael York , the centre's director, was appointed the world's first professor of cultural astronomy and astrology.

[ 2 ] In 2008 the Centre transferred to the University of Wales, Lampeter .

[ 3 ] The centre is now in the Department of Archaeology, History and Anthropology at the renamed University of Wales Trinity Saint David (formed by the merger of the University of Wales, Lampeter and the Trinity College Carmarthen.

[ 4 ] The current director of the Sophia Centre is Nicholas Campion . The centre's teaching, via the MA in Cultural Astronomy and Astrology, is based in a wide view of astronomy and astrology as providing a framework for culture, and the analysis of the  way in which cosmos provides a reference for human activity.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] The centre began teaching archaeoastronomy in 2010 and holds an annual conference from which several volumes of proceedings have been published (see below).

[ 7 ] Publications [ edit ] The centre is associated with the Sophia Centre Press and publishes the bi-annual journal, Culture and Cosmos .
