In such case, cloud base begins at the convective condensation level (CCL), whilst with mechanical lifting (such as from low-pressure areas located in the lower troposphere, frontal systems , surface boundaries, gravity waves , and convergence zones ), condensation begins at the lifted condensation level (LCL). Convective temperature is important to forecasting thunderstorm development.
