Several types of adhesives can be used.

[ 1 ] Types [ edit ] Main article: List of adhesive tapes Pressure-sensitive tape [ edit ] Main article: Pressure sensitive tape Dennison Mending Tape from the second half of the 20th century. From the Museo del Objeto del Objeto collection Pressure-sensitive tape, PSA tape, self-stick tape or sticky tape consists of a pressure sensitive adhesive coated onto a backing material such as paper , plastic film, cloth, or metal foil. It is sticky (tacky) without any heat or solvent for activation and adheres to surfaces with light pressure.  Typical adhesives are polymers such as acrylates , and natural and synthetic rubber . These tapes usually require a release agent on their backing or a release liner to cover the adhesive.  Sometimes, the term "adhesive tape" is used for these tapes.

Water-activated tape [ edit ] Water-activated tape, gummed paper tape or gummed tape is starch - or sometimes animal glue -based adhesive on a paper backing which becomes sticky when moistened.

A specific type of gummed tape is called reinforced gummed tape (RGT). The backing of this reinforced tape consists of two layers of paper with a cross-pattern of fiberglass filaments laminated between. The laminating adhesive had previously been asphalt but now is more commonly a hot-melt atactic polypropylene .

Water-activated tape in a tape dispenser Water-activated tape is used for closing and sealing boxes. Before closing corrugated fiberboard boxes , the tape is wetted or remoistened. Such tape is usually 3 inches (or 7.5 cm) wide.

Gummed tapes specifications are the subject of ASTM standard D5749.

[ 2 ] Heat-sensitive tape [ edit ] Heat-activated tape is usually tack-free until it is activated by a heat source. This is particularly useful in the semiconductor industry.

Drywall tape [ edit ] Drywall tape is paper, cloth, or mesh, sometimes with a gummed or PSA adhesive. It is used to make the joints between sheets of drywall materials.
