Mack ( 1981-05-01 ) 1 May 1981 (age 44) Alma mater Princeton University ( PhD ) California Institute of Technology ( BS ) Scientific career Fields Cosmology Theoretical astrophysics [ 1 ] Institutions Perimeter Institute North Carolina State University University of Melbourne University of Cambridge Thesis Tests of Early Universe Physics from Observational Astronomy (2009) Doctoral advisor Paul Steinhardt [ 2 ] Katie Mack talking about cosmology Published October 2017 Website www .astrokatie .com Katherine J. Mack (born 1 May 1981) [ 3 ] is a theoretical cosmologist who holds the Hawking Chair in Cosmology and Science Communication at the Perimeter Institute . Her academic research investigates dark matter , vacuum decay , and the Epoch of Reionization .

[ 4 ] [ 1 ] [ 5 ] Mack is also a popular science communicator who participates in social media and regularly writes for Scientific American , Slate , Sky & Telescope , Time , and Cosmos .

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] Early life and education [ edit ] External videos A Tour of the Universe: Women in Physics Lecture Shells of Cosmic Time Mack became interested in science as a child and built solar-powered cars out of Lego blocks.

[ 8 ] Her mother is a fan of science fiction , and encouraged Mack to watch Star Trek and Star Wars .

[ 9 ] Her grandfather was a student at Caltech and worked on the Apollo 11 mission.

[ 10 ] She became more interested in spacetime and the Big Bang after attending talks by scientists such as Stephen Hawking .

[ 8 ] Mack attended California Institute of Technology , and appeared as an extra in the opening credits of the 2001 American comedy film Legally Blonde when they filmed on campus.

[ 11 ] She received her undergraduate degree in physics in 2003.

[ 12 ] [ 13 ] Mack obtained her PhD in astrophysics from Princeton University in 2009.

[ 14 ] Her thesis on the early universe was supervised by Paul Steinhardt .

[ 2 ] [ 15 ] Research and career [ edit ] After earning her doctorate, Mack joined the University of Cambridge as a Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) postdoctoral research fellow at the Kavli Institute for Cosmology .

[ 13 ] Later in 2012, Mack was a Discovery Early Career Researcher Award (DECRA) Fellow at the University of Melbourne .

[ 16 ] Mack was involved with the construction of the dark matter detector SABRE.

[ 17 ] In January 2018, Mack became an assistant professor in the Department of Physics at North Carolina State University and a member of the university's Leadership in Public Science Cluster.

[ 18 ] [ 19 ] She joined the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in June 2022 as the inaugural Hawking Chair in Cosmology and Science Communication.

[ 20 ] [ 21 ] The Canadian multidisciplinary research organization CIFAR named her one of the CIFAR Azrieli Global Scholars in 2022.

[ 22 ] Mack works at the intersection between fundamental physics and astrophysics. Her research considers dark matter , [ 23 ] vacuum decay , [ 24 ] the formation of galaxies, observable tracers of cosmic evolution , and the Epoch of Reionization .

[ 25 ] Mack has described dark matter as "one of science's most pressing enigmas".

[ 26 ] [ 27 ] She has worked on dark matter self-annihilation [ 28 ] and whether the accretion of dark matter could result in the growth of primordial black holes (PBHs).

[ 29 ] She has worked on the impact of PBHs on the cosmic microwave background .

[ 30 ] She has become increasingly interested, too, in the end of the universe .

[ 31 ] Public engagement and advocacy [ edit ] Mack maintains a strong science outreach presence on both social and traditional media.

[ 32 ] [ 33 ] In this wise she has been described by Motherboard and Creative Cultivate as a "social media celebrity".

[ 8 ] [ 17 ] Mack is a popular science writer and has contributed to The Guardian , Scientific American , Slate , The Conversation , Sky & Telescope , Gizmodo , Time , and Cosmos , as well as providing expert information to the BBC .

[ 34 ] [ 35 ] [ 36 ] [ 37 ] [ 38 ] [ 39 ] Mack's Twitter account has over 300,000 followers; her response to a climate change denier on that platform gained mainstream coverage, [ 40 ] [ 41 ] as did her "Chirp for LIGO" upon the first detection of gravitational waves .

[ 42 ] [ 43 ] She was the 2017 Australian Institute of Physics Women in Physics lecturer, in which capacity she spent three weeks delivering talks at schools and universities across Australia.

[ 44 ] [ 45 ] In 2018, Mack was chosen to be one of the judges for Nature magazine's newly founded Nature Research Awards for Inspiring Science and Innovating Science.

[ 46 ] In February 2019, she appeared in an episode of The Jodcast , talking about her work and science communication .

[ 47 ] Mack was a member of the jury for the Alfred P. Sloan Prize in the 2019 Sundance Film Festival .

[ 48 ] In 2019, she was referenced on the Hozier track "No Plan" from his album Wasteland, Baby!

: "As Mack explained, there will be darkness again".

[ 49 ] She is a member of the Sloan Science & Film community, where she works on science fiction .

[ 50 ] [ 51 ] Her first book, The End of Everything (Astrophysically Speaking) , was published by Simon & Schuster in August 2020, the firm having won the rights in an eight-way bidding battle.

[ 52 ] [ 53 ] It considers the five scenarios for the end of the universe (both theoretically and practically), [ 52 ] and has received positive reviews both for its science outreach accuracy and its wit.

[ 54 ] [ 55 ] [ 56 ] The book [ 57 ] was also a New York Times Notable Book and featured on the best books of the year lists of The Washington Post , The Economist , New Scientist , Publishers Weekly , and The Guardian .

[ 58 ] [ 59 ] Mack hosted a podcast with author John Green called Crash Course Pods: The Universe [ 60 ] in 2024.

Personal life [ edit ] Mack is interested in the intersection of art, poetry and science.

[ 61 ] She and the musician Hozier became friends after getting to know one another on Twitter.

[ 62 ] She is bisexual .

[ 63 ] [ 64 ] Mack is also a pilot, having earned her private pilot license during the COVID-19 pandemic .
