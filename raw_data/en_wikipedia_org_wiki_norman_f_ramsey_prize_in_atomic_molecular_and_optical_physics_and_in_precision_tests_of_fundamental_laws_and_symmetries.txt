Ramsey Prize in Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics, and in Precision Tests of Fundamental Laws and Symmetries ) Physics prize The Norman F. Ramsey Prize in Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics, and in Precision Tests of Fundamental Laws and Symmetries is a prize given by the American Physical Society .

[ 1 ] It is awarded for outstanding work in the field of atomic, molecular, and optical physics , especially in the precision measurement of physical constants , tests of fundamental laws and symmetries , and precision spectroscopy .

[ 2 ] Instituted in 2016, the prize pays tribute to Nobel Laureate Norman Ramsey , celebrated for pioneering contributions such as the separated oscillatory field method and the hydrogen maser .

[ 3 ] It consists of $10,000 plus travel expenses to the annual meeting of the Division of Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics (DAMOP) where the prize is bestowed.

Recipients [ edit ] 2018: Peter Zoller [ 2 ] [ 4 ] 2019: Jun Ye [ 5 ] 2020: Philip H. Bucksbaum [ 6 ] 2021: Dmitry Budker [ 7 ] 2022: Mikhail Lukin [ 8 ] 2023: Olga Kocharovskaya [ 9 ] 2024: David DeMille , Gerald Gabrielse , John Doyle [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] 2025: Alan Kostelecký [ 13 ] See also [ edit ] List of physics awards List of American Physical Society prizes and awards References [ edit ] ^ "Norman F.
