**ASCII** ( [_ASS-kee_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Pronunciation_respelling_key "Help:Pronunciation respelling key")),[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-Mackenzie_1980-3): 6  an acronym for **American Standard Code for Information Interchange**, is a [character encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_encoding "Character encoding") standard for representing a particular set of 95 ([English language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language "English language") focused) [printable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printable_character "Printable character") and 33 [control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_character "Control character") characters – a total of 128 [code points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_point "Code point"). The set of available punctuation had significant impact on the syntax of computer languages and text markup. ASCII hugely influenced the design of character sets used by modern computers; for example, the first 128 code points of [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode "Unicode") are the same as ASCII.

ASCII encodes each code-point as a value from 0 to 127 – storable as a seven-[bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit "Bit")[integer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer "Integer").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-RFC-4949-4) Ninety-five code-points are printable, including digits _0_ to _9_, lowercase letters _a_ to _z_, uppercase letters _A_ to _Z_, and commonly used [punctuation symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punctuation_symbol "Punctuation symbol"). For example, the letter `i` is represented as 105 ([decimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal "Decimal")). Also, ASCII specifies 33 non-printing [control codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_code "Control code") which originated with [Teletype devices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletype_Corporation#Teletype_Corporation "Teletype Corporation"); most of which are now obsolete.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-Maini_2007-5) The control characters that are still commonly used include [carriage return](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carriage_return "Carriage return"), [line feed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_feed "Line feed"), and [tab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tab_key#Tab_characters "Tab key").

ASCII lacks code-points for characters with [diacritical marks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritical_mark "Diacritical mark") and therefore does not directly support [terms or names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_terms_with_diacritical_marks "English terms with diacritical marks") such as [résumé](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%A9sum%C3%A9 "Résumé"), [jalapeño](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalape%C3%B1o "Jalapeño"), or [Beyoncé](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyonc%C3%A9 "Beyoncé"). But, depending on hardware and software support, some diacritical marks can be [rendered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendering_(computer_graphics) "Rendering (computer graphics)") by overwriting a letter with a [backtick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtick "Backtick") (`) or [tilde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilde "Tilde") (~).

The [Internet Assigned Numbers Authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Assigned_Numbers_Authority "Internet Assigned Numbers Authority") (IANA) prefers the name **US-ASCII** for this character encoding.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-IANA_2007-2)

ASCII is one of the [IEEE milestones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_IEEE_Milestones "List of IEEE Milestones").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-6)

ASCII is the standardisation of a seven-[bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit "Bit")[teleprinter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleprinter "Teleprinter") code developed in part from earlier [telegraph codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegraph_code "Telegraph code").

Work on the ASCII standard began in May 1961, when [IBM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM "IBM") engineer [Bob Bemer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Bemer "Bob Bemer") submitted a proposal to the American Standards Association's (ASA) (now the [American National Standards Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_National_Standards_Institute "American National Standards Institute") or ANSI) X3.2 subcommittee.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-Brandel_1999-7) The first edition of the standard was published in 1963,[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-ASCII-1963-8) contemporaneously with the introduction of the [Teletype Model 33](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletype_Model_33 "Teletype Model 33"). It later underwent a major revision in 1967,[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-ASCII-1967-9)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-Jennings_2016-10) and several further revisions until 1986.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-ASCII-1986-11) In contrast to earlier telegraph codes such as [Baudot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baudot_code "Baudot code"), ASCII was ordered for more convenient collation (especially alphabetical sorting of lists), and added controls for devices other than teleprinters.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-ASCII-1986-11)

ASCII (1963). [Control Pictures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_Pictures "Control Pictures") of equivalent controls are shown where they exist, or a grey dot otherwise.

ASCII was developed under the auspices of a committee of the American Standards Association (ASA), called the X3 committee, by its X3.2 (later X3L2) subcommittee, and later by that subcommittee's X3.2.4 working group (now [INCITS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INCITS "INCITS")). The ASA later became the United States of America Standards Institute (USASI)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-Mackenzie_1980-3): 211  and ultimately became the [American National Standards Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_National_Standards_Institute "American National Standards Institute") (ANSI).

With the other special characters and control codes filled in, ASCII was published as ASA X3.4-1963,[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-ASCII-1963-8)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-Bukstein_1964-12) leaving 28 code positions without any assigned meaning, reserved for future standardization, and one unassigned control code.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-Mackenzie_1980-3): 66, 245  There was some debate at the time whether there should be more control characters rather than the lowercase alphabet.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-Mackenzie_1980-3): 435  The indecision did not last long: during May 1963 the CCITT Working Party on the New Telegraph Alphabet proposed to assign lowercase characters to _sticks_[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-NB_Stick-14)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-Bemer_1980_Inside-13) 6 and 7,[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-CCITT_1963-15) and [International Organization for Standardization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization "International Organization for Standardization") TC 97 SC 2 voted during October to incorporate the change into its draft standard.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-ISO_1963-16) The X3.2.4 task group voted its approval for the change to ASCII at its May 1963 meeting.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-17) Locating the lowercase letters in _sticks_[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-NB_Stick-14)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-Bemer_1980_Inside-13) 6 and 7 caused the characters to differ in bit pattern from the upper case by a single bit, which simplified [case-insensitive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case-insensitive "Case-insensitive") character matching and the construction of keyboards and printers.

The X3 committee made other changes. It added the [brace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brace_(punctuation) "Brace (punctuation)") and [vertical bar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_bar "Vertical bar") characters.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-18) It renamed some control characters – SOM became [SOH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Start-of-Header "Start-of-Header"). It moved or removed others – RU was removed.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-Mackenzie_1980-3): 247–248  ASCII was subsequently updated as USAS X3.4-1967,[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-ASCII-1967-9)[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-Winter_2010-19) then USAS X3.4-1968,[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-ASCII-1968-20) ANSI X3.4-1977, and finally, ANSI X3.4-1986.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-ASCII-1986-11)[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-Salste_2016-21)

The use of ASCII format for Network Interchange was described in 1969.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-RFC-20_1968-22) That document was formally elevated to an Internet Standard in 2015.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-23)

In the X3.15 standard, the X3 committee also addressed how ASCII should be transmitted ([least significant bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_significant_bit "Least significant bit") first)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-Mackenzie_1980-3): 249–253 [[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-X3.15-1966-30) and recorded on perforated tape. They proposed a [9-track](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9-track "9-track") standard for magnetic tape and attempted to deal with some [punched card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card "Punched card") formats.

Design considerations
---------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=ASCII&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Design considerations")]

The X3.2 subcommittee designed ASCII based on the earlier teleprinter encoding systems. Like other [character encodings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_encoding "Character encoding"), ASCII specifies a correspondence between digital bit patterns and [character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(computing) "Character (computing)") symbols (i.e. [graphemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grapheme "Grapheme") and [control characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_character "Control character")). This allows [digital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_data "Digital data") devices to communicate with each other and to process, store, and communicate character-oriented information such as written language. Before ASCII was developed, the encodings in use included 26 [alphabetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_alphabet "English alphabet") characters, 10 [numerical digits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_digit "Numerical digit"), and from 11 to 25 special graphic symbols. To include all these, and control characters compatible with the [Comité Consultatif International Téléphonique et Télégraphique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCITT "CCITT") (CCITT) [International Telegraph Alphabet No. 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Telegraph_Alphabet_No._2 "International Telegraph Alphabet No. 2") (ITA2) standard of 1932,[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-31)[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-bdcode-32)[FIELDATA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIELDATA "FIELDATA") (1956[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]), and early [EBCDIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBCDIC "EBCDIC") (1963), more than 64 codes were required for ASCII.

ITA2 was in turn based on [Baudot code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baudot_code "Baudot code"), the 5-bit telegraph code Émile Baudot invented in 1870 and patented in 1874.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-bdcode-32)

The committee debated the possibility of a [shift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift_code "Shift code") function (like in [ITA2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITA2 "ITA2")), which would allow more than 64 codes to be represented by a [six-bit code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six-bit_character_code "Six-bit character code"). In a shifted code, some character codes determine choices between options for the following character codes. It allows compact encoding, but is less reliable for [data transmission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transmission "Data transmission"), as an error in transmitting the shift code typically makes a long part of the transmission unreadable. The standards committee decided against shifting, and so ASCII required at least a seven-bit code.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-Mackenzie_1980-3): 215 §13.6, 236 §4

The committee considered an eight-bit code, since eight bits ([octets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octet_(computing) "Octet (computing)")) would allow two four-bit patterns to efficiently encode two digits with [binary-coded decimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary-coded_decimal "Binary-coded decimal"). However, it would require all data transmission to send eight bits when seven could suffice. The committee voted to use a seven-bit code to minimize costs associated with data transmission. Since perforated tape at the time could record eight bits in one position, it also allowed for a [parity bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_bit "Parity bit") for [error checking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_checking "Error checking") if desired.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-Mackenzie_1980-3): 217 §c, 236 §5 [Eight-bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8-bit_computing "8-bit computing") machines (with octets as the native data type) that did not use parity checking typically set the eighth bit to 0.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-Sawyer_1995-33)

### Internal organization

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=ASCII&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Internal organization")]

The code itself was patterned so that most control codes were together and all graphic codes were together, for ease of identification. The first two so-called _ASCII sticks_[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-NB_Stick-14)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-Bemer_1980_Inside-13) (32 positions) were reserved for control characters.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-Mackenzie_1980-3): 220, 236 8, 9)  The ["space" character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(punctuation) "Space (punctuation)") had to come before graphics to make [sorting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm "Sorting algorithm") easier, so it became position 20[hex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal "Hexadecimal");[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-Mackenzie_1980-3): 237 §10  for the same reason, many special signs commonly used as separators were placed before digits. The committee decided it was important to support uppercase [64-character alphabets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixbit_code_pages "Sixbit code pages"), and chose to pattern ASCII so it could be reduced easily to a usable 64-character set of graphic codes,[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-Mackenzie_1980-3): 228, 237 §14  as was done in the [DEC SIXBIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEC_SIXBIT "DEC SIXBIT") code (1963). [Lowercase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_case "Lower case") letters were therefore not interleaved with [uppercase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uppercase "Uppercase"). To keep options available for lowercase letters and other graphics, the special and numeric codes were arranged before the letters, and the letter _A_ was placed in position 41[hex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal "Hexadecimal") to match the draft of the corresponding British standard.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-Mackenzie_1980-3): 238 §18  The digits 0–9 are prefixed with 011, but the remaining [4 bits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nibble "Nibble") correspond to their respective values in binary, making conversion with [binary-coded decimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary-coded_decimal "Binary-coded decimal") straightforward (for example, 5 in encoded to 011 _0101_, where 5 is _0101_ in binary).

Many of the non-alphanumeric characters were positioned to correspond to their shifted position on typewriters; an important subtlety is that these were based on _mechanical_ typewriters, not _electric_ typewriters.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-Savard-34) Mechanical typewriters followed the [_de facto_ standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto_standard "De facto standard") set by the [Remington No. 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remington_No._2 "Remington No. 2") (1878), the first typewriter with a shift key, and the shifted values of `23456789-` were `"#$%_&'()`– early typewriters omitted _0_ and _1_, using _O_ (capital letter _o_) and _l_ (lowercase letter _L_) instead, but `1!` and `0)` pairs became standard once 0 and 1 became common. Thus, in ASCII `!"#$%` were placed in the second stick,[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-NB_Stick-14)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-Bemer_1980_Inside-13) positions 1–5, corresponding to the digits 1–5 in the adjacent stick.[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-NB_Stick-14)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-Bemer_1980_Inside-13) The parentheses could not correspond to _9_ and _0_, however, because the place corresponding to _0_ was taken by the space character. This was accommodated by removing `_` (underscore) from _6_ and shifting the remaining characters, which corresponded to many European typewriters that placed the parentheses with _8_ and _9_. This discrepancy from typewriters led to [bit-paired keyboards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit-paired_keyboard "Bit-paired keyboard"), notably the [Teletype Model 33](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletype_Model_33 "Teletype Model 33"), which used the left-shifted layout corresponding to ASCII, differently from traditional mechanical typewriters.

Electric typewriters, notably the [IBM Selectric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Selectric "IBM Selectric") (1961), used a somewhat different layout that has become _de facto_ standard on computers– following the [IBM PC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PC "IBM PC") (1981), especially [Model M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_M "Model M") (1984)– and thus shift values for symbols on modern keyboards do not correspond as closely to the ASCII table as earlier keyboards did. The `/?` pair also dates to the No. 2, and the `,< .>` pairs were used on some keyboards (others, including the No. 2, did not shift `,` (comma) or `.` (full stop) so they could be used in uppercase without unshifting). However, ASCII split the `;:` pair (dating to No. 2), and rearranged mathematical symbols (varied conventions, commonly `-* =+`) to `:* ;+ -=`.

Some then-common typewriter characters were not included, notably `½ ¼ ¢`, while `^ ` ~` were included as diacritics for international use, and `< >` for mathematical use, together with the simple line characters `\ |` (in addition to common `/`). The _@_ symbol was not used in continental Europe and the committee expected it would be replaced by an accented _À_ in the French variation, so the _@_ was placed in position 40[hex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal "Hexadecimal"), right before the letter A.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-Mackenzie_1980-3): 243

The control codes felt essential for data transmission were the start of message (SOM), end of address (EOA), [end of message](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_of_message "End of message") (EOM), end of transmission (EOT), "who are you?" (WRU), "are you?" (RU), a reserved device control (DC0), synchronous idle (SYNC), and acknowledge (ACK). These were positioned to maximize the [Hamming distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance "Hamming distance") between their bit patterns.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-Mackenzie_1980-3): 243–245

ASCII-code order is also called _ASCIIbetical_ order.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-35)[Collation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collation "Collation") of data is sometimes done in this order rather than "standard" alphabetical order ([collating sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collating_sequence "Collating sequence")). The main deviations in ASCII order are:

*   All uppercase come before lowercase letters; for example, "Z" precedes "a"
*   Digits and many punctuation marks come before letters

An intermediate order converts uppercase letters to lowercase before comparing ASCII values.

[![Image 4](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/US_ASCII_Control_Character_Symbols.png/250px-US_ASCII_Control_Character_Symbols.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:US_ASCII_Control_Character_Symbols.png)

Early symbols assigned to the 32 control characters, space and delete characters. ([ISO 2047](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_2047 "ISO 2047"), MIL-STD-188-100, 1972)

ASCII reserves the first 32 [code points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_point "Code point") (numbers 0–31 decimal) and the last one (number 127 decimal) for [control characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_character "Control character"). These are codes intended to control [peripheral devices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_device "Peripheral device") (such as [printers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_printer "Computer printer")), or to provide [meta-information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata "Metadata") about data streams, such as those stored on magnetic tape. Despite their name, these code points do not represent printable characters (i.e. they are not characters at all, but signals). For debugging purposes, "placeholder" symbols (such as those given in [ISO 2047](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_2047 "ISO 2047") and its predecessors) are assigned to them.

For example, character 0x0A represents the "line feed" function (which causes a printer to advance its paper), and character 8 represents "[backspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backspace "Backspace")". [RFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFC_(identifier) "RFC (identifier)")[2822](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2822) refers to control characters that do not include carriage return, line feed or [white space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitespace_(computer_science) "Whitespace (computer science)") as non-whitespace control characters.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-RFC-2822-36) Except for the control characters that prescribe elementary line-oriented formatting, ASCII does not define any mechanism for describing the structure or appearance of text within a document. Other schemes, such as [markup languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language "Markup language"), address page and document layout and formatting.

The original ASCII standard used only short descriptive phrases for each control character. The ambiguity this caused was sometimes intentional, for example where a character would be used slightly differently on a terminal link than on a [data stream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_stream "Data stream"), and sometimes accidental, for example the standard is unclear about the meaning of "delete".

Probably the most influential single device affecting the interpretation of these characters was the [Teletype Model 33](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletype_Model_33 "Teletype Model 33") ASR, which was a printing terminal with an available [paper tape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_tape "Punched tape") reader/punch option. Paper tape was a very popular medium for long-term program storage until the 1980s, less costly and in some ways less fragile than magnetic tape. In particular, the Teletype Model 33 machine assignments for codes 17 (control-Q, DC1, also known as XON), 19 (control-S, DC3, also known as XOFF), and 127 ([delete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delete_key "Delete key")) became _de facto_ standards. The Model 33 was also notable for taking the description of control-G (code 7, BEL, meaning audibly alert the operator) literally, as the unit contained an actual bell which it rang when it received a BEL character. Because the keytop for the O key also showed a left-arrow symbol (from ASCII-1963, which had this character instead of [underscore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underscore "Underscore")), a noncompliant use of code 15 (control-O, shift in) interpreted as "delete previous character" was also adopted by many early timesharing systems but eventually became neglected.

When a Teletype 33 ASR equipped with the automatic paper tape reader received a control-S (XOFF, an abbreviation for transmit off), it caused the tape reader to stop; receiving control-Q (XON, transmit on) caused the tape reader to resume. This so-called [flow control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_control_(data) "Flow control (data)") technique became adopted by several early computer operating systems as a "handshaking" signal warning a sender to stop transmission because of impending [buffer overflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_overflow "Buffer overflow"); it persists to this day in many systems as a manual output control technique. On some systems, control-S retains its meaning, but control-Q is replaced by a second control-S to resume output.

The 33 ASR also could be configured to employ control-R (DC2) and control-T (DC4) to start and stop the tape punch; on some units equipped with this function, the corresponding control character lettering on the keycap above the letter was TAPE and ~~TAPE~~ respectively.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-McConnell-37)

#### Delete vs backspace

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=ASCII&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Delete vs backspace")]

The Teletype could not move its typehead backwards, so it did not have a key on its keyboard to send a BS (backspace). Instead, there was a key marked RUB OUT that sent code 127 (DEL). The purpose of this key was to erase mistakes in a manually-input paper tape: the operator had to push a button on the tape punch to back it up, then type the rubout, which punched all holes and replaced the mistake with a character that was intended to be ignored.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-38) Teletypes were commonly used with the less-expensive computers from [Digital Equipment Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation "Digital Equipment Corporation") (DEC); these systems had to use what keys were available, and thus the DEL character was assigned to erase the previous character.[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-pdp-6-monitor-manual-39)[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-pdp-10-monitor-manual-40) Because of this, DEC video terminals (by default) sent the DEL character for the key marked "Backspace" while the separate key marked "Delete" sent an [escape sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_sequence "Escape sequence"); many other competing terminals sent a BS character for the backspace key.

The early Unix tty drivers, unlike some modern implementations, allowed only one character to be set to erase the previous character in canonical input processing (where a very simple line editor is available); this could be set to BS _or_ DEL, but not both, resulting in recurring situations of ambiguity where users had to decide depending on what terminal they were using ([shells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing) "Shell (computing)") that allow line editing, such as [ksh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KornShell "KornShell"), [bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell) "Bash (Unix shell)"), and [zsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell "Z shell"), understand both). The assumption that no key sent a BS character allowed Ctrl+H to be used for other purposes, such as the "help" prefix command in [GNU Emacs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Emacs "GNU Emacs").[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-41)

Many more of the control characters have been assigned meanings quite different from their original ones. The "escape" character (ESC, code 27), for example, was intended originally to allow sending of other control characters as literals instead of invoking their meaning, an "escape sequence". This is the same meaning of "escape" encountered in URL encodings, [C language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language) "C (programming language)") strings, and other systems where certain characters have a reserved meaning. Over time this interpretation has been co-opted and has eventually been changed.

In modern usage, an ESC sent _to_ the terminal usually indicates the start of a command sequence, which can be used to address the cursor, scroll a region, set/query various terminal properties, and more. They are usually in the form of a so-called "[ANSI escape code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code "ANSI escape code")" (often starting with a "[Control Sequence Introducer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_Sequence_Introducer "Control Sequence Introducer")", "CSI", "ESC [") from ECMA-48 (1972) and its successors. Some escape sequences do not have introducers, like the "Reset to Initial State", "RIS" command "ESC c".[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-42)

In contrast, an ESC read _from_ the terminal is most often used as an [out-of-band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-of-band_data "Out-of-band data") character used to terminate an operation or special mode, as in the [TECO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_Editor_and_Corrector "Text Editor and Corrector") and [vi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi_(text_editor) "Vi (text editor)")[text editors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editor "Text editor"). In [graphical user interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface "Graphical user interface") (GUI) and [windowing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_(computing) "Window (computing)") systems, ESC generally causes an application to abort its current operation or to [exit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_(system_call) "Exit (system call)") (terminate) altogether.

The inherent ambiguity of many control characters, combined with their historical usage, created problems when transferring "plain text" files between systems. The best example of this is the [newline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline "Newline") problem on various [operating systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system "Operating system"). Teletype machines required that a line of text be terminated with both "carriage return" (which moves the printhead to the beginning of the line) and "line feed" (which advances the paper one line without moving the printhead). The name "carriage return" comes from the fact that on a manual [typewriter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typewriter "Typewriter") the carriage holding the paper moves while the typebars that strike the ribbon remain stationary. The entire carriage had to be pushed (returned) to the right in order to position the paper for the next line.

DEC operating systems ([OS/8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS/8 "OS/8"), [RT-11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RT-11 "RT-11"), [RSX-11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSX-11 "RSX-11"), [RSTS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSTS/E "RSTS/E"), [TOPS-10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOPS-10 "TOPS-10"), etc.) used both characters to mark the end of a line so that the console device (originally Teletype machines) would work. By the time so-called "glass TTYs" (later called CRTs or "dumb terminals") came along, the convention was so well established that [backward compatibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_compatibility "Backward compatibility") necessitated continuing to follow it. When [Gary Kildall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Kildall "Gary Kildall") created [CP/M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP/M "CP/M"), he was inspired by some of the command line interface conventions used in DEC's RT-11 operating system.

Until the introduction of PC DOS in 1981, [IBM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM "IBM") had no influence in this because their 1970s operating systems used EBCDIC encoding instead of ASCII, and they were oriented toward punch-card input and line printer output on which the concept of "carriage return" was meaningless. IBM's PC DOS (also marketed as [MS-DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS "MS-DOS") by Microsoft) inherited the convention by virtue of being loosely based on CP/M,[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-43) and [Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows "Windows") in turn inherited it from MS-DOS.

Requiring two characters to mark the end of a line introduces unnecessary complexity and ambiguity as to how to interpret each character when encountered by itself. To simplify matters, [plain text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_text "Plain text") data streams, including files, on [Multics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multics "Multics") used line feed (LF) alone as a line terminator.[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-44): 357  The tty driver would handle the LF to CRLF conversion on output so files can be directly printed to terminal, and NL (newline) is often used to refer to CRLF in [UNIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIX "UNIX") documents. [Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix "Unix") and [Unix-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like "Unix-like") systems, and [Amiga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga "Amiga") systems, adopted this convention from Multics. On the other hand, the original [Macintosh OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_OS "Macintosh OS"), [Apple DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_DOS "Apple DOS"), and [ProDOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ProDOS "ProDOS") used carriage return (CR) alone as a line terminator; however, since Apple later replaced these obsolete operating systems with their Unix-based [macOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS "MacOS") (formerly named OS X) operating system, they now use line feed (LF) as well. The Radio Shack [TRS-80](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS-80 "TRS-80") also used a lone CR to terminate lines.

Computers attached to the [ARPANET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET "ARPANET") included machines running operating systems such as TOPS-10 and [TENEX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TENEX_(operating_system) "TENEX (operating system)") using CR-LF line endings; machines running operating systems such as Multics using LF line endings; and machines running operating systems such as [OS/360](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS/360 "OS/360") that represented lines as a character count followed by the characters of the line and which used EBCDIC rather than ASCII encoding. The [Telnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telnet "Telnet") protocol defined an ASCII "Network Virtual Terminal" (NVT), so that connections between hosts with different line-ending conventions and character sets could be supported by transmitting a standard text format over the network. Telnet used ASCII along with CR-LF line endings, and software using other conventions would translate between the local conventions and the NVT.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-RFC-158-45) The [File Transfer Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol "File Transfer Protocol") adopted the Telnet protocol, including use of the Network Virtual Terminal, for use when transmitting commands and transferring data in the default ASCII mode.[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-RFC-542-46)[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-RFC-765-47) This adds complexity to implementations of those protocols, and to other network protocols, such as those used for E-mail and the World Wide Web, on systems not using the NVT's CR-LF line-ending convention.[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-48)[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-49)

The PDP-6 monitor,[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-pdp-6-monitor-manual-39) and its PDP-10 successor TOPS-10,[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-pdp-10-monitor-manual-40) used control-Z (SUB) as an end-of-file indication for input from a terminal. Some operating systems such as CP/M tracked file length only in units of disk blocks, and used control-Z to mark the end of the actual text in the file.[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-50) For these reasons, EOF, or [end-of-file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-of-file "End-of-file"), was used colloquially and conventionally as a [three-letter acronym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-letter_acronym "Three-letter acronym") for control-Z instead of SUBstitute. The end-of-text character ([ETX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-of-text_character "End-of-text character")), also known as [control-C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control-C "Control-C"), was inappropriate for a variety of reasons, while using control-Z as the control character to end a file is analogous to the letter Z's position at the end of the alphabet, and serves as a very convenient [mnemonic aid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic_device "Mnemonic device"). A historically common and still prevalent convention uses the ETX character convention to interrupt and halt a program via an input data stream, usually from a keyboard.

The Unix terminal driver uses the end-of-transmission character ([EOT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-of-Transmission_character "End-of-Transmission character")), also known as control-D, to indicate the end of a data stream.

In the [C programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_programming_language "C programming language"), and in Unix conventions, the [null character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_character "Null character") is used to terminate text [strings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science) "String (computer science)"); such [null-terminated strings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null-terminated_string "Null-terminated string") can be known in abbreviation as ASCIZ or ASCIIZ, where here Z stands for "zero".

### Printable character table

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=ASCII&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Printable character table")]

At the time of adoption, the codes 20 hex to 7E hex would cause the printing of a visible character (a glyph), and thus were designated "printable characters". These codes represent letters, digits, [punctuation marks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punctuation_mark "Punctuation mark"), and a few miscellaneous symbols. There are 95 printable characters in total.[[n]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-63)

The empty space between words, as produced by the space bar of a keyboard, is character code 20 hex. Since the space character is visible in printed text it considered a "printable character", even though it is unique in having no visible glyph. It is listed in the printable character table, as per the ASCII standard, instead of in the control character table.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-Mackenzie_1980-3): 223 [[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-RFC-20_1968-22)

Code 7F hex corresponds to the non-printable "delete" (DEL) control character and is listed in the control character table.

Earlier versions of ASCII used the up arrow instead of the [caret](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caret_(computing) "Caret (computing)") (5E hex) and the left arrow instead of the underscore (5F hex).[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-ASCII-1963-8)[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-Haynes_2015-64)

ASCII was first used commercially during 1963 as a seven-bit teleprinter code for [American Telephone & Telegraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Telephone_%26_Telegraph "American Telephone & Telegraph")'s TWX (TeletypeWriter eXchange) network. TWX originally used the earlier five-bit [ITA2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITA2 "ITA2"), which was also used by the competing [Telex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telex "Telex") teleprinter system. [Bob Bemer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_William_Bemer "Robert William Bemer") introduced features such as the [escape sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_character "Escape character").[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-Brandel_1999-7) His British colleague [Hugh McGregor Ross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_McGregor_Ross "Hugh McGregor Ross") helped to popularize this work– according to Bemer, "so much so that the code that was to become ASCII was first called the _Bemer–Ross Code_ in Europe".[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-65) Because of his extensive work on ASCII, Bemer has been called "the father of ASCII".[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-thocp-66)

On March 11, 1968, US President [Lyndon B. Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson "Lyndon B. Johnson") mandated that all computers purchased by the [United States Federal Government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Federal_Government "United States Federal Government") support ASCII, stating:[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-Johnson_1968-67)[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-68)[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-Folts_1982-69)

> I have also approved recommendations of the [Secretary of Commerce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_Commerce "Secretary of Commerce") [[Luther H. Hodges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luther_H._Hodges "Luther H.

ASCII was the most common character encoding on the [World Wide Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web "World Wide Web") until December 2007, when the [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8 "UTF-8") encoding surpassed it; UTF-8 is [backward compatible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_compatible "Backward compatible") with ASCII.[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-Dubost_2008-70)[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-UTF-8_2008-71)[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-Davis_2010-72)

Variants and derivations
------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=ASCII&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Variants and derivations")]

As computer technology spread throughout the world, different [standards bodies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization "Standardization") and corporations developed many variations of ASCII to facilitate the expression of non-English languages that used Roman-based alphabets. One could class some of these variations as "[ASCII extensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_extension "ASCII extension")", although some misuse that term to represent all variants, including those that do not preserve ASCII's character-map in the 7-bit range. Furthermore, the ASCII extensions have also been mislabelled as ASCII.

From early in its development,[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-73) ASCII was intended to be just one of several national variants of an international character code standard.

Other international standards bodies have ratified character encodings such as [ISO 646](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_646 "ISO 646") (1967) that are identical or nearly identical to ASCII, with extensions for characters outside the English [alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet "Alphabet") and symbols used outside the United States, such as the symbol for the United Kingdom's [pound sterling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling "Pound sterling") (£); e.g. with [code page 1104](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_page_1104 "Code page 1104"). Almost every country needed an adapted version of ASCII, since ASCII suited the needs of only the US and a few other countries. For example, Canada had its own version that supported French characters.

Many other countries developed variants of ASCII to include non-English letters (e.g. [é](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89 "É"), [ñ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%91 "Ñ"), [ß](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9F "ß"), [Ł](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%81 "Ł")), currency symbols (e.g. [£](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C2%A3 "£"), [¥](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C2%A5 "¥")), etc. See also [YUSCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YUSCII "YUSCII") (Yugoslavia).

It would share most characters in common, but assign other locally useful characters to several [code points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_point "Code point") reserved for "national use". However, the four years that elapsed between the publication of ASCII-1963 and ISO's first acceptance of an international recommendation during 1967[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-Mar%C3%A9chal_1967-74) caused ASCII's choices for the national use characters to seem to be _de facto_ standards for the world, causing confusion and incompatibility once other countries did begin to make their own assignments to these code points.

ISO/IEC 646, like ASCII, is a 7-bit character set. It does not make any additional codes available, so the same code points encoded different characters in different countries. Escape codes were defined to indicate which national variant applied to a piece of text, but they were rarely used, so it was often impossible to know what variant to work with and, therefore, which character a code represented, and in general, text-processing systems could cope with only one variant anyway.

Because the bracket and brace characters of ASCII were assigned to "national use" code points that were used for accented letters in other national variants of ISO/IEC 646, a German, French, or Swedish, etc. programmer using their national variant of ISO/IEC 646, rather than ASCII, had to write, and thus read, something such as

`ä aÄiÜ = 'Ön'; ü`

instead of

`{ a[i] = '\n'; }`

[C trigraphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_trigraph "C trigraph") were created to solve this problem for [ANSI C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_C "ANSI C"), although their late introduction and inconsistent implementation in compilers limited their use. Many programmers kept their computers on ASCII, so plain-text in Swedish, German etc. (for example, in e-mail or [Usenet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet "Usenet")) contained "{, }" and similar variants in the middle of words, something those programmers got used to. For example, a Swedish programmer mailing another programmer asking if they should go for lunch, could get "N{ jag har sm|rg}sar" as the answer, which should be "Nä jag har smörgåsar" meaning "No I've got sandwiches".

In Japan and Korea, still as of the 2020s, a variation of ASCII is used, in which the [backslash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backslash "Backslash") (5C hex) is rendered as ¥ (a [Yen sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yen_sign "Yen sign"), in Japan) or ₩ (a [Won sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Won_sign "Won sign"), in Korea). This means that, for example, the file path C:\Users\Smith is shown as C:¥Users¥Smith (in Japan) or C:₩Users₩Smith (in Korea).

In Europe, [teletext character sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletext_character_set "Teletext character set"), which are variants of ASCII, are used for broadcast TV subtitles, defined by [World System Teletext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_System_Teletext "World System Teletext") and broadcast using the DVB-TXT standard for embedding teletext into DVB transmissions.[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-75) In the case that the subtitles were initially authored for teletext and converted, the derived subtitle formats are constrained to the same character sets.

Eventually, as 8-, [16-](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16-bit_computing "16-bit computing"), and [32-bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/32-bit_computing "32-bit computing") (and later [64-bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/64-bit_computing "64-bit computing")) computers began to replace [12-](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12-bit_computing "12-bit computing"), [18-](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/18-bit_computing "18-bit computing"), and [36-bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/36-bit_computing "36-bit computing") computers as the norm, it became common to use an 8-bit byte to store each character in memory, providing an opportunity for extended, 8-bit relatives of ASCII. In most cases these developed as true extensions of ASCII, leaving the original character-mapping intact, but adding additional character definitions after the first 128 (i.e., 7-bit) characters. ASCII itself remained a seven-bit code: the term "extended ASCII" has no official status.

For some countries, 8-bit extensions of ASCII were developed that included support for characters used in local languages; for example, [ISCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISCII "ISCII") for India and [VISCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VISCII "VISCII") for Vietnam.

Even for markets where it was not necessary to add many characters to support additional languages, manufacturers of early home computer systems often developed their own 8-bit extensions of ASCII to include additional characters, such as [box-drawing characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box-drawing_characters "Box-drawing characters"), [semigraphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semigraphics "Semigraphics"), and [video game sprites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprite_(computer_graphics) "Sprite (computer graphics)"). Often, these additions also replaced control characters (index 0 to 31, as well as index 127) with even more platform-specific extensions. In other cases, the extra bit was used for some other purpose, such as toggling [inverse video](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_video "Inverse video"); this approach was used by [ATASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATASCII "ATASCII"), an extension of ASCII developed by [Atari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari "Atari").

Most ASCII extensions are based on ASCII-1967 (the current standard), but some extensions are instead based on the earlier ASCII-1963. For example, [PETSCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PETSCII "PETSCII"), which was developed by [Commodore International](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_International "Commodore International") for their [8-bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8-bit_computing "8-bit computing") systems, is based on ASCII-1963. Likewise, many [Sharp MZ character sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharp_MZ_character_set "Sharp MZ character set") are based on ASCII-1963.

IBM defined [code page 437](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_page_437 "Code page 437") for the [IBM PC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PC "IBM PC"), replacing the control characters with graphic symbols such as [smiley faces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoticon "Emoticon"), and mapping additional graphic characters to the upper 128 positions.[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-76)[Digital Equipment Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation "Digital Equipment Corporation") developed the [Multinational Character Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinational_Character_Set "Multinational Character Set") (DEC-MCS) for use in the popular [VT220](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VT220 "VT220")[terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_terminal "Computer terminal") as one of the first extensions designed more for international languages than for block graphics. [Apple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc. "Apple Inc.") defined [Mac OS Roman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_Roman "Mac OS Roman") for the Macintosh and [Adobe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Inc. "Adobe Inc.") defined the [PostScript Standard Encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript_Standard_Encoding "PostScript Standard Encoding") for [PostScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript "PostScript"); both sets contained "international" letters, typographic symbols and punctuation marks instead of graphics, more like modern character sets.

The [ISO/IEC 8859](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859 "ISO/IEC 8859") standard (derived from the DEC-MCS) provided a standard that most systems copied (or at least were based on, when not copied exactly). A popular further extension designed by Microsoft, [Windows-1252](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows-1252 "Windows-1252") (often mislabeled as [ISO-8859-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO-8859-1 "ISO-8859-1")), added the typographic punctuation marks needed for traditional text printing. ISO-8859-1, Windows-1252, and the original 7-bit ASCII were the most common character encoding methods on the [World Wide Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web "World Wide Web") until 2008, when [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8 "UTF-8") overtook them.[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-UTF-8_2008-71)

[ISO/IEC 4873](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_4873 "ISO/IEC 4873") introduced 32 additional control codes defined in the 80–9F [hexadecimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal "Hexadecimal") range, as part of extending the 7-bit ASCII encoding to become an 8-bit system.[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-Unicode-5.0_2006-77)

[Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode "Unicode") and the ISO/IEC 10646 [Universal Character Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Character_Set "Universal Character Set") (UCS) have a much wider array of characters and their various encoding forms have begun to supplant ISO/IEC 8859 and ASCII rapidly in many environments. While ASCII is limited to 128 characters, Unicode and the UCS support more characters by separating the concepts of unique identification (using [natural numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number "Natural number") called _code points_) and encoding (to 8-, 16-, or 32-bit binary formats, called [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8 "UTF-8"), [UTF-16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-16 "UTF-16"), and [UTF-32](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-32 "UTF-32"), respectively).

ASCII was incorporated into the Unicode (1991) character set as the first 128 symbols, so the 7-bit ASCII characters have the same numeric codes in both sets. This allows [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8 "UTF-8") to be [backward compatible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_compatibility "Backward compatibility") with 7-bit ASCII, as a UTF-8 file containing only ASCII characters is identical to an ASCII file containing the same sequence of characters. Even more importantly, [forward compatibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_compatibility "Forward compatibility") is ensured as software that recognizes only 7-bit ASCII characters as special and does not alter bytes with the highest bit set (as is often done to support 8-bit ASCII extensions such as ISO-8859-1) will preserve UTF-8 data unchanged.[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-78)

2.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_ref-51)**The Unicode characters from the "Control Pictures" area U+2400 to U+2421 reserved for representing control characters when it is necessary to print or display them rather than have them perform their intended function. Some browsers may not display these properly.
3.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_ref-52)**Caret notation is often used to represent control characters on a terminal. On most text terminals, holding down the [Ctrl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_key "Control key") key while typing the second character will type the control character. Sometimes the shift key is not needed, for instance `^@` may be typable with just Ctrl+2 or Ctrl+Space.
4.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_ref-53)**Character escape sequences in C programming language and many other languages influenced by it, such as [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language) "Java (programming language)") and [Perl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl "Perl") (though not all implementations necessarily support all escape sequences).
5.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_ref-54)** Entering any Single-Byte character is supported by escaping its octal value. However, because of the role of NULL in [C-strings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null-terminated_string "Null-terminated string"), this case see particular use.
6.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_ref-55)**The [Backspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backspace "Backspace") character can also be entered by pressing the ← Backspace key on some systems.

To delete the previous character, one had to back up the paper tape punch, which for mechanical and simplicity reasons was a button on the punch itself and not the keyboard, then type the rubout character. They therefore placed a key producing rubout at the location used on typewriters for backspace. When systems used these terminals and provided command-line editing, they had to use the "rubout" code to perform a backspace, and often did not interpret the backspace character (they might echo "^H" for backspace). Other terminals not designed for paper tape made the key at this location produce Backspace, and systems designed for these used that character to back up. Since the delete code often produced a backspace effect, this also forced terminal manufacturers to make any Delete key produce something other than the Delete character.
8.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_ref-57)**The [Tab character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tab_character "Tab character") can also be entered by pressing the Tab ↹ key on most systems.
9.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_ref-58)**The [Carriage Return](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carriage_Return "Carriage Return") character can also be entered by pressing the ↵ Enter or Return key on most systems.
10.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_ref-59)**The \e[escape sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_sequence "Escape sequence") is not part of [ISO C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_C "ISO C") and many other language specifications.

Engineering and Technology History Wiki (ETHW). Retrieved 2023-02-14. There was the change from 1961 ASCII to 1968 ASCII. Some computer languages used characters in 1961 ASCII such as up arrow and left arrow. These characters disappeared from 1968 ASCII. We worked with Fred Mocking, who by now was in Sales at [Teletype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletype_Corporation "Teletype Corporation"), on a type cylinder that would compromise the changing characters so that the meanings of 1961 ASCII were not totally lost. The underscore character was made rather wedge-shaped so it could also serve as a left arrow.
