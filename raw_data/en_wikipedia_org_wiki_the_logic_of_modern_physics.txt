History [ edit ] The Logic of Modern Physics is a 1927 philosophy of science book by American physicist and Nobel laureate Percy Williams Bridgman notable for explicitly identifying, analyzing, and explaining operationalism for the first time.

[ 1 ] Pragmatic philosophers like Charles Sanders Peirce in the 1870s had already advanced solutions to the related ontological problems.

[ 2 ] Also, Sir Arthur Eddington had discussed notions similar to operationalization in 1920 before Bridgman.

[ 3 ] Bridgman's formulation, however, became the most influential.

[ 4 ] In 1955 the variant operationism was described by A. Cornelius Benjamin .

[ 5 ] Influence [ edit ] Operationalism can be considered a variation on the positivist theme, and, arguably, a very powerful and influential one.

[ 6 ] The book was widely read by scholars in the social sciences , in which it had a huge influence in the 1930s and 1940s, [ 6 ] In the social sciences, the main influence has been in psychology, ( behaviorism ), where it has been even greater than that on the methodology in physics, for which it was originally intended.

[ 4 ] Examples of the influence on psychology in the 1930s and 1940s include Stanley Smith Stevens ( The Operational Basis of Psychology and The Operational Definition of Psychological Concepts ), and Clark L. Hull ( The Principles of Behavior: An Introduction to Behavior Theory ).

[ 7 ] Since then, it has been the central influence of the official epistemology governing psychological method for the whole century." [ 8 ] See also [ edit ] Edward C.
