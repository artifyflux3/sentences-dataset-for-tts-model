He was professor emeritus of the KEK high-energy physics laboratory and Kyōto University .

Nishikawa graduated from Kyōto University in 1971 and completed his doctorate at Northwestern in 1980 working with David Buchholz [ Wikidata ] . After working at the University of Chicago , State University of New York , and Tōkyō University , he combined positions at KEK and Kyōto University, eventually becoming director of the Institute for Particle and Nuclear physics at the KEK laboratory and deputy director of the J-PARC proton accelerator facility.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Nishikawa's most notable achievements were as founder and leader of the K2K and T2K experiments.

[ 3 ] K2K, which ran from 1999 until 2005, used the Super Kamiokande detector in Kamioka to measure a controlled beam of neutrinos emitted by the KEK proton synchrotron. The K2K team verified with greater accuracy the neutrino oscillations observed in atmospheric neutrinos by the Super Kamiokande experiment.

[ 4 ] The T2K experiment, which began in 2010 as a successor to K2K, used neutrino beams from the J-PARC proton accelerator with the Super Kamiokande detector to observe neutrino oscillations with specific start and end flavors, thereby measuring the parameters of this flavor-switching behavior.

[ 5 ] In 2016, Nishikawa and the K2K and T2K groups received the Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics together with other neutrino research collaborations.

[ 6 ] He was awarded the Nishina Memorial Prize in 2005, [ 7 ] and the Bruno Pontecorvo Prize in 2016.

[ 8 ] He also received the 1998 Asahi Prize as part of the Super-Kamiokande experiment that discovered the mass of neutrinos.
