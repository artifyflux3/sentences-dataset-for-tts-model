Find sources: "Underwater rugby in the United States" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( August 2009 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Underwater Rugby is a team watersport played in swimming pools on breathhold.

Underwater rugby has been played in the United States since 1979.

History [ edit ] Nick Caloyianis started the first team at Catonsville Community College (now called Community College of Baltimore County , Catonsville ). He is a famous underwater filmmaker and director, with several televised specials.

[ citation needed ] Catonsville Community College is just south of the Baltimore Beltway, and south of the city limits. Anne Arundel Community College had a competing team for several years. It was also played for a while at the YMCA pool in Severna Park, Arundel Olympic Swim Center pool in Annapolis, and briefly in a pool in Columbia and at Howard Community College. For several years after the start of UW Rugby in the USA, there were no players from Colombia, South America. However, they participated in the 1990s, with players on the men's team in the 1999 and 2003 World Championships, and on the women's team in the 2003 World Championships.

] Voting representatives for the international CMAS rules changes were sent to the CMAS 1987 Underwater Rugby Worlds in Zurich, Switzerland, and to the worlds in 1991 in Copenhagen, Denmark. Boston started a team a couple of years later than Baltimore and Boston still plays both Underwater Rugby and more recently underwater hockey .

Around the year 2000, UW Rugby events in the US were basically UWR Clinics on which players from different parts of the country met to play during a weekend and play on a potluck format. After fail attempts to put together a National team to go to the World Championships of 2007 in Italy and 2011 in Finland, the only active clubs in the US (East Haven Makos, New Jersey Hammerheads, and Boston Narwhals) decided to join efforts with their Canadian counterparts (CAMO, Club Liberation) and started a Local Competition called the North American Underwater Rugby Tournaments (NAT) to raise the level of the game in both countries as well as provide continuous competition throughout the years for both countries.

With the North American Tournaments (NAT) the competition and level of play started to grow the sport and additional teams began to appear and expand the NAT tournaments. New Clubs started in the DC area, Florida, and later Wisconsin and California.

NAT tournaments also became attractive to clubs from other countries and participation especially from Colombian Clubs has been an additional motivation for local clubs.

The North American Underwater Rugby Tournaments (NAT) started in 2011 as a competition of US and Canadian Clubs with the purpose of providing local and continuous competition throughout the year in an effort to grow the sport and improve the level of play In both countries after two failed attempts to send a US National team to the 2007 and 2011 CMAS World Championships. These series of North American Tournaments were used to decide the National Champion each year for the US and Canada.  Best team raked from each country was the National Champion for that year.
