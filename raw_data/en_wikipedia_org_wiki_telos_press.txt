[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Established in May 1968 by Paul Piccone and fellow students at SUNY-Buffalo with the intention of providing the New Left with a coherent theoretical perspective, the journal, which has long considered itself heterodox , has been described as turning to the right politically beginning in the 1980s.

[ 2 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] The journal's masthead lists its editor as David Tse-Chien Pan and its editor emeritus as Russell A. Berman .

[ 8 ] Piccone died of cancer in 2004 at age 64.

( December 2024 ) The journal was established by Paul Piccone and fellow working-class philosophy students in May 1968 at SUNY-Buffalo, though it was never formally associated with SUNY or any other university.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 10 ] Elisabeth K. Chaves writes that "this non-institutionalization, in academia or elsewhere, helped keep the journal distinct from other positions within the [intellectual] field, and it reveals a kinship to artists within the field of cultural production that choose to practice 'art for art's sake,' disdaining the economic and political power found at the dominant pole." [ 10 ] According to Chaves, the journal specifically saw its objective as "vindicat[ing] the ineradicability of subjectivity, the teleology of the Western project, and the possibility of regrounding such a project by means of a phenomenological and dialectical reconstitution of Marxism in conjunction with the New Left." [ 10 ] [ undue weight?

– discuss ] In this light, the journal sought to expand the Husserlian diagnosis of "the crisis of European sciences" to prefigure a particular program of social reconstruction relevant for the United States. In order to avoid the high level of abstraction typical of Husserlian phenomenology , however, the journal began introducing the ideas of Western Marxism and of the critical theory of the Frankfurt School to a North American audience.

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] In a 1971 pamphlet, in reference to its heterodoxy, members of the Chicago Surrealist Group said Telos conference organizers were "capable only of promoting the peaceful coexistence of various modes of confusion".

[ 14 ] [ independent source needed ] Poster from the Telos website describing the journal's development.

Over time, Telos became increasingly critical of the Left in general, with a reevaluation of 20th century intellectual history , including focuses on Carl Schmitt , [ 15 ] [ 2 ] federalism, and American populism through the work of Christopher Lasch .

[ citation needed ] Eventually the journal rejected the traditional divisions between Left and Right as a legitimating mechanism for new class domination and an occlusion of new, post-Fordist political conflicts—part of its critique of the New Class or professional-managerial class .

[ 16 ] This led to a reevaluation of the primacy of culture and to efforts to understand the dynamics of cultural disintegration and reintegration as a precondition for the constitution of that autonomous individuality critical theory had always identified as the telos of Western civilization.

[ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] During the journal's "conservative turn" in the 1980s, many editorial board members, including Jürgen Habermas , left Telos .

[ 2 ] [ 6 ] The academic Joan Braune writes that one cause for the resignations was Piccone's support of the United States intervention in Nicaragua .

[ 15 ] [ undue weight?

– discuss ] According to Chaves, the journal's split with Habermas was due significantly to the second generation of Critical Theory's embrace of the linguistic turn .

[ 10 ] [ undue weight?

– discuss ] The paleoconservative Paul Gottfried , a former student of Herbert Marcuse , former Republican Party activist, and critic of neoconservatism , joined Telos in the 1980s and 1990s.

[ 6 ] In January 2025, he was not listed on the journal's masthead.

[ 20 ] Advertisement for 1994 Telos conference "Populism and the New Politics" European New Right figures such as Alain de Benoist were key contributors to Telos in the 1990s.

[ 21 ] [ 22 ] Piccone asserted that the French New Right had incorporated "95 percent of standard New Left ideas".

[ 21 ] Joseph Lowndes describes Telos as "the major translator" to English of de Benoist and other New Right figures.

[ 7 ] [ 23 ] Their ethnonationalist ideas later influenced the alt-right .

[ 10 ] [ 23 ] [ 21 ] In 1994, the paleoconservative Sam Francis was a panelist at a Telos conference in New York about populism.

[ 7 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] The audience "shifted uncomfortably in their seats and chuckled in embarrassment" when Francis said the 1947 anti-austerity riots targeting Jews in England were an authentic form of populism to embrace, as recalled by Lowndes.

[ 7 ] [ 24 ] Telos had ties with figures of the paleoconservative Chronicles magazine , and was sympathetic to the Lega Nord in Italy, though Telos ' support for NATO military intervention against Serbia in 1999 to prevent ethnic cleansing was a tension with paleoconservatives.

[ 5 ] [ 7 ] Noting various criticisms, Timothy Luke , a Telos editor, described the journal in a 2005 remembrance of Piccone as "out beyond the margins of the established academy ... featuring the voices of alternative networks recruited from the contrary currents of many different intellectual traditions".

[ 26 ] [ 27 ] According to Chaves, the journal "always maintained a critical distance from any party or political movement." [ 10 ] [ undue weight?

– discuss ] Telos author John K. Bingley wrote in 2023 that "the clash of divergent opinions" is "at the core of [the journal's] identity." [ 28 ] The journal is published by Telos Press Publishing and the editor-in-chief is David Pan.

[ 29 ] It is affiliated with the Telos Institute , which hosts annual conferences, select papers from which are published in Telos .

Abstracting and indexing [ edit ] The journal is abstracted and indexed in the Social Sciences Citation Index , Arts & Humanities Citation Index , Current Contents /Social & Behavioral Sciences, and Current Contents/Arts & Humanities.

[ 30 ] According to the Journal Citation Reports , the journal has a 2023 impact factor of 0.1.

[ 31 ] Telos Press Publishing [ edit ] Telos Press Publishing was founded by Paul Piccone, the first editor-in-chief of Telos , and is the publisher of both the journal Telos as well as a separate book line. It is based in Candor, New York .
