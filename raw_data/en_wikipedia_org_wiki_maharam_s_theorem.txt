In brief, it states that every complete measure space is decomposable into "non-atomic parts" (copies of products of the unit interval [0,1] on the reals ), and "purely atomic parts," using the counting measure on some discrete space.

[ 1 ] The theorem is due to Dorothy Maharam .
It was extended to localizable measure spaces by Irving Segal .

[ 2 ] The result is important to classical Banach space theory, in that, when considering the Banach space given as an L p space of measurable functions over a general measurable space, it is sufficient to understand it in terms of its decomposition into non-atomic and atomic parts.

Maharam's theorem can also be translated into the language of abelian von Neumann algebras .  Every abelian von Neumann algebra is isomorphic to a product of σ-finite abelian von Neumann algebras, and every σ-finite abelian von Neumann algebra is isomorphic to a spatial tensor product of discrete abelian von Neumann algebras; that is, algebras of bounded functions on a discrete set .

A similar theorem was given by Kazimierz Kuratowski for Polish spaces , stating that they are isomorphic, as Borel spaces , to either the reals, the integers , or a finite set.
