( December 2012 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) The former Kneiphof Town Hall housed the Königsberg City Museum Kantiana , artifacts relating to Immanuel Kant , in the museum The Königsberg City Museum ( German : Stadtgeschichtliches Museum ) was a local museum in Königsberg , Germany .

Kneiphof Town Hall had served as the city hall for united Königsberg since 1724. In 1927 the municipal administration moved to the newer Stadthaus , leaving Kneiphof's building vacant. The respected painter Eduard Anderson led the effort to convert the former town hall into a museum, which opened in 1928 with 25 rooms. It contained portraits of Johann Georg Hamann , the Magus of the North, and Lord Mayor August Wilhelm Heidemann , as well as a bust of E. T. A. Hoffmann . It included a coin collection and examples of fine Königsberg house ceilings. Its attractions also included a banner of the Napoleonic -era East Prussian National Cavalry Regiment , a Viking sword, copper engravings, household goods, amongst other artifacts. Anderson presented lectures in the museum.

The museum also contained an exhibit of Immanuel Kant artifacts ( Kantiana ), previously located in the Königsberg Public Library . These included Kant's hat, shoe buckles, walking stick, testament, death mask, and numerous pictures and sculptures. The exhibit, which was especially popular with foreign-born Kant followers, expanded into the Kant-Museum in 1938, the same year that Fritz Gause became director of the museum.

The Nazi Party did not take an interest in the museum during Gleichschaltung . However, the Königsberg City Museum was destroyed in August 1944 during the Bombing of Königsberg in World War II .
