Euprepiophis in a Serpentarium A herpetarium is a zoological exhibition space for reptiles and amphibians , most commonly a dedicated area of a larger zoo. A herpetarium which specializes in snakes is an ophidiarium or serpentarium , which are more common as stand-alone entities also known as snake farms . Many snake farms milk snakes for venom for medical and scientific research.
