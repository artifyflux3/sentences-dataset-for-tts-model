[ 1 ] The alliance was formed as an alternative to the existing Socialist International , of which many of its member parties are former or current members.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] The Progressive Alliance claims to have 140 participants from around the world.

History [ edit ] The first step towards the creation of the Progressive Alliance was the decision in January 2012 by Sigmar Gabriel , then chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), to cancel payment of the SPD's £100,000 yearly membership fee to the Socialist International . Gabriel had been critical of the Socialist International's admittance and continuing inclusion of undemocratic political movements into the organisation.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] An initial Conference of the Progressive Alliance was held in Rome , Italy, on 14–15 December 2012, with representatives of 42 political parties attending.

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] They included Pier Luigi Bersani , leader of the Democratic Party of Italy ; Harlem Désir , Chair of the French Socialist Party ; Hermes Binner , Chair of the Argentine Socialist Party ; Peter Shumlin , Democratic governor of Vermont; and Mustapha Ben Jafar , Secretary General of the Tunisian Democratic Forum for Labour and Liberties .

[ 9 ] Also present were representatives of the Indian National Congress , the Workers' Party of Brazil, and PASOK of Greece.

[ 10 ] [ 11 ] The Dutch Labour Party also supported the formation of the organisation, [ 12 ] as did the Swiss Socialist Party , [ 13 ] and the Social Democratic Party of Austria .

[ 14 ] During the Council of the Socialist International in Cascais , Portugal, on 4–5 February 2013, 50 political parties discussed on the sidelines the formation of the Progressive Alliance, including the Movement for Democratic Change of Zimbabwe.

[ 15 ] The official foundation of the organisation was held on 22 May 2013 in Leipzig , Germany, on the 150th anniversary of the formation of the General German Workers' Association (ADAV), the predecessor of the SPD.

[ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] The organisation stated the aim of becoming the global network of "the progressive , democratic, social-democratic , socialist and labour movement".

[ 21 ] [ 22 ] It was reported that representatives of approximately 70 social-democratic political parties from across the world attended the event.

[ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] The Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D) group in the European Parliament joined the organisation upon its official foundation.

[ 26 ] Many member parties are also affiliated to the Socialist International.

[ 27 ] In September 2013 the Democratic Party of Cyprus (DIKO) announced that it was negotiating to join the Progressive Alliance and that its representatives were to attend a seminar of the international in Stockholm on 24 October.

[ 28 ] The Democratic Party of Korea was a founding member but withdrew in 2016. The Korean Justice Party currently participates as an observer.

On 4–5 December 2014, a Progressive Alliance conference was held in Lisbon for member parties of the S&D group.

[ 29 ] A regional seminar was held on 25 September 2015 in Batu Ferringhi , Malaysia, which also hosted delegates from the Democratic Action Party of Malaysia, Democratic Party of Japan and Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle .

[ 30 ] On 25 April 2016 the organisation held a seminar in São Paulo hosted by the Workers' Party of Brazil.

[ 31 ] Participants [ edit ] The Progressive Alliance lists 117 parties and 28 organisations which participate in the network, rather than claiming members.
