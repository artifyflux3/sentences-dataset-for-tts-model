This article is about any kind of extraterrestrial life. For aliens with human-like intelligence, see [Extraterrestrial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_intelligence "Extraterrestrial intelligence").

**Extraterrestrial life**, or **alien life** (colloquially, **aliens**), is [life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life "Life") that originates from another world rather than on [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth"). No extraterrestrial life has yet been scientifically conclusively detected. Such life might range from simple forms such as [prokaryotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prokaryote "Prokaryote") to [intelligent beings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_intelligence "Extraterrestrial intelligence"), possibly bringing forth [civilizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization "Civilization") that might be [far more, or far less, advanced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale "Kardashev scale") than humans.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-WP-20201231-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-NYT-20131118-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-3) The [Drake equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation "Drake equation") speculates about the existence of sapient life elsewhere in the universe. The science of extraterrestrial life is known as [astrobiology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrobiology "Astrobiology").

Speculation about the possibility of inhabited worlds beyond Earth dates back to antiquity. Early [Christian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity "Christianity") writers discussed the idea of a "plurality of worlds" as proposed by earlier thinkers such as [Democritus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democritus "Democritus"); [Augustine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo "Augustine of Hippo") references [Epicurus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicurus "Epicurus")'s idea of innumerable worlds "throughout the boundless immensity of space" in _[The City of God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_City\_of\_God "The City of God")_.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-Crowe-2008-4)

[Pre-modern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-modern "Pre-modern") writers typically assumed extraterrestrial "worlds" were inhabited by living beings. [William Vorilong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Vorilong "William Vorilong"), in the 15th century, acknowledged the possibility [Jesus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus "Jesus") could have visited extraterrestrial worlds to redeem their inhabitants.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-Crowe-2008-4): 26 [Nicholas of Cusa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_of_Cusa "Nicholas of Cusa") wrote in 1440 that Earth is "a brilliant star" like other celestial objects visible in space; which would appear similar to the [Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun "Sun"), from an exterior perspective, due to a layer of "fiery brightness" in the outer layer of the atmosphere. He theorized all extraterrestrial bodies could be inhabited by men, plants, and animals, including the Sun.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-5)[Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes "René Descartes") wrote that there were no means to prove the stars were not inhabited by "intelligent creatures", but their existence was a matter of speculation.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-Crowe-2008-4): 67

In comparison to the life-abundant Earth, the vast majority of [intrasolar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System "Solar System") and [extrasolar planets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoplanet "Exoplanet") and [moons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exomoon "Exomoon") have harsh surface conditions and disparate [atmospheric chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_chemistry "Atmospheric chemistry"), or [lack an atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exosphere#Exosphere_of_other_celestial_bodies "Exosphere").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-6) However, there are many [extreme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremophile "Extremophile") and chemically harsh ecosystems on Earth that do support forms of life and are often hypothesized to be the origin of life on Earth. Examples include life surrounding [hydrothermal vents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrothermal_vent "Hydrothermal vent"),[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-Shibuya-2022-7) acidic hot springs,[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-8) and [volcanic lakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanic_lakes "Volcanic lakes"),[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-9) as well as [halophiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halophiles "Halophiles")[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-10) and the [deep biosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_biosphere "Deep biosphere").[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-11)

Since the mid-20th century, active research has taken place to look for signs of extraterrestrial life, encompassing searches for current and historic extraterrestrial life, and a narrower [search for extraterrestrial intelligent life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_for_extraterrestrial_intelligence "Search for extraterrestrial intelligence"). [Solar system exploration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_system_exploration "Solar system exploration") has investigated conditions for life, especially on [Venus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_on_Venus "Life on Venus"), [Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_on_mars "Life on mars"), [Europa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_on_Europa "Life on Europa"), and [Titan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_on_Titan "Life on Titan"). Exoplanets were first detected in 1992. As of 14 August 2025, there are 5,983 confirmed [exoplanets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoplanet "Exoplanet") in 4,470 [planetary systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_system "Planetary system"), with 1,001 systems [having more than one planet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_multiplanetary_systems "List of multiplanetary systems").[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-NEA-12) Depending on the category of search, methods range from analysis of telescope and specimen data[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-NYT-20150106-DB-13) to radios used to detect and transmit [interstellar communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_communication "Interstellar communication").[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-14)[Interstellar travel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_travel "Interstellar travel") remains largely hypothetical, with only the [_Voyager 1_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_1 "Voyager 1") and [_Voyager 2_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_2 "Voyager 2")[probes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_probe "Interstellar probe") confirmed to have entered the [interstellar medium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_medium "Interstellar medium").

The concept of extraterrestrial life, particularly extraterrestrial intelligence, has had a major cultural impact, especially [extraterrestrials in fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrials_in_fiction "Extraterrestrials in fiction"). [Science fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction "Science fiction") has communicated scientific ideas, imagined a range of possibilities, and influenced public interest in and perspectives on extraterrestrial life. One shared space is the debate over the wisdom of attempting communication with extraterrestrial intelligence. Some encourage aggressive methods to try to contact intelligent extraterrestrial life. Others – citing the tendency of technologically advanced human societies to [enslave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery "Slavery") or destroy less advanced societies – argue it may be dangerous to actively draw attention to Earth.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-15)[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-16)

Initially, after the [Big Bang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang "Big Bang"), the universe was too hot to allow life. It is estimated that the temperature of the universe was around 10 billion K at the one second mark.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-17)[15 million years later](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronology_of_the_universe "Chronology of the universe"), it cooled to temperate levels, but the elements that make up living things did not exist yet. The only freely available elements at that point were [hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen "Hydrogen") and [helium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium "Helium"). [Carbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon "Carbon") and [oxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen "Oxygen") (and later, [water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water "Water")) would not appear until 50 million years later, created through stellar fusion. At that point, the difficulty for life to appear was not the temperature, but the scarcity of free heavy elements.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-18)[Planetary systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_system "Planetary system") emerged, and the first [organic compounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_compound "Organic compound") may have formed in the [protoplanetary disk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protoplanetary_disk "Protoplanetary disk") of [dust grains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_dust "Cosmic dust") that would eventually create rocky planets like Earth. Although Earth was in a molten state after its birth and may have burned any organics that fell in it, it would have been more receptive once it cooled down.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-19) Once the right conditions on Earth were met, life started by a chemical process known as [abiogenesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenesis "Abiogenesis"). Alternatively, life may have formed less frequently, then spread – by [meteoroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteoroid "Meteoroid"), for example – between [habitable planets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitable_planet "Habitable planet") in a process called [panspermia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panspermia "Panspermia").[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-USRA-2010-20)[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-21)

During most of its [stellar evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_evolution "Stellar evolution") stars combine hydrogen nuclei to make helium nuclei by stellar fusion, and the comparatively lighter weight of helium allows the star to release the extra energy. The process continues until the star uses all of its available fuel, with the speed of consumption being related to the size of the star. During its last stages, stars start combining helium nuclei to form carbon nuclei. The higher-sized stars can further combine carbon nuclei to create oxygen and silicon, oxygen into neon and sulfur, and so on until iron. In the end, the star blows much of its content back into the stellar medium, where it would join clouds that would eventually become new generations of stars and planets. Many of those materials are the raw components of life on Earth. As this process takes place in all the universe, said materials are ubiquitous in the cosmos and not a rarity from the Solar System.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-22)

[Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth") is a planet in the [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System "Solar System"), a planetary system formed by a star at the center, the [Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun "Sun"), and the objects that orbit it: other planets, moons, asteroids, and comets. The sun is part of the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way "Milky Way"), a [galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy "Galaxy"). The Milky Way is part of the [Local Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Group "Local Group"), a [galaxy group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_group "Galaxy group") that is in turn part of the [Laniakea Supercluster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laniakea_Supercluster "Laniakea Supercluster"). The [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe "Universe") is composed of all similar structures in existence.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-23) The immense distances between celestial objects is a difficulty for the study of extraterrestrial life. So far, humans have only set foot on the [Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon "Moon") and sent robotic probes to other planets and moons in the Solar System. Although probes can withstand conditions that may be lethal to humans, the distances cause time delays: the _[New Horizons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New\_Horizons "New Horizons")_ took nine years after launch to reach [Pluto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluto "Pluto").[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-bennett55-24) No probe has ever reached extrasolar planetary systems. The _[Voyager 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager\_2 "Voyager 2")_ has left the Solar System at a speed of 50,000 kilometers per hour, if it headed towards the [Alpha Centauri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_Centauri "Alpha Centauri") system, the closest one to Earth at 4.4 light years, it would reach it in 100,000 years. Under current technology, such systems can only be studied by telescopes, which have limitations.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-bennett55-24) It is estimated that [dark matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter "Dark matter") has a larger amount of combined matter than stars and gas clouds, but as it plays no role on the stellar evolution of stars and planets, it is usually not taken into account by astrobiology.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-25)

There is an area around a star, the [circumstellar habitable zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumstellar_habitable_zone "Circumstellar habitable zone") or "Goldilocks zone", where water may be at the right temperature to exist in liquid form at a planetary surface. This area is neither too close to the star, where water would become steam, nor too far away, where water would be frozen as ice. However, although useful as an approximation, [planetary habitability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_habitability "Planetary habitability") is complex and defined by several factors. Being in the habitable zone is not enough for a planet to be habitable, not even to actually have such liquid water. Venus is located in the habitable zone of the Solar System but does not have liquid water because of the conditions of its atmosphere. Jovian planets or [gas giants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_giant "Gas giant") are not considered habitable even if they orbit close enough to their stars as [hot Jupiters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_Jupiter "Hot Jupiter"), due to crushing atmospheric pressures.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-Neighbors-26) The actual distances for the habitable zones vary according to the type of star, and even the [solar activity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_activity "Solar activity") of each specific star influences the local habitability. The type of star also defines the time the habitable zone will exist, as its presence and limits will change along with the star's stellar evolution.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-27)

The Big Bang took place 13.8 billion years ago, the Solar System was formed 4.6 billion years ago, and the first hominids appeared 6 million years ago. Life on other planets may have started, evolved, given birth to extraterrestrial intelligences, and perhaps even faced a planetary extinction event millions or even billions of years ago. The brief times of existence of Earth's species, when considered from a cosmic perspective, may suggest that extraterrestrial life may be equally fleeting under such a scale.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-28)

During a period of about 7 million years, from about 10 to 17 million after the Big Bang, the background temperature was between 373 and 273 K (100 and 0°C; 212 and 32°F), allowing the possibility of [liquid water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_water "Liquid water") if any planets existed. [Avi Loeb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avi_Loeb "Avi Loeb") (2014) speculated that [primitive life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenesis "Abiogenesis") might in principle have appeared during this window, which he called "the Habitable Epoch of the Early Universe".[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-IJA-2014October-29)[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-NYT-20141202-30)

Life on Earth is quite ubiquitous across the planet and has adapted over time to almost all the available environments in it, [extremophiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremophile "Extremophile") and the [deep biosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_biosphere "Deep biosphere") thrive at even the most hostile ones. As a result, it is inferred that life in other celestial bodies may be equally adaptive. However, the origin of life is unrelated to its ease of adaptation and may have stricter requirements. A celestial body may not have any life on it, even if it were habitable.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-31)

Likelihood of existence
-----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Extraterrestrial_life&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Likelihood of existence")]

It is unclear if life, and more importantly, intelligent life in the cosmos is ubiquitous or rare. The hypothesis of ubiquitous extraterrestrial life relies on three main ideas. The first one, the [size of the universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Size_of_the_universe "Size of the universe") allows for plenty of planets to have a similar habitability to Earth, and the [age of the universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_universe "Age of the universe") gives enough time for a long process analog to the [history of Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Earth "History of Earth") to happen there. The second is that the chemical elements that make up life, such as carbon and water, are ubiquitous in the universe. The third is that the [physical laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_law "Physical law") are universal, which means that the forces that would facilitate or prevent the existence of life would be the same ones as on Earth.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-32) According to this argument, made by scientists such as [Carl Sagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan "Carl Sagan") and [Stephen Hawking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hawking "Stephen Hawking"), it would be improbable for life _not_ to exist somewhere else other than Earth.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-33)[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-34) This argument is embodied in the [Copernican principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copernican_principle "Copernican principle"), which states that Earth does not occupy a unique position in the Universe, and the [mediocrity principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediocrity_principle "Mediocrity principle"), which states that there is nothing special about life on Earth.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-35)

Other authors consider instead that life in the cosmos, or at least multicellular life, may be actually rare. The [Rare Earth hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_Earth_hypothesis "Rare Earth hypothesis") maintains that life on Earth is possible because of a series of factors that range from the location in the galaxy and the configuration of the [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System "Solar System") to local characteristics of the planet, and that it is unlikely that all such requirements are simultaneously met by another planet. The proponents of this hypothesis consider that very little evidence suggests the existence of extraterrestrial life and that at this point it is just a desired result and not a reasonable scientific explanation for any gathered data.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-36)[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-37)

In 1961, astronomer and astrophysicist [Frank Drake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Drake "Frank Drake") devised the [Drake equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation "Drake equation") as a way to stimulate scientific dialogue at a meeting on the [search for extraterrestrial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_for_extraterrestrial_intelligence "Search for extraterrestrial intelligence") (SETI).[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-December_2002-38)[_[better source needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTRS "Wikipedia:NOTRS")_] The Drake equation is a [probabilistic argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_theory "Probability theory") used to estimate the number of active, communicative extraterrestrial civilizations in the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way "Milky Way")[galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy "Galaxy"). The Drake equation is:

![Image 1: {\displaystyle N=R_{\ast }\cdot f_{p}\cdot n_{e}\cdot f_{\ell }\cdot f_{i}\cdot f_{c}\cdot L}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/df83ab73eacd94fd43a9136a2e7352b70e32fc5d)
where:

_N_ = the number of Milky Way galaxy civilizations already capable of communicating across [interplanetary space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interplanetary_space "Interplanetary space")
and

_R_* = the average rate of [star formation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_formation "Star formation") in [our galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way "Milky Way")_f_ _p_ = the fraction of those stars that have [planets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet "Planet")_n_ _e_ = the average number of planets that can potentially support life _f_ _l_ = the fraction of planets that actually support life _f_ _i_ = the fraction of planets with life that evolves to become [intelligent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence "Intelligence") life (civilisations)_f_ _c_ = the fraction of civilizations that develop a technology to broadcast detectable signs of their existence into space _L_ = the length of time over which such civilizations broadcast detectable signals into space
Drake's proposed estimates are as follows, but numbers on the right side of the equation are agreed as speculative and open to substitution:

![Image 2: {\displaystyle 10{,}000=5\cdot 0.5\cdot 2\cdot 1\cdot 0.2\cdot 1\cdot 10{,}000}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9fdbafc89588f7a3ee2cd08f53edd3942914018d)[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-NOVA-39)[_[better source needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTRS "Wikipedia:NOTRS")_]

The Drake equation has proved controversial since, although it is written as a math equation, none of its values were known at the time. Although some values may eventually be measured, others are based on [social sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_science "Social science") and are not knowable by their very nature.[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-Burchell-40) This does not allow one to make noteworthy conclusions from the equation.[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-41)

Based on observations from the [Hubble Space Telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope "Hubble Space Telescope"), there are nearly 2 trillion galaxies in the observable universe.[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-42) It is estimated that at least ten percent of all Sun-like stars have a system of planets,[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-marcyprogth05-43) i.e. there are 6.25×10 18 stars with planets orbiting them in the observable universe. Even if it is assumed that only one out of a billion of these stars has planets supporting life, there would be some 6.25 billion life-supporting planetary systems in the observable universe. A 2013 study based on results from the [_Kepler_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler_(spacecraft) "Kepler (spacecraft)") spacecraft estimated that the Milky Way contains at least as many planets as it does stars, resulting in 100–400 billion exoplanets.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-Swift2013-44)[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-space20130102-45) The [Nebular hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebular_hypothesis "Nebular hypothesis") that explains the formation of the Solar System and other planetary systems would suggest that those can have several configurations, and not all of them may have rocky planets within the habitable zone.[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-46)

The apparent contradiction between high estimates of the probability of the existence of extraterrestrial civilisations and the lack of evidence for such civilisations is known as the [Fermi paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox "Fermi paradox").[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-NYT-20150803-47)[Dennis W. Sciama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_W._Sciama "Dennis W. Sciama") claimed that life's existence in the universe depends on various fundamental constants. [Zhi-Wei Wang](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Zhi-Wei_Wang&action=edit&redlink=1 "Zhi-Wei Wang (page does not exist)") and [Samuel L. Braunstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_L._Braunstein "Samuel L. Braunstein") suggest that a random universe capable of supporting life is likely to be just barely able to do so, giving a potential explanation to the Fermi paradox.[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-48)

If extraterrestrial life exists, it could range from simple [microorganisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism "Microorganism") and [multicellular organisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicellular_organism "Multicellular organism") similar to animals or plants, to complex [alien intelligences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_intelligence "Alien intelligence") akin to [humans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human "Human"). When scientists talk about extraterrestrial life, they consider all those types. Although it is possible that extraterrestrial life may have other configurations, scientists use the hierarchy of lifeforms from Earth for simplicity, as it is the only one known to exist.[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-49)

The first basic requirement for life is an environment with [non-equilibrium thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-equilibrium_thermodynamics "Non-equilibrium thermodynamics"), which means that the [thermodynamic equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamic_equilibrium "Thermodynamic equilibrium") must be broken by a source of energy. The traditional sources of energy in the cosmos are the stars, such as for life on Earth, which depends on the energy of the sun. However, there are other alternative energy sources, such as [volcanoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcano "Volcano"), [plate tectonics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics "Plate tectonics"), and [hydrothermal vents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrothermal_vent "Hydrothermal vent"). There are ecosystems on Earth in deep areas of the ocean that do not receive sunlight, and take energy from [black smokers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_smoker "Black smoker") instead.[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-50)[Magnetic fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field "Magnetic field") and [radioactivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactivity "Radioactivity") have also been proposed as sources of energy, although they would be less efficient ones.[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-51)

Life on Earth requires water in a liquid state as a [solvent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solvent "Solvent") in which biochemical reactions take place. It is highly unlikely that an [abiogenesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenesis "Abiogenesis") process can start within a gaseous or solid medium: the atom speeds, either too fast or too slow, make it difficult for specific ones to meet and start chemical reactions. A liquid medium also allows the transport of nutrients and substances required for metabolism.[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-52) Sufficient quantities of carbon and other elements, along with water, might enable the formation of living organisms on [terrestrial planets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrestrial_planet "Terrestrial planet") with a chemical make-up and temperature range similar to that of Earth.[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-53)[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-54) Life based on [ammonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonia "Ammonia") rather than water has been suggested as an alternative, though this solvent appears less suitable than water. It is also conceivable that there are forms of life whose solvent is a liquid [hydrocarbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrocarbon "Hydrocarbon"), such as [methane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane "Methane"), [ethane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethane "Ethane") or [propane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propane "Propane").[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-55)

Another unknown aspect of potential extraterrestrial life would be the [chemical elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element "Chemical element") that would compose it. Life on Earth is largely composed of carbon, but there could be other [hypothetical types of biochemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothetical_types_of_biochemistry "Hypothetical types of biochemistry"). A replacement for carbon would need to be able to create complex molecules, store information required for evolution, and be freely available in the medium. To create [DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA "DNA"), [RNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA "RNA"), or a close analog, such an element should be able to bind its atoms with many others, creating complex and stable molecules. It should be able to create at least three covalent bonds: two for making long strings and at least a third to add new links and allow for diverse information. Only nine elements meet this requirement: [boron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boron "Boron"), [nitrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen "Nitrogen"), [phosphorus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorus "Phosphorus"), [arsenic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenic "Arsenic"), [antimony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimony "Antimony") (three bonds), [carbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon "Carbon"), [silicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon "Silicon"), [germanium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanium "Germanium") and [tin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin "Tin") (four bonds). As for abundance, carbon, nitrogen, and silicon are the most abundant ones in the universe, far more than the others. On [Earth's crust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_crust "Earth's crust") the most abundant of those elements is silicon, in the [Hydrosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrosphere "Hydrosphere") it is carbon and in the atmosphere, it is carbon and nitrogen. Silicon, however, has disadvantages over carbon. The molecules formed with silicon atoms are less stable, and more vulnerable to acids, oxygen, and light. An ecosystem of silicon-based lifeforms would require very low temperatures, high [atmospheric pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_pressure "Atmospheric pressure"), an atmosphere devoid of oxygen, and a solvent other than water. The low temperatures required would add an extra problem, the difficulty to kickstart a process of abiogenesis to create life in the first place.[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-56)[Norman Horowitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Horowitz "Norman Horowitz"), head of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory bioscience section for the Mariner and Viking missions from 1965 to 1976 considered that the great versatility of the [carbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon "Carbon") atom makes it the element most likely to provide solutions, even exotic solutions, to the problems of survival of life on other planets.[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-57) However, he also considered that the conditions found on [Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars "Mars") were incompatible with carbon based life.

Even if extraterrestrial life is based on carbon and uses water as a solvent, like Earth life, it may still have a radically different [biochemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry "Biochemistry"). Life is generally considered to be a product of [natural selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection "Natural selection"). It has been proposed that to undergo natural selection a living entity must have the capacity to [replicate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication "DNA replication") itself, the capacity to avoid damage/decay, and the capacity to acquire and process resources in support of the first two capacities.[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-58) Life on Earth may have started with an [RNA world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_world "RNA world") and later evolved to its current form, where some of the [RNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA "RNA") tasks were transferred to [DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA "DNA") and [proteins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteins "Proteins"). Extraterrestrial life may still be stuck using RNA, or evolve into other configurations. It is unclear if our biochemistry is the most efficient one that could be generated, or which elements would follow a similar pattern.[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-59) However, it is likely that, even if cells had a different composition to those from Earth, they would still have a [cell membrane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane "Cell membrane"). Life on Earth jumped from [prokaryotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prokaryote "Prokaryote") to [eukaryotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eukaryote "Eukaryote") and from [unicellular organisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicellular_organism "Unicellular organism") to multicellular organisms through [evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution "Evolution"). So far no alternative process to achieve such a result has been conceived, even if hypothetical. Evolution requires life to be divided into individual organisms, and no alternative organisation has been satisfactorily proposed either. At the basic level, membranes define the limit of a cell, between it and its environment, while remaining partially open to exchange energy and resources with it.[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-60)

The evolution from simple cells to eukaryotes, and from them to multicellular lifeforms, is not guaranteed. The [Cambrian explosion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambrian_explosion "Cambrian explosion") took place thousands of millions of years after the origin of life, and its causes are not fully known yet. On the other hand, the jump to multicellularity took place several times, which suggests that it could be a case of [convergent evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_evolution "Convergent evolution"), and so likely to take place on other planets as well. Palaeontologist [Simon Conway Morris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Conway_Morris "Simon Conway Morris") considers that convergent evolution would lead to kingdoms similar to our plants and animals, and that many features are likely to develop in alien animals as well, such as [bilateral symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateral_symmetry "Bilateral symmetry"), [limbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy) "Limb (anatomy)"), [digestive systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestion "Digestion") and heads with [sensory organs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensory_organ "Sensory organ").[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-AM6166-61) Scientists from the University of Oxford analysed it from the perspective of evolutionary theory and wrote in a study in the [International Journal of Astrobiology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Journal_of_Astrobiology "International Journal of Astrobiology") that aliens may be similar to humans.[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-62) The planetary context would also have an influence: a planet with higher [gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity "Gravity") would have smaller animals, and other types of stars can lead to [non-green photosynthesizers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothetical_types_of_biochemistry#Non-green_photosynthesizers "Hypothetical types of biochemistry"). The amount of energy available would also affect [biodiversity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity "Biodiversity"), as an ecosystem sustained by black smokers or hydrothermal vents would have less energy available than those sustained by a star's light and heat, and so its lifeforms would not grow beyond a certain complexity.[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-AM6166-61) There is also research in assessing the capacity of life for developing intelligence. It has been suggested that this capacity arises with the number of potential [niches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_niche "Ecological niche") a planet contains, and that the complexity of life itself is reflected in the information density of planetary environments, which in turn can be computed from its niches.[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-63)

### Harsh environmental conditions on Earth harboring life

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Extraterrestrial_life&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Harsh environmental conditions on Earth harboring life")]

It is common knowledge that the conditions on other planets in the solar system, in addition to the many galaxies outside of the [Milky Way galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way_galaxy "Milky Way galaxy"), are very harsh and seem to be too extreme to harbor any life.[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-64) The environmental conditions on these planets can have intense [UV radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UV_radiation "UV radiation") paired with extreme temperatures, lack of water,[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-65) and much more that can lead to conditions that don't seem to favor the creation or maintenance of extraterrestrial life. However, there has been much historical evidence that some of the earliest and most basic forms of life on Earth originated in some extreme environments[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-66) that seem unlikely to have harbored life at least at one point in Earth's history. Fossil evidence as well as many historical theories backed up by years of research and studies have marked environments like [hydrothermal vents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrothermal_vent "Hydrothermal vent") or acidic hot springs as some of the first places that life could have originated on Earth.[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-67) These environments can be considered extreme when compared to the typical ecosystems that the majority of life on Earth now inhabit, as hydrothermal vents are scorching hot due to the [magma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magma "Magma") escaping from the [Earth's mantle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_mantle "Earth's mantle") and meeting the much colder oceanic water. Even in today's world, there can be a diverse population of bacteria found inhabiting the area surrounding these hydrothermal vents[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-Georgieva-2021-68) which can suggest that some form of life can be supported even in the harshest of environments like the other planets in the solar system.

The aspects of these harsh environments that make them ideal for the origin of life on Earth, as well as the possibility of creation of life on other planets, is the [chemical reactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction "Chemical reaction") forming spontaneously. For example, the [hydrothermal vents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrothermal_vent "Hydrothermal vent") found on the ocean floor are known to support many [chemosynthetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemosynthesis "Chemosynthesis") processes[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-Shibuya-2022-7) which allow organisms to utilize energy through reduced chemical compounds that fix carbon.[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-Georgieva-2021-68) In return, these reactions will allow for organisms to live in relatively low oxygenated environments while maintaining enough energy to support themselves. The early Earth environment was reducing[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-69) and therefore, these carbon fixing compounds were necessary for the survival and possible [origin of life on Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_of_life_on_Earth "Origin of life on Earth"). With the little amount of information that scientists have found regarding the atmosphere on other planets in the [Milky Way galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way_galaxy "Milky Way galaxy") and beyond, the atmospheres are most likely reducing or with very low oxygen levels,[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-70) especially when compared with Earth's atmosphere. If there were the necessary elements and ions on these planets, the same carbon fixing, reduced chemical compounds occurring around hydrothermal vents could also occur on these planets' surfaces and possibly result in the origin of extraterrestrial life.

Planetary habitability in the Solar System
------------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Extraterrestrial_life&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Planetary habitability in the Solar System")]

[![Image 3](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Habitable_Worlds_2.jpg/250px-Habitable_Worlds_2.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Habitable_Worlds_2.jpg)

Besides Earth, [Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars "Mars"), [Europa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europa_(moon) "Europa (moon)") and [Enceladus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enceladus "Enceladus") are the most likely places in the Solar System to find life.

The Solar System has a wide variety of planets, dwarf planets, and moons, and each one is studied for its potential to host life. Each one has its own specific conditions that may benefit or harm life. So far, the only lifeforms found are those from Earth. No [extraterrestrial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_intelligence "Extraterrestrial intelligence") other than [humans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human "Human") exists or has ever existed within the Solar System.[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-71) Astrobiologist Mary Voytek points out that it would be unlikely to find large ecosystems, as they would have already been detected by now.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-Neighbors-26)

The inner Solar System is likely devoid of life. However, [Venus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus "Venus") is still of interest to astrobiologists, as it is a [terrestrial planet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrestrial_planet "Terrestrial planet") that was likely similar to Earth in its early stages and developed in a different way. There is a [greenhouse effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_effect "Greenhouse effect"), the surface is the hottest in the Solar System, sulfuric acid clouds, all surface liquid water is lost, and it has a thick carbon-dioxide atmosphere with huge pressure.[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-72) Comparing both helps to understand the precise differences that lead to beneficial or harmful conditions for life. And despite the conditions against [life on Venus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_on_Venus "Life on Venus"), there are suspicions that microbial life-forms may still survive in high-altitude clouds.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-Neighbors-26)

[Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars "Mars") is a cold and almost airless desert, inhospitable to life. However, recent studies revealed that [water on Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_on_Mars "Water on Mars") used to be quite abundant, forming rivers, lakes, and perhaps even oceans. Mars may have been habitable back then, and [life on Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_on_Mars "Life on Mars") may have been possible. But when the planetary core ceased to generate a magnetic field, solar winds removed the atmosphere and the planet became vulnerable to solar radiation. Ancient life-forms may still have left fossilised remains, and microbes may still survive deep underground.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-Neighbors-26)

As mentioned, the gas giants and [ice giants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_giants "Ice giants") are unlikely to contain life. The most distant solar system bodies, found in the [Kuiper Belt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuiper_Belt "Kuiper Belt") and outwards, are locked in permanent deep-freeze, but cannot be ruled out completely.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-Neighbors-26)

Although the giant planets themselves are highly unlikely to have life, there is much hope to find it on moons orbiting these planets. [Europa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europa_(moon) "Europa (moon)"), from the Jovian system, has a subsurface ocean below a thick layer of ice. [Ganymede](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganymede_(moon) "Ganymede (moon)") and [Callisto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callisto_(moon) "Callisto (moon)") also have subsurface oceans, but life is less likely in them because water is sandwiched between layers of solid ice. Europa would have contact between the ocean and the rocky surface, which helps the chemical reactions. It may be difficult to dig so deep in order to study those oceans, though. [Enceladus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enceladus "Enceladus"), a tiny moon of [Saturn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn "Saturn") with another subsurface ocean, may not need to be dug, as it releases water to space in [eruption columns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eruption_column "Eruption column"). The space probe _[Cassini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini%E2%80%93Huygens "Cassini–Huygens")_ flew inside one of these, but could not make a full study because NASA did not expect this phenomenon and did not equip the probe to study ocean water. Still, _Cassini_ detected complex organic molecules, salts, evidence of hydrothermal activity, hydrogen, and methane.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-Neighbors-26)

[Titan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_(moon) "Titan (moon)") is the only celestial body in the Solar System besides Earth that has liquid bodies on the surface. It has rivers, lakes, and rain of hydrocarbons, methane, and ethane, and even a cycle similar to Earth's [water cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_cycle "Water cycle"). This special context encourages speculations about [lifeforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_on_Titan "Life on Titan") with different biochemistry, but the cold temperatures would make such chemistry take place at a very slow pace. Water is rock-solid on the surface, but Titan does have a subsurface water ocean like several other moons. However, it is of such a great depth that it would be very difficult to access it for study.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-Neighbors-26)

The science that searches and studies life in the universe, both on Earth and elsewhere, is called [astrobiology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrobiology "Astrobiology"). With the study of Earth's life, the only known form of life, astrobiology seeks to study how life starts and evolves and the requirements for its continuous existence. This helps to determine what to look for when searching for life in other celestial bodies. This is a complex area of study, and uses the combined perspectives of several scientific disciplines, such as [astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy "Astronomy"), [biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology "Biology"), [chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry "Chemistry"), [geology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geology "Geology"), [oceanography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_oceanography "Planetary oceanography"), and [atmospheric sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_science "Atmospheric science").[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-73)

The scientific search for extraterrestrial life is being carried out both directly and indirectly. As of September 2017, 3,667 [exoplanets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoplanet "Exoplanet") in 2,747 [systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_system "Planetary system") have been [identified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoplanet "Exoplanet"), and other planets and moons in the [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System "Solar System") hold the potential for hosting primitive life such as [microorganisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism "Microorganism"). As of 8 February 2021, an updated status of studies considering the possible detection of [lifeforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifeform "Lifeform") on Venus (via [phosphine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphine "Phosphine")) and Mars (via [methane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane "Methane")) was reported.[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-NYT-20210208-74)

### Search for basic life

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Extraterrestrial_life&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Search for basic life")]

[![Image 4](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/NASA-WhatBiosignaturesDoesLifeProduce-20180625.jpg/250px-NASA-WhatBiosignaturesDoesLifeProduce-20180625.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:NASA-WhatBiosignaturesDoesLifeProduce-20180625.jpg)

Lifeforms produce a variety of biosignatures that may be detectable by telescopes.[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-NASA-20180625-75)[[76]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-EA-20180625-76)

Scientists search for [biosignatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosignature "Biosignature") within the [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System "Solar System") by studying planetary surfaces and examining [meteorites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteoroid "Meteoroid"). Some claim to have identified evidence that microbial life has existed on Mars.[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-disbelief-77)[[78]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-life-78)[[79]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-NASA-20140227-79)[[80]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-SP-20140228-80) In 1996, a controversial report stated that structures resembling [nanobacteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanobacterium "Nanobacterium") were discovered in a meteorite, [ALH84001](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALH84001 "ALH84001"), formed of [rock ejected from Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martian_meteorite "Martian meteorite").[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-disbelief-77)[[78]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-life-78) Although all the unusual properties of the meteorite were eventually explained as the result of inorganic processes, the controversy over its discovery laid the groundwork for the development of astrobiology.[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-disbelief-77)

An experiment on the two [Viking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viking_program "Viking program") Mars landers reported gas emissions from heated Martian soil samples that some scientists argue are consistent with the presence of living microorganisms.[[81]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-Chambers-81) Lack of corroborating evidence from other experiments on the same samples suggests that a non-biological reaction is a more likely hypothesis.[[81]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-Chambers-81)[[82]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-82)[[83]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-Beegle-83)[[84]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-84)

In February 2005 NASA scientists reported they may have found some evidence of extraterrestrial life on Mars.[[85]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-85) The two scientists, Carol Stoker and Larry Lemke of NASA's [Ames Research Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ames_Research_Center "Ames Research Center"), based their claim on methane signatures found in Mars's atmosphere resembling the methane production of some forms of primitive life on Earth, as well as on their own study of primitive life near the [Rio Tinto river](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Tinto_river "Rio Tinto river") in Spain. NASA officials soon distanced NASA from the scientists' claims, and Stoker herself backed off from her initial assertions.[[86]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-86)

In November 2011, NASA launched the [Mars Science Laboratory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Science_Laboratory "Mars Science Laboratory") that landed the _Curiosity_ rover on Mars. It is designed to assess the past and present habitability on Mars using a variety of scientific instruments. The rover landed on Mars at [Gale Crater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gale_(crater) "Gale (crater)") in August 2012.[[87]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-Gale_Crater2-87)[[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-Gale_Crater3-88)

A group of scientists at Cornell University started a catalog of microorganisms, with the way each one reacts to sunlight. The goal is to help with the search for similar organisms in exoplanets, as the starlight reflected by planets rich in such organisms would have a specific spectrum, unlike that of starlight reflected from lifeless planets. If Earth was studied from afar with this system, it would reveal a shade of green, as a result of the abundance of plants with photosynthesis.[[89]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-ColorCatalog-89)

In August 2011, NASA studied [meteorites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorite "Meteorite") found on Antarctica, finding [adenine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenine "Adenine"), [guanine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanine "Guanine"), [hypoxanthine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxanthine "Hypoxanthine") and [xanthine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xanthine "Xanthine"). Adenine and guanine are components of DNA, and the others are used in other biological processes. The studies ruled out pollution of the meteorites on Earth, as those components would not be freely available the way they were found in the samples. This discovery suggests that several [organic molecules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_molecules "Organic molecules") that serve as building blocks of life may be generated within asteroids and comets.[[90]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-Callahan-90)[[91]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-Steigerwald-91) In October 2011, scientists reported that [cosmic dust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_dust "Cosmic dust") contains complex [organic compounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_compound "Organic compound") ("amorphous organic solids with a mixed [aromatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromatic "Aromatic")-[aliphatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliphatic "Aliphatic") structure") that could be created naturally, and rapidly, by [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stars "Stars").[[92]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-Space-20111026-92)[[93]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-ScienceDaily-20111026-93)[[94]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-Nature-20111026-94) It is still unclear if those compounds played a role in the creation of life on Earth, but Sun Kwok, of the University of Hong Kong, thinks so. "If this is the case, life on Earth may have had an easier time getting started as these organics can serve as basic ingredients for life."[[92]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-Space-20111026-92)

In August 2012, and in a world first, astronomers at [Copenhagen University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen_University "Copenhagen University") reported the detection of a specific sugar molecule, [glycolaldehyde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycolaldehyde "Glycolaldehyde"), in a distant star system. The molecule was found around the [protostellar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protostar "Protostar") binary _[IRAS 16293-2422](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRAS\_16293%E2%88%922422 "IRAS 16293−2422")_, which is located 400 light years from Earth.[[95]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-95) Glycolaldehyde is needed to form [ribonucleic acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribonucleic_acid "Ribonucleic acid"), or RNA, which is similar in function to DNA. This finding suggests that complex organic molecules may form in stellar systems prior to the formation of planets, eventually arriving on young planets early in their formation.[[96]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-96)

In December 2023, astronomers reported the first time discovery, in the [plumes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plume_(fluid_dynamics) "Plume (fluid dynamics)") of [Enceladus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enceladus "Enceladus"), moon of the planet [Saturn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn "Saturn"), of [hydrogen cyanide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_cyanide "Hydrogen cyanide"), a possible chemical essential for [life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life "Life")[[97]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-ATL-20231205-97) as we know it, as well as other [organic molecules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_molecule "Organic molecule"), some of which are yet to be better identified and understood. According to the researchers, "these [newly discovered] compounds could potentially support extant [microbial communities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism "Microorganism") or drive complex [organic synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_synthesis "Organic synthesis") leading to the [origin of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_of_life "Origin of life")."[[98]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-NYT-20231214kc-98)[[99]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-NA-20231214-99)

[![Image 5](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Green_Bank_100m_diameter_Radio_Telescope.jpg/250px-Green_Bank_100m_diameter_Radio_Telescope.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Green_Bank_100m_diameter_Radio_Telescope.jpg)

The [Green Bank Telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bank_Telescope "Green Bank Telescope") is one of the [radio telescopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_telescope "Radio telescope") used by the [Breakthrough Listen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakthrough_Listen "Breakthrough Listen") project to search for alien communications.

Although most searches are focused on the biology of extraterrestrial life, an extraterrestrial intelligence capable enough to develop a [civilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization "Civilization") may be detectable by other means as well. Technology may generate [technosignatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technosignature "Technosignature"), effects on the native planet that may not be caused by natural causes. There are three main types of techno-signatures considered: [interstellar communications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_communication "Interstellar communication"), effects on the atmosphere, and planetary-sized structures such as [Dyson spheres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyson_sphere "Dyson sphere").[[100]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-techno-100)

Organizations such as the [SETI Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SETI_Institute "SETI Institute") search the cosmos for potential forms of communication. They started with [radio waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_waves "Radio waves"), and now search for [laser pulses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_pulse "Laser pulse") as well. The challenge for this search is that there are natural sources of such signals as well, such as gamma-ray bursts and supernovae, and the difference between a natural signal and an artificial one would be in its specific patterns. Astronomers intend to use [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence "Artificial intelligence") for this, as it can manage large amounts of data and is devoid of biases and preconceptions.[[100]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-techno-100) Besides, even if there is an advanced extraterrestrial civilization, there is no guarantee that it is transmitting radio communications in the direction of Earth. The length of time required for a signal to travel across space means that a potential answer may arrive decades or centuries after the initial message.[[101]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-101)

The atmosphere of Earth is rich in [nitrogen dioxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_dioxide "Nitrogen dioxide") as a result of [air pollution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pollution "Air pollution"), which can be detectable. The natural abundance of carbon, which is also relatively reactive, makes it likely to be a basic component of the development of a potential extraterrestrial technological civilization, as it is on Earth. [Fossil fuels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel "Fossil fuel") may likely be generated and used on such worlds as well. The abundance of [chlorofluorocarbons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorofluorocarbon "Chlorofluorocarbon") in the atmosphere can also be a clear technosignature, considering their role in [ozone depletion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone_depletion "Ozone depletion"). [Light pollution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_pollution "Light pollution") may be another technosignature, as multiple lights on the night side of a rocky planet can be a sign of advanced technological development. However, modern telescopes are not strong enough to study exoplanets with the required level of detail to perceive it.[[100]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-techno-100)

The [Kardashev scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale "Kardashev scale") proposes that a civilization may eventually start consuming energy directly from its local star. This would require giant structures built next to it, called Dyson spheres. Those speculative structures would cause an excess infrared radiation, that telescopes may notice. The infrared radiation is typical of young stars, surrounded by dusty [protoplanetary disks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protoplanetary_disk "Protoplanetary disk") that will eventually form planets. An older star such as the Sun would have no natural reason to have excess infrared radiation.[[100]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-techno-100) The presence of heavy elements in a star's light-spectrum is another potential [biosignature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosignature "Biosignature"); such elements would (in theory) be found if the star were being used as an incinerator/repository for nuclear waste products.[[102]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-102)

Some astronomers search for [extrasolar planets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoplanet "Exoplanet") that may be conducive to life, narrowing the search to [terrestrial planets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrestrial_planet "Terrestrial planet") within the habitable zones of their stars.[[103]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-Earth-likeplanet1-103)[[104]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-GlieseSpace-104) Since 1992, over four thousand exoplanets have been discovered (6,032 planets in 4,530 planetary systems including 989 [multiple planetary systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_multiplanetary_systems "List of multiplanetary systems") as of 29 July 2025).[[105]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-Encyclopaedia-105)

As of March 2014, the [least massive exoplanet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_exoplanet_extremes#Planetary_characteristics "List of exoplanet extremes") known is [PSR B1257+12 A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSR_B1257%2B12_A "PSR B1257+12 A"), which is about twice the mass of the [Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon "Moon").

Almost all of the planets detected so far are within the Milky Way, but there have also been a few possible detections of [extragalactic planets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extragalactic_planet "Extragalactic planet"). The study of [planetary habitability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_habitability "Planetary habitability") also considers a wide range of other factors in determining the suitability of a planet for hosting life.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-NYT-20150106-DB-13)

One sign that a planet probably already contains life is the presence of an atmosphere with significant amounts of [oxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen "Oxygen"), since that gas is highly reactive and generally would not last long without constant replenishment. This replenishment occurs on Earth through photosynthetic organisms. One way to analyse the atmosphere of an exoplanet is through [spectrography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrography "Spectrography") when it [transits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transit_(astronomy) "Transit (astronomy)") its star, though this might only be feasible with dim stars like [white dwarfs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_dwarf "White dwarf").[[120]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-hscfa20130225-124)

History and cultural impact
---------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Extraterrestrial_life&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: History and cultural impact")]

[![Image 7](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Epikouros_BM_1843.jpg/250px-Epikouros_BM_1843.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Epikouros_BM_1843.jpg)

The Greek [Epicurus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicurus "Epicurus") proposed that other worlds may have their own animals and plants.

The modern concept of extraterrestrial life is based on assumptions that were not commonplace during the early days of [astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_astronomy "History of astronomy"). The first explanations for the celestial objects seen in the [night sky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_sky "Night sky") were based on mythology. Scholars from [Ancient Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece "Ancient Greece") were the first to consider that the universe is inherently understandable and rejected explanations based on supernatural incomprehensible forces, such as the myth of the Sun being pulled across the sky in the chariot of [Apollo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo "Apollo"). They had not developed the [scientific method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method "Scientific method") yet and based their ideas on pure thought and speculation, but they developed precursor ideas to it, such as that explanations had to be discarded if they contradict observable facts. The discussions of those Greek scholars established many of the pillars that would eventually lead to the idea of extraterrestrial life, such as Earth being round and not flat. The cosmos was first structured in a [geocentric model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentric_model "Geocentric model") that considered that the sun and all other celestial bodies revolve around Earth. However, they did not consider them as worlds. In Greek understanding, the world was composed by both Earth and the celestial objects with noticeable movements. [Anaximander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaximander "Anaximander") thought that the cosmos was made from _[apeiron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apeiron "Apeiron")_, a substance that created the world, and that the world would eventually return to the cosmos.

Eventually two groups emerged, the _[atomists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomism "Atomism")_ that thought that matter at both Earth and the cosmos was equally made of small atoms of the [classical elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_elements "Classical elements") (earth, water, fire and air), and the _[Aristotelians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotelian\_physics "Aristotelian physics")_ who thought that those elements were exclusive of Earth and that the cosmos was made of a fifth one, the _[aether](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aether\_(classical\_element) "Aether (classical element)")_. Atomist [Epicurus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicurus "Epicurus") thought that the processes that created the world, its animals and plants should have created other worlds elsewhere, along with their own animals and plants. Aristotle thought instead that all the earth element naturally fell towards the center of the universe, and that would make it impossible for other planets to exist elsewhere. Under that reasoning, Earth was not only in the center, it was also the only planet in the universe.[[121]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-125)

Cosmic pluralism, the plurality of worlds, or simply pluralism, describes the philosophical belief in numerous "worlds" in addition to Earth, which might harbor extraterrestrial life. The earliest recorded assertion of extraterrestrial human life is found in ancient scriptures of [Jainism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jainism "Jainism"). There are multiple "worlds" mentioned in Jain scriptures that support human life. These include, among others, _Bharat Kshetra_, _Mahavideh Kshetra_, _Airavat Kshetra_, and _Hari kshetra_.[[122]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-crowe1999-126)[[123]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-127)[[124]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-Irwin-128) Medieval Muslim writers like [Fakhr al-Din al-Razi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fakhr_al-Din_al-Razi "Fakhr al-Din al-Razi") and [Muhammad al-Baqir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_al-Baqir "Muhammad al-Baqir") supported cosmic pluralism on the basis of the [Qur'an](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qur%27an "Qur'an").[[125]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-Weintraub-129)[Chaucer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Chaucer "Geoffrey Chaucer")'s poem _[The House of Fame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_House\_of\_Fame "The House of Fame")_ engaged in medieval thought experiments that postulated the plurality of worlds.[[126]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-Gabrovsky_2016_p._83-130) However, those ideas about other worlds were different from the current knowledge about the structure of the universe, and did not postulate the existence of planetary systems other than the Solar System. When those authors talk about other worlds, they talk about places located at the center of their own systems, and with their own stellar vaults and cosmos surrounding them.[[127]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-131)

The Greek ideas and the disputes between atomists and Aristotelians outlived the fall of the Greek empire. The [Great Library of Alexandria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Library_of_Alexandria "Great Library of Alexandria") compiled information about it, part of which was translated by Islamic scholars and thus survived the end of the Library. Baghdad combined the knowledge of the Greeks, the Indians, the Chinese and its own scholars, and the knowledge expanded through the [Byzantine Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Empire "Byzantine Empire"). From there it eventually returned to Europe by the time of the [Middle Ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages "Middle Ages"). However, as the Greek atomist doctrine held that the world was created by random movements of atoms, with no need for a [creator deity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creator_deity "Creator deity"), it became associated with [atheism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheism "Atheism"), and the dispute intertwined with religious ones.[[128]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-132) Still, the Church did not react to those topics in a homogeneous way, and there were stricter and more permissive views within the church itself.[[129]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-Bennet31-133)

The first known mention of the term 'panspermia' was in the writings of the 5th-century BC [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece "Ancient Greece") philosopher [Anaxagoras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaxagoras "Anaxagoras"). He proposed the idea that life exists everywhere.[[130]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-Anaxagoras-134)

### Early modern period

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Extraterrestrial_life&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Early modern period")]

[![Image 8](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Galileo_before_the_Holy_Office_-_Joseph-Nicolas_Robert-Fleury%2C_1847.png/500px-Galileo_before_the_Holy_Office_-_Joseph-Nicolas_Robert-Fleury%2C_1847.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Galileo_before_the_Holy_Office_-_Joseph-Nicolas_Robert-Fleury,_1847.png)

_Galileo before the Holy Office_, a 19th-century painting by [Joseph-Nicolas Robert-Fleury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph-Nicolas_Robert-Fleury "Joseph-Nicolas Robert-Fleury")

By the time of the [late Middle Ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Middle_Ages "Late Middle Ages") there were many known inaccuracies in the geocentric model, but it was kept in use because [naked eye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_eye "Naked eye") observations provided limited data. [Nicolaus Copernicus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Copernicus "Nicolaus Copernicus") started the [Copernican Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copernican_Revolution "Copernican Revolution") by proposing that the planets revolve around the sun rather than Earth. His proposal had little acceptance at first because, as he kept the assumption that orbits were perfect circles, his model led to as many inaccuracies as the geocentric one. [Tycho Brahe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tycho_Brahe "Tycho Brahe") improved the available data with naked-eye observatories, which worked with highly complex [sextants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sextant "Sextant") and [quadrants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrant_(instrument) "Quadrant (instrument)"). Tycho could not make sense of his observations, but [Johannes Kepler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Kepler "Johannes Kepler") did: orbits were not perfect circles, but ellipses. This knowledge benefited the Copernican model, which worked now almost perfectly. The invention of the [telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telescope "Telescope") a short time later, perfected by [Galileo Galilei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei "Galileo Galilei"), clarified the final doubts, and the [paradigm shift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm_shift "Paradigm shift") was completed.[[131]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-135) Under this new understanding, the notion of extraterrestrial life became feasible: if Earth is but just a planet orbiting around a star, there may be planets similar to Earth elsewhere. The astronomical study of distant bodies also proved that physical laws are the same elsewhere in the universe as on Earth, with nothing making the planet truly special.[[132]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-136)

The new ideas were met with resistance from the Catholic church. Galileo was [tried](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_affair "Galileo affair") for the heliocentric model, which was considered heretical, and forced to recant it.[[133]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-137) The best-known early-modern proponent of ideas of extraterrestrial life was the Italian philosopher [Giordano Bruno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giordano_Bruno "Giordano Bruno"), who argued in the 16th century for an infinite universe in which every star is surrounded by its own [planetary system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_system "Planetary system"). Bruno wrote that other worlds "have no less virtue nor a nature different to that of our earth" and, like Earth, "contain animals and inhabitants".[[134]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-138) Bruno's belief in the plurality of worlds was one of the charges leveled against him by the [Venetian Holy Inquisition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venetian_Holy_Inquisition "Venetian Holy Inquisition"), which tried and executed him.[[135]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-AM8-139)

The heliocentric model was further strengthened by the postulation of the [theory of gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_gravity "Theory of gravity") by Sir [Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton"). This theory provided the mathematics that explains the motions of all things in the universe, including planetary orbits. By this point, the geocentric model was definitely discarded. By this time, the use of the scientific method had become a standard, and new discoveries were expected to provide evidence and rigorous mathematical explanations. Science also took a deeper interest in the mechanics of natural phenomena, trying to explain not just the way nature works but also the reasons for working that way.[[136]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-140)

There was very little actual discussion about extraterrestrial life before this point, as the Aristotelian ideas remained influential while geocentrism was still accepted. When it was finally proved wrong, it not only meant that Earth was not the center of the universe, but also that the lights seen in the sky were not just lights, but physical objects. The notion that life may exist in them as well soon became an ongoing topic of discussion, although one with no practical ways to investigate.[[137]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-141)

The possibility of extraterrestrials remained a widespread speculation as scientific discovery accelerated. [William Herschel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Herschel "William Herschel"), the discoverer of [Uranus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranus "Uranus"), was one of many 18th–19th-century astronomers who believed that the [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System "Solar System") is populated by alien life. Other scholars of the period who championed "cosmic pluralism" included [Immanuel Kant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant "Immanuel Kant") and [Benjamin Franklin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin "Benjamin Franklin"). At the height of the [Enlightenment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment "Age of Enlightenment"), even the [Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun "Sun") and Moon were considered candidates for extraterrestrial inhabitants.[[138]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-142)[[139]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-143)

[![Image 9](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Lowell_Mars_channels.jpg/250px-Lowell_Mars_channels.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Lowell_Mars_channels.jpg)

Artificial Martian channels, depicted by Percival Lowell

Speculation about life on Mars increased in the late 19th century, following telescopic observation of apparent [Martian canals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martian_canals "Martian canals") – which soon, however, turned out to be optical illusions.[[140]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-144) Despite this, in 1895, American astronomer [Percival Lowell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percival_Lowell "Percival Lowell") published his book _Mars,_ followed by _Mars and its Canals_ in 1906, proposing that the canals were the work of a long-gone civilisation.[[141]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-Wallace1907-145)

[Spectroscopic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy "Spectroscopy") analysis of Mars's atmosphere began in earnest in 1894, when U.S. astronomer [William Wallace Campbell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Wallace_Campbell "William Wallace Campbell") showed that neither water nor oxygen was present in the [Martian atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martian_atmosphere "Martian atmosphere").[[142]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-chambers-146) By 1909 better telescopes and the best perihelic opposition of Mars since 1877 conclusively put an end to the canal hypothesis.[[143]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-147)

As a consequence of the belief in the [spontaneous generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_generation "Spontaneous generation") there was little thought about the conditions of each celestial body: it was simply assumed that life would thrive anywhere. This theory was disproved by [Louis Pasteur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Pasteur "Louis Pasteur") in the 19th century. Popular belief in thriving alien civilisations elsewhere in the solar system still remained strong until [Mariner 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariner_4 "Mariner 4") and [Mariner 9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariner_9 "Mariner 9") provided close images of Mars, which debunked forever the idea of the existence of Martians and decreased the previous expectations of finding alien life in general.[[144]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-148) The end of the spontaneous generation belief forced investigation into the origin of life. Although [abiogenesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenesis "Abiogenesis") is the more accepted theory, a number of authors reclaimed the term "panspermia" and proposed that life was brought to Earth from elsewhere.[[130]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-Anaxagoras-134) Some of those authors are [Jöns Jacob Berzelius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%B6ns_Jacob_Berzelius "Jöns Jacob Berzelius") (1834),[[145]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-149)[Kelvin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Thomson,_1st_Baron_Kelvin "William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin") (1871),[[146]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-150)[Hermann von Helmholtz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_von_Helmholtz "Hermann von Helmholtz") (1879)[[147]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-151) and, somewhat later, by [Svante Arrhenius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svante_Arrhenius "Svante Arrhenius") (1903).[[148]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-152)

The science fiction genre, although not so named during the time, developed during the late 19th century. The expansion of the genre of [extraterrestrials in fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrials_in_fiction "Extraterrestrials in fiction") influenced the popular perception over the real-life topic, making people eager to jump to conclusions about the discovery of aliens. Science marched at a slower pace, some discoveries fueled expectations and others dashed excessive hopes. For example, with the advent of telescopes, most structures seen on the Moon or Mars were immediately attributed to Selenites or Martians, and later ones (such as more powerful telescopes) revealed that all such discoveries were natural features.[[135]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-AM8-139) A famous case is the [Cydonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cydonia_(Mars) "Cydonia (Mars)") region of Mars, first imaged by the _[Viking 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viking\_1 "Viking 1")_ orbiter. The low-resolution photos showed a rock formation that resembled a human face, but later spacecraft took photos in higher detail that showed that there was nothing special about the site.[[149]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-153)

The search and study of extraterrestrial life became a science of its own, [astrobiology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrobiology "Astrobiology"). Also known as _exobiology_, this discipline is studied by the [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA "NASA"), the [ESA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESA "ESA"), the [INAF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INAF "INAF"), and others. Astrobiology studies life from Earth as well, but with a cosmic perspective. For example, [abiogenesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenesis "Abiogenesis") is of interest to astrobiology, not because of the origin of life on Earth, but for the chances of a similar process taking place in other celestial bodies. Many aspects of life, from its definition to its chemistry, are analyzed as either likely to be similar in all forms of life across the cosmos or only native to Earth.[[150]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-154) Astrobiology, however, remains constrained by the current lack of extraterrestrial life-forms to study, as all life on Earth comes from the same ancestor, and it is hard to infer general characteristics from a group with a single example to analyse.[[151]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-155)

The 20th century came with great technological advances, speculations about future [hypothetical technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothetical_technology "Hypothetical technology"), and an increased basic knowledge of science by the general population thanks to [science divulgation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_divulgation "Science divulgation") through the mass media. The public interest in extraterrestrial life and the lack of discoveries by mainstream science led to the emergence of [pseudosciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoscience "Pseudoscience") that provided affirmative, if questionable, answers to the existence of aliens. [Ufology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ufology "Ufology") claims that many [unidentified flying objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unidentified_flying_object "Unidentified flying object") (UFOs) would be spaceships from alien species, and [ancient astronauts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_astronauts "Ancient astronauts") hypothesis claim that aliens would have visited Earth in antiquity and prehistoric times but people would have failed to understand it by then.[[152]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-156) Most UFOs or [UFO sightings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_UFO_sightings "List of UFO sightings")[[153]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-157) can be readily explained as sightings of Earth-based aircraft (including [top-secret aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_project "Black project")), known [astronomical objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_object "Astronomical object") or weather phenomenons, or as [hoaxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoax "Hoax").[[154]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-158)

Looking beyond the pseudosciences, [Lewis White Beck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_White_Beck "Lewis White Beck") strove to elevate the level of public discourse on the topic of extraterrestrial life by tracing the evolution of philosophical thought over the centuries from ancient times into the modern era. His review of the contributions made by [Lucretius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucretius "Lucretius"), [Plutarch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutarch "Plutarch"), [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle "Aristotle"), [Copernicus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copernicus "Copernicus"), [Immanuel Kant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant "Immanuel Kant"), [John Wilkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wilkins "John Wilkins"), [Charles Darwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin "Charles Darwin") and [Karl Marx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx "Karl Marx") demonstrated that even in modern times, humanity could be profoundly influenced in its search for extraterrestrial life by subtle and comforting archetypal ideas which are largely derived from firmly held religious, philosophical and existential belief systems. On a positive note, however, Beck further argued that even if the search for extraterrestrial life proves to be unsuccessful, the endeavor itself could have beneficial consequences by assisting humanity in its attempt to actualize superior ways of living here on Earth.[[155]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-159)

By the 21st century, it was accepted that multicellular life in the Solar System can only exist on Earth, but the interest in extraterrestrial life increased regardless. This is a result of the advances in several sciences. The knowledge of planetary habitability allows to consider on scientific terms the likelihood of finding life at each specific celestial body, as it is known which features are beneficial and harmful for life. Astronomy and telescopes also improved to the point exoplanets can be confirmed and even studied, increasing the number of search places. Life may still exist elsewhere in the Solar System in unicellular form, but the advances in spacecraft allow to send robots to study samples in situ, with tools of growing complexity and reliability. Although no extraterrestrial life has been found and life may still be just a rarity from Earth, there are scientific reasons to suspect that it can exist elsewhere, and technological advances that may detect it if it does.[[156]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-160)

Many scientists are optimistic about the chances of finding alien life. In the words of SETI's Frank Drake, "All we know for sure is that the sky is not littered with powerful microwave transmitters".[[157]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-161) Drake noted that it is entirely possible that advanced technology results in communication being carried out in some way other than conventional radio transmission. At the same time, the data returned by space probes, and giant strides in detection methods, have allowed science to begin delineating [habitability criteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_habitability "Planetary habitability") on other worlds, and to confirm that at least other planets are plentiful, though aliens remain a question mark. The [Wow! signal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wow!_signal "Wow! signal"), detected in 1977 by a SETI project, remains a subject of speculative debate.[[158]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-162)

On the other hand, other scientists are pessimistic. [Jacques Monod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Monod#Philosophical_contributions "Jacques Monod") wrote that "Man knows at last that he is alone in the indifferent immensity of the universe, whence which he has emerged by chance".[[159]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-163) In 2000, geologist and [paleontologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleontologist "Paleontologist")[Peter Ward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Ward_(paleontologist) "Peter Ward (paleontologist)") and [astrobiologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrobiology "Astrobiology")[Donald Brownlee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Brownlee "Donald Brownlee") published a book entitled _[Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare\_Earth\_(book) "Rare Earth (book)")_.[[160]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-164)[_[better source needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTRS "Wikipedia:NOTRS")_] In it, they discussed the [Rare Earth hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_Earth_hypothesis "Rare Earth hypothesis"), in which they claim that Earth-like life is rare in the [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe "Universe"), whereas [microbial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria "Bacteria") life is common. Ward and Brownlee are open to the idea of evolution on other planets that is not based on essential Earth-like characteristics such as DNA and carbon.

As for the possible risks, theoretical physicist [Stephen Hawking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hawking "Stephen Hawking") warned in 2010 that humans should not try to contact alien life forms. He warned that aliens might pillage Earth for resources. "If aliens visit us, the outcome would be much as when [Columbus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Columbus "Christopher Columbus") landed in [America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas "Americas"), which didn't turn out well for the [Native Americans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas "Indigenous peoples of the Americas")", he said.[[161]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-165)[Jared Diamond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Diamond "Jared Diamond") had earlier expressed similar concerns.[[162]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-166) On 20 July 2015, Hawking and Russian billionaire [Yuri Milner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuri_Milner "Yuri Milner"), along with the [SETI Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SETI_Institute "SETI Institute"), announced a well-funded effort, called the [Breakthrough Initiatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakthrough_Initiatives "Breakthrough Initiatives"), to expand efforts to search for extraterrestrial life. The group contracted the services of the 100-meter [Robert C. Byrd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Byrd "Robert C. Byrd")[Green Bank Telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bank_Telescope "Green Bank Telescope") in West Virginia in the United States and the 64-meter [Parkes Telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkes_Telescope "Parkes Telescope") in New South Wales, Australia.[[163]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-AP-20150720-167) On 13 February 2015, scientists (including [Geoffrey Marcy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Marcy "Geoffrey Marcy"), [Seth Shostak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Shostak "Seth Shostak"), [Frank Drake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Drake "Frank Drake") and [David Brin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Brin "David Brin")) at a convention of the [American Association for the Advancement of Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Science "American Association for the Advancement of Science"), discussed [Active SETI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_SETI "Active SETI") and whether transmitting a message to possible intelligent extraterrestrials in the [Cosmos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmos "Cosmos") was a good idea;[[164]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-NYT-20150213-168)[[165]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-BBC-20150212-169) one result was a statement, signed by many, that a "worldwide scientific, political and humanitarian discussion must occur before any message is sent".[[166]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-UCB-20150213-170)

Government responses
--------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Extraterrestrial_life&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Government responses")]

The 1967 [Outer Space Treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_Space_Treaty "Outer Space Treaty") and the 1979 [Moon Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_Agreement "Moon Agreement") define rules of [planetary protection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_protection "Planetary protection") against potentially hazardous extraterrestrial life. [COSPAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COSPAR "COSPAR") also provides guidelines for planetary protection.[[167]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-171) A committee of the [United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Office_for_Outer_Space_Affairs "United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs") had in 1977 discussed for a year strategies for interacting with extraterrestrial life or intelligence. The discussion ended without any conclusions. As of 2010, the UN lacks response mechanisms for the case of an extraterrestrial contact.[[168]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-172)

One of the NASA divisions is the Office of Safety and Mission Assurance (OSMA), also known as the Planetary Protection Office. A part of its mission is to "rigorously preclude backward contamination of Earth by extraterrestrial life."[[169]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-173)

In 2016, the Chinese Government released a white paper detailing its [space program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Space_Program "Chinese Space Program"). According to the document, one of the research objectives of the program is the search for extraterrestrial life.[[170]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-174) It is also one of the objectives of the Chinese [Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-hundred-meter_Aperture_Spherical_Telescope "Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope") (FAST) program.[[171]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-175)

In 2020, [Dmitry Rogozin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitry_Rogozin "Dmitry Rogozin"), the head of the [Russian space agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roskosmos "Roskosmos"), said the search for extraterrestrial life is one of the main goals of deep space research. He also acknowledged the possibility of existence of primitive life on other planets of the Solar System.[[172]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-176)

The [French space agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNES "CNES") has an office for the study of "non-identified aero spatial phenomena".[[173]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-newscientist.com-177)[[174]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-178) The agency is maintaining a publicly accessible database of such phenomena, with over 1600 detailed entries. According to the head of the office, the vast majority of entries have a mundane explanation; but for 25% of entries, their extraterrestrial origin can neither be confirmed nor denied.[[173]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-newscientist.com-177)

In 2020, chairman of the [Israel Space Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Space_Agency "Israel Space Agency")[Isaac Ben-Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Ben-Israel "Isaac Ben-Israel") stated that the probability of detecting life in outer space is "quite large". But he disagrees with his former colleague [Haim Eshed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haim_Eshed "Haim Eshed") who stated that there are contacts between an advanced alien civilisation and some of Earth's governments.[[175]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-179)

[![Image 13](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/Grey_Aliens_Drawing.jpg/250px-Grey_Aliens_Drawing.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Grey_Aliens_Drawing.jpg)

[Grey aliens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_alien "Grey alien") are a common way to depict extraterrestrials in fiction.

Although the idea of extraterrestrial peoples became feasible once astronomy developed enough to understand the nature of planets, they were not thought of as being any different from humans. Having no scientific explanation for the [origin of mankind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_of_mankind "Origin of mankind") and its relation to other species, there was no reason to expect them to be any other way. This was changed by the 1859 book _[On the Origin of Species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On\_the\_Origin\_of\_Species "On the Origin of Species")_ by [Charles Darwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin "Charles Darwin"), which proposed the [theory of evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_evolution "Theory of evolution"). Now with the notion that evolution on other planets may take other directions, [science fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction "Science fiction") authors created bizarre aliens, clearly distinct from humans. A usual way to do that was to add body features from other animals, such as insects or octopuses. Costuming and special effects feasibility alongside budget considerations forced films and TV series to tone down the fantasy, but these limitations lessened since the 1990s with the advent of [computer-generated imagery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-generated_imagery "Computer-generated imagery") (CGI), and later on as CGI became more effective and less expensive.[[176]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-early-180)

Real-life events sometimes captivate people's imagination and this influences the works of fiction. For example, during the [Barney and Betty Hill incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barney_and_Betty_Hill_incident "Barney and Betty Hill incident"), the first recorded claim of an [alien abduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_abduction "Alien abduction"), the couple reported that they were abducted and experimented on by aliens with oversized heads, big eyes, pale grey skin, and small noses, a description that eventually became the [grey alien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_alien "Grey alien") archetype once used in works of fiction.[[176]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life#cite_note-early-180)
