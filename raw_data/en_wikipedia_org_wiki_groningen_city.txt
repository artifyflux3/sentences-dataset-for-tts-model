Dubbed the "capital of the north", Groningen is the largest place as well as the economic and cultural centre of the northern part of the country; [ 7 ] [ 8 ] as of January 2025, it had 244,807 inhabitants, [ 9 ] making it the sixth largest city/municipality in the Netherlands and the second largest outside the Randstad . The Groningen metropolitan area has a population of over 360,000.

Groningen was established more than 980 years ago but never gained city rights . Due to its relatively isolated location from the then successive Dutch centres of power ( Utrecht , The Hague , Brussels ), Groningen was historically reliant on itself and nearby regions. As a Hanseatic city, it was part of the North German trade network, but later it mainly became a regional market centre. At the height of its power in the 15th century, Groningen could be considered an independent city-state and it remained autonomous until the late 18th century, when it was incorporated into the Napoleonic Batavian Republic .

[ 10 ] Today Groningen is a university city, home to some of the country's leading higher education institutes; University of Groningen ( Rijksuniversiteit Groningen ), which is the Netherlands's second oldest university, and Hanze University of Applied Sciences ( Hanzehogeschool Groningen ).

[ 11 ] Students comprise an estimated 25% of its total population, making it the country's demographically youngest city.

[ 12 ] Etymology [ edit ] The origin and meaning of 'Groningen' and its older variant, 'Groeningen', are uncertain. A folk origin story relates the idea that, in 453 BC, exiles from Troy who were guided by a mythical figure called Gruno (or Grunius, Gryns or Grunus), along with a group of Phrygians from Germany, founded a settlement in what is now Groningen, and built a castle on the bank of the Hunze , which they called 'Grunoburg', and which was later destroyed by the Vikings.

[ 13 ] [ 14 ] One modern theory is that 'Groningen' meant 'among the people of Groni' ('Groningi' and 'Groninga' in the 11th century), derived from Gronesbeke , which was the old name for a small lake near the Hunze (on the northern border of Zuidlaarderveen ).

[ 15 ] As the name Grone (variant Groene) is an old Frisian personal name, the origin may very well be in a settlement originally founded by the family of Grone and their followers, which in Frisian would be called Groninga. Another theory is that the name was derived from the word groenighe , meaning 'green fields'.

[ 14 ] In Frisian , it is called Grins .

[ 16 ] In Groningen province , it is called Groot Loug [ nl ] . Regionally, it is often simply referred to as Stad (the "city"), [ 17 ] [ 18 ] and its inhabitants are referred to as Stadjers or Stadjeder .

[ 19 ] The Dutch sometimes refer to it as "the Metropolis of the North", [ 20 ] or Martinistad (after the Martinitoren tower).

[ 20 ] History [ edit ] For a chronological guide, see Timeline of Groningen .

The city was founded at the northernmost point of the Hondsrug area.

[ 21 ] While the oldest document referring to Groningen's existence dates from 1040, the area was occupied by Anglo-Saxons centuries prior.

[ 22 ] The oldest archaeological evidence of a settlement in the region stems from around 3950–3650 BC, [ 23 ] and the first major settlement in Groningen trace back to the year 3 AD.

[ 24 ] Martini Tower Groningen in the 16th century In the 13th century Groningen was an important trade centre and its inhabitants built a city wall to underline its authority.

[ 25 ] The city had a strong influence on its surrounding lands and the Gronings dialect became common.

[ 26 ] The city's most influential period was at the end of the 15th century, when the nearby province of Friesland was administered from Groningen.

[ 27 ] During these years the Martinitoren was built which is considered to be the city's most significant landmark.

[ 28 ] In 1536, Groningen accepted Emperor Charles V , the King of Spain and the Habsburg ruler of the other Netherlands as its ruler, thus ending the region's autonomy.

[ 29 ] The city was captured in the Siege of Groningen (1594) by the Dutch and English forces led by Maurice of Nassau .

[ 30 ] After the siege, the city and the province joined the Dutch Republic .

[ 31 ] During the 17th century, Groningen served as a crucial hub for the Dutch West India Company (WIC). This powerful trading company was responsible for maritime trade, colonization, and the transportation of goods and people.

The WIC transported over 300,000 slaves from the African coast to the Dutch colonies between 1621 and 1792. Warships like the Groeningen sailed from Groningen's shipyards to Africa's west coast, carrying enslaved Africans to plantations in Brazil, Suriname, and the Antilles.

[ 32 ] These same ships returned to Europe laden with valuable commodities such as sugar, coffee, and tobacco.

The University of Groningen was founded in 1614 with initial course offerings in law, medicine, theology and philosophy.

[ 33 ] During this period the city expanded rapidly and a new city wall was built.

[ 34 ] Siege of Groningen by Bishop of Münster in 1672 The Siege of Groningen (1672) led by the bishop of Münster , Bernhard von Galen , during the Third Anglo-Dutch War failed and the city walls resisted; [ 35 ] an event that is celebrated annually with music and fireworks on 28 August as " Gronings Ontzet [ nl ] " or " Bommen Berend " ("Bombing Bernard").

[ 36 ] [ 37 ] In the early 19th century when the kingdom of Holland under king Jerôme Bonaparte was founded, Groningen was integrated into the French system of administration, and then annexed in 1811 into the French Empire under emperor Napoleon I (until 1813). During the French administration of the area, Groningen was called Groningue .

[ 38 ] During World War II , the main square and the Grote Markt were largely destroyed in the Battle of Groningen in April 1945.

[ 34 ] However, the church Martinitoren , the Goudkantoor , and the city hall were undamaged.

[ 39 ] Geography [ edit ] There is a town named after Groningen in Saramacca District , Suriname, a former Dutch colony. It was named after the hometown of Dutch governor-general of Suriname Jan Wichers , who established the town as a fort in 1790.

Canals [ edit ] Numerous canals ( grachten ) surround the city, locally called diep . The major canals that travel from the city are the Van Starkenborgh Canal , Eems Canal , and Winschoterdiep. Groningen's canals, no longer used for commercial goods transport, were once vital hubs in trade and transport. The rivers crossing close to the Binnenstad have been used for trade for at least a thousand years [ nl ] . The Dutch West India Company and foreign investors established their Groningen headquarters in Reitemakersrijge. Additional warehouses were strategically built along the canals at Noorderhaven to store colonial produce.

[ 32 ] These warehouses often held goods obtained from plantations in the Dutch colonies.

Climate [ edit ] Groningen has an oceanic temperate climate, like all of the Netherlands, although slightly colder in winter than other major cities in the Netherlands due to its northeasterly position.

[ 40 ] Weather is influenced by the North Sea to the north-west and its prevailing north-western winds and gales.

[ 41 ] Summers are somewhat warm and humid.

[ 42 ] Temperatures of 30 °C (86 °F) or higher occur sporadically; the average daytime high is around 22 °C (72 °F). Very rainy periods are common, especially in spring and summer. Average annual precipitation is about 800 mm (31 in). Annual sunshine hours vary, but are usually below 1600 hours, giving much cloud cover similar to most of the Netherlands. Climate in this area has mild differences between highs and lows, and there is adequate rainfall year-round. The Köppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is " Cfb ". (Marine West Coast Climate/ Oceanic climate ).

[ 43 ] Winters are cool; on average above freezing, although frosts are common during spells of easterly winds.

[ 44 ] Night-time temperatures of −10 °C (14 °F) or lower are not uncommon during cold winter periods. The lowest temperature ever recorded is −26.8 °C (−16.2 °F) on 16 February 1956. Snow often falls, but rarely stays long due to warmer daytime temperatures, although white snowy days happen every winter.

[ 113 ] Similar to most Dutch cities , Groningen has developed to accommodate a large number of cyclists.

[ 114 ] An extensive network of bike paths were planned to make it more convenient to cycle to various destinations instead of taking a car.

[ 115 ] The city has segregated cycle-paths, public transport, and a large pedestrianised zone in the city centre.

[ 116 ] Groningen's city centre was remodeled into a "pedestrian priority zone" to promote walking and biking.

[ 117 ] This was achieved by applying the principle of filtered permeability —the network configuration favours active transportation and selectively "filters out" traveling in a car by reducing the number of streets that run through the centre.

[ 118 ] The streets that are discontinuous for cars connect to a network of pedestrian and bike paths which permeate the entire centre.

[ 119 ] In addition, these paths go through public squares and open spaces, increasing aesthetic appeal and encouraging participation.

[ 120 ] The logic of filtering a mode of transport is fully expressed in a comprehensive model for laying out neighbourhoods and districts—the fused grid .
