An extension of Kraken Mare enters the view at upper left.

Feature type Lacus Coordinates 73°N 336°W ﻿ / ﻿ 73°N 336°W ﻿ / 73; -336 Diameter 240 km [ note 1 ] Eponym Jingpo Lake Jingpo Lacus is a lake in the north polar region of Titan , [ 1 ] the planet Saturn 's largest moon. It and similarly sized Ontario Lacus [ 2 ] are the largest known bodies of liquid on Titan after the three maria ( Kraken Mare , Ligeia Mare , and Punga Mare ).

[ 3 ] It is composed of liquid hydrocarbons (mainly methane and ethane ). It is west of Kraken Mare at 73° N, 336° W, roughly 240 km (150 mi) long, [ 1 ] [ note 1 ] similar to the length of Lake Onega on Earth . Its namesake is Jingpo Lake , [ 1 ] a lake in China.

Specular reflection [ edit ] On 8 July 2009, Cassini' s Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) observed a specular reflection in 5 μm infrared light off Jingpo Lacus at 71° N, 337° W. (This has sometimes been described less accurately as at the southern shoreline of Kraken Mare.

[ 4 ] ) Specular reflections indicate a smooth, mirror-like surface, so the observation corroborated the inference of the presence of a large liquid body drawn from radar imaging. The observation was made soon after the north polar region emerged from 15 years of winter darkness.
