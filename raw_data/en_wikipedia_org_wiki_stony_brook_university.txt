Along with the University at Buffalo , it is one of the State University of New York system's two flagship institutions .

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] Its campus consists of 213 buildings on over 1,454 acres (588 hectares) of land in Suffolk County and it is the largest public university (by area) in the state of New York.

[ 11 ] Opened 68 years ago in  1957 in Oyster Bay as the State University College on Long Island , the institution moved to Stony Brook in 1962.

[ 1 ] [ 12 ] Stony Brook is part of the Association of American Universities and the Universities Research Association .

[ 13 ] It is classified among "R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity".

[ 14 ] Stony Brook University, in partnership with Battelle , manages Brookhaven National Laboratory , a national laboratory of the United States Department of Energy . The university acquired land for a Research & Development Park adjacent to its main campus in 2004, and has four business incubators across the region. Stony Brook is the largest single-site employer on Long Island; over 25,500 students are enrolled at the university, which has over 15,000 employees and over 2,850 faculty.

[ 15 ] Stony Brook is a member of the Coastal Athletic Association , and its intercollegiate athletic teams have competed at the Division I level of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) since 1999.

[ 16 ] History [ edit ] Origins in Oyster Bay [ edit ] Coe Hall on the original Oyster Bay campus (used 1957–1964) The State University of New York at Stony Brook was established in Oyster Bay in 1957, as the State University College on Long Island ( SUCOLI ). Established almost a decade after the creation of New York's public higher education system, the institution was envisioned as a college for the preparation of secondary school teachers.

[ 17 ] Leonard K. Olson was appointed as the first dean of the institution [ 18 ] and was instrumental in the recruitment of faculty staff and planning of the later Stony Brook campus. SUCOLI opened with an inaugural class of 148 students, [ 17 ] [ 19 ] on the grounds of the William Robertson Coe Planting Fields estate. These first students were admitted on a tuition-free basis.

1961 was a year of firsts as 30 students were conferred degrees in the first commencement [ 20 ] and the university was appointed its first president, John Francis Lee .

[ 18 ] Lee left later that year due to political and bureaucratic matters regarding the future of the university and the central administration at Albany.

[ 21 ] [ 22 ] Nevertheless, he had fulfilled his primary task of reshaping the university from a technical science and engineering college of limited degree options to a full-scale university featuring liberal arts programs.

[ 23 ] Move to Stony Brook [ edit ] In 1960 the Heald Report, [ 24 ] commissioned by Governor Nelson Rockefeller , recommended a major new public university be built on Long Island to "stand with the finest in the country," a report that would ultimately shape most of the university's growth [ 25 ] for years to come.

The Staller Center for the Arts on the Stony Brook campus Ward Melville , a philanthropist and businessman from the Three Village area in western Suffolk County donated over 400 acres (160 hectares) of land to the state for the development of a state university [ 19 ] and in 1962 the institution relocated to Stony Brook [ 22 ] and officially renamed as the State University of New York at Stony Brook. However, the longer name has fallen out of favor; since 2005, it has usually been called simply Stony Brook University (SBU).

[ 26 ] The campus had 782 students enrolled in 1962, but enrollment had increased more than tenfold by 1969, surpassing the 8,000 mark, [ 27 ] fueled by the large funding of public higher education in the Sputnik era. In 1963, only three years after the release of the Heald Report, the Governor commissioned the "Education of Health Professions" (Muir Report) report.

[ 28 ] The report outlined the need for expansion of the university system to prepare medical professionals for the future needs of the state.

[ 28 ] The report was particularly important for Stony Brook as it recommended creation of a Health Sciences Center and academic hospital at the campus to serve the need of the fastest-growing counties (Nassau and Suffolk) in New York at the time.

[ 28 ] Growth [ edit ] Atrium of the Frank Melville Jr. Memorial Library In 1965, the State University appointed John S. Toll , a physicist from the University of Maryland as the second president of Stony Brook.

[ 22 ] In 1966, the university set forth initial timetables for the development of the Health Sciences Center, which would house the university's health programs and hospital . Despite the budgetary concerns and challenges from Albany, the university released a formalized plan early in 1968 and funding for recruitment of faculty was provided. At the same time, residential housing was expanded to 3,000, the Stony Brook Union opened in 1970, and in 1971, the massive expansion project for the campus library (named in memory of Frank Melville Jr., father of philanthropist Ward Melville ) was completed.

Despite the fast-paced growth, campus infrastructure often struggled to keep pace: overcrowding, [ 29 ] expansion, [ 30 ] landscaping, lighting, and safety were persistent problems at the university, which led to multiple protests and growing tension between the student body and the administration. In January 1968, the infamous "Operation Stony Brook" drug raid resulted in the arrest of 29 students, and in the fall of 1968, tension climaxed as the administration and students decided on a three-day moratorium to bring together the entire university with the goal of improving communication between the students, faculty, and administration.

[ 21 ] Stony Brook University Hospital , located on the east side of campus and attached to the Health Sciences Center The 1970s witnessed the growth of the university and its transformation as a major research institution within New York's public school system, with strong graduate programs and scientific breakthroughs like the development of magnetic resonance imaging .

[ 31 ] But the university lagged significantly in undergraduate education, prioritizing graduate education and research over undergraduate studies and student life. By 1975, enrollment had reached 16,000 and expansion crossed over Nicolls Road with the construction of the Health Sciences Center, which would be completed in 1980.

In 1981, John Marburger was inaugurated as the third president, and continued the expansion. By the late 1980s, the administration affirmed the need to improve other areas of the institution, which included undergraduate education, student and residential life, and intercollegiate athletics. In 1994, the university approved a decision to transition athletics to the Division I of the NCAA by 1999 and followed with the construction of the Stony Brook Arena and the expansion of the Indoor Sports Complex.

[ 32 ] Further expansion into the 21st century [ edit ] The 1990s affirmed Stony Brook's success at building a research university with a strong undergraduate education. Under the leadership of its fourth president, Shirley Strum Kenny , the administration sought out to showcase the value of the institution. Kenny was responsible for campus wide improvement projects, which included large-scale landscaping, renovations of every residence hall, the continued growth of the athletics programs, the improvement of student life, ever-increasing research expenditures, a branding/marketing campaign, and the university's increasing ties with private philanthropy.

In the mid-1990s, the school began to distance itself from the SUNY system, as Kenny believed that the SUNY name was hurting the school's reputation.

[ 33 ] In 1998, the university became one of the top 100 American research universities in the U.S. News & World Report . That same year, the university and Battelle Memorial Institute were chosen by the Department of Energy as joint operators of the Brookhaven National Laboratory, joining a selective group of universities that operate national laboratories across the nation. Enrollment reached the 20,000 mark in 2001, and the administration's improvement efforts climaxed with the invitation to the highly selective Association of American Universities , an organization of North American universities committed to a strong system of research and education.

[ 34 ] The Charles B. Wang Center is dedicated to Asian and American cultural studies.

2002 saw the opening of the $22 million Kenneth P. LaValle Stadium and the inauguration of the massive Charles B. Wang Center dedicated to Asian and American culture, funded by a $50 million donation from Charles B. Wang. At the time, it was the largest private donation to a SUNY institution.

[ 35 ] In 2003, chemistry professor Paul Lauterbur received a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his research and discovery of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, which was instrumental in the development of NMR Imaging (MRI) while at Stony Brook. In 2005, the university bought the Flowerfield property adjacent to campus through eminent domain as land for the development of a Research and Development Park. Plans for a law school were in the talks but scrapped shortly after.

In 2009, president Shirley Strum Kenny stepped down, and in May, Samuel L. Stanley was announced as Stony Brook's fifth president. The late 2000s saw the university receive historic philanthropic donations. Hedge funder Jim Simons made multiple multi-million donations, including a $25 million donation to the Stony Brook Foundation in 2006, a $60 million donation for the development of the Simons Center for Geometry and Physics in 2008, and a landmark $150 million donation to the university in 2011.

[ 36 ] Other major donations were provided by alumni Joe Nathan , Stuart Goldstein , and Glenn Dubin for major renovation of athletic facilities. In 2010, Stanley announced Project 50 Forward, a comprehensive plan for the development of the university in the next 50 years with a focus on "operational excellence, academic greatness, and building for the future." East Side Dining facility attached to Chavez and Tubman residence halls In 2012, the $40 million Walter J. Hawrys Campus Recreation Center opened, [ 37 ] soon followed by the on-campus Hilton Garden Inn in May 2013.

[ 38 ] Frey Hall, named after alumnus Robert Frey, opened in 2013 after undergoing renovations as the former Old Chemistry building.

[ 39 ] The Stony Brook University Arena underwent a $21 million overhaul, re-opening as the Island Federal Arena in 2014.

[ 40 ] In July 2015, a new $40.8 million Computer Science building opened, spanning 70,000 square feet (6,500 m 2 ).

[ 41 ] New dormitories, known as Chavez Hall and Tubman Hall, along with a new East Side Dining hall, opened in the fall of 2016.

[ 42 ] In January 2019, Stony Brook Medicine opened their $194 million cancer center to the public.

[ 43 ] President Stanley left Stony Brook effective August 1, 2019, to become the president of Michigan State University following the Larry Nassar scandal .

[ 44 ] Provost Michael A. Bernstein was named interim president in his place.

[ 45 ] On March 26, 2020, Maurie McInnis , the executive vice president and provost of the University of Texas , was named the sixth president of Stony Brook, effective July 1, 2020.

[ 46 ] During the COVID-19 pandemic , the United States Army constructed $50 million temporary field hospitals on the campus of Stony Brook University.

[ 47 ] [ 48 ] However, the beds were dismantled in 2021 without ever being used.

[ 49 ] A $63.4 million renovation of the Stony Brook Union was completed during the pandemic and opened in 2020.

[ 50 ] Flagship status era [ edit ] On January 5, 2022, New York Governor Kathy Hochul officially designated Stony Brook University and the University at Buffalo as the two flagship universities of the State University of New York system.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] The announcement came with the dedication of a new $100 million multidisciplinary engineering building.

[ 51 ] About three weeks later, Stony Brook announced its departure from the America East Conference after 21 years to the Colonial Athletic Association , effective July 1, 2022.

[ 52 ] Later that year, distinguished professor Dennis Sullivan earned the 2022 Abel Prize , the top honor in mathematics.

[ 53 ] In the 2022–23 edition of the U.S. News & World Report national college rankings, Stony Brook was ranked 77th, its highest-ever placement, as well as the first time that Stony Brook held sole possession of the highest-ranked public university in New York.

[ 54 ] [ 55 ] It advanced to 58th the following year.

[ 56 ] In April 2023, Stony Brook University was selected as the anchor institution for a new $700 million, 172-acre climate change research and education hub on Governors Island in New York City, set to open in 2028.

[ 57 ] [ 58 ] Two months later, the university received a $500 million unrestricted gift from the Simons Foundation , the second-largest gift to a public university in U.S. history.

[ 59 ] [ 60 ] McInnis stepped down in May 2024 to become the president at Yale University , and former Rutgers president Richard L. McCormick was named interim president.

[ 61 ] [ 62 ] In February 2025, Princeton dean of engineering and applied science Andrea Goldsmith was named SBU's seventh president.

[ 63 ] Campuses [ edit ] Main article: Campus of Stony Brook University Main campus [ edit ] Stony Brook Union The main campus is in the area of the historic North Shore hamlet of Stony Brook near the geographic midpoint of Long Island , approximately 50 miles (80 km) east of Manhattan and 62 miles (100 km) [ 64 ] west of Montauk . Bounded to the north by New York State Route 25A (North Country Road), the campus is subdivided into "West Campus" and "East Campus" by the thoroughfare County Road 97 (Nicolls Road). The Ashley Schiff Forest Preserve separates the South Campus from West Campus. The Long Island Rail Road serves the community with the Stony Brook station situated along the northern edge of the campus.

The Stony Brook University campus area is a census-designated place (CDP), [ 65 ] with a population of 10,409 at the 2020 census .

[ 66 ] As of the 2020 census, the U.S. Census Bureau defines the Stony Brook University CDP as a census-designated place separate from the CDP of Stony Brook.

[ 67 ] The municipality containing the university is Town of Brookhaven .

[ 65 ] The university is not located in a village .

West [ edit ] The Academic Mall is the central feature of West Campus.

The West Campus is the center of the academic life of the university. It houses the majority of academic, athletic, and undergraduate student housing facilities while also being the original site of the university.

The modern campus is centered around the Academic Mall, which stretches for more than a quarter of a mile from the Simons Center for Geometry and Physics at the west end to the Administration Building at the east end. The Academic Mall includes the Student Activities Center , Frank Melville Jr. Memorial Library , Staller Center for the Arts , Humanities building, Psychology A & B, Harriman Hall, Frey Hall (previously known as Old Chemistry), the Earth and Space Sciences building, Math Tower, and Physics building.

View toward the Chemistry Building The Engineering Quad is located near the Academic Mall, and contains the Engineering, Light Engineering, Heavy Engineering, and Computing Center facilities. The Javits Lecture Center, Social and Behavioral Sciences building, Computer Science building, New Computer Science building and Student Union facilities are also on the West Campus. The Life Sciences complex, also on the West Campus, consists of the Life Sciences building, Laufer Center for Physical and Quantitative Biology, Centers for Molecular Medicine, Bioengineering building, and the Institute for Advanced Computational Science.

Earth and Space Sciences building Among the latest additions to the campus are the Simons Center for Geometry and Physics, the new Walter J. Hawrys Campus Recreation Center, the Hilton Garden Inn hotel, Frey Hall, and a new Computer Science building. The Staller Center , which contains the largest movie screen in Suffolk County on Long Island , holds the annual Stony Brook Film Festival .

The athletic facilities are in the northwest quadrant of West Campus, which include the Stony Brook Sports Complex , Island Federal Credit Union Arena , Kenneth P. LaValle Stadium , Joe Nathan Field , University Track , and University Field.

South [ edit ] The South Campus is about half a mile south of the Academic Mall and separated from West Campus by the Ashley Schiff Forest Preserve. It is home to the School of Dental Medicine, the School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences (SoMAS), the Cody Center for Autism and Developmental Disabilities, and the University Police headquarters.

Research and development [ edit ] The Research and Development Park is on Stony Brook Road, a mile from the center of campus. On November 3, 2005, the university announced it had formally acquired 246 acres (100 hectares) of the adjacent Flowerfield property, originally owned by the St. James Gyrodyne Company of America , through eminent domain , three years after the university had expressed its desire to acquire the property.

[ 68 ] Stony Brook is using this property as a Research and Development Park, similar to other university-affiliated science parks around the country. The campus will ultimately house ten new buildings. The first building, the Center of Excellence in Wireless and Information Technology (CEWIT), was completed in October 2008. CEWIT houses the world's first (and currently the largest) immersive gigapixel facility in the world, called the Reality Deck.

[ 69 ] In 2019, Stony Brook University celebrated the opening of its new SMART Cluster [ 70 ] in CEWIT, a dual-use GPU cluster for both machine learning and visualization. The SMART Cluster is also the first hardware-accelerated ray-tracing cluster for real-time cinematic quality rendering, allowing scientists, engineers and physicians to visualize huge amounts of data in a new way. Construction for the Advanced Energy Research and Technology Center, designed by Flad Architects , commenced in the summer of 2008 and opened in the spring of 2010.

East [ edit ] Stony Brook University Hospital at the East Campus The East Campus is separated from the main campus by Nicolls Road (County Road 97). It is home to the Stony Brook University Hospital and the Health Sciences Center. Stony Brook University Hospital, completed in 1980, is Suffolk County's only tertiary hospital and Level 1 Trauma Center, and the only academic medical center in Suffolk County—larger also than any in Nassau County.

[ 71 ] The hospital is the largest in Suffolk County, and the attached Health Sciences Center (HSC) and Basic Science Tower (BST) houses numerous laboratories, the School of Medicine (1972), the School of Nursing (1970), the School of Health Professions (1970) and the School of Social Welfare (1971). The area also includes the Ambulatory Surgery Center and the Center for Outpatient Services.

[ 72 ] Construction on the Medical and Research Translation (MART) building began in November 2013, and the 240,000 square foot building opened on November 1, 2018, with its $194 million cost funded by state grants and donations from Jim Simons.

[ 73 ] [ 74 ] The MART building is the home to the Stony Brook Cancer Center.

[ 75 ] In November 2019, Stony Brook Medicine opened a four-story, $73 million expansion to the Stony Brook Children's Hospital.

[ 76 ] [ 77 ] Also in the east side of campus are the Chapin apartments, which provide housing for graduate students. The Long Island High Technology Incubator, one of the four business incubators of the university, is a short walk north of the hospital. The Long Island State Veterans Home serving the Long Island veteran community is in this part of campus.

Manhattan campus [ edit ] Main article: Stony Brook Manhattan In 2002, the university established a presence in Manhattan with the opening of Stony Brook Manhattan . The original site was at 401 Park Avenue South; a newer operation opened in late 2008 in the adjacent building on the third floor of 387 Park Avenue South. The university consolidated operations in 2011 to just the 3rd floor of 387 Park Avenue South, with a classroom entrance around the corner at 101 East 27th Street. The 18,000-square-foot (1,700 m 2 ) site allows Stony Brook to offer professional and graduate courses targeted towards students in New York City ; undergraduate courses are held primarily during the summer and winter sessions. Conferences and special events take place throughout the year. In February 2017 however, the lease for this campus was terminated, and there are no classes offered at this location.

Southampton campus [ edit ] Main article: Stony Brook Southampton The Southampton Windmill is a prominent feature of the Southampton campus.

On March 24, 2006, the university completed the purchase of the 81-acre (33-hectare) Southampton College (on the east end of Long Island) property from Long Island University with the intent to develop it as a full college campus focusing on academic programs related to the environment and sustainability.

[ 78 ] Stony Brook expanded its original program, started in Fall 2005, when it offered an undergraduate marine sciences program, with teaching and research facilities at the campus leased from Long Island University. An enrollment of about 2,000 students is expected within the next five years. Professor Martin Schoonen was appointed interim dean of Southampton campus on August 3, 2006, and conservationist Mary Pearl was appointed dean and vice president in March 2009.

On April 7, 2010, the university had suspended residential programs and transferred sustainability programs to the main campus.

[ 79 ] The change was prompted by severe state budget cuts. Although the Marine Sciences and Graduate Writing programs are still in session at Southampton, undergraduates were relocated to the main campus. As a result of the suspension of residential programs, all dining services and retail operations were suspended by the Faculty Student Association. The old LIU radio station and National Public Radio affiliate no longer operate on the campus.

In September 2011, Stony Brook Southampton began offering an undergraduate program called Semester by the Sea, where students attend undergraduate classes to study the ocean or the arts. Students studying the ocean are immersed in marine topics that are enhanced with close proximity to the water, a fleet of research vessels and graduate research projects that are ongoing. Students studying the arts are engaged in studies for filmmaking and creative writing. Both programs offer a Public Lecture Series.

As of 2015, the Stony Brook Southampton campus has shown growth, despite almost being closed down in 2010. Programs had been added back, and the board of trustees of the State University of New York approved a long-awaited partnership agreement between Southampton and Stony Brook University hospitals. Enrollment increased to over 400, after being around 175, three years following the addition of new funding.

[ 80 ] As of 2019, Stony Brook University operates the Stony Brook Southampton Hospital with plans to take ownership of more eastern Long Island hospitals.

[ 81 ] South Korea [ edit ] SBU at SUNY Korea Stony Brook University has operations in Incheon , South Korea as part of the Incheon Global Campus (IGC). The other schools involved include George Mason University , the University of Utah , Ghent University and the Fashion Institute of Technology .

[ 82 ] In July 2011, Stanley announced that the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology in South Korea approved the establishment of SUNY Korea as part of Songdo International Business District in Incheon .

[ 83 ] The campus was expected to begin academic programs in March 2012 with an enrollment of 200.

[ 84 ] As of 2021, the student body contained roughly 1,000 students from over 40 countries. Its president is Arthur H. Lee, who was appointed to the role effective January 1, 2022. Stony Brook University students are allowed to apply for an exchange program at SUNY Korea, while SUNY Korea students are required to take a year of classes at Stony Brook University.

[ 85 ] Beginning in 2017, FIT joined Stony Brook in offering degree programs at SUNY Korea.

[ 86 ] [ 87 ] Art on campus [ edit ] Stony Brook University has four gallery spaces on campus. As was the desire of donor Paul W. Zuccaire, the Paul W. Zuccaire Gallery, formerly known as the University Art Gallery, showcases professional exhibitions as well as annual graduate and undergraduate student works. The Paul W. Zuccaire Gallery is in the Staller Center for the Arts.

Also on campus is the Latin American and Caribbean Studies Center's Art Gallery, which features works from Latino and Latin American artists as well as local artists who fall under that category. The SAC Art Gallery is a center for interactive and participatory art projects.

The Tabler Center for Arts, Culture, and Humanities includes an art gallery and blackbox theater performance space. The Simons Center for Geometry and Physics includes an art gallery as well.

Organization and administration [ edit ] College/school founding College/school Year founded College of Arts and Sciences 1990 [ 88 ] College of Business 2004 College of Engineering and Applied Sciences 1960 [ 89 ] School of Dental Medicine 1968 [ 90 ] School of Health Professions - School of Journalism 2006 [ 91 ] School of Marine & Atmospheric Sciences 2007 [ 92 ] School of Nursing - School of Medicine 1980 [ 93 ] School of Professional Development - School of Social Welfare 1970 [ 94 ] The Graduate School - Administration Building The Stony Brook University consists of a main campus in Stony Brook, and additional satellite campuses in Southampton and South Korea . The university is composed of 12 schools and colleges. By enrollment, the largest college or school is the College of Arts and Sciences.

The university is governed by the State University of New York board of trustees, a body of 18 members, which regulate all the individual units of the SUNY system. The trustees have the authority to appoint the president of each state-operated institution; grant all degree diplomas and certificates for the completion of studies at any state-operated campus; and regulate admissions, tuition, curricula, and all other matters pertaining to the operation and administration of each state-operated campus. The president of Stony Brook is the principal executive officer of the university. The position was first held by John Francis Lee and is held by the seventh president in the institution's history, Andrea Goldsmith , who took office on August 1, 2025.

Endowment [ edit ] Stony Brook's financial endowment is managed by the Stony Brook Foundation. The foundation was established in 1965 as a not-for-profit corporation under the New York State Education Law, [ 22 ] chartered to collect and manage gifts from private and non-state resources to supplement the funding of the university and managed by a voluntary board of trustees.

[ 22 ] Donations can be made to a wide selection of funds which benefit different areas of the university.

In 2012, the endowment was valued at approximately $125 million with total assets amounting to nearly $350 million and has fully recovered from the losses endured in the 2008 economic downturn.

[ 95 ] After a strong fundraising campaign led by Jim Simon's $150 million donation, the university's fundraising amounted to more than $180 million for the 2011–12 year and raised $200 million by March 2013.

[ 96 ] It is the second largest endowment among State University of New York university centers behind the University at Buffalo . However, the university's endowment remains far below the average of its Association of American Universities peers.

On June 1, 2023, The Simons Foundation announced a historic $500 million endowment gift, making it the largest unrestricted donation to an institution of higher education in U.S. history.

[ 97 ] Student government [ edit ] Housed in the Student Activities Center, the Undergraduate Student Government (USG) is the governing body representing the undergraduate students of the university. The main functions of USG involve regulation, funding, and recognizing official clubs and organizations of the university. Undergraduate students are obligated to pay a Student Activity Fee per semester which is then administered by the Undergraduate Student Government. USG manages the yearly Homecoming events, Roth Pond Regatta and the traditional end-of-the year Brookfest concert and a series of concerts and events branded as "Stony Brook Concerts" that occur throughout the academic year while also directly funding undergraduate organizations, clubs, and other student services. USG at Stony Brook has a long history going back to the founding of the Student Polity Association (Polity) in 1959. After the controversial de-certification of Polity by the administration in 2002, USG was founded in 2003.

Like USG, the Graduate Student Organization (GSO) is the governing body representing the graduate students of the university. The GSO advocates for graduate student interests to senior university administration and is part of shared governance at the university.

[ 98 ] Graduate students pay a per-semester activity fee which is used to fund events and programs for the graduate community. The GSO provides services for graduate students including funding for conferences, seminars, speaker events, travel to Brookhaven and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories, funding for social events, departmental organizations, and student clubs.

[ 99 ] The GSO hosts social events, professional development programming, and free legal and tax clinics. Traditional events hosted by the GSO include graduate student orientation, Three Minute Thesis , an annual speaker event, and national conferences. The GSO co-manages the University Cafe. GSO executive board members partake in national advocacy, and work with organizations such as the National Association of Graduate-Professional Students (NAGPS) on advocating for higher education policy issues.

[ 100 ] Academics [ edit ] Umbilic Torus in front of the Math Tower and Physics building Stony Brook was one of ten national universities awarded a National Science Foundation recognition award in 1998 for their integration of research and education.

[ 101 ] Between 2005 and 2007, two Nobel Prizes were awarded to professors for their work conducted at Stony Brook.
