( August 2008 ) The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC; French : Commission électrotechnique internationale ) is an international standards organization that prepares and publishes international standards for all electrical , electronic and related technologies. IEC standards cover a vast range of technologies within electrotechnology.

The numbers of older IEC standards were converted in 1997 by adding 60000; for example IEC 27 became IEC 60027. IEC standards often have multiple sub-part documents; only the main title for the standard is listed here.
