Education and career [ edit ] Hoddeson received in 1957 a high school diploma from the Bronx High School of Science , in 1961 a bachelor's degree in physics from Barnard College , and in 1966 a Ph.D. in physics from Columbia University with a dissertation on solid-state physics. She was an assistant professor of physics from 1967 to 1970 at Barnard College and from 1971 to 1976 at Rutgers University . In 1974–1975 she was a visiting fellow at Princeton University and took Thomas Kuhn 's "History of Quantum Mechanics" graduate course.

[ 2 ] From  1977 to 1992 she held various academic positions at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign , before becoming there an associate professor from 1993 to 2000 and a full professor from 2000 until her retirement. Since 1978 she has held the position of Fermilab 's historian.

Hoddeson is the co-author or editor of several books and has published more than 50 articles in referred journals.

[ 3 ] Her publications include a biography of John Bardeen , history of the development of the transistor, history of Fermilab, technical history of the beginning of Los Alamos National Laboratory , and history of the development of the atomic bomb in the Manhattan Project . She co-authored three important books on the history of particle physics and a 2015 book on the Superconducting Super Collider .

In 2012 she received the Abraham Pais Prize for History of Physics from the American Physical Society .

[ 4 ] She was a Guggenheim Fellow for the academic year 2000–2001 [ 5 ] and is a Fellow of the American Physical Society.

[ 6 ] She was married to physicist Gordon Baym from 1981 to 1992.
