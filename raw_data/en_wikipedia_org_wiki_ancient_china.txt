This article is about the general history of China from prehistoric times to the present. For the history of the Republic of China from 1912 to 1949, see [History of the Republic of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Republic_of_China "History of the Republic of China"). For the history of the People's Republic of China since 1949, see [History of the People's Republic of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China "History of the People's Republic of China").

The **history of China** spans several millennia across a wide geographical area. Each region now considered part of the Chinese world has experienced periods of unity, fracture, prosperity, and strife. Chinese civilization first emerged in the [Yellow River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_River "Yellow River") valley, which along with the [Yangtze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangtze_River "Yangtze River") basin constitutes the geographic core of the [Chinese cultural sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinosphere "Sinosphere"). China maintains a rich diversity of ethnic and linguistic people groups. The [traditional lens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_historiography "Chinese historiography") for viewing Chinese history is the [dynastic cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynasties_of_China "Dynasties of China"): imperial dynasties rise and fall, and are ascribed certain achievements. This lens also tends to assume Chinese civilization can be traced as an unbroken thread [many thousands of years into the past](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_thousand_years_of_Chinese_civilization "Five thousand years of Chinese civilization"), making it one of the [cradles of civilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cradle_of_civilization "Cradle of civilization"). At various times, states representative of a dominant Chinese culture have directly controlled areas stretching as far west as the [Tian Shan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tian_Shan "Tian Shan"), the [Tarim Basin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarim_Basin "Tarim Basin"), and the [Himalayas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himalayas "Himalayas"), as far north as the [Sayan Mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayan_Mountains "Sayan Mountains"), and as far south as the [delta of the Red River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_River_Delta "Red River Delta").

The [Neolithic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic_China "Neolithic China") period saw increasingly complex polities begin to emerge along the [Yellow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_river_civilization "Yellow river civilization") and [Yangtze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangtze_civilization "Yangtze civilization") rivers. The [Erlitou culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlitou_culture "Erlitou culture") in the [central plains of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhongyuan "Zhongyuan") is sometimes identified with the [Xia dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xia_dynasty "Xia dynasty") (3rd millennium BC) of traditional [Chinese historiography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_historiography "Chinese historiography"). The earliest surviving [written Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Written_Chinese "Written Chinese") dates to roughly 1250 BC, consisting of divinations inscribed on [oracle bones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_bone "Oracle bone"). [Chinese bronze inscriptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_bronze_inscriptions "Chinese bronze inscriptions"), ritual texts dedicated to ancestors, form another large corpus of early Chinese writing. The earliest strata of received literature in Chinese include [poetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_of_Poetry "Classic of Poetry"), [divination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yi_Jing "Yi Jing"), and [records of official speeches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shang_Shu "Shang Shu"). China is believed to be one of a very few loci of independent invention of writing, and the earliest surviving records display an already-mature written language. The [culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_China "Culture of China") remembered by the earliest [extant literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_literature "Chinese literature") is that of the [Zhou dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhou_dynasty "Zhou dynasty") (c. 1046– 256 BC), China's [Axial Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_Age "Axial Age"), during which the [Mandate of Heaven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandate_of_Heaven "Mandate of Heaven") was introduced, and foundations laid for philosophies such as [Confucianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confucianism "Confucianism"), [Taoism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taoism "Taoism"), [Legalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legalism_(Chinese_philosophy) "Legalism (Chinese philosophy)"), and _[Wuxing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuxing\_(Chinese\_philosophy) "Wuxing (Chinese philosophy)")_.

China was [first united](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qin%27s_wars_of_unification "Qin's wars of unification") under a single imperial state by [Qin Shi Huang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qin_Shi_Huang "Qin Shi Huang") in 221 BC. [Orthography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthography "Orthography"), weights, measures, and law were all standardized. Shortly thereafter, China entered its classical era with the [Han dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_dynasty "Han dynasty") (202 BC– 220 AD), marking a critical period. A term for the Chinese language is still "Han language", and the dominant Chinese ethnic group is known as [Han Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Chinese "Han Chinese"). The Chinese empire reached some of its farthest geographical extents during this period. Confucianism was officially sanctioned and its [core texts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Books_and_Five_Classics "Four Books and Five Classics") were edited into their received forms. Wealthy landholding families independent of the ancient aristocracy began to wield significant power. Han technology can be considered on par with that of the contemporaneous [Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire "Roman Empire"): mass production of paper aided the proliferation of written documents, and the written language of this period was employed for millennia afterwards. China became known internationally for its [sericulture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sericulture "Sericulture"). When the Han imperial order finally collapsed after four centuries, China entered an equally lengthy period of disunity, during which [Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism "Buddhism") began to have a significant impact on Chinese culture, while [calligraphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_calligraphy "Chinese calligraphy"), art, historiography, and storytelling flourished. Wealthy families in some cases became more powerful than the central government. The Yangtze River valley was incorporated into the dominant cultural sphere.

A period of unity began in 581 with the [Sui dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sui_dynasty "Sui dynasty"), which soon gave way to the long-lived [Tang dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tang_dynasty "Tang dynasty") (608–907), regarded as another Chinese golden age. The Tang dynasty saw flourishing developments in science, technology, poetry, economics, and geographical influence. China's only officially recognized empress, [Wu Zetian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_Zetian "Wu Zetian"), reigned during the dynasty's first century. Buddhism was adopted by Tang emperors. "Tang people" is the other common demonym for the Han ethnic group. After the Tang fractured, the [Song dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song_dynasty "Song dynasty") (960–1279) saw the maximal extent of imperial Chinese cosmopolitan development. [Mechanical printing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_printing_in_East_Asia "History of printing in East Asia") was introduced, and many of the earliest surviving witnesses of certain texts are [wood-block prints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodblock_printing "Woodblock printing") from this era. Song scientific advancement led the world, and the [imperial examination system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_examination_system "Imperial examination system") gave ideological structure to the political bureaucracy. Confucianism and Taoism were fully knit together in [Neo-Confucianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Confucianism "Neo-Confucianism").

Eventually, the [Mongol Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_Empire "Mongol Empire") conquered all of China, establishing the [Yuan dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuan_dynasty "Yuan dynasty") in 1271. Contact with Europe began to increase during this time. Achievements under the subsequent [Ming dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ming_dynasty "Ming dynasty") (1368–1644) include [global exploration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ming_treasure_voyages "Ming treasure voyages"), fine [porcelain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_ceramics "Chinese ceramics"), and many extant public works projects, such as those restoring the [Grand Canal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Canal_(China) "Grand Canal (China)") and [Great Wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Wall_of_China "Great Wall of China"). Three of the four [Classic Chinese Novels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_Chinese_Novels "Classic Chinese Novels") were written during the Ming. The [Qing dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qing_dynasty "Qing dynasty") that succeeded the Ming was ruled by ethnic [Manchu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchu "Manchu") people. The [Qianlong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qianlong "Qianlong") emperor (r. 1735–1796) commissioned [a complete encyclopaedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siku_Quanshu "Siku Quanshu") of imperial libraries, totaling nearly a billion words. Imperial China reached its greatest territorial extent of during the Qing, but China came into increasing conflict with European powers, culminating in the [Opium Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opium_Wars "Opium Wars") and subsequent [unequal treaties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unequal_treaties "Unequal treaties").

The 1911 [Xinhai Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinhai_Revolution "Xinhai Revolution"), led by [Sun Yat-sen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Yat-sen "Sun Yat-sen") and others, created the [Republic of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_China_(1912%E2%80%931949) "Republic of China (1912–1949)"). From 1927 to 1949, a [costly civil war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Civil_War "Chinese Civil War") roiled between the Republican government under [Chiang Kai-shek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiang_Kai-shek "Chiang Kai-shek") and the Communist-aligned [Chinese Red Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Red_Army "Chinese Red Army"), interrupted by the industrialized [Empire of Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_of_Japan "Empire of Japan") invading the divided country until its defeat in the Second World War.

After the [Communist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_China "Communist Party of China") victory, [Mao Zedong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mao_Zedong "Mao Zedong") proclaimed the establishment of the [People's Republic of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_China "People's Republic of China") (PRC) in 1949, with the ROC retreating to Taiwan. Both governments still claim sole legitimacy of the entire mainland area. The PRC has slowly accumulated the majority of diplomatic recognition, and Taiwan's status remains disputed to this day. From 1966 to 1976, the [Cultural Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Revolution "Cultural Revolution") in mainland China helped consolidate Mao's power towards the end of his life. After his death, the government began [economic reforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_economic_reform "Chinese economic reform") under [Deng Xiaoping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deng_Xiaoping "Deng Xiaoping"), and became the world's [fastest-growing major economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_real_GDP_growth_rate "List of countries by real GDP growth rate").[_[when?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual\_of\_Style/Dates\_and\_numbers#Chronological\_items "Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers")_] China had been the most populous nation in the world for decades since its unification, until it was surpassed by [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India "India") in 2023.

The [archaic human](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaic_human "Archaic human") species of _[Homo erectus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo\_erectus "Homo erectus")_ arrived in [Eurasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasia "Eurasia") sometime between 1.3 and 1.8 [million years ago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Million_years_ago "Million years ago") (Ma) and numerous remains of its subspecies have been found in what is now China.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWilkinson2018737-1) The oldest of these is the southwestern [Yuanmou Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuanmou_Man "Yuanmou Man") (元谋人; in [Yunnan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yunnan "Yunnan")), dated to c. 1.7 Ma, which lived in a mixed [bushland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushland "Bushland")-forest environment alongside [chalicotheres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chalicothere "Chalicothere"), [deer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deer "Deer"), the elephant _[Stegodon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stegodon "Stegodon")_, [rhinos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhino "Rhino"), cattle, pigs, and the [giant short-faced hyena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_short-faced_hyena "Giant short-faced hyena").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-FOOTNOTEZhuPottsPanYao20081077,_1084%E2%80%931085-2) The better-known [Peking Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peking_Man "Peking Man") (北京猿人; near Beijing) of 700,000–400,000 [BP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Present "Before Present"),[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWilkinson2018737-1) was discovered in the [Zhoukoudian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhoukoudian "Zhoukoudian") cave alongside [scrapers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scraper_(archaeology) "Scraper (archaeology)"), [choppers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chopper_(archaeology) "Chopper (archaeology)"), and, dated slightly later, points, [burins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burin_(lithic_flake) "Burin (lithic flake)"), and awls.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWuLin198392-3) Other _Homo erectus_ fossils have been found widely throughout the region, including the northwestern [Lantian Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lantian_Man "Lantian Man") in [Shaanxi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaanxi "Shaanxi"), as well minor specimens in northeastern [Liaoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liaoning "Liaoning") and southern [Guangdong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong "Guangdong").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWilkinson2018737-1) The dates of most [Paleolithic sites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Paleolithic_sites_in_China "List of Paleolithic sites in China") were long debated but have been more reliably established based on modern [magnetostratigraphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetostratigraphy "Magnetostratigraphy"): Majuangou at 1.66–1.55 Ma, Lanpo at 1.6 Ma, [Xiaochangliang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiaochangliang "Xiaochangliang") at 1.36 Ma, Xiantai at 1.36 Ma, [Banshan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banshan "Banshan") at 1.32 Ma, Feiliang at 1.2 Ma and Donggutuo at 1.1 Ma.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAoDekkersWeiQiang20131-4) Evidence of fire use by _Homo erectus_ occurred between 1–1.8 million years BP at the archaeological site of [Xihoudu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xihoudu "Xihoudu"), Shanxi Province.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-FOOTNOTEJamesDennellGilbertLewis19892-5)

The circumstances surrounding the [evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_evolution "Human evolution") of _Homo erectus_ to contemporary _[H. sapiens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.\_sapiens "H. sapiens")_ is debated; the three main theories include the dominant ["Out of Africa" theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recent_African_origin_of_modern_humans "Recent African origin of modern humans") (OOA), the [regional continuity model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_continuity_model "Regional continuity model") and the admixture variant of the OOA hypothesis.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWilkinson2018737-1) Regardless, the earliest modern humans have been dated to China at 120,000–80,000 BP based on fossilized teeth discovered in [Fuyan Cave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuyan_Cave "Fuyan Cave") of [Dao County](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dao_County "Dao County"), Hunan.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-FOOTNOTELiuMartin%C3%B3n-TorresCaiXing2015696-6) The larger animals which lived alongside these humans include the extinct _[Ailuropoda baconi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ailuropoda\_baconi "Ailuropoda baconi")_ panda, the _[Crocuta ultima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crocuta "Crocuta")_ hyena, the _Stegodon_, and the [giant tapir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_tapir "Giant tapir").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-FOOTNOTELiuMartin%C3%B3n-TorresCaiXing2015696-6) Evidence of [Middle Palaeolithic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Palaeolithic "Middle Palaeolithic")[Levallois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levallois_technique "Levallois technique") technology has been found in the lithic assemblage of [Guanyindong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanyindong "Guanyindong") Cave site in southwest China, dated to approximately 170,000–80,000 years ago.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHuMarwickZhangRui201882-7)

The [Neolithic Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic_Age "Neolithic Age") in China is considered to have begun about 10,000 years ago.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-neolithic_period_in_china-8) Because the Neolithic is conventionally defined by the presence of agriculture, it follows that the Neolithic began at different times in the various regions of what is now China. Agriculture in China developed gradually, with initial domestication of a few grains and animals gradually expanding with the addition of many others over subsequent millennia.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-:0-9) The earliest evidence of cultivated rice, found by the Yangtze River, was carbon-dated to 8,000 years ago.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-Pringle-10) Early evidence for [millet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millet "Millet") agriculture in the Yellow River valley was [radiocarbon-dated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiocarbon_dating "Radiocarbon dating") to about 7000 BC.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-11) The [Jiahu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiahu "Jiahu") site is one of the best preserved early agricultural villages (7000 to 5800 BC). At [Damaidi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damaidi "Damaidi") in Ningxia, 3,172 [cliff carvings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic_signs_in_China "Neolithic signs in China") dating to 6000–5000 BC have been discovered, "featuring 8,453 individual characters such as the sun, moon, stars, gods and scenes of hunting or grazing", according to researcher Li Xiangshi. Written symbols, sometimes called [proto-writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-writing "Proto-writing"), were found at the site of Jiahu, which is dated around 7000 BC,[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-earliest_writing-12) Damaidi around 6000 BC, [Dadiwan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dadiwan_culture "Dadiwan culture") from 5800 BC to 5400 BC,[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-13) and [Banpo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banpo "Banpo") dating from the 5th millennium BC. With agriculture came increased population, the ability to store and redistribute crops, and the potential to support specialist craftsmen and administrators, which may have existed at late Neolithic sites like [Taosi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taosi "Taosi") and the [Liangzhu culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liangzhu_culture "Liangzhu culture") in the Yangtze delta.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-Pringle-10) The cultures of the middle and late Neolithic in the central Yellow River valley are known, respectively, as the [Yangshao culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangshao_culture "Yangshao culture") (5000 BC to 3000 BC) and the [Longshan culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longshan_culture "Longshan culture") (3000 BC to 2000 BC). Pigs and dogs were the earliest-domesticated animals in the region, and after about 3000 BC domesticated cattle and sheep arrived from Western Asia. Wheat also arrived at this time but remained a minor crop. Fruit such as [peaches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peaches "Peaches"), [cherries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherries "Cherries") and [oranges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_(fruit) "Orange (fruit)"), as well as chickens and various vegetables, were also domesticated in Neolithic China.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-:0-9)

### Bronze Age

Map of tribes and tribal unions in Ancient China, including the tribes led by the [Yellow Emperor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_Emperor "Yellow Emperor"), [Emperor Yan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Yan "Emperor Yan") and [Chiyou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiyou "Chiyou").

Bronze artifacts have been found at the [Majiayao culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majiayao_culture "Majiayao culture") site (between 3100 and 2700 BC).[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-14)[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-15) The Bronze Age is also represented at the [Lower Xiajiadian culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_Xiajiadian_culture "Lower Xiajiadian culture") (2200–1600 BC)[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-16) site in northeast China. [Sanxingdui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanxingdui "Sanxingdui") located in what is now [Sichuan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sichuan "Sichuan") is believed to be the site of a major ancient city, of a previously unknown Bronze Age culture (between 2000 and 1200 BC). The site was first discovered in 1929 and then re-discovered in 1986. Chinese archaeologists have identified the Sanxingdui culture to be part of the [state of Shu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Shu "State of Shu"), linking the artifacts found at the site to its early legendary kings.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBagley1999135-17)[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-18) The graves at Mogou revealed a high level of [violence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prehistoric_warfare "Prehistoric warfare") in the [Qijia culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qijia_culture "Qijia culture").[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-19)

[Ferrous metallurgy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrous_metallurgy "Ferrous metallurgy") begins to appear in the late 6th century in the [Yangtze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangtze "Yangtze") valley.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-Higham-20) A bronze hatchet with a blade of [meteoric iron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteoric_iron "Meteoric iron") excavated near the city of [Gaocheng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaocheng_District "Gaocheng District") in [Shijiazhuang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shijiazhuang "Shijiazhuang") (now [Hebei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebei "Hebei")) has been dated to the 14th century BC. An Iron Age culture of the [Tibetan Plateau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibetan_Plateau "Tibetan Plateau") has tentatively been associated with the [Zhang Zhung culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhang_Zhung_culture "Zhang Zhung culture") described in early Tibetan writings.

Ancient China
-------------

Chinese historians in later periods were accustomed to the notion of one dynasty succeeding another, but the political situation in early China was much more complicated. Hence, as some scholars of China suggest, the Xia and the Shang can refer to political entities that existed concurrently, just as the early Zhou existed at the same time as the Shang.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-21) This bears similarities to how China, both contemporaneously and later, has been divided into states that were not one region, legally or culturally.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-22)

The earliest period once considered historical was the legendary era of the sage-emperors [Yao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Yao "Emperor Yao"), [Shun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Shun "Emperor Shun"), and [Yu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yu_the_Great "Yu the Great"). Traditionally, the [abdication system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdication_system "Abdication system") was prominent in this period,[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-23) with Yao yielding his throne to Shun, who abdicated to Yu, who founded the Xia dynasty.

### Xia dynasty (c. 2070 – c. 1600 BC)

Decorative plaque from the [Erlitou culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlitou_culture "Erlitou culture")

The [Xia dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xia_dynasty "Xia dynasty") (c. 2070– c. 1600 BC) is the earliest of the three dynasties described in much later traditional historiography, which includes the _[Bamboo Annals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamboo\_Annals "Bamboo Annals")_ and [Sima Qian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sima_Qian "Sima Qian")'s _[Shiji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiji "Shiji")_ (c. 91 BC). The Xia is generally considered mythical by Western scholars, but in China it is usually associated with the early Bronze Age site at [Erlitou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlitou "Erlitou") (1900–1500 BC) in Henan that was excavated in 1959. Since no writing was excavated at Erlitou or any other contemporaneous site, there is not enough evidence to prove whether the Xia dynasty ever existed. Some archaeologists claim that the Erlitou site was the capital of the Xia.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-24) In any case, the site of Erlitou had a level of political organization that would not be incompatible with the legends of Xia recorded in later texts.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-25) More importantly, the Erlitou site has the earliest evidence for an elite who conducted rituals using cast bronze vessels, which would later be adopted by the Shang and Zhou.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBagley1999158%E2%80%93159-26)

### Shang dynasty (c. 1600 – c. 1046 BC)

[![Image 9](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/HouMuWuDingFullView.jpg/250px-HouMuWuDingFullView.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:HouMuWuDingFullView.jpg)

The 12th-century BC [Houmuwu _ding_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houmuwu_ding "Houmuwu ding"), the largest [Bronze Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Age "Bronze Age") bronzeware found anywhere in the world

Both archaeological evidence like oracle bones and bronzes, as well as transmitted texts attest the historical existence of the Shang dynasty (c. 1600– c. 1046 BC). Findings from the earlier Shang period come from excavations at [Erligang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erligang "Erligang") (modern [Zhengzhou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhengzhou "Zhengzhou")). Findings have been found at [Yinxu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yinxu "Yinxu") (near modern [Anyang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anyang "Anyang"), Henan), the site of the final Shang capital during the [Late Shang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Shang "Late Shang") period (c. 1250–1050 BC).[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWilkinson2018756-27) The findings at Anyang include the earliest written record of the Chinese so far discovered: inscriptions of divination records in ancient Chinese writing on the bones or shells of animals—the [oracle bones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_bone "Oracle bone"), dating from c. 1250– c. 1046 BC.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBoltz1986436-28)

A series of at least twenty-nine kings reigned over the Shang dynasty.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKeightley1999232-29) Throughout their reigns, according to the _Shiji_, the capital city was moved six times.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKeightley1999233-30) The final and most important move was to [Yin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yinxu "Yinxu") during the reign of [Wu Ding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_Ding "Wu Ding")c. 1250 BC.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-31) The term Yin dynasty has been synonymous with the Shang dynasty in history, although it has lately been used to refer specifically to the latter half of the Shang dynasty.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKeightley1999232-29)

Although written records found at Anyang confirm the existence of the Shang dynasty,[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-32) Western scholars are often hesitant to associate settlements that are contemporaneous with the Anyang settlement with the Shang dynasty. For example, archaeological findings at [Sanxingdui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanxingdui "Sanxingdui") suggest a technologically advanced civilization culturally unlike Anyang. The evidence is inconclusive in proving how far the Shang realm extended from Anyang. The leading hypothesis is that Anyang, ruled by the same Shang in the official history, coexisted and traded with numerous other culturally diverse settlements in the area that is now referred to as [China proper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_proper "China proper").[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBagley1999158-33)

### Zhou dynasty (1046–256 BC)

The Zhou dynasty (1046 BC to about 256 BC) is the longest-lasting dynasty in Chinese history, though its power declined steadily over the almost eight centuries of its existence. In the late 2nd millennium BC, the Zhou dynasty arose in the Wei River valley of modern western Shaanxi Province, where they were appointed Western Protectors by the [Shang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shang "Shang"). A coalition led by the ruler of the Zhou, [King Wu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Wu_of_Zhou "King Wu of Zhou"), defeated the Shang at the [Battle of Muye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Muye "Battle of Muye"). They took over most of the central and lower Yellow River valley and enfeoffed their relatives and allies in semi-independent states across the region.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-:2-34) Several of these states eventually became more powerful than the Zhou kings.

The kings of Zhou invoked the concept of the [Mandate of Heaven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandate_of_Heaven "Mandate of Heaven") to legitimize their rule, a concept that was influential for almost every succeeding dynasty.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-35) Like Shangdi, Heaven (_tian_) ruled over all the other gods, and it decided who would rule China.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-36) It was believed that a ruler lost the Mandate of Heaven when natural disasters occurred in great number, and when, more realistically, the sovereign had apparently lost his concern for the people. In response, the royal house would be overthrown, and a new house would rule, having been granted the Mandate of Heaven.

The Zhou established two capitals [Zongzhou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zongzhou "Zongzhou") (near modern [Xi'an](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi%27an "Xi'an")) and [Chengzhou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chengzhou "Chengzhou") ([Luoyang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luoyang "Luoyang")), with the king's court moving between them regularly. The Zhou alliance gradually expanded eastward into Shandong, southeastward into the Huai River valley, and southward into the [Yangtze River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangtze_River "Yangtze River") valley.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-:2-34)

#### Spring and Autumn period (722–476 BC)

[![Image 10](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Chinese_plain_5c._BC-en.svg/250px-Chinese_plain_5c._BC-en.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Chinese_plain_5c._BC-en.svg)

Chinese polities in the late 5th century BC, before the breakup of Jin and the Qin move into Sichuan.

In 771 BC, [King You](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_You_of_Zhou "King You of Zhou") and his forces were defeated in the [Battle of Mount Li](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Mount_Li "Battle of Mount Li") by rebel states and [Quanrong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quanrong "Quanrong") barbarians. The rebel aristocrats established a new ruler, [King Ping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Ping_of_Zhou "King Ping of Zhou"), in [Luoyang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luoyang "Luoyang"),[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-37): 4  beginning the second major phase of the Zhou dynasty: the Eastern Zhou period, which is divided into the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods. The former period is named after the famous _[Spring and Autumn Annals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring\_and\_Autumn\_Annals "Spring and Autumn Annals")_. The sharply reduced political authority of the royal house left a power vacuum at the center of the Zhou culture sphere. The Zhou kings had delegated local political authority to hundreds of [settlement states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Chinese_states "Ancient Chinese states"), some of them only as large as a walled town and surrounding land. These states began to fight against one another and vie for [hegemony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hegemony "Hegemony"). The more powerful states tended to conquer and incorporate the weaker ones, so the number of states declined over time.[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-38) By the 6th century BC most small states had disappeared by being annexed and just a few large and powerful principalities remained. Some southern states, such as Chu and Wu, claimed independence from the Zhou, who undertook wars against some of them (Wu and Yue). Many new cities were established in this period and society gradually became more urbanized and commercialized. Many famous individuals such as [Laozi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laozi "Laozi"), [Confucius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confucius "Confucius") and [Sun Tzu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Tzu "Sun Tzu") lived during this chaotic period.

Conflict in this period occurred both between and within states. Warfare between states forced the surviving states to develop better administrations to mobilize more soldiers and resources. Within states there was constant jockeying between elite families. For example, the three most powerful families in the Jin state—Zhao, Wei and Han—eventually overthrew the ruling family and [partitioned the state between them](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_Jin "Partition of Jin").

The [Hundred Schools of Thought](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_Schools_of_Thought "Hundred Schools of Thought") of [classical Chinese philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_philosophy "Chinese philosophy") began blossoming during this period and the subsequent Warring States period. Such influential intellectual movements as [Confucianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confucianism "Confucianism"), [Taoism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taoism "Taoism"), [Legalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legalism_(Chinese_philosophy) "Legalism (Chinese philosophy)") and [Mohism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohism "Mohism") were founded, partly in response to the changing political world. The first two philosophical thoughts would have an enormous influence on Chinese culture.

#### Warring States period (476–221 BC)

[![Image 11](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/EN-WarringStatesAll260BCE.jpg/250px-EN-WarringStatesAll260BCE.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:EN-WarringStatesAll260BCE.jpg)

The Warring States, c. 260 BC

After further political consolidations, seven prominent states remained during the 5th century BC. The years in which these states battled each other is known as the [Warring States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warring_States "Warring States") period. Though the [Zhou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhou_dynasty "Zhou dynasty") king nominally remained as such until 256 BC, he was largely a figurehead that held little real power.

Numerous developments were made during this period in the areas of culture and mathematics—including the _[Zuo Zhuan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zuo\_Zhuan "Zuo Zhuan")_ within the _Spring and Autumn Annals_ (a literary work summarizing the preceding Spring and Autumn period), and the bundle of 21 bamboo slips from the [Tsinghua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsinghua_Bamboo_Slips "Tsinghua Bamboo Slips") collection, dated to 305 BC—being the world's earliest known example of a two-digit, base-10 multiplication table. The Tsinghua collection indicates that sophisticated commercial arithmetic was already established during this period.[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-39)

As neighboring territories of the seven states were annexed (including areas of modern [Sichuan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sichuan "Sichuan") and [Liaoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liaoning "Liaoning")), they were now to be governed under an administrative system of [commanderies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commandery_(China) "Commandery (China)") and [prefectures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefectures "Prefectures"). This system had been in use elsewhere since the Spring and Autumn period, and its influence on administration would prove resilient—its terminology can still be seen in the contemporaneous _[sheng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative\_divisions\_of\_China "Administrative divisions of China")_ and _[xian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative\_divisions\_of\_China "Administrative divisions of China")_ ("provinces" and "counties") of contemporary China.

The state of [Qin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qin_(state) "Qin (state)") became dominant in the waning decades of the Warring States period, conquering the [Shu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shu_(state) "Shu (state)") capital of [Jinsha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinsha_site "Jinsha site") on the Chengdu Plain; and then eventually driving [Chu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chu_(state) "Chu (state)") from its place in the Han River valley. Qin imitated the administrative reforms of the other states, thereby becoming a powerhouse.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-:0-9) Its final expansion began during the reign of [Ying Zheng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ying_Zheng "Ying Zheng"), ultimately unifying the other six regional powers, and enabling him to proclaim himself as China's first [emperor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_of_China "Emperor of China")—known to history as [Qin Shi Huang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qin_Shi_Huang "Qin Shi Huang").

Imperial era
------------

This section is about the ancient dynastic Chinese imperial state. For the empire founded by Yuan Shikai, see [Empire of China (1915–1916)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_of_China_(1915%E2%80%931916) "Empire of China (1915–1916)").

### Early imperial China

#### Qin dynasty (221–206 BC)

[![Image 12](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/Terracotta_Army-China2.jpg/330px-Terracotta_Army-China2.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Terracotta_Army-China2.jpg)

The massive [Terracotta Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terracotta_Army "Terracotta Army") of [Qin Shi Huang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qin_Shi_Huang "Qin Shi Huang"), a UNESCO [World Heritage Site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage_Site "World Heritage Site")

Ying Zheng's establishment of the Qin dynasty (秦朝) in 221 BC effectively formalised the region as a true empire for the first time in Chinese history, rather than a state, and its pivotal status probably led to "Qin" (秦) later evolving into the Western term "[China](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/China "wikt:China")".[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBodde198620-40) To emphasise his sole rule, Zheng proclaimed himself _[Shi Huangdi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qin\_Shi\_Huang "Qin Shi Huang")_ ([始](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%A7%8B "wikt:始")[皇](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E7%9A%87 "wikt:皇")[帝](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%B8%9D "wikt:帝"); "First Emperor"); the _[Huangdi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor\_of\_China "Emperor of China")_ title, derived from [Chinese mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_mythology "Chinese mythology"), became the standard for subsequent rulers.[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBodde198653-41)[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-43) Based in [Xianyang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xianyang "Xianyang"), the empire was a centralized bureaucratic monarchy, a governing scheme which dominated the future of Imperial China.[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-FOOTNOTEEbrey199960-44)[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-FOOTNOTESanft201915-45) In an effort to improve the Zhou's perceived failures, this system consisted of more than 36 [commanderies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commandery_(China) "Commandery (China)") (郡; _jun_),[[b]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-48) made up of [counties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counties_of_China "Counties of China") (县; _xian_) and progressively smaller divisions, each with a local leader.[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-FOOTNOTESanft201915%E2%80%9317-49)

Many aspects of society were informed by [Legalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legalism_(Chinese_philosophy) "Legalism (Chinese philosophy)"), a state ideology promoted by the emperor and his [chancellor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_chancellor_(China) "Grand chancellor (China)")[Li Si](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Si "Li Si") that was introduced at an earlier time by [Shang Yang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shang_Yang "Shang Yang").[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBodde198658%E2%80%9359-50) In legal matters this philosophy emphasised mutual responsibility in disputes and severe punishments for crime, while economic practices included the general encouragement of agriculture and repression of trade.[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBodde198658%E2%80%9359-50) Reforms occurred in weights and measures, writing styles ([seal script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seal_script "Seal script")) and metal currency ([Ban Liang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ban_Liang "Ban Liang")), all of which were standardized.[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-FOOTNOTEEbrey199961-51)[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBodde198656%E2%80%9357,_59%E2%80%9360-52) Traditionally, Qin Shi Huang is regarded as ordering a [mass burning of books and the live burial of scholars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burning_of_books_and_burying_of_scholars "Burning of books and burying of scholars") under the guise of Legalism, though contemporary scholars express considerable doubt on the [historicity of this event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burning_of_books_and_burying_of_scholars#Skepticism "Burning of books and burying of scholars").[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBodde198658%E2%80%9359-50) Despite its importance, Legalism was probably supplemented in non-political matters by [Confucianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confucianism "Confucianism") for social and moral beliefs and the five-element [Wuxing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuxing_(Chinese_philosophy) "Wuxing (Chinese philosophy)") (五行) theories for [cosmological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology "Cosmology") thought.[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBodde198675%E2%80%9378-53)

The Qin administration kept exhaustive records on their population, collecting information on their sex, age, social status and residence.[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-FOOTNOTESanft201917-54) Commoners, who made up over 90% of the population,[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-FOOTNOTELewis2007102-55) "suffered harsh treatment" according to the historian [Patricia Buckley Ebrey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patricia_Buckley_Ebrey "Patricia Buckley Ebrey"), as they were often conscripted into forced labor for the empire's construction projects.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-FOOTNOTEEbrey199963-56) This included a massive system of imperial highways in 220 BC, which ranged around 4,250 miles (6,840 km) altogether.[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBodde198661-57) Other major construction projects were assigned to the general [Meng Tian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meng_Tian "Meng Tian"), who concurrently [led a successful campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qin%27s_campaign_against_the_Xiongnu "Qin's campaign against the Xiongnu") against the northern [Xiongnu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiongnu "Xiongnu") peoples (210s BC), reportedly with 300,000 troops.[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBodde198661-57)[[c]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-59) Under Qin Shi Huang's orders, Meng supervised the combining of numerous ancient walls into what came to be known as the [Great Wall of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Wall_of_China "Great Wall of China") and oversaw the building of a 500 miles (800 km) straight highway between northern and southern China.[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBodde198660%E2%80%9361-60) The emperor also oversaw the construction of his [monumental mausoleum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mausoleum_of_the_First_Qin_Emperor "Mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor"), which includes the well known [Terracotta Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terracotta_Army "Terracotta Army").[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBodde198682%E2%80%9383-61)

After Qin Shi Huang's death the Qin government drastically deteriorated and eventually capitulated in 207 BC after the Qin capital was captured and sacked by rebels, which would ultimately lead to the establishment of the Han Empire.[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBodde198684-62)[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-FOOTNOTESanft201922%E2%80%9324-63)

#### Han dynasty (206 BC – AD 220)

##### Western Han

[![Image 13](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/Han_Expansion.png/250px-Han_Expansion.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Han_Expansion.png)

Map showing the expansion of Han dynasty in the 2nd century BC

The Han dynasty was founded by [Liu Bang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Gaozu_of_Han "Emperor Gaozu of Han"), who emerged victorious in the [Chu–Han Contention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chu%E2%80%93Han_Contention "Chu–Han Contention") that followed the fall of the Qin dynasty. A [golden age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pax_Sinica "Pax Sinica") in Chinese history, the Han dynasty's long period of stability and prosperity consolidated the foundation of China as a unified state under a central imperial bureaucracy, which was to last intermittently for most of the next two millennia. During the Han dynasty, territory of China was extended to most of the [China proper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_proper "China proper") and to areas far west. [Confucianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confucianism "Confucianism") was officially elevated to orthodox status and was to shape the subsequent Chinese civilization. Art, culture and science all advanced to unprecedented heights. With the profound and lasting impacts of this period of Chinese history, the dynasty name "Han" had been taken as the name of the Chinese people, now the [dominant ethnic group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Chinese "Han Chinese") in modern China, and had been commonly used to refer to Chinese language and [written characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_characters "Chinese characters").

After the [initial laissez-faire policies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huang-Lao "Huang-Lao") of Emperors [Wen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Wen_of_Han "Emperor Wen of Han") and [Jing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Jing_of_Han "Emperor Jing of Han"), the ambitious [Emperor Wu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Wu_of_Han "Emperor Wu of Han") brought the empire to its zenith. To consolidate his power, he disenfranchised the majority of imperial relatives, appointing military governors to control their former lands.[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-FOOTNOTENylan201676%E2%80%9379,_84,_107%E2%80%93108-64) As a further step, he extended patronage to Confucianism, which emphasizes stability and order in a well-structured society. [Imperial Universities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taixue "Taixue") were established to support its study. At the urging of his Legalist advisors, however, he also strengthened the fiscal structure of the dynasty [with government monopolies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_Han_Dynasty#Private_manufacture_and_government_monopolies "Economy of the Han Dynasty").

[Major military campaigns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han%E2%80%93Xiongnu_War "Han–Xiongnu War") were launched to weaken the nomadic [Xiongnu Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiongnu "Xiongnu"), limiting their influence north of the Great Wall. Along with the diplomatic efforts led by [Zhang Qian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhang_Qian "Zhang Qian"), the sphere of influence of the Han Empire extended to the [states in the Tarim Basin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Regions "Western Regions"), opened up the [Silk Road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road "Silk Road") that connected China to the west, stimulating bilateral trade and cultural exchange. To the south, various small kingdoms far beyond the Yangtze River Valley were formally incorporated into the empire.

Emperor Wu also dispatched a [series of military campaigns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southward_expansion_of_the_Han_dynasty "Southward expansion of the Han dynasty") against the [Baiyue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baiyue "Baiyue") tribes. The Han annexed [Minyue in 135 BC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_campaigns_against_Minyue "Han campaigns against Minyue") and 111 BC, [Nanyue in 111 BC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han%E2%80%93Nanyue_War "Han–Nanyue War"), and [Dian in 109 BC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_campaign_against_Dian "Han campaign against Dian").[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-FOOTNOTEYu1986455%E2%80%93458-65) Migration and military expeditions led to the cultural assimilation of the south.[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-66) It also brought the Han into contact with kingdoms in Southeast Asia, introducing diplomacy and trade.[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-67)

After Emperor Wu the empire slipped into gradual stagnation and decline. Economically, the state treasury was strained by excessive campaigns and projects, while land acquisitions by elite families gradually drained the tax base. Various [consort clans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consort_clan "Consort clan") exerted increasing control over strings of incompetent emperors and eventually the dynasty was briefly interrupted by the usurpation of [Wang Mang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Mang "Wang Mang").

#### Xin dynasty

In AD 9 the usurper [Wang Mang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Mang "Wang Mang") claimed that the [Mandate of Heaven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandate_of_Heaven "Mandate of Heaven") called for the end of the Han dynasty and the rise of his own, and he founded the short-lived Xin dynasty. Wang Mang started an extensive program of land and other economic reforms, including the outlawing of slavery and land nationalization and redistribution. These programs, however, were never supported by the landholding families, because they favored the peasants. The instability of power brought about chaos, uprisings, and loss of territories. This was compounded by mass flooding of the [Yellow River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_River "Yellow River"); silt buildup caused it to split into two channels and displaced large numbers of farmers. Wang Mang was eventually killed in [Weiyang Palace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weiyang_Palace "Weiyang Palace") by an enraged peasant mob in AD 23.

#### Eastern Han

[Emperor Guangwu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Guangwu_of_Han "Emperor Guangwu of Han") reinstated the Han dynasty with the support of landholding and merchant families at [Luoyang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luoyang "Luoyang"), _east_ of the former capital Xi'an. Thus, this new era is termed the [Eastern Han dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Han_dynasty "Eastern Han dynasty"). With the capable administrations of Emperors [Ming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Ming_of_Han "Emperor Ming of Han") and [Zhang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Zhang_of_Han "Emperor Zhang of Han"), former glories of the dynasty were reclaimed, with brilliant military and cultural achievements. The [Xiongnu Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiongnu "Xiongnu") was [decisively defeated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han%E2%80%93Xiongnu_War#Final_stages "Han–Xiongnu War"). The diplomat and general [Ban Chao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ban_Chao "Ban Chao") further expanded the conquests across the [Pamirs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pamirs "Pamirs") to the shores of the [Caspian Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspian_Sea "Caspian Sea"),[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-68): 175  thus reopening the [Silk Road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road "Silk Road"), and bringing trade, foreign cultures, along with the [arrival of Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Buddhism#Traditional_accounts "Chinese Buddhism"). With extensive connections with the west, the first of several [Roman embassies to China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romano-Chinese_relations "Romano-Chinese relations") were recorded in Chinese sources, coming from the sea route in AD 166, and a second one in AD 284.

The Eastern Han dynasty was one of the [most prolific eras of science and technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_and_technology_of_the_Han_dynasty "Science and technology of the Han dynasty") in ancient China, notably the historic invention of [papermaking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papermaking "Papermaking") by [Cai Lun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cai_Lun "Cai Lun"), and the numerous scientific and mathematical contributions by the famous [polymath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath "Polymath")[Zhang Heng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhang_Heng "Zhang Heng").

### Six Dynasties

#### Three Kingdoms (AD 220–280)

By the 2nd century, the empire declined amidst land acquisitions, invasions, and feuding between [consort clans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consort_clan "Consort clan") and [eunuchs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eunuch#China "Eunuch"). The [Yellow Turban Rebellion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_Turban_Rebellion "Yellow Turban Rebellion") broke out in AD 184, ushering in an era of [warlords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warlord "Warlord"). In the ensuing turmoil, three states emerged, trying to gain predominance and reunify the land, giving this historical period its name. The classic historical novel _[Romance of the Three Kingdoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance\_of\_the\_Three\_Kingdoms "Romance of the Three Kingdoms")_ dramatizes events of this period.

The warlord [Cao Cao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cao_Cao "Cao Cao") reunified the north in 208, and in 220 his son accepted the abdication of [Emperor Xian of Han](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Xian_of_Han "Emperor Xian of Han"), thus initiating the [Wei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cao_Wei "Cao Wei") dynasty. Soon, Wei's rivals [Shu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shu_Han "Shu Han") and [Wu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Wu "Eastern Wu") proclaimed their independence. This period was characterized by a gradual decentralization of the state that had existed during the Qin and Han dynasties, and an increase in the power of great families.

In 266, the [Jin dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jin_dynasty_(265%E2%80%93420) "Jin dynasty (265–420)") overthrew the Wei and later unified the country in 280, but this union was short-lived.

#### Jin dynasty (AD 266–420)

The [Jin dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jin_dynasty_(266%E2%80%93420) "Jin dynasty (266–420)") reunited China proper for the first time since the end of the [Han dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_dynasty "Han dynasty"), ending the [Three Kingdoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Kingdoms "Three Kingdoms") era. However, the Jin dynasty was severely weakened by the [War of the Eight Princes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_Eight_Princes "War of the Eight Princes") and lost control of northern China after [non-Han Chinese settlers rebelled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uprising_of_the_Five_Barbarians "Uprising of the Five Barbarians") and captured [Luoyang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luoyang "Luoyang") and [Chang'an](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chang%27an "Chang'an"). In 317, the Jin prince [Sima Rui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Yuan_of_Jin "Emperor Yuan of Jin"), based in modern-day [Nanjing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanjing "Nanjing"), became emperor and continued the dynasty, now known as the Eastern Jin, which held southern China for another century. Prior to this move, historians refer to the Jin dynasty as the Western Jin.

#### Sixteen Kingdoms (AD 304–439)

Northern China fragmented into a series of independent states known as the [Sixteen Kingdoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixteen_Kingdoms "Sixteen Kingdoms"), most of which were founded by [Xiongnu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiongnu "Xiongnu"), [Xianbei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xianbei "Xianbei"), [Jie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jie_people "Jie people"), [Di](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Di_(Five_Barbarians) "Di (Five Barbarians)") and [Qiang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qiang_(historical_people) "Qiang (historical people)") rulers. These non-Han peoples were ancestors of the [Turks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkic_people "Turkic people"), [Mongols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongols "Mongols"), and [Tibetans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibetans "Tibetans"). Many had, to some extent, been "[sinicized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinicization "Sinicization")" long before their ascent to power. In fact, some of them, notably the [Qiang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qiang_people "Qiang people") and the Xiongnu, had already been allowed to live in the frontier regions within the [Great Wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Wall "Great Wall") since late Han times. During this period, warfare ravaged the north and prompted large-scale Han Chinese migration south to the Yangtze River Basin and Delta.

#### Northern and Southern dynasties (AD 420–589)

[![Image 18](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Southern_and_Northern_Dynasties_440_CE.png/250px-Southern_and_Northern_Dynasties_440_CE.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Southern_and_Northern_Dynasties_440_CE.png)

Southern and Northern Dynasties, 440 AD

In the early 5th century China entered a period known as the Northern and Southern dynasties, in which parallel regimes ruled the northern and southern halves of the country. In the south, the Eastern Jin gave way to the [Liu Song](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Song_dynasty "Liu Song dynasty"), [Southern Qi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Qi "Southern Qi"), [Liang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liang_dynasty "Liang dynasty") and finally [Chen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chen_dynasty "Chen dynasty"). Each of these Southern dynasties were led by Han Chinese ruling families and used [Jiankang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiankang "Jiankang") (modern Nanjing) as the capital. They held off attacks from the north and preserved many aspects of Chinese civilization, while northern barbarian regimes began to [sinify](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinify "Sinify").

In the north the last of the Sixteen Kingdoms was extinguished in 439 by the [Northern Wei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Wei "Northern Wei"), a kingdom founded by the [Xianbei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xianbei "Xianbei"), a nomadic people who unified northern China. The Northern Wei eventually split into the [Eastern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Wei "Eastern Wei") and [Western Wei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Wei "Western Wei"), which then became the [Northern Qi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Qi "Northern Qi") and [Northern Zhou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Zhou "Northern Zhou"). These regimes were dominated by Xianbei or Han Chinese who had married into Xianbei families. During this period most Xianbei people adopted Han surnames, eventually leading to complete assimilation into the Han.

Despite the division of the country, Buddhism spread throughout the land. In southern China, fierce debates about whether [Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism "Buddhism") should be allowed were held frequently by the royal court and nobles. By the end of the era, Buddhists and [Taoists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taoist "Taoist") had become much more tolerant of each other.[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-69)

### Mid-imperial China

#### Sui dynasty (581–618)

[![Image 19](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/Cheui_Dynasty_581_CE.png/250px-Cheui_Dynasty_581_CE.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cheui_Dynasty_581_CE.png)

The short-lived Sui dynasty was a pivotal period in Chinese history. Founded by [Emperor Wen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Wen_of_Sui "Emperor Wen of Sui") in 581 in succession of the [Northern Zhou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Zhou "Northern Zhou"), the Sui went on to conquer the [Southern Chen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chen_dynasty "Chen dynasty") in 589 to reunify China, ending three centuries of political division. The Sui pioneered many new institutions, including the government system of [Three Departments and Six Ministries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Departments_and_Six_Ministries "Three Departments and Six Ministries"), [imperial examinations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_examination "Imperial examination") for selecting officials from commoners, while improved on the systems of [fubing system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fubing_system "Fubing system") of the army conscription and the [equal-field system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal-field_system "Equal-field system") of land distributions. These policies, which were adopted by later dynasties, brought enormous population growth, and amassed excessive wealth to the state. [Standardized coinage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Chinese_coinage "Ancient Chinese coinage") was enforced throughout the unified empire. Buddhism took root as a prominent religion and was supported officially. Sui China was known for its numerous mega-construction projects. Intended for grains shipment and transporting troops, the [Grand Canal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Canal_(China) "Grand Canal (China)") was constructed, linking the capitals [Daxing (Chang'an)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chang%27an "Chang'an") and [Luoyang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luoyang "Luoyang") to the wealthy [southeast region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_China "Southeastern China"), and in another route, to the northeast border. The [Great Wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Wall_of_China "Great Wall of China") was also expanded, while series of military conquests and diplomatic maneuvers further pacified its borders. However, the massive invasions of the [Korean Peninsula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Peninsula "Korean Peninsula") during the [Goguryeo–Sui War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goguryeo%E2%80%93Sui_War "Goguryeo–Sui War") failed disastrously, triggering widespread revolts that led to [the fall of the dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_from_Sui_to_Tang "Transition from Sui to Tang").

#### Tang dynasty (618–907)

[![Image 21](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/China%2C_742.svg/250px-China%2C_742.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:China,_742.svg)

[![Image 23](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/Dunhuang_star_map.jpg/120px-Dunhuang_star_map.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Dunhuang_star_map.jpg)

The [Dunhuang map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunhuang_map "Dunhuang map") is to date the world's oldest complete preserved star atlas.

The Tang dynasty was a [golden age of Chinese civilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pax_Sinica "Pax Sinica"), a prosperous, stable, and creative period with significant developments in culture, art, literature, particularly [poetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tang_poetry "Tang poetry"), and technology. [Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Buddhism "Chinese Buddhism") became the predominant religion for the common people. [Chang'an](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chang%27an "Chang'an") (modern [Xi'an](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi%27an "Xi'an")), the national capital, was the [largest city in the world during its time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_cities_throughout_history "List of largest cities throughout history").[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-70)

The first emperor, [Emperor Gaozu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Gaozu_of_Tang "Emperor Gaozu of Tang"), came to the throne on 18 June 618, placed there by his son, Li Shimin, who became the second emperor, [Taizong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Taizong_of_Tang "Emperor Taizong of Tang"), one of the greatest [emperors in Chinese history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_of_China "Emperor of China"). Combined military conquests and diplomatic maneuvers reduced threats from Central Asian tribes, extended the border, and brought neighboring states into [a tributary system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Chinese_tributary_system "Imperial Chinese tributary system"). Military victories in the [Tarim Basin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tang_dynasty_in_Inner_Asia "Tang dynasty in Inner Asia") kept the Silk Road open, connecting Chang'an to Central Asia and areas far to the west. In the south, lucrative maritime trade routes from port cities such as [Guangzhou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangzhou "Guangzhou") connected with distant countries, and foreign merchants settled in China, encouraging a [cosmopolitan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmopolitanism "Cosmopolitanism") culture. The Tang culture and social systems were observed and adapted by neighboring countries, most notably [Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nara_period "Nara period"). Internally the [Grand Canal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Canal_(China) "Grand Canal (China)") linked the political heartland in Chang'an to the agricultural and economic centers in the eastern and southern parts of the empire. [Xuanzang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xuanzang "Xuanzang"), a Chinese [Buddhist monk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhikkhu "Bhikkhu"), scholar, traveller, and translator travelled to India on his own and returned with "over six hundred Mahayana and Hinayana texts, seven statues of the Buddha and more than a hundred [sarira](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarira "Sarira") relics."

The prosperity of the early Tang dynasty was abetted by a centralized bureaucracy. The government was organized as "[Three Departments and Six Ministries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Departments_and_Six_Ministries "Three Departments and Six Ministries")" to separately draft, review, and implement policies. These departments were run by royal family members and landed aristocrats, but as the dynasty wore on, were joined or replaced by [scholar officials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholar-bureaucrats "Scholar-bureaucrats") selected by [imperial examinations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_examination "Imperial examination"), setting patterns for later dynasties.

Under the Tang "[equal-field system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal-field_system "Equal-field system")" all land was owned by the Emperor and granted to each family according to household size. Men granted land were conscripted for military service for a fixed period each year, a military policy known as the _[fubing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fubing\_system "Fubing system")_ system. These policies stimulated a rapid growth in productivity and a significant army without much burden on the state treasury. By the dynasty's midpoint, however, [standing armies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_army "Standing army") had replaced conscription, and land was continuously falling into the hands of private owners and religious institutions granted exemptions.

[Central Asian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Regions "Western Regions") influence can also be seen in the shape of this cup. The metropolitan and multicultural influences of this era can also be seen in the myriad depictions of foreigners in Tang [Sancai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sancai "Sancai") ceramics and wall murals.

[![Image 25](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/Gilt_silver_jar_with_pattern_of_dancing_horses.jpg/120px-Gilt_silver_jar_with_pattern_of_dancing_horses.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Gilt_silver_jar_with_pattern_of_dancing_horses.jpg)

A Tang period [gilt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilding "Gilding")-silver jar, shaped in the style of northern [nomad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomad "Nomad")'s leather bag decorated with a [horse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestication_of_the_horse "Domestication of the horse") dancing with a cup of wine in its mouth, as the horses of [Emperor Xuanzong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Xuanzong_of_Tang "Emperor Xuanzong of Tang") were trained to do.[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-FOOTNOTEEbrey1999127-71)

The dynasty continued to flourish under the rule of Empress [Wu Zetian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_Zetian "Wu Zetian"), the only official [empress regnant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empress_regnant "Empress regnant") in Chinese history, and reached its zenith during the long reign of [Emperor Xuanzong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Xuanzong_of_Tang "Emperor Xuanzong of Tang"), who oversaw an empire that stretched from the [Pacific](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean "Pacific Ocean") to the [Aral Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aral_Sea "Aral Sea") with at least 50 million people. There were vibrant artistic and cultural creations, including works of the greatest Chinese [poets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tang_poetry "Tang poetry"), [Li Bai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Bai "Li Bai") and [Du Fu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Du_Fu "Du Fu").

At the zenith of prosperity of the empire, the [An Lushan Rebellion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Lushan_Rebellion "An Lushan Rebellion") from 755 to 763 was a watershed event. War, disease, and economic disruption [devastated the population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Lushan_Rebellion#Death_toll "An Lushan Rebellion") and drastically weakened the central imperial government. Upon suppression of the rebellion, regional military governors, known as _[jiedushi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiedushi "Jiedushi")_, gained increasingly autonomous status as the central government lost its ability to control them. With loss of revenue from land tax, the central imperial government came to rely heavily on its [salt monopoly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_in_Chinese_history "Salt in Chinese history"). Externally, former submissive states raided the empire and the vast border territories were lost for centuries. Nevertheless, civil society recovered and thrived amidst the weakened imperial bureaucracy.

In late Tang period the empire was worn out by recurring revolts of the regional military governors, while scholar-officials engaged in fierce [factional strife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niu%E2%80%93Li_factional_strife "Niu–Li factional strife") and corrupted [eunuchs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eunuchs "Eunuchs")[amassed immense power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet_Dew_incident "Sweet Dew incident"). Catastrophically, the [Huang Chao Rebellion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huang_Chao_Rebellion "Huang Chao Rebellion"), from 874 to 884, devastated the entire empire for a decade. The sack of the southern port [Guangzhou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangzhou "Guangzhou") in 879 was followed by the [massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangzhou_massacre "Guangzhou massacre") of most of its inhabitants, especially the large foreign merchant enclaves.[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-72)[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-73) By 881, both capitals, [Luoyang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luoyang "Luoyang") and [Chang'an](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chang%27an "Chang'an"), fell successively. The reliance on ethnic [Han](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Chinese "Han Chinese") and [Turkic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shatuo "Shatuo")[warlords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiedushi "Jiedushi") in suppressing the rebellion increased their power and influence. Consequently, the fall of the dynasty following [Zhu Wen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhu_Wen "Zhu Wen")'s usurpation led to an [era of division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Dynasties_and_Ten_Kingdoms_period "Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period").

In 808, 30,000 Shatuo under Zhuye Jinzhong defected from the Tibetans to Tang China and the Tibetans punished them by killing Zhuye Jinzhong as they were chasing them.[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-74) The Uyghurs also fought against an alliance of Shatuo and Tibetans at Beshbalik.[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-75) The Shatuo Turks under Zhuye Chixin ([Li Guochang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Guochang "Li Guochang")) served the Tang dynasty in fighting against their fellow Turkic people in the [Uyghur Khaganate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uyghur_Khaganate "Uyghur Khaganate"). In 839, when the Uyghur khaganate (Huigu) general Jueluowu (掘羅勿) rose against the rule of then-reigning [Zhangxin Khan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhangxin_Khan "Zhangxin Khan"), he elicited the help from Zhuye Chixin by giving Zhuye 300 horses, and together, they defeated Zhangxin Khan, who then committed suicide, precipitating the subsequent collapse of the Uyghur Khaganate. In the next few years, when Uyghur Khaganate remnants tried to raid Tang borders, the Shatuo participated extensively in counterattacking the Uyghur Khaganate with other tribes loyal to Tang.[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-76) In 843, Zhuye Chixin, under the command of the Han Chinese officer [Shi Xiong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shi_Xiong "Shi Xiong") with Tuyuhun, Tangut and Han Chinese troops, participated in a raid against the Uyghur khaganate that led to the slaughter of Uyghur forces at Shahu mountain.[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-77)

Coins of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms

The period of political disunity between the Tang and the Song, known as the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period, lasted from 907 to 960. During this half-century, China was in all respects a multi-state system. Five regimes, namely, (Later) [Liang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Later_Liang_(Five_Dynasties) "Later Liang (Five Dynasties)"), [Tang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Later_Tang "Later Tang"), [Jin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Later_Jin_(Five_Dynasties) "Later Jin (Five Dynasties)"), [Han](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Later_Han_(Five_Dynasties) "Later Han (Five Dynasties)") and [Zhou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Later_Zhou "Later Zhou"), rapidly succeeded one another in control of the traditional Imperial heartland in northern China. Among the regimes, rulers of (Later) [Tang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Later_Tang "Later Tang"), [Jin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Later_Jin_(Five_Dynasties) "Later Jin (Five Dynasties)") and [Han](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Later_Han_(Five_Dynasties) "Later Han (Five Dynasties)") were [sinicized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinicization "Sinicization")[Shatuo Turks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shatuo "Shatuo"), which ruled over an ethnic majority of [Han Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Chinese "Han Chinese") in the north. More stable and smaller regimes of mostly ethnic Han rulers coexisted in south and western China over the period, cumulatively constituted the "Ten Kingdoms".

Amidst political chaos in the north, the strategic [Sixteen Prefectures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixteen_Prefectures "Sixteen Prefectures") (region along today's [Great Wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Wall_of_China "Great Wall of China")) were ceded to the emerging [Khitan Liao dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liao_dynasty "Liao dynasty"), which drastically weakened the defense of [China proper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_proper "China proper") against northern nomadic empires. To the south, Vietnam [gained lasting independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_B%E1%BA%A1ch_%C4%90%E1%BA%B1ng_(938) "Battle of Bạch Đằng (938)") after [being a Chinese prefecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Chinese_domination_of_Vietnam "Third Chinese domination of Vietnam") for [many centuries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_domination_of_Vietnam "Chinese domination of Vietnam"). With wars dominating in Northern China, there were mass southward migrations of population, which further enhanced the southward shift of cultural and economic centers in China. The era ended with the coup of [Later Zhou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Later_Zhou "Later Zhou") general [Zhao Kuangyin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Taizu_of_Song "Emperor Taizu of Song"), and the establishment of the [Song dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song_dynasty "Song dynasty") in 960, which eventually annihilated the remains of the "Ten Kingdoms" and reunified China.

### Late imperial China

#### Song, Liao, Jin, and Western Xia dynasties (960–1279)

In 960, the Song dynasty was founded by [Emperor Taizu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Taizu_of_Song "Emperor Taizu of Song"), with its capital established in [Kaifeng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaifeng "Kaifeng") (then known as [Bianjing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bianjing "Bianjing")). In 979, the Song dynasty reunified most of [China proper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_proper "China proper"), while large swaths of the outer territories were occupied by [sinicized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinicization "Sinicization")[nomadic empires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomadic_empire "Nomadic empire"). The [Khitan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khitan_people "Khitan people") Liao dynasty, which lasted from 907 to 1125, ruled over [Manchuria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchuria "Manchuria"), [Mongolia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongolia "Mongolia"), and parts of [Northern China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_China "North China"). Meanwhile, in what are now the north-western Chinese provinces of [Gansu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gansu "Gansu"), [Shaanxi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaanxi "Shaanxi"), and [Ningxia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ningxia "Ningxia"), the [Tangut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangut_people "Tangut people") tribes founded the [Western Xia dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Xia "Western Xia") from 1032 to 1227.

Aiming to recover the strategic [sixteen prefectures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixteen_prefectures "Sixteen prefectures") lost in the [previous dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Later_Jin_(Five_Dynasties) "Later Jin (Five Dynasties)"), [campaigns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Gaoliang_River "Battle of Gaoliang River") were launched against the [Liao dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liao_dynasty "Liao dynasty") in the [early Song period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Taizong_of_Song "Emperor Taizong of Song"), which all ended in failure. Then in 1004, the Liao [cavalry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavalry "Cavalry") swept over the exposed [North China Plain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_China_Plain "North China Plain") and reached the outskirts of Kaifeng, forcing the Song's submission and then agreement to the [Chanyuan Treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chanyuan_Treaty "Chanyuan Treaty"), which imposed heavy annual tributes from the Song treasury. The treaty was a significant reversal of Chinese dominance of the traditional [tributary system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Chinese_tributary_system "Imperial Chinese tributary system"). Yet the annual outflow of Song's silver to the Liao was paid back through the purchase of Chinese goods and products, which expanded the Song economy, and replenished its treasury. This dampened the incentive for the Song to further campaign against the Liao. Meanwhile, this cross-border trade and contact induced further sinicization within the [Liao Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liao_dynasty "Liao dynasty"), at the expense of its military might which was derived from its nomadic lifestyle. Similar treaties and social-economical consequences occurred in Song's relations with the [Jin dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jin_dynasty_(1115%E2%80%931234) "Jin dynasty (1115–1234)").

Within the Liao Empire the [Jurchen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurchen_people "Jurchen people") tribes revolted against their overlords to establish the Jin dynasty in 1115. In 1125, the devastating Jin [cataphract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataphract "Cataphract") annihilated the Liao dynasty, while remnants of Liao court members fled to Central Asia to found the [Qara Khitai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qara_Khitai "Qara Khitai") Empire (Western Liao dynasty). [Jin's invasion of the Song dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jin%E2%80%93Song_Wars "Jin–Song Wars") followed swiftly. In 1127, Kaifeng was sacked, a massive catastrophe known as the [Jingkang Incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jingkang_Incident "Jingkang Incident"), ending the [Northern Song dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Song_dynasty "Northern Song dynasty"). Later the [entire north of China was conquered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurchen_campaigns_against_the_Song_dynasty "Jurchen campaigns against the Song dynasty"). The survived members of Song court regrouped in the new capital city of [Hangzhou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangzhou "Hangzhou"), and initiated the [Southern Song dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Song_dynasty "Southern Song dynasty"), which ruled territories south of the [Huai River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huai_River "Huai River"). In the ensuing years, the territory and population of China were divided between the Song dynasty, the Jin dynasty and the Western Xia dynasty. The era ended with the [Mongol conquest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_conquest "Mongol conquest"), as Western Xia fell in 1227, the [Jin dynasty in 1234](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_conquest_of_the_Jin_dynasty "Mongol conquest of the Jin dynasty"), and finally the [Southern Song dynasty in 1279](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_conquest_of_the_Song_dynasty "Mongol conquest of the Song dynasty").

Despite its military weakness, the Song dynasty is widely considered to be the high point of classical Chinese civilization. The [Song economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_Song_dynasty "Economy of the Song dynasty"), facilitated by technological advancement, had reached a level of sophistication probably unseen in world history before its time. The population soared to over 100 million and the living standards of common people improved tremendously due to improvements in rice cultivation and the wide availability of coal for production. The capital cities of Kaifeng and subsequently Hangzhou were both the [most populous cities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_cities_throughout_history "List of largest cities throughout history") in the world for their time, and encouraged vibrant civil societies unmatched by previous Chinese dynasties. Although land trading routes to the far west were blocked by nomadic empires, there was extensive [maritime trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maritime_Silk_Route "Maritime Silk Route") with neighbouring states, such as in [South-east Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South-east_Asia "South-east Asia"), which facilitated the use of Song coinage as the de facto currency of exchange. Giant wooden vessels equipped with [compasses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compass "Compass") traveled throughout the [China Seas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Seas "China Seas") and northern Indian Ocean. The concept of insurance was practised by merchants to hedge the risks of such long-haul maritime [shipments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shipment "Shipment"). With prosperous economic activities, the historically first use of [paper currency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiaozi_(currency) "Jiaozi (currency)") emerged in the western city of [Chengdu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chengdu "Chengdu"), as a cheaper supplement to the existing copper [coins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coin "Coin").

The Song dynasty was considered to be the golden age of great advancements in science and technology of China, thanks to innovative scholar-officials such as [Su Song](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Su_Song "Su Song") (1020–1101) and [Shen Kuo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shen_Kuo "Shen Kuo") (1031–1095). Inventions such as the hydro-mechanical astronomical clock, the first continuous and endless power-transmitting chain, [woodblock printing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodblock_printing "Woodblock printing") and [paper money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_money "Paper money") were all invented during the Song dynasty, further cementing its status.

There was court intrigue between the political reformers and conservatives, led by the chancellors [Wang Anshi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Anshi "Wang Anshi") and [Sima Guang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sima_Guang "Sima Guang"), respectively. By the mid-to-late 13th century, the Chinese had adopted the dogma of [Neo-Confucian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Confucian "Neo-Confucian") philosophy formulated by [Zhu Xi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhu_Xi "Zhu Xi"). Enormous literary works were compiled during the Song dynasty, such as the innovative historical narrative _[Zizhi Tongjian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zizhi\_Tongjian "Zizhi Tongjian")_ ("Comprehensive Mirror to Aid in Government"). The invention of [movable-type printing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodblock_print "Woodblock print") further facilitated the spread of knowledge. Culture and the arts flourished, with grandiose artworks such as _[Along the River During the Qingming Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Along\_the\_River\_During\_the\_Qingming\_Festival "Along the River During the Qingming Festival")_ and _[Eighteen Songs of a Nomad Flute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighteen\_Songs\_of\_a\_Nomad\_Flute "Eighteen Songs of a Nomad Flute")_, along with great Buddhist painters such as the prolific [Lin Tinggui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lin_Tinggui "Lin Tinggui").

The Song dynasty was also a period of major innovation in the [history of warfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_history "Military history"). [Gunpowder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunpowder "Gunpowder"), while invented in the [Tang dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tang_dynasty "Tang dynasty"), was first put into practical use on the battlefield by the Song army, inspiring a succession of new [firearms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm "Firearm") and [siege engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_engine "Siege engine") designs. During the Southern Song dynasty, as its survival hinged decisively on guarding the [Yangtze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangtze "Yangtze") and [Huai River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huai_River "Huai River") against the cavalry forces from the north, the first standing navy in China was assembled in 1132, with its admiral's headquarters established at [Dinghai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinghai "Dinghai"). [Paddle-wheel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paddle_wheel "Paddle wheel") warships equipped with [trebuchets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trebuchet "Trebuchet") could launch [incendiary bombs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incendiary_device "Incendiary device") made of gunpowder and lime to effect, as recorded in Song's victory over the invading Jin forces at the [Battle of Tangdao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Tangdao "Battle of Tangdao") in the [East China Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_China_Sea "East China Sea"), and the [Battle of Caishi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Caishi "Battle of Caishi") on the Yangtze River in 1161.

The advances in civilisation during the Song dynasty came to an abrupt end following the devastating Mongol conquest of the North and subsequently other areas of the empire, during which the population sharply dwindled, with a marked contraction in economy. Despite viciously [halting Mongol advances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_conquest_of_the_Song_dynasty "Mongol conquest of the Song dynasty") for more than three decades, the Southern Song capital Hangzhou fell in 1276, followed by the final annihilation of the Song standing navy at the [Battle of Yamen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Yamen "Battle of Yamen") in 1279.

#### Yuan dynasty (1271–1368)

Mongol successor khanates

The [Yuan dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuan_dynasty "Yuan dynasty") was formally proclaimed in 1271, when the [Great Khan of Mongol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Mongol_rulers "List of Mongol rulers"), [Kublai Khan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kublai_Khan "Kublai Khan"), one of the grandsons of [Genghis Khan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genghis_Khan "Genghis Khan"), assumed the additional title of [Emperor of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_of_China "Emperor of China"), and considered [his inherited part](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_of_the_Mongol_Empire "Division of the Mongol Empire") of the Mongol Empire as a [Chinese dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_dynasty "Chinese dynasty"). In the preceding decades, the Mongols had conquered the Jin dynasty in Northern China, and the Southern Song dynasty fell in 1279 after a protracted and bloody war. The [Mongol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongols "Mongols") Yuan dynasty became the first [conquest dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conquest_dynasty "Conquest dynasty") in Chinese history to rule the entirety of [China proper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_proper "China proper") and [its population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ethnic_groups_in_China "List of ethnic groups in China") as an [ethnic minority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongols_in_China "Mongols in China"). The dynasty also directly controlled the [Mongol heartland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_heartland "Mongol heartland") and other regions, inheriting the largest share of territory of the [eastern Mongol empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_of_the_Mongol_Empire "Division of the Mongol Empire"), which roughly coincided with the modern area of China and nearby regions in East Asia. Further expansion of the empire was halted after defeats in the [invasions of Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_invasions_of_Japan "Mongol invasions of Japan") and [Vietnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_invasions_of_Vietnam "Mongol invasions of Vietnam"). Following the previous Jin dynasty, the capital of Yuan dynasty was established at [Khanbaliq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khanbaliq "Khanbaliq") (also known as Dadu, modern-day Beijing). The [Grand Canal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Canal_(China) "Grand Canal (China)") was reconstructed to connect the remote capital city to lively economic hubs in southern part of China, setting the precedence and foundation for Beijing to largely remain as the [capital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_capitals_of_China "Historical capitals of China") of the successive regimes of the unified Chinese mainland.

A series of [Mongol civil wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_of_the_Mongol_Empire#Civil_war "Division of the Mongol Empire") in the late 13th century led to the [division of the Mongol Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_of_the_Mongol_Empire "Division of the Mongol Empire"). In 1304 the emperors of the Yuan dynasty were upheld as the nominal [Khagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khagan "Khagan") over western khanates (the [Chagatai Khanate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chagatai_Khanate "Chagatai Khanate"), the [Golden Horde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Horde "Golden Horde") and the [Ilkhanate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilkhanate "Ilkhanate")), which nonetheless remained _de facto_ autonomous. The era was known as _[Pax Mongolica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pax\_Mongolica "Pax Mongolica")_, when much of the Asian continent was ruled by the Mongols. For the first and only time in history, the [Silk Road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road "Silk Road") was controlled entirely by a single state, facilitating the flow of people, trade, and cultural exchange. A network of roads and a [postal system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yam_(route) "Yam (route)") were established to connect the vast empire. Lucrative maritime trade, developed from the previous Song dynasty, continued to flourish, with [Quanzhou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quanzhou "Quanzhou") and [Hangzhou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangzhou "Hangzhou") emerging as the largest ports in the world. Adventurous travelers from the far west, most notably the [Venetian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Venice "Republic of Venice"), [Marco Polo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Polo "Marco Polo"), would settle in China for decades. Upon his return, his detail [travel record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Travels_of_Marco_Polo "The Travels of Marco Polo") inspired generations of [medieval Europeans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Middle_Ages "High Middle Ages") with the splendors of the far East. The Yuan dynasty was the first ancient economy, where [paper currency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_currency "Paper currency"), known at the time as _[Jiaochao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiaochao "Jiaochao")_, was used as the predominant medium of exchange. Its unrestricted issuance in the late Yuan dynasty inflicted [hyperinflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation "Hyperinflation"), which eventually brought the downfall of the dynasty.

The Pagoda of Bailin Temple, an octagonal-based brick pagoda built in 1330 during the reign of [Emperor Wenzong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayaatu_Khan_Tugh_Tem%C3%BCr "Jayaatu Khan Tugh Temür"), ruler of the Mongol-led Yuan Dynasty (1271–1368).

While the Mongol rulers of the Yuan dynasty adopted substantially to Chinese culture, their [sinicization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinicization "Sinicization") was of lesser extent compared to earlier [conquest dynasties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conquest_dynasty "Conquest dynasty") in Chinese history. For preserving racial superiority as the conqueror and ruling class, traditional nomadic customs and heritage from the [Mongolian Steppe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongolian_Steppe "Mongolian Steppe") were held in high regard. On the other hand, the Mongol rulers also adopted flexibly to a variety of cultures from many advanced civilizations within the vast empire. Traditional social structure and culture in China underwent immense transform during the Mongol dominance. Large groups of [foreign migrants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semu "Semu") settled in China, who enjoyed elevated social status over the majority Han Chinese, while enriching Chinese culture with foreign elements. The class of [scholar officials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholar-official "Scholar-official") and intellectuals, traditional bearers of elite Chinese culture, lost substantial social status. This stimulated the development of culture of the common folks. There were prolific works in _[zaju](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaju "Zaju")_ variety shows and [literary songs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanqu "Sanqu") (_[sanqu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanqu "Sanqu")_), which were written in a distinctive [poetry style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuan_poetry "Yuan poetry") known as _[qu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qu\_(poetry) "Qu (poetry)")_. Novels of vernacular style gained unprecedented status and popularity.

A [stupa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stupa "Stupa") on top of an arch (_crossing street tower_), is a common form of architecture during Yuan period.

Before the Mongol invasion, Chinese dynasties reported approximately 120 million inhabitants; after the conquest had been completed in 1279, the 1300 census reported roughly 60 million people.[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-78) This major decline is not necessarily due only to Mongol killings. Scholars such as Frederick W. Mote argue that the wide drop in numbers reflects an administrative failure to record rather than an actual decrease; others such as [Timothy Brook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Brook "Timothy Brook") argue that the Mongols created a system of [enserfment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serfdom "Serfdom") among a huge portion of the Chinese populace, causing many to disappear from the census altogether; other historians including William McNeill and David Morgan consider that [plague](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plague_(disease) "Plague (disease)") was the main factor behind the demographic decline during this period. In the 14th century China suffered additional depredations from epidemics of plague, estimated to have killed around a quarter of the population of China.[[76]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-79): 348–351

Throughout the Yuan dynasty, there was some general sentiment among the populace against the Mongol dominance. Yet rather than the nationalist cause, it was mainly strings of natural disasters and incompetent, corrupt governance that triggered widespread peasant uprisings since the 1340s. After the [massive naval engagement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Largest_naval_battle_in_history "Largest naval battle in history")[at Lake Poyang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Lake_Poyang "Battle of Lake Poyang"), [Zhu Yuanzhang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hongwu_Emperor "Hongwu Emperor") prevailed over other rebel forces in the south. He proclaimed himself [emperor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_of_China "Emperor of China") and founded the [Ming dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ming_dynasty "Ming dynasty") in 1368. The same year his northern expedition army captured the capital Khanbaliq. The Yuan remnants fled back to Mongolia and [sustained the regime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Yuan_dynasty "Northern Yuan dynasty"), but the period of Yuan dominance was effectively over for good. Other Mongol Khanates in Central Asia continued to exist after the fall of Yuan dynasty in China.

[Xinye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinye_Village "Xinye Village"), a village noted for its well-preserved Ming and Qing era architecture and ancient residential buildings.

The [Ming dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ming_dynasty "Ming dynasty") was founded by Zhu Yuanzhang in 1368, who proclaimed himself as the [Hongwu Emperor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hongwu_Emperor "Hongwu Emperor"). The capital was initially set at [Nanjing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanjing "Nanjing"), and was later moved to [Beijing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing "Beijing") from [Yongle Emperor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yongle_Emperor "Yongle Emperor")'s reign onward.

Urbanization increased as the population grew and as the division of labor grew more complex. Large urban centers, such as Nanjing and Beijing, also contributed to the growth of private industry. In particular, small-scale industries grew up, often specializing in paper, silk, cotton, and porcelain goods. For the most part, however, relatively small urban centers with markets proliferated around the country. Town markets mainly traded food, with some necessary manufactures such as pins or oil.

Despite the [xenophobia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenophobia "Xenophobia") and intellectual introspection characteristic of the increasingly popular new school of [neo-Confucianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Confucianism "Neo-Confucianism"), China under the early Ming dynasty was not isolated. Foreign trade and other contacts with the outside world, particularly Japan, increased considerably. Chinese merchants explored all of the Indian Ocean, reaching East Africa with the [voyages of Zheng He](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasure_voyages "Treasure voyages").

The Hongwu Emperor, being the only founder of a [Chinese dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynasties_of_China "Dynasties of China") who was also of peasant origin, had laid the foundation of a state that relied fundamentally in agriculture. Commerce and trade, which flourished in the previous [Song](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song_dynasty "Song dynasty") and [Yuan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuan_dynasty "Yuan dynasty") dynasties, were less emphasized. Neo-feudal landholdings of the Song and Mongol periods were expropriated by the Ming rulers. Land estates were confiscated by the government, fragmented, and rented out. Private slavery was forbidden. Consequently, after the death of the Yongle Emperor, independent peasant landholders predominated in Chinese agriculture. These laws might have paved the way to removing the worst of the poverty during the previous regimes. Towards later era of the Ming dynasty, with declining government control, commerce, trade and private industries revived.

The dynasty had a strong and complex central government that unified and controlled the empire. The emperor's role became more autocratic, although Hongwu Emperor necessarily continued to use what he called the "[Grand Secretariat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Secretariat "Grand Secretariat")" to assist with the immense paperwork of the bureaucracy, including [memorials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_to_the_throne "Memorial to the throne") (petitions and recommendations to the throne), imperial edicts in reply, reports of various kinds, and tax records. It was this same bureaucracy that later prevented the Ming government from being able to adapt to changes in society, and eventually led to its decline.

The Yongle Emperor strenuously tried to extend China's influence beyond its borders by demanding other rulers send ambassadors to China to present tribute. A large navy was built, including four-masted ships displacing 1,500 tons. A standing army of 1 million troops was created. The Chinese armies [conquered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ming%E2%80%93H%E1%BB%93_War "Ming–Hồ War") and [occupied Vietnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Chinese_domination_of_Vietnam "Fourth Chinese domination of Vietnam") for around 20 years, while the [Chinese fleet sailed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasure_voyages "Treasure voyages") the China seas and the Indian Ocean, cruising as far as the east coast of Africa. The Chinese gained influence in eastern [Moghulistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moghulistan "Moghulistan"). Several maritime Asian nations sent envoys with tribute for the Chinese emperor. Domestically, the Grand Canal was expanded and became a stimulus to domestic trade. Over 100,000 tons of iron per year were produced. Many books were printed using movable type. The imperial palace in Beijing's [Forbidden City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbidden_City "Forbidden City") reached its current splendor. It was also during these centuries that the potential of south China came to be fully exploited. New crops were widely cultivated and industries such as those producing porcelain and textiles flourished.

In 1449 [Esen Tayisi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esen_Tayisi "Esen Tayisi") led an [Oirat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oirats "Oirats") Mongol invasion of northern China which culminated in the capture of the [Zhengtong Emperor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Yingzong_of_Ming "Emperor Yingzong of Ming") at [Tumu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumu_Crisis "Tumu Crisis"). Since then, the Ming became on the defensive on the northern frontier, which led to the [Ming Great Wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ming_Great_Wall "Ming Great Wall") being built. Most of what remains of the Great Wall of China today was either built or repaired by the Ming. The brick and granite work was enlarged, the watchtowers were redesigned, and cannons were placed along its length.

At sea the Ming became increasingly isolationist after the death of the Yongle Emperor. The treasure voyages which sailed the Indian Ocean were discontinued, and the [maritime prohibition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haijin "Haijin") laws were set in place banning the Chinese from sailing abroad. European traders who reached China in the midst of the [Age of Discovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Discovery "Age of Discovery") were repeatedly rebuked in their requests for trade, with the Portuguese being [repulsed by the Ming navy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Tunmen "Battle of Tunmen") at [Tuen Mun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuen_Mun "Tuen Mun") in 1521 and again [in 1522](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Battle_of_Tamao "Second Battle of Tamao"). Domestic and foreign demands for overseas trade, deemed illegal by the state, led to widespread _[wokou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wokou "Wokou")_ piracy attacking the southeastern coastline during the rule of the [Jiajing Emperor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiajing_Emperor "Jiajing Emperor") (1507–1567), which only subsided after the opening of ports in [Guangdong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong "Guangdong") and [Fujian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fujian "Fujian") and [much military suppression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiajing_wokou_raids "Jiajing wokou raids").[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-80) In addition to raids from Japan by the _[wokou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wokou "Wokou")_, raids from Taiwan and the [Philippines by the Pisheye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_history_of_the_Philippines#Pre-colonial_period_(900_AD_to_1565) "Military history of the Philippines") also ravaged the southern coasts.[[78]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-81) The Portuguese were allowed to settle in [Macau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macau "Macau") in 1557 for trade, which remained in Portuguese hands until 1999. After the Spanish invasion of the Philippines, trade with the [Spanish at Manila](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manila_Galleon "Manila Galleon") imported large quantities of [Mexican and Peruvian silver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_silver_trade_from_the_16th_to_19th_centuries "Global silver trade from the 16th to 19th centuries") from the [Spanish Americas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Americas "Spanish Americas") to China.[[79]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-82): 144–145  The Dutch entry into the Chinese seas was also met with fierce resistance, with the Dutch being chased off the [Penghu islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penghu "Penghu") in the [Sino-Dutch conflicts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Dutch_conflicts "Sino-Dutch conflicts") of 1622–1624 and were forced to settle in Taiwan instead. [The Dutch in Taiwan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Formosa "Dutch Formosa") fought with the Ming in the [Battle of Liaoluo Bay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Liaoluo_Bay "Battle of Liaoluo Bay") in 1633 and lost, and eventually surrendered to the Ming loyalist [Koxinga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koxinga "Koxinga") in 1662, after the fall of the Ming dynasty.

In 1556, during the rule of the [Jiajing Emperor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiajing_Emperor "Jiajing Emperor"), the [Shaanxi earthquake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1556_Shaanxi_earthquake "1556 Shaanxi earthquake") killed about 830,000 people, the deadliest earthquake of all time.

The Ming dynasty intervened deeply in the [Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_invasions_of_Korea_(1592%E2%80%931598) "Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598)"), which ended with the withdrawal of all invading Japanese forces in Korea, and the restoration of the [Joseon dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseon "Joseon"), its traditional ally and [tributary state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tributaries_of_Imperial_China "List of tributaries of Imperial China"). The [regional hegemony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Chinese_tributary_system "Imperial Chinese tributary system") of the Ming dynasty was preserved at a toll on its resources. Coincidentally, with Ming's control in [Manchuria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchuria "Manchuria") in decline, the [Manchu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchu_people "Manchu people") ([Jurchen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurchen_people "Jurchen people")) tribes, under their chieftain [Nurhaci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurhaci "Nurhaci"), broke away from Ming's rule, and emerged as a powerful, unified state, which was [later proclaimed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Taiji "Hong Taiji") as the [Qing dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qing_dynasty "Qing dynasty"). It went on to subdue the much weakened [Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseon_dynasty "Joseon dynasty") as its [tributary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tributaries_of_Imperial_China "List of tributaries of Imperial China"), conquered [Mongolia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Yuan_dynasty "Northern Yuan dynasty"), and expanded its territory to the outskirt of the Great Wall. The most elite army of the Ming dynasty was to station at the [Shanhai Pass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanhai_Pass "Shanhai Pass") to guard the last stronghold against the Manchus, which weakened its suppression of internal [peasants uprisings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Zicheng "Li Zicheng").

The Qing dynasty (1644–1912) was the last imperial dynasty in China. Founded by the [Manchus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchu_people "Manchu people"), it was the second [conquest dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conquest_dynasty "Conquest dynasty") to rule the entirety of [China proper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_proper "China proper"), and roughly doubled the territory controlled by the Ming. The Manchus were formerly known as [Jurchens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurchen_people "Jurchen people"), residing in the northeastern part of the Ming territory outside the Great Wall. They emerged as the major threat to the late Ming dynasty after [Nurhaci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurhaci "Nurhaci") united all Jurchen tribes and his son, [Hong Taiji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Taiji "Hong Taiji"), declared the founding of the Qing dynasty in 1636. The Qing dynasty set up the [Eight Banners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_Banners "Eight Banners") system that provided the basic framework for the Qing military conquest. [Li Zicheng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Zicheng "Li Zicheng")'s peasant rebellion captured Beijing in 1644 and the [Chongzhen Emperor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chongzhen_Emperor "Chongzhen Emperor"), the last Ming emperor, committed suicide. The Manchus allied with the Ming general [Wu Sangui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_Sangui "Wu Sangui") to seize Beijing, which was made the capital of the Qing dynasty, and then proceeded to subdue the [Ming remnants in the south](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Ming_dynasty "Southern Ming dynasty"). During the [Ming-Qing transition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_from_Ming_to_Qing "Transition from Ming to Qing"), when the Ming dynasty and later the Southern Ming, the emerging Qing dynasty, and several other factions like the [Shun dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shun_dynasty "Shun dynasty") and [Xi dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_dynasty "Xi dynasty") founded by peasant revolt leaders fought against each another, which, along with innumerable [natural disasters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_disaster "Natural disaster") at that time such as those caused by the [Little Ice Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Ice_Age "Little Ice Age")[[80]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-83) and [epidemics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic "Epidemic") like the [Great Plague during the last decade of the Ming dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Plague_in_the_late_Ming_dynasty "Great Plague in the late Ming dynasty"),[[81]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-84) caused enormous loss of lives and [significant harm to the economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_history_of_China_before_1912#Qing_dynasty_(1644%E2%80%931912) "Economic history of China before 1912"). In total, these decades saw the loss of as many as 25 million lives, but the Qing appeared to have restored China's imperial power and inaugurate another flowering of the arts.[[82]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-85) The early Manchu emperors combined traditions of [Inner Asian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_Asia "Inner Asia") rule with Confucian norms of traditional Chinese government and were considered a Chinese dynasty.

The Manchus enforced a 'queue order', forcing Han Chinese men to adopt the Manchu [queue hairstyle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(hairstyle) "Queue (hairstyle)"). Officials were required to wear Manchu-style clothing _[Changshan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changshan "Changshan")_ ([bannermen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_Banners "Eight Banners") dress and _[Tangzhuang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangzhuang "Tangzhuang")_), but ordinary Han civilians were allowed to wear [traditional Han clothing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Chinese_clothing "Ancient Chinese clothing"). Bannermen could not undertake trade or manual labor; they had to petition to be removed from banner status. They were considered aristocracy and were given annual pensions, land, and allotments of cloth. The [Kangxi Emperor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangxi_Emperor "Kangxi Emperor") ordered the creation of the _[Kangxi Dictionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangxi\_Dictionary "Kangxi Dictionary")_, the most complete dictionary of Chinese characters that had been compiled.

Over the next half-century, all areas previously under the Ming dynasty were consolidated under the Qing. [Conquests in Central Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Great_Campaigns "Ten Great Campaigns") in the eighteenth century extended territorial control. Between 1673 and 1681, the Kangxi Emperor suppressed the [Revolt of the Three Feudatories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolt_of_the_Three_Feudatories "Revolt of the Three Feudatories"), an uprising of three generals in Southern China who had been denied hereditary rule of large fiefdoms granted by the [previous emperor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunzhi_Emperor "Shunzhi Emperor"). In 1683, the Qing staged an amphibious assault on southern Taiwan, bringing down the rebel [Kingdom of Tungning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Tungning "Kingdom of Tungning"), which was founded by the Ming loyalist [Koxinga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koxinga "Koxinga") (Zheng Chenggong) in 1662 after the fall of the Southern Ming, and had served as a base for continued Ming resistance in Southern China. The Qing [defeated the Russians at Albazin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Russian_border_conflicts "Sino-Russian border conflicts"), resulting in the [Treaty of Nerchinsk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Nerchinsk "Treaty of Nerchinsk").

By the end of [Qianlong Emperor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qianlong_Emperor "Qianlong Emperor")'s long reign in 1796, the Qing Empire was at [its zenith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Qing_era "High Qing era"). The Qing ruled more than [one-third of the world's population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_empires#Empires_at_their_greatest_extent "List of largest empires"), and had the largest economy in the world. By area it was [one of the largest empires ever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_empires#Empires_at_their_greatest_extent "List of largest empires").

In the 19th century the empire was internally restive and externally threatened by western powers. The defeat by the [British Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire "British Empire") in the [First Opium War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Opium_War "First Opium War") (1840) led to the [Treaty of Nanking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Nanking "Treaty of Nanking") (1842), under which [Hong Kong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Hong_Kong_(1800s%E2%80%931930s) "History of Hong Kong (1800s–1930s)") was ceded to Britain and importation of [opium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opium "Opium") (produced by British Empire territories) was allowed. Opium usage continued to grow in China, adversely affecting societal stability. Subsequent military defeats and [unequal treaties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unequal_treaties "Unequal treaties") with other western powers continued even after the fall of the Qing dynasty.

Internally the [Taiping Rebellion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiping_Rebellion "Taiping Rebellion") (1851–1864), a Christian religious movement led by the "Heavenly King" [Hong Xiuquan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Xiuquan "Hong Xiuquan") swept from the south to establish the [Taiping Heavenly Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiping_Heavenly_Kingdom "Taiping Heavenly Kingdom") and controlled roughly a third of China proper for over a decade. The court in desperation empowered Han Chinese officials such as [Zeng Guofan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeng_Guofan "Zeng Guofan") to raise local armies. After initial defeats, Zeng crushed the rebels in the [Third Battle of Nanking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Battle_of_Nanking "Third Battle of Nanking") in 1864.[[83]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-Kuhn-86) This was one of the largest wars in the 19th century in troop involvement; there was massive loss of life, with a death toll of about 20 million.[[84]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-87) A string of civil disturbances followed, including the [Punti–Hakka Clan Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punti%E2%80%93Hakka_Clan_Wars "Punti–Hakka Clan Wars"), [Nian Rebellion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nian_Rebellion "Nian Rebellion"), [Dungan Revolt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungan_revolt_(1862%E2%80%931877) "Dungan revolt (1862–1877)"), and [Panthay Rebellion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panthay_Rebellion "Panthay Rebellion").[[85]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-88) All rebellions were ultimately put down, but at enormous cost and with millions dead, seriously weakening the central imperial authority. China never rebuilt a strong central army, and many local officials used their military power to effectively rule independently in their provinces.[[83]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-Kuhn-86)

A scene of the [Taiping Rebellion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiping_Rebellion "Taiping Rebellion")

Yet the dynasty appeared to recover in the [Tongzhi Restoration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongzhi_Restoration "Tongzhi Restoration") (1860–1872), led by Manchu royal family reformers and Han Chinese officials such as Zeng Guofan and his proteges [Li Hongzhang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Hongzhang "Li Hongzhang") and [Zuo Zongtang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zuo_Zongtang "Zuo Zongtang"). Their [Self-Strengthening Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-Strengthening_Movement "Self-Strengthening Movement") made effective institutional reforms, imported Western factories and communications technology, with prime emphasis on strengthening the military. However, the reform was undermined by official rivalries, cynicism, and quarrels within the imperial family. The defeat of [Yuan Shikai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuan_Shikai "Yuan Shikai")'s modernized "[Beiyang Fleet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beiyang_Fleet "Beiyang Fleet")" in the [First Sino-Japanese War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Sino-Japanese_War "First Sino-Japanese War") (1894–1895) led to the formation of the [New Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Army "New Army"). The [Guangxu Emperor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangxu_Emperor "Guangxu Emperor"), advised by [Kang Youwei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kang_Youwei "Kang Youwei"), then launched a comprehensive reform effort, the [Hundred Days' Reform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_Days%27_Reform "Hundred Days' Reform") (1898). [Empress Dowager Cixi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empress_Dowager_Cixi "Empress Dowager Cixi"), however, feared that precipitous change would lead to bureaucratic opposition and foreign intervention and quickly suppressed it.

In the summer of 1900, the [Boxer Uprising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxer_Rebellion "Boxer Rebellion") opposed foreign influence and murdered Chinese Christians and foreign missionaries. When Boxers entered Beijing, the Qing government ordered all foreigners to leave, but they and many Chinese Christians were [besieged in the foreign legations quarter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_the_International_Legations "Siege of the International Legations"). An [Eight-Nation Alliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight-Nation_Alliance "Eight-Nation Alliance") sent the [Seymour Expedition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seymour_Expedition "Seymour Expedition") of Japanese, Russian, British, Italian, German, French, American, and Austrian troops to relieve the siege, but they were routed and forced to retreat by Boxer and Qing troops at the [Battle of Langfang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Langfang "Battle of Langfang"). After [the Alliance's attack on the Dagu Forts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Dagu_Forts_(1900) "Battle of Dagu Forts (1900)"), the court declared war on the Alliance and authorised the Boxers to join with imperial armies. After [fierce fighting at Tianjin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Tientsin "Battle of Tientsin"), the Alliance formed the second, much larger [Gaselee Expedition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaselee_Expedition "Gaselee Expedition") and [finally reached Beijing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Peking_(1900) "Battle of Peking (1900)"); the Empress Dowager evacuated to [Xi'an](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi%27an "Xi'an"). The [Boxer Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxer_Protocol "Boxer Protocol") ended the war, exacting a tremendous [indemnity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxer_Indemnity "Boxer Indemnity").

The Qing court then instituted administrative and legal reforms known as the [late Qing reforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Qing_reforms "Late Qing reforms"), including abolition of the [examination system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_examinations "Imperial examinations"). But young officials, military officers, and students debated reform, perhaps a [constitutional monarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_monarchy "Constitutional monarchy"), or the overthrow of the dynasty and the creation of a republic. They were inspired by an emerging public opinion formed by intellectuals such as [Liang Qichao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liang_Qichao "Liang Qichao") and the revolutionary ideas of [Sun Yat-sen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Yat-sen "Sun Yat-sen"). A localised military uprising, the [Wuchang uprising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuchang_uprising "Wuchang uprising"), began on 10 October 1911, in [Wuchang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuchang "Wuchang") (today part of [Wuhan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan "Wuhan")), and soon spread. The Republic of China was proclaimed on 1 January 1912, ending 2,000 years of dynastic rule.

[Nanjing Road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanjing_Road "Nanjing Road") during [Xinhai Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinhai_Revolution "Xinhai Revolution"), 1911

The [provisional government of the Republic of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_Government_of_the_Republic_of_China_(1912) "Provisional Government of the Republic of China (1912)") was formed in [Nanjing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanjing "Nanjing") on 12 March 1912. Sun Yat-sen became [President of the Republic of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_Republic_of_China "President of the Republic of China"), but he turned power over to [Yuan Shikai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuan_Shikai "Yuan Shikai"), who commanded the [New Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Army "New Army"). Over the next few years, Yuan proceeded to abolish the national and provincial assemblies, and declared himself as the emperor of [Empire of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_of_China_(1915%E2%80%931916) "Empire of China (1915–1916)") in late 1915, in the style of an [absolute monarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_monarchy "Absolute monarchy"). Yuan's imperial ambitions were fiercely opposed by his subordinates; faced with the rapidly growing prospect of violent rebellion, he abdicated in March 1916 and died of natural causes in June.

Yuan's death in 1916 left a power vacuum; the republican government (that had been nearly brought to its knees by his policies) was all but shattered. This opened the way for the [Warlord Era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warlord_Era "Warlord Era"), during which much of China was ruled by shifting coalitions of competing provincial military leaders and the [Beiyang government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beiyang_government "Beiyang government"), ushering in a short-lived period of uncertainty. Intellectuals, disappointed in the failure of the Republic, launched the [New Culture Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Culture_Movement "New Culture Movement").

[![Image 67](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/Beijing_students_protesting_the_Treaty_of_Versailles_%28May_4%2C_1919%29.jpg/250px-Beijing_students_protesting_the_Treaty_of_Versailles_%28May_4%2C_1919%29.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Beijing_students_protesting_the_Treaty_of_Versailles_(May_4,_1919).jpg)

Beijing college students rallied during the [May Fourth Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_Fourth_Movement "May Fourth Movement"), dissatisfied with Article 156 of the [Treaty of Versailles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Versailles "Treaty of Versailles") for China ([Shandong Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shandong_Problem "Shandong Problem")).

In 1919, the [May Fourth Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_Fourth_Movement "May Fourth Movement") began as a response to the pro-Japanese terms imposed on China by the [Treaty of Versailles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Versailles "Treaty of Versailles") following World War I. It quickly became a nationwide protest movement. The protests were a moral success as the cabinet fell and China refused to sign the Treaty of Versailles, which had awarded German holdings of [Shandong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shandong "Shandong") to Japan. Memory of the mistreatment at Versailles fuels resentment into the 21st century.[[86]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-89)

Political and intellectual ferment waxed strong throughout the 1920s and 1930s. According to Patricia Ebrey:

> Nationalism, patriotism, progress, science, democracy, and freedom were the goals; imperialism, feudalism, warlordism, autocracy, patriarchy, and blind adherence to tradition were the enemies. Intellectuals struggled with how to be strong and modern and yet Chinese, how to preserve China as a political entity in the world of competing nations.[[87]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-FOOTNOTEEbrey1999271-90)

In the 1920s Sun Yat-sen established a revolutionary base in Guangzhou and set out to unite the fragmented nation. He welcomed assistance from the [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union") (itself fresh from Lenin's Communist takeover) and he entered into an alliance with the fledgling [Chinese Communist Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Communist_Party "Chinese Communist Party") (CCP). After Sun's death from cancer in 1925, one of his protégés, [Chiang Kai-shek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiang_Kai-shek "Chiang Kai-shek"), seized control of the [Nationalist Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuomintang "Kuomintang") (KMT) and succeeded in bringing most of south and central China under its rule in the [Northern Expedition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Expedition "Northern Expedition") (1926–1927). Having defeated the warlords in the south and central China by [military force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Revolutionary_Army "National Revolutionary Army"), Chiang was able to secure the nominal allegiance of the warlords in the North and establish the [Nationalist government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalist_government "Nationalist government") in Nanjing. In 1927, Chiang turned on the CCP and relentlessly purged the Communists elements in his [NRA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Revolutionary_Army "National Revolutionary Army"). In 1934, driven from their mountain bases such as the [Chinese Soviet Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Soviet_Republic "Chinese Soviet Republic"), the CCP forces embarked on the [Long March](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_March "Long March") across China's most desolate terrain to the northwest, a feat transformed into legend, where they established a guerrilla base at [Yan'an](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yan%27an "Yan'an") in Shaanxi. During the Long March, the communists reorganised under a new leader, [Mao Zedong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mao_Zedong "Mao Zedong") (Mao Tse-tung).

Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek announced the Kuomintang policy of resistance against Japan at Lushan on 10 July 1937, three days after the [Seventy-seven Incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Polo_Bridge_Incident "Marco Polo Bridge Incident").

The bitter [Chinese Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Civil_War "Chinese Civil War") between the Nationalists and the Communists continued, openly or clandestinely, through the 14-year-long Japanese occupation of various parts of the country (1931–1945). The two Chinese parties nominally formed a United Front to oppose the Japanese in 1937, during the [Second Sino-Japanese War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Sino-Japanese_War "Second Sino-Japanese War") (1937–1945), which became a part of [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II"), although this alliance was tenuous at best and disagreements, sometimes violent, between the forces were still common. Japanese forces committed numerous [war atrocities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_war_crimes "Japanese war crimes") against the civilian population, including biological warfare (see [Unit 731](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731 "Unit 731")) and the [Three Alls Policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Alls_Policy "Three Alls Policy") (_Sankō Sakusen_), namely being: "Kill All, Burn All and Loot All".[[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-91) During the war, China was recognized as one of the Allied "[Big Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Policemen "Four Policemen")" in the [Declaration by United Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_by_United_Nations "Declaration by United Nations"), as a tribute to its enduring struggle against the invading Japanese.[[89]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-92) China was one of the four major [Allies of World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II "Allies of World War II"), and was later considered one of the primary victors in the war.[[90]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-93)

Following the defeat of Japan in 1945, the war between the Nationalist government forces and the CCP resumed, after failed attempts at reconciliation and a negotiated settlement. By 1949, the CCP had established control over most of the country. [Odd Arne Westad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odd_Arne_Westad "Odd Arne Westad") says the Communists won the Civil War because they made fewer military mistakes than Chiang, and because in his search for a powerful centralized government, Chiang antagonised too many interest groups in China. Furthermore, his party was weakened in the war against the Japanese. Meanwhile, the Communists told different groups, such as peasants, exactly what they wanted to hear, and cloaked themselves in the cover of Chinese Nationalism.[[91]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-94) During the civil war both the Nationalists and Communists carried out mass atrocities, with millions of non-combatants killed by both sides.[[92]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-95) These included deaths from forced conscription and massacres.[[93]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-96)

The Nationalists were slowly routed towards the South. When the Nationalist government forces were defeated by CCP forces in mainland China in 1949, the Nationalist government fled to [Taiwan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan "Taiwan") with its forces, along with Chiang and a large number of their supporters; the Nationalist government had taken effective control of Taiwan at the end of WWII as part of the overall Japanese surrender, when Japanese troops in Taiwan surrendered to the Republic of China troops there.[[94]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-97)

Until the early 1970s the ROC was recognised as the [sole legitimate government of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_and_the_United_Nations "China and the United Nations") by the United Nations, the United States and most Western nations, refusing to recognise the PRC on account of its status as a communist nation during the Cold War. This changed in 1971 when the [PRC was seated in the United Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_2758 "United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758"), replacing the ROC. The KMT ruled Taiwan under martial law until 1987, with the stated goal of being vigilant against Communist infiltration and preparing to retake mainland China. Therefore, political dissent was not tolerated during that period, and crackdowns against dissidents were common.

In the 1990s the ROC underwent a major democratic reform, beginning with the 1991 resignation of the members of the [Legislative Yuan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislative_Yuan "Legislative Yuan") and [National Assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Assembly "National Assembly") elected in 1947. These groups were originally created to represent mainland China constituencies. Also lifted were the restrictions on the use of Taiwanese languages in the broadcast media and in schools. In 1996, the ROC held [its first direct presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996_Taiwanese_presidential_election "1996 Taiwanese presidential election"), and the incumbent president, KMT candidate [Lee Teng-hui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Teng-hui "Lee Teng-hui"), was elected. In 2000, the KMT status as the ruling party ended when the DPP took power, only to regain its status in the [2008 election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Taiwan_presidential_election "2008 Taiwan presidential election") by [Ma Ying-jeou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ma_Ying-jeou "Ma Ying-jeou").

Due to the controversial nature of [Taiwan's political status](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_status_of_Taiwan "Political status of Taiwan"), the ROC is currently recognised by [merely 12 UN member states and the Holy See](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_relations_of_Taiwan "Foreign relations of Taiwan") as of 2024 as the legitimate government of "China".

### People's Republic of China (since 1949)

Map of the [Chinese Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Civil_War "Chinese Civil War")

Major combat in the Chinese Civil War ended in 1949 with the KMT pulling out of the mainland, with the government relocating to [Taipei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taipei "Taipei") and maintaining control only over a few islands. The CCP was left in control of [mainland China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainland_China "Mainland China"). On 1 October 1949, Mao Zedong proclaimed the People's Republic of China.[[95]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-Ref_c-98) "Communist China" and "Red China" were two common names for the PRC.[[96]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-Ref_d-99)

The PRC was shaped by a [series of campaigns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_campaigns_of_the_Chinese_Communist_Party "List of campaigns of the Chinese Communist Party") and [five-year plans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-year_plans_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China "Five-year plans of the People's Republic of China"). The [Great Leap Forward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward "Great Leap Forward"), a radical campaign that encompassed numerous attempted economic and social reforms, resulted in tens of millions of deaths.[[97]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-Akbar2010-100)[_[better source needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTRS "Wikipedia:NOTRS")_] Mao's government carried out mass executions of landowners, instituted [collectivisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collectivisation "Collectivisation") and implemented the [Laogai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laogai "Laogai") camp system. Execution, deaths from forced labor and other atrocities resulted in millions of deaths under Mao. In 1966 Mao and his allies launched the [Cultural Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Revolution "Cultural Revolution"), which continued until Mao's death a decade later. The Cultural Revolution, motivated by power struggles within the Party and a fear of the [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union"), led to a major upheaval in Chinese society.

Following the [Sino-Soviet split](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Soviet_split "Sino-Soviet split") and motivated by concerns of invasion by either the Soviet Union or the United States, China initiated the [Third Front campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Front_(China) "Third Front (China)") to develop national defense and industrial infrastructure in its rugged interior.[[98]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-:9-101): 44  Through its distribution of infrastructure, industry, and human capital around the country, the Third Front created favorable conditions for subsequent market development and private enterprise.[[98]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-:9-101): 177

In 1972, at the peak of the Sino-Soviet split, Mao and [Zhou Enlai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhou_Enlai "Zhou Enlai") met U.S. president [Richard Nixon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon "Richard Nixon") in Beijing to establish relations with the US. In the same year, the [PRC was admitted to the United Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_2758 "United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758") in place of the Republic of China, with permanent membership of the Security Council.

A power struggle followed Mao's death in 1976. The [Gang of Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gang_of_Four "Gang of Four") were arrested and blamed for the excesses of the Cultural Revolution, marking the end of a turbulent political era in China. [Deng Xiaoping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deng_Xiaoping "Deng Xiaoping") outmaneuvered Mao's anointed successor chairman [Hua Guofeng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hua_Guofeng "Hua Guofeng"), and gradually emerged as the _de facto_ leader over the next few years.

Deng Xiaoping was the [Paramount Leader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Leader "Paramount Leader") of China from 1978 to 1992, although he never became the head of the party or state, and his influence within the Party led the country to [significant economic reforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_economic_reform "Chinese economic reform"). The CCP subsequently loosened governmental control over citizens' personal lives and the [communes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_commune "People's commune") were disbanded with many peasants receiving multiple land leases, which greatly increased incentives and agricultural production. In addition, there were many free market areas opened. The most successful free market area was Shenzhen. It is located in Guangdong and the property tax free area still exists today. This turn of events marked China's transition from a planned economy to a mixed economy with an increasingly open market environment, a system termed by some[[99]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-Ref_e-102) as [market socialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_socialism "Market socialism"), and officially by the CCP as [Socialism with Chinese characteristics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism_with_Chinese_characteristics "Socialism with Chinese characteristics"). The PRC adopted its current [constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China "Constitution of the People's Republic of China") on 4 December 1982.

In 1989 the death of former general secretary [Hu Yaobang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hu_Yaobang "Hu Yaobang") helped to spark the [Tiananmen Square protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989_Tiananmen_Square_protests_and_massacre "1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre") of that year, during which students and others campaigned for several months, speaking out against corruption and in favour of greater political reform, including democratic rights and freedom of speech. However, they were eventually put down on 4 June when [Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Liberation_Army "People's Liberation Army") troops and vehicles entered and forcibly cleared the square, resulting in [considerable numbers of fatalities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989_Tiananmen_Square_protests#Death_toll "1989 Tiananmen Square protests"). This event was widely reported, and brought worldwide condemnation and sanctions against the communist government.[[100]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-Ref_f-103)[[101]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-Ref_g-104)

CCP general secretary and PRC president [Jiang Zemin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiang_Zemin "Jiang Zemin") and PRC premier [Zhu Rongji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhu_Rongji "Zhu Rongji"), both former mayors of Shanghai, led post-Tiananmen PRC in the 1990s. Under Jiang and Zhu's ten years of administration, the PRC's economic performance pulled an estimated 150 million peasants out of poverty and sustained an average annual gross domestic product growth rate of 11.2%.[[102]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-Ref_i-105)[_[better source needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTRS "Wikipedia:NOTRS")_] The country formally joined the [World Trade Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Organization "World Trade Organization") in 2001. By [1997](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handover_of_Hong_Kong "Handover of Hong Kong") and [1999](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_of_sovereignty_over_Macau "Transfer of sovereignty over Macau"), former European colonies of [British Hong Kong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Hong_Kong "British Hong Kong") and [Portuguese Macau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_Macau "Portuguese Macau") became the Hong Kong and Macau [special administrative regions of the People's Republic of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_administrative_regions_of_China "Special administrative regions of China"), respectively.

Although the PRC needed economic growth to spur its development, the government began to worry that rapid economic growth was degrading the country's natural resources and environment. Another concern was that certain sectors of society were not sufficiently benefiting from the PRC's economic development; one example of this was the wide gap between urban and rural areas in terms of development and prevalence of updated infrastructure. As a result, under former CCP general secretary and President [Hu Jintao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hu_Jintao "Hu Jintao") and Premier [Wen Jiabao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wen_Jiabao "Wen Jiabao"), the PRC initiated policies to address issues of equitable distribution of resources, but the outcome was not known as of 2014.[[103]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-Ref_j-106) More than 40 million farmers were displaced from their land,[[104]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-Ref_k-107) usually for economic development, contributing to 87,000 demonstrations and riots across China in 2005.[[105]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-Ref_l-108) For much of the PRC's population, living standards improved very substantially and freedom increased, but political controls remained tight and rural areas poor.[[106]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-109)

According to the [U.S. Department of Defense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Department_of_Defense "U.S. Department of Defense"), as many as 3 million [Uyghurs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uyghurs "Uyghurs") and members of other [Muslim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_China "Islam in China") minority groups are being held in China's [internment camps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinjiang_internment_camps "Xinjiang internment camps") which are located in the [Xinjiang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinjiang "Xinjiang") region and which Western news reports often label as "concentration camps".[[107]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-110) The camps were established in late 2010s under [Xi Jinping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping "Xi Jinping")'s [administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping_Administration "Xi Jinping Administration").[[108]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-:1b-111)[[109]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-112)[Human Rights Watch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights_Watch "Human Rights Watch") says that they have been used to indoctrinate Uyghurs and other Muslims since 2017 as part of a [people's war on terror](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_war_on_terror "People's war on terror"), a policy announced in 2014.[[110]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-auto1-113)[[111]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-fp-gulag-114)[[108]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-:1b-111) The use of these centers appears to have ended in 2019 following international pressure.[[112]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-Dou-2022-115) Academic [Kerry Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerry_Brown_(historian) "Kerry Brown (historian)") attributes their closures beginning in late 2019 to the expense required to operate them.[[113]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-:1022-116): 138  China has repeatedly denied this, asserting that the West has never been able to produce reliably-sourced satellite footage of any such detainment or resulting detention of minority groups. Although no comprehensive independent surveys of such centres have been performed as of June 2024, spot checks by journalists have found such sites converted or abandoned.[[112]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-Dou-2022-115) In 2022, a Washington Post reporter checked a dozen sites previously identified as reeducation centres and found "[m]ost of them appeared to be empty or converted, with several sites labeled as coronavirus quarantine facilities, teachers' schools and vocational schools."[[112]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-Dou-2022-115) In 2023, [Amnesty International](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesty_International "Amnesty International") said that they were "witnessing more and more arbitrary detention", but that detained individuals were being moved from the camps into the [formal prison system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penal_system_in_China "Penal system in China").[[114]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China#cite_note-117)

The novel coronavirus [SARS-CoV-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS-CoV-2 "SARS-CoV-2"), which causes the disease [COVID-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19 "COVID-19"), was first detected in [Wuhan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan "Wuhan"), Hubei in 2019 and led to a [global pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic "COVID-19 pandemic"), causing the majority of the world to enter a period of lockdown for at least a year following.
