The quantity is defined in two different ways, depending on the context: Total rate of energy transfer (not per unit area); [ 1 ] SI units: W = J⋅s −1 .

Specific rate of energy transfer (total normalized per unit area); [ 2 ] SI units : W⋅m −2 = J⋅m −2 ⋅s −1 : This is a vector quantity , its components being determined in terms of the normal (perpendicular)  direction to the surface of measurement.

This is sometimes called energy flux density , to distinguish it from the first definition.

Radiative flux , heat flux , and sound energy flux density [ 3 ] (also sound intensity ) [ 4 ] are specific cases of this meaning.
