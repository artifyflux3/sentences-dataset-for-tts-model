[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] He was a member of the Reichstag between 1881 and 1884, between 1885 and 1898, and between 1901 and 1903.

[ 4 ] Career [ edit ] Barth started his political career with the National Liberal Party . He soon rejected the Manchesterism of the old liberals, though, and claimed that liberalism needed a social programme. To that end, he sought the cooperation of the Social Democrats, [ 4 ] and at multiple times voted against his own party. In the German Freeminded Party ( Freisinnige Partei ), founded in 1884, Barth would soon find himself opposed to the leadership of Eugen Richter . When the Freeminded Party split in 1893, Barth became a member of the Freeminded Union ( Freisinnigen Vereinigung ), instead of the Freeminded People's Party of Richter. In 1903, Friedrich Naumann would join the Freeminded Union as well. Barth however would found the Democratic Union [ 4 ] ( Demokratische Vereinigung ) in 1908, together with Rudolf Breitscheid and Hellmut von Gerlach , after the Freeminded Union's participation in the Bülow-Block coalition in the 1907 elections .

Barth founded the liberal weekly Die Nation (The Nation) in 1883 [ 4 ] and remained as editor until his death in 1909.
