[ 1 ] It may be determined using the following formula (using the Einstein summation convention ), which is the component form of the pullback operation: [ 2 ] g a b = ∂ ∂ a X μ μ ∂ ∂ b X ν ν g μ μ ν ν {\displaystyle g_{ab}=\partial _{a}X^{\mu }\partial _{b}X^{\nu }g_{\mu \nu }\ } Here a {\displaystyle a} , b {\displaystyle b} describe the indices of coordinates ξ ξ a {\displaystyle \xi ^{a}} of the submanifold while the functions X μ μ ( ξ ξ a ) {\displaystyle X^{\mu }(\xi ^{a})} encode the embedding into the higher-dimensional manifold whose tangent indices are denoted μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } , ν ν {\displaystyle \nu } .

Example – Curve in 3D [ edit ] Let Π Π : : C → → R 3 , τ τ ↦ ↦ { x 1 = ( a + b cos ⁡ ⁡ ( n ⋅ ⋅ τ τ ) ) cos ⁡ ⁡ ( m ⋅ ⋅ τ τ ) x 2 = ( a + b cos ⁡ ⁡ ( n ⋅ ⋅ τ τ ) ) sin ⁡ ⁡ ( m ⋅ ⋅ τ τ ) x 3 = b sin ⁡ ⁡ ( n ⋅ ⋅ τ τ ) .

{\displaystyle \Pi \colon {\mathcal {C}}\to \mathbb {R} ^{3},\ \tau \mapsto {\begin{cases}{\begin{aligned}x^{1}&=(a+b\cos(n\cdot \tau ))\cos(m\cdot \tau )\\x^{2}&=(a+b\cos(n\cdot \tau ))\sin(m\cdot \tau )\\x^{3}&=b\sin(n\cdot \tau ).\end{aligned}}\end{cases}}} be a map from the domain of the curve C {\displaystyle {\mathcal {C}}} with parameter τ τ {\displaystyle \tau } into the Euclidean manifold R 3 {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}} . Here a , b , m , n ∈ ∈ R {\displaystyle a,b,m,n\in \mathbb {R} } are constants.

Then there is a metric given on R 3 {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}} as g = ∑ ∑ μ μ , ν ν g μ μ ν ν d x μ μ ⊗ ⊗ d x ν ν with g μ μ ν ν = ( 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 ) {\displaystyle g=\sum \limits _{\mu ,\nu }g_{\mu \nu }\mathrm {d} x^{\mu }\otimes \mathrm {d} x^{\nu }\quad {\text{with}}\quad g_{\mu \nu }={\begin{pmatrix}1&0&0\\0&1&0\\0&0&1\end{pmatrix}}} .

and we compute g τ τ τ τ = ∑ ∑ μ μ , ν ν ∂ ∂ x μ μ ∂ ∂ τ τ ∂ ∂ x ν ν ∂ ∂ τ τ g μ μ ν ν ⏟ ⏟ δ δ μ μ ν ν = ∑ ∑ μ μ ( ∂ ∂ x μ μ ∂ ∂ τ τ ) 2 = m 2 a 2 + 2 m 2 a b cos ⁡ ⁡ ( n ⋅ ⋅ τ τ ) + m 2 b 2 cos 2 ⁡ ⁡ ( n ⋅ ⋅ τ τ ) + b 2 n 2 {\displaystyle g_{\tau \tau }=\sum \limits _{\mu ,\nu }{\frac {\partial x^{\mu }}{\partial \tau }}{\frac {\partial x^{\nu }}{\partial \tau }}\underbrace {g_{\mu \nu }} _{\delta _{\mu \nu }}=\sum \limits _{\mu }\left({\frac {\partial x^{\mu }}{\partial \tau }}\right)^{2}=m^{2}a^{2}+2m^{2}ab\cos(n\cdot \tau )+m^{2}b^{2}\cos ^{2}(n\cdot \tau )+b^{2}n^{2}} Therefore g C = ( m 2 a 2 + 2 m 2 a b cos ⁡ ⁡ ( n ⋅ ⋅ τ τ ) + m 2 b 2 cos 2 ⁡ ⁡ ( n ⋅ ⋅ τ τ ) + b 2 n 2 ) d τ τ ⊗ ⊗ d τ τ {\displaystyle g_{\mathcal {C}}=(m^{2}a^{2}+2m^{2}ab\cos(n\cdot \tau )+m^{2}b^{2}\cos ^{2}(n\cdot \tau )+b^{2}n^{2})\,\mathrm {d} \tau \otimes \mathrm {d} \tau } See also [ edit ] First fundamental form References [ edit ] ^ Lee, John M.
