In the southern portion of the gyre, northwesterly (or southeastward-flowing) winds drive eastward-flowing currents that are difficult to distinguish from the northern boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current .

[ 1 ] Like other oceanic gyres, it collects vast amounts of floating debris as a garbage patch .

[ 2 ] Southern boundary [ edit ] Main article: Antarctic Circumpolar Current South of this gyre is the Antarctic Circumpolar Current . This current flows from West to East around Antarctica . Another name for this current is the West Wind Drift. This current allows Antarctica to maintain its huge ice sheet by keeping warm ocean waters away. At approximately 125 Sv , this current is the largest ocean current.

[ 3 ] Western boundary [ edit ] Main article: Brazil Current A tristan thrush on Inaccessible Island , strewn with oceanic trash.

The Brazil Current is the western boundary current of the gyre.  It flows south along the Brazilian coast to the Rio de la Plata .  The current is considerably weaker than its North Atlantic counterpart, the Gulf Stream .
