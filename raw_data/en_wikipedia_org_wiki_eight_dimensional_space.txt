When n = 8, the set of all such locations is called 8-dimensional space . Often such spaces are studied as vector spaces , without any notion of distance. Eight-dimensional Euclidean space is eight-dimensional space equipped with the Euclidean metric .

More generally the term may refer to an eight-dimensional vector space over any field , such as an eight-dimensional complex vector space, which has 16 real dimensions. It may also refer to an eight-dimensional manifold such as an 8-sphere , or a variety of other geometric constructions.

Geometry [ edit ] 8-polytope [ edit ] Main article: 8-polytope A polytope in eight dimensions is called an 8-polytope. The most studied are the regular polytopes , of which there are only three in eight dimensions : the 8-simplex , 8-cube , and 8-orthoplex . A broader family are the uniform 8-polytopes , constructed from fundamental symmetry domains of reflection, each domain defined by a Coxeter group . Each uniform polytope is defined by a ringed Coxeter-Dynkin diagram . The 8-demicube is a unique polytope from the D 8 family, and 4 21 , 2 41 , and 1 42 polytopes from the E 8 family.

It has symbol S 7 , with formal definition for the 7-sphere with radius r of S 7 = { x ∈ ∈ R 8 : ‖ ‖ x ‖ ‖ = r } .

{\displaystyle S^{7}=\left\{x\in \mathbb {R} ^{8}:\|x\|=r\right\}.} The volume of the space bounded by this 7-sphere is V 8 = π π 4 24 R 8 {\displaystyle V_{8}\,={\frac {\pi ^{4}}{24}}\,R^{8}} which is 4.05871 × r 8 , or 0.01585 of the 8-cube that contains the 7-sphere.

Kissing number problem [ edit ] Main article: Kissing number problem The kissing number problem has been solved in eight dimensions, thanks to the existence of the 4 21 polytope and its associated lattice . The kissing number in eight dimensions is 240 .

Octonions [ edit ] Main article: Octonion The octonions are a normed division algebra over the real numbers, the largest such algebra. Mathematically they can be specified by 8-tuplets of real numbers, so form an 8-dimensional vector space over the reals, with addition of vectors being the addition in the algebra. A normed algebra is one with a product that satisfies ‖ ‖ x y ‖ ‖ ≤ ≤ ‖ ‖ x ‖ ‖ ‖ ‖ y ‖ ‖ {\displaystyle \|xy\|\leq \|x\|\|y\|} for all x and y in the algebra. A normed division algebra additionally must be finite-dimensional, and have the property that every non-zero vector has a unique multiplicative inverse.

Hurwitz's theorem prohibits such a structure from existing in dimensions other than 1, 2, 4, or 8.

Biquaternions [ edit ] The complexified quaternions C ⊗ ⊗ H {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} \otimes \mathbb {H} } , or " biquaternions ," are an eight-dimensional algebra dating to William Rowan Hamilton 's work in the 1850s. This algebra is equivalent (that is, isomorphic ) to the Clifford algebra C ℓ ℓ 2 ( C ) {\displaystyle C\ell _{2}(\mathbb {C} )} and the Pauli algebra . It has also been proposed as a practical or pedagogical tool for doing calculations in special relativity , and in that context goes by the name Algebra of physical space (not to be confused with the Spacetime algebra , which is 16-dimensional.)
