[ 4 ] He is best known for his contribution in the field of next-generation sequencing of DNA (that subsequently resulted in Solexa , a high-speed DNA sequencing company that he co-founded), [ 2 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] nanopipette-based scanning ion-conductance microscopy , [ 9 ] [ 10 ] and super-resolution microscopy .

[ 11 ] Early life and education [ edit ] Klenerman is the son of two South African-born Jews.

[ 12 ] He was educated at the University of Cambridge where he was an undergraduate student of Christ's College, Cambridge and received his BA degree in 1982.

[ 13 ] He earned his PhD degree in chemistry in 1986 as a postgraduate student of Churchill College, Cambridge and was supervised by Ian William Murison Smith .

[ 14 ] [ 1 ] [ 13 ] Career and research [ edit ] After his doctorate, Klenerman went to Stanford University as a Fulbright scholar to work on high-overtone chemistry, with Richard Zare . After his postdoctoral research at Stanford, he returned to United Kingdom to work in BP Research for seven years. Then, in 1994, he joined the University of Cambridge, as a faculty member of the Department of Chemistry and a fellow of Christ's College.

[ 1 ] [ 13 ] [ 15 ] Klenerman, along with Shankar Balasubramanian , invented a method of next-generation DNA sequencing which is commonly known today as the Solexa sequencing or Illumina dye sequencing .

[ 5 ] [ 7 ] The method is based on the detection of fluorophore labelled nucleotides as they get incorporated in the DNA strands.

[ 16 ] This sequencing by synthesis method gained popularity, [ 17 ] [ 18 ] and is currently regarded as the most widely used platform to replace conventional Sanger sequencing technique, despite its comparatively low multiplexing capability of samples, as it offers several key advantages: it is automated, quick, highly accurate, capable of sequencing multiple strands simultaneously via massive parallel sequencing , and economically cheaper in case of whole genome sequencing.

[ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] He is also known for exploring nanopipette-based (instead of conventional micropipette-based) scanning ion-conductance microscopy methods.

[ 9 ] [ 22 ] His research group was successful in achieving very high resolution topographic images of live-cells, in hopping mode imaging, in precise delivery of small molecules to cell, and in studying real time detailed cell-functioning.

[ 10 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] Most recently, his group is focusing on 3D super-resolution microscopy to develop new insights on protein misfolding and neurodegenerative diseases .

[ 11 ] Commercial activities [ edit ] Klenerman and Shankar Balasubramanian commercialised their invention on the single-molecule-fluorescence based high-speed DNA sequencing and jointly founded Solexa in 1998. Later, in 2007, this company was acquired by Illumina for $600 million.

[ 5 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] In 2004, Klenerman co-founded another spin-out company, Ionscope, to supply assembled scanning ion-conductance microscopes to the research community that looks for high-resolution 3D images of live cells. As per the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council , as of February 2014, Ionscope sold 35 SICM units worldwide.

[ 29 ] Awards and honours [ edit ] The major awards and honours that Klenerman received in recognition of his research work: 2007: Awarded RSC Interdisciplinary Award by the Royal Society of Chemistry .

[ 1 ] 2008: Delivered the British Biophysical Society Lecture at the University College Dublin .

[ 30 ] 2012: Elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS).

[ 31 ] 2015: Elected a Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences (FMedSci).

[ 32 ] 2018: Awarded the Royal Medal by the Royal Society .

[ 33 ] 2019: knighted in the 2019 New Year Honours for services to science and the development of high-speed DNA sequencing technology [ 34 ] 2020: Won Millennium Technology Prize along with Professor Sir Shankar Balasubramanian on their innovation of Next Generation DNA Sequencing 2021: Won the 2022 Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences along with Professor Sir Shankar Balasubramanian and Pascal Mayer on their innovation of Next Generation DNA Sequencing [ 35 ] 2024: Canada Gairdner International Award [ 36 ] References [ edit ] ^ a b c d "Interdisciplinary Award 2007 Winner" .
