Advisories ( 注意報 , Chūihō ) Warnings ( 警報 , Keihō ) Emergency Warnings ( 特別警報 , Tokubetsu Keihō ) [ 1 ] Bulletins ( 気象情報 , Kishō Jōhō ) : provide information to supplement warnings and advisories.

[ 2 ] Meteorological Warnings [ edit ] Weather advisories and warnings are issued when potentially hazardous weather is occurring or is forecast for the short-term period.

General Warnings [ edit ] Due to its local-scale nature, an advisory is typically issued in advance for public forecast areas where conditions may be favorable for the development of severe weather. A warning is issued for areas where severe weather is imminent or occurring.
