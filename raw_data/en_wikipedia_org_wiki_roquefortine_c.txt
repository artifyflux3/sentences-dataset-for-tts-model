N verify ( what is Y N ?) Infobox references Chemical compound Roquefortine C is a mycotoxin that belongs to a class of naturally occurring 2,5-diketopiperazines [ 1 ] produced by various fungi , particularly species from the genus Penicillium .

[ 2 ] It was first isolated from a strain of Penicillium roqueforti , a species commercially used as a source of proteolytic and lipolytic enzymes during maturation of the blue-veined cheeses, Roquefort , Danish Blue , Stilton and Gorgonzola .

Roquefortine C is a cyclodipeptide mycotoxin derived from the diketopiperazine cyclo(Trp-dehydro-His) and is a relatively common fungal metabolite produced by a number of Penicillium species. It is also considered one of the most important fungal contaminants of carbonated beverages, beer, wine, meats, cheese and bread.

[ 3 ] At high doses roquefortine C is classified as a toxic compound.

[ 4 ] Although it is a potent neurotoxin [ 5 ] [ 6 ] at high doses, at low concentrations of 0.05 to 1.47 mg/kg that occur in domestic cheeses, it was found to be "safe for the consumer".

[ 7 ] The mechanisms underlying its toxicity and metabolism have been investigated by studying its interaction with mammalian cytochrome P450 enzymes.

[ 4 ] In addition to these toxic properties, roquefortine C  reportedly possesses bacteriostatic activity against gram-positive bacteria , [ 8 ] but only in those organisms containing haemoproteins .

[ 4 ] [ 9 ] Roquefortine C contains the unusual E-dehydrohistidine moiety, a system that typically undergoes facile isomerization under acidic, basic, or photochemical conditions to isoroquefortine C, the 3,12 double-bond Z-isomer of roquefortine C.

[ 10 ] Isomerisation of Roquefortine C to Isoroquefortine C However isoroquefortine C is not a natural product and in contrast to roquefortine C does not bind iron.  Both have been synthesised.
