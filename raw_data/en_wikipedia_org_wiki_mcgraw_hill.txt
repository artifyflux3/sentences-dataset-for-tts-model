In 1980, McGraw Hill paid the African American writer and civil rights activist [James Baldwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Baldwin "James Baldwin") a $200,000 advance for his unfinished book _Remember This House_, a memoir of his personal recollections of civil rights leaders [Medgar Evers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medgar_Evers "Medgar Evers"), [Malcolm X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_X "Malcolm X") and [Martin Luther King Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr. "Martin Luther King Jr.")[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McGraw-Hill#cite_note-mcgrawhill-59) Following his death, McGraw Hill sued his estate to recover the advance they had paid him for the unfinished book.

In October 2015, McGraw-Hill Education was accused of [whitewashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitewashing_(communications) "Whitewashing (communications)") history after it published a caption in a geography textbook referring to [American slaves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States "Slavery in the United States") as "workers".[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McGraw-Hill#cite_note-60) McGraw Hill issued an apology, updated the digital version of the materials, and offered schools replacement texts at no charge.[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McGraw-Hill#cite_note-61) It has been linked to broader controversies about texts at the [Texas Education Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Education_Agency#Curriculum_controversies "Texas Education Agency").[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McGraw-Hill#cite_note-62)

McGraw Hill has been accused of using online access codes included with texts to prevent students from reselling used books.[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McGraw-Hill#cite_note-63) During the [COVID-19 pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic "COVID-19 pandemic"), when many students were studying remotely, McGraw Hill was accused of [price gouging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_gouging "Price gouging"), in charging several times more for [ebooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebook "Ebook") than for print texts.[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McGraw-Hill#cite_note-64)
