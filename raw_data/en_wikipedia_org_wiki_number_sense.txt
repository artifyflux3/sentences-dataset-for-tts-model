The term was popularized by Stanislas Dehaene in his 1997 book "The Number Sense," but originally named by the mathematician Tobias Dantzig in his 1930 text Number: The Language of Science .

Psychologists believe that the number sense in humans can be differentiated into the approximate number system , a system that supports the estimation of the magnitude , and the parallel individuation system , which allows the tracking of individual objects, typically for quantities below 4.

[ 1 ] There are also some differences in how number sense is defined in math cognition . For example, Gersten and Chard say number sense "refers to a child's fluidity and flexibility with numbers, the sense of what numbers mean and an ability to perform mental mathematics and to look at the world and make comparisons." [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] In non-human animals, number sense is not the ability to count, but the ability to perceive changes in the number of things in a collection.

[ 5 ] All mammals, and most birds, will notice if there is a change in the number of their young nearby. Many birds can distinguish two from three.

[ 6 ] Researchers consider number sense to be of prime importance for children in early elementary education , and the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics has made number sense a focus area of pre-K through 2nd grade mathematics education.

[ 7 ] An active area of research is to create and test teaching strategies to develop children's number sense. Number sense also refers to the contest hosted by the University Interscholastic League .  This contest is a ten-minute test where contestants solve math problems mentally—no calculators, scratch-work, or mark-outs are allowed.

[ 8 ] Concepts involved in number sense [ edit ] The term number sense involves several concepts of magnitude , ranking , comparison , measurement , rounding , percents , and estimation , including: [ 9 ] estimating with large numbers to provide reasonable approximations; judging the degree of precision appropriate to a situation; understanding the hidden meaning of numbers through analytical and critical thinking (e.g., Freakonomics [ 10 ] ); rounding (understanding reasons for rounding large numbers and limitations in comparisons); choosing measurement units to make sense for a given situation; solving real-life problems involving percentages and decimal portions; comparing physical measurements within and between the U.S. and metric systems ; and comparing degrees Fahrenheit and Celsius in real-life situations.

[ 9 ] Those concepts are taught in elementary-level education.
