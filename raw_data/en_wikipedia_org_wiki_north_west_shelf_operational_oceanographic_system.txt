[ 1 ] NOOS is operated by partners from the nine countries bordering the extended North Sea and European North West Shelf ; Belgium , Denmark , France , Germany , Ireland , Netherlands , Norway , Sweden , and United Kingdom . Working collaboratively to develop and implement ocean observing systems in the area.

[ 1 ] Near real time and recent history sea levels are available to on their web site in map , graph or table format.

[ 1 ] Membership [ edit ] As of January 2008 NOOS had sixteen full members and four associate members.
