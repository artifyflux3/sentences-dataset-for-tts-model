It was released on April 21, 2015, by Interscope Records , Shady Records and Slumerican . The album was described by Yelawolf as a more passionate album than his debut album. Recording process took place primarily in Nashville, Tennessee from 2012 to 2015. The production on the album was handled by Yelawolf himself, along with Eminem (who also served as the executive producer), Malay and WLPWR , among others. The album was influenced by aspects of country and rock .

Love Story was supported by five singles: " Box Chevy V ", " Till It's Gone ", " Whiskey in a Bottle ", "American You" and " Best Friend " featuring Eminem.

Love Story received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised the album's emotional feel as well as its ambition and production, but criticized its length. The album debuted at number three on the US Billboard 200 , selling 51,000 copies in its first week.

Background [ edit ] In April 2012, Yelawolf said, "The focus of the album is the experience since Radioactive (2011) and just putting all that into a project." [ 1 ] He also spoke about Love Story , and how it would be different compared to his debut effort Radioactive . He said, "With Radioactive , I gave up a lot of creative space, and like I predicted would happen, there were some records that didn't translate to my audience." [ 2 ] Yelawolf also said this album contains more straight up passion in the songs and there is no guidelines for the album.

[ 3 ] He also said, "I'm telling the truth about a lot of things. This album is in line with it having a concept and a theme. This is what makes my music special and makes me want to keep making music. I try to be as honest as I can with everything I do." [ 4 ] Release and promotion [ edit ] Following the release of his debut album, Radioactive (2011), Yelawolf had been touring with Lil Wayne and Travis Barker on the I Am Music Tour.

[ 25 ] Critical reception [ edit ] Professional ratings Aggregate scores Source Rating Metacritic 64/100 [ 26 ] Review scores Source Rating AllMusic [ 27 ] Complex [ 28 ] HipHopDX 3.5/5 [ 29 ] Pitchfork 4.9/10 [ 30 ] RapReviews 6/10 [ 31 ] Rolling Stone [ 32 ] Spin 6/10 [ 33 ] XXL 4/5 [ 34 ] Love Story was met with generally positive reviews. At Metacritic , which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 64, based on 10 reviews.

[ 26 ] Ken Capobianco of The Boston Globe gave the album a positive review while calling the album "a striking improvement over 2011's messy, compromised "Radioactive"....if you scratch his songs' surfaces, you hear a smart, sensitive outsider searching for some solace." He would go on to praise the album for its "undeniable emotional pull".

[ 35 ] Renato Pagnani of Rolling Stone calling the album a "stronger embrace of his southern roots", while also adding that "Yelawolf's populist ambitions haven't gone away." [ 32 ] Chris Mench of Complex saying "The album layers the trailer park swagger of his early work over rootsy country music instrumentals, and it's largely successful". He would go on to criticize the albums length by saying "If Love Story ended at its title song, it could have been a truly great project...its solid momentum really fizzles out in the last few songs, making for a disappointing finale of an otherwise solid effort".

[ 28 ] Marcus Dowling of HipHopDX said: "On Love Story , the effort, creativity and ambition is more than there, and his tremendous talents as an emcee and clear artistic voice are very much present." He would go on to say the album is "disjointed but not jagged...the closer Yelawolf stays to his more organic-to-his-roots style of Southern rap, he excels." [ 29 ] Miranda J. of XXL stating that Yelawolf is "in tune with his southern roots on Love Story ... there's a sense of self awareness and confidence that seems to have been missing before...He's fully aware of who exactly he wants to be in hip-hop: a proud, raw, unapologetically Southern MC, something the game’s been missing".

[ 34 ] In a mixed review, Drew Millard of Spin stated: "Nobody else has tried to mash murder ballads, hardcore rap, bluegrass, backwoods country, and feather-light guitar-pop into one album, pretty much ever ... Your enjoyment of Love Story will directly correlate with the amount that you enjoy Yelawolf's singing, because boy howdy is there a lot of it here". Millard additionally criticized Yelawolf's lyrics, including his usage of "the word 'faggot' multiple times on the record, which, come on, guy. It's 2015!" He added: "[W]henever he's got space in a verse to fill, it seems the guy drops some sort of complaint about the music industry".

[ 33 ] In a mostly negative review, Jay Balfour of Pitchfork wrote: " Love Story is far too long to accomplish so little ... Yelawolf sounds like he's just going through the motions instead of actually covering ground".

[ 30 ] Commercial performance [ edit ] In the United States, Love Story debuted at number three on the Billboard 200 , with 58,000 album-equivalent units ; it has sold 51,000 copies in its first week. It marked as Yelawolf's first top ten entry on the Billboard 200, his first number one album on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums , and the best sales week of his career so far.

[ 36 ] [ 37 ] The album dropped to number 15 in its second week, selling 14,000 copies.

[ 38 ] As of January 2016, the album has sold 119,000.
