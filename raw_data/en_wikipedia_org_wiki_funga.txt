In life sciences , "funga" is a recent term (2000s) for the kingdom fungi similar to the longstanding fauna for animals and flora for plants. The term seeks to simplify projects oriented toward implementation of educational and conservation goals. It highlights parallel terminology referring to treatments of these macroorganisms in particular geographical areas. An official proposal for the term occurred in 2018, despite previous use.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] The Species Survival Commission (SSC) of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in August 2021 called for the recognition of fungi as one of three kingdoms of life, and critical to protecting and restoring Earth.

Funga was recommended by the IUCN in 2021. They ask that the phrase animals and plants be replaced by animals, fungi, and plants , and fauna and flora by fauna, flora, and funga .

The IUCN Species Survival Commission calls for the due recognition of fungi as major components of biodiversity in legislation and policy. It fully endorses the Fauna Flora Funga Initiative and asks that the phrases animals and plants and fauna and flora be replaced with animals, fungi, and plants and fauna, flora, and funga .
