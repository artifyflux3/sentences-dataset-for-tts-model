They are named after the Japanese mathematician Katsuei Kenmotsu.

Definitions [ edit ] Let ( M , φ φ , ξ ξ , η η ) {\displaystyle (M,\varphi ,\xi ,\eta )} be an almost-contact manifold . One says that a Riemannian metric g {\displaystyle g} on M {\displaystyle M} is adapted to the almost-contact structure ( φ φ , ξ ξ , η η ) {\displaystyle (\varphi ,\xi ,\eta )} if: g i j ξ ξ j = η η i g p q φ φ i p φ φ j q = g i j − − η η i η η j .

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}g_{ij}\xi ^{j}&=\eta _{i}\\g_{pq}\varphi _{i}^{p}\varphi _{j}^{q}&=g_{ij}-\eta _{i}\eta _{j}.\end{aligned}}} That is to say that, relative to g p , {\displaystyle g_{p},} the vector ξ ξ p {\displaystyle \xi _{p}} has length one and is orthogonal to ker ⁡ ⁡ ( η η p ) ; {\displaystyle \ker \left(\eta _{p}\right);} furthermore the restriction of g p {\displaystyle g_{p}} to ker ⁡ ⁡ ( η η p ) {\displaystyle \ker \left(\eta _{p}\right)} is a Hermitian metric relative to the almost-complex structure φ φ p | ker ⁡ ⁡ ( η η p ) .

{\displaystyle \varphi _{p}{\big \vert }_{\ker \left(\eta _{p}\right)}.} One says that ( M , φ φ , ξ ξ , η η , g ) {\displaystyle (M,\varphi ,\xi ,\eta ,g)} is an almost-contact metric manifold .

[ 1 ] An almost-contact metric manifold ( M , φ φ , ξ ξ , η η , g ) {\displaystyle (M,\varphi ,\xi ,\eta ,g)} is said to be a Kenmotsu manifold if [ 2 ] ∇ ∇ i φ φ j k = − − η η j φ φ i k − − g i p φ φ j p ξ ξ k .

{\displaystyle \nabla _{i}\varphi _{j}^{k}=-\eta _{j}\varphi _{i}^{k}-g_{ip}\varphi _{j}^{p}\xi ^{k}.} References [ edit ] ^ Blair 2010 , p. 44.
