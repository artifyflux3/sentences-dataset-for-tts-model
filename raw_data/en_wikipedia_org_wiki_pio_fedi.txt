[ 1 ] Biography [ edit ] He was born to Leopoldo Fedi, a small landowner, and his wife, Camilla née Franchini. Due to economic difficulties, they left Viterbo when he still quite young; living in Arezzo and Florence. There, he worked for a goldsmith . This led to lessons in engraving from Raffaello Sanzio Morghen and Giovita Garavaglia . From 1838 to 1840, he lived in Vienna with his father and continued his studies at the Academy of Fine Arts , but he was forced to abandon that potential career due to eye problems caused by the acid fumes.

[ 2 ] After returning to Florence, from 1842 to 1846 he studied sculpture with Lorenzo Bartolini at the Academy of Fine Arts . There, he obtained a scholarship that enabled him to study in Rome at the Accademia di San Luca . His primary instructor there was Pietro Tenerani . One his first independent works, a plaster relief of "Christ the Healer", is preserved at San Luca. In 1873, the Accademia named him an "Academician of Merit".

[ 2 ] His most familiar sculpture is the Rape of Polyxena (1866), in the Loggia dei Lanzi . He is also known for two sculptures in the Loggiato degli Uffizi depicting the illustrious Tuscans, Nicola Pisano and Andrea Cesalpino . His other works include The Fury of Atamante, King of Thebes , The Genius of Fishing , Hope Nourishing Love , Hyppolite and Dianora del Bardi , and Castalla persecuted by Apollon .

[ 3 ] In addition, he designed the Monument to General Manfredo Fanti , molded in bronze by Clemente Papi [ it ] , which stands in the Piazza San Marco .

[ 3 ] His memorial to the poet Giovanni Battista Niccolini is in the church of Santa Croce . The statue, an allegory of the Freedom of Poetry , may have inspired Bartholdi 's depiction of the Statue of Liberty .

[ 4 ] He also created a statue of Pietro Torrigiani , the Mayor of Florence.

From 1842, he had a studio at 99 Via dei Serragli [ it ] , in an old monastery. Currently an actor's training school, it is still known as the Galleria Pio Fedi [ it ] . One of his best known students was Giovanni Bastianini .
