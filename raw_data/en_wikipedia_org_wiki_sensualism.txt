( September 2024 ) Epistemological position In epistemology , sensualism is a doctrine whereby sensations and perception are the basic and most important form of true cognition . It may oppose abstract ideas.

[ 1 ] This ideogenetic question was long ago put forward in Greek philosophy ( Stoicism , Epicureanism ) and further developed to the full by the British Sensualists ( John Locke , David Hume ) and the British Associationists ( Thomas Brown , David Hartley , Joseph Priestley ). In the 19th century, it was very much taken up by the Positivists ( Auguste Comte , Herbert Spencer , Hippolyte Taine , Émile Littré ) [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ better source needed ] See also [ edit ] Empiricism Positivism Solipsism Spiritualism Footnotes [ edit ] ^ José Ortega y Gasset ; Julián Marías (2000).

^ According to Schopenhauer , this judgment was attributed to Aristotle . Schopenhauer presents the Latin version as Nihil est in intellectu nisi quod antea fuerit in sensu . See The World as Will and Representation , Volume II, Chapter VII. It is possible that it was mentioned by the Stoic Cicero and was repeated by Augustine of Hippo and Thomas Aquinas .
