History [ edit ] DSIR was founded in 1926 by Ernest Marsden [ 1 ] after calls from Ernest Rutherford for government to support education and research [ 2 ] and on the back of the Imperial Economic Conference in London in October and November 1923, when various colonies discussed setting up such departments.

[ 3 ] It initially received funding from sources such as the Empire Marketing Board .

[ 4 ] The initial plans also included a new agricultural college, to be jointly founded by Auckland and Victoria University Colleges , Palmerston North was chosen as the site for this and it grew to become Massey University .

[ 5 ] It was reconstituted into 10 semi-independent entities called Crown Research Institutes by the Crown Research Institutes Act 1992, with some further consolidation since.

[ 6 ] Structure [ edit ] DSIR initially had five divisions: [ 7 ] Grasslands in Palmerston North Plant Diseases in Auckland Entomology, attached to the Cawthron Institute in Nelson Soil Survey (later Soil Bureau ) in Taita Agronomy (later Crop Research Division) in Lincoln The Grasslands Division originally included the New Zealand Dairy Research Institute, which became the Fonterra Research and Development Centre in 2001.

[ 8 ] The Geophysics Division was established in 1951.

[ 9 ] The Antarctic Division was established in 1959 [ 10 ] and became Antarctica New Zealand in 1996.
