( May 2022 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Thermoeconomics , also referred to as Bioeconomics or Biophysical Economics , is a school of heterodox economics that applies the laws of statistical mechanics to economic theory.

[ 1 ] Thermoeconomics is considered the statistical physics of economic value [ 2 ] and is one subfield of econophysics , extenuating to Ecological Economics.

It is the study of the ways and means by which human societies procure and use energy and other biological and physical resources to produce, distribute, consume and exchange goods and services, while generating various types of waste and environmental impacts.

Biophysical economics builds on both social sciences and natural sciences to overcome some of the most fundamental limitations and blind spots of conventional economics. It makes it possible to understand some key requirements and framework conditions for economic growth, as well as related constraints and boundaries.

[ 3 ] Thermodynamics [ edit ] "Rien ne se perd, rien ne se crée, tout se transforme" "Nothing is lost, nothing is created, everything is transformed." - Antoine Lavoisier , one of the fathers of chemistry Thermoeconomists maintain that human economic systems can be modeled as thermodynamic systems .  Thermoeconomists argue that economic systems always involve matter , energy , entropy , and information .

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] Then, based on this premise, theoretical economic analogs of the first and second laws of thermodynamics are developed.

[ 6 ] The global economy is viewed as an open system .

Moreover, many economic activities result in the formation of structures .  Thermoeconomics applies the statistical mechanics of non-equilibrium thermodynamics to model these activities.

[ 1 ] In thermodynamic terminology, human economic activity may be described as a dissipative system , which flourishes by consuming free energy in transformations and exchange of resources, goods, and services.

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] A comprehensive and accurate model of how real economic systems work Energy Return on Investment [ edit ] E R O I = Energy returned to society Energy required to get that energy {\displaystyle EROI={\frac {\text{Energy returned to society}}{\text{Energy required to get that energy}}}} Thermoeconomics is based on the proposition that the role of energy in biological evolution should be defined and understood not through the second law of thermodynamics but in terms of such economic criteria as productivity , efficiency , and especially the costs and benefits (or profitability) of the various mechanisms for capturing and utilizing available energy to build biomass and do work.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ dubious – discuss ] Quality EROI Peak oil [ edit ] Current US/Global Oil/Energy situation. The Y-axis is the production (and availability) of fossil fuels.

Political Implications [ edit ] "[T]he escalation of social protest and political instability around the world is causally related to the unstoppable thermodynamics of global hydrocarbon energy decline and its interconnected environmental and economic consequences." [ 11 ] Energy Backed Credit [ edit ] Under this analysis, a reduction of GDP in advanced economies is now likely: when we can no longer access consumption via adding credit, and with a shift towards lower quality and more costly energy and resources.

The 20th  century experienced increasing energy quality and decreasing energy prices. The 21st century will be a story of decreasing energy quality and increasing energy cost.
