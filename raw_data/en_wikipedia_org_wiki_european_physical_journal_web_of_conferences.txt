It arose in 1998 as a merger and continuation of Acta Physica Hungarica , Anales de Física , Czechoslovak Journal of Physics , Il Nuovo Cimento , Journal de Physique , Portugaliae Physica and Zeitschrift für Physik . The journal is published in various sections, covering all areas of physics .

History [ edit ] In the late 1990s, Springer and EDP Sciences decided to merge Zeitschrift für Physik and Journal de Physique . With the addition of Il Nuovo Cimento from the Societa Italiana di Fisica, the European Physical Journal commenced publication in January 1998. Now EPJ is a merger and continuation of Acta Physica Hungarica , Anales de Fisica , Czechoslovak Journal of Physics , Il Nuovo Cimento , Journal de Physique , Portugaliae Physica and Zeitschrift für Physik .

The short-lived open-access journal family PhysMath Central [ 1 ] was merged in 2011 into the European Physical Journal , [ 2 ] which has offered an open-access option since 2006.

[ 3 ] Topics covered [ edit ] The EPJ is published in the following sections: European Physical Journal A : Hadrons and Nuclei European Physical Journal AM European Physical Journal AM : Applied Metamaterials European Physical Journal AP European Physical Journal AP : Applied Physics European Physical Journal B : Condensed Matter and Complex Systems European Physical Journal C : Particles and Fields European Physical Journal D : Atomic, Molecular, Optical and Plasma Physics European Physical Journal Data Science European Physical Journal Data Science : Data Science European Physical Journal E : Soft Matter and Biological Physics European Physical Journal H : Historical Perspectives on Contemporary Physics European Physical Journal N European Physical Journal N : Nuclear Sciences and Technologies European Physical Journal NBP European Physical Journal NBP : Nonlinear Biomedical Physics European Physical Journal Plus European Physical Journal Plus European Physical Journal PV European Physical Journal PV : Photovoltaics European Physical Journal QT European Physical Journal QT : Quantum Technology European Physical Journal ST European Physical Journal ST : Special Topics European Physical Journal TI European Physical Journal TI : Techniques and Instrumentation European Physical Journal WOC European Physical Journal WOC : Web of Conferences : journal of conference proceedings [ 4 ] Controversies [ edit ] In 2023, editors retracted a journal article published in 2022 in European Physical Journal Plus that claimed to have found no evidence of climate change.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] The article was widely shared with article metrics showing that the article was in the 99th percentile (ranked 293rd) of the 512,033 tracked articles of a similar age in all journals, and in the 99th percentile (ranked 1st) of the 41 tracked articles of a similar age in European Physical Journal Plus .

[ 7 ] The article was cited by climate change denialists and in two segments on Sky News Australia (known for climate science misinformation).

[ 6 ] The retraction note does not highlight any error, data or image falsification, plagiarism or other reasons that usually justify a retraction: for a reconstruction of what happened, see [ 8 ] and [ 9 ] where also the reviewers notes can be found.
