For Plato's dialogue, see Menexenus (dialogue) . For the genus of stick insects, see Menexenus (phasmid) . For the genus of robber flies, see Menexenus (fly) .

Menexenus ( / m ə ˈ n ɛ k s ə n ə s / ; Greek : Μενέξενоς ) was one of the three sons of Socrates and Xanthippe . His two brothers were Lamprocles and Sophroniscus.  Menexenus is not to be confused with the character of the same name who appears in Plato 's dialogues Menexenus and Lysis .  Socrates' sons Menexenus and Sophroniscus were still children at the time of their father's trial and death , [ 1 ] one of them small enough to be held in his mother's arms.

[ 2 ] According to Aristotle , Socrates' descendants all turned out to be unremarkable "fools and dullards".
