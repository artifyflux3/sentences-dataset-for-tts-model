[ 2 ] He is considered one of the first Sufis as well as one of the first philosophers of al-Andalus .

[ 3 ] Ibn Masarra was born in Córdoba in 883.

[ 4 ] He is believed to have been Muwallad .

[ 5 ] In his youth, he travelled to Kairouan and Mecca before settling in the Sierra Morena near his home town. This is the origin of his nickname, al-Jabali ('the mountain-dweller'). After his death in 931, his followers were accused of heresy and forced to publicly recant his teachings by the Umayyad authorities. In at least one case, his books were burnt.
