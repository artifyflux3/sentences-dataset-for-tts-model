The current president is Wil Schilders. The cash award for each of the prizes [ 1 ] is 5000 USD.

[ 2 ] History [ edit ] Until 1999 the Council was known as the Committee for International Conferences on Industrial and Applied Mathematics (CICIAM). Formed in 1987 with the start of the ICIAM conference series, this committee represented the leaders of four applied mathematics societies: the Gesellschaft für Angewandte Mathematik und Mechanik (GAMM), in Germany, the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications (IMA), in England, the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM), in the USA, and the Société de Mathématiques Appliquées et Industrielles (SMAI), in France. The first two presidents of the council, Roger Temam and Reinhard Mennicken , oversaw the addition of several other societies as members and associate members of the council; as of 2015 it had 21 full members and 26 associate members. Past Presidents include Olavi Nevanlinna , Ian Sloan , Rolf Jeltsch , Barbara Keyfitz , [ 3 ] and María J. Esteban .

Congress [ edit ] ICIAM organizes the four-yearly International Congress on Industrial and Applied Mathematics , the first of which was held in 1987. The most recent congress was in 2019 in Valencia (Spain), and the next will be in 2023 in Tokyo (Japan). It also sponsors several prizes, awarded at the congresses: the Lagrange Prize for exceptional career contributions, the Collatz Prize for outstanding applied mathematicians under the age of 42, the Pioneer Prize for applied mathematical work in a new field, the Maxwell Prize for originality in applied mathematics, and the Su Buchin Prize for outstanding contributions to emerging economies and human development.

[ 2 ] Collatz Prize [ edit ] The Collatz Prize is awarded by ICIAM every four years at the International Congress on Industrial and Applied Mathematics , to an applied mathematician under the age of 42. It was established in 1999 on the initiative of Gesellschaft für Angewandte Mathematik und Mechanik (GAMM), to recognize outstanding contributions in applied and industrial mathematics.

[ 2 ] Named after the German mathematician Lothar Collatz , it is widely regarded as one of the most prestigious prizes for young applied mathematicians.
