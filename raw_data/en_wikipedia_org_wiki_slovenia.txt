Slovenia , [ a ] officially the Republic of Slovenia , [ b ] is a country in Central Europe .

[ 13 ] [ 14 ] It borders Italy to the west, Austria to the north, Hungary to the northeast, Croatia to the south and southeast, and a short (46.6 km) coastline within the Adriatic Sea to the southwest, which is part of the Mediterranean Sea .

[ 15 ] Slovenia is mostly mountainous and forested, [ 16 ] covers 20,271 square kilometres (7,827 sq mi), [ 17 ] and has a population of approximately 2.1 million people.

[ 18 ] Slovene is the official language.

[ 19 ] Slovenia has a predominantly temperate continental climate , [ 20 ] with the exception of the Slovene Littoral and the Julian Alps .

Ljubljana , the capital and largest city of Slovenia, is geographically situated near the centre of the country.

[ 21 ] Other larger urban centers are Maribor , Ptuj , Kranj , Celje , and Koper .

Slovenia's territory has been part of many different states: the Byzantine Empire , the Carolingian Empire , the Holy Roman Empire , the Kingdom of Hungary , the Republic of Venice , the Illyrian Provinces of Napoleon's First French Empire and the Habsburg Empire .

[ 15 ] In October 1918, the Slovenes co-founded the State of Slovenes, Croats, and Serbs .

[ 22 ] In December 1918, they merged with the Kingdom of Montenegro and the Kingdom of Serbia into the Kingdom of Yugoslavia .

[ 23 ] During World War II , Germany , Italy , and Hungary occupied and annexed Slovenia, with a tiny area transferred to the Independent State of Croatia , a newly declared Nazi puppet state .

[ 24 ] In 1945, it again became part of Yugoslavia . Post-war, Yugoslavia was allied with the Eastern Bloc , but after the Tito–Stalin split of 1948, it never subscribed to the Warsaw Pact , and in 1961 it became one of the founders of the Non-Aligned Movement .

[ 25 ] In June 1991, Slovenia declared independence from Yugoslavia and became an independent sovereign state .

[ 2 ] Slovenia is a developed country , with a high-income economy characterized by a mixture of both traditional industries, such as manufacturing and agriculture, and modern sectors, such as information technology and financial services. The economy is highly dependent on foreign trade, with exports accounting for a significant portion of the country's GDP. Slovenia is a member of the Council of Europe , the European Union , the United Nations , NATO , the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe , and other associations in the global community.

Etymology [ edit ] The name Slovenia etymologically means 'land of the Slavs '. The origin of the name Slav itself remains uncertain. The suffix -en forms a demonym .

[ 26 ] History [ edit ] Main article: History of Slovenia Prehistory to Slavic settlement [ edit ] Prehistory [ edit ] A pierced cave bear bone , possibly a flute made by Neanderthals dating to the Late Pleistocene The Ljubljana Marshes Wheel , dating to the Neolithic period, is the oldest wooden wheel yet discovered.

Present-day Slovenia has been inhabited since prehistoric times. There is evidence of human habitation from around 250,000 years ago.

[ 27 ] A pierced cave bear bone , dating from 43100 ± 700 BP , found in 1995 in Divje Babe cave near Cerkno , is considered a kind of flute, and possibly the oldest musical instrument discovered in the world.

[ 28 ] In the 1920s and 1930s, artifacts belonging to the Cro-Magnon , such as pierced bones, bone points, and a needle were found by archaeologist Srečko Brodar in Potok Cave .

[ 29 ] [ 30 ] In 2002, remains of pile dwellings over 4,500 years old were discovered in the Ljubljana Marsh , now protected as a UNESCO World Heritage Site , along with the Ljubljana Marshes Wooden Wheel , the oldest wooden wheel in the world.

[ 31 ] It shows that wooden wheels appeared almost simultaneously in Mesopotamia and Europe.

[ 32 ] In the transition period between the Bronze Age to the Iron Age , the Urnfield culture flourished. Archaeological remains dating from the Hallstatt period have been found, particularly in southeastern Slovenia, among them a number of situlas in Novo Mesto , the " Town of Situlas ".

[ 33 ] Roman era [ edit ] In Roman times, the area that is now Slovenia was shared between Venetia et Histria (region X of Roman Italia in the classification of Augustus ) and the provinces Pannonia and Noricum . The Romans established posts at Emona (Ljubljana), Poetovio (Ptuj), and Celeia (Celje); and constructed trade and military roads that ran across Slovene territory from Italy to Pannonia. In the 5th and 6th centuries, the area was subject to invasions by the Huns and Germanic tribes during their incursions into Italy. Part of the inner state was protected with a defensive line of towers and walls called Claustra Alpium Iuliarum . A crucial battle between Theodosius I and Eugenius took place in the Vipava Valley in 394.

[ 34 ] [ 35 ] Slavic settlement [ edit ] The Slavic tribes migrated to the Alpine area after the westward departure of the Lombards (the last Germanic tribe) in 568, and, under pressure from Avars , established a Slavic settlement in the Eastern Alps . From 623 to 624 or possibly 626 onwards, King Samo united the Alpine and Western Slavs against the Avars and Germanic peoples and established what is referred to as Samo's Kingdom. After its disintegration following Samo's death in 658 or 659, the ancestors of the Slovenes located in present-day Carinthia formed the independent duchy of Carantania , [ 36 ] and Carniola , later duchy Carniola. Other parts of present-day Slovenia were again ruled by Avars before Charlemagne 's victory over them in 803.

Middle Ages [ edit ] A depiction of an ancient democratic ritual of Slovene-speaking tribes, which took place on the Prince's Stone in Slovene until 1414 The Carantanians , one of the ancestral groups of the modern Slovenes, particularly the Carinthian Slovenes , were the first Slavic people to accept Christianity . They were mostly Christianized by Irish missionaries, among them Modestus , known as the "Apostle of Carantanians". This process, together with the Christianization of the Bavarians , was later described in the memorandum known as the Conversio Bagoariorum et Carantanorum , which is thought [ by whom?

] to have overemphasized the role of the Church of Salzburg in the Christianization process over similar efforts of the Patriarchate of Aquileia .

In the mid-8th century, Carantania became a vassal duchy under the rule of the Bavarians , who began spreading Christianity . Three decades later, the Carantanians were incorporated, together with the Bavarians, into the Carolingian Empire . During the same period Carniola , too, came under the Franks, and was Christianised from Aquileia . Following the anti-Frankish rebellion of Liudewit at the beginning of the 9th century, the Franks removed the Carantanian princes, replacing them with their own border dukes. Consequently, the Frankish feudal system reached the Slovene territory.

After the victory of Emperor Otto I over the Magyars in 955, Slovene territory was divided into a number of border regions of the Holy Roman Empire . Carantania was elevated into the Duchy of Carinthia in 976.

By the 11th century, the Germanization of what is now Lower Austria , effectively isolated the Slovene-inhabited territory from the other western Slavs , speeding up the development of the Slavs of Carantania and of Carniola into an independent Carantanian/Carniolans/Slovene ethnic group. By the High Middle Ages , the historic provinces of Carniola, Styria , Carinthia , Gorizia , Trieste , and Istria developed from the border regions and were incorporated into the medieval Holy Roman Empire . The consolidation and formation of these historical lands took place in a long period between the 11th and 14th centuries, and were led by a number of important feudal families, such as the Dukes of Spanheim , the Counts of Gorizia , the Counts of Celje , and, finally, the House of Habsburg . In a parallel process, an intensive Germanization significantly diminished the extent of Slovene-speaking areas. By the 15th century, the Slovene ethnic territory was reduced to its present size.

[ 37 ] In 1335, Henry of Gorizia , Duke of Carinthia, Landgrave of Carniola and Count of Tyrol, died without a male heir. His daughter Margaret was able to keep the County of Tyrol , while the Wittelsbach emperor Louis IV passed Carinthia and the Carniolan march to the Habsburg duke Albert II of Austria , whose mother, Elisabeth of Carinthia , was a sister of the late duke Henry of Gorizia . Therefore, most of the territory of present-day Slovenia became a hereditary land of the Habsburg monarchy . As with the other component parts of the Habsburg monarchy , Carinthia and Carniola remained a semi-autonomous state with its own constitutional structure for a long time. The counts of Celje , a feudal family from this area who in 1436 acquired the title of state princes, were powerful competitors of the house of Habsburg for some time. This large dynasty, important at a European political level, had its seat in Slovene territory but died out in 1456. Its numerous large estates subsequently became the property of the Habsburgs, who retained control of the area right up until the beginning of the 20th century.

Patria del Friuli ruled present western Slovenia until Venetian takeover in 1420.

The Ottoman army battling the Habsburgs in present-day Slovenia during the Great Turkish War At the end of the Middle Ages, the Slovene Lands suffered a serious economic and demographic setback because of the Turkish raids . In 1515, a peasant revolt spread across nearly the whole Slovene territory. In 1572 and 1573 the Croatian-Slovenian peasant revolt wrought havoc throughout the wider region. Such uprisings, which often met with bloody defeats, continued throughout the 17th century.

[ 37 ] Early modern period [ edit ] After the dissolution of the Republic of Venice in 1797 , the Venetian Slovenia was passed to the Austrian Empire. The Slovene Lands were successively part of the French-administered Illyrian Provinces established by Napoleon , the Austrian Empire , and Austria-Hungary . Slovenes inhabited most of Carniola , the southern part of the duchies of Carinthia and Styria , the northern and eastern areas of the Austrian Littoral , as well as Prekmurje in the Kingdom of Hungary .

[ 38 ] Industrialization was accompanied by construction of railroads to link cities and markets, but the urbanization was limited.

Due to limited opportunities, between 1880 and 1910 there was extensive emigration; around 300,000 Slovenes (1 in 6) emigrated to other countries, [ 39 ] mostly to the US , but also to South America (the main part to Argentina ), Germany, Egypt , and to larger cities in Austria-Hungary, especially Vienna and Graz . Despite this emigration, the population of Slovenia increased significantly.

[ 39 ] Literacy was exceptionally high, at 80–90%.

[ 39 ] The 19th century also saw a revival of culture in Slovene , accompanied by a Romantic nationalist quest for cultural and political autonomy. The idea of a United Slovenia , first advanced during the revolutions of 1848 , became the common platform of most Slovenian parties and political movements in Austria-Hungary. During the same period, Yugoslavism , an ideology stressing the unity of all South Slavic peoples , spread as a reaction to Pan-German nationalism and Italian irredentism .

World War I [ edit ] See also: Italian front (World War I) , Battles of the Isonzo , Treaty of London (1915) , and Corfu Declaration The Battles of the Isonzo took place mostly in rugged mountainous areas above the Soča River.

World War I brought heavy casualties to Slovenes, particularly the twelve Battles of the Isonzo , which took place in present-day Slovenia's western border area with Italy. Hundreds of thousands of Slovene conscripts were drafted into the Austro-Hungarian Army , and over 30,000 of them died. Hundreds of thousands of Slovenes from Princely County of Gorizia and Gradisca were resettled in refugee camps in Italy and Austria. While the refugees in Austria received decent treatment, the Slovene refugees in Italian camps were treated as state enemies, and several thousand died of malnutrition and diseases between 1915 and 1918.

[ 40 ] Entire areas of the Slovene Littoral were destroyed.

The Treaty of Rapallo of 1920 left approximately 327,000 out of the total population of 1.3 million Slovenes in Italy.

[ 41 ] [ 42 ] After the fascists took power in Italy, they were subjected to a policy of violent Fascist Italianization . This caused the mass emigration of Slovenes, especially the middle class, from the Slovene Littoral and Trieste to Yugoslavia and South America. Those who remained organized several connected networks of both passive and armed resistance. The best known was the militant anti-fascist organization TIGR , formed in 1927 to fight Fascist oppression of the Slovene and Croat populations in the Julian March .

[ 43 ] [ 44 ] Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes (later the Kingdom of Yugoslavia) [ edit ] See also: Creation of Yugoslavia , Carinthian Plebiscite , and Rudolf Maister The proclamation of the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs at Congress Square in Ljubljana on 29 October 1918 The Slovene People's Party launched a movement for self-determination, demanding the creation of a semi-independent South Slavic state under Habsburg rule. The proposal was picked up by most Slovene parties, and a mass mobilization of Slovene civil society, known as the Declaration Movement , followed.

[ 45 ] This demand was rejected by the Austrian political elites; but following the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in the aftermath of the First World War , the National Council of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs took power in Zagreb on 6 October 1918. On 29 October, independence was declared by a national gathering in Ljubljana, and by the Croatian parliament, declaring the establishment of the new State of Slovenes, Croats, and Serbs .

On 1 December 1918, the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs merged with Serbia , becoming part of the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes ; in 1929 it was renamed the Kingdom of Yugoslavia . The main territory of Slovenia, being the most industrialized and westernized compared to other less developed parts of Yugoslavia, became the main centre of industrial production: Compared to Serbia, for example, Slovenian industrial production was four times greater; and it was 22 times greater than in North Macedonia . The interwar period brought further industrialization in Slovenia, with rapid economic growth in the 1920s, followed by a relatively successful economic adjustment to the 1929 economic crisis and Great Depression .

Following a plebiscite in October 1920, the Slovene-speaking southern Carinthia was ceded to Austria . With the Treaty of Trianon , the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was awarded the mostly Slovene-inhabited Prekmurje region, formerly part of Austria-Hungary. Slovenes living in territories that fell under the rule of the neighboring states—Italy, Austria, and Hungary—were subjected to assimilation .

World War II [ edit ] Main article: World War II in the Slovene Lands Nazi Germany Hungary Fascist Italy Independent State of Croatia During World War II, Nazi Germany and Hungary annexed northern areas (brown and dark green areas, respectively), while Fascist Italy annexed the vertically hatched black area (solid black western part having been annexed by Italy in 1920 with the Treaty of Rapallo ). Some villages were incorporated into the Independent State of Croatia . After 1943, Germany also occupied the area that Italy had annexed.

Slovenia was the only present-day European nation that was trisected and completely annexed into both Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy during World War II.

[ 46 ] In addition, the Prekmurje region in the east was annexed to Hungary, and some villages in the Lower Sava Valley were incorporated in the newly created Nazi puppet Independent State of Croatia (NDH). Axis forces invaded Yugoslavia in April 1941 and defeated the country in a few weeks. The southern part, including Ljubljana , was annexed to Italy, while the Nazis took over the northern and eastern parts of the country. The Nazis had a plan of ethnic cleansing of these areas, [ 47 ] and they resettled or expelled the local Slovene civilian population to the puppet states of Nedić's Serbia (7,500) and NDH (10,000). In addition, some 46,000 Slovenes were expelled to Germany, including children who were separated from their parents and allocated to German families.

[ 48 ] [ 49 ] At the same time, the ethnic Germans in the Gottschee enclave in the Italian annexation zone were resettled to the Nazi-controlled areas cleansed of their Slovene population.

[ 50 ] Around 30,000 to 40,000 Slovene men were drafted to the German Army and sent to the Eastern front. Slovene was banned from education, and its use in public life was limited.

[ 46 ] In south-central Slovenia, annexed by Fascist Italy and renamed the Province of Ljubljana , the Slovenian National Liberation Front was organized in April 1941. Led by the Communist Party, it formed the Slovene Partisan units as part of the Yugoslav Partisans led by the Communist leader Josip Broz Tito .

[ 51 ] [ 52 ] After the resistance started in summer 1941, Italian violence against the Slovene civilian population escalated. The Italian authorities deported some 25,000 people to concentration camps , which equaled 7.5% of the population of their occupation zone. The most infamous ones were Rab and Gonars . To counter the Communist-led insurgence, the Italians sponsored local anti-guerrilla units, formed mostly by the local conservative Catholic Slovene population that resented the revolutionary violence of the partisans. After the Italian armistice of September 1943, the Germans took over both the Province of Ljubljana and the Slovenian Littoral, incorporating them into what was known as the Operation Zone of Adriatic Coastal Region . They united the Slovene anti-Communist counter-insurgence into the Slovene Home Guard and appointed a puppet regime in the Province of Ljubljana. The anti-Nazi resistance however expanded, creating its own administrative structures as the basis for Slovene statehood within a new, federal and socialist Yugoslavia.

[ 53 ] [ 54 ] In 1945, Yugoslavia was liberated by the partisan resistance and soon became a socialist federation known as the People's Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .

The first Slovenian republic , named Federal Slovenia , was a constituent republic of the Yugoslavian federation, led by its own pro-Communist leadership.

Approximately 8% of the Slovene population died during World War II . The small Jewish community, mostly in the Prekmurje region, was destroyed in 1944 in the holocaust of Hungarian Jews . The German-speaking minority, amounting to 2.5% of the Slovenian population prior to the war, was either expelled or killed in the aftermath of the war. Hundreds of Istrian Italians and Slovenes that were members of fascist and collaborationist forces, alongside civilians presumed to oppose communism, were killed in the foibe massacres , and more than 25,000 fled or were expelled from Slovenian Istria .

[ 55 ] [ 56 ] Around 130,000 persons, mostly political and military opponents, were executed in May and June 1945.

[ 57 ] Socialism [ edit ] During the re-establishment of Yugoslavia in World War II, the first Slovenian republic, Federal Slovenia , was created and it became part of Federal Yugoslavia . It was a socialist state , but because of the Tito–Stalin split in 1948, economic and personal freedoms were much broader than in the Eastern Bloc countries. In 1947, the Slovene Littoral and the western half of Inner Carniola , which had been annexed by Italy after World War One, were annexed to Slovenia.

SR Slovenia (dark green) was, along with SR Croatia and SAP Vojvodina (light green), the richest entity of SFR Yugoslavia .

After the failure of forced collectivisation that was attempted from 1949 to 1953, a policy of gradual economic liberalisation, known as workers self-management , was introduced under the advice and supervision of the Slovene Marxist theoretician and Communist leader Edvard Kardelj , the main ideologue of the Titoist path to socialism. Suspected opponents of this policy both from within and outside the Communist party were persecuted and thousands were sent to Goli otok (where also oponents from Tito-Stalin split , which developed at the same time, were sent).

The late 1950s saw a policy of liberalization in the cultural sphere as well, and unlimited border crossing into western countries was allowed, both for Yugoslav citizens and for foreigners. In 1956, Josip Broz Tito , together with other leaders, founded the Non-Aligned Movement . In the 1950s, Slovenia's economy developed rapidly and was strongly industrialized. With further economic decentralization of Yugoslavia in 1965–66, Slovenia's domestic product was 2.5 times the average of Yugoslav republics. While a Communist country, after the Tito–Stalin split Yugoslavia initiated a period of military neutrality and non-alignment. JAT Yugoslav Airlines was the flag carrier and during its existence it grew to become one of the leading airlines in Europe both by fleet and destinations. By the 1970s more airlines were created including Slovenian Adria Airways mostly focused in the growing tourist industry. Until the 1980s, Slovenia enjoyed relatively broad autonomy within the federation. It was the most liberal communist state in Europe, and the passport of the Yugoslavia Federation allowed Yugoslavians to travel to the most world countries of any socialist country during the Cold War. Many people worked in western countries, which reduced unemployment in their home country.

Opposition to the regime was mostly limited to intellectual and literary circles and became especially vocal after Tito's death in 1980 when the economic and political situation in Yugoslavia became very strained.

[ 37 ] Political disputes around economic measures were echoed in the public sentiment, as many Slovenians felt they were being economically exploited, having to sustain an expensive and inefficient federal administration.

Slovenian Spring, democracy and independence [ edit ] In 1987 a group of intellectuals demanded Slovene independence in the 57th edition of the magazine Nova revija . Demands for democratisation and more Slovenian independence were sparked off. A mass democratic movement, coordinated by the Committee for the Defence of Human Rights , pushed the Communists in the direction of democratic reforms.

In September 1989, numerous constitutional amendments were passed to introduce parliamentary democracy to Slovenia.

[ 58 ] [ 59 ] On 7 March 1990, the Slovenian Assembly changed the official name of the state to the "Republic of Slovenia".

[ 60 ] [ 61 ] In April 1990, the first democratic election in Slovenia took place, and the united opposition movement DEMOS led by Jože Pučnik emerged victorious.

Slovenian Territorial Defense Units counterattacking a Yugoslav People's Army tank which entered Slovenia during the Ten-Day War , 1991 The initial revolutionary events in Slovenia pre-dated the Revolutions of 1989 in Eastern Europe by almost a year, but went largely unnoticed by international observers. On 23 December 1990, more than 88% of the electorate voted for a sovereign and independent Slovenia.

[ 62 ] [ 63 ] On 25 June 1991, Slovenia became independent.

[ 2 ] [ 64 ] On 27 June in the early morning, the Yugoslav People's Army dispatched its forces to prevent further measures for the establishment of a new country, which led to the Ten-Day War .

[ 65 ] [ 66 ] On 7 July, the Brijuni Agreement was signed, implementing a truce and a three-month halt of the enforcement of Slovenia's independence.

[ 67 ] At the end of the month, the last soldiers of the Yugoslav Army left Slovenia.

In December 1991, a new constitution was adopted, [ 64 ] followed in 1992 by the laws on denationalisation and privatisation .

[ 68 ] The members of the European Union recognised Slovenia as an independent state on 15 January 1992, and the United Nations accepted it as a member on 22 May 1992.

[ 69 ] Slovenia joined the European Union on 1 May 2004.

[ 70 ] Slovenia has one Commissioner in the European Commission , and seven Slovene parliamentarians were elected to the European Parliament at elections on 13 June 2004. In 2004 Slovenia also joined NATO .

[ 71 ] Slovenia subsequently succeeded in meeting the Maastricht criteria and joined the Eurozone (the first transition country to do so) on 1 January 2007.

[ 72 ] It was the first post-Communist country to hold the Presidency of the Council of the European Union , for the first six months of 2008. On 21 July 2010, it became a member of the OECD.

[ 73 ] The disillusionment with domestic socio-economic elites at municipal and national levels was expressed at the 2012–2013 Slovenian protests on a wider scale than in the smaller 15 October 2011 protests .

[ 74 ] In relation to the leading politicians' response to allegations made by the official Commission for the Prevention of Corruption of the Republic of Slovenia , legal experts expressed the need for changes in the system that would limit political arbitrariness .

[ 75 ] [ needs context ] Geography [ edit ] Main article: Geography of Slovenia See also: Protected areas of Slovenia Slovenia is located in Central Europe touching the eastern Alps and bordering the Mediterranean Sea .

[ 76 ] [ 77 ] [ 78 ] This locates Slovenia within the Mediterranean basin .

[ 79 ] It lies between latitudes 45° and 47° N , and longitudes 13° and 17° E . The 15th meridian east almost corresponds to the middle line of the country in the direction west–east.

[ 80 ] The Geometric Centre of the Republic of Slovenia is located at coordinates 46°07'11.8" N and 14°48'55.2" E.

[ 81 ] It lies in Slivna in the Municipality of Litija .

[ 82 ] Slovenia's highest peak is Triglav (2,864 m or 9,396 ft); the country's average height above sea level is 557 m (1,827 ft): it has become a national symbol of Slovenia, featuring on the national coat of arms and flag .

Four major European geographic regions meet in Slovenia: the Alps, the Dinarides , the Pannonian Plain , and the Mediterranean Sea. Although on the shore of the Adriatic Sea near the Mediterranean Sea, most of Slovenia is in the Black Sea drainage basin . The Alps—including the Julian Alps , the Kamnik-Savinja Alps and the Karawank chain, as well as the Pohorje massif—dominate Northern Slovenia along its long border with Austria . Slovenia's Adriatic coastline stretches approximately 47 kilometres (29 mi) [ 83 ] from Italy to Croatia.

Mount Mangart , in the Julian Alps , is the third-highest peak in Slovenia, after Triglav and Škrlatica .

The term " Karst topography " refers to that of southwestern Slovenia's Karst Plateau , a limestone region of underground rivers, gorges, and caves, between Ljubljana and the Mediterranean Sea. On the Pannonian plain to the East and Northeast, toward the Croatian and Hungarian borders, the landscape is essentially flat. However, most of Slovenia is hilly or mountainous, with around 90% of its land surface 200 m (656 ft) or more above sea level .

More than half of Slovenia, which is 11,823 km 2 or 4,565 sq mi, is forested; [ 84 ] ranking it third in Europe, by percentage of area forested , after Finland and Sweden . The areas are covered mostly by beech , fir -beech and beech- oak forests and have a relatively high production capacity.

[ 85 ] Remnants of primeval forests are still to be found, the largest in the Kočevje area. Grassland covers 5,593 km 2 (2,159 sq mi) and fields and gardens (954 km 2 or 368 sq mi). There are 363 km 2 (140 sq mi) of orchards and 216 km 2 (83 sq mi) of vineyards.

[ citation needed ] Geology [ edit ] Solution runnels (also known as rillenkarren) are a karst feature on the Karst Plateau , as in many other karst areas of the world.

Slovenia is in a rather active seismic zone because of its position on the small Adriatic Plate , which is squeezed between the Eurasian Plate to the north and the African Plate to the south and rotates counter-clockwise.

[ 86 ] Thus the country is at the junction of three important geotectonic units: the Alps to the north, the Dinaric Alps to the south and the Pannonian Basin to the east.

[ 86 ] Scientists have been able to identify 60 destructive earthquakes in the past. Additionally, a network of seismic stations is active throughout the country.

[ 86 ] Many parts of Slovenia have a carbonate bedrock and extensive cave systems have developed.

Natural regions [ edit ] The first regionalisations of Slovenia were made by geographers Anton Melik (1935–1936) and Svetozar Ilešič (1968). The newer regionalisation by Ivan Gams divided Slovenia in the following macroregions: [ 87 ] Slovenian coast with cliffs the Alps ( Alpe ) the subalpine landscapes ( predalpski svet ) the Slovene Littoral or Submediterranean Slovenia ( Primorje or submediteranska Slovenija ) the Dinaric plateaus of the continental Slovenia ( dinarske planote celinske Slovenije ) Subpannonian Slovenia ( subpanonska Slovenija ) According to a newer natural geographic regionalisation, the country consists of four macroregions . These are the Alpine, the Mediterranean, the Dinaric, and the Pannonian landscapes. Macroregions are defined according to major relief units (the Alps, the Pannonian plain, the Dinaric mountains) and climate types (submediterranean, temperate continental, mountain climate).

[ 88 ] These are often quite interwoven.

Protected areas of Slovenia include national parks, regional parks, and nature parks, the largest of which is Triglav National Park . There are 286 Natura 2000 designated protected areas, which include 36% of the country's land area, the largest percentage among European Union states.

[ 89 ] Additionally, according to Yale University 's Environmental Performance Index , Slovenia is considered a "strong performer" in environmental protection efforts.

[ 90 ] Climate [ edit ] Climate types of Slovenia 1970–2000 and climographs for selected settlements Slovenia is located in temperate latitudes. The climate is also influenced by the variety of relief, and the influence of the Alps and the Adriatic Sea . In the northeast, the continental climate type with the greatest difference between winter and summer temperatures prevails. In the coastal region, there is a sub- Mediterranean climate . The effect of the sea on the temperature rates is also visible up the Soča Valley, while a severe Alpine climate is present in the high mountain regions. There is a strong interaction between these three climatic systems across most of the country.

[ 91 ] [ 92 ] Precipitation , often coming from the Gulf of Genoa , [ 93 ] varies across the country as well, with over 3,500 mm (138 in) in some western regions and dropping down to 800 mm (31 in) in Prekmurje . Snow is quite frequent in winter and the record snow cover in Ljubljana was recorded in 1952 at 146 cm (57 in).

Compared to Western Europe, Slovenia is not very windy, because it lies in the slipstream of the Alps. The average wind speeds are lower than in the plains of the nearby countries. Due to the rugged terrain, local vertical winds with daily periods are present. Besides these, there are three winds of particular regional importance: the bora , the jugo , and the foehn . The jugo and the bora are characteristic of the Littoral. Whereas the jugo is humid and warm, the bora is usually cold and gusty. The foehn is typical of the Alpine regions in the north of Slovenia. Generally present in Slovenia are the northeast wind, the southeast wind and the north wind .

[ 94 ] Waters [ edit ] Lake Bohinj , the largest Slovenian lake and one of the two headwaters of the Sava River The territory of Slovenia mainly (16,423 square kilometers or 6,341 square miles, i.e. 81%) belongs to the Black Sea basin, and a smaller part (3,850 square kilometers or 1,490 square miles, i.e. 19%) belongs to the Adriatic Sea basin. These two parts are divided into smaller units in regard to their central rivers, the Mura River basin, the Drava River basin, the Sava River basin with Kolpa River basin, and the basin of the Adriatic rivers.

[ 95 ] In comparison with other developed countries , water quality in Slovenia is considered to be among the highest in Europe. One of the reasons is undoubtedly that most of the rivers rise on the mountainous territory of Slovenia. However, this does not mean that Slovenia has no problems with surface water and groundwater quality, especially in areas with intensive farming .

[ 96 ] Biodiversity [ edit ] Olm can be found in the Postojna cave and other caves in the country.

Slovenia signed the Rio Convention on Biological Diversity on 13 June 1992 and became a party to the convention on 9 July 1996.

[ 97 ] It subsequently produced a National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan , which was received by the convention on 30 May 2002.

Slovenia is distinguished by an exceptionally wide variety of habitats, [ 98 ] due to the contact of geological units and biogeographical regions, and due to human influences. The country is home to four terrestrial ecoregions: Dinaric Mountains mixed forests , Pannonian mixed forests , Alps conifer and mixed forests , and Illyrian deciduous forests .

[ 99 ] Around 12.5% of the territory is protected with 35.5% in the Natura 2000 ecological network.

[ 100 ] Despite this, because of pollution and environmental degradation, diversity has been in decline. Slovenia had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 3.78/10, ranking it 140th globally out of 172 countries.

[ 101 ] Animals [ edit ] The biological diversity of the country is high, with 1% of the world's organisms on 0.004% of the Earth's surface area.

[ 102 ] There are 75 mammal species, among them marmots , Alpine ibex , and chamois . There are numerous deer , roe deer , boar , and hares .

[ 103 ] The edible dormouse is often found in the Slovenian beech forests. Trapping these animals is a long tradition and is part of Slovenian national identity.

[ 104 ] Some important carnivores include the Eurasian lynx , [ 105 ] [ 106 ] European wild cats , foxes (especially the red fox ), and European jackal .

[ 107 ] There are hedgehogs , martens , and snakes such as vipers and grass snakes . According to recent estimates, Slovenia has c. 40–60 wolves [ 108 ] and about 450 brown bears .

[ 109 ] [ 110 ] Slovenia is home to an exceptionally diverse number of cave species, with a few tens of endemic species .

[ 111 ] Among the cave vertebrates, the only known one is the olm , living in Karst, Lower Carniola, and White Carniola.

The only regular species of cetaceans found in the northern Adriatic sea is the bottlenose dolphin ( Tursiops truncatus ).

[ 112 ] There are a wide variety of birds, such as the tawny owl , the long-eared owl , the eagle owl , hawks , and short-toed eagles . Other birds of prey have been recorded, as well as a growing number of ravens, crows and magpies migrating into Ljubljana and Maribor where they thrive.

[ 113 ] Other birds include black and green woodpeckers and the white stork , which nests mainly in Prekmurje .

Modern Lipizzaner grazing There are 13 domestic animals native to Slovenia, [ 114 ] of eight species (hen, pig, dog, horse, sheep, goat, honey bee, and cattle).

[ 115 ] Among these are the Karst Shepherd , [ 116 ] the Carniolan honeybee , and the Lipizzan horse.

[ 115 ] The marble trout or marmorata ( Salmo marmoratus ) is an indigenous Slovenian fish.

[ 117 ] Extensive breeding programmes have been introduced to repopulate the marble trout into lakes and streams invaded by non-indigenous species of trout . Slovenia is also home to the wels catfish .

More than 2,400 fungal species have been recorded from Slovenia [ 118 ] and, since that figure does not include lichen-forming fungi, the total number of Slovenian fungi already known is undoubtedly much higher. Many more remain to be discovered.

Slovenia is the third most-forested country in Europe, [ 119 ] with 58.3% of the territory covered by forests.

[ 120 ] The forests are an important natural resource, and logging is kept to a minimum.

[ 121 ] In the interior of the country are typical Central European forests, predominantly oak and beech . In the mountains, spruce , fir , and pine are more common. Pine trees grow on the Karst Plateau , although only one-third of the region is covered by pine forest. The lime/linden tree, common in Slovenian forests, is a national symbol. The tree line is at 1,700 to 1,800 metres (5,600 to 5,900 feet).

[ 122 ] In the Alps, flowers such as Daphne blagayana , gentians ( Gentiana clusii , Gentiana froelichii ), Primula auricula , edelweiss (the symbol of Slovene mountaineering), Cypripedium calceolus , Fritillaria meleagris (snake's head fritillary), and Pulsatilla grandis are found.

Slovenia harbors many plants of ethnobotanically useful groups. Of 59 known species of ethnobotanical importance, some species such as Aconitum napellus , Cannabis sativa and Taxus baccata are restricted for use as per the Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia.

[ 123 ] Government and politics [ edit ] Main article: Politics of Slovenia See also: Foreign relations of Slovenia Nataša Pirc Musar President Robert Golob Prime Minister Slovenia is a parliamentary democracy republic with a multi-party system . The head of state is the president , who is elected by popular vote and has an important integrative role.

[ 124 ] The president is elected for five years and at maximum for two consecutive terms. The president has a representative role and is the commander-in-chief of the Slovenian armed forces .

[ 125 ] The executive and administrative authority in Slovenia is held by the Government of Slovenia ( Vlada Republike Slovenije ), [ 69 ] headed by the Prime Minister and the council of ministers or cabinet, who are elected by the National Assembly ( Državni zbor Republike Slovenije ). The legislative authority is held by the bicameral Parliament of Slovenia , characterised by an asymmetric duality.

[ clarification needed ] [ 126 ] The bulk of power is concentrated in the National Assembly, which consists of ninety members. Of those, 88 are elected by all the citizens in a system of proportional representation , whereas two are elected by the registered members of the autochthonous Hungarian and Italian minorities . Elections take place every four years. The National Council ( Državni svet Republike Slovenije ), consisting of forty members, appointed to represent social, economic, professional and local interest groups, has a limited advisory and control power.

[ 126 ] The 1992–2004 period was marked by the rule of the Liberal Democracy of Slovenia , which was responsible for gradual transition from the Titoist economy to the capitalist market economy. It later attracted much criticism by neo-liberal economists, who demanded a less gradual approach. The party's president Janez Drnovšek , who served as prime minister between 1992 and 2002, was one of the most influential Slovenian politicians of the 1990s, [ 127 ] alongside President Milan Kučan (who served between 1990 and 2002).

[ 128 ] [ 129 ] The 2005–2008 period was characterized by over-enthusiasm after joining the EU. During the first term of Janez Janša 's government, for the first time after independence, the Slovenian banks saw their loan-deposit ratios veering out of control. There was over-borrowing from foreign banks and then over-crediting of customers, including local business magnates . After the onset of the Great Recession and European sovereign-debt crisis , the left-wing coalition that replaced Janša's government in the 2008 elections, had to face the consequences of the 2005–2008 over-borrowing. Attempts to implement reforms that would help economic recovery were met by student protesters, led by a student who later became a member of Janez Janša 's SDS , and by the trade unions. The proposed reforms were postponed in a referendum. The left-wing government was ousted with a vote of no confidence.

In March 2020, Janez Janša became prime minister for third time in the new coalition government of SDS, the Modern Centre Party (SMC), New Slovenia (NSi) and Pensioners' Party (DeSUS).

[ 130 ] Janez Janša was known as a right-wing populist and a supporter of former US President Donald Trump and right-wing Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary.

[ 131 ] [ 132 ] In April 2022, liberal opposition, the Freedom Movement , won the parliamentary election . The Freedom Movement won 34.5% of the vote, compared with 23.6% for Janša's Slovenian Democratic party .

[ 133 ] On 25 May 2022, Slovenia's parliament voted to appoint the leader of Freedom Movement, Robert Golob , as the new Prime Minister of Slovenia .

[ 134 ] Judiciary [ edit ] Main articles: Judiciary of Slovenia and Law enforcement in Slovenia Judicial powers in Slovenia are executed by judges, who are elected by the National Assembly. Judicial power in Slovenia is implemented by courts with general responsibilities and specialised courts that deal with matters relating to specific legal areas. The State Prosecutor is an independent state authority responsible for prosecuting cases brought against those suspected of committing criminal offences. The Constitutional Court , composed of nine judges elected for nine-year terms, decides on the conformity of laws with the Constitution; all laws and regulations must also conform with the general principles of international law and with ratified international agreements.

[ 37 ] Military [ edit ] Main article: Military of Slovenia The Slovenian Armed Forces provide military defence independently or within an alliance, in accordance with international agreements. Since conscription was abolished in 2003, it is organized as a fully professional standing army .

[ 135 ] The Commander-in-Chief is the President of the Republic of Slovenia , while operational command is in the domain of the Chief of the General Staff of the Slovenian Armed Forces. In 2016, military spending was an estimated 0.91% of the country's GDP. Since joining NATO , the Slovenian Armed Forces have taken a more active part in supporting international peace. They have participated in peace support operations and humanitarian activities. Among others, Slovenian soldiers are part of the international forces serving in Bosnia and Herzegovina , Kosovo , and Afghanistan .

[ 136 ] According to the 2024 Global Peace Index , the country is the 9th most peaceful country in the world.

[ 137 ] Administrative divisions and traditional regions [ edit ] Main articles: Statistical regions of Slovenia and Municipalities of Slovenia (SAF), Slovenian KFOR contingent in Kosovo Municipalities [ edit ] Officially, Slovenia is subdivided into 212 municipalities (twelve of which have the status of urban municipalities). The municipalities are the only bodies of local autonomy in Slovenia. Each municipality is headed by a mayor ( župan ), elected every four years by popular vote, and a municipal council ( občinski svet ). In the majority of municipalities, the municipal council is elected through the system of proportional representation ; only a few smaller municipalities use the plurality voting system . In the urban municipalities, the municipal councils are called town (or city) councils.

[ 138 ] Every municipality also has a Head of the Municipal Administration ( načelnik občinske uprave ), appointed by the mayor, who is responsible for the functioning of the local administration.

[ 138 ] Administrative divisions [ edit ] There is no official intermediate unit between the municipalities and the Republic of Slovenia. The 62 administrative districts, officially called "Administrative Units" ( upravne enote ), are only subdivisions of the national government administration and are named after their respective bases of government offices.

[ 139 ] Traditional regions and identities [ edit ] Slovenia's traditional regions are based on the former Habsburg crown lands , which included Carniola , Carinthia , Styria , and the Littoral . Stronger than with either Carniola as a whole, or with Slovenia as a state, Slovenes tend to identify themselves with the traditional regions of the Slovene Littoral , Prekmurje , and traditional (sub)regions, such as Upper Carniola, Lower Carniola, and, to a lesser extent, Inner Carniola.

[ 140 ] The capital city Ljubljana was historically the administrative seat of Carniola and belonged to Inner Carniola , [ 141 ] except for the Šentvid district, which was in Upper Carniola and also where the border between German-annexed territory and the Italian Province of Ljubljana was during the Second World War .

[ 141 ] Statistical regions [ edit ] Statistical regions: 1. Gorizia, 2. Upper Carniola, 3. Carinthia, 4. Drava, 5. Mura, 6. Central Slovenia, 7. Central Sava, 8. Savinja, 9. Coastal–Karst, 10. Inner Carniola–Karst, 11. Southeast Slovenia, 12. Lower Sava The 12 statistical regions have no administrative function and are subdivided into two macroregions for the purpose of the Regional policy of the European Union .

[ 142 ] These two macroregions are: Eastern Slovenia ( Vzhodna Slovenija – SI01), which groups the Mura, Drava, Carinthia, Savinja, Central Sava, Lower Sava, Southeast Slovenia, and Inner Carniola–Karst statistical regions.

Western Slovenia ( Zahodna Slovenija – SI02), which groups the Central Slovenia, Upper Carniola, Gorizia, and Coastal–Karst statistical regions.

Economy [ edit ] Main article: Economy of Slovenia Slovenia has a developed economy and is the richest Slavic country by GDP per capita.

[ 143 ] Slovenia is also among the top global economies in terms of human capital .

[ 144 ] It is the most developed transition country with an old mining - industrial tradition, chemical industry , and developed service activities.
Slovenia was in the beginning of 2007 the first new member to introduce the euro as its currency, replacing the tolar . Since 2010, it has been member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development .

[ 145 ] [ 146 ] There is a big difference in prosperity between the various regions. The economically wealthiest regions are the Central Slovenia region, which includes the capital Ljubljana and the western Slovenian regions (the Gorizia and Coastal–Karst Statistical Regions), while the least wealthy regions are the Mura , Central Sava , and Littoral–Inner Carniola Statistical Regions.

[ 147 ] Economic growth [ edit ] This section needs additional citations for verification .

Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources in this section. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed.

( April 2023 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) GDP per capita development in Slovenia In 2004–06, the economy grew on average by nearly 5% a year in Slovenia; in 2007, it expanded by almost 7%. The growth surge was fuelled by debt, particularly among firms, and especially in construction. The Great Recession and European sovereign-debt crisis had a significant impact on the domestic economy.

[ 148 ] The construction industry was severely hit in 2010 and 2011.

[ 149 ] In 2009, Slovenian GDP per capita shrank by 8%, the biggest decline in the European Union after the Baltic countries and Finland. An increasing burden for the Slovenian economy has been its rapidly aging population.

[ 150 ] In August 2012, the year-on-year contraction was 0.8%; however, 0.2% growth was recorded in the first quarter (in relation to the quarter before, after data was adjusted according to season and working days).

[ 151 ] Year-on-year contraction has been attributed to the fall in domestic consumption and the slowdown in export growth. The decrease in domestic consumption has been attributed to the fiscal austerity , to the freeze on budget expenditure in the final months of 2011, [ 152 ] to the failure of the efforts to implement economic reforms , to inappropriate financing, and to the decrease in exports.

[ 153 ] Due to the effects of the crisis, it was expected that several banks had to be bailed out by EU funds in 2013; however, needed capital was able to be covered by the country's own funds. Fiscal actions and legislations aiming on the reduction of spendings as well as several privatisations supported an economic recovery as from 2014.

[ 154 ] The real economic growth rate was at 2.5% in 2016 and accelerated to 5% in 2017.

[ 155 ] The construction sector has seen a recent increase, [ 155 ] and the tourism industry is expected to have continuous rising numbers.

[ 156 ] Since 2017, Slovenia has experienced moderate economic growth, with GDP growth averaging around 2% per year between 2017 and 2019. However, like many other countries, Slovenia's economy has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, with a contraction of around 5% in 2020. Overall, Slovenia's economy is relatively small but open and has shown resilience in recent years.

Slovenia's manufacturing sector is one of the largest contributors to the country's economy, accounting for around 25% of GDP. The country has a strong tradition in manufacturing, particularly in the areas of automotive and electrical engineering. Other important sectors include services, which account for around 65% of GDP, and agriculture, forestry, and fishing, which account for around 2% of GDP.

Slovenia is a highly export-oriented economy, with exports accounting for around 80% of GDP. The country's main export partners are other European countries, particularly Germany, Italy, and Austria. Key exports include machinery and transport equipment, manufactured goods, and chemicals.

The government of Slovenia has implemented a range of policies aimed at promoting economic growth and development. These include efforts to attract foreign investment, reduce red tape, and increase investment in research and development. The country has also introduced reforms aimed at improving the efficiency of its labor market and increasing the flexibility of its economy. The government's approach to consulting business associations has been noted by the European Commission as a good practice example.

[ 157 ] Services and industry [ edit ] Almost two-thirds of people are employed in services, and over one-third in industry and construction.

[ 158 ] Slovenia benefits from a well-educated workforce, well-developed infrastructure, and its location at the crossroads of major trade routes.

[ 145 ] The level of foreign direct investment (FDI) per capita in Slovenia is one of the lowest in the EU, [ 145 ] and the labor productivity and the competitiveness of the Slovenian economy is still significantly below the EU average.

[ 159 ] [ 160 ] Taxes are relatively high, the labor market is seen by business interests as being inflexible, and industries are losing sales to China, India, and elsewhere.

[ 161 ] High level of openness makes Slovenia extremely sensitive to economic conditions in its main trading partners and changes in its international price competitiveness.

[ 162 ] The main industries are motor vehicles, electric and electronic equipment, machinery, pharmaceuticals , and fuels.

[ 145 ] Examples of major Slovenian companies operating in Slovenia include the home appliance manufacturer Gorenje , the pharmaceutical companies Krka and Lek ( Novartis ' subsidiary), the oil distributing company Petrol Group , energy distribution companys GEN, GEN-I, HSE and Revoz , a manufacturing subsidiary of Renault .

[ 163 ] [ 164 ] [ 165 ] Energy [ edit ] Further information: Energy in Slovenia Krško Nuclear Power Plant, 696 MW In 2018, the net energy production was 12,262 GWh and consumption was 14,501 GWh. Hydroelectric plants produced 4,421 GWh, thermal plants produced 4,049 GWh, and the Krško Nuclear Power Plant produced 2,742 GWh (50% share that goes to Slovenia; other 50% goes to Croatia due to joint ownership). 
Domestic electricity consumption was covered 84.6% by domestic production; the percentage is decreasing from year to year meaning Slovenia is more and more dependent on electricity imports.

[ 166 ] A new 600 MW block of Šoštanj thermal power plant finished construction and went online in the autumn of 2014.

[ 167 ] The new 39.5 MW HE Krško hydro power plant was finished in 2013.

[ 168 ] The 41.5 MW HE Brežice and 30.5 MW HE Mokrice hydro power plants were built on the Sava River in 2018 and the construction of ten more hydropower plants with a cumulative capacity of 338 MW is planned to be finished by 2030. A large pumped-storage hydro power plant Kozjak on the Drava River is in the planning stage.

At the end of 2018, at least 295 MWp of photovoltaic modules and 31,4 MW of biogas powerplants were installed. Compared to 2017, renewable energy sources contributed 5.6 percentage points more into whole energy consumption. There is interest to add more production in the area of solar and wind energy sources (subsidising schemes are increasing economic feasibility), but microlocation settlement procedures take enormous toll on the efficiency of this intitiatve (nature preservation vs. energy production facilities dilemma).

[ 166 ] Tourism [ edit ] Postojna Cave Main article: Tourism in Slovenia Slovenia offers tourists a wide variety of natural and cultural amenities. Different forms of tourism have developed. The tourist gravitational area is considerably large, however the tourist market is small. There has been no large-scale tourism and no acute environmental pressures; [ 169 ] in 2017, National Geographic Traveller's Magazine declared Slovenia as the country with the world's most sustainable tourism .

[ 170 ] The nation's capital, Ljubljana , has many important Baroque and Vienna Secession buildings, with several important works of the native born architect Jože Plečnik .

[ 171 ] At the northwestern corner of the country lie the Julian Alps with Lake Bled and the Soča Valley, as well as the nation's highest peak, Mount Triglav in the middle of Triglav National Park . Other mountain ranges include Kamnik–Savinja Alps , the Karawanks , and Pohorje , popular with skiers and hikers.

[ 172 ] The Karst Plateau in the Slovene Littoral gave its name to karst , a landscape shaped by water dissolving the carbonate bedrock, forming caves. The best-known caves are Postojna Cave and the UNESCO -listed Škocjan Caves . The region of Slovenian Istria meets the Adriatic Sea , where the most important historical monument is the Venetian Gothic Mediterranean town of Piran while the settlement of Portorož attracts crowds in summer.

[ 173 ] Lake Bled with its island The hills around Slovenia's second-largest city, Maribor , are renowned for their wine-making. The northeastern part of the country is rich with spas, [ 174 ] with Rogaška Slatina , Radenci , Čatež ob Savi , Dobrna , and Moravske Toplice growing in importance in the last two decades.

[ 175 ] Other popular tourist destinations include the historic cities of Ptuj and Škofja Loka , and several castles, such as Predjama Castle .

[ 176 ] [ 177 ] Important parts of tourism in Slovenia include congress and gambling tourism . Slovenia is the country with the highest percentage of casinos per 1,000 inhabitants in the European Union.

[ 178 ] Perla in Nova Gorica is the largest casino in the region.

[ 179 ] Most of foreign tourists to Slovenia come from the key European markets: Italy , Austria , Germany , Croatia , Belgium , Netherlands , Serbia , Russia and Ukraine , followed by United Kingdom and Ireland .

[ 180 ] European tourists create more than 90% of Slovenia's tourist income. In 2016, Slovenia was declared the world's first green country by the Netherlands-based organization Green Destinations.

[ 181 ] On being declared the most sustainable country in 2016, Slovenia had a big part to play at the ITB Berlin to promote sustainable tourism.

Transport [ edit ] Main article: Transport in Slovenia Geography has dictated transport routes in Slovenia. Significant mountain ranges, major rivers and proximity to the Danube played roles in the development of the area's transportation corridors. One recent particular advantage are the Pan-European transport corridors V (the fastest link between the North Adriatic, and Central and Eastern Europe) and X (linking Central Europe with the Balkans). This gives it a special position in the European social, economic and cultural integration and restructuring.

[ 182 ] Motorways in Slovenia in August 2020 Roads [ edit ] The road freight and passenger transport constitutes the largest part of transport in Slovenia at 80%.

[ 183 ] Personal cars are much more popular than public road passenger transport, which has significantly declined.

[ 183 ] [ 184 ] Slovenia has a very high highway and motorway density compared to the European Union average.

[ 185 ] The highway system, the construction of which was accelerated after 1994, [ 186 ] has slowly but steadily transformed Slovenia into a large conurbation .

[ 187 ] Other state roads have been rapidly deteriorating because of neglect and the overall increase in traffic.

[ 185 ] Railways [ edit ] Main article: Slovenian Railways The existing Slovenian railways are out-of-date and have difficulty competing with the motorway network; partially also as a result of dispersed population settlement.

[ 188 ] Due to this fact and the projected increase in traffic through the port of Koper , which is primarily by train, a second rail on the Koper-Divača route is in early stages of starting construction.

[ 189 ] With a lack of financial assets, maintenance and modernisation of the Slovenian railway network have been neglected.

[ 190 ] Due to the out-of-date infrastructure, the share of the railway freight transport has been in decline in Slovenia.

[ 191 ] The railway passenger transport has been recovering after a large drop in the 1990s.

[ 191 ] The Pan-European railway corridors V and X, and several other major European rail lines intersect in Slovenia.

[ 190 ] Ports [ edit ] The major Slovenian port is the Port of Koper . It is the largest Northern Adriatic port in terms of container transport, [ 192 ] with almost 590,000 TEUs annually [ 193 ] and lines to all major world ports.

[ 194 ] [ 195 ] It is much closer to destinations east of the Suez than the ports of Northern Europe.

[ 194 ] In addition, the maritime passenger traffic mostly takes place in Koper.

[ 196 ] Two smaller ports used for the international passenger transport as well as cargo transport are located in Izola and Piran . Passenger transport mainly takes place with Italy and Croatia.

[ 197 ] Splošna plovba , [ 198 ] the only Slovenian shipping company, transports freight and is active only in foreign ports.

[ 196 ] Air [ edit ] Air transport in Slovenia is very low, [ 191 ] but has significantly grown since 1991.

[ 199 ] Of the three international airports in Slovenia, Ljubljana Jože Pučnik Airport in central Slovenia is the busiest, [ 199 ] with connections to many major European destinations.

[ 200 ] The Maribor Edvard Rusjan Airport is located in the eastern part of the country and the Portorož Airport in the west.

[ 199 ] The state-owned Adria Airways was the largest Slovenian airline; however in 2019 it declared bankruptcy and ceased operations.

[ 199 ] Since 2003, several new carriers have entered the market, mainly low-cost airlines.

[ 185 ] The only Slovenian military airport is the Cerklje ob Krki Air Base in the southwest.

[ 201 ] There are also 12 public airports in Slovenia.

[ 199 ] Demographics [ edit ] Main article: Demographics of Slovenia Population density in Slovenia by municipality . The four main urban areas are visible: Ljubljana and Kranj (centre), Maribor (northeast) and the Slovene Istria (southwest) The population of Slovenia as of January 2025 is 2,130,850.

[ 202 ] With 105 inhabitants per square kilometer (272/sq mi), Slovenia ranks low among the European countries in population density (compared to 402/km 2 (1,040/sq mi) for the Netherlands or 195/km 2 (510/sq mi) for Italy). The Inner Carniola–Karst Statistical Region has the lowest population density while the Central Slovenia Statistical Region has the highest.

[ 203 ] Slovenia is among the European countries with the most pronounced ageing of its population, ascribable to a low birth rate and increasing life expectancy.

[ 204 ] Almost all Slovenian inhabitants older than 64 are retired, with no significant difference between the genders.

[ 205 ] The working-age group is diminishing in spite of immigration.

[ 206 ] The proposal to raise the retirement age from the current 57 for women and 58 for men was rejected in a referendum in 2011 .

[ 150 ] In addition, the difference among the genders regarding life expectancy is still significant.

[ 205 ] The total fertility rate (TFR) in 2024 was estimated at 1.6 children born/woman, which is lower than the replacement rate of 2.1.

[ 207 ] The majority of children are born to unmarried women (in 2023, 56.5% of all births were outside of marriage).

[ 208 ] In 2023, life expectancy at birth was 82 years (79.1 years male, and 85 years female).

[ 209 ] In 2020, the suicide rate in Slovenia was 17 per 100,000 persons per year, which places Slovenia among the highest ranked European countries.

[ 213 ] According to OECD definition of rural areas none of the Slovene statistical regions is mostly urbanised, meaning that 15% or less of the population lives in rural communities. According to this definition statistical regions are classified: mostly rural regions: Mura , Drava , Carinthia , Savinja , Lower Sava , Littoral–Inner Carniola , Gorizia , Southeast Slovenia moderately rural regions: Central Sava , Upper Carniola , Coastal–Karst , Central Slovenia .

[ 214 ] The only large town is the capital, Ljubljana. Other (medium-sized) towns include Maribor, Celje, and Kranj.

In 2002, Slovene was the native language of around 88% of Slovenia's population according to the census, with more than 92% of the Slovenian population speaking it in their home environment.

[ 217 ] [ 218 ] This statistic ranks Slovenia among the most homogeneous countries in the EU in terms of the share of speakers of the predominant mother tongue.

[ 219 ] Slovene is a highly diverse Slavic language in terms of dialects , [ 220 ] with different degrees of mutual intelligibility. Accounts of the number of dialects range from as few as seven [ 221 ] [ 222 ] [ 223 ] dialects, often considered dialect groups or dialect bases that are further subdivided into as many as 50 dialects.

[ 224 ] Other sources characterize the number of dialects as nine [ 225 ] or as eight.

[ 218 ] Gottscheerish or Granish , the traditional German dialect of Gottschee County, faces extinction.

[ 229 ] A significant number of people in Slovenia speak a variant of Serbo-Croatian ( Serbian , Croatian , Bosnian , or Montenegrin ) as their native language.

[ 233 ] About 86% of the foreign-born population originated from other countries of former Yugoslavia as (in descending order) Bosnia-Herzegovina , followed by immigrants from Croatia , Serbia , Kosovo , and North Macedonia .

[ 233 ] By the beginning of 2017, there were about 114,438 people with foreign citizenship residing in the country making up 5.5% of the total population. Of these foreigners, 76% had citizenships of the other countries from former Yugoslavia (excluding Croatia). Additionally 16.4% had EU-citizenships and 7.6% had citizenships of other countries.

[ 233 ] Ethnic composition of Slovenia (according to the 2002 census) [ 234 ] Slovene 83.06% Serb 1.98% Croat 1.81% Bosniak 1.10% Other minorities 4.85% Undeclared or unknown 8.9% According to the 2002 census, Slovenia's main ethnic group are Slovenes (83%); however, their share in the total population is continuously decreasing, due to their relatively low fertility rate . At least 13% (2002) of the population were immigrants from other parts of Former Yugoslavia and their descendants.

[ 235 ] They have settled mainly in cities and suburbanised areas.

[ 236 ] Relatively small but protected by the Constitution of Slovenia are the Hungarian and the Italian ethnic minority .

[ 237 ] [ 238 ] [ 239 ] A special position is held by the autochthonous and geographically dispersed Roma ethnic community .

[ 240 ] [ 241 ] The number of people immigrating into Slovenia rose steadily from 1995 [ 242 ] and has been increasing even more rapidly in recent years. After Slovenia joined the EU in 2004, the annual number of immigrants doubled by 2006 and increased by half yet again by 2009.

[ 218 ] After 1945, the country underwent a process of gradual but steady secularization . After a decade of persecution of religions, the Communist regime adopted a policy of relative tolerance towards churches. After 1990, the Catholic Church regained some of its former influence, but Slovenia remains a largely secularized society.

The 2018 Eurobarometer data shows 73.4% of population identifying as Catholic.

[ 1 ] This fell to 72.1% in the 2019 Eurobarometer survey.

[ 244 ] According to the Catholic Church data, the Catholic population fell from 78.04% in 2009 to 72.11% in 2019.

Primož Trubar , a theologian in the Lutheran tradition, was one of the most influential Protestant Reformers in Slovenia. Protestantism was extinguished in the Counter-Reformation implemented by the Habsburg dynasty , which controlled the region. It only survived in the easternmost regions due to protection of Hungarian nobles, who often happened to be Calvinist themselves. Today, a significant Lutheran minority lives in the easternmost region of Prekmurje , where they represent around a fifth of the population and are headed by a bishop with the seat in Murska Sobota .

[ 247 ] The third largest denomination, with around 2.2% of the population, is the Eastern Orthodox Church , with most adherents belonging to the Serbian Orthodox Church while a minority belongs to the Macedonian and other Eastern Orthodox churches.
