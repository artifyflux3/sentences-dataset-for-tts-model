Alma mater California Institute of Technology University of California, San Diego Known for Virtually Haken conjecture Freedman–He–Wang conjecture Wise's conjecture Marden tameness conjecture Awards Breakthrough Prize in Mathematics (2016) [ 1 ] Veblen Prize in Geometry (2013) Senior Berwick Prize (2012) Clay Research Award (2009) Scientific career Fields Mathematics Institutions University of California, Berkeley Doctoral advisor Michael Freedman Doctoral students Sebastián Hurtado-Salazar Ian Agol ( / ˈ eɪ ˌ ɡ ʊ l / ; born May 13, 1970) is an American mathematician who deals primarily with the topology of three-dimensional manifolds .

[ 2 ] Education and career [ edit ] Agol graduated with B.S. in mathematics from the California Institute of Technology in 1992 and obtained his Ph.D. in 1998 from the University of California, San Diego .  At UCSD, his advisor was Michael Freedman and his thesis was Topology of Hyperbolic 3-Manifolds .

[ 3 ] He is a professor at the University of California, Berkeley [ 4 ] and a former professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago .

[ 5 ] Contributions [ edit ] In 2004, Agol proved the Marden tameness conjecture , a conjecture of Albert Marden .

[ 6 ] It states that a hyperbolic 3-manifold with finitely generated fundamental group is homeomorphic to the interior of a compact 3-manifold. The conjecture was also independently proven by Danny Calegari and David Gabai , and implies the Ahlfors measure conjecture .

[ 6 ] In 2012, he announced a proof of the virtually Haken conjecture , which was published a year later.

[ 7 ] The conjecture (now theorem) states that every aspherical 3-manifold is finitely covered by a Haken manifold .

In 2022, he posted on the ArXiv a proof of Cameron Gordon 's 1981 conjecture on knot theory saying that ribbon concordance forms a partial ordering on the set of knots.

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] Awards and honors [ edit ] Agol, Calegari, and Gabai received the 2009 Clay Research Award for their proof of the Marden tameness conjecture.

[ 6 ] In 2005, Agol was a Guggenheim Fellow .

[ 10 ] In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society .

[ 11 ] In 2013, Agol was awarded the Oswald Veblen Prize in Geometry , along with Daniel Wise .

[ 12 ] In 2015, he was awarded the 2016 Breakthrough Prize in Mathematics , "for spectacular contributions to low dimensional topology and geometric group theory , including work on the solutions of the tameness , virtually Haken and virtual fibering conjectures." [ 13 ] In 2016, he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences .

[ 14 ] [ 15 ] Personal [ edit ] His identical twin brother, Eric Agol , [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] is an astronomy professor at the University of Washington in Seattle .
