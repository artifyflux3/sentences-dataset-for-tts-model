A planet is a large, rounded astronomical body that is neither a star nor its remnant. The best available theory of planet formation is the nebular hypothesis, which posits that an interstellar cloud collapses out of a nebula to create a young protostar orbited by a protoplanetary disk. There are eight planets within the Solar System ; planets outside of the solar system are also known as exoplanets .

Artist's concept of the potentially habitable exoplanet Kepler-186f As of 14 August 2025, there are 5,983 confirmed exoplanets in 4,470 planetary systems , with 1,001 systems having more than one planet .

[ 1 ] Most of these were discovered by the Kepler space telescope . There are an additional 1,979 potential exoplanets from Kepler's first mission yet to be confirmed, as well as 976 from its " Second Light " mission and 4,687 from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission.
