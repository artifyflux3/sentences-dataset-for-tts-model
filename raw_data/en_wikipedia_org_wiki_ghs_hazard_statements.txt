They are intended to form a set of standardized phrases about the hazards of chemical substances and mixtures that can be translated into different languages.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] As such, they serve the same purpose as the well-known R-phrases , which they are intended to replace.

Hazard statements are one of the key elements for the labelling of containers under the GHS, along with: [ 3 ] an identification of the product one or more hazard pictograms ( where necessary ) a signal word – either Danger or Warning – where necessary precautionary statements , indicating how the product should be handled to minimize risks to the user (as well as to other people and the general environment) the identity of the supplier (who might be a manufacturer or importer).

Each hazard statement is designated a code, starting with the letter H and followed by three digits. Statements which correspond to related hazards are grouped together by code number, so the numbering is not consecutive. The code is used for reference purposes, for example to help with translations, but it is the actual phrase which should appear on labels and safety data sheets .

Nevertheless, the older system based on the Dangerous Substances Directive was used in parallel until June 2015. Some R-phrases which do not have simple equivalents under the GHS have been retained under the CLP Regulation: [ 6 ] the numbering mirrors the number of the previous R-phrase.

Physical properties [ edit ] EUH006: Explosive with or without contact with air, deleted in the fourth adaptation to technical progress of CLP.

EUH014: Reacts violently with water EUH018: In use may form flammable/explosive vapour-air mixture EUH019: May form explosive peroxides EUH044: Risk of explosion if heated under confinement Health properties [ edit ] EUH029: Contact with water liberates toxic gas EUH031: Contact with acids liberates toxic gas EUH032: Contact with acids liberates very toxic gas EUH066: Repeated exposure may cause skin dryness or cracking EUH070: Toxic by eye contact EUH071: Corrosive to the respiratory tract EUH380: May cause endocrine disruption in humans EUH381: Suspected of causing endocrine disruption in humans Environmental properties [ edit ] EUH059: Hazardous to the ozone layer, superseded by GHS Class 5.1 in the second adaptation to technical progress of CLP.

EUH430: May cause endocrine disruption in the environment EUH431: Suspected of causing endocrine disruption in the environment EUH440: Accumulates in the environment and living organisms including in humans EUH441: Strongly accumulates in the environment and living organisms including in humans EUH450: Can cause long-lasting and diffuse contamination of water resources EUH451: Can cause very long-lasting and diffuse contamination of water resources Other EU hazard statements [ edit ] Some other hazard statements intended for use in very specific circumstances have also been retained under the CLP Regulation.

[ 7 ] In this case, the numbering of the EU specific hazard statements can coincide with GHS hazard statements if the "EU" prefix is not included.

EUH201: Contains lead. Should not be used on surfaces liable to be chewed or sucked by children.

EUH201A: Warning! Contains lead.

EUH202: Cyanoacrylate. Danger. Bonds skin and eyes in seconds. Keep out of the reach of children.

Australia [ edit ] The GHS was adopted in Australia from 1 January 2012 and becomes mandatory in States and Territories that have adopted the harmonised Work Health and Safety laws (other than Victoria and Western Australia) as of 1 January 2017.

[ 8 ] The National Code of Practice for the Preparation of Safety Data Sheets for Hazardous Chemicals [ 9 ] includes 12 Australian-specific GHS Hazard Statements, as follows: Physical hazard statements [ edit ] AUH001: Explosive without moisture AUH006: Explosive with or without contact with air AUH014: Reacts violently with water AUH018: In use, may form a flammable/explosive vapor-air mixture AUH019: May form explosive peroxides AUH044: Risk of explosion if heated under confinement Human health hazard statements [ edit ] AUH029: Contact with water liberates toxic gas AUH031: Contact with acids liberates toxic gas Additional non-GHS hazard statements [ edit ] AUH032: Contact with acids liberates very toxic gas AUH066: Repeated exposure may cause skin dryness or cracking AUH070: Toxic by eye contact AUH071: Corrosive to the respiratory tract New Zealand [ edit ] As of March 2009, the relevant New Zealand regulations under the Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act 1996 do not specify the exact wording required for hazard statements. However, the New Zealand classification system includes three categories of environmental hazard which are not included in the GHS Rev.2: Ecotoxicity to soil environment Ecotoxicity to terrestrial vertebrates Ecotoxicity to terrestrial invertebrates These are classes 9.2–9.4 respectively of the New Zealand classification scheme, and are divided into subclasses according to the degree of hazard.

[ 10 ] Substances in subclass 9.2D ("Substances that are slightly harmful in the soil environment") do not require a hazard statement, while substances in the other subclasses require an indication of the general degree of hazard and general type of hazard.

[ 11 ] Notes [ edit ] ^ The United Nations has published the list of GHS hazard statements in all UN official languages (Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, Spanish): it can be found in Annex 3 of GHS Rev.2 for the corresponding language.
