A **day** is the [time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time "Time")[period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_period "Rotation period") of a full [rotation of the Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_rotation "Earth's rotation") with respect to the [Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun "Sun"). On average, this is 24 [hours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour "Hour") (86,400 [seconds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second "Second")). As a day passes at a given location it experiences [morning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morning "Morning"), [afternoon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afternoon "Afternoon"), [evening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evening "Evening"), and [night](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night "Night"). This daily cycle drives [circadian rhythms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circadian_rhythm "Circadian rhythm") in many organisms, which are vital to many [life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life "Life") processes.

A collection of sequential days is organized into [calendars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar "Calendar") as [dates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar_date "Calendar date"), almost always into [weeks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Week "Week"), [months](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Month "Month") and [years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year "Year"). A [solar calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_calendar "Solar calendar") organizes dates based on the Sun's annual cycle, giving consistent start dates for the [four seasons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season "Season") from year to year. A [lunar calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_calendar "Lunar calendar") organizes dates based on the [Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon "Moon")'s [lunar phase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_phase "Lunar phase").

In common usage, a day starts at [midnight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnight "Midnight"), written as 00:00 or [12:00 am](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_am "12 am") in [24-](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-hour_clock "24-hour clock") or [12-hour clocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12-hour_clock "12-hour clock"), respectively. Because the time of midnight varies between locations, [time zones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_zone "Time zone") are set up to facilitate the use of a uniform [standard time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_time "Standard time"). Other conventions are sometimes used, for example the [Jewish religious calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_calendar "Hebrew calendar") counts days from sunset to sunset, so the [Jewish Sabbath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabbath#Judaism "Sabbath") begins at sundown on [Friday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friday "Friday"). In [astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy "Astronomy"), a day begins at [noon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noon "Noon") so that observations throughout a single night are recorded as happening on the same day.

In specific applications, the definition of a day is slightly modified, such as in the [SI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units "International System of Units") day (exactly 86,400 [seconds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second "Second")) used for [computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer "Computer") and [standards keeping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_metrology "Time metrology"), [local mean time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_mean_time "Local mean time") accounting of the [Earth's natural fluctuation of a solar day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_length_fluctuations "Day length fluctuations"), and [stellar day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_day "Stellar day") and [sidereal day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidereal_time "Sidereal time") (using the [celestial sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_sphere "Celestial sphere")) used for [astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy "Astronomy"). In some countries outside of the [tropics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropics "Tropics"), [daylight saving time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time "Daylight saving time") is practiced, and each year there will be one 23-hour civil day and one 25-hour civil day. Due to slight variations in the rotation of the Earth, there are rare times when a [leap second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second "Leap second") will get inserted at the end of a [UTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time "Coordinated Universal Time") day, and so while almost all days have a duration of 86,400 seconds, there are these exceptional cases of a day with 86,401 seconds (in the half-century spanning 1972 through 2022, there have been a total of 27 leap seconds that have been inserted, so roughly once every other year). It is a [non-SI unit that is accepted for use with SI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-SI_units_mentioned_in_the_SI "Non-SI units mentioned in the SI").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day#cite_note-1)

Etymology
---------

The term comes from the [Old English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English "Old English") term _dæġ_ (/dæj/), with its cognates such as _dagur_ in [Icelandic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icelandic_language "Icelandic language"), _Tag_ in [German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language "German language"), and _dag_ in [Norwegian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_language "Norwegian language"), [Danish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danish_language "Danish language"), [Swedish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_language "Swedish language") and [Dutch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_language "Dutch language") – all stemming from a [Proto-Germanic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Germanic "Proto-Germanic") root _*dagaz_.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day#cite_note-:0-2)

### Apparent and mean solar day

[![Image 4](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/EpicEarth-Globespin-tilt-23.4.gif/250px-EpicEarth-Globespin-tilt-23.4.gif)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:EpicEarth-Globespin-tilt-23.4.gif)

Earth's rotation imaged by [Deep Space Climate Observatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Space_Climate_Observatory "Deep Space Climate Observatory"), showing axis tilt

Several definitions of this universal human concept are used according to context, need, and convenience. Besides the day of 24 hours (86,400 seconds), the word _day_ is used for several different spans of time based on the rotation of the Earth around its axis. An important one is the _solar day_, the time it takes for the Sun to return to its culmination point (its highest point in the sky). Due to an orbit's eccentricity, the Sun resides in one of the orbit's [foci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_(geometry) "Focus (geometry)") instead of the middle. Consequently, due to [Kepler's second law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_laws_of_planetary_motion#Second_law "Kepler's laws of planetary motion"), the planet travels at different speeds at various positions in its orbit, and thus a solar day is not the same length of time throughout the orbital year. Because the Earth moves along an [eccentric orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-major_and_semi-minor_axes#Semi-major_and_semi-minor_axes_of_the_planets "Semi-major and semi-minor axes") around the Sun while the Earth spins on an inclined axis, this period can be up to 7.9 seconds more than (or less than) 24 hours. In recent decades, the average length of a solar day on Earth has been about 86,400.002 seconds[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day#cite_note-3) (24.000 000 6 hours). There are currently about 365.2421875 solar days in one mean [tropical year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_year "Tropical year").

Ancient custom has a new day starting at either the rising or setting of the Sun on the local horizon (Italian reckoning, for example, being 24 hours from sunset, old style).[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day#cite_note-4) The exact moment of, and the interval between, two sunrises or sunsets depends on the geographical position ([longitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude "Longitude") and latitude, as well as altitude), and the time of [year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year "Year") (as indicated by ancient hemispherical [sundials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundial "Sundial")).

A more constant day can be defined by the Sun passing through the local [meridian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meridian_(geography) "Meridian (geography)"), which happens at local [noon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noon "Noon") (upper [culmination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culmination "Culmination")) or [midnight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnight "Midnight") (lower culmination). The exact moment is dependent on the geographical longitude, and to a lesser extent on the time of the year. The length of such a day is nearly constant (24 hours ± 30 seconds). This is the time as indicated by modern sundials.

A further improvement defines a fictitious mean Sun that moves with constant speed along the [celestial equator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_equator "Celestial equator"); the speed is the same as the average speed of the real Sun, but this removes the variation over a year as the Earth moves along its orbit around the Sun (due to both its velocity and its axial tilt).

In terms of Earth's rotation, the average day length is about 360.9856°. A day lasts for more than 360° of rotation because of the Earth's revolution around the Sun. With a full year being slightly more than 360 days, the Earth's daily orbit around the Sun is slightly less than 1°, so the day is slightly less than 361° of rotation.

Elsewhere in the [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System "Solar System") or other parts of the [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe "Universe"), a day is a full rotation of other large [astronomical objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_object "Astronomical object") with respect to its star.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day#cite_note-5)

#### Civil day

For civil purposes, a common clock time is typically defined for an entire region based on the local mean solar time at a central meridian. Such [_time zones_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_zone "Time zone") began to be adopted about the middle of the 19th century when [railroads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_transport "Rail transport") with regularly occurring schedules came into use, with most major countries having adopted them by 1929. As of 2015, throughout the world, 40 such zones are now in use: the central zone, from which all others are defined as offsets, is known as [UTC+00](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTC%2B00:00 "UTC+00:00"), which uses [Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time "Coordinated Universal Time").

The most common convention starts the civil day at [midnight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnight "Midnight"): this is near the time of the [lower culmination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culmination "Culmination") of the Sun on the central meridian of the time zone. Such a day may be called a [calendar day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar_day "Calendar day").

A day is commonly divided into 24 hours, with each hour being made up of 60 minutes, and each minute composed of 60 seconds.

### Sidereal day

[![Image 5](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/PIA19547-Ceres-DwarfPlanet-Dawn-RC3-Animation-20150504.gif/250px-PIA19547-Ceres-DwarfPlanet-Dawn-RC3-Animation-20150504.gif)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:PIA19547-Ceres-DwarfPlanet-Dawn-RC3-Animation-20150504.gif)

Rotation of the dwarf planet [Ceres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceres_(dwarf_planet) "Ceres (dwarf planet)")

A [sidereal day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidereal_time "Sidereal time") or [stellar day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_day "Stellar day") is the span of time it takes for the Earth to make one entire [rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation "Rotation")[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day#cite_note-6) with respect to the celestial background or a distant star (assumed to be fixed).[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day#cite_note-:1-7) Measuring a day as such is used in [astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy "Astronomy").[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day#cite_note-:1-7) A sidereal day is about 4 minutes less than a solar day of 24 hours (23 hours 56 minutes and 4.09 seconds), or 0.99726968 of a solar day of 24 hours.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day#cite_note-Allen296-8) There are about 366.2422 stellar days in one mean tropical year (one stellar day more than the number of solar days).[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day#cite_note-9)

Besides a stellar day on [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth"), other bodies in the Solar System have day times, the durations of these being:[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day#cite_note-10)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day#cite_note-VRG-20190118-11)

### In the International System of Units

In the [International System of Units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units "International System of Units") (SI), a day [not an official unit, but is accepted for use with SI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-SI_units_mentioned_in_the_SI "Non-SI units mentioned in the SI").[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day#cite_note-Non-SI-14) A day, with symbol d, is defined using SI units as 86,400 seconds; the second is the base unit of time in [SI units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI_units "SI units"). In 1967–68, during the 13th CGPM (Resolution 1),[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day#cite_note-15) the [International Bureau of Weights and Measures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Bureau_of_Weights_and_Measures "International Bureau of Weights and Measures") (BIPM) redefined a second as "the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the [radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay "Radioactive decay") corresponding to the transition between two [hyperfine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperfine_structure "Hyperfine structure")[levels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_level "Energy level") of the [ground state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stationary_state "Stationary state") of the [caesium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesium "Caesium")-133 [atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom "Atom")".[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day#cite_note-16) This makes the SI-based day last exactly 794,243,384,928,000 of those periods.

### In decimal and metric time

[![Image 6](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Decimal_Clock_face_by_Pierre_Daniel_Destigny_1798-1805.jpg/250px-Decimal_Clock_face_by_Pierre_Daniel_Destigny_1798-1805.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Decimal_Clock_face_by_Pierre_Daniel_Destigny_1798-1805.jpg)

Decimal clock face, made in around the start of the 19th century

Various [decimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_time "Decimal time") or [metric time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_time "Metric time") proposals have been made, but do not redefine the day, and use the day or [sidereal day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidereal_day "Sidereal day") as a base unit. Metric time uses metric prefixes to keep time. It uses the day as the base unit, and smaller units being fractions of a day: a metric hour (_deci_) is 1⁄10 of a day; a metric minute (_milli_) is 1⁄1000 of a day; etc.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day#cite_note-17) Similarly, in decimal time, the length of a day is static to normal time. A day is also split into 10 hours, and 10 days comprise a _décade –_ the equivalent of a week. 3 _décades_ make a month.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day#cite_note-:5-18): 35  Various decimal time proposals which do not redefine the day: Henri de Sarrauton's proposal kept days, and subdivided hours into 100 minutes;[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day#cite_note-:5-18): 42  in Mendizábal y Tamborel's proposal, the [sidereal day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidereal_day "Sidereal day") was the basic unit, with subdivisions made upon it;[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day#cite_note-:5-18): 42–43  and Rey-Pailhade's proposal divided the day 100 _cés.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day#cite\_note-:5-18): 42_

### Other definitions

The word refers to various similarly defined ideas, such as:

Full day
*   A full dark and light period, sometimes called a _[nychthemeron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nychthemeron "Nychthemeron")_ in English, from the Greek for _[night](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night "Night")-day_,[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day#cite_note-19) or more colloquially the term _24 hours_. Other languages may also have a separate word for a full day.
*   A day counting approximation, for example "See you in three days." or "the following day"
*   Part of a date: the day of the year (_doy_) in [ordinal dates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_date "Ordinal date"), day of the month (_dom_) in [calendar dates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar_date "Calendar date") or [day of the week](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weekday "Weekday") (_dow_) in [week dates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Week_date "Week date").
*   Time regularly spend at paid work on a single [work day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_day "Work day"), cf. [man-day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-hour "Man-hour") and [workweek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workweek "Workweek").

Daytime
*   The period of light when the Sun is above the local [horizon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon "Horizon") (that is, the time period from [sunrise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrise "Sunrise") to [sunset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunset "Sunset"))
*   The time period from 06:00–18:00 (6:00 [am](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12-hour_clock "12-hour clock") – 6:00 pm) or 21:00 (9:00 pm) or another fixed clock period overlapping or offset from other time periods such as "[morning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morning "Morning")", "[afternoon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afternoon "Afternoon")", or "[evening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evening "Evening")".
*   The time period from first-light "[dawn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawn "Dawn")" to last-light "[dusk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dusk "Dusk")".

Other
*   A specific period of the day, which may vary by context, such as "the school day" or "the work day".

Variations in length
--------------------

Mainly due to [tidal deceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_acceleration "Tidal acceleration") – the Moon's [gravitational pull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity "Gravity") slowing down the [Earth's rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_rotation "Earth's rotation") – the Earth's [rotational period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_period "Rotation period") is slowing.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day#cite_note-:4-20) Because of the way the second is defined, the mean length of a solar day is now about 86,400.002 seconds, and is increasing by about 2 [milliseconds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millisecond "Millisecond") per century.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day#cite_note-:2-21)

Since the rotation rate of the Earth is slowing, the length of a SI second fell out of sync with a second derived from the rotational period.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day#cite_note-:4-20) This created the need for [leap seconds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second "Leap second"), which insert extra seconds into [Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time "Coordinated Universal Time").[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day#cite_note-:4-20) Although typically 86,400 SI seconds in duration, a civil day can be either 86,401 or 86,399 SI seconds long on such a day. Other than the two-millisecond variation from tidal deceleration, [other factors minutely affect the day's length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_length_fluctuations "Day length fluctuations"), which creates an irregularity in the placement of leap seconds.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day#cite_note-22) Leap seconds are announced in advance by the [International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Earth_Rotation_and_Reference_Systems_Service "International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service"), which measures the Earth's rotation and determines whether a leap second is necessary.

### Geological day lengths

Discovered by paleontologist [John W. Wells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_W._Wells "John W. Wells"), the day lengths of geological periods have been estimated by measuring sedimentation rings in coral [fossils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil "Fossil"),[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day#cite_note-:3-23)[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day#cite_note-:2-21) due to some biological systems being affected by the tide.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day#cite_note-:2-21) The length of a day at the Earth's formation is estimated at 6 hours.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day#cite_note-:2-21) Arbab I. Arbab plotted day lengths over time and found a curved line.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day#cite_note-:2-21) Arbab attributed this to the change of water volume present affecting Earth's rotation.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day#cite_note-:2-21)

[Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun "Sun") and [Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon "Moon"), [Hartmann Schedel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartmann_Schedel "Hartmann Schedel")'s _[Nuremberg Chronicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg\_Chronicle "Nuremberg Chronicle")_, 1493

For most [diurnal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diurnality "Diurnality") animals, the day naturally begins at dawn and ends at sunset. Humans, with their cultural norms and scientific knowledge, have employed several different conceptions of the day's boundaries.

In the [Hebrew Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_Bible "Hebrew Bible"), [Genesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Genesis "Book of Genesis") 1:5 defines a day in terms of "evening" and "morning" before recounting the creation of the Sun to illuminate it: "And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day." The [Jewish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaism "Judaism") day begins at either sunset or nightfall (when three second-[magnitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnitude_(astronomy) "Magnitude (astronomy)") stars appear). [Medieval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages "Middle Ages") Europe also followed this tradition, known as [Florentine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florentine_calendar "Florentine calendar") reckoning: In this system, a reference like "two hours into the day" meant _two hours after sunset_ and thus times during the evening need to be shifted back one calendar day in modern reckoning. Days such as [Christmas Eve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Eve "Christmas Eve"), [Halloween](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween "Halloween") (“All Hallows’ Eve”), and the Eve of [Saint Agnes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnes_of_Rome "Agnes of Rome") are remnants of the older pattern when [holidays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holiday#Religious_holidays "Holiday") began during the prior evening.

The common convention among the [ancient Romans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome "Ancient Rome"),[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day#cite_note-24)[ancient Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China "Ancient China")[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day#cite_note-25) and in modern times is for the civil day to begin at midnight, i.e. 00:00, and to last a full 24 hours until 24:00, i.e. 00:00 of the next day. The [International Meridian Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Meridian_Conference "International Meridian Conference") of 1884 resolved

> That the Conference expresses the hope that as soon as may be practicable the astronomical and nautical days will be arranged everywhere to begin at midnight.

In [ancient Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt "Ancient Egypt") the day was reckoned from sunrise to sunrise.

Prior to 1926, Turkey had two time systems: _Turkish_, counting the hours from sunset, and _French_, counting the hours from midnight.

Parts
-----

Humans have divided the day in rough periods, which can have cultural implications, and other effects on humans' biological processes. The parts of the day do not have set times; they can vary by lifestyle or hours of daylight in a given place.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day#cite_note-26)

### Daytime

[Daytime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daytime "Daytime") is the part of the day during which [sunlight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunlight "Sunlight") directly reaches the ground, assuming that there are no obstacles. The length of daytime averages slightly more than half of the 24-hour day. Two effects make daytime on average longer than night. The Sun is not a point but has an apparent size of about 32 [minutes of arc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute_of_arc "Minute of arc"). Additionally, the [atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_atmosphere "Earth's atmosphere")[refracts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction "Refraction") sunlight in such a way that some of it reaches the ground even when the Sun is below the horizon by about 34 minutes of arc. So the first light reaches the ground when the centre of the Sun is still below the horizon by about 50 minutes of arc.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day#cite_note-27) Thus, daytime is on average around 7 minutes longer than 12 hours.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day#cite_note-28)

Daytime is further divided into [morning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morning "Morning") and [afternoon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afternoon "Afternoon"). Morning occurs between [sunrise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrise "Sunrise") and [noon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noon "Noon").[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day#cite_note-29) Afternoon occurs between noon and [sunset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunset "Sunset"),[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day#cite_note-30) or between noon and the start of evening. This period of time sees humans' highest [body temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoregulation "Thermoregulation"),[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day#cite_note-31) an increase of [traffic collisions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision "Traffic collision"),[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day#cite_note-32) and a decrease of [productivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity "Productivity").[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day#cite_note-33)

### Twilight

[![Image 8](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/Twilight-dawn_subcategories.svg/250px-Twilight-dawn_subcategories.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Twilight-dawn_subcategories.svg)

[Twilight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twilight "Twilight") is the period before [sunrise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrise "Sunrise") and after [sunset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunset "Sunset") in which there is natural light but no direct sunlight.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day#cite_note-USNO-34) The morning twilight begins at [dawn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawn "Dawn") and ends at sunrise, while the evening twilight begins at sunset and ends at [dusk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dusk "Dusk"). Both periods of twilight can be divided into [civil twilight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_twilight "Civil twilight"), [nautical twilight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nautical_twilight "Nautical twilight"), and [astronomical twilight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_twilight "Astronomical twilight"). Civil twilight is when the sun is up to 6 degrees below the horizon; nautical when it is up to 12 degrees below, and astronomical when it is up to 18 degrees below.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day#cite_note-35)

[![Image 9](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Adolf_Stademann_Flusslandschaft_im_Mondschein.jpg/250px-Adolf_Stademann_Flusslandschaft_im_Mondschein.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Adolf_Stademann_Flusslandschaft_im_Mondschein.jpg)

[Night in art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_in_paintings_(Western_art) "Night in paintings (Western art)")

[Evening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evening "Evening") can begin before sunset and overlaps both twilight and night. Evening begins around 5 or 6 pm, or when the sun sets, and ends when one goes to bed.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day#cite_note-oed-36)[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day#cite_note-Britannica-37)[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day#cite_note-38)

### Night

[Night](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night "Night") or _nighttime_[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day#cite_note-39)[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day#cite_note-40)[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day#cite_note-41) is the period in which the sky is [dark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darkness "Darkness");[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day#cite_note-42) the period between [dusk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dusk "Dusk") and [dawn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawn "Dawn") when no light from the sun is visible.[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day#cite_note-43)[Light pollution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_pollution "Light pollution") during night can impact human and animal life, for example by disrupting sleep.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day#cite_note-44)[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day#cite_note-45)

### In other cultures

Divisions of the day into parts vary between cultures. For example, in Brazil, the day is divided into four periods of six hours each:[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day#cite_note-46)[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day#cite_note-47)[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day#cite_note-48)

| Period | Name |
| --- | --- |
| 00:00–05:59 | _madrugada_ |
| 06:00–11:59 | _manhã_ |
| 12:00–17:59 | _tarde_ |
| 18:00–23:59 | _noite_ |

6.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day#cite_ref-6)**Certain authors caution against identifying "day" with rotation period. For example: Seligman, Courtney. ["Rotation Period and Day Length"](http://cseligman.com/text/sky/rotationvsday.htm).

A Cautionary Note: Because the rotation period of the Earth is almost the same as the length of its day, we sometimes get a bit sloppy in discussing the rotation of the sky, and say that the stars rotate around us once each day. In a similar way, it is not unusual for careless people to mix up the rotation period of a planet with the length of its day, or vice versa.
