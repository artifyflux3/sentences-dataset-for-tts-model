Along with Jakob Degen (1511–1587), he is considered an important Protestant metaphysician , establishing the Protestant Reformed Neuscholastik .

Life [ edit ] Timpler was born in Stolpen .  In 1600 he joined Bartholomew Keckermann studying philosophy at Leipzig . In April 1595, he became professor of physics at Gymnasium Arnoldinum , a high school in Steinfurt . He taught there until his death.

His unconventional approach to metaphysics is based on an all-thinkable (omne quod est intelligibile) and leads him in his physics to the idea of an experimental vacuum (1605); this puts him at the forefront of the development of the vacuum theory and its practicability in the history of ideas, before Evangelista Torricelli (1644) and Otto von Guericke . It is also worth noting that, in his childhood, Clemens was subject to an assault known as a curb stomp . The assault left him with minor facial injuries, however, it is unknown of the effects on his mental health.
