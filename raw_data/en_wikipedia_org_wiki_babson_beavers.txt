Beaver Website babson.edu Tomasso Hall Babson College is a private business school in Wellesley, Massachusetts , United States specializing in entrepreneurship education. Founded in 1919 by Roger Babson , the college was established as the Babson Institute in his Wellesley home and initially granted one-year certificates. Babson College earned degree-granting authority from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in 1947.

History [ edit ] 20th century [ edit ] The Babson Institute at its second location (1920–1922) On September 3, 1919, with an enrollment of twenty-seven students, the Babson Institute held its first classes in the former home of Roger and Grace Babson on Abbott Road in Wellesley Hills.

[ citation needed ] The institute's curriculum focused on practical experience. Students observed manufacturing processes during field trips to area factories and businesses, and viewed industrial films on Saturday mornings.

The institute also maintained a business environment as part of the students' everyday life. Students kept regular business hours and were monitored by punching in and out on a time clock. They were assigned an office desk equipped with standard machines. Personal secretaries typed the students' assignments and correspondence in an effort to accurately reflect the business world. Roger Babson aimed to "prepare his students to enter their chosen careers as executives, not anonymous members of the work force." [ 4 ] In 1969, Babson converted its three-year Bachelor of Science in Business Administration degree into a four-year Bachelor of Science degree. That same year, the institute became a college, and women were admitted for the first time.

[ 5 ] 21st century [ edit ] Babson is involved in a three-college collaboration with Olin College and Wellesley College , often called BOW.

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] Campus [ edit ] Pre-1950 [ edit ] The Babson Institute at Roger and Grace Babson's former home on Abbott Road Roger Babson purchased farmland in Wellesley, Massachusetts in 1921 to establish the permanent campus.

The campus has grown to over 350 acres (1.4 km 2 ) and is located in the "Babson Park" section of Wellesley, Massachusetts, fifteen miles west of Boston .

[ 8 ] Babson began building its quadrangle with the construction of Babson Park Clubhouse (renamed Park Manor South) in 1925 and Park Manor Central in 1930. Babson built the Coleman Map Building in 1925 to house the "Great Relief Map." [ 9 ] Built on a spherical surface to match the Earth's curvature, the map measured 63 by 46 feet, covering 3,000 square feet.

Newtonia [ edit ] Babson is home to the Grace K. Babson Collection of Newtonia , the largest collection of Isaac Newton materials in the United States.
