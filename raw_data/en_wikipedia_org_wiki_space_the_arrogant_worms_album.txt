**The Arrogant Worms** are a [Canadian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadians "Canadians") musical [comedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy "Comedy") trio founded in 1991 that parodies many [musical genres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_genre "Musical genre"). They are well known for their humorous on-stage banter in addition to their music.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(The_Arrogant_Worms_album)#cite_note-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(The_Arrogant_Worms_album)#cite_note-2) The members have been Trevor Strong (vocals), Mike McCormick (guitar, vocals), and Chris Patterson (bass, vocals) since 1995.

The Arrogant Worms formed in 1991, with its founding members being Trevor Strong, Mike McCormick, John Whytock, and Steve Wood. They began by performing musical comedy on [campus radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campus_radio "Campus radio") station [CFRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFRC "CFRC") at [Queen's University at Kingston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen%27s_University_at_Kingston "Queen's University at Kingston"),[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(The_Arrogant_Worms_album)#cite_note-3) and quickly moved to doing the same on [CBC Radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBC_Radio_One "CBC Radio One"), particularly on Jack Farr's _[The Radio Show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Radio\_Show "The Radio Show")_. Wood left the band in 1991. Whytock left in 1995, and was replaced by Chris Patterson.

The Worms have toured Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom,[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(The_Arrogant_Worms_album)#cite_note-4) and Australia, playing to crowds as large as 100,000. They have played at celebrations on [Parliament Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_Hill "Parliament Hill") in Ottawa, and at a concert in New York, United States's [Central Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Park "Central Park").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(The_Arrogant_Worms_album)#cite_note-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(The_Arrogant_Worms_album)#cite_note-6)

Since 1992 the Worms have released twenty-one albums, mostly independently, with sales exceeding 175,000.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(The_Arrogant_Worms_album)#cite_note-7)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(The_Arrogant_Worms_album)#cite_note-8) Their songs pay homage, always humorously, to different genres and topics. In 2003, they released a CD and DVD that was recorded live with the [Edmonton Symphony Orchestra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton_Symphony_Orchestra "Edmonton Symphony Orchestra").[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(The_Arrogant_Worms_album)#cite_note-9) Some of their albums include contributions from prominent musicians, including Andy Thompson, Andrew Affleck, Gord Thompson, Adrian Dolan, [Mike Ford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Ford_(musician) "Mike Ford (musician)"), John Loughrey, [Terry Tufts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Tufts "Terry Tufts") and Tim Readman, who is also their dialect coach.

[Rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music "Rock music"), [folk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_music "Folk music"), [ballads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballad "Ballad"), [country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music "Country music"), and [children's music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children%27s_music "Children's music") all have been genres parodied by the Worms. When not spoofing a particular style of music, the Worms' material pokes fun at various aspects of daily life in Canada with songs like "Canada's Really Big", "Me Like [Hockey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_hockey_in_Canada "Ice hockey in Canada")", "We Are the Beaver", "I Am Not American", and "Proud to Be Canadian".

They have also recorded [music videos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_video "Music video") for three songs: "Big Fat Road Manager", "Carrot Juice Is Murder",[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(The_Arrogant_Worms_album)#cite_note-10) and "The River (River of Snot)". The first two of these are included on the _[Three Worms and an Orchestra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three\_Worms\_and\_an\_Orchestra "Three Worms and an Orchestra")_ DVD, which includes appearances by [Tom Cavanagh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Cavanagh "Tom Cavanagh"), [Nathan Fillion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Fillion "Nathan Fillion") and [Kurt Browning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Browning "Kurt Browning").

The band has long supported the cause of [literacy in Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literacy_in_Canada "Literacy in Canada"), and have twice won the [Peter Gzowski Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Gzowski_Award "Peter Gzowski Award") for their efforts.
