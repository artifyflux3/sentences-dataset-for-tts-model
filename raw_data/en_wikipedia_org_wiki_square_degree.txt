SI units ≈ 3.046 17 × 10 −4 sr arcsec 2 12,960,000 arcsec 2 A square degree ( deg 2 ) is a non- SI unit measure of solid angle . Other denotations include sq. deg.

and (°) 2 . Just as degrees are used to measure parts of a circle, square degrees are used to measure parts of a sphere .

Analogous to one degree being equal to ⁠ π / 180 ⁠ radians, a square degree is equal to ( ⁠ π / 180 ⁠ ) 2 steradians (sr), or about ⁠ 1 / 3283 ⁠ sr or about 3.046 × 10 −4 sr .
The whole sphere has a solid angle of 4 π sr which is approximately 41 253 deg 2 : 4 π π ( 180 π π ) 2 deg 2 = 360 2 π π deg 2 = 129 600 π π deg 2 ≈ ≈ 41 252.96 deg 2 .

{\displaystyle 4\pi \left({\frac {180}{\pi }}\right)^{2}\,{\deg }^{2}={\frac {360^{2}}{\pi }}~{\deg }^{2}={\frac {129\,600}{\pi }}~{\deg }^{2}\approx 41\,252.96~{\deg }^{2}.} Subdivisions [ edit ] Each square degree is equal to 3600 square arcminutes , and each square arcminute is equal to 3600 square arcseconds . So, each square degree is equal to 12,960,000 square arcseconds. The whole sphere contains about 148.51 million square arcminutes and about 534.64 billion square arcseconds.

Examples [ edit ] The full moon covers only about 0.2 deg 2 of the sky when viewed from the surface of the Earth. The Moon is only a half degree across (i.e. a circular diameter of roughly 0.5° ), so the moon's disk covers a circular area of: π ( ⁠ 0.5° / 2 ⁠ ) 2 , or 0.2 square degrees. The moon varies from 0.188 to 0.244 deg 2 depending on its distance from the Earth.

Viewed from Earth, the Sun is roughly half a degree across (the same as the full moon) and covers only 0.2 deg 2 as well.

It would take 210 100 times the full moon (or the Sun) to cover the entire celestial sphere.

Conversely, an average full moon (or the Sun) covers a 2 / 210 100 fraction, or less than 1/1000 of a percent ( 0.000 009 523 81 ) of the celestial hemisphere, or above-the-horizon sky.

Assuming the Earth to be a sphere with a surface area of 510 million km 2 , the area of Northern Ireland ( 14 130 km 2 ) represents a solid angle of 1.14 deg 2 , Connecticut ( 14 357 km 2 ) represents a solid angle of 1.16 deg 2 , Equatorial Guinea ( 28 050 km 2 ) represents a solid angle of 2 deg 2 .

The largest constellation, Hydra , covers a solid angle of 1303 deg 2 , whereas the smallest, Crux , covers only 68 deg 2 .
