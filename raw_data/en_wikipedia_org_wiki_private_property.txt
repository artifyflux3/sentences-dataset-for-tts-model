**Private property** is a legal designation for the ownership of [property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property "Property") by non-governmental [legal entities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacity_(law) "Capacity (law)").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_property#cite_note-1) Private property is distinguishable from [public property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_property "Public property"), which is owned by a state entity, and from [collective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_ownership "Collective ownership") or [cooperative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative "Cooperative") property, which is owned by one or more [non-governmental entities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_entities "Non-governmental entities").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_property#cite_note-2) Private property is foundational to [capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism "Capitalism"), an [economic system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_system "Economic system") based on the private ownership of the [means of production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Means_of_production "Means of production") and their operation for [profit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profit_(economics) "Profit (economics)").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_property#cite_note-3) As a legal concept, private property is defined and enforced by a country's [political system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_system "Political system").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_property#cite_note-SAGE_Publications,_Inc-4)

In absolute antiquity, the native Mesopotamians had no term for the concept of property. The majority of legal documents from Mesopotamia, however, are overwhelmingly concerned with the proper disposition of what modern people would call 'property', with ensuring legal, unchallengeable, and fair treatment of individuals with property claims. While there were no laws prohibiting the alienation—that is, the buying and selling—of land, written records from Mesopotamia indicate a tendency against it. Measures were taken to keep land within a family and to keep it from being broken down into plots too small to be viable agriculturally.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_property#cite_note-5)

Written discussions of private property arguably emerged in the Western tradition at least as far back as [Plato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato "Plato").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_property#cite_note-6) Before the 18th century, English speakers generally used _property_ to refer to [land ownership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landed_property "Landed property"). In England, _property_ came to have a legal definition in the 17th century.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_property#cite_note-7) Private property defined as property owned by commercial entities emerged with the great European [trading companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chartered_company "Chartered company") of the 17th century.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_property#cite_note-8) The issue of the [enclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enclosure "Enclosure") of agricultural land in England, especially as debated in the 17th and 18th centuries, accompanied efforts in philosophy and political thought—by [Thomas Hobbes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hobbes "Thomas Hobbes") (1588–1679), [James Harrington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Harrington_(author) "James Harrington (author)") (1611–1677), and [John Locke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Locke "John Locke") (1632–1704), for example—to address the phenomenon of property [ownership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ownership "Ownership").[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_property#cite_note-9)

In arguing against supporters of [absolute monarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_monarchy "Absolute monarchy"), Locke conceptualized property as a natural right that God had not bestowed exclusively on the monarchy. In his [labor theory of property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_theory_of_property "Labor theory of property"), Locke stated that property is a natural result of labor improving upon nature, and thus by labor expenditure the laborer becomes entitled to its produce.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_property#cite_note-Property_Rights_in_the_History_of_Economic_Thought:_From_Locke_to_J.S._Mill-10) Influenced by the rise of [mercantilism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercantilism "Mercantilism"), Locke argued that private property was antecedent to and thus independent of government. Locke distinguished between "common property", by which he meant [common land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_land "Common land"), and property in consumer goods and producer-goods. His chief argument for property in land ownership was that it led to improved land management and cultivation over common land.

In the 18th century, during the [Industrial Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution "Industrial Revolution"), the moral philosopher and economist [Adam Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Smith "Adam Smith") (1723–1790), in contrast to Locke, distinguished between the "right to property" as an acquired right, and natural rights. Smith confined natural rights to "liberty and life". Smith also drew attention to the relationship between employee and employer and identified that property and civil government were dependent upon each other, recognizing that "the state of property must always vary with the form of government". Smith further argued that civil government could not exist without property, as the government's main function was to define and safeguard property ownership.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_property#cite_note-Property_Rights_in_the_History_of_Economic_Thought:_From_Locke_to_J.S._Mill-10)

In the 19th century, the economist and philosopher [Karl Marx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx "Karl Marx") (1818–1883) provided an influential analysis of the development and history of property formations and their relationship to the technical [productive forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productive_forces "Productive forces") of a given period. Marx's conception of private property has proven influential for many subsequent economic theories and for [communist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist "Communist"), [socialist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist "Socialist"), and [anarchist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchist "Anarchist") political movements, and led to the widespread association of private property—particularly private property in the [means of production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Means_of_production "Means of production")—with [capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism "Capitalism").

Private property is a legal concept defined and enforced by a country's [political system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_system "Political system").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_property#cite_note-SAGE_Publications,_Inc-4) The area of law that deals with the subject is called [property law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_law "Property law"). The enforcement of property law concerning _private_ property is a matter of _public_ expense. [Defence of property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_of_property "Defence of property") is a common method of [justification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justification_(jurisprudence) "Justification (jurisprudence)") used by [defendants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_defense "Legal defense") who argue that they should not be held liable for any loss and [injury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury "Injury") that they have caused because they were acting to protect their [property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property "Property"). [Courts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court "Court") have generally ruled that the [use of force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_of_force "Use of force") may be acceptable.

In many political systems, the government requests that owners pay for the privilege of ownership. A [property tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_tax "Property tax") is an [ad valorem tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_valorem_tax "Ad valorem tax") on the value of a property, usually levied on [real estate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate "Real estate"). The tax is levied by the governing authority of the jurisdiction in which the property is located. It may be imposed annually or at the time of a [real estate transaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate_transaction "Real estate transaction"), such as in [real estate transfer tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate_transfer_tax "Real estate transfer tax"). Under a property-tax system, the government requires or performs an [appraisal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate_appraisal "Real estate appraisal") of the monetary value of each property, and tax is assessed in proportion to that value. The four broad types of property taxes are [land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_(economics) "Land (economics)"), [improvements to land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_development "Land development") (immovable human-made objects, such as buildings), [personal property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_property "Personal property") (movable human-made objects), and [intangible property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intangible_property "Intangible property").

The social and political context in which private property is administered will determine the extent to which an owner will be able to exercise rights over the same. The rights to private property often come with limitations. For example, local government may enforce rules about what kind of building may be built on private land ([building code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_code "Building code")), or whether a historical building may be demolished or not. [Theft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft "Theft") is common in many societies, and the extent to which central administration will pursue [property crime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_crime "Property crime") varies enormously.

Some forms of private property are uniquely identifiable and may be described in a [title](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_(property) "Title (property)") or a certificate of ownership. The rights to a property may be transferred from one "owner" to another. A [transfer tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_tax "Transfer tax") is a tax on the passing of title to property from one person (or entity) to another. An owner may request that, after death, private property be transferred to family members, through [inheritance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance "Inheritance"). In certain cases, ownership may be lost to the public interest. Private real estate may be [confiscated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confiscated "Confiscated") or used for public purposes, for example to build a road.

[Factories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory "Factory") and corporations are considered private property.

[![Image 3: Photo of straight railway track with shiny rails and well-formed ballast laid level with the tops of the concrete sleepers or crossties](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Australian_National_Railways_track_with_concrete_sleepers.jpg/330px-Australian_National_Railways_track_with_concrete_sleepers.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Australian_National_Railways_track_with_concrete_sleepers.jpg)

[Railway tracks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railway_track "Railway track") are also considered private property, as walking on them is illegal.

The legal framework of a country or society defines some of the practical implications of private property. There are no expectations that these rules will define a rational and consistent model of economics or social system. Although contemporary [neoclassical economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoclassical_economics "Neoclassical economics")—currently the dominant school of economics—rejects some of the assumptions of the early philosophers underpinning classical economics, it has been argued that neoclassical economics continues to be influenced by the legacy of natural moral theory and the concept of [natural rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_law "Natural law"), which has led to the presentation of private market exchange and private property rights as "natural rights" inherent in nature.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_property#cite_note-11)

[Economic liberals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_liberals "Economic liberals") (defined as those who support a [private sector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_sector "Private sector")-driven market economy) consider private property to be essential for the construction of a prosperous society. They believe private ownership of land ensures the land will be put to productive use and its [value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(economics) "Value (economics)") protected by the [landowner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landowner "Landowner"). If the owners must pay [property taxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_taxes "Property taxes"), this forces the owners to maintain a productive output from the land to keep taxes current. Private property also attaches a monetary value to land, which can be used to [trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade "Trade") or as [collateral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collateral_(finance) "Collateral (finance)"). Private property thus is an important part of capitalization within the [economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_system "Economic system").[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_property#cite_note-12)

[Socialist economists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_economists "Socialist economists") are critical of private property as socialism aims to substitute private property in the means of production for [social ownership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_ownership "Social ownership") or [public property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_property "Public property"). Socialists generally argue that private property relations limit the potential of the [productive forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productive_forces "Productive forces") in the economy when the productive activity becomes a collective activity, where the role of the capitalist becomes redundant (as a passive owner). Socialists generally favor social ownership either to eliminate the [class distinctions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_distinctions "Class distinctions") between owners and workers and as a component of the development of a [post-capitalist economic system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-capitalism "Post-capitalism").[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_property#cite_note-13)

In response to the socialist critique, the [Austrian School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_School "Austrian School") economist [Ludwig Von Mises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Von_Mises "Ludwig Von Mises") argued that private property rights are a requisite for what he called rational economic calculation and that the prices of goods and services cannot be determined accurately enough to make efficient economic calculation without having clearly defined private-property rights. Mises argued that a socialist system, which by definition would lack private property in the factors of production, would be unable to determine appropriate price valuations for the factors of production. According to Mises, this problem would make rational socialist calculation impossible.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_property#cite_note-14)

In [capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism "Capitalism"), ownership can be viewed as a "bundle of rights" over an asset that entitles its holder to a strong form of authority over it. Such a bundle is composed of a set of rights that allows the owner of the asset to control it and decide on its use, claim the value generated by it, exclude others from using it, and the right to transfer the ownership (set of rights over the asset) of it to another holder.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_property#cite_note-15)[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_property#cite_note-16) In [Marxian economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxian_economics "Marxian economics") and socialist politics, a distinction is made between "private property" and "[personal property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_property "Personal property")". The former is defined as the means of production about private ownership over an economic enterprise based on [socialized production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialization_(economics) "Socialization (economics)") and [wage labor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wage_labor "Wage labor") whereas the latter is defined as [consumer goods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_goods "Consumer goods") or goods produced by an individual.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_property#cite_note-17)[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_property#cite_note-18) Prior to the 18th century, private property usually referred to [land ownership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landed_property "Landed property").

Private property in the [means of production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Means_of_production "Means of production") is the central element of capitalism criticized by socialists. In Marxist literature, private property refers to a social relationship in which the property owner takes possession of anything that another person or group produces with that property and capitalism depends on private property.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_property#cite_note-19) The socialist critique of private ownership is heavily influenced by the [Marxist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxist "Marxist") analysis of capitalist property forms as part of its broader critique of [alienation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marx%27s_theory_of_alienation "Marx's theory of alienation") and [exploitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploitation_of_labor "Exploitation of labor") in capitalism. Although there is considerable disagreement among socialists about the validity of certain aspects of Marxist analysis, the majority of socialists are sympathetic to Marx's views on exploitation and alienation.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_property#cite_note-20)

Socialists critique the private appropriation of property income because such income does not correspond to a return on any productive activity and is generated by the [working class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_class "Working class"), it represents exploitation. The [bourgeoisie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourgeoisie "Bourgeoisie"), the property-owning (capitalist) class, lives off passive property income produced by the [proletariat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proletariat "Proletariat") (working population) by their claim to ownership in the form of stock or private equity. This exploitative arrangement is perpetuated due to the structure of capitalist society. Capitalism is regarded as a class system akin to historical class systems like [slavery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery "Slavery") and [feudalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feudalism "Feudalism").[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_property#cite_note-21)

Private ownership has been criticized on non-Marxist ethical grounds by advocates of [market socialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_socialism "Market socialism"). According to the economist James Yunker, the ethical case for market socialism is that because passive property income requires no mental or physical exertion on the part of the recipient, and its appropriation by a small group of private owners is the source of the vast inequalities in contemporary capitalism, social ownership in a market economy would resolve the major cause of social inequality and its accompanying social ills.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_property#cite_note-22) Weyl and Posner argue that private property is another name for monopoly and can hamper allocative efficiency. Through the use of taxation and modified [Vickrey auctions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vickrey_auction "Vickrey auction"), they argue that partial common property ownership is a more efficient and just way to organize the economy.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_property#cite_note-23)

The justifications for private property rights have also been critiqued as tools of empire that enable land appropriation.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_property#cite_note-:0-24) According to academic commentator Brenna Bhandar, the language implemented in property legislation dictates colonized peoples as unable to effectively own and utilize their land.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_property#cite_note-:0-24) It is suggested that personal rights are interchangeable with property rights, therefore communities that utilize communal methods of land ownership are not equally validated by private property ideals.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_property#cite_note-25) It is also argued by critical race theorist [Cheryl Harris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheryl_Harris "Cheryl Harris") that race and property rights have been conflated over time, with only those qualities unique to white settlement recognized legally.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_property#cite_note-26) Indigenous use of land, focusing on common ownership, is distinguished from private property ownership and Western understandings of [land law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_law "Land law").[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_property#cite_note-27)

The main strength of the legitimating role of economic theory is that it allows one set of ideological viewpoints to posture as if their conclusions were unbiased scientific conclusions, while those opposing them were merely expressing their value-laden opinions. At its apex, this tendency has justified laissez-faire economic policies as if they were based on natural laws. Always behind the legitimization activities of economists is the belief that markets are 'natural' institutions and market outcomes are natural outcomes, and the institutions necessary for markets, such as private property rights, are 'natural rights'.

18.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_property#cite_ref-18)**_Capital, Volume 1_, by Marx, Karl. From "Chapter 32: Historical Tendency of Capitalist Accumulation": "Self-earned private property, that is based, so to say, on the fusing together of the isolated, independent laboring-individual with the conditions of his labor, is supplanted by capitalistic private property, which rests on the exploitation of the nominally free labor of others, i.e., on wage-labor. As soon as this process of transformation has sufficiently decomposed the old society from top to bottom, as soon as the laborers are turned into proletarians, their means of labor into capital, as soon as the [capitalist mode of production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalist_mode_of_production_(Marxist_theory) "Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)") stands on its own feet, then the furtsocializationtion of labor and further transformation of the land and other means of production into socially exploited and, therefore, common means of production, as well as the further expropriation of private proprietors, takes a new form. That which is now to be expropriated is no longer the laborer working for himself, but the capitalist exploiting many laborers."

Though socialists have disagreed with Marx about how to conceptualize the notion of class, about the dynamics of class societies, and indeed about a whole host of other matters, most socialists seem to be broadly sympathetic to his views about what is wrong with the capitalist (free enterprise) economic system and, by implication, capitalist society... Marx's critique attributes two systemic evils to capitalism's economic system: alienation and exploitation.

Property income is, by definition, received by owning property... Since such income is not an equivalent return for any productive activity, it amounts to an entitlement to a portion of the aggregate output of others' productive activity. The workforce produces output but surrenders part of it to people who have nothing directly to do with production. Arguably, this occurs by a social system to which those in the workforce have never given their full consent, i.e. that of private property. Alternatively, it occurs by a structure of power to which the workforce is subject: property income is the fruit of exploitation. The fact that it is essential to capitalism makes the latter a class system akin to such other historical cases as slavery and feudalism.

From the human point of view, the return paid to non-human factors of production is unearned and equivalent to a gift of nature. It is the personal appropriation of this gift of nature by a small minority of society under contemporary capitalism that establishes the ethical unworthiness of capitalism and the desirability of a socialist transformation...The employment of capital instruments and natural resources in economic production requires no personal hardship or exertion from any human being. The economic services provided by these factors of production are not corporeally inherent in human beings. The opposite is true of labor services, which can only be provided through the physical and mental activity of human beings...the really grossly exaggerated personal incomes in society are dominated by property income, and this source of inequality would be abrogated by the equalization of property income distribution.
