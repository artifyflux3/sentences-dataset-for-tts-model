' Army of Air and Space ' ) is the air and space force of the French Armed Forces .

[ 1 ] Formed in 1909 as the Service Aéronautique ("Aeronautical Service"), a service arm of the French Army , it became an independent military branch in 1934 as the French Air Force ( Armée de l'air ). On 10 September 2020, it assumed its current name, the French Air and Space Force, to reflect an "evolution of its mission" into the area of outer space .

[ 2 ] The number of aircraft in service with the French Air and Space Force varies depending on the source; the Ministry of Armed Forces gives a figure of 658 aircraft in 2014.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] According to 2025 data, this figure includes 207 combat aircraft: 99 Dassault Mirage 2000 and 108 Dassault Rafale .

[ 5 ] As of 2021, [update] the French Air and Space Force employs a total of 40,500 regular personnel, with a reserve element of 5,187 in 2014.

[ 6 ] The Chief of Staff of the French Air and Space Force (CEMAAE) is a direct subordinate of the Chief of the Defence Staff (CEMA), a high-ranking military officer who in turn answers to the civilian Minister of the Armed Forces .

The following year, another Wright biplane, a Bleriot , and two Farmans were added to the lone acquisition. On 22 October 1910, General Pierre Roques was appointed Inspector General of what was becoming referred to as the Cinquieme Arme, or Fifth Service.

[ 8 ] In March 1912, the French parliament enacted legislation to establish the air arm. It was projected to consist of three distinct branches based on aircraft missions—reconnaissance, bombing, or countering other aircraft.

[ 8 ] Inventing the fighter plane [ edit ] France was one of the first states to start building aircraft. At the beginning of World War I , France had a total of 148 planes (eight from French Naval Aviation ( Aéronautique Navale )) and 15 airships .

[ 9 ] In August 1914, as France entered World War I, French airpower consisted of 24 squadrons ( escadrilles ) supporting ground forces, including three squadrons assigned to cavalry units. By 8 October, expansion to 65 squadrons was being planned. By December, the plans called for 70 new squadrons.

[ 8 ] Meanwhile, even as procurement efforts scaled up, inventive airmen were trying to use various light weapons against opposing airplanes.

Roland Garros invented a crude method of firing a machine gun through the propeller arc by cladding his propeller with metal wedges deflecting any errant bullets. After destroying three German airplanes, Garros came down behind enemy lines on 18 April 1915. His secret weapon was thus exposed, and Anthony Fokker came up with the synchronization gear that by July 1, 1915 , turned airplanes into flying gun platforms.

[ 10 ] "Company of aviators", September 1914, by Jules Gervais-Courtellemont French aircraft during World War I , flying over German held territory (1915) Nieuport-Delage NiD.29 C.1 fighter used in the early post-WWI period.

Founding fighter formations [ edit ] On 21 February 1916, the Verdun Offensive began. New weapons demanded new tactics.

Commandant Charles de Tricornet de Rose was the original French pilot, having learned to fly in March 1911. This experienced flier was given a free hand to select pilots and airplanes for a new unit tasked with keeping German observation craft from over the French lines. The ad hoc unit commandeered all available Morane-Saulniers and Nieuport 11s , as well as the 15 best pilots regardless of posting. This ad hoc unit patrolling the skies over Verdun was the first French Groupement de Chasse . The Groupement was successful despite Tricornet's death in a mishap. Under the leadership of new commander Captain Auguste de Reverand, such flying aces as Georges Guynemer , Charles Nungesser , and Albert Deullin began their careers.

[ 11 ] Encouraged by the success of their original Groupement , the French massed several squadrons for the Battle of the Somme . The burgeoning French aircraft inventory afforded the formation of Groupement de Combat de la Somme under Captain Felix Brocard . The Groupement was formed on 1 July 1916 with a posting of four Nieuport squadrons: Squadron N.3 , N.26 , N.73 , and N.103 . Three other squadrons-- Squadron N.37 , N.62 , and N.65 were temporarily attached at various times.

[ 11 ] On 19 October 1916, three fixed Groupes de Combat were established, each to consist of four squadron. Numbered 11 , 12 , and 13 , they were only the first three Groupements .

[ 11 ] Concentrating airpower [ edit ] During March 1917, Groupe de Combat 14 and Groupe de Combat 15 were formed. Again, each new Groupe was assigned four Nieuport fighter squadrons; again, each was sent to support a different French field army .

[ 11 ] On 10 January 1918, Groupe de Combat 16 was formed from four SPAD squadrons. In February, five more Groupe de Combats were founded from SPAD squadrons: Groupes de Combats number 17, 18, 19, 20, and 21. The various Nieuport models were now being phased out as the new SPADs filled the inventories of the French.

[ 12 ] With the Groupes success, the French were encouraged to amass airpower into still larger tactical units. On 4 February 1918, Escadre de Combat No. 1 was created out of Groupe de Combat 15 , Groupe de Combat 18 , and Groupe de Combat 19 . It was followed by Escadre de Combat No. 2 , formed on the 27th from Groupe de Combat 11 , Groupe de Combat 13 , and Groupe de Combat 17 . Each groupe would be stocked with 72 fighters.

[ 13 ] The escadres were not the end of the French accumulation of air power. On 14 May 1918, they were grouped into the Division Aerienne . As bombing aircraft were also being concentrated into larger units, the new division would also contain Escadre de Bombardement No. 12 and Escadre de Bombardement No. 13 . The bombing units were both equipped with 45 Breguet 14 bombers. The last addition to the new division was five protection squadrons, operating 75 Caudron R.11 gunships to fly escort for the Breguets.

[ 13 ] On 25 June 1918, Groupe de Combat 22 was founded.

Groupe de Combat 23 followed soon thereafter. A couple of night bombardment groupes were also founded.

[ 14 ] Committing the Division Aerienne [ edit ] Then, on 15 July 1918, the Division was committed to the Second Battle of the Marne .

[ 15 ] From then on, whether in whole or in part, the Division Aerienne fought until war's end. By the time of the Battle of Saint-Mihiel , the French could commit 27 fighter squadrons to the effort, along with reconnaissance and bombing squadrons. The 1,137 airplanes dedicated to the battle were the most numerous used in a World War I battle.

[ 16 ] When the 11 November 1918 armistice came, French air power had expanded to 336 squadrons, 74 of which were SPAD fighter squadrons. France had 3,608 planes in service.

[ 9 ] Confirmed claims of 2,049 destroyed enemy airplanes included 307 that had been brought down within French lines. French airmen had also destroyed 357 observation balloons .

[ 16 ] However, 5,500 pilots and observers were killed out of the 17,300 engaged in the conflict, amounting to 31%.

[ 17 ] A 1919 newspaper article reported that the French Air Force had suffered losses of 61%.

[ 18 ] Interwar period [ edit ] Dewoitine D.510 monoplane fighters from the mid-1930s Military aeronautics was established as a "special arm" by the law of 8 December 1922.

[ 19 ] It remained under the auspices of the French Army . It was not until 2 July 1934, that the "special arm" became an independent service and was totally independent.

[ 20 ] The initial air arm was the cradle of French military parachuting , responsible for the first formation of the Air Infantry Groups ( Groupements de l'Infanterie de l'Air ) in the 1930s, out of which the Air Parachute Commandos ( commandos parachutistes de l'air ) descended.

The French Air Force maintained a continuous presence across the French colonial empire , particularly from the 1920s to 1943.

[ 21 ] [ 22 ] World War II [ edit ] The French Air Force played an important role in WWII, most notably during the Battle of France in 1940. The Vichy French Air Force had later a significant presence in the French Levant .

The engagement of the Free French Air Forces from 1940 to 1943, and then the engagement of the aviators of the French Liberation Army , were also important episodes in the history of the French Air Force. The sacrifices of Commandant René Mouchotte and Lieutenant Marcel Beau illustrated their devotion.

1945–present [ edit ] A North American T-28 Trojan , used against guerrillas during the Algerian War After 1945, France rebuilt its aircraft industry. The French Air Force participated in several colonial wars during the Empire such as French Indochina after the Second World War. Since 1945, the French Air Force was notably engaged in Indochina (1945–1954).

[ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] The French Air Force was active in Algeria from 1952 until 1962 and Suez (1956), later Mauritania and Chad , [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] the Persian Gulf (1990–1991), [ 29 ] ex- Yugoslavia [ 30 ] [ 31 ] and more recently in Afghanistan , Mali and Iraq .

[ 32 ] [ 33 ] [ 34 ] [ 35 ] [ 36 ] [ 37 ] From 1964 until 1971 the French Air Force had the unique responsibility for the French nuclear arm via Dassault Mirage IV or ballistic missiles of Air Base 200 Apt-Saint-Christol on the Plateau d'Albion.

Mirage IIIC of EC 2/10 "Seine" pictured in 1980 armed with a Matra R.530 Accordingly, from 1962, the French political leadership shifted its military emphasis to nuclear deterrence , implementing a complete reorganisation of the Air Force, with the creation of four air regions and seven major specialised commands, among which were the Strategic Air Forces Command , COTAM, the Air Command of Aerial Defense Forces ( Commandement Air des Forces de Défense Aérienne , CAFDA), and the Force aérienne tactique (FATac).

[ 38 ] In 1964, the Second Tactical Air Command was created in Nancy to take command of air units stationed in France but not assigned to NATO . The Military Air Transport Command had previously been formed in February 1962 from the Groupement d'Unités Aériennes Spécialisées . Also created in 1964 was the Escadron des Fusiliers Commandos de l'Air (EFCA), seemingly grouping all FCA units. The Dassault Mirage IV , the principal French strategic bomber, was designed to strike Soviet positions as part of the French nuclear triad .

In 1985, the Air Force had four major flying commands, the Strategic Air Forces Command , the Tactical Air Forces Command, the Military Air Transport Command , and CAFDA (air defence).

CFAS had two squadrons of S2 and S-3 IRBMs at the Plateau d'Albion, six squadrons of Mirage IV As (at Mont de Marsan , Cazaux, Orange, Istres, St Dizier, and EB 3/94 at Luxeuil - Saint-Sauveur Air Base ), and three squadrons of C-135F , as well as a training/reconnaissance unit, CIFAS 328, at Bordeaux . The tactical air command included wings EC 3, EC 4, EC 7, EC 11, EC 13, and ER 33, with a total of 19 squadrons of Mirage III, Jaguars, two squadrons flying the Mirage 5 F (EC 2/13 and EC 3/13, both at Colmar ), and a squadron flying the Mirage F.1 CR. CoTAM counted 28 squadrons, of which ten were fixed-wing transport squadrons, and the remainder helicopter and liaison squadrons, at least five of which were overseas. CAFDA numbered 14 squadrons mostly flying the Mirage F.1 C. Two other commands had flying units, the Air Force Training Command , and the Air Force Transmissions Command, with four squadrons and three trials units.

Dassault Aviation led the way mainly with delta-wing designs, which formed the basis for the Dassault Mirage III series of fighter jets . The Mirage demonstrated its abilities in the Six-Day War , Yom Kippur War , Falklands War , and Gulf War , becoming one of the most popular jet fighters of its day and being widely sold.

In 1994, the Fusiliers Commandos de l'Air command was reestablished under a different form.

The Air Force ordered the Airbus A400M military transport aircraft, then in development. By November 2016, 11 had already been delivered to ET00.061 at Orleans-Bricy, and integration of the new Dassault Rafale multi-role jet fighter was underway; the first 20-aircraft squadron became operational in 2006 at Saint-Dizier .

In 2009, France rejoined the NATO Military Command Structure , having been absent since 1966.

[ 40 ] France was a leading nation, alongside the United States , United Kingdom and Italy in implementing the UN sponsored no-fly zone in Libya (NATO Operation Unified Protector ), deploying 20 fighter aircraft to Benghazi in defense of rebel-held positions and the civilian population.

[ 41 ] The last remaining squadron of Dassault Mirage F1s retired the aircraft in July 2014 and replaced them with Dassault Rafales .

[ 42 ] Logo between 2010 and 2020 On 13 July 2019, President Emmanuel Macron announced the creation of a space command, which would come into being within the French Air Force by September 2019, and the transformation of the French Air Force into the French Air and Space Force.

[ 43 ] According to Defense Minister Florence Parly , France reserves the right to arm French satellites with lasers for defensive purposes.

[ 44 ] The official renaming occurred on 24 July 2020, with the new Air and Space Force logo unveiled on 11 September 2020.

[ 2 ] On 26 July 2023, FASF conducted its first ever joint fighter exercise with Japan , continuing its defense ties between the two countries.

They are responsible for the preparation and logistic support of the French Air and Space Force. The CEMAA is assisted by a Deputy Chief, the Major Général de l'Armée de l'Air , who is the Chief of Staff of the Air and Space Forces Staff. Finally, the CEMAA is assisted by the Inspectorate of the French Air and Space Force (IAA) and by the French Air and Space Force Health Service Inspection (ISSAA).

The Air and Space Force is organized in accordance with Chapter 4, Title II, Book II of the Third Part of the French Defense Code ( French : code de la Défense ), which replaced decree n° 91-672 dated 14 July 1991.

Under the authority of the Chief of Staff of the French Air and Space Force (CEMAAE) in Paris , the Air and Space Force includes: Chief of Staff of the French Air and Space Force , heading the État-major de l'Armee de l'air et de l'espace (EMAAE) Forces Air Bases Directorate of Human Resources of the French Air and Space Force Services [ 46 ] The Air and Space Force headquarters, employing 150 personnel, are located alongside the Chief of the Defence Staff 's offices (EMA) and the Army and Navy headquarters at the Balard armed forces complex in Paris. The new site replaced the former Paris Air Base (BA 117) which served as air staff headquarters until 25 June 2015.

Air and Space Army Staff [ edit ] The Air and Space Army Staff ( État-major de l'Armée de l'air et de l'espace ) is the highest service-specific authority of the French air force. It is formally under the command of the Chief of Staff of the Air and Space Force (CEMAAE), but the organisation is under the direct authority of his deputy, the Major General of the Air and Space Force ( major général de l'Armée de l'air et de l'espace (MGAAE), in the French military tradition a 'Major General' is not a military rank, but the designation of Chief of Staff of a high command.)

[ 57 ] Created by the merger of the former Airspace Control Brigade ( Brigade Aérienne de Contrôle de l'Espace ( BACE )) and the Information and Communication Systems component ( Systèmes d'information et de communication ) of the Air Force Brigade for Aerial Maneuver Support ( Brigade aérienne d'appui à la manœuvre aérienne ). The BACE was responsible for ( Airborne early warning and control aircraft, and ground radar, ground-based air defense systems and missile defence, communication networks) airspace surveillance, constituting the Système de Commandement et de Conduite des Opérations Aérospatiales ). Since 2007 the command, control and information systems network of the air and space force have been is integrated into the Joint Directorate of Infrastructure Networks and Information Systems (DIRISI)). With the creation of the BACEA the surface-to-air missile squadrons were transferred to the Air Force Fighter Aviation Brigade. The annual post-statement of the Air Defence and Air Operations Command ( COMMANDEMENT DE LA DÉFENSE AÉRIENNE ET DES OPÉRATIONS AÉRIENNES - Rétrospective 2023 ) [ 58 ] describes the new brigade as a formation of 57 subordinated units and its HQ in Bordeaux, fulfilling the following key tasks: tactical control of air assets (contrôle tactique), aerial transit control of air assets (contrôle en route), air traffic control (contrôle de circulation aérienne), support of the information and communication systems of the air force (soutien des Sic Aéronautiques), training and expertise in air traffic management (formation et expertise ATM), forward deployment of information and communication systems and command and control assets (projection SIC et du C2 tactique).

By 2025 the CMOS and the COSMOS will relocate to Toulouse Space Center as well. In preparation for this the French Air and Space Force has formed the military installation FA 101 ( Formation administrative ( FA 101 )) on the premises of the space center.

[ 63 ] Space Operations Command and Control Center ( Centre de Commandement et de Contrôle des opérations spatiales ( C3OS )), based at Toulouse Space Center Satellite Observation Military Center 01.092 "Bourgogne" ( French : Centre militaire d’observation par satellites (CMOS) 01.092 Bourgogne ), based at Creil -Senlis Air Base (BA 110) Operational Center for Military Surveillance of Space Objects ( French : Centre opérationnel de surveillance militaire des objets spatiaux (COSMOS) ), based at Lyon – Mont Verdun Air Base (BA 942) The official designation of the service was changed in July 2019 from Air Army ( Armée de l'Air ) to Air and Space Army ( Armée de l'air et de l'espace ), when the previous joint Inter-Service Space Command ( Commandement interarmées de l'espace ( CIE )) under the French General Staff was transformed into the Space Command ( Commandement de l'espace ( CDE )) and absorbed into the Air and Space Force as its fourth command.

All air regions were disestablished on 1 January 2008. In the 1960s, there were five air regions (RA). The number was then reduced to four by a decree of 30 June 1962 with the disestablishment of the 5th Aerial Region ( French North Africa ). The decree of 14 July 1991 reduced the air regions to three: « RA Atlantic », « RA Mediterranean » and «  RA North-East ». On 1 July 2000 was placed into effect an organization consisting of « RA North » (RAN) and « RA South » (RAS). The territorial division was abolished by decree n°2007-601 of 26 April 2007.

[ 64 ] [ 65 ] From 2008 to 2010 the French Air Force underwent the "Air 2010" streamlining process. The main targets of this project were to simplify the command structure, to regroup all military and civil air force functions and to rationalise and optimise all air force units. Five major commands, were formed, instead of the former 13, and several commands and units were disbanded.

[ 66 ] Support services [ edit ] The Directorate of Human Resources of the Air and Space Force (DRH-AAE) recruits, trains, manages, administers, and converts personnel of the Air and Space Force. Since January 2008, the DRH-AAE groups the former Air Force directorate of military personnel (DPMMA) and some tasks of the former Air Force Training Command . The directorate is responsible for Air and Space Force recruitment via the recruiting bureau.

French joint defence service organisations, supporting the air and space force, include: [ 46 ] The Integrated Structure of Maintaining Operational Conditioning of Aeronautical Defense Materials ( French : Structure Intégrée de Maintien en Condition Opérationnelle des Matériels Aéronautiques de la Défense ) (SIMMAD).

The Service industriel de l'aéronautique ( French : Service Industriel de l'Aéronautique ) (SIAE), a 4700-person maintenance organization, internal to the French air force, in charge of 20% of the heavy maintenance of French armed forces , the other 80% being the responsibility of private aeronautics companies.

The " Air Commissariat " ( French : " Commissariat de l'Air " ) between 1947 and 2007, then " Financial and General Administration Service " ( French : " Service de l'Administration Générale et des Finances " (SAGF) ) from 2008 until 2009, and finally the " Commissariat Service of the Armed Forces " (SCA) ( French : Service du Commissariat des Armées ) since 2010, have successively been designated as administrative services of the French Air and Space Force. The Commissioners as well as Civilians of this service carry out : operations support, individual legal rights, judicial, internal control accountability, financial and purchase executions, and support and protection of the combatant.

[ 67 ] Wings [ edit ] Commanded by a Lieutenant-colonel or Colonel, the Escadre is a formation that assembles various units and personnel dedicated to the same mission. In 1932, the "regiment" designation was replaced with "Escadre", which until 1994 was a unit consisting of the following: units (escadrons or groups) generally equipped with the same type of aircraft or at least assuring the same type of mission units of maintenance and support.

Escadres ( wings ) were dissolved from 1993 as part of the Armées 2000 reorganisation, were reestablished in 2014.

[ 68 ] The problems caused by having the aircraft maintenance units not responsible to the flying squadrons they supported eventually forced the change.

Four Escadres were reformed in the first phase: [ 68 ] 31e Escadre Aérienne de Ravitaillement et de Transport Stratégiques at Istres-Le Tubé Air Base on 27 August 2014 36e Escadre de Commandement et de Conduite Aéroportée at Avord Air Base on 5 September 2014 Escadre Sol-Air de Défense Aérienne – 1er Régiment d'Artillerie de l'Air (ESADA – 1 er RAA) at Avord Air Base (3 September 2014) the 3 e Escadre de Chasse at Nancy-Ochey Air Base (5 September 2014) In the second phase, the French Air Force announced in August 2015 the creation of six additional wings: [ 68 ] the 8e Escadre de Chasse at Cazaux Air Base (25 August 2015) the 4e Escadre de Chasse at Saint-Dizier ( 26 August 2015) the 64e Escadre de Transport at Évreux-Fauville Air Base (27 August 2015) the 2e Escadre de Chasse at Luxeuil - Saint-Sauveur Air Base (3 September 2015) the 61e Escadre de Transport ( fr:61e escadre de transport ) at Orléans – Bricy Air Base (1 September 2015) the 30e Escadre de Chasse at Mont-de-Marsan Air Base (3 September 2015).

Also established was the Escadre Aérienne de Commandement et de Conduite Projetable at Évreux-Fauville Air Base on 27 August 2015.

The French Air and Space Force announced in August 2015 that unit numbering, moves of affected aircraft, and the transfer of historic material (flags, traditions and names) would be completed in 2016.

[ 68 ] the 62e Escadre de Transport was re-constituted at Orléans – Bricy Air Base on 5 September 2017, taking over C-130 Hercules operations from 61e Escadre de Transport so the latter could specialise in A400M Atlas operations.

Another air force wing was added on September 5, 2019: the 33e Escadre de surveillance, de reconnaissance et d'attaque at Cognac – Châteaubernard Air Base , operating the air and space force's drone fleet.

Squadrons and flights [ edit ] Commanded by a lieutenant-colonel, the Escadron is the basic operational unit. This term replaced that of Group as of 1949 with the aim to standardize usage with the allies of NATO who were using the term 'squadron'. However, the term Group did not entirely disappear: the term was retained for the Aerial Group 56 Mix Vaucluse, specialized in Special Operations or Group – Groupe de Ravitaillement en Vol 02.091 Bretagne ( French : Groupe de Ravitaillement en Vol 02.091 Bretagne ) which is still carrying the same designation since 2004.

[ citation needed ] A fighter squadron ( escadron ) can number some twenty machines, spread in general in three Escadrilles. A Transport Escadron ( Escadron de Transport ) can theoretically count a dozen Transall C-160 , however, numbers are usually much less for heavier aircraft (three Airbus A310-300 and two Airbus A340-200 for the Transport Escadron 3/60 Estérel ( French : Escadron de Transport 3/60 Estérel )).

[ citation needed ] The squadrons have retained the designations of the former Escadres disbanded during the 1990s. For instance: Transport Escadron 1/64 Béarn ( French : escadron de transport 1/64 Béarn ) (more specifically Transport Escadron 01.064 Béarn), which belonged to the 64th Transport Escadre ( French : 64 e Escadre de Transport ) during the dissolution of the later (recreated in August 2015). Not all escadrons (Squadrons) are necessarily attached to an Escadre.

[ citation needed ] The Escadrille (flight) has both an administrative and operational function, even of the essential operational control is done at the level of the Esacdron. A pilot is assigned to the Escadrille, however the equipment and material devices, on the other hand, are assigned to the Escadron. Since the ESTA (Aeronautic Technical Support Escadrons) came into being, material devices and the mechanics have been assigned directly to the base then put at disposition of the based Escadrons.

[ citation needed ] The Escadrilles adopted the traditions of the prestigious units out of which most (SPA and SAL), [ note 1 ] are those traditions of the First World War.

[ citation needed ] Fusiliers Commandos de l'Air [ edit ] The Fusiliers Commandos de l'Air comprise: [ 69 ] Protection squadrons ( French : Escadrons de protection ) (EP) Air Parachute Commando 10 ( French : Commando parachutiste de l'air ) (CPA 10) Air Parachute Commando 20 (CPA 20) Air Parachute Commando 30 (CPA 30) Protection Squadrons protect airbases inside and outside the national territory, and in exterior operations as well.

The CPAs carry out common missions, as well as specialized tasks including intervention and reinforcement of protection at the profit of sensible points " air " inside and outside the national territory.

Air bases [ edit ] Main article: List of French Air and Space Force bases Air bases in Metropolitan France Flying activity in France is carried out by a network of bases, platforms and French air and space defence radar systems . It is supported by bases, which are supervised and maintained by staff, operational centres, warehouses, workshops, and schools. Both in France and abroad, bases have similar infrastructure to provide standardised support.

The French Air and Space Force has, as of 1 August 2014: Within the metropolitan territory of France, 27 airbases, out of the which 18 aeronautical platform with perceived runways and 5 Bases non-platform, two schools, 3 air detachments and " one attached air element " (EAR).

Beyond the metropole/Europe, 7 Aerial Bases or permanent detachments in overseas or country.

A French Air and Space Force Dassault Rafale B at RIAT in 2009 Crotale missile-launchers of the Air Defense Ground-to-Air Squadron of the French Air and Space Force Some French airbases house radar units (e.g. Lyon, Mont-Verdun, Drachenbronn, Cinq-Mars-la-Pile, Nice, Mont-Agel) to carry out air defence radar surveillance and air traffic control. Others house material warehouses or command posts. Temporary and semi-permanent foreign deployments include transport aircraft at Dushanbe ( Tajikistan , Operation Héraclès ), and fighter aircraft in N'Djamena ( Tchad , Opération Épervier ), among others.

As swift as the French Air and Space Force operates, the closure of aerial bases is more constant and immediate, having known a strong acceleration since the 1950s. An air base commander has authority over all units stationed on their base. Depending on the units' tasks, this means that they are responsible for approximately 600 to 2500 personnel.

On average, a base, made up of about 1500 personnel (nearly 3500 people including family), provides a yearly economic boost to its area of about 60 million euros. Consequently, determining the sites for air bases constitutes a major part of regional planning.

The F2 standard was the first to be delivered to the French Air Force and was introduced in 2006 (the F1 standard representing the first 10 Rafale production units delivered to the French Navy as an emergency replacement for its F-8 Crusader carrier-based fighters). The Rafale F3 entered operational service in 2009 and the F3-R standard in 2018. The Rafale F4 is scheduled to enter operational service in 2025 and the Rafale F5 in the early 2030s.
