For other uses, see Permissiveness (disambiguation) .

A permissive society , also referred to as permissive culture , is used to describe a society in which social norms become increasingly liberal, especially with regard to sexual freedom and profanity .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] The term is often used pejoratively by cultural conservatives to criticise what is seen as a breakdown in traditional values , such as greater acceptance of premarital sex , an increase in divorce rates, and acceptance of non-traditional relationships such as cohabitation and homosexuality .

A. P. Herbert , an English humorist, novelist, playwright, law reformist, and Member of Parliament, has been described as the "Father of the Permissive Society," particularly for his championing of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1937 , which extended the grounds for divorce.

[ 4 ] It was particularly used during the sexual revolution which peaked in the early 1970s in Western culture by opponents of the changes in attitudes of the era.
