It reflects an interplay between rapid industrial growth, cultural preservation, and sustainable development. The nation has undertaken major efforts to integrate comprehensive planning across administrative levels, from special districts and redevelopment zones to smart city platforms and urban-rural landscape policies, to balance modernization with community needs and ecological resilience.

Taiwan’s urban planning is governed primarily by the Urban Planning Act, which delineates three types of plans: city/town plans, countryside street plans, and special district plans, distinguishing between new urban developments and renewal of older, dilapidated areas.

[ 1 ] Local governments periodically update their plans, aligning with national policies on sustainable land use, green space, disaster mitigation, and urban–rural integration.

History [ edit ] Japanese Colonial Period (1895 - 1945) [ edit ] Tainan urban planning map (1911) During Japan's rule over Taiwan , urban planning was used as a tool of colonial control and modernization. A total of 72 cities and towns were part of the urban planning, with a total area of about 52,500 ha (130,000 acres) and a total planned population of about 3.26 million.

[ 2 ] The first urban plan announced in Taiwan was the "Taichung City Design Plan" announced in January 1894, but the "Taipei City Inner City Plan" in August of the same year was the first urban plan to be implemented. The latest announcements were the Shanhua Urban Plan and the Shirakawa Urban Plan in 1943.

[ 3 ] Urban planning formally began during this period, when cities like Taipei were redesigned into colonial administrative centers, featuring monumental civic buildings and axial avenues, wide boulevards, grid layouts, and civic spaces inspired by Tokyo ’s urban form. The previous narrow and winding roads and poor sanitary environment were replaced by wide and straight roads, roundabouts, parks and other public facilities, as well as the standardization of building settings.

The colonial government introduced modern urban planning concepts into Taiwan, drawing inspiration from European models—especially the Haussmann renovation of Paris—with the goal of transforming outdated, densely built environments into more sanitary, organized, and visually coherent cities. Early efforts, known as Chinese : 市區改正 (urban corrections), were regionally targeted projects to modernize public infrastructure. Initiated in Taipei in 1899, the First Urban Improvement Plan included widening streets, improving drainage, removing parts of the old city walls, and constructing quarters such as Ximending to accommodate Japanese settlers. Between 1899 and 1917, similar reforms were extended to locations such as Keelung , Taichung , Tainan , Hsinchu County , and Kaohsiung —eventually encompassing a total of 20 urban centers.

During the assimilation phase, from 1919 to 1936, advanced techniques such as zoning regulations, public parks, and sanitation infrastructure were progressively introduced. Notable projects included the establishment of a centralized government district and the implementation of land-use regulations to control urban expansion. The 1920 Taiwan City Ordinance elevated Taipei, Taichung, and Tainan to city status, granting them limited self-governance via city councils—laying early foundations for urban administration.

By 1921, colonial authorities determined that piecemeal improvements no longer sufficed. A comprehensive planning system was explored, aiming to parallel Japan’s own 1919 City Planning Act. Though initial attempts stalled, this led to the establishment of a preparatory committee in 1934 and culminated in the issuance of the 1936 Taiwan City Planning Order (臺灣都市計畫令). The Order introduced formal zoning of land into residential, commercial, and industrial areas as well as regulated aesthetic, fire safety, scenic, and moral districts.

[ 4 ] A centralized Taiwan City Planning Committee was created to oversee these regulations, supplemented by regional committees. Although only 21 full-scale urban planning schemes were authorized before outbreak of regional warfare, their legal framework and spatial concepts deeply shaped Taiwan’s post-war development. The legacy of this period persisted until 1964, when Taiwan (under the Republic of China government) formally adopted its own Urban Planning Act, replacing the Japanese-era ordinance. In parallel with city planning, related legislation reformed municipal governance.

Early Postwar Era (1945 - 1970s) [ edit ] After the Republic of China assumed control of Taiwan in 1945, Taiwanese cities entered a period of rapid but largely uncoordinated urban development. The influx of Chinese Civil War refugees, which had account to over two million by 1949, and early industrialization triggered massive internal migration from rural to urban areas, particularly in Taipei. Between 1945 and 1950, Taipei's population rose by more than 168,000 – approximately 50% – with informal settlements, Military dependents' villages and squatters burgeoning in peripheral districts. By the late 1950s, an estimated 15,000 squatter homes existed in Taipei, rising to over 50,000 by the early 1960s as land and housing scarcity mounted.

[ 5 ] Much of the postwar urban expansion focused on reconstruction of war-torn infrastructure and rapid accommodation of fleeing populations. Under U.S. aid programs in the early 1950s, significant road widening, bridge repairs, and construction of air-raid shelters were undertaken—projects primarily aimed at defense but which also improved street layout and public sanitation.

[ 6 ] In Taipei, elevated highways and industrial zones were added haphazardly, with minimal integration of strategic long-term planning, thus producing sprawling suburbs and large swaths of informal housing.

To meet growing housing needs, the government introduced public housing and military dependents' villages during the late 1940s–1950s. These were largely modest units built on public land to house soldiers’ families and bureaucrats. Though basic, by the 1960s they were improved with brick construction and utilities, serving as early models of organized housing, albeit largely restricted to military or civil service personnel. Some larger villages, such as Four Four West Village in Taipei, housed high-ranking military officers and solidified community ties in enclosed residential compounds.

[ 7 ] Despite these interventions, urban growth continued unchecked. The government’s attempted satellite town developments, such as Yonghe in the 1950s, adopted Garden city movement layouts based on Clarence Perry ’s Neighbourhood unit design. However, without sufficient transport links or employment hubs, these schemes often failed to substantially shift population away from city centers. Simultaneously, industrial estates concentrated along the Western Corridor—especially in areas like Taichung, Kaohsiung, and export processing zones—spurred further rural exodus and urban expansion.

[ 8 ] Urban planning remained fragmented during this period, with limited regulation and few metropolitan-level strategies. As a result, suburbs spread unevenly around cities like Taipei and Kaohsiung, often following highway routes rather than public transit. This pattern persisted into the 1970s, creating infrastructure and congestion challenges that would later be addressed through formalized urban planning policies.

Economic Boom and the Ten Major Constructions (1980s) [ edit ] In the 1970s and 1980s, Taiwan underwent a transformative phase under the Ten Major Construction Projects , launched in 1974 by Premier Chiang Ching-kuo . These initiatives aimed to rectify infrastructure deficiencies exposed by the 1973 oil crisis and to modernize the nation’s transportation, energy, and industrial backbone. There were six transportation projects, three industrial projects, and one power-plant construction project, which ultimately cost over NT$ 300 billion in total.

[ 9 ] These projects reshaped Taiwan’s geography and economy. Highway travel times between Taipei and Keelung halved, industrial logistics improved dramatically, and interconnected transport systems catalyzed export-led growth.

In 1988, the Urban Planning Law was amended to introduce “reserved land” (for public facilities) and transferable development rights (TDR). This allowed private developers to build denser mixed-use projects near transit hubs by purchasing unused floor area allocated to public lands.

[ 10 ] Although modeled after U.S. practice, Taiwan’s floating-TDR system was less regulated, leading to significant densification — over 3,700 projects used TDR to add the equivalent of more than 100,000 new apartments — while largely bypassing community input or public capture of land-value gains.

[ 11 ] Rise of Landmark Urban Projects (1990s - 2000s) [ edit ] Xinyi Planning District core area map From the 1990s through the early 2000s, Taiwan’s urban planning entered a new era characterized by high-profile, skyline-defining projects that reshaped city identities and boosted international appeal. Central to this trend was Taipei 101 , completed in 2004. Designed by architect C.Y. Lee & Partners , this 508 m supertall skyscraper became the tallest building in the world upon opening and earned LEED Platinum certification for its environmental design.

[ 12 ] Taipei 101 was conceived not only to pioneer engineering feats, such as earthquake- and typhoon-resistant elements including the 660-ton tuned mass damper and one of the world's fastest elevators, but also to symbolize Taiwan's global modernity and cultural identity, emulating a bamboo stalk to reflect resilience and prosperity.

Simultaneously, large-scale mixed-use districts like Xinyi Planning District and Xinban Special District emerged as integrative urban models. The Xinyi District, designed from the 1970s and developed during the 1980s and 1990s, arranged Taipei 101 alongside Taipei City Hall , Taipei International Convention Center , and multiple department stores in a 153-hectare area, establishing Taipei’s financial and commercial hub.

[ 13 ] Its planning, led by Japanese architect Kaku Morin , prioritized coherent street grids, transit integration, and high-density vertical development, positioning the zone as a potent urban engine.

[ 14 ] The district’s luxurious skyline and brand-centered architecture helped cement Taipei’s identity as a globalized urban center.

[ 15 ] In neighboring New Taipei City, the Xinban Special District also took shape during this period. Centered around the newly built Banqiao Station , it has since grown into the city’s administrative and commercial core. Covering 54 ha (130 acres), the district integrates mass transit, government offices, retail complexes, and civic plazas, emerging as a counterbalance to Taipei’s more established central business districts.

[ 16 ] These developments marked a paradigmatic shift in Taiwan’s urban planning—from reactive growth to proactive, large-scale, transit-oriented development.

Together, the rise of landmark architecture and strategically developed districts elevated Taiwan’s urban landscape. By combining iconic architecture with integrated transport, commercial retail, and high-density zoning, these projects reshaped city skylines, fostered economic vitality, and repositioned Taiwan’s metropolises, particularly Taipei, as internationally recognizable, modern cities.

2010s to present [ edit ] In the 2010s and beyond, Taiwan’s urban planning has pivoted toward sustainability , smart city technology, and renewal of ageing districts. The Taipei West District Gateway Project , initiated around Taipei Main Station , exemplifies this transformation by focusing on pedestrian-focused redesigns, public space enhancements like Beimen Plaza and Taipei Travel Plaza, and culturally sensitive redevelopment that marries historical preservation with modern needs.

[ 17 ] [ 18 ] A major infrastructure landmark currently under construction is the Danjiang Bridge , designed by Zaha Hadid Architects. When completed around 2026, this 920 m asymmetric single-tower cable-stayed bridge will be the world’s longest of its kind. It is conceived to accommodate carriages, buses, light rail, cyclists, and pedestrians, while connecting Tamsui and Bali districts. Designed with environmental sensitivity, the bridge minimizes visual and ecological impact in the Tamsui River estuary.

Taipei's skyline is set for further change with the Taipei Twin Towers , currently under construction adjacent to Taipei Main Station. These towers will feature a multi-modal transit hub integrating Taiwan High Speed Rail , Taipei metro , Taoyuan Airport MRT , along with retail, office, and hotel facilities. Upon completion in 2027, they will become Taiwan’s second tallest building after Taipei 101.

At Taoyuan International Airport , efforts are underway to build Terminal 3, which is expected to integrate smart-city infrastructure, low-carbon building techniques, and sustainable transit options. The project is showcased in Taiwan’s Smart City Summit & Expo as part of national efforts toward electrified transport and net-zero environmental goals.

Taipei City’s green agenda is supported by legislative tools such as streamlining mixed-use zoning, promoting transit-oriented development (TOD), and updating regulations to encourage pedestrian and cyclist-friendly environments. The transformation of floodways and riverbanks into public amenities, supported by green-infrastructure strategies in areas like the New Taipei Metropolitan Park , illustrates Taiwan's intent to combine ecological resilience with recreational improvements.

Overall, Taiwan's urban planning in recent years demonstrates a clear shift: from reactive, car-centric development to forward-thinking, resilient, and equitable urban environments. This era emphasizes public engagement, integrated mobility networks, green infrastructure, and the reuse of city spaces toward safer, denser, and more sustainable urban living.

Sustainable cities [ edit ] Taiwan has shown dedication to become a regional leader in sustainable urban development, implementing a range of initiatives across its cities to address environmental challenges and promote green living by integrating environmental, social, and technological strategies to create livable and resilient cities.

Taipei City has undertaken significant efforts to mitigate the urban heat island effect through its "Taipei Street Trees 15-Year Vision Plan," which focuses on planting new trees and shrubs to connect green spaces and enhance biodiversity.

[ 19 ] Additionally, the city transformed the former Fudekeng landfill into the Fudekeng Environmental Restoration Park , which now houses Taipei's first large-scale solar power plant.

[ 20 ] New Taipei City has prioritised sustainable transportation by promoting public transit and active travel to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Wenzizun Redevelopment Zone is also envisioned by the city government to become a centre of high quality of life in the Greater Taipei Area by 2030, aligning with Sustainable Development Goal 11 .

[ 21 ] Kaohsiung has implemented green building regulations, resulting in numerous structures with green rooftops and water retention systems. The city is also home to the world's largest solar-powered sports stadium, underscoring its commitment to renewable energy.

[ 22 ] Tainan was selected as Taiwan's first demonstration city for the Healthy Cities project, focusing on interdisciplinary approaches to public health and urban planning.

[ 23 ] The city has also repurposed former industrial sites into community spaces, contributing to its sustainable urban development.

Keelung has advanced sustainable tourism through initiatives like the revitalization of Heping Island Park, promoting environmental education and conservation efforts.

[ 24 ] Taichung transformed a former airport into Phase Shift Park, an ecological urban space featuring diverse plant species and solar-powered technology, serving as a "green lung" for the city.

[ 25 ] Reception [ edit ] Taiwan’s urban planning approach has drawn frequent criticism for its car-centric bias and inadequate infrastructure for pedestrians.

[ 26 ] A CNN feature in December 2022 starkly described Taiwan’s traffic environment as a “living hell for pedestrians,” highlighting poorly designed crossings, a lack of sidewalks, and weak enforcement of pedestrian priority—especially outside major cities, where nearly half of roads wider than 12 m lack sidewalks entirely.

[ 27 ] This is reflected in fatality statistics: in early 2025, 410 pedestrian deaths were recorded, and on wider roads without sidewalks, hazard levels remain high.

[ 28 ] Pedestrian advocates have long argued for the same: the proliferation of uneven walkways, overgrown pavements, obstructive fixtures such as transformer boxes, and businesses or scooters spilling onto sidewalks are common in urban areas.

[ 29 ] The Taipei Times editorial in April 2024 criticized the government’s ambitious but poorly enforced NT$40 billion pedestrian safety project, pointing to inconsistent sidewalk materials, uneven surfaces, and encroachments that have rendered many sidewalks virtually unusable.

[ 30 ] In response to growing pressure, including a march in early 2025, the Taipei City Government published a Road Design Manual, yet Vision Zero Taiwan cautions that divergent local ordinance standards and weak implementation continue to threaten pedestrian safety.

[ 31 ] Nationally, lawmakers are pushing for a Pedestrian Safety Facilities Act to set consistent sidewalk standards for roads over 8 m, regulate permitted sidewalk fixtures, and standardize walkways around construction zones.

[ 32 ] A second structural criticism stems from Taiwan’s permissive ‘floating’ transferable development rights (TDR) system. Unlike TDR frameworks in the U.S. that tie development rights to designated zones, Taiwan allows developers to transfer floor area almost anywhere, often resulting in density spikes and speculative land grabs. One analysis found nearly 3,800 TDR-approved projects since the early 2000s added 807 hectares of floor area—equivalent to more than 100,000 new high-end apartments—without clear public benefit or community input.

[ 10 ] Altogether, these challenges underscore two recurring critiques: first, the physical neglect of pedestrian and public spaces, resulting in unsafe and inhospitable environments; second, the extraction-driven urban development model, which frequently prioritizes private profit over cohesive planning, equitable density control, and resident interests.
