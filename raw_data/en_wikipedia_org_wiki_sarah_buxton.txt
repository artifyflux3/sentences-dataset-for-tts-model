**Sarah Jane Buxton** (born July 3, 1980) is an American [country music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music "Country music") singer formerly signed to the independent [Lyric Street Records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyric_Street_Records "Lyric Street Records"). Between 2006 and 2008, she issued three singles from an [extended play](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_play "Extended play") titled _[Almost My Record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almost\_My\_Record "Almost My Record")_, in addition to co-writing her song "[Stupid Boy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stupid_Boy "Stupid Boy")", which was later recorded by [Keith Urban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Urban "Keith Urban"). She released her [self-titled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Buxton_(album) "Sarah Buxton (album)") debut album in early 2010, led off by the Top 25 single "[Outside My Window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outside_My_Window_(Sarah_Buxton_song) "Outside My Window (Sarah Buxton song)")," shortly before Lyric Street Records closed.

Buxton was born in [Lawrence, Kansas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence,_Kansas "Lawrence, Kansas"). She became actively involved in music as a child by learning piano, playing flute and joining a children's choir. As she learned more about music, she became interested in songwriters and began writing poetry. After graduation, she met one of her musical idols, [Stevie Nicks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevie_Nicks "Stevie Nicks"), who encouraged her to pursue music and move to [Nashville, Tennessee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville,_Tennessee "Nashville, Tennessee").[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

Buxton enrolled at Nashville's [Belmont University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont_University "Belmont University")[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Buxton#cite_note-allmusic-1) and started a Southern rock band called Stoik Oak, which toured the region for three years. After an 18-month engagement, she married Christopher Robin of the Christopher Robin Band when she was 22. However, they divorced shortly[_[when?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual\_of\_Style/Dates\_and\_numbers#Chronological\_items "Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers")_] afterwards. She also felt discouraged about finding a place for her voice in the music business but found further encouragement from one of her friends, [John Rich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rich_(musician) "John Rich (musician)") of [Big & Rich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_%26_Rich "Big & Rich"). She asked her publisher to set up some co-writing sessions, and she became more confident in her approach to singing and songwriting. In the meantime, she sang [background vocals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Background_vocals "Background vocals") for [Kenny Rogers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Rogers "Kenny Rogers") and [John Corbett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Corbett_(actor) "John Corbett (actor)"),[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Buxton#cite_note-allmusic-1) in addition to singing duet vocals on [Cowboy Troy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowboy_Troy "Cowboy Troy")'s "If You Don't Wanna Love Me".[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Buxton#cite_note-cbt-2)

"[Stupid Boy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stupid_Boy "Stupid Boy")", one of Buxton's songs, was covered by [Keith Urban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Urban "Keith Urban"), on his mid-2006 album _[Love, Pain & the Whole Crazy Thing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love,\_Pain\_%26\_the\_Whole\_Crazy\_Thing "Love, Pain & the Whole Crazy Thing")_, taking his version to No.3 on the country charts in 2007.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Buxton#cite_note-reuters-3) Buxton sang backing vocals on the song "Tu Compañía" from the same album.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Buxton#cite_note-UrbanLiner-4)

Buxton signed to [Lyric Street Records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyric_Street_Records "Lyric Street Records") that same year and released her debut single "Innocence", which peaked at number 31 on the country music charts. It was followed by "That Kind of Day", which reached number 26 in 2007. Both were included on a five-song digital [extended play](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_play "Extended play") entitled _[Almost My Record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almost\_My\_Record "Almost My Record")_, released only to digital retailers in mid-2007.

Stewart Mason of [Allmusic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allmusic "Allmusic") wrote that Buxton has "an appealingly hoarse singing voice akin to [Melissa Etheridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melissa_Etheridge "Melissa Etheridge") and a no-nonsense lyrical persona somewhat along the lines of [Gretchen Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gretchen_Wilson "Gretchen Wilson")."[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Buxton#cite_note-allmusic-1)_Almost My Record_ received a positive review from _[Country Standard Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country\_Standard\_Time "Country Standard Time")_ critic Michael Sudhalter, who said that "Stupid Boy" worked better from a female's perspective, and that "Innocence" was "one of the best songs about reminiscing of young love since [Deana Carter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deana_Carter "Deana Carter")'s '[Strawberry Wine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strawberry_Wine_(Deana_Carter_song) "Strawberry Wine (Deana Carter song)")'."[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Buxton#cite_note-cst-9) Jessica Phillips of _[Country Weekly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country\_Weekly "Country Weekly")_ magazine wrote in her review of the album that Buxton's lyrics cast her as "a typical 20-something-year-old girl in America."[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Buxton#cite_note-10)

Buxton became engaged to session guitarist [Tom Bukovac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Bukovac "Tom Bukovac") on December 20, 2009.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Buxton#cite_note-11) They married on November 20, 2010.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Buxton#cite_note-12) She gave birth to their first child, Marshall, on December 4, 2012.
