CEMP stars have [C/Fe] > +1, which means compared to the Sun these stars have carbon enhanced at least ten times more than iron , and [Fe/H] < -1, meaning that iron is less than a tenth that in the Sun.

These are further categorized by whether r-process or s-process elements are enhanced. CEMP-no stars have no enhancement. Some of these are the earliest formed in the Milky Way . The others are termed CEMP-r, CEMP-s, or CEMP-r/s.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Metal-poor stars are more likely to be CEMP stars, and once [Fe/H] < -5.0, then all the stars are CEMP stars.

[ 1 ] Subdivisions [ edit ] CEMP-r stars have [ Eu /Fe] > +1 and [ Ba /Eu] < 0.

[ 1 ] CEMP-s stars have [Ba/Fe] > +1 and [Ba/Eu] > +0.5 [ 1 ] 80% of CEMP stars fall into this category.

[ 1 ] CEMP-r/s stars have [Ba/Eu] between 0 and +0.5 so they are under the level for CEMP-s stars.

[ 1 ] CEMP-no stars have [Ba/Fe] < 0.

[ 1 ] About 20% of CEMP stars fall into this category.
