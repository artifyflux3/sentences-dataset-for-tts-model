In [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics"), a **Unified Field Theory (UFT)** is a type of [field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_theory_(physics) "Field theory (physics)") that allows all [fundamental forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_forces "Fundamental forces") of nature, including gravity, and all [elementary particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_particle "Elementary particle") to be written in terms of a single physical [field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(physics) "Field (physics)").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_field_theory#cite_note-1) According to [quantum field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory "Quantum field theory"), particles are themselves the quanta of fields. Different fields in physics include vector fields such as the [electromagnetic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_field "Electromagnetic field"), spinor fields whose quanta are fermionic particles such as [electrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron "Electron"), and tensor fields such as the [metric tensor field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_tensor_(general_relativity) "Metric tensor (general relativity)") that describes the shape of spacetime and gives rise to gravitation in [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity"). Unified field theories attempt to organize these fields into a single mathematical structure.

For over a century, the unified field theory has remained an open line of research. The term was coined by [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein"), who attempted to unify his [general theory of relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity") with [electromagnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetism "Electromagnetism").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_field_theory#cite_note-2) Einstein attempted to create a [classical unified field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_unified_field_theories "Classical unified field theories"). Among other difficulties, this required a new explanation of particles as singularities or solitons instead of field quanta. Later attempts to unify general relativity with other forces incorporate quantum mechanics. The concept of a "[Theory of Everything](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_Everything "Theory of Everything")"[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_field_theory#cite_note-Hawking2006-3) or [Grand Unified Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Unified_Theory "Grand Unified Theory")[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_field_theory#cite_note-4) are closely related to unified field theory. A theory of everything attempts to create a complete picture of all events in nature. Grand Unified Theories do not attempt to include the gravitational force and can therefore operate entirely within quantum field theory. The goal of a unified field theory has led to significant progress in [theoretical physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_physics "Theoretical physics").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_field_theory#cite_note-5)

Unified field theory attempts to give a single elegant description of the following fields:[_[dubious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Accuracy\_dispute#Disputed\_statement "Wikipedia:Accuracy dispute") – [discuss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Unified\_field\_theory#Dubious "Talk:Unified field theory")_]

All four of the known fundamental forces are mediated by fields. In the [Standard Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model "Standard Model") of particle physics, three of these result from the exchange of [gauge bosons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_boson "Gauge boson"). These are:

*   [Strong interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_interaction "Strong interaction"): the interaction responsible for holding [quarks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark "Quark") together to form [hadrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadron "Hadron"), and holding [neutrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron "Neutron") and also [protons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton "Proton") together to form [atomic nuclei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_nucleus "Atomic nucleus"). The exchange particle that mediates this force is the [gluon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluon "Gluon").
*   [Electromagnetic interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_interaction "Electromagnetic interaction"): the familiar interaction that acts on electrically charged particles. The [photon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon "Photon") is the exchange particle for this force.
*   [Weak interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_interaction "Weak interaction"): a short-range interaction responsible for some forms of [radioactivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactivity "Radioactivity"), that acts on [electrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron "Electron"), [neutrinos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrino "Neutrino"), and quarks. It is mediated by the [W and Z bosons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W_and_Z_bosons "W and Z bosons").

[General relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity") likewise describes gravitation as the result of the metric tensor field, which describes the shape of [spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime "Spacetime"):

*   [Gravitational interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_interaction "Gravitational interaction"): a long-range attractive interaction that acts on _all_ particles. In hypothetical quantum versions of GR, the postulated exchange particle has been named the [graviton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graviton "Graviton").

In the Standard Model, the "matter" particles (electrons, quarks, neutrinos, etc) are described as the quanta of [spinor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor "Spinor") fields. Gauge boson fields also have quanta, such as [photons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon "Photon") for the electromagnetic field.

The Standard Model has a unique fundamental [scalar field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_field "Scalar field"), the [Higgs field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_field "Higgs field"), the quanta of which are called [Higgs bosons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_boson "Higgs boson").

The first successful [classical unified field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_unified_field_theories "Classical unified field theories") was developed by [James Clerk Maxwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell "James Clerk Maxwell"). In 1820, [Hans Christian Ørsted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Christian_%C3%98rsted "Hans Christian Ørsted") discovered that [electric currents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current "Electric current") exerted forces on [magnets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnet "Magnet"), while in 1831, [Michael Faraday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Faraday "Michael Faraday") made the observation that time-varying [magnetic fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field "Magnetic field") could induce electric currents. Until then, electricity and magnetism had been thought of as unrelated phenomena. In 1864, Maxwell published his famous paper on [a dynamical theory of the electromagnetic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Dynamical_Theory_of_the_Electromagnetic_Field "A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field"). This was the first example of a theory that was able to encompass previously separate field theories (namely electricity and magnetism) to provide a unifying theory of electromagnetism. By 1905, [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein") had used the constancy of the [speed-of-light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed-of-light "Speed-of-light") in Maxwell's theory to unify our notions of space and time into an entity we now call [spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime "Spacetime"). In 1915, he expanded this theory of [special relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity "Special relativity") to a description of gravity, [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity"), using a field to describe the curving geometry of four-dimensional (4D) spacetime.

In the years following the creation of the general theory, a large number of physicists and mathematicians enthusiastically participated in the attempt to unify the then-known fundamental interactions.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_field_theory#cite_note-6) Given later developments in this domain, of particular interest are the theories of [Hermann Weyl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Weyl "Hermann Weyl") of 1919, who introduced the concept of an (electromagnetic) [gauge field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_theory "Gauge theory") in a classical field theory[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_field_theory#cite_note-7) and, two years later, that of [Theodor Kaluza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodor_Kaluza "Theodor Kaluza"), who extended General Relativity to [five dimensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-dimensional_space "Five-dimensional space").[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_field_theory#cite_note-8) Continuing in this latter direction, Oscar Klein proposed in 1926 that the fourth spatial dimension be [curled up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compactification_(physics) "Compactification (physics)") into a small, unobserved circle. In [Kaluza–Klein theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaluza%E2%80%93Klein_theory "Kaluza–Klein theory"), the gravitational curvature of the extra spatial direction behaves as an additional force similar to electromagnetism. These and other models of electromagnetism and gravity were pursued by Albert Einstein in his attempts at a [classical unified field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_unified_field_theories "Classical unified field theories"). By 1930 Einstein had already considered the Einstein-Maxwell–Dirac System [Dongen]. This system is (heuristically) the super-classical [Varadarajan] limit of (the not mathematically well-defined) [quantum electrodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_electrodynamics "Quantum electrodynamics"). One can extend this system to include the weak and strong nuclear forces to get the Einstein–Yang-Mills–Dirac System. The French physicist [Marie-Antoinette Tonnelat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie-Antoinette_Tonnelat "Marie-Antoinette Tonnelat") published a paper in the early 1940s on the standard commutation relations for the quantized spin-2 field. She continued this work in collaboration with [Erwin Schrödinger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Schr%C3%B6dinger "Erwin Schrödinger") after [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II"). In the 1960s [Mendel Sachs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendel_Sachs "Mendel Sachs") proposed a generally covariant field theory that did not require recourse to renormalization or perturbation theory. In 1965, Tonnelat published a book on the state of research on unified field theories.

In 1963, American physicist [Sheldon Glashow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheldon_Glashow "Sheldon Glashow") proposed that the [weak nuclear force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_nuclear_force "Weak nuclear force"), electricity, and magnetism could arise from a partially unified [electroweak theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroweak_theory "Electroweak theory"). In 1967, Pakistani [Abdus Salam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdus_Salam "Abdus Salam") and American [Steven Weinberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Weinberg "Steven Weinberg") independently revised Glashow's theory by having the masses for the [W particle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W_particle "W particle") and [Z particle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_particle "Z particle") arise through [spontaneous symmetry breaking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_symmetry_breaking "Spontaneous symmetry breaking") with the [Higgs mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_mechanism "Higgs mechanism"). This unified theory modelled the [electroweak interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroweak_interaction "Electroweak interaction") as a force mediated by four particles: the photon for the electromagnetic aspect, a neutral Z particle, and two charged W particles for the weak aspect. As a result of the spontaneous symmetry breaking, the weak force becomes short-range and the W and Z bosons acquire masses of 80.4 and 91.2 GeV/c 2, respectively. Their theory was first given experimental support by the discovery of weak neutral currents in 1973. In 1983, the Z and W bosons were first produced at [CERN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CERN "CERN") by [Carlo Rubbia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Rubbia "Carlo Rubbia")'s team. For their insights, Glashow, Salam, and Weinberg were awarded the [Nobel Prize in Physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Physics "Nobel Prize in Physics") in 1979. Carlo Rubbia and [Simon van der Meer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_van_der_Meer "Simon van der Meer") received the Prize in 1984.

After [Gerardus 't Hooft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerardus_%27t_Hooft "Gerardus 't Hooft") showed the Glashow–Weinberg–Salam electroweak interactions to be mathematically consistent, the electroweak theory became a template for further attempts at unifying forces. In 1974, Sheldon Glashow and [Howard Georgi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Georgi "Howard Georgi") proposed unifying the strong and electroweak interactions into the [Georgi–Glashow model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgi%E2%80%93Glashow_model "Georgi–Glashow model"), the first [Grand Unified Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Unified_Theory "Grand Unified Theory"), which would have observable effects for energies much above 100 GeV.

Since then there have been several proposals for Grand Unified Theories, e.g. the [Pati–Salam model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pati%E2%80%93Salam_model "Pati–Salam model"), although none is currently universally accepted. A major problem for experimental tests of such theories is the energy scale involved, which is well beyond the reach of current [accelerators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_accelerator "Particle accelerator"). Grand Unified Theories make predictions for the relative strengths of the strong, weak, and electromagnetic forces, and in 1991 [LEP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Electron-Positron_Collider "Large Electron-Positron Collider") determined that [supersymmetric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_Supersymmetric_Standard_Model "Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model") theories have the correct ratio of couplings for a Georgi–Glashow Grand Unified Theory.

Many Grand Unified Theories (but not Pati–Salam) predict that [the proton can decay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_decay "Proton decay"), and if this were to be seen, details of the decay products could give hints at more aspects of the Grand Unified Theory. It is at present unknown if the proton can decay, although experiments have determined a lower bound of 10 35 years for its lifetime.

Theoretical physicists have not yet formulated a widely accepted, consistent theory that combines [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity") and [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics") to form a [theory of everything](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_everything "Theory of everything"). Trying to combine the [graviton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graviton "Graviton") with the strong and electroweak interactions leads to fundamental difficulties and the resulting theory is not [renormalizable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renormalization "Renormalization"). The incompatibility of the two theories remains an outstanding problem in the field of physics.
