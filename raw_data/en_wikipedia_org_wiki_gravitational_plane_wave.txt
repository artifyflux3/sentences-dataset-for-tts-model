[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] They are a special class of a vacuum pp-wave spacetime .

In general relativity , [ 5 ] the may be defined in terms of Brinkmann coordinates by d s 2 = [ a ( u ) ( x 2 − − y 2 ) + 2 b ( u ) x y ] d u 2 + 2 d u d v + d x 2 + d y 2 {\displaystyle ds^{2}=[a(u)(x^{2}-y^{2})+2b(u)xy]du^{2}+2dudv+dx^{2}+dy^{2}} Here, a ( u ) , b ( u ) {\displaystyle a(u),b(u)} can be any smooth functions ; they control the waveform of the two possible polarization modes of gravitational radiation .  In this context, these two modes are usually called the plus mode and cross mode , respectively.
