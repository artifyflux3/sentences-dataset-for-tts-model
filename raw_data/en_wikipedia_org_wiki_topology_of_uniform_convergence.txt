Studying space of linear maps and these topologies can give insight into the spaces themselves.

The article operator topologies discusses topologies on spaces of linear maps between normed spaces , whereas this article discusses topologies on such spaces in the more general setting of topological vector spaces (TVSs).

Topologies of uniform convergence on arbitrary spaces of maps [ edit ] Throughout, the following is assumed: T {\displaystyle T} is any non-empty set and G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} is a non-empty collection of subsets of T {\displaystyle T} directed by subset inclusion (i.e. for any G , H ∈ ∈ G {\displaystyle G,H\in {\mathcal {G}}} there exists some K ∈ ∈ G {\displaystyle K\in {\mathcal {G}}} such that G ∪ ∪ H ⊆ ⊆ K {\displaystyle G\cup H\subseteq K} ).

Y {\displaystyle Y} is a topological vector space (not necessarily Hausdorff or locally convex).

N {\displaystyle {\mathcal {N}}} is a basis of neighborhoods of 0 in Y .

{\displaystyle Y.} F {\displaystyle F} is a vector subspace of Y T = ∏ ∏ t ∈ ∈ T Y , {\displaystyle Y^{T}=\prod _{t\in T}Y,} [ note 1 ] which denotes the set of all Y {\displaystyle Y} -valued functions f : T → → Y {\displaystyle f:T\to Y} with domain T .

{\displaystyle T.} 𝒢-topology [ edit ] The following sets will constitute the basic open subsets of topologies on spaces of linear maps.
For any subsets G ⊆ ⊆ T {\displaystyle G\subseteq T} and N ⊆ ⊆ Y , {\displaystyle N\subseteq Y,} let U ( G , N ) := { f ∈ ∈ F : f ( G ) ⊆ ⊆ N } .

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {U}}(G,N):=\{f\in F:f(G)\subseteq N\}.} The family { U ( G , N ) : G ∈ ∈ G , N ∈ ∈ N } {\displaystyle \{{\mathcal {U}}(G,N):G\in {\mathcal {G}},N\in {\mathcal {N}}\}} forms a neighborhood basis [ 1 ] at the origin for a unique translation-invariant topology on F , {\displaystyle F,} where this topology is not necessarily a vector topology (that is, it might not make F {\displaystyle F} into a TVS). 
This topology does not depend on the neighborhood basis N {\displaystyle {\mathcal {N}}} that was chosen and it is known as the topology of uniform convergence on the sets in G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} or as the G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} -topology .

[ 2 ] However, this name is frequently changed according to the types of sets that make up G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} (e.g. the "topology of uniform convergence on compact sets" or the "topology of compact convergence", see the footnote for more details [ 3 ] ).

A subset G 1 {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}_{1}} of G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} is said to be fundamental with respect to G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} if each G ∈ ∈ G {\displaystyle G\in {\mathcal {G}}} is a subset of some element in G 1 .

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}_{1}.} In this case, the collection G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} can be replaced by G 1 {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}_{1}} without changing the topology on F .

{\displaystyle F.} [ 2 ] One may also replace G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} with the collection of all subsets of all finite unions of elements of G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} without changing the resulting G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} -topology on F .

{\displaystyle F.} [ 4 ] Call a subset B {\displaystyle B} of T {\displaystyle T} F {\displaystyle F} -bounded if f ( B ) {\displaystyle f(B)} is a bounded subset of Y {\displaystyle Y} for every f ∈ ∈ F .

{\displaystyle f\in F.} [ 5 ] Theorem [ 2 ] [ 5 ] — The G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} -topology on F {\displaystyle F} is compatible with the vector space structure of F {\displaystyle F} if and only if every G ∈ ∈ G {\displaystyle G\in {\mathcal {G}}} is F {\displaystyle F} -bounded; 
that is, if and only if for every G ∈ ∈ G {\displaystyle G\in {\mathcal {G}}} and every f ∈ ∈ F , {\displaystyle f\in F,} f ( G ) {\displaystyle f(G)} is bounded in Y .

{\displaystyle Y.} Properties Properties of the basic open sets will now be described, so assume that G ∈ ∈ G {\displaystyle G\in {\mathcal {G}}} and N ∈ ∈ N .

{\displaystyle N\in {\mathcal {N}}.} Then U ( G , N ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {U}}(G,N)} is an absorbing subset of F {\displaystyle F} if and only if for all f ∈ ∈ F , {\displaystyle f\in F,} N {\displaystyle N} absorbs f ( G ) {\displaystyle f(G)} .

[ 6 ] If N {\displaystyle N} is balanced [ 6 ] (respectively, convex ) then so is U ( G , N ) .

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {U}}(G,N).} The equality U ( ∅ ∅ , N ) = F {\displaystyle {\mathcal {U}}(\varnothing ,N)=F} always holds. 
If s {\displaystyle s} is a scalar then s U ( G , N ) = U ( G , s N ) , {\displaystyle s{\mathcal {U}}(G,N)={\mathcal {U}}(G,sN),} so that in particular, − − U ( G , N ) = U ( G , − − N ) .

{\displaystyle -{\mathcal {U}}(G,N)={\mathcal {U}}(G,-N).} [ 6 ] Moreover, [ 4 ] U ( G , N ) − − U ( G , N ) ⊆ ⊆ U ( G , N − − N ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {U}}(G,N)-{\mathcal {U}}(G,N)\subseteq {\mathcal {U}}(G,N-N)} and similarly [ 5 ] U ( G , M ) + U ( G , N ) ⊆ ⊆ U ( G , M + N ) .

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {U}}(G,M)+{\mathcal {U}}(G,N)\subseteq {\mathcal {U}}(G,M+N).} For any subsets G , H ⊆ ⊆ X {\displaystyle G,H\subseteq X} and any non-empty subsets M , N ⊆ ⊆ Y , {\displaystyle M,N\subseteq Y,} [ 5 ] U ( G ∪ ∪ H , M ∩ ∩ N ) ⊆ ⊆ U ( G , M ) ∩ ∩ U ( H , N ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {U}}(G\cup H,M\cap N)\subseteq {\mathcal {U}}(G,M)\cap {\mathcal {U}}(H,N)} which implies: if M ⊆ ⊆ N {\displaystyle M\subseteq N} then U ( G , M ) ⊆ ⊆ U ( G , N ) .

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {U}}(G,M)\subseteq {\mathcal {U}}(G,N).} [ 6 ] if G ⊆ ⊆ H {\displaystyle G\subseteq H} then U ( H , N ) ⊆ ⊆ U ( G , N ) .

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {U}}(H,N)\subseteq {\mathcal {U}}(G,N).} For any M , N ∈ ∈ N {\displaystyle M,N\in {\mathcal {N}}} and subsets G , H , K {\displaystyle G,H,K} of T , {\displaystyle T,} if G ∪ ∪ H ⊆ ⊆ K {\displaystyle G\cup H\subseteq K} then U ( K , M ∩ ∩ N ) ⊆ ⊆ U ( G , M ) ∩ ∩ U ( H , N ) .

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {U}}(K,M\cap N)\subseteq {\mathcal {U}}(G,M)\cap {\mathcal {U}}(H,N).} For any family S {\displaystyle {\mathcal {S}}} of subsets of T {\displaystyle T} and any family M {\displaystyle {\mathcal {M}}} of neighborhoods of the origin in Y , {\displaystyle Y,} [ 4 ] U ( ⋃ ⋃ S ∈ ∈ S S , N ) = ⋂ ⋂ S ∈ ∈ S U ( S , N ) and U ( G , ⋂ ⋂ M ∈ ∈ M M ) = ⋂ ⋂ M ∈ ∈ M U ( G , M ) .

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {U}}\left(\bigcup _{S\in {\mathcal {S}}}S,N\right)=\bigcap _{S\in {\mathcal {S}}}{\mathcal {U}}(S,N)\qquad {\text{ and }}\qquad {\mathcal {U}}\left(G,\bigcap _{M\in {\mathcal {M}}}M\right)=\bigcap _{M\in {\mathcal {M}}}{\mathcal {U}}(G,M).} Uniform structure [ edit ] See also: Uniform space For any G ⊆ ⊆ T {\displaystyle G\subseteq T} and U ⊆ ⊆ Y × × Y {\displaystyle U\subseteq Y\times Y} be any entourage of Y {\displaystyle Y} (where Y {\displaystyle Y} is endowed with its canonical uniformity ), let W ( G , U ) := { ( u , v ) ∈ ∈ Y T × × Y T : ( u ( g ) , v ( g ) ) ∈ ∈ U for every g ∈ ∈ G } .

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {W}}(G,U)~:=~\left\{(u,v)\in Y^{T}\times Y^{T}~:~(u(g),v(g))\in U\;{\text{ for every }}g\in G\right\}.} Given G ⊆ ⊆ T , {\displaystyle G\subseteq T,} the family of all sets W ( G , U ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {W}}(G,U)} as U {\displaystyle U} ranges over any fundamental system of entourages of Y {\displaystyle Y} forms a fundamental system of entourages for a uniform structure on Y T {\displaystyle Y^{T}} called the uniformity of uniform converges on G {\displaystyle G} or simply the G {\displaystyle G} -convergence uniform structure .

[ 7 ] The G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} -convergence uniform structure is the least upper bound of all G {\displaystyle G} -convergence uniform structures as G ∈ ∈ G {\displaystyle G\in {\mathcal {G}}} ranges over G .

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}.} [ 7 ] Nets and uniform convergence Let f ∈ ∈ F {\displaystyle f\in F} and let f ∙ ∙ = ( f i ) i ∈ ∈ I {\displaystyle f_{\bullet }=\left(f_{i}\right)_{i\in I}} be a net in F .

{\displaystyle F.} Then for any subset G {\displaystyle G} of T , {\displaystyle T,} say that f ∙ ∙ {\displaystyle f_{\bullet }} converges uniformly to f {\displaystyle f} on G {\displaystyle G} if for every N ∈ ∈ N {\displaystyle N\in {\mathcal {N}}} there exists some i 0 ∈ ∈ I {\displaystyle i_{0}\in I} such that for every i ∈ ∈ I {\displaystyle i\in I} satisfying i ≥ ≥ i 0 , I {\displaystyle i\geq i_{0},I} f i − − f ∈ ∈ U ( G , N ) {\displaystyle f_{i}-f\in {\mathcal {U}}(G,N)} (or equivalently, f i ( g ) − − f ( g ) ∈ ∈ N {\displaystyle f_{i}(g)-f(g)\in N} for every g ∈ ∈ G {\displaystyle g\in G} ).

[ 5 ] Theorem [ 5 ] — If f ∈ ∈ F {\displaystyle f\in F} and if f ∙ ∙ = ( f i ) i ∈ ∈ I {\displaystyle f_{\bullet }=\left(f_{i}\right)_{i\in I}} is a net in F , {\displaystyle F,} then f ∙ ∙ → → f {\displaystyle f_{\bullet }\to f} in the G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} -topology on F {\displaystyle F} if and only if for every G ∈ ∈ G , {\displaystyle G\in {\mathcal {G}},} f ∙ ∙ {\displaystyle f_{\bullet }} converges uniformly to f {\displaystyle f} on G .

{\displaystyle G.} Inherited properties [ edit ] Local convexity If Y {\displaystyle Y} is locally convex then so is the G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} -topology on F {\displaystyle F} and if ( p i ) i ∈ ∈ I {\displaystyle \left(p_{i}\right)_{i\in I}} is a family of continuous seminorms generating this topology on Y {\displaystyle Y} then the G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} -topology is induced by the following family of seminorms: p G , i ( f ) := sup x ∈ ∈ G p i ( f ( x ) ) , {\displaystyle p_{G,i}(f):=\sup _{x\in G}p_{i}(f(x)),} as G {\displaystyle G} varies over G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} and i {\displaystyle i} varies over I {\displaystyle I} .

[ 8 ] Hausdorffness If Y {\displaystyle Y} is Hausdorff and T = ⋃ ⋃ G ∈ ∈ G G {\displaystyle T=\bigcup _{G\in {\mathcal {G}}}G} then the G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} -topology on F {\displaystyle F} is Hausdorff.

[ 5 ] Suppose that T {\displaystyle T} is a topological space. 
If Y {\displaystyle Y} is Hausdorff and F {\displaystyle F} is the vector subspace of Y T {\displaystyle Y^{T}} consisting of all continuous maps that are bounded on every G ∈ ∈ G {\displaystyle G\in {\mathcal {G}}} and if ⋃ ⋃ G ∈ ∈ G G {\displaystyle \bigcup _{G\in {\mathcal {G}}}G} is dense in T {\displaystyle T} then the G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} -topology on F {\displaystyle F} is Hausdorff.

Boundedness A subset H {\displaystyle H} of F {\displaystyle F} is bounded in the G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} -topology if and only if for every G ∈ ∈ G , {\displaystyle G\in {\mathcal {G}},} H ( G ) = ⋃ ⋃ h ∈ ∈ H h ( G ) {\displaystyle H(G)=\bigcup _{h\in H}h(G)} is bounded in Y .

{\displaystyle Y.} [ 8 ] Examples of 𝒢-topologies [ edit ] Pointwise convergence If we let G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} be the set of all finite subsets of T {\displaystyle T} then the G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} -topology on F {\displaystyle F} is called the topology of pointwise convergence . 
The topology of pointwise convergence on F {\displaystyle F} is identical to the subspace topology that F {\displaystyle F} inherits from Y T {\displaystyle Y^{T}} when Y T {\displaystyle Y^{T}} is endowed with the usual product topology .

If X {\displaystyle X} is a non-trivial completely regular Hausdorff topological space and C ( X ) {\displaystyle C(X)} is the space of all real (or complex) valued continuous functions on X , {\displaystyle X,} the topology of pointwise convergence on C ( X ) {\displaystyle C(X)} is metrizable if and only if X {\displaystyle X} is countable.

[ 5 ] 𝒢-topologies on spaces of continuous linear maps [ edit ] Throughout this section we will assume that X {\displaystyle X} and Y {\displaystyle Y} are topological vector spaces .

G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} will be a non-empty collection of subsets of X {\displaystyle X} directed by inclusion.

L ( X ; Y ) {\displaystyle L(X;Y)} will denote the vector space of all continuous linear maps from X {\displaystyle X} into Y .

{\displaystyle Y.} If L ( X ; Y ) {\displaystyle L(X;Y)} is given the G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} -topology inherited from Y X {\displaystyle Y^{X}} then this space with this topology is denoted by L G ( X ; Y ) {\displaystyle L_{\mathcal {G}}(X;Y)} .
The continuous dual space of a topological vector space X {\displaystyle X} over the field F {\displaystyle \mathbb {F} } (which we will assume to be real or complex numbers ) is the vector space L ( X ; F ) {\displaystyle L(X;\mathbb {F} )} and is denoted by X ′ ′ {\displaystyle X^{\prime }} .

The G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} -topology on L ( X ; Y ) {\displaystyle L(X;Y)} is compatible with the vector space structure of L ( X ; Y ) {\displaystyle L(X;Y)} if and only if for all G ∈ ∈ G {\displaystyle G\in {\mathcal {G}}} and all f ∈ ∈ L ( X ; Y ) {\displaystyle f\in L(X;Y)} the set f ( G ) {\displaystyle f(G)} is bounded in Y , {\displaystyle Y,} which we will assume to be the case for the rest of the article. 
Note in particular that this is the case if G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} consists of (von-Neumann) bounded subsets of X .

{\displaystyle X.} Assumptions on 𝒢 [ edit ] Assumptions that guarantee a vector topology ( G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} is directed): G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} will be a non-empty collection of subsets of X {\displaystyle X} directed by (subset) inclusion. That is, for any G , H ∈ ∈ G , {\displaystyle G,H\in {\mathcal {G}},} there exists K ∈ ∈ G {\displaystyle K\in {\mathcal {G}}} such that G ∪ ∪ H ⊆ ⊆ K {\displaystyle G\cup H\subseteq K} .

The above assumption guarantees that the collection of sets U ( G , N ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {U}}(G,N)} forms a filter base . 
The next assumption will guarantee that the sets U ( G , N ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {U}}(G,N)} are balanced . 
Every TVS has a neighborhood basis at 0 consisting of balanced sets so this assumption isn't burdensome.

( N ∈ ∈ N {\displaystyle N\in {\mathcal {N}}} are balanced): N {\displaystyle {\mathcal {N}}} is a neighborhoods basis of the origin in Y {\displaystyle Y} that consists entirely of balanced sets.

The following assumption is very commonly made because it will guarantee that each set U ( G , N ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {U}}(G,N)} is absorbing in L ( X ; Y ) .

{\displaystyle L(X;Y).} ( G ∈ ∈ G {\displaystyle G\in {\mathcal {G}}} are bounded): G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} is assumed to consist entirely of bounded subsets of X .

{\displaystyle X.} The next theorem gives ways in which G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} can be modified without changing the resulting G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} -topology on Y .

{\displaystyle Y.} Theorem [ 6 ] — Let G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} be a non-empty collection of bounded subsets of X .

{\displaystyle X.} Then the G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} -topology on L ( X ; Y ) {\displaystyle L(X;Y)} is not altered if G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} is replaced by any of the following collections of (also bounded) subsets of X {\displaystyle X} : all subsets of all finite unions of sets in G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} ; all scalar multiples of all sets in G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} ; all finite Minkowski sums of sets in G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} ; the balanced hull of every set in G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} ; the closure of every set in G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} ; and if X {\displaystyle X} and Y {\displaystyle Y} are locally convex, then we may add to this list: the closed convex balanced hull of every set in G .

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}.} Common assumptions Some authors (e.g. Narici) require that G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} satisfy the following condition, which implies, in particular, that G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} is directed by subset inclusion: G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} is assumed to be closed with respect to the formation of subsets of finite unions of sets in G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} (i.e. every subset of every finite union of sets in G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} belongs to G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} ).

Some authors (e.g. Trèves [ 9 ] ) require that G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} be directed under subset inclusion and that it satisfy the following condition: If G ∈ ∈ G {\displaystyle G\in {\mathcal {G}}} and s {\displaystyle s} is a scalar then there exists a H ∈ ∈ G {\displaystyle H\in {\mathcal {G}}} such that s G ⊆ ⊆ H .

{\displaystyle sG\subseteq H.} If G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} is a bornology on X , {\displaystyle X,} which is often the case, then these axioms are satisfied. 
If G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} is a saturated family of bounded subsets of X {\displaystyle X} then these axioms are also satisfied.

Properties [ edit ] Hausdorffness A subset of a TVS X {\displaystyle X} whose linear span is a dense subset of X {\displaystyle X} is said to be a total subset of X .

{\displaystyle X.} If G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} is a family of subsets of a TVS T {\displaystyle T} then G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} is said to be total in T {\displaystyle T} if the linear span of ⋃ ⋃ G ∈ ∈ G G {\displaystyle \bigcup _{G\in {\mathcal {G}}}G} is dense in T .

{\displaystyle T.} [ 10 ] If F {\displaystyle F} is the vector subspace of Y T {\displaystyle Y^{T}} consisting of all continuous linear maps that are bounded on every G ∈ ∈ G , {\displaystyle G\in {\mathcal {G}},} then the G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} -topology on F {\displaystyle F} is Hausdorff if Y {\displaystyle Y} is Hausdorff and G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} is total in T .

{\displaystyle T.} [ 6 ] Completeness For the following theorems, suppose that X {\displaystyle X} is a topological vector space and Y {\displaystyle Y} is a locally convex Hausdorff spaces and G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} is a collection of bounded subsets of X {\displaystyle X} that covers X , {\displaystyle X,} is directed by subset inclusion, and satisfies the following condition: if G ∈ ∈ G {\displaystyle G\in {\mathcal {G}}} and s {\displaystyle s} is a scalar then there exists a H ∈ ∈ G {\displaystyle H\in {\mathcal {G}}} such that s G ⊆ ⊆ H .

{\displaystyle sG\subseteq H.} L G ( X ; Y ) {\displaystyle L_{\mathcal {G}}(X;Y)} is complete if X {\displaystyle X} is locally convex and Hausdorff, Y {\displaystyle Y} is complete, and whenever u : X → → Y {\displaystyle u:X\to Y} is a linear map then u {\displaystyle u} restricted to every set G ∈ ∈ G {\displaystyle G\in {\mathcal {G}}} is continuous implies that u {\displaystyle u} is continuous, If X {\displaystyle X} is a Mackey space then L G ( X ; Y ) {\displaystyle L_{\mathcal {G}}(X;Y)} is complete if and only if both X G ′ ′ {\displaystyle X_{\mathcal {G}}^{\prime }} and Y {\displaystyle Y} are complete.

If X {\displaystyle X} is barrelled then L G ( X ; Y ) {\displaystyle L_{\mathcal {G}}(X;Y)} is Hausdorff and quasi-complete .

Let X {\displaystyle X} and Y {\displaystyle Y} be TVSs with Y {\displaystyle Y} quasi-complete and assume that (1) X {\displaystyle X} is barreled , or else (2) X {\displaystyle X} is a Baire space and X {\displaystyle X} and Y {\displaystyle Y} are locally convex. If G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} covers X {\displaystyle X} then every closed equicontinuous subset of L ( X ; Y ) {\displaystyle L(X;Y)} is complete in L G ( X ; Y ) {\displaystyle L_{\mathcal {G}}(X;Y)} and L G ( X ; Y ) {\displaystyle L_{\mathcal {G}}(X;Y)} is quasi-complete.

[ 11 ] Let X {\displaystyle X} be a bornological space , Y {\displaystyle Y} a locally convex space, and G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} a family of bounded subsets of X {\displaystyle X} such that the range of every null sequence in X {\displaystyle X} is contained in some G ∈ ∈ G .

{\displaystyle G\in {\mathcal {G}}.} If Y {\displaystyle Y} is quasi-complete (respectively, complete ) then so is L G ( X ; Y ) {\displaystyle L_{\mathcal {G}}(X;Y)} .

[ 12 ] Boundedness Let X {\displaystyle X} and Y {\displaystyle Y} be topological vector spaces and H {\displaystyle H} be a subset of L ( X ; Y ) .

{\displaystyle L(X;Y).} Then the following are equivalent: [ 8 ] H {\displaystyle H} is bounded in L G ( X ; Y ) {\displaystyle L_{\mathcal {G}}(X;Y)} ; For every G ∈ ∈ G , {\displaystyle G\in {\mathcal {G}},} H ( G ) := ⋃ ⋃ h ∈ ∈ H h ( G ) {\displaystyle H(G):=\bigcup _{h\in H}h(G)} is bounded in Y {\displaystyle Y} ; [ 8 ] For every neighborhood V {\displaystyle V} of the origin in Y {\displaystyle Y} the set ⋂ ⋂ h ∈ ∈ H h − − 1 ( V ) {\displaystyle \bigcap _{h\in H}h^{-1}(V)} absorbs every G ∈ ∈ G .

{\displaystyle G\in {\mathcal {G}}.} If G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} is a collection of bounded subsets of X {\displaystyle X} whose union is total in X {\displaystyle X} then every equicontinuous subset of L ( X ; Y ) {\displaystyle L(X;Y)} is bounded in the G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} -topology.

[ 11 ] Furthermore, if X {\displaystyle X} and Y {\displaystyle Y} are locally convex Hausdorff spaces then if H {\displaystyle H} is bounded in L σ σ ( X ; Y ) {\displaystyle L_{\sigma }(X;Y)} (that is, pointwise bounded or simply bounded) then it is bounded in the topology of uniform convergence on the convex, balanced, bounded, complete subsets of X .

{\displaystyle X.} [ 13 ] if X {\displaystyle X} is quasi-complete (meaning that closed and bounded subsets are complete), then the bounded subsets of L ( X ; Y ) {\displaystyle L(X;Y)} are identical for all G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} -topologies where G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} is any family of bounded subsets of X {\displaystyle X} covering X .

{\displaystyle X.} [ 13 ] Examples [ edit ] G ⊆ ⊆ ℘ ℘ ( X ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}\subseteq \wp (X)} ("topology of uniform convergence on ...") Notation Name ("topology of...") Alternative name finite subsets of X {\displaystyle X} L σ σ ( X ; Y ) {\displaystyle L_{\sigma }(X;Y)} pointwise/simple convergence topology of simple convergence precompact subsets of X {\displaystyle X} precompact convergence compact convex subsets of X {\displaystyle X} L γ γ ( X ; Y ) {\displaystyle L_{\gamma }(X;Y)} compact convex convergence compact subsets of X {\displaystyle X} L c ( X ; Y ) {\displaystyle L_{c}(X;Y)} compact convergence bounded subsets of X {\displaystyle X} L b ( X ; Y ) {\displaystyle L_{b}(X;Y)} bounded convergence strong topology The topology of pointwise convergence [ edit ] By letting G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} be the set of all finite subsets of X , {\displaystyle X,} L ( X ; Y ) {\displaystyle L(X;Y)} will have the weak topology on L ( X ; Y ) {\displaystyle L(X;Y)} or the topology of pointwise convergence or the topology of simple convergence and L ( X ; Y ) {\displaystyle L(X;Y)} with this topology is denoted by L σ σ ( X ; Y ) {\displaystyle L_{\sigma }(X;Y)} . 
Unfortunately, this topology is also sometimes called the strong operator topology , which may lead to ambiguity; [ 6 ] for this reason, this article will avoid referring to this topology by this name.

A subset of L ( X ; Y ) {\displaystyle L(X;Y)} is called simply bounded or weakly bounded if it is bounded in L σ σ ( X ; Y ) {\displaystyle L_{\sigma }(X;Y)} .

The weak-topology on L ( X ; Y ) {\displaystyle L(X;Y)} has the following properties: If X {\displaystyle X} is separable (that is, it has a countable dense subset) and if Y {\displaystyle Y} is a metrizable topological vector space then every equicontinuous subset H {\displaystyle H} of L σ σ ( X ; Y ) {\displaystyle L_{\sigma }(X;Y)} is metrizable; if in addition Y {\displaystyle Y} is separable then so is H .

{\displaystyle H.} [ 14 ] So in particular, on every equicontinuous subset of L ( X ; Y ) , {\displaystyle L(X;Y),} the topology of pointwise convergence is metrizable.

Let Y X {\displaystyle Y^{X}} denote the space of all functions from X {\displaystyle X} into Y .

{\displaystyle Y.} If L ( X ; Y ) {\displaystyle L(X;Y)} is given the topology of pointwise convergence then space of all linear maps (continuous or not) X {\displaystyle X} into Y {\displaystyle Y} is closed in Y X {\displaystyle Y^{X}} .

In addition, L ( X ; Y ) {\displaystyle L(X;Y)} is dense in the space of all linear maps (continuous or not) X {\displaystyle X} into Y .

{\displaystyle Y.} Suppose X {\displaystyle X} and Y {\displaystyle Y} are locally convex. Any simply bounded subset of L ( X ; Y ) {\displaystyle L(X;Y)} is bounded when L ( X ; Y ) {\displaystyle L(X;Y)} has the topology of uniform convergence on convex, balanced , bounded, complete subsets of X .

{\displaystyle X.} If in addition X {\displaystyle X} is quasi-complete then the families of bounded subsets of L ( X ; Y ) {\displaystyle L(X;Y)} are identical for all G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} -topologies on L ( X ; Y ) {\displaystyle L(X;Y)} such that G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} is a family of bounded sets covering X .

{\displaystyle X.} [ 13 ] Equicontinuous subsets The weak-closure of an equicontinuous subset of L ( X ; Y ) {\displaystyle L(X;Y)} is equicontinuous.

If Y {\displaystyle Y} is locally convex, then the convex balanced hull of an equicontinuous subset of L ( X ; Y ) {\displaystyle L(X;Y)} is equicontinuous.

Let X {\displaystyle X} and Y {\displaystyle Y} be TVSs and assume that (1) X {\displaystyle X} is barreled , or else (2) X {\displaystyle X} is a Baire space and X {\displaystyle X} and Y {\displaystyle Y} are locally convex. Then every simply bounded subset of L ( X ; Y ) {\displaystyle L(X;Y)} is equicontinuous.

[ 11 ] On an equicontinuous subset H {\displaystyle H} of L ( X ; Y ) , {\displaystyle L(X;Y),} the following topologies are identical: (1) topology of pointwise convergence on a total subset of X {\displaystyle X} ; (2) the topology of pointwise convergence; (3) the topology of precompact convergence.

[ 11 ] Compact convergence [ edit ] By letting G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} be the set of all compact subsets of X , {\displaystyle X,} L ( X ; Y ) {\displaystyle L(X;Y)} will have the topology of compact convergence or the topology of uniform convergence on compact sets and L ( X ; Y ) {\displaystyle L(X;Y)} with this topology is denoted by L c ( X ; Y ) {\displaystyle L_{c}(X;Y)} .

The topology of compact convergence on L ( X ; Y ) {\displaystyle L(X;Y)} has the following properties: If X {\displaystyle X} is a Fréchet space or a LF-space and if Y {\displaystyle Y} is a complete locally convex Hausdorff space then L c ( X ; Y ) {\displaystyle L_{c}(X;Y)} is complete.

On equicontinuous subsets of L ( X ; Y ) , {\displaystyle L(X;Y),} the following topologies coincide: The topology of pointwise convergence on a dense subset of X , {\displaystyle X,} The topology of pointwise convergence on X , {\displaystyle X,} The topology of compact convergence.

The topology of precompact convergence.

If X {\displaystyle X} is a Montel space and Y {\displaystyle Y} is a topological vector space, then L c ( X ; Y ) {\displaystyle L_{c}(X;Y)} and L b ( X ; Y ) {\displaystyle L_{b}(X;Y)} have identical topologies.

Topology of bounded convergence [ edit ] By letting G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} be the set of all bounded subsets of X , {\displaystyle X,} L ( X ; Y ) {\displaystyle L(X;Y)} will have the topology of bounded convergence on X {\displaystyle X} or the topology of uniform convergence on bounded sets and L ( X ; Y ) {\displaystyle L(X;Y)} with this topology is denoted by L b ( X ; Y ) {\displaystyle L_{b}(X;Y)} .

[ 6 ] The topology of bounded convergence on L ( X ; Y ) {\displaystyle L(X;Y)} has the following properties: If X {\displaystyle X} is a bornological space and if Y {\displaystyle Y} is a complete locally convex Hausdorff space then L b ( X ; Y ) {\displaystyle L_{b}(X;Y)} is complete.

If X {\displaystyle X} and Y {\displaystyle Y} are both normed spaces then the topology on L ( X ; Y ) {\displaystyle L(X;Y)} induced by the usual operator norm is identical to the topology on L b ( X ; Y ) {\displaystyle L_{b}(X;Y)} .

[ 6 ] In particular, if X {\displaystyle X} is a normed space then the usual norm topology on the continuous dual space X ′ ′ {\displaystyle X^{\prime }} is identical to the topology of bounded convergence on X ′ ′ {\displaystyle X^{\prime }} .

Every equicontinuous subset of L ( X ; Y ) {\displaystyle L(X;Y)} is bounded in L b ( X ; Y ) {\displaystyle L_{b}(X;Y)} .

Polar topologies [ edit ] Main article: Polar topology Throughout, we assume that X {\displaystyle X} is a TVS.

𝒢-topologies versus polar topologies [ edit ] If X {\displaystyle X} is a TVS whose bounded subsets are exactly the same as its weakly bounded subsets (e.g. if X {\displaystyle X} is a Hausdorff locally convex space), then a G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} -topology on X ′ ′ {\displaystyle X^{\prime }} (as defined in this article) is a polar topology and conversely, every polar topology if a G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} -topology. 
Consequently, in this case the results mentioned in this article can be applied to polar topologies.

However, if X {\displaystyle X} is a TVS whose bounded subsets are not exactly the same as its weakly bounded subsets, then the notion of "bounded in X {\displaystyle X} " is stronger than the notion of " σ σ ( X , X ′ ′ ) {\displaystyle \sigma \left(X,X^{\prime }\right)} -bounded in X {\displaystyle X} " (i.e. bounded in X {\displaystyle X} implies σ σ ( X , X ′ ′ ) {\displaystyle \sigma \left(X,X^{\prime }\right)} -bounded in X {\displaystyle X} ) so that a G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} -topology on X ′ ′ {\displaystyle X^{\prime }} (as defined in this article) is not necessarily a polar topology. 
One important difference is that polar topologies are always locally convex while G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} -topologies need not be.

Polar topologies have stronger results than the more general topologies of uniform convergence described in this article and we refer the read to the main article: polar topology . 
We list here some of the most common polar topologies.

List of polar topologies [ edit ] Suppose that X {\displaystyle X} is a TVS whose bounded subsets are the same as its weakly bounded subsets.

Notation : If Δ Δ ( Y , X ) {\displaystyle \Delta (Y,X)} denotes a polar topology on Y {\displaystyle Y} then Y {\displaystyle Y} endowed with this topology will be denoted by Y Δ Δ ( Y , X ) {\displaystyle Y_{\Delta (Y,X)}} or simply Y Δ Δ {\displaystyle Y_{\Delta }} (e.g. for σ σ ( Y , X ) {\displaystyle \sigma (Y,X)} we would have Δ Δ = σ σ {\displaystyle \Delta =\sigma } so that Y σ σ ( Y , X ) {\displaystyle Y_{\sigma (Y,X)}} and Y σ σ {\displaystyle Y_{\sigma }} all denote Y {\displaystyle Y} with endowed with σ σ ( Y , X ) {\displaystyle \sigma (Y,X)} ).

Alternative name finite subsets of X {\displaystyle X} σ σ ( Y , X ) {\displaystyle \sigma (Y,X)} s ( Y , X ) {\displaystyle s(Y,X)} pointwise/simple convergence weak/weak* topology σ σ ( X , Y ) {\displaystyle \sigma (X,Y)} -compact disks τ τ ( Y , X ) {\displaystyle \tau (Y,X)} Mackey topology σ σ ( X , Y ) {\displaystyle \sigma (X,Y)} -compact convex subsets γ γ ( Y , X ) {\displaystyle \gamma (Y,X)} compact convex convergence σ σ ( X , Y ) {\displaystyle \sigma (X,Y)} -compact subsets (or balanced σ σ ( X , Y ) {\displaystyle \sigma (X,Y)} -compact subsets) c ( Y , X ) {\displaystyle c(Y,X)} compact convergence σ σ ( X , Y ) {\displaystyle \sigma (X,Y)} -bounded subsets b ( Y , X ) {\displaystyle b(Y,X)} β β ( Y , X ) {\displaystyle \beta (Y,X)} bounded convergence strong topology 𝒢-ℋ topologies on spaces of bilinear maps [ edit ] We will let B ( X , Y ; Z ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}(X,Y;Z)} denote the space of separately continuous bilinear maps and B ( X , Y ; Z ) {\displaystyle B(X,Y;Z)} denote the space of continuous bilinear maps, where X , Y , {\displaystyle X,Y,} and Z {\displaystyle Z} are topological vector space over the same field (either the real or complex numbers). 
In an analogous way to how we placed a topology on L ( X ; Y ) {\displaystyle L(X;Y)} we can place a topology on B ( X , Y ; Z ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}(X,Y;Z)} and B ( X , Y ; Z ) {\displaystyle B(X,Y;Z)} .

Let G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} (respectively, H {\displaystyle {\mathcal {H}}} ) be a family of subsets of X {\displaystyle X} (respectively, Y {\displaystyle Y} ) containing at least one non-empty set. 
Let G × × H {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}\times {\mathcal {H}}} denote the collection of all sets G × × H {\displaystyle G\times H} where G ∈ ∈ G , {\displaystyle G\in {\mathcal {G}},} H ∈ ∈ H .

{\displaystyle H\in {\mathcal {H}}.} We can place on Z X × × Y {\displaystyle Z^{X\times Y}} the G × × H {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}\times {\mathcal {H}}} -topology, and consequently on any of its subsets, in particular on B ( X , Y ; Z ) {\displaystyle B(X,Y;Z)} and on B ( X , Y ; Z ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}(X,Y;Z)} . 
This topology is known as the G − − H {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}-{\mathcal {H}}} -topology or as the topology of uniform convergence on the products G × × H {\displaystyle G\times H} of G × × H {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}\times {\mathcal {H}}} .

However, as before, this topology is not necessarily compatible with the vector space structure of B ( X , Y ; Z ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}(X,Y;Z)} or of B ( X , Y ; Z ) {\displaystyle B(X,Y;Z)} without the additional requirement that for all bilinear maps, b {\displaystyle b} in this space (that is, in B ( X , Y ; Z ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}(X,Y;Z)} or in B ( X , Y ; Z ) {\displaystyle B(X,Y;Z)} ) and for all G ∈ ∈ G {\displaystyle G\in {\mathcal {G}}} and H ∈ ∈ H , {\displaystyle H\in {\mathcal {H}},} the set b ( G , H ) {\displaystyle b(G,H)} is bounded in X .

{\displaystyle X.} If both G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} and H {\displaystyle {\mathcal {H}}} consist of bounded sets then this requirement is automatically satisfied if we are topologizing B ( X , Y ; Z ) {\displaystyle B(X,Y;Z)} but this may not be the case if we are trying to topologize B ( X , Y ; Z ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}(X,Y;Z)} . 
The G − − H {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}-{\mathcal {H}}} -topology on B ( X , Y ; Z ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}(X,Y;Z)} will be compatible with the vector space structure of B ( X , Y ; Z ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}(X,Y;Z)} if both G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} and H {\displaystyle {\mathcal {H}}} consists of bounded sets and any of the following conditions hold: X {\displaystyle X} and Y {\displaystyle Y} are barrelled spaces and Z {\displaystyle Z} is locally convex.

X {\displaystyle X} is a F-space , Y {\displaystyle Y} is metrizable, and Z {\displaystyle Z} is Hausdorff, in which case B ( X , Y ; Z ) = B ( X , Y ; Z ) .

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}(X,Y;Z)=B(X,Y;Z).} X , Y , {\displaystyle X,Y,} and Z {\displaystyle Z} are the strong duals of reflexive Fréchet spaces.

X {\displaystyle X} is normed and Y {\displaystyle Y} and Z {\displaystyle Z} the strong duals of reflexive Fréchet spaces.

The ε-topology [ edit ] Main article: Injective tensor product Suppose that X , Y , {\displaystyle X,Y,} and Z {\displaystyle Z} are locally convex spaces and let G ′ ′ {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}^{\prime }} and H ′ ′ {\displaystyle {\mathcal {H}}^{\prime }} be the collections of equicontinuous subsets of X ′ ′ {\displaystyle X^{\prime }} and X ′ ′ {\displaystyle X^{\prime }} , respectively. 
Then the G ′ ′ − − H ′ ′ {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}^{\prime }-{\mathcal {H}}^{\prime }} -topology on B ( X b ( X ′ ′ , X ) ′ ′ , Y b ( X ′ ′ , X ) ′ ′ ; Z ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}\left(X_{b\left(X^{\prime },X\right)}^{\prime },Y_{b\left(X^{\prime },X\right)}^{\prime };Z\right)} will be a topological vector space topology. 
This topology is called the ε-topology and B ( X b ( X ′ ′ , X ) ′ ′ , Y b ( X ′ ′ , X ) ; Z ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}\left(X_{b\left(X^{\prime },X\right)}^{\prime },Y_{b\left(X^{\prime },X\right)};Z\right)} with this topology it is denoted by B ϵ ϵ ( X b ( X ′ ′ , X ) ′ ′ , Y b ( X ′ ′ , X ) ′ ′ ; Z ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}_{\epsilon }\left(X_{b\left(X^{\prime },X\right)}^{\prime },Y_{b\left(X^{\prime },X\right)}^{\prime };Z\right)} or simply by B ϵ ϵ ( X b ′ ′ , Y b ′ ′ ; Z ) .

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}_{\epsilon }\left(X_{b}^{\prime },Y_{b}^{\prime };Z\right).} Part of the importance of this vector space and this topology is that it contains many subspace, such as B ( X σ σ ( X ′ ′ , X ) ′ ′ , Y σ σ ( X ′ ′ , X ) ′ ′ ; Z ) , {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}\left(X_{\sigma \left(X^{\prime },X\right)}^{\prime },Y_{\sigma \left(X^{\prime },X\right)}^{\prime };Z\right),} which we denote by B ( X σ σ ′ ′ , Y σ σ ′ ′ ; Z ) .

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}\left(X_{\sigma }^{\prime },Y_{\sigma }^{\prime };Z\right).} When this subspace is given the subspace topology of B ϵ ϵ ( X b ′ ′ , Y b ′ ′ ; Z ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}_{\epsilon }\left(X_{b}^{\prime },Y_{b}^{\prime };Z\right)} it is denoted by B ϵ ϵ ( X σ σ ′ ′ , Y σ σ ′ ′ ; Z ) .

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}_{\epsilon }\left(X_{\sigma }^{\prime },Y_{\sigma }^{\prime };Z\right).} In the instance where Z {\displaystyle Z} is the field of these vector spaces, B ( X σ σ ′ ′ , Y σ σ ′ ′ ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}\left(X_{\sigma }^{\prime },Y_{\sigma }^{\prime }\right)} is a tensor product of X {\displaystyle X} and Y .

{\displaystyle Y.} In fact, if X {\displaystyle X} and Y {\displaystyle Y} are locally convex Hausdorff spaces then B ( X σ σ ′ ′ , Y σ σ ′ ′ ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}\left(X_{\sigma }^{\prime },Y_{\sigma }^{\prime }\right)} is vector space-isomorphic to L ( X σ σ ( X ′ ′ , X ) ′ ′ ; Y σ σ ( Y ′ ′ , Y ) ) , {\displaystyle L\left(X_{\sigma \left(X^{\prime },X\right)}^{\prime };Y_{\sigma (Y^{\prime },Y)}\right),} which is in turn is equal to L ( X τ τ ( X ′ ′ , X ) ′ ′ ; Y ) .

{\displaystyle L\left(X_{\tau \left(X^{\prime },X\right)}^{\prime };Y\right).} These spaces have the following properties: If X {\displaystyle X} and Y {\displaystyle Y} are locally convex Hausdorff spaces then B ε ε ( X σ σ ′ ′ , Y σ σ ′ ′ ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}_{\varepsilon }\left(X_{\sigma }^{\prime },Y_{\sigma }^{\prime }\right)} is complete if and only if both X {\displaystyle X} and Y {\displaystyle Y} are complete.

If X {\displaystyle X} and Y {\displaystyle Y} are both normed (respectively, both Banach) then so is B ϵ ϵ ( X σ σ ′ ′ , Y σ σ ′ ′ ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}_{\epsilon }\left(X_{\sigma }^{\prime },Y_{\sigma }^{\prime }\right)} See also [ edit ] Bornological space – Space where bounded operators are continuous Bounded linear operator Dual system – Dual pair of vector spaces Dual topology List of topologies – List of concrete topologies and topological spaces Modes of convergence – Property of a sequence or series Operator norm – Measure of the "size" of linear operators Polar topology – Dual space topology of uniform convergence on some sub-collection of bounded subsets Strong dual space – Continuous dual space endowed with the topology of uniform convergence on bounded sets Topologies on the set of operators on a Hilbert space Uniform convergence – Mode of convergence of a function sequence Uniform space – Topological space with a notion of uniform properties Weak topology – Mathematical term Vague topology References [ edit ] ^ Because T {\displaystyle T} is just a set that is not yet assumed to be endowed with any vector space structure, F ⊆ ⊆ Y T {\displaystyle F\subseteq Y^{T}} should not yet be assumed to consist of linear maps, which is a notation that currently can not be defined.

^ Note that each set U ( G , N ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {U}}(G,N)} is a neighborhood of the origin for this topology, but it is not necessarily an open neighborhood of the origin.

^ In practice, G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} usually consists of a collection of sets with certain properties and this name is changed appropriately to reflect this set so that if, for instance, G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} is the collection of compact subsets of T {\displaystyle T} (and T {\displaystyle T} is a topological space), then this topology is called the topology of uniform convergence on the compact subsets of T .
