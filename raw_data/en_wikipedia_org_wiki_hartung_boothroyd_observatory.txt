Houck Telescope 60 cm (25") Fork-mounted Cassegrain reflector Location of Hartung–Boothroyd Observatory [ edit on Wikidata ] The Hartung–Boothroyd Observatory (HBO) is located atop Mount Pleasant near Cornell University outside of Ithaca, New York (US).

[ 1 ] It is used mainly as a teaching facility for upper-level undergraduate astronomy classes. The observatory is named to recognize funding from M. John Hartung , a 1908 Cornell graduate and later chemical industrialist, and to honor Samuel L. Boothroyd , the founder of Cornell's Department of Astronomy.  The facility was designed and directed from 1974 to 2012 by James R. Houck .

The primary 0.6m mirror was constructed from a Pyrex 1/8-scale test pouring as part of technology development for the Palomar Observatory 200-inch telescope.  The mirror was polished and mounted in a lightweight tube in the late 1930s under Boothroyd's direction, but World War II deferred its planned use in a high-altitude observatory.  This facility, together with an equatorial fork mount to hold the previously completed telescope, was completed in 1974.
