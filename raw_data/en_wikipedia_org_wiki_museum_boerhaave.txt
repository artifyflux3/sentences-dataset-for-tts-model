The museum hosts a collection of historical scientific instruments from all disciplines, but mainly from medicine , physics , and astronomy .

The museum is located in a building that was originally a convent in central Leiden. It includes a reconstructed traditional anatomical theatre . It also has many galleries that include the apparatus with which Heike Kamerlingh Onnes first liquefied helium (in Leiden), the electromagnet equipment used by Wander Johannes de Haas (a Leiden physicist) for his low-temperature research, and an example of the Leiden jar , among many other objects in the extensive collection.

The museum is named after Herman Boerhaave , a Dutch physician and botanist who was famous in Europe for his teaching at Leiden and lived to a great age, receiving brilliant students from all over Europe, including Peter the Great , Voltaire and Linnaeus .

History [ edit ] Boerhaave Museum's history began in 1907, when a Historical Exhibition of Natural Science and Medicine was held in the Academy Building [ nl ] of Leiden University . The many objects in the exhibition came from all the learned corners of the country. It was a great success and there were immediately calls to set up a permanent science history exhibit.

[ 4 ] In 1928 a foundation was initiated by physicist Claude August Crommelin , who worked at Leiden university, for a museum for the history of natural sciences. The aim of the museum was described in the preliminary statutes of the foundation: "the collection of instruments, tools, slides and specimens, documents and other objects, which are important for the history of the natural sciences; to look after these objects, describe them and keep them in a museum which is to be located in Leiden". The sciences to be represented included: Astronomy , Physics , Chemistry , Botany , Zoology , Pharmacy , all medical sciences – including Physiology , Anatomy et cetera, and Mathematics .

In 1931 the museum opened as "The Dutch Historical Museum of the Natural Sciences" ( Het Nederlandsch Historisch Natuurwetenschappelijk Museum ). To the view of Crommelin, the museum was to become a national museum: the 's Gravesande-Musschenbroek collection would form the starting point, to which collections from other institutes were to be added.

In 1947 the museum, which was in fact a private foundation, became formally a national museum . It was renamed to "The Dutch National Museum for the History of the Natural Sciences" ( Rijksmuseum voor de Geschiedenis van Natuurwetenschappen ). An advisory board was installed in which members of Dutch universities would take seat. It underlined the ambition to become a national museum, not a museum solely connected to the Leiden University.

Before moving in 1991, the museum was located in the former Boerhaave Laboratory at the Steenstraat 1, Leiden, a building which belonged to the Leiden Academic Hospital ( Leiden Academisch Hospital ), now part of LUMC, Leiden University Medical Center . This location of the museum now houses the National Museum of Ethnology .

To create better housing the former nunnery of Saint Cecilia was bought by the Government Buildings Agency ( Rijksgebouwendienst ). This historic building has had various functions over time. The building dates from the early 15th century. The building had become municipal property after the Protestant Reformation and shortly before 1600 was converted into a pest house and lunatic asylum . The Leiden Academic hospital was founded in this location between 1636 and 1639.

[ 5 ] In 1967, with the prospect of a new location the name of the museum was changed to "Museum Boerhaave". However, it took more than twenty years before the museum finally moved.

[ 6 ] After extensive restoration and expansion, the building is in use as a museum since 1991.

[ 7 ] Rijksmuseum Boerhaave was elected European Museum of the Year 2019. Founded in 1977, this is the oldest and most prestigious museum award in Europe. The international jury praised the completely renewed science and medicine museum in Leiden: "The exceptional public quality of this museum results from its artful approach to communicating science.  Important and beautiful objects are interpreted using the latest technologies and the personal stories of those driven by a passion for the pursuit of knowledge.  The result is science with a human face, inspiring curiosity and amazement as well as engaging a wide public in debates on important scientific and ethical questions issues of our time." [ 8 ] Collection [ edit ] The Boerhaave Museum is running a project [ 9 ] to document approx. 3000 objects in its collection online, with pictures and descriptions for every single object. In April 2010 the site featured over 1750 objects, ordered by room and showcase. This overview is in large part based on the museum's online documentation.

The museum has 25 galleries, which are by and large organised chronologically, [ 9 ] with thematical subgroupings per gallery.

16th–17th century [ edit ] 0 Museum Foyer [ 10 ] Gaper Gaper Gaper Gapers (wooden heads miming the swallowing of pills) and other shop signs for pharmacies and druggists . Also a 'dictionary of health': a tall book-shaped wooden chest (1660) filled with simples (basic substances used in medicine).

1 Leiden Anatomical Theater [ 11 ] Dissection of a roe deer during the 2nd Leiden Museum Night in the Anatomical Theatre by an animal taxidermist with assistants from Naturalis . The deer had died earlier in a road accident.

The anatomical theatre at Leiden University in the early 17th century Reconstruction of the anatomical theatre (1988) Skeletons around Anatomical Theatre Surgeons instrument chest used by the Leiden surgeons’ guild and decorated with the coats-of-arms of board members The room shows a reconstruction (1988) of the Theatrum Anatomicum ( anatomical theatre ) (built 1596). A richly decorated instrument chest (1670) which belonged to the Leiden surgeon 's guild . A small collection of objects (largely Egyptian antiquities) that survived from the now gone Leiden Theatrum (one of the oldest museums of Europe [ citation needed ] ) are shown as well. On the wall three paintings: one depicting the magistrates of the Catharina and Caecilia Hospitals (the latter now houses the museum), a second showing a Prussian peasant from whom a 10-inch sword, swallowed in a drinking bout, has surgically been removed, a third showing renowned surgeon and designer of medical instruments Cornelis Solingen (1680). One of Solingen's inventions (part of the collection) was a screw to unindent a soldiers skull who had been hit by a bullet. Often in those days bullets did not fully penetrate a skull, merely deformed it.

[ 12 ] 2 Drawn from life [ 13 ] Four large allegoric paintings (± 1610) show in stages how the appreciation of a patient for his physician declines, from being a true savior when the illness is at its height, towards being a devil when the bill has been delivered. Three solid figures of Saints Cosmas and Damian , patrons of doctors and pharmacists. Six anatomical books and drawings (1520–1570) and six books on herbs (1480–1590) testify how in the Renaissance there was an urge to study life diligently and not take traditional beliefs for granted. A large collection of baked and painted apothecary jars (1550–1650) and (often ornamented) cast-iron and bronze mortars (1350–1700).

A variety of curved mirrors, used as anamorphic toys, show how a deliberately distorted image can be restored back to the original.

The room also houses a range of instruments ( levers and forceps ) used to facilitate childbirth.

Lastly, shown are models of three out of five of Archimedes ' so called simple machines (lever, inclined plane, wedge, screw and wheel), several hydrostatic balances to demonstrate Archimedes' law and two tables of forces which demonstrate interactions of forces in a horizontal plane.

5 Leiden University: Linnaeus and Van Musschenbroek [ 16 ] Magdeburg hemispheres Carl Linnaeus published his famous Systema Naturae in 1735, during his 3-year stay in the Dutch Republic, in which he also earned a degree in medicine, and closely worked together with Boerhaave. At display are paintings of Linnaeus and Boerhaave. Also 18th-century models and scientific measuring instruments: models that demonstrate basic physics principles, and instruments: several antique thermometers , a barometer , a theodolite and several pyrometers . Also two antique globes (one showing the heavens, one earth) and two mirror telescopes . The room is conamed after the brothers van Mussenbroeck: Pieter a professor, credited with the invention of the first capacitor in 1746: the Leyden jar , and Jan a famous instrument maker, who shipped his hand crafted precision thermometers all over Europe.

6 Wonders of nature [ 17 ] Room 6: Wonders of Nature Over 30 antique microscopes are shown, most from the 18th century, in a large variety, with different solutions for lighting the subject and minimization of lens defects (e.g.

chromatic aberration ): simple, compound and reflecting microscopes, so called English microscopes (renowned for their quality), solar microscopes (which project their image on a wall, using sunlight only). Several wooden cabinets with microscopic slides are testimony of the craftsmanship than went into collections of ready made samples, which at the time were highly fashionable among well-to-do citizens who took an interest in scientific developments.

This pen was gifted to Ehrenfest as a thank you gift for the friendship that he and Einstein shared, and because Ehrenfest created a professorship for Einstein. Einstein was a 'bijzonder hoogleraar', meaning a professor by special appointment made possible by the Leids Universiteits Fonds from 1920 up to officially 1946. In the first half of his appointment he visited Leiden regularly to give lectures.

[ 34 ] Leiden Museum Boerhaave Einstein Pen There is a note with the pen on which is written (In German): 'This pen has been used for years by Einstein, especially during the time between 1912 and 1921 – So that all his designs and calculations relating to general relativity and gravity from this time period are written with this pen. He gave this pen to me in 1921. P. Ehrenfest. ' [ 35 ] References [ edit ] ^ (in Dutch) 80 jaar Museum Boerhaave . Museum Boerhaave. Retrieved on 2012-01-24.
