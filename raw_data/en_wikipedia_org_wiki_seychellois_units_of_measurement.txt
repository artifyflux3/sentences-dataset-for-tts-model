The metric system has been compulsory in Seychelles (and adopted since 1880).

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Before metric adoption, old French, British and some additional units were used.

System before metric system [ edit ] Units from old French and British systems, were used before metrication.

Capacity [ edit ] In addition to old French and British units, following units were used: 1 cash = 227.11 L 1 velt = 1 ⁄ 30 cash.
