Legislative history Introduced in the House as H.R. 5722 by Julius Kahn ( R - CA ) on May 2, 1924 Committee consideration by House Military Affairs Passed the House on January 21, 1925 (Passed) Passed the Senate on February 18, 1925 (Passed) Reported by the joint conference committee on February 19, 1925; agreed to by the Senate on February 26, 1925 (Agreed) and by the House on February 28, 1925 (Agreed) Signed into law by President Calvin Coolidge on March 3, 1925 Helium Act of 1925 is a United States statute drafted for the purpose of conservation, exploration, and procurement of helium gas. As since amended, it is currently codified beginning at section 167 of Title 50 of the United States Code . The Act of Congress authorized the condemnation, lease, or purchase of acquired lands bearing the potential of producing helium gas. It banned the export of helium, for which the US was the only important source, thus forcing foreign airships to use hydrogen lift gas.

[ 1 ] The Act empowered the United States Department of the Interior and United States Bureau of Mines with the jurisdiction for the experimentation, production , repurification, and research of the lighter than air gas. The Title 50 codified law provided the authority for the creation of the National Helium Reserve .

Privatization of Helium Act [ edit ] The 104th United States Congress introduced four introductory bills in pursuit of privatizing the federal helium production and refining efforts of the United States .

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] On October 9, 1996, the Clinton Administration abolished the U.S. Federal Helium Refining Program through the passage of the Helium Privatization Act of 1996 .
