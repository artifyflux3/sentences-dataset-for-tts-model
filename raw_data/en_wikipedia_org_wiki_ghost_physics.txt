These ghosts are introduced to maintain gauge invariance in theories where the local field components exceeds the number of physical degrees of freedom . Ghosts ensure mathematical consistency in gauge theories.

If a given theory is self-consistent by the introduction of ghosts, these states are labeled "good". Good ghosts are virtual particles that are introduced for regularization , like Faddeev–Popov ghosts . Otherwise, "bad" ghosts admit undesired non-virtual states in a theory, like Pauli–Villars ghosts that introduce particles with negative kinetic energy.

An example of the need of ghost fields is the photon , which is usually described by a four component vector potential A μ , even if light has only two allowed polarizations in the vacuum. To remove the unphysical degrees of freedom, it is necessary to enforce some restrictions; one way to do this reduction is to introduce some ghost field in the theory. While it is not always necessary to add ghosts to quantize the electromagnetic field , ghost fields are strictly needed to consistently and rigorously quantize non-Abelian Yang–Mills theory , such as done with BRST quantization .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] A field with a negative ghost number (the number of ghosts excitations in the field) is called an anti-ghost .

Good ghosts [ edit ] Good ghosts are virtual particles, that are introduced to maintain mathematical consistencies in a gauge theory, and they often serve as a tool for regularization.
A popular example is the Faddeev–Popov ghosts , which arise in the quantization of non-abelian gauge theories . These ghosts assist in the elimination of unphysical degrees of freedom and preserve gauge invariance.

Faddeev–Popov ghosts [ edit ] Main article: Faddeev–Popov ghost Faddeev–Popov ghosts are extraneous anticommuting fields which are introduced to maintain the consistency of the path integral formulation in non-abelian gauge theories , such as the ones describing strong force .

Here's how this works: Person A tries to describe the motion of X particle, but his description consists of too many unnecessary, unphysical variables —many of which don't correspond to anything real or observable. This exact same thing occurs in gauge theories due to their symmetry properties. To remove these unphysical variables, the physicists Ludvig Faddeev and Victor Popov introduced the Faddeev–Popov ghosts , which act like virtual erasers , eliminating the contributions of unphysical variables, and ensuring that only the physical ones exist, preserving the gauge invariance.
They are named after Ludvig Faddeev and Victor Popov .

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] Goldstone bosons [ edit ] Goldstone bosons are sometimes referred to as ghosts, mainly when speaking about the vanishing bosons of the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the electroweak symmetry through the Higgs mechanism . These good ghosts are artifacts of gauge fixing. The longitudinal polarization components of the W and Z bosons correspond to the Goldstone bosons of the spontaneously broken part of the electroweak symmetry SU(2) ⊗ U(1) , which, however, are not observable. Because this symmetry is gauged, the three would-be Goldstone bosons, or ghosts, are "eaten" by the three gauge bosons ( W ± and Z ) corresponding to the three broken generators; this gives these three gauge bosons a mass, and the associated necessary third polarization degree of freedom.

[ 5 ] Bad ghosts [ edit ] "Bad ghosts" represent another, more general meaning of the word "ghost" in theoretical physics: states of negative norm, [ 6 ] or fields with the wrong sign of the kinetic term , such as Pauli–Villars ghosts , whose existence allows the probabilities to be negative thus violating unitarity .

[ 7 ] Ghost condensate [ edit ] This section needs additional citations for verification .

( January 2017 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) A ghost condensate is a speculative proposal in which a ghost, an excitation of a field with a wrong sign of the kinetic term, acquires a vacuum expectation value . This phenomenon breaks Lorentz invariance spontaneously . Around the new vacuum state , all excitations have a positive norm, and therefore the probabilities are positive definite.

We have a real scalar field φ with the following action S = ∫ ∫ d 4 x [ a X 2 − − b X ] {\displaystyle S=\int d^{4}x\left[aX^{2}-bX\right]} where a and b are positive constants and X = d e f 1 2 ∂ ∂ μ μ ϕ ϕ ∂ ∂ μ μ ϕ ϕ {\displaystyle X\ {\stackrel {\mathrm {def} }{=}}\ {\frac {1}{2}}\partial ^{\mu }\phi \partial _{\mu }\phi } The theories of ghost condensate predict specific non-Gaussianities of the cosmic microwave background . These theories have been proposed by Nima Arkani-Hamed , Markus Luty , and others.

[ 8 ] Unfortunately, this theory allows for superluminal propagation of information in some cases and has no lower bound on its energy. This model doesn't admit a Hamiltonian formulation (the Legendre transform is multi-valued because the momentum function isn't convex) because it is acausal . Quantizing this theory leads to problems.

Landau ghost [ edit ] Main article: Landau pole The Landau pole is sometimes referred as the Landau ghost . Named after Lev Landau , this ghost is an inconsistency in the renormalization procedure in which there is no asymptotic freedom at large energy scales.
