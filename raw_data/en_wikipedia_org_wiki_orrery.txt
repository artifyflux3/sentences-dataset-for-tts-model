A small orrery showing Earth and the inner planets

An **orrery** is a mechanical [model of the Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System_model "Solar System model") that illustrates or predicts the relative positions and motions of the [planets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet "Planet") and [moons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_satellite "Natural satellite"), usually according to the [heliocentric model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentric_model "Heliocentric model"). It may also represent the relative sizes of these bodies; however, since accurate scaling is often not practical due to the actual large ratio differences, it may use a scaled-down approximation. [The Greeks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_astronomy "Ancient Greek astronomy") had working [planetaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetarium "Planetarium"), but the first modern example was produced c. 1712 by John Rowley.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orrery#cite_note-1) He named it "orrery"[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orrery#cite_note-2) for his patron [Charles Boyle, 4th Earl of Orrery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Boyle,_4th_Earl_of_Orrery "Charles Boyle, 4th Earl of Orrery") (in [County Cork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Cork "County Cork"), Ireland). The plaque on it reads "Orrery invented by Graham 1700 improved by Rowley and presented by him to John [sic] Earl of Orrery after whom it was named at the suggestion of [Richard Steele](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Steele "Richard Steele")."[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orrery#cite_note-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orrery#cite_note-4)

Orreries are typically driven by a [clockwork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clockwork "Clockwork") mechanism with a globe representing the [Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun "Sun") at the centre, and with a planet at the end of each of a series of arms.

Carlo G Croce, reconstruction of [Dondi's Astrarium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrarium_of_Giovanni_Dondi_dell%27Orologio "Astrarium of Giovanni Dondi dell'Orologio"), originally built between 1348 and 1364 in [Padua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padua "Padua")

The [Antikythera mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antikythera_mechanism "Antikythera mechanism"), discovered in 1901 in a wreck off the Greek island of [Antikythera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antikythera "Antikythera") in the Mediterranean Sea, exhibited the [diurnal motions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diurnal_motion "Diurnal motion") of the [Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun "Sun"), [Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon "Moon"), and the five [planets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet "Planet") known to the [ancient Greeks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece "Ancient Greece"). It has been dated between 205 to 87 BC.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orrery#cite_note-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orrery#cite_note-Carman_Evans-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orrery#cite_note-NYT-20141124-JM-7) The mechanism is considered one of the first orreries.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orrery#cite_note-HMSO-8) It was [geocentric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentric "Geocentric") and used as a mechanical calculator to calculate astronomical positions.

[Cicero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicero "Cicero"), the Roman philosopher and politician writing in the first century BC, has references describing planetary mechanical models. According to him, the Greek polymaths [Thales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thales "Thales")[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orrery#cite_note-9) and [Posidonius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posidonius "Posidonius")[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orrery#cite_note-10) both constructed a device modeling celestial motion.

Astronomical clock (Venus-Mercury side) by Eberhard Baldewein, 1563–1568. Exhibit in the [Mathematisch-Physikalischer Salon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematisch-Physikalischer_Salon "Mathematisch-Physikalischer Salon") of [Dresden, Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dresden,_Germany "Dresden, Germany").

In 1348, [Giovanni Dondi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Dondi_dell%27Orologio "Giovanni Dondi dell'Orologio") built the first known clock driven mechanism of the system. It displays the [ecliptic position](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecliptic_coordinate_system "Ecliptic coordinate system") of the Moon, Sun, [Mercury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(planet) "Mercury (planet)"), [Venus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus "Venus"), [Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars "Mars"), [Jupiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter "Jupiter") and [Saturn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn "Saturn") according to the complicated [geocentric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentrism "Geocentrism") Ptolemaic planetary theories.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orrery#cite_note-11)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orrery#cite_note-Lloyd-12) The clock itself is lost, but Dondi left a complete description of its astronomic [gear trains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gear_train "Gear train").

As late as 1650, P. Schirleus built a geocentric [planetarium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetarium "Planetarium") with the Sun as a planet, and with Mercury and Venus revolving around the Sun as its [moons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_satellite "Natural satellite").[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orrery#cite_note-EE-13)

At the court of [William IV, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_IV,_Landgrave_of_Hesse-Kassel "William IV, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel") two complicated astronomic clocks were built in 1561 and 1563–1568. These use four sides to show the ecliptical positions of the Sun, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, the Moon, Sun and Dragon (Nodes of the Moon) according to [Ptolemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy "Ptolemy"), a calendar, the sunrise and sunset, and an automated [celestial sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_sphere "Celestial sphere") with an animated Sun symbol which, for the first time on a celestial globe, shows the real position of the Sun, including the [equation of time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_time "Equation of time").[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orrery#cite_note-Lloyd2-14)[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orrery#cite_note-15) The clocks are now on display in [Kassel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kassel "Kassel") at the Astronomisch-Physikalisches Kabinett and in [Dresden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dresden "Dresden") at the [Mathematisch-Physikalischer Salon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematisch-Physikalischer_Salon "Mathematisch-Physikalischer Salon").

In _[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De\_revolutionibus\_orbium\_coelestium "De revolutionibus orbium coelestium")_, published in Nuremberg in 1543, [Nicolaus Copernicus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Copernicus "Nicolaus Copernicus") challenged the Western teaching of a geocentric universe in which the Sun revolved daily around the [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth"). He observed that some Greek philosophers such as [Aristarchus of Samos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristarchus_of_Samos "Aristarchus of Samos") had proposed a heliocentric universe. This simplified the apparent [epicyclic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicycle "Epicycle") motions of the planets, making it feasible to represent the planets' paths as simple circles. This could be modeled by the use of gears. [Tycho Brahe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tycho_Brahe "Tycho Brahe")'s improved instruments made precise observations of the skies (1576–1601), and from these [Johannes Kepler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Kepler "Johannes Kepler") (1621) deduced that planets orbited the Sun in [ellipses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipse "Ellipse"). In 1687 [Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton") explained the cause of elliptic motion in his [theory of gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation "Newton's law of universal gravitation").[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orrery#cite_note-Ronan-16)

The orrery built by wool carder [Eise Eisinga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eise_Eisinga "Eise Eisinga") from 1774 to 1781 in his living room, the oldest functioning planetarium in the world

There is an orrery built by clock makers [George Graham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Graham_(clockmaker) "George Graham (clockmaker)") and [Thomas Tompion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Tompion "Thomas Tompion") dated c. 1710 in the [History of Science Museum, Oxford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Science_Museum,_Oxford "History of Science Museum, Oxford").[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orrery#cite_note-17) Graham gave the first model, or its design, to the celebrated instrument maker John Rowley of London to make a copy for [Prince Eugene of Savoy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Eugene_of_Savoy "Prince Eugene of Savoy"). Rowley was commissioned to make another copy for his patron [Charles Boyle, 4th Earl of Orrery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Boyle,_4th_Earl_of_Orrery "Charles Boyle, 4th Earl of Orrery"), from which the device took its name in English.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orrery#cite_note-18)[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orrery#cite_note-ley196502-19) This model was presented to Charles' son John, later the [5th Earl of Cork and 5th Earl of Orrery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Boyle,_5th_Earl_of_Cork "John Boyle, 5th Earl of Cork"). Independently, [Christiaan Huygens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christiaan_Huygens "Christiaan Huygens") published in 1703 details of a heliocentric planetary machine which he had built while living in Paris between 1665 and 1681. He calculated the gear trains needed to represent a year of 365.242 days, and used that to produce the cycles of the principal planets.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orrery#cite_note-EE-13)

[Joseph Wright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Wright_of_Derby "Joseph Wright of Derby")'s painting _[A Philosopher giving a Lecture on the Orrery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A\_Philosopher\_Lecturing\_on\_the\_Orrery "A Philosopher Lecturing on the Orrery")_ (c. 1766), which hangs in the [Derby Museum and Art Gallery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derby_Museum_and_Art_Gallery "Derby Museum and Art Gallery"), depicts a group listening to a lecture by a [natural philosopher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_philosophy "Natural philosophy"). The Sun in a brass orrery provides the only light in the room. The orrery depicted in the painting has rings, which give it an appearance similar to that of an [armillary sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armillary_sphere "Armillary sphere"). The demonstration was thereby able to depict [eclipses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse "Eclipse").[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orrery#cite_note-20)

To put this in chronological context, in 1762 [John Harrison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Harrison "John Harrison")'s [marine chronometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_chronometer "Marine chronometer") first enabled accurate measurement of [longitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude "Longitude"). In 1766, astronomer [Johann Daniel Titius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Daniel_Titius "Johann Daniel Titius") first demonstrated that the mean distance of each planet from the Sun could be represented by the following progression:

![Image 8: {\displaystyle {\frac {4+0}{10}},{\frac {4+3}{10}},{\frac {4+6}{10}},{\frac {4+12}{10}},{\frac {4+24}{10}},...}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b7bb291789dec2b63d421179176e22552d4d23d2)

That is, 0.4, 0.7, 1.0, 1.6, 2.8,... The numbers refer to [astronomical units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit "Astronomical unit"), the mean distance between Sun and Earth, which is 1.496 × 10 8 km (93 × 10 6 miles). The Derby Orrery does not show mean distance, but demonstrated the relative planetary movements.

The [Eisinga Planetarium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eisinga_Planetarium "Eisinga Planetarium") was built from 1774 to 1781 by [Eise Eisinga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eise_Eisinga "Eise Eisinga") in his home in [Franeker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franeker "Franeker"), in the Netherlands. It displays the planets across the width of a room's ceiling, and has been in operation almost continually since it was created.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orrery#cite_note-21) This orrery is a planetarium in both senses of the word: a complex machine showing planetary orbits, and a theatre for depicting the planets' movement. Eisinga house was bought by the Dutch Royal family who gave him a pension.

A 1766 Benjamin Martin Orrery, used at Harvard

In 1764, Benjamin Martin devised a new type of planetary model, in which the planets were carried on brass arms leading from a series of concentric or coaxial tubes. With this construction it was difficult to make the planets revolve, and to get the moons to turn around the planets. Martin suggested that the conventional orrery should consist of three parts: the planetarium where the planets revolved around the Sun, the [tellurion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tellurion "Tellurion") (also _tellurian_ or _tellurium_) which showed the inclined axis of the Earth and how it revolved around the Sun, and the lunarium which showed the eccentric rotations of the Moon around the Earth. In one orrery, these three motions could be mounted on a common table, separately using the central spindle as a prime mover.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orrery#cite_note-HMSO-8)

All orreries are _[planetariums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetarium "Planetarium")_. The term _orrery_ has only existed since 1714. A _grand orrery_ is one that includes the [outer planets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_planet "Outer planet") known at the time of its construction. The word planetarium has shifted meaning, and now usually refers to hemispherical theatres in which images of the night sky are projected onto an overhead surface. Orreries can range widely in size from hand-held to room-sized. An orrery is used to demonstrate the motion of the planets, while a mechanical device used to predict eclipses and [transits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_transit "Astronomical transit") is called an [astrarium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrarium "Astrarium").

An orrery should properly include the Sun, the Earth and the Moon (plus optionally other planets). A model that only includes the Earth, the Moon, and the Sun is called a [tellurion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tellurion "Tellurion") or tellurium, and one which only includes the Earth and the Moon is a [lunarium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunarium "Lunarium"). A [jovilabe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jovilabe "Jovilabe") is a model of Jupiter and its moons.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orrery#cite_note-OU_S100_22-22)

1.   ^ [_**a**_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orrery#cite_ref-retrograde_23-0)[_**b**_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orrery#cite_ref-retrograde_23-1)A negative figure indicates retrograde rotation.

A planetarium will show the [orbital period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_period "Orbital period") of each planet and the _rotation rate_, as shown in the table above. A tellurion will show the [Earth with the Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barycenter "Barycenter") revolving around the Sun. It will use the angle of _inclination of the equator_ from the table above to show how it rotates around its own axis. It will show the Earth's Moon, rotating around the Earth.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orrery#cite_note-Adler-24) A lunarium is designed to show the [complex motions of the Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_of_the_Moon "Orbit of the Moon") as it revolves around the Earth.

Orreries are usually not built to [scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_model "Scale model"). Human orreries, where humans move about as the planets, have also been constructed, but most are temporary. There is a permanent human orrery at [Armagh Observatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armagh_Observatory "Armagh Observatory") in [Northern Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland "Northern Ireland"), which has the six ancient planets, [Ceres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceres_(dwarf_planet) "Ceres (dwarf planet)"), and comets [Halley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halley%27s_Comet "Halley's Comet") and [Encke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_Encke "Comet Encke"). Uranus and beyond are also shown, but in a fairly limited way.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orrery#cite_note-Armagh_Observatory-25) Another is at Sky's the Limit Observatory and Nature Center in [Twentynine Palms, California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twentynine_Palms,_California "Twentynine Palms, California"); it is a true to scale (20 billion to one), true to position (accurate to within four days) human orrery. The first four planets are relatively close to one another, but the next four require a certain amount of hiking in order to visit them.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orrery#cite_note-26) A census of all permanent human orreries has been initiated by the French group F-HOU with a new effort to study their impact for education in schools.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orrery#cite_note-Site_des_plan%C3%A9taires_humains-27) A map of known human orreries is available.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orrery#cite_note-Carte_des_plan%C3%A9taires_humains-28)

A normal mechanical clock could be used to produce an extremely simple orrery to demonstrate the principle, with the Sun in the centre, Earth on the minute hand and Jupiter on the hour hand; Earth would make 12 revolutions around the Sun for every 1 revolution of Jupiter. As Jupiter's actual year is 11.86 Earth years long, the model would lose accuracy rapidly.

Many [planetariums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetarium "Planetarium") have a [projection orrery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetarium_projector "Planetarium projector"), which projects onto the dome of the planetarium a Sun with either dots or small images of the planets. These usually are limited to the planets from Mercury to Saturn, although some include Uranus. The light sources for the planets are projected onto mirrors which are geared to a motor which drives the images on the dome. Typically the Earth will circle the Sun in one minute, while the other planets will complete an orbit in time periods proportional to their actual motion. Thus Venus, which takes 224.7 days to orbit the Sun, will take 37 seconds to complete an orbit on an orrery, and Jupiter will take 11 minutes, 52 seconds.

Some planetariums have taken advantage of this to use orreries to simulate planets and their moons. Thus Mercury orbits the Sun in 0.24 of an Earth year, while [Phobos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phobos_(moon) "Phobos (moon)") and [Deimos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deimos_(moon) "Deimos (moon)") orbit Mars in a similar 4:1 time ratio. Planetarium operators wishing to show this have placed a red cap on the Sun (to make it resemble Mars) and turned off all the planets but Mercury and Earth. Similar approximations can be used to show [Pluto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluto "Pluto") and its five moons.

The last is in Glasgow's [Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvingrove_Art_Gallery_and_Museum "Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum").

The Eisinga Planetarium built by a [wool carder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carding "Carding") named Eise Eisinga in his own living room, in the small city of [Franeker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franeker "Franeker") in [Friesland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friesland "Friesland"), is in fact an orrery. It was constructed between 1774 and 1781. The base of the model faces down from the ceiling of the room, with most of the mechanical works in the space above the ceiling. It is driven by a pendulum clock, which has 9 weights or ponds. The planets move around the model in real time.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orrery#cite_note-Sixma-29)

An innovative concept is to have people play the role of the moving planets and other Solar System objects. Such a model, called a human orrery, has been laid out at the Armagh Observatory.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orrery#cite_note-Armagh_Observatory-25)

In 2024, the LEGO Group commercially produced an orrery of the Sun, Earth, and Moon. The model is assembled exclusively from LEGO elements and reproduces solar and lunar orbits, as well Earth's rotation about a tilted axis.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orrery#cite_note-30)

*   The construction system [Meccano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meccano "Meccano") is a popular tool for constructing highly accurate orreries. Model 391, the first Meccano Orrery, was described in the June 1918 Meccano Manual.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orrery#cite_note-31)[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orrery#cite_note-Meccano-32)
