Selection of astronomical bodies and objects

An **astronomical object**, **celestial object**, **stellar object** or **heavenly body** is a naturally occurring [physical entity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_object "Physical object"), association, or structure that exists within the [observable universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe "Observable universe").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_object#cite_note-1) In [astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy "Astronomy"), the terms _object_ and _body_ are often used interchangeably. However, an **astronomical body** or **celestial body** is a single, tightly bound, contiguous entity, while an astronomical or celestial _object_ is a complex, less cohesively bound structure, which may consist of multiple bodies or even other objects with substructures.

Examples of astronomical objects include [planetary systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_system "Planetary system"), [star clusters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_cluster "Star cluster"), [nebulae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebula "Nebula"), and [galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy "Galaxy"), while [asteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid "Asteroid"), [moons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_satellite "Natural satellite"), [planets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet "Planet"), and [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star "Star") are astronomical bodies. A [comet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet "Comet") may be identified as both a body and an object: It is a _body_ when referring to the frozen [nucleus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_nucleus "Comet nucleus") of ice and dust, and an _object_ when describing the entire comet with its diffuse [coma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coma_(cometary) "Coma (cometary)") and [tail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_tail "Comet tail").

According to [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA "NASA") astrophysicists, early astronomical objects began to emerge plausibly 13.6 billion years ago, roughly 200 million years after the [Big Bang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang "Big Bang") formed the early universe. Over time, light was left from [gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity "Gravity") to fuse into the first [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stars "Stars") and [galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxi "Galaxi").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_object#cite_note-2)

Astronomical objects such as [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star "Star"), [planets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet "Planet"), [nebulae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebula "Nebula"), [asteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid "Asteroid") and [comets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet "Comet") have been observed for thousands of years, although early cultures thought of these bodies as [deities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deities "Deities"). These early cultures found the movements of the bodies very important as they used these objects to help navigate over long distances, tell between the seasons, and to determine when to plant crops. During the [Middle Ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages "Middle Ages"), cultures began to study the movements of these bodies more closely. Several astronomers of the Middle East began to make detailed descriptions of stars and nebulae, and would make more accurate calendars based on the movements of these stars and planets. In Europe, astronomers focused more on devices to help study the celestial objects and creating textbooks, guides, and [universities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universities "Universities") to teach people more about astronomy.

During the [Scientific Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_Revolution "Scientific Revolution"), in 1543, [Nicolaus Copernicus's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Copernicus "Nicolaus Copernicus")[heliocentric model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism "Heliocentrism") was published. This model described the [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth"), along with all of the other planets as being astronomical bodies which orbited the [Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun "Sun") located in the center of the [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System "Solar System"). [Johannes Kepler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Kepler "Johannes Kepler") discovered [Kepler's laws of planetary motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_laws_of_planetary_motion "Kepler's laws of planetary motion"), which are properties of the orbits that the astronomical bodies shared; this was used to improve the heliocentric model. In 1584, [Giordano Bruno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giordano_Bruno "Giordano Bruno") proposed that all distant stars are their own suns, being the first in centuries to suggest this idea. [Galileo Galilei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei "Galileo Galilei") was one of the first astronomers to use telescopes to observe the sky, in 1610 he observed the four largest moons of [Jupiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter "Jupiter"), now named the [Galilean moons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galilean_moons "Galilean moons"). Galileo also made observations of the phases of [Venus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus "Venus"), craters on the [Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon "Moon"), and [sunspots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunspot "Sunspot") on the Sun. Astronomer [Edmond Halley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmond_Halley "Edmond Halley") was able to successfully predict the return of [Halley's Comet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halley%27s_Comet "Halley's Comet"), which now bears his name, in 1758. In 1781, [Sir William Herschel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_William_Herschel "Sir William Herschel") discovered the new planet [Uranus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranus "Uranus"), being the first discovered planet not visible by the naked eye.

In the 19th and 20th centuries, new technologies and scientific innovations allowed scientists to greatly expand their understanding of astronomy and astronomical objects. Larger telescopes and observatories began to be built and scientists began to print images of the Moon and other celestial bodies on photographic plates. New [wavelengths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelength "Wavelength") of light unseen by the human eye were discovered, and new telescopes were made that made it possible to see astronomical objects in other wavelengths of light. [Joseph von Fraunhofer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_von_Fraunhofer "Joseph von Fraunhofer") and [Angelo Secchi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelo_Secchi "Angelo Secchi") pioneered the field of [spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy "Spectroscopy"), which allowed them to observe the composition of stars and nebulae, and many astronomers were able to determine the masses of binary stars based on their [orbital elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_elements "Orbital elements"). Computers began to be used to observe and study massive amounts of astronomical data on stars, and new technologies such as the [photoelectric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoelectric_effect "Photoelectric effect")[photometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photometer "Photometer") allowed astronomers to accurately measure the color and luminosity of stars, which allowed them to predict their temperature and mass. In 1913, the [Hertzsprung–Russell diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertzsprung%E2%80%93Russell_diagram "Hertzsprung–Russell diagram") was developed by astronomers [Ejnar Hertzsprung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejnar_Hertzsprung "Ejnar Hertzsprung") and [Henry Norris Russell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Norris_Russell "Henry Norris Russell") independently of each other, which plotted stars based on their luminosity and color and allowed astronomers to easily examine stars. It was found that stars commonly fell on a band of stars called the [main-sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main-sequence "Main-sequence") stars on the diagram. A refined scheme for [stellar classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_classification "Stellar classification") was published in 1943 by [William Wilson Morgan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Wilson_Morgan "William Wilson Morgan") and [Philip Childs Keenan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Childs_Keenan "Philip Childs Keenan") based on the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram. Astronomers also began debating whether other galaxies existed beyond the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way "Milky Way"), these debates ended when [Edwin Hubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble "Edwin Hubble") identified the [Andromeda nebula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy "Andromeda Galaxy") as a different galaxy, along with many others far from the Milky Way.

The [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe "Universe") can be viewed as having a hierarchical structure.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_object#cite_note-3) At the largest scales, the fundamental component of assembly is the [galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy "Galaxy"). Galaxies are organized into [groups and clusters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_groups_and_clusters "Galaxy groups and clusters"), often within larger [superclusters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercluster "Supercluster"), that are strung along great [filaments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_filament "Galaxy filament") between nearly empty [voids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Void_(astronomy) "Void (astronomy)"), forming a web that spans the observable universe.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_object#cite_note-smolin1998-4)

Galaxies have a variety of [morphologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_morphological_classification "Galaxy morphological classification"), with [irregular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irregular_galaxy "Irregular galaxy"), [elliptical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptical_galaxy "Elliptical galaxy") and [disk-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disc_galaxy "Disc galaxy") shapes, depending on their formation and evolutionary histories, including [interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interacting_galaxy "Interacting galaxy") with other galaxies, which may lead to a [merger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_merger "Galaxy merger").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_object#cite_note-5) Disc galaxies encompass [lenticular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenticular_galaxy "Lenticular galaxy") and [spiral galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_galaxy "Spiral galaxy") with features, such as [spiral arms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_galaxy#Spiral_arms "Spiral galaxy") and a distinct [halo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_halo "Galactic halo"). At the core, most galaxies have a [supermassive black hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermassive_black_hole "Supermassive black hole"), which may result in an [active galactic nucleus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_galactic_nucleus "Active galactic nucleus"). Galaxies can also have satellites in the form of [dwarf galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_galaxy "Dwarf galaxy") and [globular clusters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globular_cluster "Globular cluster").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_object#cite_note-6)

The constituents of a galaxy are formed out of gaseous matter that assembles through gravitational self-attraction in a hierarchical manner. At this level, the resulting fundamental components are the stars, which are typically assembled in clusters from the various condensing nebulae.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_object#cite_note-7) The great variety of stellar forms are determined almost entirely by the mass, composition and evolutionary state of these stars. Stars may be found in multi-star systems that orbit about each other in a hierarchical organization. A planetary system and various minor objects such as asteroids, comets and debris, can form in a hierarchical process of accretion from the [protoplanetary disks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protoplanetary_disk "Protoplanetary disk") that surround newly formed stars.

The various distinctive types of stars are shown by the [Hertzsprung–Russell diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertzsprung%E2%80%93Russell_diagram "Hertzsprung–Russell diagram") (H–R diagram)—a plot of absolute stellar luminosity versus surface temperature. Each star follows an [evolutionary track](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_track "Evolutionary track") across this diagram. If this track takes the star through a region containing an [intrinsic variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrinsic_variable "Intrinsic variable") type, then its physical properties can cause it to become a [variable star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_star "Variable star"). An example of this is the [instability strip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instability_strip "Instability strip"), a region of the H-R diagram that includes [Delta Scuti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Scuti_variable "Delta Scuti variable"), [RR Lyrae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RR_Lyrae_variable "RR Lyrae variable") and [Cepheid variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cepheid_variable "Cepheid variable").[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_object#cite_note-hansen_et_al2004-8) The evolving star may eject some portion of its atmosphere to form a nebula, either steadily to form a [planetary nebula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_nebula "Planetary nebula") or in a [supernova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova "Supernova") explosion that leaves a [remnant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova_remnant "Supernova remnant"). Depending on the initial mass of the star and the presence or absence of a companion, a star may spend the last part of its life as a [compact object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_star "Compact star"); either a [white dwarf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_dwarf "White dwarf"), [neutron star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_star "Neutron star"), or [black hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole "Black hole").

[![Image 18](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/Eros%2C_Vesta_and_Ceres_size_comparison.jpg/250px-Eros%2C_Vesta_and_Ceres_size_comparison.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Eros,_Vesta_and_Ceres_size_comparison.jpg)

Composite image showing the round dwarf planet [Ceres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceres_(dwarf_planet) "Ceres (dwarf planet)"); the slightly smaller, mostly round [Vesta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_Vesta "4 Vesta"); and the much smaller, much lumpier [Eros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/433_Eros "433 Eros")

The [IAU definitions of planet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAU_definition_of_planet "IAU definition of planet") and [dwarf planet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_planet "Dwarf planet") require that a Sun-orbiting astronomical body has undergone the rounding process to reach a roughly spherical shape, an achievement known as [hydrostatic equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrostatic_equilibrium "Hydrostatic equilibrium"). The same [spheroidal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spheroidal "Spheroidal") shape can be seen on smaller rocky planets like [Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars "Mars") to [gas giants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_giant "Gas giant") like [Jupiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter "Jupiter").

Any natural Sun-orbiting body that has not reached hydrostatic equilibrium is classified by the IAU as a [small Solar System body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Solar_System_body "Small Solar System body") (SSSB). These come in many non-spherical shapes which are lumpy masses accreted haphazardly by in-falling dust and rock; not enough mass falls in to generate the heat needed to complete the rounding. Some SSSBs are just collections of relatively small rocks that are weakly held next to each other by gravity but are not actually fused into a single big [bedrock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedrock "Bedrock"). Some larger SSSBs are nearly round but have not reached hydrostatic equilibrium. The small Solar System body [4 Vesta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_Vesta "4 Vesta") is large enough to have undergone at least partial planetary differentiation.

Stars like the Sun are also spheroidal due to gravity's effects on their [plasma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics) "Plasma (physics)"), which is a free-flowing [fluid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid "Fluid"). Ongoing [stellar fusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_fusion "Stellar fusion") is a much greater source of heat for stars compared to the initial heat released during their formation.
