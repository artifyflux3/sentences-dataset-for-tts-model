Find sources: "Symmetrization" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( November 2010 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) In mathematics , symmetrization is a process that converts any function in n {\displaystyle n} variables to a symmetric function in n {\displaystyle n} variables.
Similarly, antisymmetrization converts any function in n {\displaystyle n} variables into an antisymmetric function.

Two variables [ edit ] Let S {\displaystyle S} be a set and A {\displaystyle A} be an additive abelian group . A map α α : S × × S → → A {\displaystyle \alpha :S\times S\to A} is called a symmetric map if α α ( s , t ) = α α ( t , s ) for all s , t ∈ ∈ S .

{\displaystyle \alpha (s,t)=\alpha (t,s)\quad {\text{ for all }}s,t\in S.} It is called an antisymmetric map if instead α α ( s , t ) = − − α α ( t , s ) for all s , t ∈ ∈ S .

{\displaystyle \alpha (s,t)=-\alpha (t,s)\quad {\text{ for all }}s,t\in S.} The symmetrization of a map α α : S × × S → → A {\displaystyle \alpha :S\times S\to A} is the map ( x , y ) ↦ ↦ α α ( x , y ) + α α ( y , x ) .

{\displaystyle (x,y)\mapsto \alpha (x,y)+\alpha (y,x).} Similarly, the antisymmetrization or skew-symmetrization of a map α α : S × × S → → A {\displaystyle \alpha :S\times S\to A} is the map ( x , y ) ↦ ↦ α α ( x , y ) − − α α ( y , x ) .

{\displaystyle (x,y)\mapsto \alpha (x,y)-\alpha (y,x).} The sum of the symmetrization and the antisymmetrization of a map α α {\displaystyle \alpha } is 2 α α .

{\displaystyle 2\alpha .} Thus, away from 2 , meaning if 2 is invertible , such as for the real numbers , one can divide by 2 and express every function as a sum of a symmetric function and an anti-symmetric function.

The symmetrization of a symmetric map is its double, while the symmetrization of an alternating map is zero; similarly, the antisymmetrization of a symmetric map is zero, while the antisymmetrization of an anti-symmetric map is its double.

Bilinear forms [ edit ] The symmetrization and antisymmetrization of a bilinear map are bilinear; thus away from 2, every bilinear form is a sum of a symmetric form and a skew-symmetric form, and there is no difference between a symmetric form and a quadratic form.

At 2, not every form can be decomposed into a symmetric form and a skew-symmetric form. For instance, over the integers , the associated symmetric form (over the rationals ) may take half-integer values, while over Z / 2 Z , {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} /2\mathbb {Z} ,} a function is skew-symmetric if and only if it is symmetric (as 1 = − − 1 {\displaystyle 1=-1} ).

This leads to the notion of ε-quadratic forms and ε-symmetric forms.

Representation theory [ edit ] In terms of representation theory : exchanging variables gives a representation of the symmetric group on the space of functions in two variables, the symmetric and antisymmetric functions are the subrepresentations corresponding to the trivial representation and the sign representation , and symmetrization and antisymmetrization map a function into these subrepresentations – if one divides by 2, these yield projection maps .

As the symmetric group of order two equals the cyclic group of order two ( S 2 = C 2 {\displaystyle \mathrm {S} _{2}=\mathrm {C} _{2}} ), this corresponds to the discrete Fourier transform of order two.

n variables [ edit ] More generally, given a function in n {\displaystyle n} variables, one can symmetrize by taking the sum over all n !

{\displaystyle n!} permutations of the variables, [ 1 ] or antisymmetrize by taking the sum over all n !

/ 2 {\displaystyle n!/2} even permutations and subtracting the sum over all n !

/ 2 {\displaystyle n!/2} odd permutations (except that when n ≤ ≤ 1 , {\displaystyle n\leq 1,} the only permutation is even).

Here symmetrizing a symmetric function multiplies by n !

{\displaystyle n!} – thus if n !

{\displaystyle n!} is invertible, such as when working over a field of characteristic 0 {\displaystyle 0} or p > n , {\displaystyle p>n,} then these yield projections when divided by n !

.

{\displaystyle n!.} In terms of representation theory, these only yield the subrepresentations corresponding to the trivial and sign representation, but for n > 2 {\displaystyle n>2} there are others – see representation theory of the symmetric group and symmetric polynomials .

Bootstrapping [ edit ] Given a function in k {\displaystyle k} variables, one can obtain a symmetric function in n {\displaystyle n} variables by taking the sum over k {\displaystyle k} -element subsets of the variables. In statistics, this is referred to as bootstrapping , and the associated statistics are called U-statistics .
