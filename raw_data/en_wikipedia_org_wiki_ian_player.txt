Ian Player was one of the world's outstanding conservationists and environmental statesmen.

Player was educated at St. John's College , Johannesburg, Union of South Africa . At school he excelled at sports, but a serious knee injury prevented him from pursuing them. He instilled a love of sport and physical discipline in his brother Gary.

[ 2 ] Player served in the 6th Armoured Division attached to the American 5th Army in Italy 1944–46.

[ 3 ] Immediately after the war Player worked in the gold-mines.

[ 4 ] Player's conservation career can said to have begun in 1952 when he became a game ranger in the Umfolozi Game Reserve , in northern Zululand, in the service of the Natal Parks Board.

Protected status for the Umfolozi and St. Lucia Wilderness Areas (now known as the iSimangaliso Wetland Park World Heritage Site)- The first wilderness areas to be zoned in South Africa and on the African continent.

Player was the Founder of the Wilderness Leadership School, [ 6 ] which still runs the original wilderness trails to this day.

In 2004 Player collaborated with Sarah Collins, entrepreneur, visionary, and women's rights activist, to create 'Take Back The Future'. The objective was to tempt mainstream South African youth into this arena of wilderness preservation. 'Take Back The Future' raised money through selling earth worms, and growing and selling vegetables at farmer's markets. By setting up youth groups they were able to innovate and upscale the concept across communities in South Africa.

The Ian Player Foundation has also been established as a charitable organization aiding nature conservation, wildlife activism and environmental education.

In popular culture [ edit ] The famous movie director and producer Howard Hawks , wanted a movie about people who catch animals in Africa for zoos, a dangerous profession with exciting scenes the likes of which had never been seen on-screen before. The name of his blockbuster movie is Hatari!

, starring John Wayne . Hawks increased his knowledge in catching animals from Player's humane work. In 1952 South Africa was disastrously embarked to eliminate all large wild animals to protect livestock, and only 300 white rhinos survived. Player then started his famed rhino catching technique to relocate and save the white rhinos. Player's humane project was called Operation Rhino and the renowned film documentary named Operation Rhino was produced. Hawks studied this film documentary repeatedly to help incorporate aspects of it into his film Hatari!.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] In June 1964, Player appeared on the panel show To Tell the Truth as himself, highlighting his role as warden of Hluhluwe–Imfolozi Park and his work protecting white rhinos .

[ 11 ] Host Bud Collyer noted that scenes of white rhinos shown at the beginning of the episode were from Ivan Tors' movie Rhino!

, released a few weeks earlier, and for which Player acted as a technical advisor.
