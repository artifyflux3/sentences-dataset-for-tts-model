In Euclidean geometry the Newton line is the line that connects the midpoints of the two diagonals in a convex quadrilateral with at most two parallel sides.

[ 1 ] Properties [ edit ] The line segments GH and IJ that connect the midpoints of opposite sides (the bimedians ) of a convex quadrilateral intersect in a point that lies on the Newton line. This point K bisects the line segment EF that connects the diagonal midpoints.

[ 1 ] By Anne's theorem and its converse, any interior point P on the Newton line of a quadrilateral ABCD has the property that [ △ △ A B P ] + [ △ △ C D P ] = [ △ △ A D P ] + [ △ △ B C P ] , {\displaystyle [\triangle ABP]+[\triangle CDP]=[\triangle ADP]+[\triangle BCP],} where [△ ABP ] denotes the area of triangle △ ABP .

[ 2 ] If the quadrilateral is a tangential quadrilateral , then its incenter also lies on this line.
