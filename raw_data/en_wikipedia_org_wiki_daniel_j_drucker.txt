[ 6 ] His scientific research has been a driving force in GLP-1's journey from a newly discovered peptide sequence to the mechanism behind globally used and life-changing therapeutics for type 2 diabetes and obesity . It has also driven transformative new therapeutics for intestinal failure and other metabolic disorders.

[ 7 ] A Fellow of the Royal Society , [ 8 ] and laureate of the 2023 Wolf Prize in Medicine , he is a University Professor of Medicine at the University of Toronto and Senior Investigator at the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute , Sinai Health , Toronto .

Early life and education [ edit ] Drucker was born and grew up in Montreal, went to high school in Ottawa, and then enrolled at the University of Ottawa , studying science.

[ 9 ] In 1976, he moved to Toronto, where he studied medicine at the University of Toronto , graduating in 1980. He completed his internship at Johns Hopkins Hospital (1980–81), and completed his internal medicine and endocrinology residencies at the University of Toronto (1981–84).

[ 9 ] Career and research [ edit ] In 1984, Drucker began his research career at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School , studying molecular endocrinology in the lab of Professor Joel Habener with the support from a Medical Research Council of Canada Centennial Fellowship. Drucker’s independent discoveries in Boston included the demonstration that proglucagon could be cleaved into multiple glucagon-like peptides , including several distinct isoforms of GLP-1 .

[ 10 ] He then discovered that the truncated form of GLP-1(7-37) directly stimulated cyclic AMP formation, insulin secretion, and insulin gene expression ; notably, it did so only when glucose levels were elevated.

[ 3 ] [ 11 ] Further discoveries of the therapeutic potential of GLP-1 at University of Toronto [ edit ] In 1987 Drucker returned to Toronto, taking on the position of Assistant Professor of Medicine at the University of Toronto and continuing his research on the glucagon-like peptides while also working as a physician. In 1996, Drucker was one of several investigators who demonstrated that GLP-1 reduced food intake in preclinical studies. Notably, the experiments in the Drucker lab demonstrated that this action of GLP-1 in the brain required the functional canonical GLP-1 receptor.

[ 4 ] Drucker, together with colleagues at Tufts Universities, filed multiple patents describing the utility of targeting the DPP-4 enzyme, and published studies demonstrating that genetic or chemical inactivation of DPP-4 prevented degradation of GLP-1 and GIP, supporting the development of DPP-4 inhibitors for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.

[ 12 ] [ 13 ] In all, Drucker's discovery science has led to 33 issued US patents supporting translational drug development efforts in the field of peptide based therapeutics. Collectively, the body of work from multiple investigators and companies led to the development of two leading classes of diabetes medications : GLP-1 receptor agonists and DPP4 inhibitors .

[ 9 ] Discovery of GLP-2 actions leading to Short Bowel Syndrome treatments [ edit ] In 1996, Drucker also discovered the first biological actions for GLP-2, demonstrating that it augmented crypt cell proliferation and expansion of the mucosal epithelium in the small bowel of mice and rats.

[ 14 ] He subsequently identified and characterized a DPP-4-resistant molecule, teduglutide, [ 15 ] that was ultimately developed and approved for the treatment of short bowel syndrome in adults and children, a disorder in which fluids are poorly absorbed after resection of the small intestine .

[ 9 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] Research supporting the development, safety and benefits of GLP-1 therapeutics [ edit ] Drucker joined the Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto in 2006. In 2008 he led studies aimed at the development and testing of the first long-acting, once-weekly version of the diabetes medication exenatide .

[ 18 ] He later studied the long-term effects of related weight-loss medicines on bowel health.

[ 19 ] Drucker has also led the identification of the cardioprotective mechanisms of GLP-1 action. Notably, in 2009 he demonstrated in mice that these effects were not dependent on glucose lowering or weight loss [ 5 ] – findings confirmed over a decade later in cardiovascular outcome trials. His discoveries predicted the safety of GLP-1 receptor agonists for their  expanding applications to treat obesity and other chronic conditions. Most recently, Drucker has identified multiple mechanisms linking GLP-1 to the reduction of inflammation [ 6 ] [ 20 ] .

Drucker holds the Banting and Best Diabetes Centre-Novo Nordisk Chair in Incretin Biology. His many national and international recognitions include the 2023 Wolf Prize in Medicine , awarded for "pioneering work in elucidating the mechanisms and therapeutic potential of enteroendocrine hormones," as well as the Warren Alpert Foundation Prize and the Canada Gairdner International Award , among numerous others. Drucker was elected a Royal Society Fellow in 2015, a National Academy of Sciences International Member in 2021and a National Academy of Medicine International Member in 2023. In 2024, he was named among Time magazine's 100 most influential people.
