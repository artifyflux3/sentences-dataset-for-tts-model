Schweber Barry Simon Alan Sokal Arthur Strong Wightman (March 30, 1922 – January 13, 2013) was an American mathematical physicist . He was one of the founders of the axiomatic approach to quantum field theory , and originated the set of Wightman axioms .

[ 1 ] With his rigorous treatment of quantum field theories, he promoted research on various aspects of modern mathematical physics .

[ 2 ] Biography [ edit ] Arthur Wightman was born on March 30, 1922, in Rochester , in New York . He studied at the Yale University and in 1942 he earned a bachelor's degree in physics. In 1949 he received his doctorate at the Princeton University under the supervision of John Wheeler .

[ 3 ] He intended to graduate with Eugene Wigner , but he was spending most of his time at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory .

[ 4 ] In the early 1950s, he started as a young instructor in the Princeton Physics department and later became the Thomas D. Jones Professor of Mathematical Physics, in 1971. He retired in 1992 as professor emeritus .

[ 5 ] In the years 1951–1952 and 1956–1957 he was a visiting researcher at the University of Copenhagen at the Niels Bohr Institute , where he worked in particular with Gunnar Källén and Lars Gårding . In 1957 he was at the University of Paris and in the years 1963–1964 and 1968–1969 at the Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques . Between 1977 and 1978 he was visiting professor at the École Polytechnique in Paris and in 1982 at the University of Adelaide .

[ 6 ] Wightman has been married twice. His first wife, Anna-Greta Larsson, was an artist and photographer and died early. They had a daughter, Robin, who also died prematurely. The second wife was the Bulgarian translator Ludmilla Popova Wightman. Wightman died on January 13, 2013, in Princeton , in New Jersey .

[ 7 ] Scientific career [ edit ] Already during his undergraduate studies, Arthur Wightman had close contacts with the mathematics department in Princeton. Together with the mathematician John Tate , Wightman was engaged in the work on the Lorentz and Poincaré groups representations .

[ 8 ] In the 1950s, he introduced his Wightman axioms as a mathematical foundation to relativistic quantum field theory. Quantum fields are treated as distributions in space-time. The Hilbert space carries a unitary representation of the Poincaré group under which the field operators transform covariantly. Wightman's paper with D. Hall reported to a theorem that stated that the expectation value of the product of two fields, ϕ ϕ ( x ) ϕ ϕ ( y ) {\displaystyle \phi (x)\phi (y)} , could be analytically continued to all separations ( x − − y ) {\displaystyle (x-y)} .

[ 9 ] : 425 Using this, Res Jost was able to derive the PCT and the spin-statistics theorems , as shown in Wightman's and Streater 's book.

[ 10 ] Together with Eugene Wigner and Gian-Carlo Wick , he introduced superselection rules and studied the representations of commutator and anti-commutator algebras with the mathematician Lars Gårding .

[ 11 ] Honors and awards [ edit ] In 1969 Arthur Wightman was awarded the Dannie Heineman Prize for Mathematical Physics for founding and contributing in developing axiomatic quantum field theory [ 12 ] and in 1997 the Henri Poincaré Prize of the International Association of Mathematical Physics [ 13 ] for his central role in the foundations of the general theory of quantum fields.

[ 2 ] Since 1964 he was a fellow of the American Physical Society , [ 14 ] since 1966 of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences , [ 15 ] and since 1970 of the United States National Academy of Sciences .

[ 16 ] In 1962 he was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Stockholm .

[ 17 ] In 1976 he was Josiah Willard Gibbs Lecturer .
