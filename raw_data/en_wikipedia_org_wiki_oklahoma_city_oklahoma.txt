It is the 20th-most populous U.S. city and 8th largest in the Southern United States with a population of 681,054 at the 2020 census , [ 10 ] while the Oklahoma City metropolitan area with an estimated 1.49 million residents is the largest metropolitan area in the state and 42nd-most populous in the nation.

[ 11 ] The county seat of Oklahoma County , [ 12 ] the city limits extend into Canadian , Cleveland , and Pottawatomie counties; however, areas beyond Oklahoma County primarily consist of suburban developments or areas designated rural and watershed zones. Oklahoma City ranks as the tenth-largest city by area in the United States when including consolidated city-counties , and second-largest when such consolidations are excluded. It is also the second-largest state capital by area, following Juneau, Alaska .

Oklahoma City has one of the world's largest livestock markets.

[ 13 ] Oil, natural gas, petroleum products , and related industries are its economy's largest sector. The city is in the middle of an active oil field, and oil derricks dot the capitol grounds. The federal government employs a large number of workers at Tinker Air Force Base and the United States Department of Transportation 's Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center (which house offices of the Federal Aviation Administration and the Transportation Department's Enterprise Service Center, respectively).

Oklahoma City is on the I-35 and I-40 corridors, one of the primary travel corridors south into neighboring Texas and New Mexico , north towards Wichita and Kansas City , west to Albuquerque , and east towards Little Rock and Memphis . Located in the state's Frontier Country region, the city's northeast section lies in an ecological region known as the Cross Timbers . The city was founded during the Land Run of 1889 and grew to a population of over 10,000 within hours of its founding. It was the site of the April 19, 1995, bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building , in which 168 people died.

[ 14 ] Since weather records have been kept beginning in 1890, Oklahoma City has been struck by 13 violent tornadoes , 11 of which were rated F4 or EF4 on the Fujita and Enhanced Fujita scales , and two rated F5 and EF5.

[ 19 ] On April 26 of that year, its first mayor was elected, William Couch . Some 10,000 homesteaders settled in the area that would become the capital of Oklahoma. The town grew quickly; the population doubled between 1890 and 1900.

[ 20 ] Early leaders of the development of the city included Anton H. Classen , John Wilford Shartel , Henry Overholser , Oscar Ameringer , Jack C. Walton , Angelo C. Scott , and James W. Maney .

By the time Oklahoma was admitted to the Union in 1907, Oklahoma City had surpassed Guthrie , the territorial capital, as the new state's population center and commercial hub. Soon after, the capital was moved from Guthrie to Oklahoma City.

[ 21 ] Oklahoma City was a significant stop on U.S. Route 66 during the early part of the 20th century; it was prominently mentioned in Bobby Troup 's 1946 jazz song " (Get Your Kicks on) Route 66 " made famous by artist Nat King Cole .

Before World War II , Oklahoma City developed significant stockyards , attracting jobs and revenue formerly in Chicago and Omaha, Nebraska . With the 1928 discovery of oil within the city limits (including under the State Capitol), Oklahoma City became a major center of oil production.

[ 22 ] Post-war growth accompanied the construction of the Interstate Highway System , which made Oklahoma City a major interchange as the convergence of I-35 , I-40 , and I-44 . It was also aided by the federal development of Tinker Air Force Base after successful lobbying efforts by the director of the Chamber of Commerce Stanley Draper .

In 1950, the Census Bureau reported the city's population as 8.6% black and 90.7% white.

[ 23 ] In 1959, the city government launched a "Great Annexation Drive" that expanded the city's area from 80 to 475.55 square miles (207.2 to 1,231.7 square kilometers) by the end of 1961, making it the largest U.S. city by land mass at the time.

[ 24 ] Patience Latting was elected Mayor of Oklahoma City in 1971, becoming the city's first female mayor.

[ 25 ] Latting was also the first woman to serve as mayor of a U.S. city with over 350,000 residents.

Like many other American cities, the center city population declined in the 1970s and 1980s as families followed newly constructed highways to move to newer housing in nearby suburbs.

Urban renewal projects in the 1970s, including the Pei Plan , removed older structures but failed to spark much new development, leaving the city dotted with vacant lots used for parking. A notable exception was the city's construction of the Myriad Gardens and Crystal Bridge , a botanical garden and modernistic conservatory in the heart of downtown. Architecturally significant historic buildings lost to clearances were the Criterion Theater, [ 26 ] [ 27 ] the Baum Building, [ 28 ] the Hales Building, [ 29 ] [ 30 ] and the Biltmore Hotel.

[ 31 ] In 1993, the city passed a massive redevelopment package known as the Metropolitan Area Projects (MAPS), intended to rebuild the city's core with civic projects to establish more activities and life in downtown. The city added a new baseball park ; a central library; renovations to the civic center , convention center , and fairgrounds; and a water canal in the Bricktown entertainment district. Water taxis transport passengers within the district, adding color and activity along the canal. MAPS has become one of the most successful public-private partnerships undertaken in the U.S., exceeding $3 billion in private investment as of 2010.

[ 32 ] As a result of MAPS, the population in downtown housing has exponentially increased, with the demand for additional residential and retail amenities, such as groceries, services, and shops.

Since the completion of the MAPS projects, the downtown area has seen continued development. Several downtown buildings are undergoing renovation/restoration. Notable among these was the restoration of the Skirvin Hotel in 2007. The famed First National Center is also being renovated.

Residents of Oklahoma City suffered substantial losses on April 19, 1995, when Timothy McVeigh detonated a bomb in front of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building . The building was destroyed (the remnants of which had to be imploded in a controlled demolition later that year), more than 100 nearby buildings suffered severe damage, and 168 people were killed, [ 33 ] making it the deadliest act of domestic terrorism in U.S. history.

[ 34 ] The site of the Murrah Building has been commemorated as the Oklahoma City National Memorial and Museum.

[ 35 ] Since its opening in 2000, over three million people have visited.

[ citation needed ] The "Core-to-Shore" project was created to relocate I-40 one mile (1.6 km) south and replace it with a boulevard to create a landscaped entrance to the city.

[ 36 ] This also allows the central portion of the city to expand south and connect with the shore of the Oklahoma River. Several elements of "Core to Shore" were included in the MAPS 3 proposal approved by voters in late 2009.

In 2012, Devon Energy completed the construction of their new skyscraper, the Devon Energy Center , which immediately became the tallest building in Oklahoma City as well as the state of Oklahoma at 844 feet (257.25m). Culturally, the “Devon Tower”, as it is called by locals, [ 37 ] has been considered the centerpiece of the city’s skyline. Mayor Mick Cornett attended the building’s opening ceremony and stated, "The visual impact it has on the city is so striking and so identifiable. It took just over three years to complete the building that has quickly become a staple in our city's skyline." [ 38 ] Geography [ edit ] Mid-May 2006 photograph of Oklahoma City taken from the International Space Station (ISS) Oklahoma City lies along one of the primary corridors into Texas and Mexico and is a three-hour drive from the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex . The city is in the Frontier Country region in the state's center, making it ideal for state government.

According to the United States Census Bureau , the city has a total area of 620.79 square miles (1,607.8 km 2 ), [ 39 ] of which 601.11 square miles (1,556.9 km 2 ) is land and 19.23 square miles (49.8 km 2 ) is water. The city has annexed 480 net acres under the leadership of Mayor David Holt.

Oklahoma City lies in the Sandstone Hills region of Oklahoma, known for hills of 250 to 400 feet (80 to 120 m) and two species of oak: blackjack oak ( Quercus marilandica ) and post oak ( Q. stellata ).

[ 40 ] The northeastern part of the city and its eastern suburbs fall into an ecological region known as the Cross Timbers .

[ 41 ] The city is roughly bisected by the North Canadian River (recently renamed the Oklahoma River inside city limits). The North Canadian once had sufficient flow to flood every year, wreaking destruction on surrounding areas, including the central business district and the original Oklahoma City Zoo.

[ 42 ] In the 1940s, a dam was built on the river to manage the flood control and reduce its level.

[ 43 ] In the 1990s, as part of the citywide revitalization project known as MAPS, the city built a series of low-water dams, returning water to the portion of the river flowing near downtown.

[ 44 ] The city has three large lakes: Lake Hefner and Lake Overholser , in the northwestern quarter of the city; and the largest, Lake Stanley Draper , in the city's sparsely populated far southeast portion.

The population density typically reported for Oklahoma City using the area of its city limits can be misleading. Its urbanized zone covers roughly 244 square miles (630 km 2 ) resulting in a 2013 estimated density of 2,500 per square mile (970/km 2 ), compared with larger rural watershed areas incorporated by the city, which cover the remaining 377 sq mi (980 km 2 ) of the city limits.

[ 45 ] Oklahoma City is one of the largest cities in the nation in compliance with the Clean Air Act .

[ citation needed ] The city is bisected geographically and culturally by the North Canadian River, which divides North Oklahoma City and South Oklahoma City. The north side is characterized by diverse and fashionable urban neighborhoods near the city center and sprawling suburbs further north. South Oklahoma City is generally more blue-collar working class and significantly more industrial, having grown up around the Stockyards and meat packing plants at the turn of the century. It is also the center of the city's rapidly growing Latino community.

Downtown Oklahoma City , which has 7,600 residents, is seeing an influx of new private investment and large-scale public works projects, which have helped to revitalize a central business district left almost deserted by the Oil Bust of the early 1980s. The centerpiece of downtown is the newly renovated Crystal Bridge and Myriad Botanical Gardens, one of the few elements of the Pei Plan to be completed. In 2021, a massive new central park will link the gardens near the CBD and the new convention center to be built just south of it to the North Canadian River as part of a massive works project known as "Core to Shore"; the new park is part of MAPS3, a collection of civic projects funded by a one-cent temporary (seven-year) sales tax increase.

[ 57 ] Climate [ edit ] Main article: Climate of Oklahoma City Oklahoma City has a temperate humid subtropical climate ( Köppen : Cfa , Trewartha : Cfak ), along with significant continental influences. The city features hot, humid summers and cool winters. Prolonged and severe droughts (sometimes leading to wildfires in the vicinity) and hefty rainfall leading to flash flooding and flooding occur regularly. Consistent winds, usually from the south or south-southeast during the summer, help temper the hotter weather. Consistent northerly winds during the winter can intensify cold periods. Severe ice storms and snowstorms happen sporadically during the winter.

The average temperature is 61.4 °F (16.3 °C), with the monthly daily average ranging from 39.2 °F (4.0 °C) in January to 83.0 °F (28.3 °C) in July. Extremes range from −17 °F (−27 °C) on February 12, 1899 to 113 °F (45 °C) on August 11, 1936, and August 3, 2012 ; [ 58 ] The last sub-zero (Fahrenheit) reading was −14 °F (−26 °C) on February 16, 2021.

[ 59 ] [ 60 ] Temperatures reach 100 °F (38 °C) on 10.4 days of the year, 90 °F (32 °C) on nearly 70 days, and fail to rise above freezing on 8.3 days.

[ 59 ] The city receives about 35.9 inches (91.2 cm) of precipitation annually, of which 8.6 inches (21.8 cm) is snow.

The report "Regional Climate Trends and Scenarios for the U.S. National Climate Assessment" ( NCA ) from 2013 by NOAA projects that parts of the Great Plains region can expect up to 30% (high emissions scenario based on CMIP3 and NARCCAP models) increase in extreme precipitation days by mid-century. This definition is based on days receiving more than one inch of rainfall.

[ 61 ] Extreme weather [ edit ] Oklahoma City has an active severe weather season from March through June, especially during April and May. Being in the center of what is colloquially referred to as Tornado Alley , it is prone to widespread and severe tornadoes, as well as severe hailstorms and occasional derechoes . Tornadoes occur every month of the year, and a secondary smaller peak also occurs during autumn, especially in October. The Oklahoma City metropolitan area is one of the most tornado-prone major cities in the world, with about 150 tornadoes striking within the city limits since 1890. Since the time weather records have been kept, Oklahoma City has been struck by 13 violent tornadoes, eleven rated F/EF4 and two rated F/EF5.

[ 15 ] On May 3, 1999 , parts of Oklahoma City and surrounding communities were impacted by a tornado. It was the last U.S. tornado to be given a rating of F5 on the Fujita scale before the Enhanced Fujita scale replaced it in 2007. While the tornado was in the vicinity of Bridge Creek to the southwest, wind speeds of 318 mph (510 km/h) were estimated by a mobile Doppler radar, the highest wind speeds ever recorded on Earth.

[ 62 ] A second top-of-the-scale tornado occurred on May 20, 2013; South Oklahoma City, along with Newcastle and Moore , was hit by an EF5 tornado. The tornado was 0.5 to 1.3 miles (0.80 to 2.09 km) wide and killed 23 people.

[ 63 ] On May 31, less than two weeks after the May 20 event, another outbreak affected the Oklahoma City area. Within Oklahoma City, the system spawned an EF1 and an EF0 tornado, and in El Reno to the west, an EF3 tornado occurred.

The Thunder is known by several nicknames, including "OKC Thunder" and simply "OKC", and its mascot is Rumble the Bison .

After arriving in Oklahoma City for the 2008–09 season, the Oklahoma City Thunder secured a berth (8th) in the 2010 NBA Playoffs the following year after boasting its first 50-win season, winning two games in the first round against the Los Angeles Lakers . In 2012, Oklahoma City made it to the NBA Finals but lost to the Miami Heat in five games. In 2013, the Thunder reached the Western Conference semi-finals without All-Star guard Russell Westbrook , who was injured in their first-round series against the Houston Rockets , only to lose to the Memphis Grizzlies . In 2014, Oklahoma City reached the NBA's Western Conference Finals again but eventually lost to the San Antonio Spurs in six games.

Sports analysts have regarded the Oklahoma City Thunder as one of the elite franchises of the NBA's Western Conference and a media darling of the league's future. Oklahoma City earned Northwest Division titles every year from 2011 to 2014 and again in 2016 and has consistently improved its win record to 59 wins in 2014. The Thunder is led by third-year head coach Mark Daigneault and is anchored by All-Star point guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander ; acquired from the Los Angeles Clippers in a trade in the summer of 2019. They returned to the NBA Finals in 2025 and defeated the Indiana Pacers in seven games to win their first NBA championship since moving to Oklahoma City.

Hornets [ edit ] Main article: Effect of Hurricane Katrina on the New Orleans Hornets In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina , the NBA's New Orleans Hornets temporarily relocated to the Ford Center , playing the majority of its home games there during the 2005–06 and 2006–07 seasons. The team became the first NBA franchise to play regular-season games in Oklahoma.

[ 121 ] The team was known as the New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets while playing in Oklahoma City.
The team returned to New Orleans full-time for the 2007–08 season. The Hornets played their final home game in Oklahoma City during the exhibition season on October 9, 2007, against the Houston Rockets .

Professional sports teams [ edit ] Main article: Sports in Oklahoma City Current professional sports teams Sports Franchise League Sport Founded Stadium (capacity) Oklahoma City Thunder NBA Basketball 2008 Paycom Center (18,203) Oklahoma City Comets MiLB Baseball 1998 Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark (13,066) Oklahoma City Blue NBA G League Basketball 2018 Paycom Center (18,203) Oklahoma City Energy USL Championship (Division 2) Soccer 2018 Taft Stadium (7,500) Oklahoma City Football Club Women's Premier Soccer League Soccer 2022 Brian Harvey Field (1,500) Oklahoma City Spark Women's Professional Fastpitch Softball 2023 USA Softball Hall of Fame Stadium (13,500) 2028 Olympics [ edit ] Venues in Oklahoma City will host two events during the 2028 Summer Olympics , which will primarily be held in Los Angeles . The LA Olympic Organizing Committee opted to have canoe slalom and softball in Oklahoma City, given the lack of acceptable venues for those sports in Los Angeles. Riversport OKC will host the canoe slalom competition, while Devon Park will host the softball competition. Oklahoma City is located approximately 1,300 miles away from Los Angeles.

[ 122 ] Parks and recreation [ edit ] Myriad Botanical Gardens, the centerpiece of downtown OKC's central business district Oklahoma City has more than 170 parks [ 123 ] that cover 6,256 acres, [ 124 ] and 100 miles of trails.

One of the more prominent landmarks of downtown Oklahoma City is the Crystal Bridge tropical conservatory at the Myriad Botanical Gardens , a large downtown urban park. Designed by I. M. Pei , the park also includes the Water Stage amphitheater, a bandshell, and lawn, a sunken pond complete with koi, an interactive children's garden complete with a carousel and water sculpture, various trails and interactive exhibits that rotate throughout the year including the ice skating in the Christmas winter season. In 2007, following a renovation of the stage, Oklahoma Shakespeare In The Park relocated to the Myriad Gardens. Bicentennial Park, also downtown located near the Oklahoma City Civic Center campus, is home to the annual Festival of the Arts in April.

The Scissortail Park is just south of the Myriad Gardens, a large interactive park that opened in 2021. This park contains a large lake with paddleboats, a dog park, a concert stage with a great lawn, a promenade including the Skydance Bridge, a children's interactive splash park and playground, and numerous athletic facilities. Farmers Market is a common attraction at Scissortail Park during the season, and there are multiple film showings, food trucks, concerts, festivals, and civic gatherings.

Returning to the city's first parks masterplan, Oklahoma City has at least one major park in each quadrant outside downtown.

Will Rogers Park , the Grand Boulevard loop once connected Lincoln Park, Trosper Park, and Woodson Park, some sections of which no longer exist. Martin Park Nature Center is a natural habitat in far northwest Oklahoma City. Will Rogers Park is home to the Lycan Conservatory , the Rose Garden, and the Butterfly Garden, all built in the WPA era. In April 2005, the Oklahoma City Skate Park at Wiley Post Park was renamed the Mat Hoffman Action Sports Park to recognize Mat Hoffman , an Oklahoma City area resident and businessman who was instrumental in the design of the skate park and is a 10-time BMX World Vert champion.

[ 125 ] Walking trails line the Bricktown Canal and the Oklahoma River in downtown. The city's bike trail system follows around Lake Hefner and Lake Overholser in the northwest and west quadrants of the city. The majority of the east shore area of Lake Hefner is taken up by parks and bike trails, including a new leashless dog park and the postwar-era Stars and Stripes Park , and eateries near the lighthouse. Lake Stanley Draper, in southeast Oklahoma City, is the city's largest and most remote lake, offering a genuine rural yet still urban experience.

The Oklahoma City Zoo and Botanical Garden is home to numerous natural habitats, WPA era architecture and landscaping, and major touring concerts during the summer at its amphitheater. Nearby is a combination racetrack and casino, Remington Park , which hosts both Quarter Horse (March – June) and Thoroughbred (August—December) seasons.

Oklahoma City is also home to the American Banjo Museum , which houses a large collection of highly decorated banjos from the early 20th century and exhibits the banjo's history and its place in American history. Concerts and lectures are also held there.

Government [ edit ] Main article: Government of Oklahoma City See also: List of mayors of Oklahoma City Oklahoma State Capitol, seen from the OK History Center The Art Deco city hall building, a block from the Civic Center The City of Oklahoma City has operated under a council-manager form of city government since 1927.

[ 126 ] David Holt assumed the office of Mayor on April 10, 2018, after being elected two months earlier.

[ 127 ] Eight councilpersons represent each of the eight wards of Oklahoma City. The City Council appointed current City Manager Craig Freeman on November 20, 2018. Freeman took office on January 2, 2018, succeeding James D. Couch, who had served in the role since 2000. Before becoming City Manager, Craig Freeman served as Finance Director for the city.

[ 128 ] Politics [ edit ] Similar to many American cities, Oklahoma City is politically conservative in its suburbs and liberal in the central city. In the United States House of Representatives , it is represented by Republicans Stephanie Bice , Tom Cole , and Frank Lucas of the 5th, 4th, and 3rd districts, respectively. The city has called on residents to vote for sales tax-based projects to revitalize parts of the city. The Bricktown district is the best example of such an initiative. In the recent MAPS 3 vote, the city's fraternal police order criticized the project proposals for not doing enough to expand the police presence to keep up with the growing residential population and increased commercial activity. In September 2013, Oklahoma City area attorney David Slane announced he would pursue legal action regarding MAPS3 on claims the multiple projects that made up the plan violate a state constitutional law limiting voter ballot issues to a single subject.

Primary and secondary [ edit ] Main article: Education in Oklahoma City Bishop McGuinness Catholic High School Oklahoma City is home to (as of 2009) the state's largest school district, Oklahoma City Public Schools , [ 136 ] which covers the most significant portion of the city.

[ 137 ] The district's Classen School of Advanced Studies and Harding Charter Preparatory High School rank high among public schools nationally according to a formula that looks at the number of Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate or Cambridge tests taken by the school's students divided by the number of graduating seniors.

[ 138 ] In addition, OKCPS's Belle Isle Enterprise Middle School was named the top middle school in the state according to the Academic Performance Index and recently received the Blue Ribbon School Award, in 2004 and again in 2011.

[ 139 ] Due to Oklahoma City's explosive growth, parts of several suburban districts spill into the city. All but one of the school districts in Oklahoma County includes portions of Oklahoma City.

Broadcast [ edit ] Oklahoma City was home to several pioneers in radio and television broadcasting. Oklahoma City's WKY Radio was the first radio station transmitting west of the Mississippi River and the third radio station in the United States.

[ 143 ] WKY received its federal license in 1921 and has continually broadcast under the same call letters since 1922. In 1928, WKY was purchased by E.K. Gaylord 's Oklahoma Publishing Company and affiliated with the NBC Red Network ; in 1949, WKY-TV (channel 4) went on the air and later became the first independently owned television station in the U.S. to broadcast in color.

[ 143 ] In mid-2002, WKY radio was purchased outright by Citadel Broadcasting , who was bought out by Cumulus Broadcasting in 2011. The Gaylord family earlier sold WKY-TV in 1976, which has gone through a succession of owners (what is now KFOR-TV is owned by Nexstar Media Group as of October 2019).

The major U.S. broadcast television networks have affiliates in the Oklahoma City market (ranked 41st for television by Nielsen and 48th for radio by Arbitron , covering a 34-county area serving the central, north-central and west-central sections of Oklahoma); including NBC affiliate KFOR-TV (channel 4), ABC affiliate KOCO-TV (channel 5), CBS affiliate KWTV-DT (channel 9, the flagship of locally based Griffin Media ), PBS station KETA-TV (channel 13, the flagship of the state-run OETA member network), Fox affiliate KOKH-TV (channel 25), independent station KOCB (channel 34), CW owned-and-operated station KAUT-TV (channel 43), MyNetworkTV affiliate KSBI-TV (channel 52), and Ion Television affiliate KOPX-TV (channel 62). The market is also home to several religious stations, including TBN owned-and-operated station KTBO-TV (channel 14) and Norman-based Daystar owned-and-operated station KOCM (channel 46).

Despite the market's geographical size, none of the English-language commercial affiliates in the Oklahoma City designated market area operate full-power satellite stations covering the far northwestern part of the state (requiring cable or satellite to view them). However, KFOR-TV, KOCO-TV, KWTV-DT, and KOKH-TV each operate low-power translators in that portion of the market. Oklahoma City is one of the few markets between Chicago and Dallas to have affiliates of two or more of the significant Spanish-language broadcast networks: Telemundo affiliate KTUZ-TV (channel 30), Woodward -based Univision / UniMás affiliate KUOK 35 (whose translator KUOK-CD, channel 36, serves the immediate Oklahoma City area), and Estrella TV affiliate KOCY-LD (channel 48). (Locally based Tyler Media Group , which owns the three stations above, also owns eight radio stations in the market, including Regional Mexican -formatted KTUZ-FM (106.7) and news–talk outlet KOKC (1520 AM).) Infrastructure [ edit ] Fire department [ edit ] OKCFD dive team at Lake Hefner OKCFD ambulance Oklahoma City is protected by the Oklahoma City Fire Department (OKCFD), which employs 1015 paid, professional firefighters. The current Chief of Department is Richard Kelley, and the department is commanded by three Deputy Chiefs, who – along with the department chief – oversee the Operational Services, Prevention Services, and Support Services bureaus. The OKCFD operates out of 37 fire stations throughout the city in six battalions. The OKCFD operates a fire apparatus fleet of 36 engine companies (including 30 paramedic engines), 13 ladder companies, 16 brush pumper units, six water tankers, two hazardous materials units, one Technical Rescue Unit, one Air Supply Unit, six Arson Investigation Units, and one Rehabilitation Unit along with several special units. Each engine Company is staffed with a driver, an officer, and one to two firefighters, while each ladder company is staffed with a driver, an officer, and one firefighter. The minimum staffing for each shift is 213 personnel. The Oklahoma City Fire Department responds to over 70,000 emergency calls annually.

[ 144 ] [ 145 ] [ 146 ] Transportation [ edit ] Main article: Transportation in Oklahoma City Highways [ edit ] Oklahoma City is an integral point on the United States Interstate Network , with three major interstate highways – Interstate 35 , Interstate 40 , and Interstate 44 – bisecting the city.

Interstate 240 connects Interstate 40 and Interstate 44 in south Oklahoma City. At the same time, Interstate 235 spurs from Interstate 44 in north-central Oklahoma City into downtown. Interstate 44, between NW 23rd and NW 36th Streets, is the busiest roadway in the city and state, with an average daily traffic count of 167,200 vehicles per day in 2018.

[ 147 ] Major state expressways through the city include Lake Hefner Parkway ( SH-74 ), the Kilpatrick Turnpike , Airport Road ( SH-152 ), and Broadway Extension ( US-77 ) which continues from I-235 connecting Central Oklahoma City to Edmond. Lake Hefner Parkway runs through northwest Oklahoma City, while Airport Road runs through southwest Oklahoma City and leads to Will Rogers World Airport . The Kilpatrick Turnpike loops around north and west Oklahoma City.

Oklahoma City also has several major national and state highways within its city limits. Shields Boulevard (US-77) continues from E.K. Gaylord Boulevard in downtown Oklahoma City and runs south, eventually connecting to I-35 near the suburb of Moore, Oklahoma . Northwest Expressway (Oklahoma State Highway 3) runs from North Classen Boulevard in north-central Oklahoma City to the northwestern suburbs.

The following significant expressways traverse Oklahoma City: Interstate 35 Interstate 40 (Crosstown Expressway, Stanley Draper Expressway, Tinker Diagonal, Tom Stead Memorial Highway) Interstate 44 (Turner Turnpike, Belle Isle Freeway, Will Rogers Expressway, H.E. Bailey Turnpike) Interstate 235 (Centennial Expressway) / U.S. 77 (Broadway Extension) Interstate 240 (Southwest Expressway) Lake Hefner Parkway (State Highway 74) Airport Road (State Highway 152) Kilpatrick Turnpike (Interstate 344) Air [ edit ] Oklahoma City is served by two primary airports, Will Rogers World Airport and the much smaller Wiley Post Airport (incidentally, the two honorees died in the same plane crash in Alaska ) [ 148 ] Will Rogers World Airport is the state's busiest commercial airport, with 4,341,159 passengers served in 2018, a historical record.

[ 149 ] Tinker Air Force Base , in southeast Oklahoma City, is the largest military air depot in the nation. It is a major maintenance and deployment facility for the Navy and the Air Force and the second largest military institution in the state (after Fort Sill in Lawton ).

United Airlines Embraer 170 aircraft at the East Concourse of Will Rogers World Airport Rail and intercity bus [ edit ] Amtrak has a station downtown at the Santa Fe Depot , with daily service to Fort Worth and the nation's rail network via the Heartland Flyer . Oklahoma City once was the crossroads of several interstate passenger railroads at the Santa Fe Depot, the Union Station, and the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad station.

[ 150 ] But service at that level has long since been discontinued. However, several proposals to extend the current train service have been made, including a plan to expand the Heartland Flyer to Newton, Kansas , which is currently being connected through Amtrak Thruway . Freight service is provided by BNSF Railway , Union Pacific Railroad , and Stillwater Central.

Greyhound and several other intercity bus companies serve Oklahoma City at the Oklahoma City Bus Station east of downtown.

Public transit [ edit ] Main articles: Embark (transit authority) and Oklahoma City Streetcar Streetcar of the OKC Streetcar system passing the historic First United Methodist Church, in downtown Embark (formerly Metro Transit) is the city's public transit company. The primary transfer terminal is downtown at NW 5th Street and Hudson Avenue. Embark maintains limited coverage of the city's primary street grid using a hub-and-spoke system from the main terminal, making many journeys impractical due to the relatively small number of bus routes offered and that most trips require a transfer downtown. The city has recognized transit as a significant issue for the rapidly growing and urbanizing city. It has initiated several recent studies to improve the existing bus system, starting with a plan known as the Fixed Guideway Study.

[ 151 ] This study identified several potential commuter transit routes from the suburbs into downtown Oklahoma City as well as feeder-line bus and rail routes throughout the city.

Though Oklahoma City has no light rail or commuter rail service, city residents identified improved transit as one of their top priorities. From the fruits of the Fixed Guideway and other studies, city leaders strongly desire to incorporate urban rail transit into the region's future transportation plans. The greater Oklahoma City metropolitan transit plan identified from the Fixed Guideway Study includes a streetcar system in the downtown area, to be fed by enhanced city bus service and commuter rail from the suburbs including Edmond , Norman , and Midwest City . There is a significant push for a commuter rail line connecting downtown OKC with the eastern suburbs of Del City , Midwest City , and Tinker Air Force Base . In addition to commuter rail, a short heritage rail line that would run from Bricktown just a few blocks away from the Amtrak station to the Adventure District in northeast Oklahoma City is under reconstruction.

In December 2009, Oklahoma City voters passed MAPS 3 , the $777 million (7-year, 1-cent tax) initiative. This initiative would generate funding (approx. $130 million) for the modern Oklahoma City Streetcar system in downtown Oklahoma City and the establishment of a transit hub.

On September 10, 2013, the federal government announced that Oklahoma City would receive a $13.8-million grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation's TIGER program . This was the first-ever grant for Oklahoma City for a rail-based initiative and is thought to be a turning point for city leaders who have applied for grants in the past, only to be denied continuously. It is believed the city will use the TIGER grant along with approximately $10  million from the MAPS 3 Transit budget to revitalize the city's Amtrak station, becoming an Intermodal Transportation Hub, taking over the role of the existing transit hub at NW 5th/Hudson Avenue.

[ citation needed ] Construction of the Oklahoma City Streetcar system in Downtown OKC began in early 2017, [ 152 ] and the system opened for service in December 2018.

[ 153 ] [ 154 ] Also known as the Maps 3 Streetcar, it connects the areas of Bricktown, Midtown and Downtown. The 6.9 mi (11.1 km) system serves the greater Downtown area using modern low-floor streetcars. The initial system consists of two lines connecting Oklahoma City's Central Business District with the entertainment district, Bricktown , and the Midtown District. Expansion to other districts surrounding downtown and more routes in the CBD is already underway.

[ citation needed ] Walkability [ edit ] A 2013 study by Walk Score ranked Oklahoma City the 43rd most walkable out of the 50 largest U.S. cities. Oklahoma City has 18 neighborhoods with a Walk Score above 60, mainly close to the downtown core.

[ 155 ] Health [ edit ] OU Physicians Center Oklahoma City and the surrounding metropolitan area have several healthcare facilities and specialty hospitals. In Oklahoma City's MidTown district near downtown resides the state's oldest and largest single-site hospital, St. Anthony Hospital and Physicians Medical Center .

OU Medicine , an academic medical institution on the campus of The University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center , is home to OU Medical Center. OU Medicine operates Oklahoma's only level-one trauma center at the OU Medical Center and the state's only level-one trauma center for children at Children's Hospital at OU Medicine, [ 156 ] both of which are in the Oklahoma Health Center district. Other medical facilities operated by OU Medicine include OU Physicians and OU Children's Physicians, the OU College of Medicine, the Oklahoma Cancer Center, and OU Medical Center Edmond, the latter in the northern suburb of Edmond .

INTEGRIS Baptist Medical Center INTEGRIS Health owns several hospitals, including INTEGRIS Baptist Medical Center, the INTEGRIS Cancer Institute of Oklahoma, [ 157 ] and the INTEGRIS Southwest Medical Center.

[ 158 ] INTEGRIS Health operates hospitals, rehabilitation centers, physician clinics, mental health facilities, independent living centers, and home health agencies throughout much of Oklahoma. INTEGRIS Baptist Medical Center ranks high-performing in the following categories: Cardiology and Heart Surgery; Diabetes and Endocrinology; Ear, Nose and Throat; Gastroenterology; Geriatrics; Nephrology; Orthopedics; Pulmonology and Urology.

The Midwest Regional Medical Center is in the suburb of Midwest City ; other significant hospitals include the Oklahoma Heart Hospital and the Mercy Health Center. There are 347 physicians for every 100,000 people in the city.

In the American College of Sports Medicine 's annual ranking of the United States' 50 most populous metropolitan areas on the basis of community health, Oklahoma City took last place in 2010, falling five spots from its 2009 rank of 45.

[ 159 ] The ACSM's report, published as part of its American Fitness Index program , cited, among other things, the poor diet of residents, low levels of physical fitness, higher incidences of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease than the national average, low access to recreational facilities like swimming pools and baseball diamonds, the paucity of parks and low investment by the city in their development, the high percentage of households below the poverty level, and the lack of state-mandated physical education curriculum as contributing factors.
