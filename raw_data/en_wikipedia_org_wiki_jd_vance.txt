Early life, military service, and education Vance was born James Donald Bowman on August 2, 1984, in Middletown, Ohio , [ 2 ] [ 3 ] where he was also raised.

[ 4 ] He grew up in an Appalachian American culture, spending summers with relatives in Jackson, Kentucky .

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] His parents are Beverly Carol Aikins (née Vance) and Donald Ray Bowman; they divorced when he was a toddler.

[ 3 ] Vance wrote in his 2016 book about being of Scots-Irish descent, [ 7 ] [ 8 ] but a 2025 report commissioned by Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party found no genealogical link between him and Ireland.

[ 9 ] After Bowman was adopted by his mother's third husband, Bob Hamel, his mother changed his name to James David Hamel to remove his father's first name and surname and to preserve an uncle's first name, David. Vance therefore kept his nickname, JD. His surname changed to hers after her parents became his caretakers.

[ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] Vance has written that his childhood was marked by poverty and abuse, and that his mother struggled with drug addiction .

[ 13 ] He and his elder sister, Lindsay, were raised primarily by their maternal grandparents, James and Bonnie Vance (née Blanton), whom they called "Papaw" and "Mamaw".

[ 14 ] [ 10 ] After graduating from Middletown High School in 2003, Vance enlisted in the United States Marine Corps , [ 15 ] serving as a military journalist with the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing .

[ 16 ] During his four years of service, he was deployed to the Iraq War in 2005 for six months in a non-combat role, writing articles and taking photographs.

[ 15 ] He attained the rank of corporal , and his decorations included the Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal and the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal .

[ 17 ] In 2007, Vance left the military and used the G.I. Bill [ 18 ] [ 19 ] to study at Ohio State University .

[ 20 ] He graduated in 2009 with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree summa cum laude in political science and philosophy.

[ 21 ] In 2010, Vance entered Yale Law School , [ 22 ] where he won a prestigious position on The Yale Law Journal .

[ 23 ] During his first year, Professor Amy Chua persuaded Vance to begin writing his memoir, Hillbilly Elegy .

[ 8 ] [ 24 ] Vance also initiated a rapport with Peter Thiel after attending his 2011 talk at Yale.

[ 23 ] In 2010–2011, Vance wrote for David Frum 's "FrumForum" website under the name J. D. Hamel.

[ 25 ] [ 26 ] Although Hillbilly Elegy states that he adopted his grandparents' surname of Vance upon his marriage in 2014, [ 8 ] [ 27 ] the name change actually occurred in April 2013, as he was about to graduate from Yale.

[ 1 ] [ 23 ] Vance obtained his Juris Doctor (JD) degree from Yale Law School in May 2013.

[ 28 ] Early career Vance (then Hamel) in the U.S. Marine Corps ; 2003 After graduating from law school, Vance worked for Republican senator John Cornyn . He spent a year as a law clerk for Judge David Bunning of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky , [ 29 ] then worked at the law firm Sidley Austin , [ 30 ] beginning a brief career as a corporate lawyer .

[ 31 ] Having practiced law for slightly under two years, Vance moved to San Francisco to work in the technology industry as a venture capitalist .

[ 23 ] Between 2016 and 2017, he served as a principal at Peter Thiel's firm, Mithril Capital .

[ 32 ] [ 33 ] In June 2016, Harper published Vance's book, Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis .

[ 8 ] The memoir recounts the Appalachian culture and socioeconomic problems of Vance's small-town upbringing.

[ 34 ] Hillbilly Elegy was on The New York Times Best Seller list in 2016 and 2017 . The Times listed it among "6 Books to Help Understand Trump's Win", [ 35 ] and Vance was profiled in The Washington Post , which called him "the voice of the Rust Belt ".

[ 36 ] In The New Republic , Sarah Jones criticized Vance as "liberal media's favorite white trash –splainer" and a "false prophet of blue America ", calling the book "little more than a list of myths about welfare queens ".

[ 37 ] Hillbilly Elegy ' s success helped propel Vance into contact with social elites, and he began writing a column for The New York Times . Vance later said that his interactions with social elites from this time, particularly their perceived disdain for "the people he grew up with", helped shape his later views.

[ 38 ] In 2017, Vance joined Revolution LLC , [ 39 ] an investment firm founded by Steve Case .

[ 39 ] Vance was tasked with expanding the "Rise of the Rest" initiative, which focuses on growing investments in underserved regions outside Silicon Valley and New York City.

[ 39 ] Vance was a CNN contributor in 2017 and 2018.

[ 40 ] In April 2017, Ron Howard signed on to direct the film version of Hillbilly Elegy , which was released in select theaters on November 11, 2020. It was released on Netflix for streaming.

[ 41 ] In 2019, Vance served on the board of advisors of the With Honor Fund , a Super PAC that helps veterans run for office.

[ 42 ] From 2020 to 2023, he served on the board of advisors of American Moment, a networking and training organization for young conservatives that is affiliated with Project 2025 .

[ 43 ] [ 44 ] In 2019, Vance and Chris Buskirk co-founded the conservative political advocacy group Rockbridge Network .

[ 45 ] That year, he also co-founded venture capital firm Narya Capital in Cincinnati with financial backing from Thiel, Eric Schmidt , and Marc Andreessen .

[ 46 ] During 2020, he raised $93 million for the firm.

[ 47 ] With Peter Thiel and former Trump adviser Darren Blanton, Vance invested in Rumble , a Canadian online video platform popular with the political right.

[ 48 ] [ 49 ] Our Ohio Renewal Vance speaks about his book Hillbilly Elegy at New America 's Securing the American Dream for Young Children event; 2017.

In December 2016, Vance said he planned to move to Ohio and would consider starting a nonprofit or running for office.

[ 50 ] [ 36 ] In Ohio, he started Our Ohio Renewal, a 501(c)(4) advocacy organization focused on education, addiction, and other "social ills" he had mentioned in his memoir.

[ 51 ] According to a 2017 archived capture of the nonprofit's website, the advisory board members were Keith Humphreys , Jamil Jivani , Yuval Levin , and Sally Satel .

[ 52 ] [ 53 ] According to a 2020 capture of the website, those four remained in those positions throughout the organization's existence.

[ 54 ] Our Ohio Renewal closed by 2021 with sparse achievements.

[ 51 ] [ 55 ] According to Jivani, the organization's director of law and policy, its work was derailed by Jivani's cancer diagnosis .

[ 56 ] [ 57 ] It raised around $221,000 in 2017 (including $80,000 from Vance himself) and spent most of its revenue on overhead costs and travel. In subsequent years, it raised less than $50,000.

[ 53 ] [ 58 ] During Vance's 2022 U.S. Senate campaign, Tim Ryan , the Democratic nominee, said the charity was a front for Vance's political ambitions. Ryan pointed to reports that the organization paid a Vance political adviser and conducted public opinion polling, while its efforts to address addiction failed. Vance denied the characterization.

[ 59 ] [ 60 ] [ b ] Our Ohio Renewal's tax filings show that in its first year, it spent more (over $63,000) on "management services" provided by its executive director Jai Chabria , who also served as Vance's top political adviser, than it did on programs to fight opioid abuse.

[ 64 ] [ 53 ] In 2017, Vance formed a similarly named 501(c)(3) organization, Our Ohio Renewal Foundation, which raised around $69,000 from 2017 to 2023.

[ 58 ] As of September 2024, the foundation had not spent any funds since 2019.

[ 65 ] According to the Associated Press (AP) and a 2019 ProPublica investigation, the charity's biggest accomplishment, sending psychiatrist Sally Satel to Ohio's Appalachian region for a yearlong residency in 2018, was "tainted" by the ties among Satel, her employer, American Enterprise Institute (AEI), and Purdue Pharma , in the form of knowledge exchange between Satel and Purdue and financial support from Purdue to AEI. Satel denied having any relationship with Purdue or any knowledge of its donations to AEI.

[ 66 ] [ 67 ] [ 53 ] AppHarvest From March 2017 to April 2021, Vance served on the board of directors of the startup AppHarvest , which carried out indoor vertical farming in Kentucky. AppHarvest was also one of Narya Capital's first publicly announced investments; Vance publicly advocated for AppHarvest, touting the company's commitment to bring good jobs with health care benefits to an economically depressed area of Appalachia. AppHarvest went bankrupt in 2023 while owing over $340 million.

[ 68 ] Company founder Jonathan Webb and top executives collectively had little experience with horticulture and indoor agriculture, and the company struggled to meet its produce buyers' standards.

[ 69 ] Workers complained to authorities about "brutal" working conditions in company greenhouses; after many local workers quit, they were replaced by migrant contract workers, who eventually constituted over half the company's labor force. Vance never held an operational role at the company, and his vice-presidential campaign said he had been unaware of the complaints about working conditions and that the decision to hire migrants was made after he resigned from the board.

[ 68 ] [ 69 ] U.S. Senate (2023–2025) Main article: US Senate career of JD Vance 2022 campaign Main article: 2022 United States Senate election in Ohio Final results by Ohio county in 2022: JD Vance 80–90% 70–80% 60–70% 50–60% Tim Ryan 60–70% 50–60% In early 2018, Vance considered running for the U.S. Senate against Sherrod Brown , [ 70 ] but did not.

[ 71 ] In March 2021, Peter Thiel gave $10 million to Protect Ohio Values, a super PAC created in February to support a potential Vance candidacy.

[ 72 ] [ 73 ] [ 74 ] Robert Mercer also gave an undisclosed amount.

[ 72 ] In April, Vance expressed interest in running for the Senate seat being vacated by Rob Portman .

[ 75 ] In May, he launched an exploratory committee .

[ 76 ] Vance announced his Senate campaign in Ohio on July 1, 2021.

[ 3 ] On May 3, 2022, he won the Republican primary with 32% of the vote, [ 77 ] defeating multiple candidates, including Josh Mandel (23%) and Matt Dolan (22%).

[ 78 ] On November 8, in the general election, Vance defeated Democratic nominee Tim Ryan with 53% of the vote to Ryan's 47%.

[ 3 ] [ 79 ] This vote share was considered a vast underperformance compared to other Ohio Republicans, especially in the coinciding gubernatorial election .

[ 80 ] Vance had often previously spelled his name with periods after his initials ("J.D.")—including in the publication of Hillbilly Elegy —but after becoming a candidate for office, he removed the periods ("JD").

[ 1 ] Tenure Official Senate portrait, 2023 Vance's 56-minute speech on the U.S foreign policy's response to the Russo-Ukrainian War ; February 12, 2024 On January 3, 2023, Vance was sworn into the Senate as a member of the 118th United States Congress . Vance served as Ohio's junior senator from January 3, 2023, to January 3, 2025. Data from mid-July 2024 showed that he had made 45 Senate speeches and sponsored 57 legislative bills, none of which had passed the Senate. Vance had also co-sponsored 288 bills, of which two passed both the Senate and the House but were vetoed by President Biden.

[ 81 ] On March 1, Vance and Senator Sherrod Brown cosponsored bipartisan legislation to prevent derailments like the one in East Palestine , [ 82 ] [ 83 ] but the bill failed due to lack of intra-caucus Republican support.

[ 84 ] [ 85 ] [ 86 ] In June 2023, Vance voted against raising the debt ceiling, standing against final passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 [ 87 ] and saying it would result in "a reduced military in the face of a rising threat from China".

[ 88 ] In July 2023, Vance and Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene introduced legislation that would have made gender-affirming care for minors a federal crime, with penalties of up to 12 years in prison.

[ 89 ] In June 2024, Vance sponsored the Dismantle DEI Act, which would ban federal diversity, equity, and inclusion programs and funding for agencies, contractors, and organizations receiving federal funds.

[ 90 ] [ 91 ] Vance was not present for any Senate votes during his vice-presidential campaign.

[ 92 ] [ 93 ] Vance became Ohio's senior senator on January 3, 2025, upon the swearing-in of Bernie Moreno . At midnight on January 10, Vance resigned from the Senate in anticipation of his inauguration as vice president of the United States on January 20 .

[ 94 ] On January 17, Governor Mike DeWine announced his appointment of Jon Husted to the Senate seat Vance vacated.

[ 96 ] [ 97 ] On July 15, 2024, the first day of the Republican National Convention , Trump announced on Truth Social that he had chosen Vance as his running mate.

[ 98 ] On July 17, the third day of the convention, Vance accepted the nomination to be Trump's running mate.

[ 99 ] Along with Vance, North Dakota governor Doug Burgum , Florida senator Marco Rubio , and South Carolina senator Tim Scott were finalists to be Trump's running mate.

[ 100 ] Trump's two eldest sons, Donald Trump Jr.

and Eric Trump , advocated for Vance. Several media and industry figures are said to have lobbied for Vance to be on the ticket, including Elon Musk , David O. Sacks , Tucker Carlson , and Peter Thiel , who first introduced Trump to Vance in 2021.

[ 101 ] [ 102 ] The Heritage Foundation , which drafted Project 2025 , privately advocated for Vance.

[ 103 ] Musk responded to Trump's vice-presidential pick hours after its announcement, saying the ticket "resounds with victory". David Sacks, a prominent GOP donor and Silicon Valley venture capitalist, wrote on Twitter: "This is who I want by Trump's side: an American patriot." In 2022, Sacks gave a super PAC supporting Vance's Senate campaign $900,000, and Thiel added $15 million.

[ 104 ] It was initially reported that Musk would contribute $45 million monthly to the Trump-Vance campaign, [ 105 ] but Musk later said he planned to donate "much lower amounts".

[ 106 ] [ 107 ] On May 15, 2024, Trump attended a $50,000 per head private fundraising dinner with Vance in Cincinnati .

[ 108 ] Guests included Chris Bortz and Republican fundraiser Nate Morris .

[ 109 ] Vance appeared at significant conservative political events and in June was described as a potential running mate for Trump.

[ 110 ] [ 111 ] In July, a former friend of Vance's from Yale Law School exposed to the media communications between them and Vance from 2014 to 2017, with the friend alleging that Vance has "changed [his] opinion on literally every imaginable issue that affects everyday Americans" in pursuit of "political power and wealth".

[ 112 ] [ 113 ] In late July 2024, after President Joe Biden withdrew his candidacy for reelection and Vice President Kamala Harris became a presidential candidate , Vance said at a private fundraiser that the "bad news is that Kamala Harris does not have the same baggage as Joe Biden ... Kamala Harris is obviously not struggling in the same ways that Joe Biden did"; a day later, Vance told the media: "I don't think the political calculus changes at all" whether Harris or Biden was the Democratic nominee.

[ 114 ] Following criticism of his past remarks and political positions, Vance said in an August 2024 interview that a vice president "doesn't really matter" and that "Kamala Harris has been a bad vice president".

[ 115 ] This came after Trump said that the "vice president, in terms of the election, does not have any impact".

[ 115 ] In late August, after the Trump campaign was embroiled in controversy for allegedly bringing cameras into a restricted area of Arlington National Cemetery during Trump's visit there, Vance first said that Harris "can go to hell" because "she wants to yell at Donald Trump because he showed up", and then said "Don't do this fake outrage thing". At the time of his comments, Harris had not publicly discussed the incident .

[ 116 ] [ 117 ] [ 118 ] Vance, Trump, former New York City Mayor Bloomberg , President Biden , and Vice President Harris at the National September 11 Memorial event in New York City on September 11, 2024 In August 2024, Vance said that Trump "said that explicitly that he would" veto a national abortion ban.

[ 119 ] In September 2024, during his debate with Harris, Trump was asked about Vance's statement about the veto, and responded: "I didn't discuss it with JD ... I think he was speaking for me—but I really didn't." [ 120 ] [ 121 ] In late September 2024, Vance spoke at a western Pennsylvania town hall event organized by Lance Wallnau , who has promoted election denialism and called Kamala Harris a "demon".

[ 122 ] [ 123 ] [ 124 ] In October 2024, Vance said he did not believe Trump lost the 2020 presidential election and that he believed "Big Tech rigged the election" through censorship.

[ 125 ] Comments on childlessness "Childless cat ladies" redirects here. For the archetype, see Cat lady .

Shortly after being named Trump's running mate, Vance was criticized for saying in a 2021 Fox News interview, "we are effectively run in this country via the Democrats, via our corporate oligarchs, by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable too." [ 126 ] The resurfaced comments, which were posted by MeidasTouch editor-in-chief Ron Filipkowski , sparked an immediate backlash across news and social media.

[ 127 ] [ 128 ] On July 26, 2024, Vance clarified his remarks on The Megyn Kelly Show , saying, "It's not a criticism of people who don't have children" and "this is about criticizing the Democratic Party for becoming anti-family and anti-child".

[ 129 ] He has said that being "pro-babies and pro-family" should be the Republican Party's highest priority.

[ 130 ] After backlash to the Fox News interview, additional comments that Vance had made in interviews about childless people resurfaced. In a 2020 podcast interview, he said that being childless "makes people more sociopathic and ultimately our whole country a little bit less, less mentally stable".

[ 131 ] Vance's campaign referred to "radical childless leaders in this country" in a fundraising email sent after his appearance on Tucker Carlson Tonight . CNN found multiple examples of Vance making similarly disparaging remarks about childless people, primarily Democratic officials.

[ 132 ] In a 2021 speech at a Center for Christian Virtue leadership meeting, Vance said that childless teachers were "trying to brainwash the minds of our children" and criticized American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten , saying: "If she wants to brainwash and destroy the minds of children, she should have some of her own and leave ours the hell alone." [ 133 ] He also suggested in a March 2021 interview on The Charlie Kirk Show that childless people should be taxed at a higher rate than those with children, adding that the U.S. should "reward the things that we think are good" and "punish the things that we think are bad".

[ 134 ] In an August 2024 interview on Face the Nation , Vance said he supported increasing the child tax credit from $2,000 per child to $5,000 per child, even though his Senate Republican colleagues had blocked an expanded child tax credit two weeks earlier while he was absent for the vote, having called it a "show vote" and saying it would not have passed even if he had been present.

[ 135 ] [ 136 ] Comments on Haitian immigrants Main article: Springfield pet-eating hoax In September 2024, Vance made allegations of "Haitian illegal immigrants draining social services and generally causing chaos all over Springfield, Ohio . Reports now show that people have had their pets abducted and eaten by people who shouldn't be in this country". Trump subsequently echoed the allegations, including during a presidential debate . Springfield authorities said there were "no credible reports or specific claims" of such incidents and that "Haitian immigrants are here legally".

[ 137 ] [ 138 ] Vance then said that it was "possible, of course, that all of these rumors will turn out to be false", but also told his supporters to "keep the cat memes flowing".

[ 139 ] He then promoted conservative activist Christopher Rufo 's allegation that African migrants were eating cats in Dayton, Ohio ; Dayton authorities reported "no evidence to even remotely suggest that any group, including our immigrant community, is engaged in eating pets".

[ 140 ] [ 141 ] After Vance's claim about Haitians eating pets was disputed, he said: "Do you know what's confirmed? That a child was murdered by a Haitian migrant who had no right to be here"; the child had actually died in an accidental collision between vehicles in Springfield, and the child's father criticized Vance for using the child's "death for political gain".

[ 142 ] [ 143 ] Vance also alleged a "massive rise in communicable diseases" in Springfield, but Clark County 's health commissioner reported having "not seen a substantial increase in all reportable communicable diseases".

[ 144 ] After Vance's and Trump's allegations, Springfield experienced multiple bomb threats in September. Vance denounced "violence or the threat of violence levied against Springfield", but continued his allegations against immigrants there.

[ 145 ] He defended his claims about Haitian migrants eating cats, saying that he was willing "to create stories so that the American media actually pays attention ... we're creating a story, meaning we're creating the American media focusing on it." [ 146 ] Vice-presidential debate Main article: 2024 United States presidential debates These paragraphs are an excerpt from 2024 United States presidential debates § October 1: Vice presidential debate (CBS, New York City) .

[ edit ] The vice presidential debate was held on Tuesday, October 1, 2024, at 9:00 p.m. EDT at the CBS Broadcast Center in New York City.

[ 147 ] CBS stated in late September that the moderators would not fact-check the candidates during the debate, with fact-checking instead handled online and on-air only after the debate.

[ 148 ] When Vance was fact checked on the status of Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio , he objected saying, "The rules were that you were not going to fact check", and argued that the immigrants should not be considered legal because the federal government decided their protected status after they had arrived in the United States.

[ 149 ] Walz rejected Vance's argument, and the microphones were muted as Vance continued speaking.

[ 150 ] Nielsen Media Research reported that 43 million viewers across CBS and 15 other television networks watched the debate, down from 57 million viewers during the 2020 vice presidential debate.

[ 151 ] Opinion polls Trump, Vance, and their families on stage at the 2024 Republican National Convention In July 2024, a CNN poll analysis after the Republican National Convention showed a net-negative approval rating for Vance.

[ 80 ] That week, Vance's middling public reception and other concerns led some prominent Republican politicians and political analysts to say that he may have been a poor choice of running mate, especially in light of the shift in the election's dynamics upon the withdrawal of President Biden from the election and advent of Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee.

[ 152 ] After the October 2024 vice-presidential debate, A CBS News/ YouGov poll of 1,630 likely debate viewers found Vance's favorability rose from 40% to 49%, while Walz's increased from 52% to 60%. Both candidates' unfavorability ratings also declined, with Vance's dropping from 54% to 47% and Walz's falling from 41% to 35%. The poll had a margin of error of 2.7 points.

[ 153 ] As of February 20, 2025, according to FiveThirtyEight , Vance's overall favorability was 40.7% and his unfavorability was 42.5%.

[ 154 ] Vice presidency (2025–present) Main article: Vice presidency of JD Vance See also: Second inauguration of Donald Trump and Second presidency of Donald Trump Vance being sworn in as vice president by Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh on January 20, 2025 At noon on January 20, 2025, Vance became the 50th vice president of the United States, sworn into the office by Justice Brett Kavanaugh .

[ 155 ] Before his inauguration, he held a meeting with China's vice president Han Zheng in which they discussed China–United States relations .

[ 156 ] Vance is the third-youngest person to serve as vice president , the second Catholic vice president after Joe Biden, and the first from the Millennial generation . He is also the first Marine Corps veteran to serve as vice president.

[ 157 ] Among Vance's first acts as vice president was swearing in Secretary of State Marco Rubio , the first of Trump's cabinet nominees to be approved by Congress, on January 21.

[ 158 ] On January 24, he cast the tie-breaking vote to confirm Pete Hegseth as Secretary of Defense .

[ 159 ] In February 2025, after multiple federal judges issued temporary rulings against various Trump administration actions, Vance wrote, "judges aren't allowed to control the executive's legitimate power".

[ 160 ] Usha and JD Vance at Pituffik Space Base in Greenland , March 2025 In a first for a sitting U.S. vice president, in March 2025 Vance visited Greenland , where he said "We can't just ignore the president's desires" for the U.S. to acquire Greenland.

[ 161 ] He also warned that Greenland faced the "encroachment of powerful countries" China and Russia "as they expand their ambitions", while declaring in a "message to Denmark " that "you have not done a good job". Vance criticized Denmark for having "underinvested in the security architecture" and "people of Greenland".

[ 161 ] [ 162 ] The next month, Vance lamented that the "globalist economy" had caused the United States to "borrow money from Chinese peasants to buy the things those Chinese peasants manufacture".

[ 163 ] Munich Security Conference Vance's speech at the 61st Munich Security Conference Main article: 2025 JD Vance speech at the Munich Security Conference In his February 2025 speech at the Munich Security Conference (MSC), partially due to what he said were examples in Romania, England, Scotland, and Germany, Vance called "the threat from within" his biggest concern in terms of security for Europe, "not Russia, not China".

[ 164 ] Several media outlets regarded the speech as a turning point in European Union–United States relations along with President Trump's telephone conversation with President of Russia Vladimir Putin . Some called it a declaration of "ideological war" [ 165 ] and " culture war " against the United States' European allies, and a "wrecking ball" to the decades-long status quo of transatlantic relations.

[ 166 ] [ 167 ] Zelenskyy White House visit Main article: 2025 Trump–Zelenskyy Oval Office meeting On February 28, 2025, Vance and Trump met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the White House's Oval Office in front of journalists in an internationally broadcast event.

[ 168 ] [ 169 ] Vance was mostly quiet for the meeting's first 40 minutes, but then interjected to answer a question about Trump's relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

[ 168 ] [ 170 ] Vance told Zelenskyy: "The path to peace and the path to prosperity is maybe engaging in diplomacy ... What makes America a good country is America engaging in diplomacy. That's what President Trump is doing." [ 170 ] Zelenskyy responded that Putin had not abided by a ceasefire and prisoner exchange agreement with Ukraine, and asked Vance, "What kind of diplomacy, JD, you are speaking about?" [ 171 ] Vance sitting next to Secretary of State Marco Rubio during the meeting The conversation became hostile; Vance replied that he was discussing "diplomacy that's going to end the destruction of" Ukraine, telling Zelenskyy: "it's disrespectful for you to come to the Oval Office and try to litigate this in front of the American media. Right now, you guys are going around and forcing conscripts to the front lines because you have manpower problems. You should be thanking the president for trying to bring an end to this conflict." [ 169 ] [ 170 ] Zelenskyy asked whether Vance had ever visited Ukraine; Vance replied that had "watched and seen the stories" about Ukraine, accusing Zelenskyy of showing a "propaganda tour" of Ukraine.

[ 169 ] [ 172 ] He asked whether Zelenskyy had ever offered thanks, despite Zelenskyy starting the conversation by saying "Thank you so much" to Trump.

[ 173 ] Vance falsely said Zelenskyy "went to Pennsylvania and campaigned for the opposition in October" 2024; Zelenskyy had actually visited a factory to thank workers producing ammunition for Ukraine, [ 174 ] though the timing of the visit and separately calling Vance "too radical" raised suspicion among Republicans.

[ 175 ] After the meeting, Zelenskyy and his delegation were made to leave the White House, canceling the original plan to sign a minerals deal between Ukraine and the U.S.

[ edit ] JD Vance speaking at the 2024 People's Convention The 50th vice president of the United States , JD Vance, has been described as a national conservative , [ 176 ] [ 177 ] right-wing populist , [ 176 ] [ 178 ] and an ideological successor to paleoconservatives such as Pat Buchanan .

[ 179 ] Vance describes himself, and has been described by others, as a member of the postliberal right.

[ 180 ] [ 181 ] [ 182 ] [ 183 ] Vance has described himself as having been influenced by Catholic social teaching .

[ 184 ] He has endorsed books by Kevin Roberts , president of the Heritage Foundation , and far-right conspiracy theorist Jack Posobiec .

[ 185 ] [ 186 ] On social issues, Vance is considered conservative .

[ 187 ] He opposes abortion , [ 188 ] [ 189 ] same-sex marriage , [ 187 ] and gun control .

[ 190 ] [ 191 ] [ 192 ] He has taken a number of natalist positions. He has repeatedly expressed his belief that childlessness is linked to sociopathy . Vance has repeatedly asserted that parents should have more voting power than non-parents; [ 193 ] [ 194 ] however, in August 2024, he backtracked from that suggestion.

[ 195 ] He has proposed federal criminalization of gender-affirming care for minors .

[ 196 ] He supports Israel in the Gaza war .

[ 197 ] He opposes continued American military aid to Ukraine during the ongoing Russian invasion and prefers a negotiated peace .

[ 198 ] [ 199 ] [ 200 ] Vance has argued that the country's largest and most powerful institutions have united against the right and has called for "a de- woke -ification program".

[ 201 ] [ 202 ] He is critical of universities, which he has called "the enemy".

[ 203 ] Vance is also critical of both the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation .

[ 204 ] In 2016, Vance was an outspoken critic of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump , calling him "reprehensible" and himself a " never Trump guy".

[ 205 ] [ 206 ] In 2021, after Vance announced his Senate candidacy , he publicly announced support for Trump, apologizing for his past criticisms of Trump and deleting some of them.

[ 207 ] [ 208 ] That year, Vance advised Trump to fire all civil servants and replace them with Trump supporters.

[ 209 ] Vance has said that if he had been vice president during the 2020 presidential election , he would not have certified the results. Instead, Vance insisted that some states that Trump lost should have sent pro-Trump electors to Washington so that Congress could decide the election .

[ 210 ] Personal life Vance wrote in his memoir, Hillbilly Elegy , that he was raised in a low-income family by his single mother and grandmother.

[ 8 ] [ 211 ] In 2013, Vance met Usha Chilukuri while both were students at Yale Law School.

[ 212 ] On June 14, 2014, they married in Kentucky in an interfaith marriage ceremony; [ 213 ] [ 214 ] she is Hindu and he is Christian.

[ 213 ] [ 215 ] The wedding included a Bible reading by Vance's "best friend", Jamil Jivani , [ 56 ] [ 216 ] and the bride and groom were blessed by a Hindu pandit .

[ 212 ] [ 217 ] Usha clerked for a year for Brett Kavanaugh , at the time an appeals court judge in Washington, then clerked for Chief Justice John Roberts for a year.

[ 218 ] JD and Usha Vance have three children.

[ 217 ] They own over 100 acres of land in Kentucky .

[ 14 ] Vance was raised in a "conservative, evangelical " branch of Protestantism .

[ 219 ] Vance has described that at the time he entered college, he was an atheist .

[ 220 ] By September 2016, he was "not an active participant" in any particular Christian denomination, but was "thinking very seriously about converting to Catholicism".

[ 219 ] In August 2019, Vance was baptized and confirmed in the Catholic Church in a ceremony at St. Gertrude Priory in Cincinnati , Ohio. He chose Augustine of Hippo as his confirmation saint . Vance said he converted because he "became persuaded over time that Catholicism was true [...] and Augustine gave me a way to understand Christian faith in a strongly intellectual way", further describing Catholic theology 's alignment with his political views.

[ 221 ] [ 222 ] [ 223 ] Vance was influenced to convert to Catholicism by Peter Thiel .

[ 224 ] He was criticized by Pope Francis for supporting deportation of migrants and responded by evoking the traditional concept of ordo amoris present in Catholic theology , which he interprets as loving his own nationals more than foreigners [ 225 ] and equates with the slogan " America First ".

[ 226 ] [ 227 ] [ 228 ] Nate Vance , JD's cousin and a U.S. Marine Corps veteran, volunteered to fight for Ukraine in 2022 after Russia's invasion. He served in the " Da Vinci Wolves " unit, fighting in major battles like Kupiansk and Bakhmut . In 2025, Nate criticized JD's stance on Ukraine, accusing him and Trump of aiding Russia. Nate expressed disappointment that JD, despite their family connection, didn't consult him for insights on the war.
