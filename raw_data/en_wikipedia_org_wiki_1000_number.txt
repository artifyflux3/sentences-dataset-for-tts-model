1000 or one thousand is the natural number following 999 and preceding 1001 . In most English-speaking countries , it can be written with or without a comma or sometimes a period separating the thousands digit : 1,000 .

A group of one thousand units is sometimes known, from Ancient Greek , as a chiliad .

[ 1 ] A period of one thousand years may be known as a chiliad or, more often from Latin , as a millennium . The number 1000 is also sometimes described as a short thousand in medieval contexts where it is necessary to distinguish the Germanic concept of 1200 as a long thousand . It is the first 4-digit integer .

Notation [ edit ] The decimal representation for one thousand is 1000 —a one followed by three zeros , in the general notation; 1 × 10 3 —in engineering notation , which for this number coincides with: 1 × 10 3 exactly—in scientific normalized exponential notation ; 1 E+3 exactly—in scientific E notation .

The SI prefix for a thousand units is " kilo- ", abbreviated to "k"—for instance, a kilogram or "kg" is a thousand grams . This is sometimes extended to non-SI contexts, such as "ka" ( kiloannum ) being used as a shorthand for periods of 1000 years. In computer science , however, "kilo-" is used more loosely to mean 2 to the 10th power (1024).

In the SI writing style , a non-breaking space can be used as a thousands separator , i.e., to separate the digits of a number at every power of 1000.

Multiples of thousands are occasionally represented by replacing their last three zeros with the letter "K" or "k": for instance, writing "$30k" for $30 000 or using "Y2K" to denote the Year 2000 computer problem .

A thousand units of currency , especially dollars or pounds , are colloquially called a grand . In the United States, this is sometimes abbreviated with a "G" suffix.

In mathematics [ edit ] A chiliagon is a 1000-sided polygon .
