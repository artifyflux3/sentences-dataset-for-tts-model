[ 1 ] It is an approach to the analysis of legal questions characterized by abstract logical reasoning focusing on the applicable legal text, such as a constitution , legislation , or case law , rather than on the social , economic , or political context. Legalism has occurred both in civil and common law traditions. It underlines both natural law and legal positivism .

[ 2 ] In its narrower versions, legalism may endorse the notion that the preexisting body of authoritative legal materials already contains a uniquely predetermined right answer to any legal problem that may arise.

Legalism typically also claims that the task of the judge is to ascertain the answer to a legal question by an essentially mechanical process rather than some Schmittian modality of sovereignty .
