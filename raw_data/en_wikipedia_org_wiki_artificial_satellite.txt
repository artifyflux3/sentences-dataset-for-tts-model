Two [CubeSats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CubeSat "CubeSat") orbiting around [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth") after being deployed from the ISS [_Kibō_ module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kib%C5%8D_(ISS_module) "Kibō (ISS module)")'s Small Satellite Orbital Deployer

A **satellite** or an **artificial satellite**[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-1) is an object, typically a [spacecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft "Spacecraft"), placed into [orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit "Orbit") around a [celestial body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_object "Astronomical object"). They have a variety of uses, including communication relay, [weather forecasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_forecasting "Weather forecasting"), navigation ([GPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS "GPS")), [broadcasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcasting "Broadcasting"), scientific research, and Earth observation. Additional military uses are reconnaissance, [early warning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_warning_system "Early warning system"), signals intelligence and, potentially, weapon delivery. Other satellites include the final rocket stages that place satellites in orbit and formerly useful satellites that later become defunct.

Except for [passive satellites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_satellite "Passive satellite"), most satellites have an [electricity generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_generation "Electricity generation") system for equipment on board, such as [solar panels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_panel "Solar panel") or [radioisotope thermoelectric generators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioisotope_thermoelectric_generator "Radioisotope thermoelectric generator") (RTGs). Most satellites also have a method of communication to [ground stations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_station "Ground station"), called [transponders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transponder_(satellite_communications) "Transponder (satellite communications)"). Many satellites use a [standardized bus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_bus "Satellite bus") to save cost and work, the most popular of which are small [CubeSats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CubeSat "CubeSat"). Similar satellites can work together as groups, forming [constellations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_constellation "Satellite constellation"). Because of the high [launch cost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_cost "Launch cost") to space, most satellites are designed to be as lightweight and robust as possible. Most communication satellites are radio [relay stations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_relay_station "Broadcast relay station") in orbit and carry dozens of transponders, each with a bandwidth of tens of megahertz.

Spaceships become satellites by accelerating or decelerating to reach [orbital velocities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_angular_velocity "Orbital angular velocity"), occupying an orbit high enough to avoid [orbital decay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_decay "Orbital decay") due to [drag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_drag "Atmospheric drag") in the presence of an [atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere "Atmosphere") and above their [Roche limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roche_limit "Roche limit"). Satellites are spacecraft launched from the surface into space by [launch systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_system "Launch system"). Satellites can then change or maintain their orbit by [propulsion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft_propulsion "Spacecraft propulsion"), usually by [chemical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrusters_(spacecraft) "Thrusters (spacecraft)") or [ion thrusters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_thruster "Ion thruster"). As of 2018, about 90% of the satellites orbiting the Earth are in [low Earth orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit "Low Earth orbit") or [geostationary orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit "Geostationary orbit"); geostationary means the satellites stay still in the sky (relative to a fixed point on the ground). Some imaging satellites choose a [Sun-synchronous orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun-synchronous_orbit "Sun-synchronous orbit") because they can scan the entire globe with similar lighting. As the number of satellites and amount of [space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris "Space debris") around Earth increases, the threat of collision has become more severe. An **orbiter** is a spacecraft that is designed to perform an [orbital insertion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_insertion "Orbital insertion"), entering orbit around an astronomical body from another,[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-d979-2) and as such becoming an artificial satellite. A small number of satellites orbit other bodies (such as the [Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_orbit "Lunar orbit"), [Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Areocentric_orbit "Areocentric orbit"), and the [Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentric_orbit "Heliocentric orbit")) or many bodies at once (two for a [halo orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_orbit "Halo orbit"), three for a [Lissajous orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lissajous_orbit "Lissajous orbit")).

[Earth observation satellites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_observation_satellite "Earth observation satellite") gather information for [reconnaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconnaissance_satellite "Reconnaissance satellite"), [mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_imagery "Satellite imagery"), [monitoring the weather](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_satellite "Weather satellite"), ocean, forest, etc. [Space telescopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_telescope "Space telescope") take advantage of outer space's [near perfect vacuum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra-high_vacuum "Ultra-high vacuum") to observe objects with the entire [electromagnetic spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum "Electromagnetic spectrum"). Because satellites can see a large portion of the Earth at once, [communications satellites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_satellites "Communications satellites") can relay information to remote places. The signal delay from satellites and their orbit's predictability are used in [satellite navigation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_navigation "Satellite navigation") systems, such as GPS. [Crewed spacecrafts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crewed_spacecraft "Crewed spacecraft") which are in orbit or remain in orbit, like [Space stations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station "Space station"), are artificial satellites as well.

The first artificial satellite launched into the Earth's orbit was the [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union")'s [Sputnik 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik_1 "Sputnik 1"), on October 4, 1957. As of December 31, 2022, there are 6,718 operational satellites in the Earth's orbit, of which 4,529 belong to the United States (3,996 commercial), 590 belong to China, 174 belong to Russia, and 1,425 belong to other nations.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-3)

History
-------

### Early proposals

The first published mathematical study of the possibility of an artificial satellite was [Newton's cannonball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_cannonball "Newton's cannonball"), a thought experiment by [Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton") to explain the motion of [natural satellites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_satellite "Natural satellite"), in his _[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophi%C3%A6\_Naturalis\_Principia\_Mathematica "Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica")_ (1687). The first fictional depiction of a satellite being launched into orbit was a [short story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_story "Short story") by [Edward Everett Hale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Everett_Hale "Edward Everett Hale"), "[The Brick Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brick_Moon "The Brick Moon")" (1869).[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-4)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-5) The idea surfaced again in [Jules Verne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_Verne "Jules Verne")'s _[The Begum's Fortune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Begum%27s\_Fortune "The Begum's Fortune")_ (1879).

In 1903, [Konstantin Tsiolkovsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konstantin_Tsiolkovsky "Konstantin Tsiolkovsky") (1857–1935) published _Exploring Space Using Jet Propulsion Devices_, which was the first academic treatise on the use of rocketry to launch spacecraft. He calculated the [orbital speed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_speed "Orbital speed") required for a minimal orbit, and inferred that a [multi-stage rocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-stage_rocket "Multi-stage rocket") fueled by liquid [propellants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propellant "Propellant") could achieve this.

[Herman Potočnik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_Poto%C4%8Dnik "Herman Potočnik") explored the idea of using orbiting spacecraft for detailed peaceful and military observation of the ground in his 1928 book, _The Problem of Space Travel_. He described how the special conditions of space could be useful for scientific experiments. The book described [geostationary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary "Geostationary") satellites (first put forward by [Konstantin Tsiolkovsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konstantin_Tsiolkovsky "Konstantin Tsiolkovsky")) and discussed the communication between them and the ground using radio, but fell short with the idea of using satellites for mass broadcasting and as telecommunications relays.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-6)

In a 1945 _[Wireless World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless\_World "Wireless World")_ article, English science fiction writer [Arthur C. Clarke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_C._Clarke "Arthur C. Clarke") described in detail the possible use of [communications satellites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_satellite "Communications satellite") for mass communications. He suggested that three geostationary satellites would provide coverage over the entire planet.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-:0-7): 1–2

In May 1946, the [United States Air Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force "United States Air Force")'s [Project RAND](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_RAND "Project RAND") released the [Preliminary Design of an Experimental World-Circling Spaceship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preliminary_Design_of_an_Experimental_World-Circling_Spaceship "Preliminary Design of an Experimental World-Circling Spaceship"), which stated "A satellite vehicle with appropriate instrumentation can be expected to be one of the most potent scientific tools of the Twentieth Century."[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-8) The United States had been considering launching orbital satellites since 1945 under the [Bureau of Aeronautics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Aeronautics "Bureau of Aeronautics") of the [United States Navy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy "United States Navy"). Project RAND eventually released the report, but considered the satellite to be a tool for science, politics, and propaganda, rather than a potential military weapon.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-9)

In 1946, American theoretical astrophysicist [Lyman Spitzer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyman_Spitzer "Lyman Spitzer") proposed an orbiting [space telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_telescope "Space telescope").[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-10)

In February 1954, Project RAND released "Scientific Uses for a Satellite Vehicle", by R. R. Carhart.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-11) This expanded on potential scientific uses for satellite vehicles and was followed in June 1955 with "The Scientific Use of an Artificial Satellite", by H. K. Kallmann and W. W. Kellogg.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-12)

### First satellites

[![Image 2: Steel ball with 4 antennas](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/Sputnik_asm.jpg/250px-Sputnik_asm.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sputnik_asm.jpg)

Replica of the [Sputnik 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik_1 "Sputnik 1")

The first artificial satellite was [Sputnik 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik_1 "Sputnik 1"), launched by the [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union") on 4 October 1957 under the [Sputnik program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik_program "Sputnik program"), with [Sergei Korolev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Korolev "Sergei Korolev") as chief designer. Sputnik 1 helped to identify the density of high [atmospheric layers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_atmosphere#Temperature_and_layers "Earth's atmosphere") through measurement of its orbital change and provided data on radio-signal distribution in the [ionosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere "Ionosphere"). The unanticipated announcement of Sputnik 1's success precipitated the [Sputnik crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik_crisis "Sputnik crisis") in the United States and ignited the so-called Space Race within the [Cold War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War "Cold War").

In the context of activities planned for the [International Geophysical Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Geophysical_Year "International Geophysical Year") (1957–1958), the [White House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House "White House") announced on 29 July 1955 that the U.S. intended to launch satellites by the spring of 1958. This became known as [Project Vanguard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Vanguard "Project Vanguard"). On 31 July, the Soviet Union announced its intention to launch a satellite by the fall of 1957.

[Sputnik 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik_2 "Sputnik 2") was launched on 3 November 1957 and carried the first living passenger into orbit, a dog named [Laika](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laika "Laika").[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-nasa_animals-13) The dog was sent without possibility of return.

In early 1955, after being pressured by the [American Rocket Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Rocket_Society "American Rocket Society"), the [National Science Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Science_Foundation "National Science Foundation"), and the International Geophysical Year, the Army and Navy worked on [Project Orbiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Orbiter "Project Orbiter") with two competing programs. The army used the [Jupiter C rocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter-C_IRBM "Jupiter-C IRBM"), while the civilian–Navy program used the [Vanguard rocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanguard_(rocket) "Vanguard (rocket)") to launch a satellite. [Explorer 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explorer_1 "Explorer 1") became the United States' first artificial satellite, on 31 January 1958.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-14) The information sent back from its radiation detector led to the discovery of the Earth's [Van Allen radiation belts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Allen_radiation_belt "Van Allen radiation belt").[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-Allen-15) The [TIROS-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIROS-1 "TIROS-1") spacecraft, launched on April 1, 1960, as part of NASA's [Television Infrared Observation Satellite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_Infrared_Observation_Satellite "Television Infrared Observation Satellite") (TIROS) program, sent back the first television footage of weather patterns to be taken from space.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-Tatem-16)

In June 1961, three and a half years after the launch of Sputnik 1, the [United States Space Surveillance Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Space_Surveillance_Network "United States Space Surveillance Network") cataloged 115 Earth-orbiting satellites.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-17)

While Canada was the third country to build a satellite which was launched into space,[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-18) it was launched aboard an [American](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States") rocket from an American spaceport. The same goes for Australia, whose launch of the first satellite involved a donated U.S. [Redstone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGM-11_Redstone "PGM-11 Redstone") rocket and American support staff as well as a joint launch facility with the United Kingdom.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-19) The first Italian satellite [San Marco 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Marco_1 "San Marco 1") was launched on 15 December 1964 on a U.S. [Scout rocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scout_rocket "Scout rocket") from [Wallops Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallops_Island "Wallops Island") (Virginia, United States) with an Italian launch team trained by [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA "NASA").[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-20) In similar occasions, almost all further first national satellites were launched by foreign rockets.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

France was the third country to launch a satellite on its own rocket. On 26 November 1965, the [Astérix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ast%C3%A9rix_(satellite) "Astérix (satellite)") or A-1 (initially conceptualized as FR.2 or FR-2), was put into orbit by a [Diamant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamant "Diamant") A rocket launched from the CIEES site at [Hammaguir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammaguir "Hammaguir"), [Algeria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria "Algeria"). With Astérix, France became the sixth country to have an artificial satellite.

### Later Satellite Development

Early satellites were built to unique designs. With advancements in technology, multiple satellites began to be built on [single model platforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_satellite_buses "Comparison of satellite buses") called [satellite buses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_bus "Satellite bus"). The first standardized satellite bus design was the [HS-333](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HS-333 "HS-333")[geosynchronous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geosynchronous_orbit "Geosynchronous orbit") (GEO) [communication satellite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_satellite "Communication satellite") launched in 1972. Beginning in 1997, [FreeFlyer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeFlyer "FreeFlyer") is a commercial off-the-shelf software application for satellite mission analysis, design, and operations.

After the late 2010s, and especially after the advent and operational fielding of large [satellite internet constellations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_internet_constellation "Satellite internet constellation")—where on-orbit active satellites more than doubled over a period of five years—the companies building the constellations began to propose regular planned deorbiting of the older satellites that reached the [end of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-of-life_(product) "End-of-life (product)"), as a part of the [regulatory process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_authority "Regulatory authority") of obtaining a launch license.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] The largest artificial satellite ever is the [International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station "International Space Station").[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-21)

By the early 2000s, and particularly after the advent of [CubeSats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CubeSat "CubeSat") and increased launches of [microsats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsatellite_(spaceflight) "Microsatellite (spaceflight)")—frequently launched to the lower altitudes of [low Earth orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit "Low Earth orbit") (LEO)—satellites began to more frequently be designed to get destroyed, or breakup and burnup entirely in the atmosphere.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-22) For example, [SpaceX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX "SpaceX")[Starlink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink "Starlink") satellites, the first large satellite internet constellation to exceed 1000 active satellites on orbit in 2020, are designed to be 100% demisable and burn up completely on their atmospheric reentry at the end of their life, or in the event of an early satellite failure.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-tasia202104-23)

In different periods, many countries, such as [Algeria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria "Algeria"), [Argentina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina "Argentina"), [Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia "Australia"), [Austria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria "Austria"), [Brazil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil "Brazil"), [Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada "Canada"), [Chile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile "Chile"), [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China "China"), [Denmark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark "Denmark"), [Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt "Egypt"), [Finland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland "Finland"), [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France "France"), [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany "Germany"), [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India "India"), [Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran "Iran"), [Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel "Israel"), [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy "Italy"), [Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan "Japan"), [Kazakhstan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakhstan "Kazakhstan"), [South Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea "South Korea"), [Malaysia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia "Malaysia"), [Mexico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico "Mexico"), the [Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands "Netherlands"), [Norway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway "Norway"), [Pakistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan "Pakistan"), [Poland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland "Poland"), [Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia "Russia"), [Saudi Arabia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia "Saudi Arabia"), [South Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa "South Africa"), [Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain "Spain"), [Switzerland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland "Switzerland"), [Thailand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand "Thailand"), [Turkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey "Turkey"), [Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine "Ukraine"), the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom "United Kingdom") and the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States"), had some satellites in orbit.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-24)

Japan's space agency (JAXA) and [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA "NASA") plan to send a wooden satellite prototype called LingoSat into orbit in the summer of 2024. They have been working on this project for few years and sent first wood samples to the space in 2021 to test the material's resilience to space conditions.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-25)

### Orbit and altitude control

"Altitude control" redirects here; not to be confused with [Attitude control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_control "Attitude control").

[![Image 3](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Ion_Engine_Test_Firing_-_GPN-2000-000482.jpg/250px-Ion_Engine_Test_Firing_-_GPN-2000-000482.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ion_Engine_Test_Firing_-_GPN-2000-000482.jpg)

Firing of _[Deep Space 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep\_Space\_1 "Deep Space 1")_'s ion thruster

Most satellites use chemical or [ion propulsion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_propulsion "Ion propulsion") to [adjust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_maneuver "Orbital maneuver") or [maintain their orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_station-keeping "Orbital station-keeping"),[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-:0-7): 78  coupled with [reaction wheels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_wheel "Reaction wheel") to control their [three axis of rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_principal_axes "Aircraft principal axes") or attitude. Satellites close to Earth are affected the most by variations in the [Earth's magnetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_magnetic_field "Earth's magnetic field"), [gravitational field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_of_Earth "Gravity of Earth") and the Sun's [radiation pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_pressure "Radiation pressure"); satellites that are further away are affected more by other bodies' gravitational field by the Moon and the Sun. Satellites utilize ultra-white reflective coatings to prevent damage from UV radiation.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-26) Without orbit and orientation control, satellites in orbit will not be able to communicate with [ground stations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_station "Ground station") on the Earth.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-:0-7): 75–76

Chemical thrusters on satellites usually use [monopropellant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopropellant "Monopropellant") (one-part) or [bipropellant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipropellant "Bipropellant") (two-parts) that are [hypergolic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergolic_propellant "Hypergolic propellant"). Hypergolic means able to combust spontaneously when in contact with each other or to a [catalyst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalysis "Catalysis"). The most commonly used propellant mixtures on satellites are [hydrazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrazine "Hydrazine")-based monopropellants or [monomethylhydrazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomethylhydrazine "Monomethylhydrazine")–[dinitrogen tetroxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinitrogen_tetroxide "Dinitrogen tetroxide") bipropellants. Ion thrusters on satellites usually are [Hall-effect thrusters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall-effect_thruster "Hall-effect thruster"), which generate thrust by accelerating [positive ions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_ions "Positive ions") through a negatively-charged grid. Ion propulsion is more efficient propellant-wise than chemical propulsion but its thrust is very small (around 0.5 N or 0.1 lb f), and thus requires a longer burn time. The thrusters usually use [xenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenon "Xenon") because it is [inert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inert_gas "Inert gas"), can be easily [ionized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionized "Ionized"), has a high [atomic mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_mass "Atomic mass") and storable as a high-pressure liquid.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-:0-7): 78–79

### Power

The [International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station "International Space Station")'s black solar panels on the left and white [radiators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiator "Radiator") on the right

Most satellites use [solar panels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_panels_on_spacecraft "Solar panels on spacecraft") to generate power, and a few in deep space with limited sunlight use [radioisotope thermoelectric generators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioisotope_thermoelectric_generator "Radioisotope thermoelectric generator"). [Slip rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slip_ring "Slip ring") attach solar panels to the satellite; the slip rings can rotate to be perpendicular with the sunlight and generate the most power. All satellites with a solar panel must also have [batteries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batteries_in_space "Batteries in space"), because sunlight is blocked inside the launch vehicle and at night. The most common types of batteries for satellites are [lithium-ion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium-ion_battery "Lithium-ion battery"), and in the past [nickel–hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel-hydrogen_batteries "Nickel-hydrogen batteries").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-:0-7): 88–89

Applications
------------

### Earth observation

[![Image 5](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/Earth_Radiation_Budget_Satellite.jpg/250px-Earth_Radiation_Budget_Satellite.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Earth_Radiation_Budget_Satellite.jpg)

Deployment of the [Earth Radiation Budget Satellite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_Radiation_Budget_Satellite "Earth Radiation Budget Satellite") on [STS-41-G](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-41-G "STS-41-G"), collecting data on Earth's weather and climate

Earth observation satellites are designed to monitor and survey the Earth, called [remote sensing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_sensing "Remote sensing"). Most Earth observation satellites are placed in low Earth orbit for a high data resolution, though some are placed in a [geostationary orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit "Geostationary orbit") for an uninterrupted coverage. Some satellites are placed in a [Sun-synchronous orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun-synchronous_orbit "Sun-synchronous orbit") to have consistent lighting and obtain a total view of the Earth. Depending on the satellites' functions, they might have a [normal camera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_imagery "Satellite imagery"), [radar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_radar "Space-based radar"), [lidar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidar "Lidar"), [photometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photometer "Photometer"), or atmospheric instruments. Earth observation satellite's data is most used in [archaeology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeology "Archaeology"), [cartography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartography "Cartography"), [environmental monitoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_monitoring "Environmental monitoring"), [meteorology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology "Meteorology"), and [reconnaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconnaissance "Reconnaissance") applications.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] As of 2021, there are over 950 Earth observation satellites, with the largest number of satellites operated with [Planet Labs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_Labs "Planet Labs").[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-27)

[Weather satellites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_satellite "Weather satellite") monitor [clouds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud "Cloud"), [city lights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_light "Street light"), [fires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire "Fire"), effects of [pollution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution "Pollution"), [auroras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auroral_light "Auroral light"), [sand and dust storms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust_storm "Dust storm"), [snow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow "Snow") cover, [ice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice "Ice") mapping, boundaries of [ocean currents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_current "Ocean current"), [energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy "Energy") flows, etc. Environmental monitoring satellites can detect changes in the Earth's [vegetation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetation "Vegetation"), atmospheric trace gas content, sea state, ocean color, and ice fields. By monitoring vegetation changes over time, droughts can be monitored by comparing the current vegetation state to its long term average.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-28) Anthropogenic emissions can be monitored by evaluating data of tropospheric NO 2 and SO 2.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

### Communication

A [communications satellite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_satellite "Communications satellite") is an [artificial satellite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite "Artificial satellite") that relays and amplifies [radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio "Radio") telecommunication signals via a [transponder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transponder_(satellite_communications) "Transponder (satellite communications)"); it creates a [communication channel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_channel "Communication channel") between a source [transmitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmitter "Transmitter") and a [receiver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_receiver "Radio receiver") at different locations on [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth"). Communications satellites are used for [television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television "Television"), [telephone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone "Telephone"), [radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio "Radio"), [internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet "Internet"), and [military](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military "Military") applications.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-29) Some communications satellites are in [geostationary orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit "Geostationary orbit") 22,236 miles (35,785 km) above the [equator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equator "Equator"), so that the satellite appears stationary at the same point in the sky; therefore the [satellite dish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_dish "Satellite dish") antennas of ground stations can be aimed permanently at that spot and do not have to move to track the satellite. But most form [satellite constellations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_constellation "Satellite constellation") in [low Earth orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit "Low Earth orbit"), where antennas on the ground have to follow the position of the satellites and switch between satellites frequently.

The [radio waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_wave "Radio wave") used for telecommunications links travel by [line of sight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line-of-sight_propagation "Line-of-sight propagation") and so are obstructed by the curve of the Earth. The purpose of communications satellites is to relay the signal around the curve of the Earth allowing communication between widely separated geographical points.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-30) Communications satellites use a wide range of radio and [microwave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave "Microwave")[frequencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequencies "Frequencies"). To avoid signal interference, international organizations have regulations for which frequency ranges or "bands" certain organizations are allowed to use. This allocation of bands minimizes the risk of signal interference.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-Communications_satellite_aerospace.org-31)

### Spy satellites

When an Earth observation satellite or a communications satellite is deployed for military or intelligence purposes, it is known as a spy satellite or reconnaissance satellite.

Their uses include early missile warning, nuclear explosion detection, electronic reconnaissance, and optical or radar imaging surveillance.

### Navigation

Navigational satellites are satellites that use radio time signals transmitted to enable mobile receivers on the ground to determine their exact location. The relatively clear line of sight between the satellites and receivers on the ground, combined with ever-improving electronics, allows satellite navigation systems to measure location to accuracies on the order of a few meters in real time.

### Telescope

[![Image 6](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Hubble_Space_Telescope_%2827946391011%29.jpg/250px-Hubble_Space_Telescope_%2827946391011%29.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hubble_Space_Telescope_(27946391011).jpg)

The [Hubble Space Telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope "Hubble Space Telescope")

[Astronomical satellites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_satellite "Astronomical satellite") are satellites used for observation of distant planets, galaxies, and other outer space objects.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-32)

### Experimental

[Tether satellites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tether_satellite "Tether satellite") are satellites that are connected to another satellite by a thin cable called a [tether](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tether "Tether"). [Recovery satellites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recovery_satellite "Recovery satellite") are satellites that provide a recovery of reconnaissance, biological, space-production and other payloads from orbit to Earth. [Biosatellites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosatellite "Biosatellite") are satellites designed to carry living organisms, generally for scientific experimentation. [Space-based solar power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_solar_power "Space-based solar power") satellites are proposed satellites that would collect energy from sunlight and transmit it for use on Earth or other places.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

### Weapon

Since the mid-2000s, satellites have been hacked by militant organizations to broadcast propaganda and to pilfer classified information from military communication networks.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-33)[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-34) For testing purposes, satellites in low earth orbit have been destroyed by ballistic missiles launched from the Earth. [Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia "Russia"), [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States"), [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China "China") and [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India "India") have demonstrated the ability to eliminate satellites.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-asat-35) In 2007, the [Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China "China") military shot down an aging weather satellite,[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-asat-35) followed by the [US Navy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Navy "US Navy") shooting down a [defunct spy satellite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NRO_L-21 "NRO L-21") in February 2008.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-36) On 18 November 2015, after two failed attempts, Russia successfully carried out a flight test of an [anti-satellite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-satellite_weapon "Anti-satellite weapon") missile known as _[Nudol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-235\_anti-ballistic\_missile\_system "A-235 anti-ballistic missile system")_.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] On 27 March 2019, India shot down a live test satellite at 300 km altitude in 3 minutes, becoming the fourth country to have the capability to destroy live satellites.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-37)[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-38)

Environmental impact
--------------------

The environmental impact of satellites is not currently well understood as they were previously assumed to be benign due to the rarity of satellite launches. However, the exponential increase and projected growth of satellite launches are bringing the issue into consideration. The main issues are resource use and the release of pollutants into the atmosphere which can happen at different stages of a satellite's lifetime.

### Resource use

Resource use is difficult to monitor and quantify for satellites and [launch vehicles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_vehicle "Launch vehicle") due to their commercially sensitive nature. However, [aluminium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium "Aluminium") is a preferred metal in satellite construction due to its lightweight and relative cheapness and typically constitutes around 40% of a satellite's mass.[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-schulz-39) Through mining and refining, aluminium has numerous negative environmental impacts and is one of the most carbon-intensive metals.[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-40) Satellite manufacturing also requires rare elements such as [lithium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium "Lithium"), [gold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold "Gold"), and [gallium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallium "Gallium"), some of which have significant environmental consequences linked to their mining and processing and/or are in limited supply.[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-Gaston-41)[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-42)[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-43) Launch vehicles require larger amounts of raw materials to manufacture and the [booster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_(rocketry) "Booster (rocketry)") stages are usually dropped into the ocean after fuel exhaustion. They are not normally recovered.[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-Gaston-41) Two empty boosters used for [Ariane 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariane_5 "Ariane 5"), which were composed mainly of steel, weighed around 38 tons each,[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-44) to give an idea of the quantity of materials that are often left in the ocean.

### Launches

Rocket launches release numerous pollutants into every layer of the atmosphere, especially affecting the atmosphere above the [tropopause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropopause "Tropopause") where the byproducts of combustion can reside for extended periods.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-Durrieu-45) These pollutants can include [black carbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_carbon "Black carbon"), [CO 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide "Carbon dioxide"), [nitrogen oxides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOx "NOx") (NO x), [aluminium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium "Aluminium") and [water vapour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_vapour "Water vapour"), but the mix of pollutants is dependent on rocket design and fuel type.[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-46) The amount of [green house gases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas "Greenhouse gas") emitted by rockets is considered trivial as it contributes significantly less, around 0.01%,[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-47) than the aviation industry yearly which itself accounts for 2-3% of the total global greenhouse gas emissions.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-Durrieu-45)

Rocket emissions in the [stratosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratosphere "Stratosphere") and their effects are only beginning to be studied and it is likely that the impacts will be more critical than emissions in the troposphere.[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-Gaston-41) The stratosphere includes the [ozone layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone_layer "Ozone layer") and pollutants emitted from rockets can contribute to [ozone depletion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone_depletion "Ozone depletion") in a number of ways. [Radicals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry) "Radical (chemistry)") such as NO x, HO x, and ClO x deplete stratospheric O 3 through intermolecular reactions and can have huge impacts in trace amounts.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-Durrieu-45) However, it is currently understood that launch rates would need to increase by ten times to match the impact of regulated ozone-depleting substances.[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-Ryan-48)[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-Ross-49) Whilst emissions of water vapour are largely deemed as inert, H 2 O is the source gas for HO x and can also contribute to ozone loss through the formation of ice particles.[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-Ryan-48) Black carbon particles emitted by rockets can absorb solar radiation in the stratosphere and cause warming in the surrounding air which can then impact the circulatory dynamics of the stratosphere.[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-50) Both warming and changes in circulation can then cause depletion of the ozone layer.

### Operational

#### Low earth orbit satellites

Several pollutants are released in the upper atmospheric layers during the orbital lifetime of [LEO satellites.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit "Low Earth orbit")[Orbital decay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_decay "Orbital decay") is caused by atmospheric drag and to keep the satellite in the correct orbit the platform occasionally needs repositioning. To do this nozzle-based systems use a chemical propellant to create thrust. In most cases [hydrazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrazine "Hydrazine") is the chemical propellant used which then releases [ammonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonia "Ammonia"), [hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen "Hydrogen") and [nitrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen "Nitrogen") as gas into the upper atmosphere.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-Durrieu-45) Also, the environment of the outer atmosphere causes the degradation of exterior materials. The atomic oxygen in the upper atmosphere oxidises hydrocarbon-based polymers like [Kapton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kapton "Kapton"), [Teflon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teflon "Teflon") and [Mylar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BoPET "BoPET") that are used to insulate and protect the satellite which then emits gasses like CO 2 and CO into the atmosphere.[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-51)

#### Night sky

Given the current surge in satellites in the sky, soon hundreds of satellites may be clearly visible to the human eye at dark sites. It is estimated that the overall levels of diffuse brightness of the night skies has increased by up to 10% above natural levels.[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-52) This has the potential to confuse organisms, like insects and night-migrating birds, that use celestial patterns for migration and orientation.[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-53)[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-54) The impact this might have is currently unclear. The visibility of man-made objects in the night sky may also impact people's linkages with the world, nature, and culture.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-55)

#### Ground-based infrastructure

At all points of a satellite's lifetime, its movement and processes are monitored on the ground through a network of facilities. The environmental cost of the infrastructure as well as day-to-day operations is likely to be quite high,[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-Gaston-41) but quantification requires further investigation.

### Degeneration

Particular threats arise from uncontrolled de-orbit.

Some notable satellite failures that polluted and dispersed radioactive materials are [Kosmos 954](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosmos_954 "Kosmos 954"), [Kosmos 1402](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosmos_1402 "Kosmos 1402") and the [Transit 5-BN-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nuclear_power_systems_in_space "List of nuclear power systems in space").

When in a controlled manner satellites reach the end of life they are intentionally deorbited or moved to a [graveyard orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graveyard_orbit "Graveyard orbit") further away from Earth in order to reduce [space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris "Space debris"). Physical collection or removal is not economical or even currently possible. Moving satellites out to a graveyard orbit is also unsustainable because they remain there for hundreds of years.[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-Gaston-41) It will lead to the further pollution of space and future issues with space debris. When satellites deorbit much of it is destroyed during re-entry into the atmosphere due to the heat. This introduces more material and pollutants into the atmosphere.[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-schulz-39)[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-56) There have been concerns expressed about the potential damage to the ozone layer and the possibility of increasing the earth's [albedo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albedo "Albedo"), reducing warming but also resulting in accidental [geoengineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoengineering "Geoengineering") of the earth's climate.[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-Gaston-41) After deorbiting 70% of satellites end up in the ocean and are rarely recovered.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-Durrieu-45)

### Mitigation

Using wood as an alternative material has been posited in order to reduce pollution and debris from satellites that reenter the atmosphere.[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-57)

Interference

### Collision threat

The growth of all tracked objects in space over time[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-10.1038/s41550-022-01655-6-58)

[Space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris "Space debris") pose dangers to the spacecraft[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-59)[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-physUT-60) (including satellites)[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-physUT-60)[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-61) in or crossing geocentric orbits and have the potential to drive a [Kessler syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kessler_syndrome "Kessler syndrome")[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-62) which could potentially curtail humanity from conducting space endeavors in the future.[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-63)[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-64)

With increase in the number of [satellite constellations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_constellation "Satellite constellation"), like [SpaceX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX "SpaceX")[Starlink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink "Starlink"), the astronomical community, such as the [IAU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Astronomical_Union "International Astronomical Union"), report that orbital pollution is getting increased significantly.[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-iau-65)[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-66)[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-67)[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-68)[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-69) A report from the SATCON1 workshop in 2020 concluded that the effects of large satellite constellations can severely affect some astronomical research efforts and lists six ways to mitigate harm to astronomy.[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-70)[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-71) The IAU is establishing a center (CPS) to coordinate or aggregate measures to mitigate such detrimental effects.[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-72)[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-73)[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-74)

### Radio interference

Due to the low received signal strength of satellite transmissions, they are prone to [jamming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_jamming "Radio jamming") by land-based transmitters. Such jamming is limited to the geographical area within the transmitter's range. GPS satellites are potential targets for jamming,[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-75)[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-76) but satellite phone and television signals have also been subjected to jamming.[[76]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-77)[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-78)

Also, it is very easy to transmit a carrier radio signal to a geostationary satellite and thus interfere with the legitimate uses of the satellite's transponder. It is common for Earth stations to transmit at the wrong time or on the wrong frequency in commercial satellite space, and dual-illuminate the transponder, rendering the frequency unusable. Satellite operators now have sophisticated monitoring tools and methods that enable them to pinpoint the source of any carrier and manage the transponder space effectively.

Regulation
----------

Issues like [space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris "Space debris"), radio and [light pollution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_pollution "Light pollution") are increasing in magnitude and at the same time lack progress in national or international regulation.[[78]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-sp1-79)[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite#cite_note-10.1038/s41550-022-01655-6-58)
