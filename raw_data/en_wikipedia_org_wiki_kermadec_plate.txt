Also included on this tectonic plate is a small portion of the North Island of New Zealand and the Kermadec Islands . It is separated from the Australian plate by a long divergent boundary which forms a back-arc basin . This area is highly prone to earthquakes and tsunamis .

The Pacific plate east to west convergence rates with the Australian and Kermadec plates are among the fastest on Earth, being 8 cm (3.1 in) per year in the north and 4.5 cm (1.8 in) per year in the south.
