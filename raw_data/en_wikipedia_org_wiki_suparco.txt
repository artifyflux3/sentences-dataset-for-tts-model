7.3951 billion (US$25.61 million) [ 2 ] (2022–23) Website suparco .gov .pk The Space & Upper Atmosphere Research Commission , [ a ] commonly referred to as SUPARCO , is the national space agency of Pakistan .

[ 3 ] The agency, originally established in 1961 as a committee in Karachi, became an independent commission in 1981.

[ 4 ] Its initial objective was to learn rocketry and high altitude research from the United States, which ultimately led to the development of a national satellite program.

[ 5 ] This culminated in the successful launch of Pakistan's first satellite from China in 1990.

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] The agency was also an early participant in the rocket development program launched by the Ministry of Defence of Pakistan.

[ 7 ] The agency leads the National Space Program (NSP) and maintains the orbital operations of its satellites with support facilities throughout the country.

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] SUPARCO also serves as the secretariat for Pakistan Space Activities Regulatory Board (PSARB) which was established in February 2024 under the National Command Authority to regulate all space-related activities in Pakistan.

[ 10 ] [ 11 ] History [ edit ] Creation [ edit ] Main article: Executive Committee of the Space Research Council The past federal ministries of Pakistan initially avoided to fund the space program and engineering education in spite of opportunity available from the United States .

: 235 [ 12 ] The Punjab University was the only university that was undertaking the research in aeronautics in 1957; after the former Soviet Union launched its first satellite in space, the Sputnik 1 .

[ 13 ] It was during the development of Apollo program in 1961 when Abdus Salam found an opportunity for Pakistan to start its space program with the foreign funding coming from the United States .

[ 14 ] NASA , embarking on the Apollo program in a competition with Soviet space program , had realize the need of scientific data in upper atmosphere and therefore, invited India and Pakistan (bordering nations of the Indian Ocean ) to join the studies and experimentations.

[ 14 ] Initially, the engineers from Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) learned rocketry at the Wallops Flight Facility as Abdus Salam worked on getting approval for establishing a commission from the Ayub administration .

[ 14 ] A commission to study the upper atmosphere and rocketry was established under Abdus Salam [ 15 ] and Ishrat Usmani [ 16 ] as its chairman with nuclear engineers from PAEC, Tariq Mustafa and Salim Mehmud , becoming its first members in 1961 through the "Space Sciences Research Wing" of PAEC.

[ 17 ] The Commission was the first in the Muslim world to start studies in establishing a national space program, and was named as "Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission" to represent its purpose and mission on 16 September 1961.

: 237 [ 12 ] The Commission working under Abdus Salam was tasked with learning the rocket engineering , and contribution from France and the United States helped start this mission.

: 238 [ 12 ] Foundation of the agency made Pakistan the first South Asian country to start a space program.

[ 18 ] [ 19 ] Furthermore, a Flight Test Range was established in Sonmiani which is 50 km (31 mi) west of Karachi , from where a program of sounding rocket launches was conducted based on the Nike-Ajax rockets followed by the Judi-Dart program.

[ 14 ] On 7 July 1962, the Commission launched the first rocket, known as " Rehbar-I ", which reached the altitude of 80 mi (420,000 ft) in space.

[ 14 ] [ 20 ] The United States publicly supported and hailed the program as the beginning of "a program of continuous cooperation in space research of mutual interest." [ 21 ] Until 1972, the United States provided training on rocket engines at the Goddard Space Flight Center .

[ 21 ] The ground stations for satellite navigation were set up by the Commission in Karachi and Lahore in 1973, and were visited by the Apollo 17 astronauts.

[ 22 ] In 1973, the Islamabad Ionospheric Station was established at the Quaid-e-Azam University and Landsat ground station was established near Lahore.

[ 22 ] Funding and Support [ edit ] Following the cessation of U.S. funding for upper atmosphere research in 1972 and the prioritization of nuclear weapons programs after the 1971 war with India, SUPARCO experienced a significant decline in funding and support. Engineers with backgrounds in nuclear engineering were transferred to the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, and the Pakistan Air Force 's support for the Rehbar program also ceased.

[ 22 ] Following India's launch of its first satellite Aryabhata on an Soviet Kosmos-3M rocket in 1975, SUPARCO began lobbying for Pakistan's own satellite program. In 1981, the Commission was reorganized as an independent federal agency. During the same period, a communication satellite project called PakSAT was initiated. Collaborations with the Pakistan Radio Society (PRS) and the University of Surrey in England enabled SUPARCO to participate in satellite engineering projects, contributing to the development of UoSAT-1 and UO-11 , which were launched in 1984.

[ 23 ] [ 24 ] Pakistan's communication satellite program also led to the expansion of a ground station in Lahore in 1983. SUPARCO began constructing its first satellite, Badr-1 , in 1983, and it was eventually launched by China in 1990 after negotiations with the United States failed.

[ 25 ] SUPARCO continued its collaboration with the United Kingdom, developing the Badr-B satellite in partnership with the British Rutherford Laboratory . However, due to orbital crises and funding constraints, Badr-B was not launched until 2001 by Russia.

[ 26 ] Gen Zia's decision to delay the PakSAT project in 1984, citing a lack of funds, led to a significant setback for SUPARCO. This ultimately resulted in the loss of two orbital slots in 1993 and 1994.

[ 22 ] To secure a priority slot, the agency negotiated with Hughes Satellite Systems to acquire PakSAT-1 , a geo-stationary satellite originally intended for Indonesia.

[ 22 ] Functions [ edit ] As per the National Space Policy of Pakistan approved in 2024, SUPARCO as the National Space Agency is mandated to carry out all activities related to outer space which includes but not limited to the following: [ 27 ] Policy Development: Formulate national space policies and legislation to comply with international obligations and establish guidelines for the space sector.

Program Management: Plan, manage, and execute the National Space Program, encompassing space science, technology, and applications.
