[ 1 ] : 1 Another definition of wastewater is "Used water from any combination of domestic, industrial, commercial or agricultural activities, surface runoff / storm water, and any sewer infiltration or sewer inflow ".

[ 2 ] : 175 In everyday usage, wastewater is commonly a synonym for sewage (also called domestic wastewater or municipal wastewater), which is wastewater that is produced by a community of people.

As a generic term, wastewater may also describe water containing contaminants accumulated in other settings, such as: Industrial wastewater : waterborne waste generated from a variety of industrial processes, such as manufacturing operations, mineral extraction, power generation, or water and wastewater treatment .

Cooling water , is released with potential thermal pollution after use to condense steam or reduce machinery temperatures by conduction or evaporation.

Leachate : precipitation containing pollutants dissolved while percolating through ores, raw materials, products, or solid waste.

Return flow : the flow of water carrying suspended soil, pesticide residues, or dissolved minerals and nutrients from irrigated cropland .

Surface runoff : the flow of water occurring on the ground surface when excess rainwater , stormwater , meltwater , or other sources, can no longer sufficiently rapidly infiltrate the soil .

Urban runoff , including water used for outdoor cleaning activity and landscape irrigation in densely populated areas created by urbanization .

Agricultural wastewater : animal husbandry wastewater generated from confined animal operations.
