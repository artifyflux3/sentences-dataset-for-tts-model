[ 10 ] English is also official in the archipelago of San Andrés, Providencia and Santa Catalina .

[ 11 ] ^ The official Colombian time [ 12 ] is controlled and coordinated by the National Institute of Metrology.

[ 13 ] Colombia , [ b ] officially the Republic of Colombia , [ c ] is a country primarily located in South America with insular regions in North America . The Colombian mainland is bordered by the Caribbean Sea to the north, Venezuela to the east and northeast, Brazil to the southeast, Peru and Ecuador to the south and southwest, the Pacific Ocean to the west, and Panama to the northwest. Colombia is divided into 32 departments . The Capital District of Bogotá is also the country's largest city hosting the main financial and cultural hub. Other major urban areas include Medellín , Cali , Barranquilla , Cartagena , Santa Marta , Cúcuta , Ibagué , Villavicencio and Bucaramanga . It covers an area of 1,141,748 square kilometers (440,831 sq mi) and has a population of around 52 million. Its rich cultural heritage [ 15 ] —including language, religion, cuisine, and art—reflects its history as a colony, fusing cultural elements brought by immigration from Europe [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] and the Middle East , [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ] with those brought by the African diaspora , [ 23 ] as well as with those of the various Indigenous civilizations that predate colonization.

[ 24 ] Spanish is the official language , although Creole, English and 64 other languages are recognized regionally.

Colombia has been home to many indigenous peoples and cultures since at least 12,000 BCE. The Spanish first landed in La Guajira in 1499, and by the mid-16th century, they had colonized much of present-day Colombia, and established the New Kingdom of Granada , with Santa Fe de Bogotá as its capital.

Independence from the Spanish Empire is considered to have been declared in 1810, with what is now Colombia emerging as the United Provinces of New Granada . After a brief Spanish reconquest , Colombian independence was secured and the period of Gran Colombia began in 1819. The new polity experimented with federalism as the Granadine Confederation (1858) and then the United States of Colombia (1863), before becoming a centralised republic—the current Republic of Colombia—in 1886 . With the backing of the United States and France, Panama seceded from Colombia in 1903, resulting in Colombia's present borders. Beginning in the 1960s, the country has suffered from an asymmetric low-intensity armed conflict and political violence, both of which escalated in the 1990s. Since 2005, there has been significant improvement in security, stability, and rule of law, as well as unprecedented economic growth and development.

[ 25 ] [ 26 ] Colombia is recognized for its healthcare system , being the best healthcare in Latin America according to the World Health Organization and 22nd in the world.

[ 27 ] [ 28 ] Its diversified economy is the third-largest in South America, with macroeconomic stability and favorable long-term growth prospects.

[ 29 ] [ 30 ] Colombia is one of the world's seventeen megadiverse countries ; it has the highest level of biodiversity per square mile in the world and the second-highest level overall.

[ 31 ] Its territory encompasses Amazon rainforest , highlands , grasslands and deserts . It is the only country in South America with coastlines (and islands) along both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Colombia is a key member of major global and regional organizations including the UN , the WTO , the OECD , the OAS , the Pacific Alliance and the Andean Community ; it is also a NATO Global Partner [ 32 ] and a major non-NATO ally of the United States .

[ 33 ] Etymology The name "Colombia" is derived from the last name of the Italian navigator Christopher Columbus ( Latin : Christophorus Columbus , Italian : Cristoforo Colombo , Spanish: Cristóbal Colón ). It was conceived as a reference to all of the New World.

[ 34 ] The name was later adopted by the Republic of Colombia of 1819, formed from the territories of the old Viceroyalty of New Granada (modern-day Colombia, Panama, Venezuela, Ecuador, and northwest Brazil).

[ 35 ] When Venezuela, Ecuador, and Cundinamarca came to exist as independent states, the former Department of Cundinamarca adopted the name " Republic of New Granada ". New Granada officially changed its name in 1858 to the Granadine Confederation . In 1863 the name was again changed, this time to United States of Colombia , before finally adopting its present name – the Republic of Colombia – in 1886.

[ 35 ] To refer to this country, the Colombian government uses the terms Colombia and República de Colombia .

[ 36 ] History Main articles: History of Colombia and Timeline of Colombian history Pre-Columbian era Main article: Pre-Columbian cultures of Colombia Location map of the pre-Columbian cultures of Colombia Owing to its location, the present territory of Colombia was a corridor of early human civilization from Mesoamerica and the Caribbean to the Andes and Amazon basin . The oldest archaeological finds are from the Pubenza and El Totumo sites in the Magdalena Valley 100 kilometers (62 mi) southwest of Bogotá.

[ 37 ] These sites date from the Paleoindian period (18,000–8000 BCE). At Puerto Hormiga and other sites, traces from the Archaic Period (~8000–2000 BCE) have been found. Vestiges indicate that there was also early occupation in the regions of El Abra and Tequendama in Cundinamarca . The oldest pottery discovered in the Americas, found in San Jacinto , dates to 5000–4000 BCE.

[ 38 ] [ 39 ] Indigenous people inhabited the territory that is now Colombia by 12,500 BCE. Nomadic hunter-gatherer tribes at the El Abra, Tibitó and Tequendama sites near present-day Bogotá traded with one another and with other cultures from the Magdalena River Valley.

[ 40 ] A site including eight miles (13 km) of pictographs that is under study at Serranía de la Lindosa was revealed in November 2020.

[ 41 ] Their age is suggested as being 12,500 years old (c. 10,480 B.C.) by the anthropologists working on the site, because of extinct fauna depicted. It was during the earliest known human occupation of the area.

Between 5000 and 1000 BCE, hunter-gatherer tribes transitioned to agrarian societies; fixed settlements were established, and pottery appeared. Beginning in the 1st millennium BCE, groups of Amerindians including the Muisca , Zenú , Quimbaya , and Tairona developed the political system of cacicazgos with a pyramidal structure of power headed by caciques . The Muisca inhabited mainly the area of what is now the Departments of Boyacá and Cundinamarca high plateau ( Altiplano Cundiboyacense ) where they formed the Muisca Confederation . They farmed maize, potato, quinoa, and cotton, and traded gold, emeralds , blankets, ceramic handicrafts, coca and especially rock salt with neighboring nations. The Tairona inhabited northern Colombia in the isolated mountain range of Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta .

[ 42 ] [ 43 ] The Quimbaya inhabited regions of the Cauca River Valley between the Western and Central Ranges of the Colombian Andes.

[ 44 ] Most of the Amerindians practiced agriculture and the social structure of each indigenous community was different. Some groups of indigenous people such as the Caribs lived in a state of permanent war, but others had less bellicose attitudes.

[ 45 ] During the 1200s, Malayo-Polynesians and Native Americans in Colombia made contact, thereby spreading Native American genetics from Precolonial Colombia to some Pacific Ocean islands.

[ 46 ] [ 47 ] Colonial period Main articles: New Kingdom of Granada and Viceroyalty of New Granada See also: Spanish conquest of New Granada , Spanish conquest of the Muisca , Spanish colonization of the Americas , and Spanish Empire Vasco Núñez de Balboa , founder of Santa María la Antigua del Darién , the first stable European settlement on the continent Alonso de Ojeda (who had sailed with Columbus) reached the Guajira Peninsula in 1499.

[ 48 ] [ 49 ] Spanish explorers, led by Rodrigo de Bastidas , made the first exploration of the Caribbean coast in 1500.

[ 50 ] Christopher Columbus navigated near the Caribbean in 1502.

[ 51 ] In 1508, Vasco Núñez de Balboa accompanied an expedition to the territory through the region of Gulf of Urabá and they founded the town of Santa María la Antigua del Darién in 1510, the first stable settlement on the continent.

[ d ] [ 52 ] Santa Marta was founded in 1525, [ 53 ] and Cartagena in 1533.

[ 54 ] Spanish conquistador Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada led an expedition to the interior in April 1536, and christened the districts through which he passed " New Kingdom of Granada ". In August 1538, he provisionally founded its capital near the Muisca cacicazgo of Muyquytá , and named it "Santa Fe". The name soon acquired a suffix and was called Santa Fe de Bogotá.

[ 55 ] [ 56 ] Two other notable journeys by early conquistadors to the interior took place in the same period.

Sebastián de Belalcázar , conqueror of Quito , traveled north and founded Cali , in 1536, and Popayán , in 1537; [ 57 ] from 1536 to 1539, German conquistador Nikolaus Federmann crossed the Llanos Orientales and went over the Cordillera Oriental in a search for El Dorado , the "city of gold".

[ 58 ] [ 59 ] The legend and the gold would play a pivotal role in luring the Spanish and other Europeans to New Granada during the 16th and 17th centuries.

[ 60 ] The conquistadors made frequent alliances with the enemies of different indigenous communities.

Indigenous allies were crucial to conquest, as well as to creating and maintaining empire.

[ 61 ] Indigenous peoples in Colombia experienced a decline in population due to conquest as well as Eurasian diseases, such as smallpox , to which they had no immunity.

[ 62 ] [ 63 ] Regarding the land as deserted, the Spanish Crown sold properties to all persons interested in colonized territories, creating large farms and possession of mines.

[ 64 ] [ 65 ] [ 66 ] In the 16th century, the nautical science in Spain reached a great development thanks to numerous scientific figures of the Casa de Contratación and nautical science was an essential pillar of the Iberian expansion .

[ 67 ] In 1542, the region of New Granada, along with all other Spanish possessions in South America, became part of the Viceroyalty of Peru , with its capital in Lima .

[ 68 ] In 1547, New Granada became a separate captaincy-general within the viceroyalty, with its capital at Santa Fe de Bogota.

[ 69 ] In 1549, the Royal Audiencia was created by a royal decree, and New Granada was ruled by the Royal Audience of Santa Fe de Bogotá , which at that time comprised the provinces of Santa Marta, Rio de San Juan, Popayán, Guayana and Cartagena.

[ 70 ] But important decisions were taken from the colony to Spain by the Council of the Indies .

[ 71 ] [ 72 ] An illustration of the Battle of Cartagena de Indias , a major Spanish victory in the War of Jenkins' Ear [ 73 ] In the 16th century, European slave traders had begun to bring enslaved Africans to the Americas. Spain was the only European power that did not establish factories in Africa to purchase slaves; the Spanish Empire instead relied on the asiento system, awarding merchants from other European nations the license to trade enslaved peoples to their overseas territories.

[ 74 ] [ 75 ] This system brought Africans to Colombia, although many spoke out against the institution.

[ e ] [ f ] The indigenous peoples could not be enslaved because they were legally subjects of the Spanish Crown.

[ 80 ] To protect the indigenous peoples, several forms of land ownership and regulation were established by the Spanish colonial authorities: resguardos , encomiendas and haciendas .

[ 64 ] [ 65 ] [ 66 ] However, secret anti-Spanish discontentment was already brewing for Colombians since Spain prohibited direct trade between the Viceroyalty of Peru , which included Colombia, and the Viceroyalty of New Spain , which included the Philippines, the source of Asian products like silk and porcelain which was in demand in the Americas. Illegal trade between Peruvians, Filipinos, and Mexicans continued in secret, as smuggled Asian goods ended up in Córdoba, Colombia , the distribution center for illegal Asian imports, due to the collusion between these peoples against the authorities in Spain. They settled and traded with each other while disobeying the forced Spanish monopoly.

[ 81 ] Map of the Viceroyalty of New Granada The Viceroyalty of New Granada was established in 1717, then temporarily removed, and then re-established in 1739. Its capital was Santa Fé de Bogotá. This Viceroyalty included some other provinces of northwestern South America that had previously been under the jurisdiction of the Viceroyalties of New Spain or Peru and correspond mainly to today's Venezuela, Ecuador, and Panama. Bogotá became one of the principal administrative centers of the Spanish possessions in the New World, along with Lima and Mexico City , though it remained less developed compared to those two cities in several economic and logistical ways.

[ 82 ] [ 83 ] Great Britain declared war on Spain in 1739, and the city of Cartagena quickly became a top target for the British. A massive British expeditionary force was dispatched to capture the city, but, after achieving initial inroads, devastating outbreaks of disease crippled their numbers, and the British were forced to withdraw. The battle became one of Spain's most decisive victories in the conflict, and secured Spanish dominance in the Caribbean until the Seven Years' War .

[ 73 ] [ 84 ] The 18th-century priest, botanist, and mathematician José Celestino Mutis was delegated by Viceroy Antonio Caballero y Góngora to conduct an inventory of the nature of New Granada. Started in 1783, this became known as the Royal Botanical Expedition to New Granada . It classified plants and wildlife, and founded the first astronomical observatory in the city of Santa Fe de Bogotá.

[ 85 ] In July 1801 the Prussian scientist Alexander von Humboldt reached Santa Fe de Bogotá where he met with Mutis. In addition, historical figures in the process of independence in New Granada emerged from the expedition as the astronomer Francisco José de Caldas , the scientist Francisco Antonio Zea , the zoologist Jorge Tadeo Lozano and the painter Salvador Rizo .

[ 86 ] [ 87 ] Independence The accessibility of this section is in question .  Relevant discussion may be found on the talk page .

( November 2024 ) Main articles: Colombian War of Independence , First Republic of New Granada , and Gran Colombia The departments of Gran Colombia in 1824 Rebellions against Spanish rule had occurred in the empire since the advent of conquest and colonization, but most were either crushed or remained too weak to change the overall situation. The last one that sought outright independence from Spain sprang up around 1810 and culminated in the Colombian Declaration of Independence, issued on 20 July 1810, the day that is now celebrated as the nation's Independence Day.

[ 88 ] This movement followed the independence of Saint-Domingue (present-day Haiti) in 1804, which provided some support to an eventual leader of this rebellion: Simón Bolívar .

Francisco de Paula Santander also would play a decisive role.

[ 89 ] [ 90 ] [ 91 ] A movement was initiated by Antonio Nariño , who opposed Spanish centralism and led the opposition against the Viceroyalty .

[ 92 ] Cartagena became independent in November 1811.

[ 93 ] In 1811, the United Provinces of New Granada were proclaimed, headed by Camilo Torres Tenorio .

[ 94 ] [ 95 ] The emergence of two distinct ideological currents among the patriots ( federalism and centralism ) gave rise to a period of instability called the Patria Boba .

[ 96 ] Shortly after the Napoleonic Wars ended, Ferdinand VII , recently restored to the throne in Spain, unexpectedly decided to send military forces to retake most of northern South America. The viceroyalty was restored under the command of Juan de Sámano , whose regime punished those who participated in the patriotic movements, ignoring the political nuances of the juntas .

[ 97 ] The retribution stoked renewed rebellion, which, combined with a weakened Spain, made possible a successful rebellion led by the Venezuelan-born Simón Bolívar , who finally proclaimed independence in 1819.

[ 98 ] [ 99 ] The pro-Spanish resistance was defeated in 1822 in the present territory of Colombia and in 1823 in Venezuela.

[ 100 ] [ 101 ] [ 102 ] During the Independence War, between 250 and 400 thousand people (12–20% of the pre-war population) died.

[ 103 ] [ 104 ] [ 105 ] Changes to the borders of Colombia between 1811 and 2012 The territory of the Viceroyalty of New Granada became the Republic of Colombia , organized as a union of the current territories of Colombia, Panama, Ecuador, Venezuela, parts of Guyana and Brazil and north of Marañón River .

[ 106 ] The Congress of Cúcuta in 1821 adopted a constitution for the new Republic.

[ 107 ] [ 108 ] Simón Bolívar became the first President of Colombia , and Francisco de Paula Santander was made Vice President .

[ 109 ] However, the new republic was unstable and the Gran Colombia ultimately collapsed.

Modern Colombia comes from one of the countries that emerged after the dissolution of Gran Colombia , the other two being Ecuador and Venezuela.

[ 110 ] [ 111 ] [ 112 ] Colombia was the first constitutional government in South America, [ 113 ] and the Liberal and Conservative parties, founded in 1848 and 1849, respectively, are two of the oldest surviving political parties in the Americas.

[ 114 ] Slavery was abolished in the country in 1851.

[ 115 ] [ 116 ] Internal political and territorial divisions led to the dissolution of Gran Colombia in 1830.

[ 110 ] [ 111 ] The so-called " Department of Cundinamarca " adopted the name " New Granada ", which it kept until 1858 when it became the "Confederación Granadina" ( Granadine Confederation ). After a two-year civil war in 1863, the United States of Colombia was created, which became known as the Republic of Colombia in 1886.

[ 113 ] [ 117 ] Internal divisions remained between the bipartisan political forces, occasionally igniting very bloody civil wars, the most significant being the Thousand Days' War (1899–1902), in which between 100 and 180 thousand Colombians lost their lives when the Liberal Party , supported by Venezuela , Ecuador , Nicaragua , and Guatemala rebelled against the Nationalist government and took control of Santander , ultimately being defeated in 1902 by nationalist forces.

[ 118 ] 20th century See also: Colombian conflict and La Violencia The United States of America's intentions to influence the area (especially the Panama Canal construction and control) [ 119 ] led to the secession of the Department of Panama in 1903 and its political independence.

[ 120 ] The United States paid Colombia $25,000,000 in 1921, seven years after completion of the canal, for redress of President Roosevelt 's role in the creation of Panama, and Colombia recognized Panama under the terms of the Thomson–Urrutia Treaty .

[ 121 ] Colombia and Peru went to war because of territory disputes far in the Amazon basin . The war ended with a peace deal brokered by the League of Nations . The League finally awarded the disputed area to Colombia in June 1934.

[ 122 ] The Bogotazo in 1948 Soon after, Colombia achieved some degree of political stability, which was interrupted by a bloody conflict that took place between the late 1940s and the early 1950s, a period known as La Violencia ("The Violence"). Its cause was mainly mounting tensions between the two leading political parties, which subsequently ignited after the assassination of the Liberal presidential candidate Jorge Eliécer Gaitán on 9 April 1948.

[ 123 ] [ 124 ] The ensuing riots in Bogotá, known as El Bogotazo , spread throughout the country and claimed the lives of at least 180,000 Colombians.

[ 125 ] Colombia entered the Korean War when Laureano Gómez was elected president. It was the only Latin American country to join the war in a direct military role as an ally of the United States. Particularly important was the resistance of the Colombian troops at Old Baldy .

[ 126 ] The violence between the two political parties decreased first when Gustavo Rojas deposed the President of Colombia in a coup d'état and negotiated with the guerrillas, and then under the military junta of General Gabriel París .

[ 127 ] [ 128 ] The Axis of Peace and Memory, a memorial to the victims of the Colombian conflict (1964–present) After Rojas' deposition, the Colombian Conservative Party and the Colombian Liberal Party agreed to create the National Front , a coalition that would jointly govern the country. Under the deal, the presidency would alternate between conservatives and liberals every 4 years for 16 years; the two parties would have parity in all other elective offices.

[ 129 ] The National Front ended "La Violencia", and National Front administrations attempted to institute far-reaching social and economic reforms in cooperation with the Alliance for Progress .

[ 130 ] [ 131 ] Despite the progress in certain sectors, many social and political problems continued, and guerrilla groups were formally created such as the FARC , the ELN and the M-19 to fight the government and political apparatus.

[ 132 ] Since the 1960s, the country has suffered from an asymmetric low-intensity armed conflict between government forces , leftist guerrilla groups and right wing paramilitaries .

[ 133 ] The conflict escalated in the 1990s, [ 134 ] mainly in remote rural areas.

[ 135 ] Since the beginning of the armed conflict, human rights defenders have fought for the respect for human rights, despite staggering opposition.

[ g ] [ h ] Several guerrillas' organizations decided to demobilize after peace negotiations in 1989–1994.

[ 25 ] The United States has been heavily involved in the conflict since its beginnings, when in the early 1960s the U.S. government encouraged the Colombian military to attack leftist militias in rural Colombia. This was part of the U.S. fight against communism.

Mercenaries and multinational corporations such as Chiquita Brands International are some of the international actors that have contributed to the violence of the conflict.

[ 133 ] [ 25 ] [ 139 ] Beginning in the mid-1970s Colombian drug cartels became major producers, processors and exporters of illegal drugs , primarily marijuana and cocaine .

[ 140 ] On 4 July 1991, a new Constitution was promulgated. The changes generated by the new constitution are viewed as positive by Colombian society.

[ 141 ] [ 142 ] 21st century See also: Colombian peace process Former President Juan Manuel Santos signing a peace accord The administration of President Álvaro Uribe (2002–2010) adopted the democratic security policy which included an integrated counter-terrorism and counter-insurgency campaign.

[ 143 ] The government economic plan also promoted confidence in investors.

[ 144 ] As part of a controversial peace process, the AUC (right-wing paramilitaries) had ceased to function formally as an organization .

[ 145 ] In February 2008, millions of Colombians demonstrated against FARC and other outlawed groups.

[ 146 ] After peace negotiations in Cuba , the Colombian government of President Juan Manuel Santos and the guerrillas of the FARC-EP announced a final agreement to end the conflict.

[ 147 ] However, a referendum to ratify the deal was unsuccessful.

[ 148 ] [ 149 ] Afterward, the Colombian government and the FARC signed a revised peace deal in November 2016, [ 150 ] which the Colombian congress approved.

[ 151 ] In 2016, President Santos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize .

[ 152 ] The Government began a process of attention and comprehensive reparation for victims of conflict.

[ 168 ] It shares its maritime limits with Costa Rica , Nicaragua , Honduras , Jamaica , Haiti , and the Dominican Republic .

[ 169 ] Colombia is bordered to the northwest by Panama, to the east by Venezuela and Brazil, and to the south by Ecuador and Peru; [ 170 ] it established its maritime boundaries with neighboring countries through seven agreements on the Caribbean Sea and three on the Pacific Ocean.

[ 169 ] It lies between latitudes 12°N and 4°S and between longitudes 67° and 79°W .

East of the Andes lies the savanna of the Llanos , part of the Orinoco River basin, and in the far southeast, the jungle of the Amazon rainforest . Together these lowlands make up over half Colombia's territory, but they contain less than 6% of the population. To the north the Caribbean coast , home to 21.9% of the population and the location of the major port cities of Barranquilla and Cartagena , generally consists of low-lying plains, but it also contains the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta mountain range, which includes the country's tallest peaks ( Pico Cristóbal Colón and Pico Simón Bolívar ), and the La Guajira Desert . By contrast the narrow and discontinuous Pacific coastal lowlands , backed by the Serranía de Baudó mountains, are sparsely populated and covered in dense vegetation. The principal Pacific port is Buenaventura .

Below 1,000 meters (3,281 ft) in elevation is the warm altitudinal zone , where temperatures are above 24 °C (75.2 °F). About 82.5% of the country's total area lies in the warm altitudinal zone. The temperate climate altitudinal zone located between 1,001 and 2,000 meters (3,284 and 6,562 ft) is characterized for presenting an average temperature ranging between 17 and 24 °C (62.6 and 75.2 °F). The cold climate is present between 2,001 and 3,000 meters (6,565 and 9,843 ft) and the temperatures vary between 12 and 17 °C (53.6 and 62.6 °F). Beyond lies the alpine conditions of the forested zone and then the treeless grasslands of the páramos . Above 4,000 meters (13,123 ft), where temperatures are below freezing, the climate is glacial , a zone of permanent snow and ice.

[ 11 ] [ 305 ] [ 306 ] [ 307 ] Including Spanish, a total of 101 languages are listed for Colombia in the Ethnologue database. The specific number of spoken languages varies slightly since some authors consider as different languages what others consider to be varieties or dialects of the same language. Best estimates recorded 71 languages that are spoken in-country today – most of which belong to the Chibchan , Tucanoan , Bora–Witoto , Guajiboan , Arawakan , Cariban , Barbacoan , and Saliban language families. There are currently more than 850,000 speakers of native languages.

[ 308 ] [ 309 ] Ethnic groups Main article: Race and ethnicity in Colombia Racial groups in Colombia ( 2018 census ) [ 310 ] Undeclared (85.0%) Blacks (9.34%) Indigenous (4.31%) Romanis (0.01%) Not specified (1.35%) Colombia is ethnically diverse, its people descending from the original Native inhabitants, Spanish conquistadors, Africans originally brought to the country as slaves, and 20th-century immigrants from Europe and the Middle East , all contributing to a diverse cultural heritage.

[ 311 ] The demographic distribution reflects a pattern that is influenced by colonial history.

[ 312 ] Whites live all throughout the country, mainly in urban centers and the burgeoning highland and coastal cities. The populations of the major cities also include mestizos.

Mestizo campesinos (people living in rural areas) also live in the Andean highlands where some Spanish conquerors mixed with the women of Amerindian chiefdoms . Mestizos include artisans and small tradesmen that have played a major part in the urban expansion of recent decades.

[ 313 ] [ 2 ] In a study by the American Journal of Physical Anthropology, Colombians have an average ancestry of 47% Amerindian DNA, 42% European DNA, and 11% African DNA.

[ 314 ] The 2018 census reported that the "non-ethnic population", consisting of whites and mestizos (those of mixed European and Amerindian ancestry), constituted 87.6% of the national population. 6.7% is of African ancestry.

Indigenous Amerindians constitute 4.3% of the population.

Raizal people constitute 0.06% of the population.

Palenquero people constitute 0.02% of the population. 0.01% of the population are Roma . A study by Latinobarómetro in 2023 estimates that 50.3% of the population are Mestizo , 26.4% are White , 9.5% are Indigenous , 9.0% are Black , 4.4% are Mulatto , and 0.4% are Asian , these estimates would equate to around 26 million people being Mestizo, 14 million being White, 5 million being Indigenous, 5 million being Black, 2 million being Mulatto, and 200k being Asian.

[ 315 ] Ethnic groups of Colombia according to Latinobarómetro 2023 [ 315 ] Mestizo (50.3%) White (26.4%) Amerindian (9.50%) Black (9.00%) Mulatto (4.40%) East Asian (0.40%) The Federal Research Division estimated that the 86% of the population that did not consider themselves part of one of the ethnic groups indicated by the 2006 census was divided into 49% Mestizo or of mixed European and Amerindian ancestry, and 37% White, mainly of Spanish lineage, but there is also a large population of Middle East descent; in some sectors of society there is a considerable input of German and Italian ancestry.

[ 316 ] [ 2 ] Many of the Indigenous peoples experienced a reduction in population during the Spanish rule [ 317 ] and many others were absorbed into the mestizo population, but the remainder currently represents over eighty distinct cultures. Reserves ( resguardos ) established for indigenous peoples occupy 30,571,640 hectares (305,716.4 km 2 ) (27% of the country's total) and are inhabited by more than 800,000 people.

[ 318 ] Some of the largest indigenous groups are the Wayuu , [ 319 ] the Paez , the Pastos, the Emberá and the Zenú .

[ 320 ] The departments of La Guajira , Cauca , Nariño , Córdoba and Sucre have the largest indigenous populations.

[ 2 ] The Organización Nacional Indígena de Colombia (ONIC), founded at the first National Indigenous Congress in 1982, is an organization representing the indigenous peoples of Colombia. In 1991, Colombia signed and ratified the current international law concerning indigenous peoples, Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989 .

[ 321 ] Sub-Saharan Africans were brought as slaves , mostly to the coastal lowlands, beginning early in the 16th century and continuing into the 19th century. Large Afro-Colombian communities are found today on the Pacific Coast.

[ 322 ] Numerous Jamaicans migrated mainly to the islands of San Andres and Providencia. A number of other Europeans and North Americans migrated to the country in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including people from the former USSR during and after the Second World War .

[ 323 ] [ 324 ] Many immigrant communities have settled on the Caribbean coast, in particular recent immigrants from the Middle East and Europe . Barranquilla (the largest city of the Colombian Caribbean) and other Caribbean cities have the largest populations of Lebanese , Palestinian , and other Levantines .

[ 325 ] [ 326 ] There are also important communities of Romanis and Jews .

[ 311 ] There is a major migration trend of Venezuelans , due to the political and economic situation in Venezuela.

[ 327 ] In August 2019, Colombia offered citizenship to more than 24,000 children of Venezuelan refugees who were born in Colombia.

[ 328 ] Religion Main article: Religion in Colombia See also: Freedom of religion in Colombia , History of the Jews in Colombia , and Islam in Colombia The Las Lajas Sanctuary in the southern Colombian Department of Nariño The National Administrative Department of Statistics (DANE) does not collect religious statistics, and accurate reports are difficult to obtain. However, based on various studies and a survey, about 90% of the population adheres to Christianity, the majority of which (70.9%–79%) are Roman Catholic , while a significant minority (16.7%) adhere to Protestantism (primarily Evangelicalism ). Some 4.7% of the population is atheist or agnostic, while 3.5% claim to believe in God but do not follow a specific religion. 1.8% of Colombians adhere to Jehovah's Witnesses and Adventism and less than 1% adhere to other religions, such as the Baháʼí Faith , Islam , Judaism, Buddhism , Mormonism , Hinduism , Indigenous religions , Hare Krishna movement , Rastafari movement, Eastern Orthodox Church , and spiritual studies. The remaining people either did not respond or replied that they did not know. In addition to the above statistics, 35.9% of Colombians reported that they did not practice their faith actively.

[ 329 ] [ 330 ] [ 331 ] 1,519,562 people in Colombia, or around 3% of the population reported following an Indigenous religion.

While Colombia remains a mostly Roman Catholic country by baptism numbers, the 1991 Colombian constitution guarantees freedom of religion and all religious faiths and churches are equally free before the law.

[ 332 ] Health Main article: Health care in Colombia Colombia leads the annual América Economía ranking of the best clinics and hospitals in Latin America.

[ 333 ] The overall life expectancy in Colombia at birth is 79.3 years (76.7 years for males and 81.9 years for females).

[ 302 ] Healthcare reforms have led to massive improvements in the healthcare systems of the country, with health standards in Colombia improving very much since the 1980s. The new system has widened population coverage by the social and health security system from 21% (pre-1993) to 96% in 2012.

[ 336 ] Also in 2023, two Colombian hospitals were among the top 75 of the world.

[ 337 ] [ 338 ] Education Main article: Education in Colombia The educational experience of many Colombian children begins with attendance at a preschool academy until age five ( Educación preescolar ). Basic education ( Educación básica ) is compulsory by law.

[ 339 ] It has two stages: Primary basic education ( Educación básica primaria ) which goes from first to fifth grade – children from six to ten years old, and Secondary basic education ( Educación básica secundaria ), which goes from sixth to ninth grade. Basic education is followed by Middle vocational education ( Educación media vocacional ) that comprises the tenth and eleventh grades. It may have different vocational training modalities or specialties (academic, technical, business, and so on.) according to the curriculum adopted by each school.

[ 340 ] M5 building – National University of Colombia , designed by Pedro Nel Gómez After the successful completion of all the basic and middle education years, a high-school diploma is awarded. The high-school graduate is known as a bachiller , because secondary basic school and middle education are traditionally considered together as a unit called bachillerato (sixth to eleventh grade). Students in their final year of middle education take the ICFES test (now renamed Saber 11) to gain access to higher education ( Educación superior ). This higher education includes undergraduate professional studies, technical, technological and intermediate professional education, and post-graduate studies. Technical professional institutions of Higher Education are also opened to students holder of a qualification in Arts and Business. This qualification is usually awarded by the SENA after a two years curriculum.

[ 341 ] Bachilleres (high-school graduates) may enter into a professional undergraduate career program offered by a university; these programs last up to five years (or less for technical, technological and intermediate professional education, and post-graduate studies), even as much to six to seven years for some careers, such as medicine. In Colombia, there is not an institution such as college; students go directly into a career program at a university or any other educational institution to obtain a professional, technical or technological title. Once graduated from the university, people are granted a (professional, technical or technological) diploma and licensed (if required) to practice the career they have chosen. For some professional career programs, students are required to take the Saber-Pro test, in their final year of undergraduate academic education.

[ 340 ] Public spending on education as a proportion of gross domestic product in 2015 was 4.49%. This represented 15.05% of total government expenditure. The primary and secondary gross enrolment ratios stood at 113.56% and 98.09% respectively.

School-life expectancy was 14.42 years. A total of 94.58% of the population aged 15 and older were recorded as literate, including 98.66% of those aged 15–24.

[ 304 ] Crime Colombian National Police Special Operations Command (COPES) , displayed in Pereira . A subdivision of the National Police for the fight against organized crime and terrorist acts.

This section is an excerpt from Crime in Colombia .

[ edit ] Colombia has a high crime rate due to being a center for the cultivation and trafficking of cocaine . The Colombian conflict began in the mid-1960s and is a low-intensity conflict between Colombian governments , paramilitary groups , crime syndicates , and left-wing guerrillas such as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), and the National Liberation Army (ELN), fighting each other to increase their influence in Colombian territory. Two of the most important international actors that have contributed to the Colombian conflict are multinational companies and the United States.

[ 342 ] [ 343 ] [ 344 ] Elements of all the armed groups have been involved in drug trafficking . In a country where state capacity has been weak in some regions, the result has been a grinding war on multiple fronts, with the civilian population caught in between and often deliberately targeted for "collaborating". Human rights advocates blame paramilitaries for massacres, "disappearances", and cases of torture and forced displacement . Rebel groups are behind assassinations, kidnapping and extortion.

[ 345 ] In 2011, President Juan Manuel Santos launched the "Borders for Prosperity" plan [ 346 ] to fight poverty and combat violence from illegal armed groups along Colombia's borders through social and economic development.

[ 347 ] The plan received praise from the International Crisis Group .

[ 348 ] Colombia registered a homicide rate of 24.4 per 100,000 in 2016, the lowest since 1974. The 40-year low in murders came the same year the government signed a peace agreement with the FARC.

[ 349 ] The murder rate further decreased to 22.6 in 2020, though still among the highest in the world, it decreased 73% from 84 in 1991. In the 1980s and 1990s it regularly ranked as number one.

Since the beginning of the crisis in Venezuela and the mass emigration of Venezuelans during the Venezuelan refugee crisis , desperate Venezuelans have been recruited into gangs in order to survive by other Venezuelan gang members.

[ 350 ] Venezuelan women have also resorted to prostitution in order to make a living in Colombia.

[ 350 ] Also, many Venezuelan prisoners were released from Venezuelan prisons by Maduro. Gang groups from Venezuela have also migrated to Colombia and other countries.

Native American , Spanish and other European , African , American , Caribbean , and Middle Eastern influences, as well as other Latin American cultural influences, are all present in Colombia's modern culture. Urban migration, industrialization, globalization, and other political, social and economic changes have also left an impression.

[ citation needed ] Many national symbols , both objects and themes, have arisen from Colombia's diverse cultural traditions and aim to represent what Colombia, and the Colombian people, have in common. Cultural expressions in Colombia are promoted by the government through the Ministry of Culture .

[ 353 ] Literature Main article: Colombian literature The Nobel literature prize winner Gabriel García Márquez [ 354 ] Colombian literature dates back to pre-Columbian era; a notable example of the period is the epic poem known as the Legend of Yurupary .

Mural by Santiago Martínez Delgado Colombian art has over 3,000 years of history. Colombian artists have captured the country's changing political and cultural backdrop using a range of styles and mediums. There is archeological evidence of ceramics being produced earlier in Colombia than anywhere else in the Americas, dating as early as 3,000 BCE.

[ 374 ] [ 375 ] The earliest examples of gold craftsmanship have been attributed to the Tumaco people [ 376 ] of the Pacific coast and date to around 325 BCE. Roughly between 200 BCE and 800 CE, the San Agustín culture , masters of stonecutting , entered its "classical period". They erected raised ceremonial centers, sarcophagi , and large stone monoliths depicting anthropomorphic and zoomorphic forms out of stone .

[ 375 ] [ 377 ] Colombian art has followed the trends of the time, so during the 16th to 18th centuries, Spanish Catholicism had a huge influence on Colombian art, and the popular baroque style was replaced with rococo when the Bourbons ascended to the Spanish crown .

[ 378 ] [ 379 ] During this era, in the Spanish colony, the most important Neogranadine (Colombian) painters were Gregorio Vásquez de Arce y Ceballos , Gaspar de Figueroa , Baltasar Vargas de Figueroa , Baltasar de Figueroa (the Elder) , Antonio Acero de la Cruz and Joaquín Gutiérrez , of which their works are preserved. Also important was Alonso de Narváez who, although born in the province of Seville, spent most of his life in colonial Colombia, also the Italian Angelino Medoro , lived in Colombia and Peru, and left works of art preserved in several churches in Tunja city.

During the mid-19th century, one of the most remarkable painters was Ramón Torres Méndez , who produced a series of good quality paintings depicting the people and their customs of different Colombian regions. Also noteworthy in the 19th century were Andrés de Santa María , Pedro José Figueroa , Epifanio Garay , Mercedes Delgado Mallarino , José María Espinosa , Ricardo Acevedo Bernal , between many others.

More recently, Colombian artists Pedro Nel Gómez and Santiago Martínez Delgado started the Colombian Murial Movement in the 1940s, featuring the neoclassical features of Art Deco .

[ 374 ] [ 375 ] [ 380 ] [ 381 ] Since the 1950s, the Colombian art started to have a distinctive point of view, reinventing traditional elements under the concepts of the 20th century. Examples of this are the Greiff portraits by Ignacio Gómez Jaramillo , showing what the Colombian art could do with the new techniques applied to typical Colombian themes. Carlos Correa, with his paradigmatic "Naturaleza muerta en silencio" (silent dead nature), combines geometrical abstraction and cubism .

Alejandro Obregón is often considered as the father of modern Colombian painting, and one of the most influential artist in this period, due to his originality, the painting of Colombian landscapes with symbolic and expressionist use of animals, (specially the Andean condor ).

[ 375 ] [ 382 ] [ 383 ] Fernando Botero , Omar Rayo , Enrique Grau , Édgar Negret , David Manzur , Rodrigo Arenas Betancourt , Oscar Murillo , Doris Salcedo and Oscar Muñoz are some of the Colombian artists featured at the international level.

[ 374 ] [ 384 ] [ 385 ] [ 386 ] The Colombian sculpture from the sixteenth to 18th centuries was mostly devoted to religious depictions of ecclesiastic art, strongly influenced by the Spanish schools of sacred sculpture. During the early period of the Colombian republic, the national artists were focused in the production of sculptural portraits of politicians and public figures, in a plain neoclassicist trend.

[ 387 ] During the 20th century, the Colombian sculpture began to develop a bold and innovative work with the aim of reaching a better understanding of national sensitivity.

[ 375 ] [ 388 ] Colombian photography was marked by the arrival of the daguerreotype .
