[ 1 ] They are the main binding phase (the "glue") in most concrete . Only well defined and rare natural crystalline minerals can be abbreviated as CSH while extremely variable and poorly ordered phases without well defined stoichiometry , as it is commonly observed in hardened cement paste (HCP), are denoted C-S-H.

Preparation [ edit ] When water is added to cement, each of the compounds undergoes hydration and contributes to the final state of the concrete.

[ 2 ] Only calcium silicates contribute to the strength. Tricalcium silicate is responsible for most of the early strength (first 7 days).

[ 3 ] Dicalcium silicate, which reacts more slowly, only contributes to late strength.
Calcium silicate hydrate (also shown as C-S-H) is a result of the reaction between the silicate phases of Portland cement and water. This reaction typically is expressed as: 2 Ca 3 SiO 5 + 7 H 2 O  →  3 CaO · 2 SiO 2 · 4 H 2 O + 3 Ca(OH) 2 + 173.6 kJ also written in cement chemist notation , (CCN) as: 2 C 3 S + 7 H → C 3 S 2 H 4 + 3 CH + heat or, tricalcium silicate + water → calcium silicate hydrate + calcium hydroxide + heat The stoichiometry of C-S-H in cement paste is variable and the state of chemically and physically bound water in its structure is not transparent, which is why "-" is used between C, S, and H.

[ 4 ] Synthetic C-S-H can be prepared from the reaction of CaO and SiO 2 in water or through the double precipitation method using various salts. These methods provide the flexibility of producing C-S-H at specific C/S (Ca/Si, or CaO/SiO 2 ) ratios. The C-S-H from cement phases can also be treated with an ammonium nitrate solution in order to induce calcium leaching, and so to achieve a given C/S ratio.

Properties [ edit ] C-S-H is a nano sized material [ 5 ] [ 6 ] with some degree of crystallinity as observed by X-ray diffraction techniques.

[ 7 ] The underlying atomic structure of C-S-H is similar to the naturally occurring mineral tobermorite .

[ 8 ] It has a layered geometry with calcium silicate sheet structure separated by an interlayer space. The silicates in C-S-H exist as dimers, pentamers and 3n-1 chain units [ 9 ] [ 10 ] (where n is an integer greater than 0) and calcium ions are found to connect these chains making the three dimensional nano structure as observed by dynamic nuclear polarisation surface-enhanced nuclear magnetic resonance .

[ 11 ] The exact nature of the interlayer remains unknown. One of the greatest difficulties in characterising C-S-H is due to its variable stoichiometry .

[ citation needed ] The scanning electron microscope micrographs of C-S-H do not show any specific crystalline form. They usually manifest as foils or needle/oriented foils.

Synthetic C-S-H can be schematically divided into two categories, depending on whether their Ca/Si molar ratio is below or above a threshold value of 1.1. There are several indications that the chemical, physical and mechanical characteristics of C-S-H vary noticeably between these two categories.
