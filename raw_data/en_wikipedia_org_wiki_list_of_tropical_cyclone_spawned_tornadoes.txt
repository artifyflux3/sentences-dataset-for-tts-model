Intense tropical cyclones usually produce tornadoes , the majority of those weak, especially upon landfall .

List of tornadoes [ edit ] These are the tropical cyclones that are known to have spawned tornadoes. The list is most complete for the U.S., but does include other areas. Within the United States 1,163 tornadoes were associated with tropical cyclones, [ 1 ] accounting for slightly under 6% of all tornadoes. The most tornadoes spawned by a single tropical cyclone were associated with Hurricane Ivan , which spawned 120 tornadoes.
