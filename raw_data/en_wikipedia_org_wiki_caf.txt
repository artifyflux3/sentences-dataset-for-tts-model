The Café de Flore on the Rive Gauche in Paris is one of the oldest coffeehouses in the city. It is celebrated for its famous clientele, which included high-profile writers and philosophers.

A coffeehouse , coffee shop , or café ( French: [kafe] ⓘ ), is an establishment that serves various types of coffee, espresso , latte , americano and cappuccino , among other hot beverages. Many coffeehouses in West Asia offer shisha (actually called nargile in Levantine Arabic , Greek , and Turkish ), flavored tobacco smoked through a hookah . An espresso bar is a type of coffeehouse that specializes in serving espresso and espresso-based drinks. Some coffeehouses may serve iced coffee among other cold beverages, such as iced tea , as well as other non-caffeinated beverages. A coffeehouse may also serve food, such as light snacks, sandwiches , muffins , cakes, breads, pastries or donuts . Many doughnut shops in Canada and the U.S. serve coffee as an accompaniment to doughnuts, so these can be also classified as coffee shops, although doughnut shop tends to be more casual and serve lower-end fare which also facilitates take-out and drive-through which is popular in those countries, compared to a coffee shop or cafe which provides more gourmet pastries and beverages.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] In continental Europe, some cafés even serve alcoholic beverages.

While café may refer to a coffeehouse, the term "café" can also refer to a diner , British café (also colloquially called a "caff"), " greasy spoon " (a small and inexpensive restaurant), transport café , teahouse or tea room, or other casual eating and drinking place.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] A coffeehouse may share some of the same characteristics of a bar or restaurant, but it is different from a cafeteria (a canteen-type restaurant without table service). Coffeehouses range from owner-operated small businesses to large multinational corporations . Some coffeehouse chains operate on a franchise business model , with numerous branches across various countries around the world.

From a cultural standpoint coffeehouses largely serve as centers of social interaction: a coffeehouse provides patrons with a place to congregate, talk, read, write, entertain one another, or pass the time, whether individually or in small groups. A coffeehouse can serve as an informal social club for its regular members.

[ 8 ] As early as the 1950s Beatnik era and the 1960s folk music scene, coffeehouses have hosted singer-songwriter performances, typically in the evening.

[ 9 ] The digital age saw the rise of the Internet café along similar principles.

Etymology [ edit ] The word coffee in various European languages [ 10 ] The most common English spelling of café is the French word for both coffee and coffeehouse; [ 11 ] [ 12 ] it was adopted by English-speaking countries in the late 19th century.

[ 13 ] The Italian spelling, caffè , is also sometimes used in English.

[ 14 ] In Southern England , especially around London in the 1950s, the French pronunciation was often facetiously altered to / k æ f / and spelt caff .

[ 15 ] The English word coffee and French word café (coffeehouse) both derive from the Italian caffè [ 11 ] [ 16 ] —first attested as caveé in Venice in 1570 [ 17 ] —and in turn derived from Arabic qahwa ( قهوة ). The Arabic term qahwa originally referred to a type of wine, but after the wine ban by Islam , the name was transferred to coffee because of the similar rousing effect it induced.

[ 18 ] European knowledge of coffee (the plant, its seeds, and the drink made from the seeds) came through European contact with Turkey , likely via Venetian- Ottoman trade relations.

The English word café to describe a restaurant that usually serves coffee and snacks rather than the word coffee that describes the drink, is derived from the French café.

The first café in France is believed to have opened in 1660.

[ 11 ] The first café in Europe is believed to have been opened in Belgrade , Ottoman Serbia in 1522 as a Kafana (Serbian coffee house).

[ 19 ] The translingual word root /kafe/ appears in many European languages with various naturalized spellings, including Portuguese , Spanish , and French ( café ); German ( Kaffee ); Polish ( kawa ); Serbian ( кафа / kafa ); Ukrainian ( кава , 'kava'); and others.

History [ edit ] Ottoman Empire [ edit ] Ottoman miniature of a meddah performing at a coffeehouse Storyteller ( meddah ) at a coffeehouse in the Ottoman Empire . The first coffeehouses appeared in the Muslim world in the 15th century.

The first coffeehouses appeared in Damascus . These Ottoman coffeehouses have also appeared in Mecca , in the Arabian Peninsula in the 15th century, then spread to the Ottoman Empire 's capital of Istanbul in the 16th century and in Baghdad . Coffeehouses became popular meeting places where people gathered to drink coffee, have conversations, play board games such as chess and backgammon , listen to stories and music, and discuss news and politics. They became known as "schools of wisdom" for the type of clientele they attracted, and their free and frank discourse.

[ 20 ] [ 21 ] Coffeehouses in Mecca became a concern of imams who viewed them as places for political gatherings and drinking, leading to bans between 1512 and 1524.

[ 22 ] However, these bans could not be maintained, due to coffee becoming ingrained in daily ritual and culture among Arabs and neighboring peoples.

[ 20 ] The Ottoman chronicler İbrahim Peçevi reports in his writings (1642–49) about the opening of the first coffeehouse ( kiva han ) in Istanbul : Until the year 962 [1555], in the High, God-Guarded city of Constantinople , as well as in Ottoman lands generally, coffee and coffeehouses did not exist. About that year, a fellow called Hakam from Aleppo and a wag called Shams from Damascus came to the city; they each opened a large shop in the district called Tahtakale, and began to purvey coffee.

[ 23 ] A coffeehouse in Cairo , 18th century Persia [ edit ] The 17th-century French traveler and writer Jean Chardin gave a lively description of the Persian coffeehouse ( qahveh khaneh in Persian ) scene: People engage in conversation, for it is there that news is communicated and where those interested in politics criticize the government in all freedom and without being fearful, since the government does not heed what the people say. Innocent games ... resembling checkers , hopscotch, and chess, are played. In addition, mollas , dervishes , and poets take turns telling stories in verse or in prose. The narrations by the mollas and the dervishes are moral lessons, like our sermons, but it is not considered scandalous not to pay attention to them. No one is forced to give up his game or his conversation because of it. A molla will stand up in the middle, or at one end of the qahveh-khaneh, and begin to preach in a loud voice, or a dervish enters all of a sudden, and chastises the assembled on the vanity of the world and its material goods. It often happens that two or three people talk at the same time, one on one side, the other on the opposite, and sometimes one will be a preacher and the other a storyteller.

[ 24 ] Europe [ edit ] A coffeehouse in London , 17th century "Discussing the War in a Paris Café", The Illustrated London News , 17 September 1870, during the Franco-Prussian War In the 17th century, coffee appeared for the first time in Europe outside the Ottoman Empire , and coffeehouses were established, soon becoming increasingly popular. The first coffeehouse is said to have appeared in 1632 in Livorno , Italy founded by a Jewish merchant, [ 25 ] [ 26 ] or later in 1640, in Venice.

[ 27 ] In the 19th and 20th centuries in Europe, coffeehouses were very often meeting points for writers and artists.

[ 28 ] Austria [ edit ] A Viennese café Trieste from where the cappuccino spread The traditional tale of the origins of the Viennese café begins with the mysterious sacks of green beans left behind when the Turks were defeated in the Battle of Vienna in 1683. All the sacks of coffee were granted to the victorious Polish king Jan III Sobieski , who in turn gave them to one of his officers, Jerzy Franciszek Kulczycki , a Ukrainian cossack and Polish diplomat of Ruthenian descent. Kulczycki, according to the tale, then began the first coffeehouse in Vienna with the hoard, also being the first to serve coffee with milk. There is a statue of Kulczycki on a street also named after him.

However, it is now widely accepted that the first Viennese coffeehouse was actually opened by an Armenian merchant named Johannes Diodato (also known as Johannes Theodat). He opened a registered coffeehouse in Vienna in 1685.

[ 29 ] [ 30 ] Fifteen years later, four other Armenians owned coffeehouses.

[ 30 ] The culture of drinking coffee was itself widespread in the country in the second half of the 18th century.

Over time, a special coffee house culture developed in Habsburg Vienna . On the one hand, writers, artists, musicians, intellectuals, bon vivants and their financiers met in the coffee house, and on the other hand, new coffee varieties were always served. In the coffee house, people played cards or chess, worked, read, thought, composed, discussed, argued, observed and just chatted. A lot of information was also obtained in the coffee house, because local and foreign newspapers were freely available to all guests. This form of coffee house culture spread throughout the Habsburg Empire in the 19th century.

[ 31 ] [ 32 ] Scientific theories, political plans but also artistic projects were worked out and discussed in Viennese coffee houses all over Central Europe. James Joyce even enjoyed his coffee in a Viennese coffee house on the Adriatic sea in Trieste , then and now the main port for coffee and coffee processing in Italy and Central Europe. From there, the Viennese Kapuziner coffee developed into today's world-famous cappuccino . This special multicultural atmosphere of the Habsburg coffee houses was largely destroyed by the later National Socialism and Communism and can only be found today in a few places that have long been in the slipstream of history, such as Vienna or Trieste.

[ 33 ] [ 34 ] [ 35 ] [ 36 ] England [ edit ] Main article: English coffeehouses in the 17th and 18th centuries The first coffeehouse in England was set up on the High Street in Oxford in 1650 [ 37 ] –1651 [ 38 ] [ page needed ] by "Jacob the Jew". A second competing coffee house was opened across the street in 1654, by "Cirques Jobson, the Jew" ( Queen's Lane Coffee House ).

[ 39 ] In London , the earliest coffeehouse was established by Pasqua Rosée in 1652.

[ 40 ] Anthony Wood observed of the coffee houses of Oxford in his Life and Times (1674) "The decay of study, and consequently of learning, are coffee houses, to which most scholars retire and spend much of the day in hearing and  speaking of news".

[ 41 ] The proprietor was Pasqua Rosée, the servant of a trader in goods from the Ottoman Empire named Daniel Edwards, who imported the coffee and assisted Rosée in setting up the establishment there.

[ 42 ] [ 43 ] From 1670 to 1685, the number of London coffeehouses began to increase, and they also began to gain political importance due to their popularity as places of debate.

[ 44 ] English coffeehouses were significant meeting places, particularly in London. By 1675, there were more than 3,000 coffeehouses in England.

[ 45 ] The coffeehouses were great social levelers, open to all men and indifferent to social status, and as a result associated with equality and republicanism. Entry gave access to books or print news. Coffeehouses boosted the popularity of print news culture and helped the growth of various financial markets including insurance, stocks, and auctions.

Lloyd's of London had its origins in a coffeehouse run by Edward Lloyd, where underwriters of ship insurance met to do business. The rich intellectual atmosphere of early London coffeehouses was available to anyone who could pay the sometimes one penny entry fee, giving them the name of 'Penny Universities' .

[ 46 ] Though Charles II later tried to suppress London coffeehouses as "places where the disaffected met, and spread scandalous reports concerning the conduct of His Majesty and his Ministers", the public still flocked to them. For several decades following the Restoration , the wits gathered around John Dryden at Will's Coffee House , in Russell Street, Covent Garden .

[ 47 ] As coffeehouses were believed to be areas where anti-government gossip could easily spread, Queen Mary II and the London City magistrates tried to prosecute people who frequented coffeehouses as they were liable to "spread false and seditious reports".

William III 's privy council also suppressed Jacobite sympathizers in the 1680s and 1690s in coffeehouses as these were the places that they believed harbored plotters against the regimes.

[ 48 ] By 1739, there were 551 coffeehouses in London; each attracted a particular clientele divided by occupation or attitude, such as Tories and Whigs , wits and stockjobbers , merchants and lawyers, booksellers and authors, men of fashion or the "cits" of the old city centre . According to one French visitor, Abbé Prévost , coffeehouses, "where you have the right to read all the papers for and against the government", were the "seats of English liberty".

[ 49 ] Jonathan's Coffee-House in 1698 saw the listing of stock and commodity prices that evolved into the London Stock Exchange .

Lloyd's Coffee House provided the venue for merchants and shippers to discuss insurance deals [ repetition ] , leading to the establishment of Lloyd's of London insurance market, the Lloyd's Register classification society , and other related businesses. Auctions in salesrooms attached to coffeehouses provided the start for the great auction houses of Sotheby's and Christie's .

In Victorian England, the temperance movement set up coffeehouses (also known as coffee taverns) for the working classes, as a place of relaxation free of alcohol , an alternative to the public house .

[ 50 ] [ 51 ] Romania [ edit ] In 1667, Kara Hamie, a former Ottoman Janissary from Constantinople , opened the first coffee shop in Bucharest (then the capital of the Principality of Wallachia ), in the center of the city, where today sits the main building of the National Bank of Romania .

[ 52 ] France [ edit ] Pasqua Rosée, an Armenian by the name Harutiun Vartian, also established the first coffeehouse in Paris in 1672 and held a citywide coffee monopoly until Procopio Cutò , his apprentice, opened the Café Procope in 1686.

[ 53 ] This coffeehouse still exists today and was a popular meeting place of the French Enlightenment ; Voltaire , Rousseau , and Denis Diderot frequented it, and it is arguably the birthplace of the Encyclopédie , the first modern encyclopedia.

Hungary [ edit ] The first known cafes in Pest date back to 1714 when a house intended to serve as a Cafe (Balázs Kávéfőző) was purchased. Minutes of the Pest City Council from 1729 mention complaints by the Balázs café and Franz Reschfellner Cafe against the Italian-originated café of Francesco Bellieno for selling underpriced coffee.

[ 54 ] Italy [ edit ] Caffè Florian in Venice During the 18th century, the oldest extant coffeehouses in Italy were established: Caffè Florian in Venice, Antico Caffè Greco in Rome , Caffè Pedrocchi in Padua , Caffè dell'Ussero in Pisa and Caffè Fiorio in Turin .

Ireland [ edit ] In the 18th century, Dublin coffeehouses functioned as early reading centers and the emergence of circulation and subscription libraries that provided greater access to printed material for the public. The interconnectivity of the coffeehouse and virtually every aspect of the print trade were evidenced by the incorporation of printing, publishing, selling, and viewing of newspapers, pamphlets and books on the premises, most notably in the case of Dick's Coffee House , owned by Richard Pue; thus contributing to a culture of reading and increased literacy.

[ 55 ] These coffeehouses were a social magnet where different strata of society came together to discuss topics covered by the newspapers and pamphlets. Most coffeehouses of the 18th century would eventually be equipped with their own printing presses or incorporate a book shop.

[ 56 ] Today, the term café is used for most coffeehouses – this can be spelled both with and without an acute accent , but is always pronounced as two syllables. The name café has also come to be used for a type of diners that offers cooked meals (again, without alcoholic beverages) which can be standalone or operating within shopping centres or department stores. In Irish usage, the presence or absence of the acute accent does not signify the type of establishment (coffeehouse versus diner), and is purely a decision by the owner: for instance, the two largest diner-style café chains in Ireland in the 1990s were named "Kylemore Cafe" and " Bewley's Café " – i.e., one written without, and one with, the acute accent.

Portugal [ edit ] Statue of Fernando Pessoa by Lagoa Henriques, next to the A Brasileira café, in Chiado , Lisbon The history of coffee in Portugal is usually told to have begun during the reign of king John V , when Portuguese agent Francisco de Melo Palheta supposedly managed to steal coffee beans from the Dutch East India Company and introduce it to Brazil. From Brazil, coffee was taken to Cape Verde and São Tomé and Príncipe , which were also Portuguese colonies at the time. Despite this story, coffee already existed in Angola , having been introduced by Portuguese missionaries . During the 18th century, the first public cafés appeared, inspired by French gatherings from the 17th century, becoming spaces for cultural and artistic entertainment.

Several cafes emerged in Lisbon such as: Martinho da Arcada (being the oldest café still functioning, having opened in 1782), Café Tavares , Botequim Parras, among others .

Of these several became famous for harbouring poets and artists, such as Manuel du Bocage with his visits to Café Nicola, which opened in 1796 by the Italian Nicola Breteiro; and Fernando Pessoa with his visits to A Brasileira , which opened in 1905 by Adriano Teles. The most famous of these coffee houses was the Café Marrare , opened by the napolitan Antonio Marrare, in 1820, frequently visited by Júlio Castilho, Raimundo de Bulhão Pato, Almeida Garrett , Alexandre Herculano and other members of the Portuguese government and the intelligentsia . It began its saying: « Lisboa era Chiado , o Chiado era o Marrare e o Marrare ditava a lei » (English: "Lisbon was the Chiado, the Chiado was the Marrare and the Marrare dictated the law").

Other coffee houses soon opened across the country, such as Café Vianna, opened in Braga , in 1858, by Manoel José da Costa Vianna, which was also visited by important Portuguese writers such as Camilo Castelo Branco and Eça de Queirós . During the 1930's , a surge in coffee houses happened in Porto with the opening of several that still exist, such as Café Guarany , opened in 1933, and A Regaleira , opened in 1934.

Switzerland [ edit ] In 1761 the Turm Kaffee, a shop for exported goods, was opened in St. Gallen .

[ 57 ] Finland [ edit ] Café Ekberg in 2024 Finland's first coffee house, Kaffehus, was founded in Turku in 1778.

[ 58 ] The oldest still-in-use coffee house in Helsinki called Café Ekberg was founded 1852.

[ 59 ] Gender [ edit ] The exclusion of women from coffeehouses as guests was not universal, but does appear to have been common in Europe. In Germany, women frequented them, but in England and France they were banned.

[ 60 ] Émilie du Châtelet purportedly cross-dressed to gain entrance to a coffeehouse in Paris .

[ 61 ] In a well-known engraving of a Parisian café c. 1700, [ 62 ] the gentlemen hang their hats on pegs and sit at long communal tables strewn with papers and writing implements. Coffee pots are ranged at an open fire, with a hanging cauldron of boiling water. The only woman present presides, separated in a canopied booth, from which she serves coffee in tall cups.

Aside from the discussion around women as guests of the coffeehouses, it is noted that women did work as waitresses at coffeehouses and also managed coffeehouses as proprietors. Well known women in the coffeehouse business were Moll King in England, and Maja-Lisa Borgman in Sweden.

[ 63 ] Contemporary [ edit ] In most European countries, such as Spain , Austria , Denmark , Germany, Norway , Sweden , Portugal , and others, the term café means a restaurant primarily serving coffee, as well as pastries such as cakes , tarts , pies , or buns . Many cafés also serve light meals such as sandwiches. European cafés often have tables on the pavement (sidewalk) as well as indoors. Some cafés also serve alcoholic drinks (e.g., wine), particularly in Southern Europe. In the Netherlands and Belgium, a café is the equivalent of a bar, and also sells alcoholic drinks. In the Netherlands a koffiehuis serves coffee, while a coffee shop (using the English term) sells "soft" drugs ( cannabis and hashish ) and is generally not allowed to sell alcoholic drinks. In France, most cafés serve as lunch restaurants in the day, and bars in the evening. They generally do not have pastries except in the mornings, when a croissant or pain au chocolat can be purchased with breakfast coffee. In Italy, cafés are similar to those found in France and known as bar . They typically serve a variety of espresso coffee, cakes and alcoholic drinks. Bars in city centers usually have different prices for consumption at the bar and consumption at a table.

[ 64 ] [ citation needed ] Americas [ edit ] Argentina [ edit ] Café Tortoni is an emblematic café in Buenos Aires. Frequented by Jorge Luis Borges among many other figures of Argentina.

Coffeehouses are part of the culture of Buenos Aires and the customs of its inhabitants. They are traditional meeting places for 'porteños' and have inspired innumerable artistic creations. Some notable coffeehouses include Confitería del Molino , Café Tortoni , El Gato Negro , and Café La Biela .

United States [ edit ] Caffe Reggio on MacDougal Street in New York City's Manhattan which was founded in 1927 The first coffeehouse in America opened in Boston , in 1676.

[ 65 ] However, Americans did not start choosing coffee over tea until the Boston Tea Party and the Revolutionary War . After the Revolutionary War, Americans momentarily went back to drinking tea until after the War of 1812 when they began importing high-quality coffee from Latin America and expensive inferior-quality tea from American shippers instead of Great Britain.

[ 66 ] [ 67 ] Whether they were drinking coffee or tea, coffeehouses served a similar purpose to that which they did in Great Britain, as places where business was done. In the 1780s, Merchant's Coffee House located on Wall Street in New York City was home to the organization of the Bank of New York and the New York Chamber of Commerce .

[ 68 ] Coffeehouses in the United States arose from the espresso - and pastry-centered Italian coffeehouses of the Italian American immigrant communities in the major U.S. cities, notably New York City 's Little Italy and Greenwich Village , Boston's North End , and San Francisco's North Beach . From the late 1950s onward, coffeehouses also served as a venue for entertainment, most commonly folk performers during the American folk music revival .

[ 69 ] Both Greenwich Village and North Beach became major haunts of the Beats , who were highly identified with these coffeehouses. As the youth culture of the 1960s evolved, non-Italians consciously copied these coffeehouses. The political nature of much of 1960s folk music made the music a natural tie-in with coffeehouses with their association with political action. A number of well-known performers like Joan Baez and Bob Dylan began their careers performing in coffeehouses.

Blues singer Lightnin' Hopkins bemoaned his woman's inattentiveness to her domestic situation due to her overindulgence in coffeehouse socializing in his 1969 song "Coffeehouse Blues".

[ citation needed ] In 1966, Alfred Peet began applying the dark roast style to high quality beans and opened up a small shop in Berkeley, California to educate customers on the virtues of good coffee.

[ 66 ] Starting in 1967 with the opening of the historic Last Exit on Brooklyn coffeehouse, Seattle became known for its thriving countercultural coffeehouse scene; the Starbucks chain later standardized and mainstreamed this espresso bar model, now prevalent throughout the country.

[ 70 ] [ 71 ] [ 72 ] From the 1960s through the mid-1980s, churches and individuals in the United States used the coffeehouse concept for outreach. They were often storefronts and had names like The Lost Coin ( Greenwich Village ), The Gathering Place ( Riverside, CA ), Catacomb Chapel (New York City), and Jesus For You ( Buffalo, NY ). Christian music (often guitar-based) was performed, coffee and food was provided, and Bible studies were convened as people of varying backgrounds gathered in a casual setting that was purposefully different from traditional churches. An out-of-print book, published by the ministry of David Wilkerson, titled, A Coffeehouse Manual , served as a guide for Christian coffeehouses, including a list of name suggestions for coffeehouses.

[ 73 ] Format [ edit ] See also: List of coffeehouse chains Coffeehouses often sell pastries or other food items.

Cafés may have an outdoor section (terrace, pavement or sidewalk café ) with seats, tables and parasols. This is especially the case with European cafés. Cafés offer a more open public space compared to many of the traditional pubs they have replaced, which were more male dominated with a focus on drinking alcohol.

One of the original uses of the café, as a place for information exchange and communication, was reintroduced in the 1990s with the Internet café or Hotspot .

[ 74 ] The spread of modern-style cafés to urban and rural areas went hand-in-hand with the rising use of mobile computers. Computers and Internet access in a contemporary-styled venue help to create a youthful, modern place, compared to the traditional pubs or old-fashioned diners that they replaced.

Asia [ edit ] Coffeehouses in Egypt are colloquially called ' ahwah /ʔhwa/ , which is the dialectal pronunciation of قَهْوة qahwah (literally "coffee") [ 75 ] [ 76 ] ( see also Arabic phonology#Local variations ). Also commonly served in ' ahwah are tea ( shāy ) and herbal teas , especially the highly popular hibiscus blend ( Egyptian Arabic : karkadeh or ennab ). The first ' ahwah opened around the 1850s and were originally patronized mostly by older people, with youths frequenting but not always ordering. There were associated by the 1920s with clubs (Cairo), bursa ( Alexandria ) and gharza (rural inns). In the early 20th century, some of them became crucial venues for political and social debates.

[ 75 ] In India, coffee culture has expanded in the past twenty years. Chains like Indian Coffee House , Café Coffee Day , Barista Lavazza have become very popular. Cafes are considered good venues to conduct office meetings and for friends to meet.

[ 77 ] In China, an abundance of recently started domestic coffeehouse chains may be seen accommodating business people for conspicuous consumption , with coffee prices sometimes even higher than in the West.

In Malaysia and Singapore, traditional breakfast and coffee shops are called kopi tiam . The word is a portmanteau of the Malay word for coffee (as borrowed and altered from English) and the Hokkien dialect word for shop ( 店 ; POJ : tiàm). Menus typically feature simple offerings: a variety of foods based on egg , toast , and coconut jam , plus coffee, tea, and Milo , a malted chocolate drink that is extremely popular in Southeast Asia and Australasia, particularly Singapore and Malaysia.

In Indonesia, traditional coffee houses are called kedai kopi , rumah kopi , or warung kopi which is often abbreviated as warkop .

Kopi tubruk is a common drink in small warkop . As a coffee drink companion, traditional kue is also served in the coffee house. The first coffee house in Indonesia was founded in 1878 in Jakarta which named Warung Tinggi Tek Sun Ho .

[ 78 ] In the Philippines, coffee shop chains like Starbucks have become the prevalent hangouts for upper- and middle-class professionals in such districts as the Makati CBD . However, carinderias (small eateries) continue to serve coffee alongside breakfast and snack dishes. Events called "Kapihan" (fora) are often held inside bakeshops or restaurants that also serve coffee for breakfast or merienda . There are also a number of establishments often referred to as "cafés" that serve not just coffee and pastries, but full meals, often international cuisine highly altered to Filipino tastes.

[ 79 ] In Thailand, the term "café" is not only a coffeehouse in the international definition, as in other countries, but in the past was considered a night restaurant that serves alcoholic drinks during a comedy show on stage. The era in which this type of business flourished was the 1990s, before the 1997 financial crisis .

[ 80 ] The first real coffeehouse in Thailand opened in 1917 at the Si Kak Phraya Si in the area of Rattanakosin Island , by Madam Cole , an American woman who living in Thailand at that time, Later, Chao Phraya Ram Rakop (เจ้าพระยารามราฆพ), Thai aristocrat, opened a coffeehouse named "Café de Norasingha" (คาเฟ่นรสิงห์) located at Sanam Suea Pa (สนามเสือป่า), the ground next to the Royal Plaza .

[ 81 ] At present, Café de Norasingha has been renovated and moved to within Phayathai Palace .

[ 82 ] In the southern region , a traditional coffeehouse or kopi tiam is popular with locals, like many countries in the Malay Peninsula .

[ 83 ] A coffee shop in Bacoor , Philippines Rumah Loer, a contemporary-style coffee shop ( Indonesian : rumah kopi kekinian ) in Palembang , Indonesia A shop specialised in drip coffee in Nakhon Ratchasima , Thailand Australia [ edit ] The Federal Coffee Palace , built on Collins Street, Melbourne, in 1888, was the largest and grandest Coffee Palace ever built. It was demolished in 1973.

Centre Place, Melbourne . Australia and New Zealand have competing claims as being the birthplace of the " flat white ".

In the 19th century, coffee houses such as the Collingwood Coffee Palace or the Federal Coffee Palace in the centre of Melbourne were established and were part of the temperance movement to reduce the consumption of alcohol in society.

[ 84 ] In modern Australia, coffee shops are ubiquitously known as cafés . Since the post- World War II influx of Italian and Greek immigrants introduced the first espresso coffee machines to Australia in the 1950s, there was initially a slow rise in café culture, particularly in Melbourne, until a boom in locally owned cafés Australia-wide began in the 1990s.

[ 85 ] Alongside the rise in the number of cafés there has been a rise in demand for locally (or on-site) roasted specialty coffee, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne. A local favourite is the " flat white " which remains a popular coffee drink.

[ 86 ] Africa [ edit ] In Cairo , the capital of Egypt, most cafés have shisha (waterpipe). Most Egyptians indulge in the habit of smoking shisha while hanging out at the café, watching a match, studying, or even sometimes finishing some work. In Addis Ababa , the capital of Ethiopia, independent coffeehouses that struggled before 1991 have become popular with young professionals who do not have time for traditional coffee roasting at home. One establishment that has become well-known is the Tomoca coffee shop, which opened in 1953.

[ 87 ] [ 88 ] Europe [ edit ] United Kingdom [ edit ] The patrons of the first coffeehouse in England, The Angel, which opened in Oxford in 1650, [ 89 ] and the mass of London coffee houses that flourished over the next three centuries, were far removed from those of modern Britain. Haunts for teenagers in particular, Italian-run espresso bars and their formica -topped tables were a feature of 1950s Soho that provided a backdrop as well as a title for Cliff Richard 's 1960 film Expresso Bongo . The first was The Moka in Frith Street , opened by Gina Lollobrigida in 1953. With their "exotic Gaggia coffee machine [s],... Coke, Pepsi, weak frothy coffee and... Suncrush orange fountain[s]" [ 90 ] they spread to other urban centers during the 1960s, providing affordable, warm places for young people to congregate and an ambience far removed from the global coffee bar standard that would be established in the final decades of the century by chains such as Starbucks and Pret a Manger .

( October 2018 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Interior of an espresso bar from Baliwag , Philippines The espresso bar is a type of coffeehouse that specializes in coffee drinks made from espresso . Originating in Italy, the espresso bar has spread throughout the world in various forms. Prime examples that are internationally known are Starbucks Coffee , based in Seattle , U.S., and Costa Coffee , based in Loudwater , U.K. (the first and second largest coffeehouse chains respectively), although the espresso bar exists in some form throughout much of the world.

The espresso bar is typically centered around a long counter with a high-yield espresso machine (usually bean to cup machines, automatic or semiautomatic pump-type machine, although occasionally a manually operated lever-and-piston system) and a display case containing pastries and occasionally savory items such as sandwiches. In the traditional Italian bar, customers either order at the bar and consume their drinks standing or, if they wish to sit down and be served, are usually charged a higher price. In some bars there is an additional charge for drinks served at an outside table. In other countries, especially the United States, seating areas for customers to relax and work are provided free of charge. Some espresso bars also sell coffee paraphernalia, candy, and even music. North American espresso bars were also at the forefront of widespread adoption of public Wi-Fi access points to provide Internet services to people doing work on laptop computers on the premises.

The offerings at the typical espresso bar are generally quite Italianate in inspiration; biscotti , cannoli and pizzelle are a common traditional accompaniment to a caffe latte or cappuccino . Some upscale espresso bars even offer alcoholic drinks such as grappa and sambuca. Nevertheless, typical pastries are not always strictly Italianate and common additions include scones , muffins , croissants , and even doughnuts . There is usually a large selection of teas as well, and the North American espresso bar culture is responsible for the popularization of the Indian spiced tea drink masala chai . Iced drinks are also popular in some countries, including both iced tea and iced coffee as well as blended drinks such as Starbucks' Frappucino .

A worker in an espresso bar is referred to as a barista . The barista is a skilled position that requires familiarity with the drinks being made (often very elaborate, especially in North American-style espresso bars), a reasonable facility with some equipment as well as the usual customer service skills.
