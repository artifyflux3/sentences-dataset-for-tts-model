Lytic granules (red) are secreted at the contact site, killing the target. Cytotoxic T cells are powerful agents of cellular immunity.

Cellular immunity , also known as cell-mediated immunity , is an immune response that does not rely on the production of antibodies . Rather, cell-mediated immunity is the activation of phagocytes , antigen-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes , and the release of various cytokines in response to an antigen .

History [ edit ] In the late 19th century Hippocratic tradition medicine system, the immune system was imagined into two branches: humoral immunity , for which the protective function of immunization could be found in the humor (cell-free bodily fluid or serum ) and cellular immunity , for which the protective function of immunization was associated with cells.

CD4 cells or helper T cells provide protection against different pathogens .

Naive T cells , which are immature T cells that have yet to encounter an antigen , are converted into activated effector T cells after encountering antigen-presenting cells (APCs). These APCs, such as macrophages , dendritic cells , and B cells in some circumstances, load antigenic peptides onto the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) of the cell, in turn presenting the peptide to receptors on T cells. The most important of these APCs are highly specialized dendritic cells; conceivably operating solely to ingest and present antigens.

[ 1 ] Activated effector T cells can be placed into three functioning classes, detecting peptide antigens originating from various types of pathogen : The first class being 1) Cytotoxic T cells , which kill infected target cells by apoptosis without using cytokines, 2) T h 1 cells , which primarily function to activate macrophages, and 3) T h 2 cells , which primarily function to stimulate B cells into producing antibodies .

[ 1 ] In another ideology, the innate immune system and the adaptive immune system each comprise both humoral and cell-mediated components. Some cell-mediated components of the innate immune system include myeloid phagocytes , innate lymphoid cells ( NK cells ) and intraepithelial lymphocytes .

[ 2 ] Synopsis [ edit ] Cellular immunity protects the body through: T-cell mediated immunity or T-cell immunity: activating antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells that are able to induce apoptosis in body cells displaying epitopes of foreign antigen on their surface, such as virus -infected cells, cells with intracellular bacteria , and cancer cells displaying tumor antigens; Macrophage and natural killer cell action: enabling the destruction of pathogens via recognition and secretion of cytotoxic granules (for natural killer cells) [ 3 ] and phagocytosis (for macrophages); [ 4 ] and Stimulating cells to secrete a variety of cytokines that influence the function of other cells involved in adaptive immune responses and innate immune responses.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] Cell-mediated immunity is directed primarily at microbes that survive in phagocytes and microbes that infect non-phagocytic cells. It is most effective in removing virus-infected cells , but also participates in defending against fungi , protozoans , cancers , and intracellular bacteria. It also plays a major role in transplant rejection .

Type 1 immunity is directed primarily at viruses , bacteria , and protozoa and is responsible for activating macrophages , turning them into potent effector cells. This is achieved by the secretion of interferon gamma and TNF .

[ citation needed ] Overview [ edit ] CD4 + T-helper cells may be differentiated into two main categories: [ 5 ] T H 1 cells which produce interferon gamma and lymphotoxin alpha , T H 2 cells which produce IL-4 , IL-5 , and IL-13 .

A third category called T helper 17 cells (T H 17) were also discovered which are named after their secretion of Interleukin 17 .

CD8 + cytotoxic T-cells may also be categorized as: [ 5 ] T c 1 cells, T c 2 cells.

Similarly to CD4 + T H cells, a third category called T C 17 were discovered that also secrete IL-17.

As for the ILCs , they [Clarification needed.] may be classified into three main categories [ 5 ] ILC1 which secrete type 1 cytokines, ILC2 which secrete type 2 cytokines, ILC3 which secrete type 17 cytokines.

Development of cells [ edit ] All type 1 cells begin their development from the common lymphoid progenitor (CLp) which then differentiates to become the common innate lymphoid progenitor (CILp) and the t-cell progenitor (Tp) through the process of lymphopoiesis .

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] Common innate lymphoid progenitors may then be differentiated into a natural killer progenitor (NKp) or a common helper like innate lymphoid progenitor (CHILp). NKp cells may then be induced to differentiate into natural killer cells by IL-15 . CHILp cells may be induced to differentiate into ILC1 cells by IL-15 , into ILC2 cells by IL-7 or ILC3 cells by IL-7 as well.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] T-cell progenitors may differentiate into naïve CD8 + cells or naïve CD4 + cells. Naïve CD8 + cells may then further differentiate into T C 1 cells upon IL-12 exposure, [IL-4] can induce the differentiation into T C 2 cells and IL-1 or IL-23 can induce the differentiation into T C 17 cells. Naïve CD4 + cells may differentiate into T H 1 cells upon IL-12 exposure, T H 2 upon IL-4 exposure or T H 17 upon IL-1 or IL-23 exposure.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] Type 1 immunity [ edit ] Type 1 immunity makes use of the type 1 subset for each of these cell types. By secreting interferon gamma and TNF , T H 1, T C 1, and group 1 ILCS activate macrophages, converting them to potent effector cells.  It provides defense against intracellular bacteria , protozoa , and viruses . It is also responsible for inflammation and autoimmunity with diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis , multiple sclerosis , and inflammatory bowel disease all being implicated in type 1 immunity. Type 1 immunity consists of these cells: [ 5 ] CD4+ T H 1 cells CD8 + cytotoxic T cells (T c 1) T-Bet + interferon gamma producing group 1 ILCs(ILC1 and Natural killer cells) CD4 + T H 1 Cells It has been found in both mice and humans that the signature cytokines for these cells are interferon gamma and lymphotoxin alpha . The main cytokine for differentiation into T H 1 cells is IL-12 which is produced by dendritic cells in response to the activation of pattern recognition receptors .

T-bet is a distinctive transcription factor of T H 1 cells. T H 1 cells are also characterized by the expression of chemokine receptors which allow their movement to sites of inflammation. The main chemokine receptors on these cells are CXCR3A and CCR5 .

Epithelial cells and keratinocytes are able to recruit T H 1 cells to sites of infection by releasing the chemokines CXCL9 , CXCL10 and CXCL11 in response to interferon gamma . Additionally, interferon gamma secreted by these cells seems to be important in downregulating tight junctions in the epithelial barrier.

[ 5 ] CD8 + T C 1 Cells These cells generally produce interferon gamma . Interferon gamma and IL-12 promote differentiation toward T C 1 cells.

T-bet activation is required for both interferon gamma and cytolytic potential.

CCR5 and CXCR3 are the main chemokine receptors for this cell.

[ 5 ] Group 1 ILCs Groups 1 ILCs are defined to include ILCs expressing the transcription factor T-bet and were originally thought to only include natural killer cells . Recently, there have been a large amount of NKp46 + cells that express certain master [transcription factor]s that allow them to be designated as a distinct lineage of natural killer cells termed ILC1s. ILC1s are characterized by the ability to produce interferon gamma , TNF , GM-CSF and IL-2 in response to cytokine stimulation but have low or no cytotoxic ability.
