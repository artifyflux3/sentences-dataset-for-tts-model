The **semicolon****;** (or **semi-colon**[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_note-1)) is a symbol commonly used as [orthographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthography "Orthography")[punctuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punctuation "Punctuation"). In the [English language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language "English language"), a semicolon is most commonly used to link (in a single sentence) two independent clauses that are closely related in thought, such as when restating the preceding idea with a different expression. When a semicolon joins two or more ideas in one sentence, those ideas are then given equal rank.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_note-2) Semicolons can also be used in place of commas to separate items in a list, particularly when the elements of the list themselves have embedded [commas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma "Comma").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_note-3)

The semicolon is one of the least understood of the [standard marks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_punctuation "English punctuation"), and is not frequently used by many [English speakers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_speakers "English speakers").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_note-4)

In the [QWERTY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTY "QWERTY")[keyboard layout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_layout "Keyboard layout"), the semicolon resides in the [unshifted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift_key "Shift key")[homerow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homerow "Homerow") beneath the little finger of the right hand. It has become widely used in [programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language "Programming language") as a [statement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statement_(programming) "Statement (programming)") separator or terminator.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_note-c-sharp-introduction-5)

De Ætna. 1496 print by [Aldine Press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldine_Press "Aldine Press").

In 1496,[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_note-9) the semicolon ; is attested in [Pietro Bembo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pietro_Bembo "Pietro Bembo")'s book _[De Aetna](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=De\_Aetna&action=edit&redlink=1 "De Aetna (page does not exist)")[[it](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/De\_Aetna "it:De Aetna")]_ printed by [Aldo Manuzio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldus_Manutius "Aldus Manutius").[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_note-10)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_note-Kidwell-6) The punctuation also appears in later writings of Bembo. Moreover, it is used in 1507 by [Bartolomeo Sanvito](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartolomeo_Sanvito "Bartolomeo Sanvito"), who was close to Manuzio's circle.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_note-parkes-11): 49

In 1561, Manuzio's grandson, also called [Aldo Manuzio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldus_Manutius_the_Younger "Aldus Manutius the Younger"), explains the semicolon's use with several examples in _Orthographiae ratio_. In particular, Manuzio motivates the need for punctuation (_[interpungō](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/interpungo#Latin "wikt:interpungo")_) to divide (_[distinguō](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/distinguo#Latin "wikt:distinguo")_) sentences and thereby make them understandable. The [comma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma "Comma"), semicolon, [colon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation) "Colon (punctuation)"), and [period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop "Full stop") are seen as steps, ascending from low to high; the semicolon thereby being an intermediate value between the comma , and colon :. Here are four examples used in the book to illustrate this:[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_note-manuzio-12)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_note-parkes-11): 49

Around 1580, [Henry Denham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Denham "Henry Denham") starts using the semicolon "with propriety" for English texts, and more widespread usage picks up in the next decades.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_note-parkes-11): 52 [[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_note-17)

Around 1640,[[f]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_note-19) in [Ben Jonson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Jonson "Ben Jonson")'s book _The English Grammar_, the character ; is described as "somewhat a longer breath" compared to the [comma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma "Comma"). The aim of the breathing, according to Jonson, is to aid understanding.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_note-jonson1692-20)[[g]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_note-22)

In 1644, in Richard Hodges' _The English Primrose_, it is written:[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_note-23)

> At a comma, stop a little; [...] At a semi-colon, somewhat more; [...] At a colon, a little more than the former; [...] At a period, make a full stop;

In 1762, in [Robert Lowth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Lowth "Robert Lowth")'s _A Short Introduction to English Grammar_, a parallel is drawn between [punctuation marks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punctuation "Punctuation") and [rest in music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rest_(music) "Rest (music)"):[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_note-24)

> The [Period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop "Full stop") is a pause in quantity or duration double of the [Colon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation) "Colon (punctuation)"); the Colon is double of the Semicolon; and the Semicolon is double of the [Comma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma "Comma"). So that they are in the same proportion to one another as the [Sembrief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_note "Whole note"), the [Minim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half_note "Half note"), the [Crotchet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarter_note "Quarter note"), and the [Quaver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighth_note "Eighth note"), in Music.

In 1798, in [Lindley Murray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindley_Murray "Lindley Murray")'s _English Grammar_, the semicolon is introduced as follows:[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_note-25)

> The Semicolon is used for dividing a [compound sentence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_sentences "Compound sentences") into two or more parts, not so closely connected as those which are separated by a comma, nor yet so little dependent on each other, as those which are distinguished by a colon.
> 
> 
> The semicolon is sometimes used, when the preceding member of the sentence does not of itself give a complete sense, but depends on the following [clause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clause "Clause"); and sometimes when the sense of that member would be complete without the concluding one; as in the following instances.

Although terminal marks (i.e. [full stops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop "Full stop"), [exclamation marks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark "Exclamation mark"), and [question marks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark "Question mark")) indicate the end of a sentence, the [comma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma "Comma"), semicolon, and [colon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation) "Colon (punctuation)") are normally inside sentences, making them secondary boundary marks. In modern English orthography, the semicolon falls between terminal marks and the comma; its strength is equal to that of the colon.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_note-26)

The most common use of the semicolon is to join two independent clauses without using a conjunction such as "and".[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_note-27) Semicolons are followed by a [lower case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_case "Lower case") letter, unless that letter would ordinarily be capitalised mid-sentence (e.g., the word "I", acronyms/initialisms, or [proper nouns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_noun "Proper noun")). In older English printed texts, colons and semicolons are offset from the preceding word by a non-breaking space, a convention still current in modern continental French texts. Ideally, the space is less wide than the inter-word spaces. Some guides recommend separation by a [hair space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_space "Hair space").[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_note-28) Modern [style guides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_guide "Style guide") recommend no space before them and one space after. They also typically recommend placing semicolons outside ending [quotation marks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark "Quotation mark"), although this was not always the case. For example, the first edition of _[The Chicago Manual of Style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Chicago\_Manual\_of\_Style "The Chicago Manual of Style")_ (1906) recommended placing the semicolon inside ending quotation marks.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_note-29)

Uses of the semicolon in English include:

*   Between items in a series or listing when the items contain internal [punctuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punctuation "Punctuation"), especially parenthetic commas, where the semicolons function as the [serial commas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma "Serial comma") for the series or listing. The semicolon divides the items on the list from each other, to avoid having a jumble of commas with differing functions which could cause confusion for the reader. This is sometimes called the "super comma" function of the semicolon: 
    *   The people present were Jamie, a man from New Zealand; John, the milkman's son; and George, a gaunt kind of man with no friends.
    *   Several fast food restaurants can be found within the following cities: London, England; Paris, France; Dublin, Ireland; and Madrid, Spain.
    *   Here are three examples of familiar sequences: one, two, and three; a, b, and c; first, second, and third.
    *   (Fig. 8; see also plates in Harley 1941, 1950; Schwab 1947).

*   Between closely related [independent clauses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_clause "Independent clause") not conjoined with a [coordinating conjunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_conjunction "Grammatical conjunction"), when the two clauses are [balanced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balanced_sentences "Balanced sentences"), opposed or contradictory:[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_note-purdue.edu-30)
    *   My wife said she would like tea; coffee would have been my choice.
    *   I went to the basketball court; it was closed for cleaning.
    *   I told Kate she's running for the hills; she knew I was joking.

*   In rare instances, when a comma replaces a period (full stop) in a quotation, or when a quotation otherwise links two independent sentences: 
    *   "I have no use for this," he said; "you are welcome to it."
    *   "Is this your book?" she asked; "I found it on the floor."

In a list or sequence, if even one item needs its own internal comma, use of the semicolon as the separator throughout that list is justified, as shown by this example from the [California Penal Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Penal_Code "California Penal Code"):

> A crime or public offense is an act committed or omitted in violation of a law forbidding or commanding it, and to which is annexed, upon conviction, either of the following punishments:
> 
> 
> 1.   Death;
> 2.   Imprisonment;
> 3.   Fine;
> 4.   Removal from office; or,
> 5.   Disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust, or profit in this State.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_note-31)

In [Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic "Arabic"), the semicolon is called _fasila manqoota_ (Arabic: فاصلة منقوطة) which means literally "a dotted comma", and is written inverted ؛. In Arabic, the semicolon has several uses:

*   It can be used between two clauses, in which the first clause causes the second. 
    *   Example: "He played a lot; so, his clothes became dirty". (Arabic: لَعِبَ كَثِيرًا؛ فَٱتَّسَخَتْ مَلَابِسُهُ.)

*   It can be used between two clauses, where the second is _a reason_ for the first. 
    *   Example: "Your sister did not get high marks; she didn't study". (Arabic: لم تحقق أختك درجات عالية؛ لأنها لم تدرس .)

### Greek and Church Slavonic

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Semicolon&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Greek and Church Slavonic")]

In [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language "Greek language") and [Church Slavonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_Slavonic_language "Church Slavonic language"), the [Greek question mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_question_mark "Greek question mark") (;) looks exactly like a Latin semicolon.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_note-32)[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_note-Truss_2004_111-33) (To indicate a long pause or to separate sections that already contain commas (the semicolon's purposes in English), Greek uses, but extremely rarely, the 'upper dot' (Greek: άνω τελεία, romanized:_áno teleía_), **·**, which looks very similar to the Latin [interpunct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpunct "Interpunct").[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_note-34))

For example:

*   Church Slavonic sentence ending with a question mark: гдѣ єсть рождeйсѧ царь їудeйскій; (Where is the one who is born king of the Jews? – [Matthew 2:1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_2:1 "Matthew 2:1"))
*   Greek sentence ending with a question mark: Τι είναι μια διασύνδεση; (What is a connection?)

In French, a semicolon (_point-virgule_, literally "dot-comma") is a separation between two full sentences, used where neither a colon nor a comma would be appropriate. The phrase following a semicolon has to be an independent clause, related to the previous one but not explaining it. (When the second clause explains the first one, French consistently uses a [colon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation) "Colon (punctuation)").)

The [dash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dash "Dash") character is used in French writing too, but not as widely as the semicolon. Usage of these devices (semicolon and dash) varies from author to author.

> Just as there are writers who worship the semicolon, there are other high stylists who dismiss it — who label it, if you please, middle-class.

Some authors have avoided and rejected the use of the semicolon throughout their works. [Lynne Truss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynne_Truss "Lynne Truss") stated:

> [Samuel Beckett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Beckett "Samuel Beckett") spliced his way merrily through such novels as _Molloy_ and _Malone Dies_, thumbing his nose at the semicolon all the way. [James Joyce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Joyce "James Joyce") preferred the colon, as he thought it was more authentically classical. [P. G. Wodehouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._G._Wodehouse "P. G. Wodehouse") did an effortlessly marvelous job without it, [George Orwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Orwell "George Orwell") tried to avoid the semicolon completely in _[Coming Up for Air](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming\_Up\_for\_Air "Coming Up for Air")_ (1939), [Martin Amis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Amis "Martin Amis") included just one semicolon in _[Money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money\_(novel) "Money (novel)")_ (1984), and [Umberto Eco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umberto_Eco "Umberto Eco") was congratulated by an academic reader for using zero semicolons in _[The Name of the Rose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Name\_of\_the\_Rose "The Name of the Rose")_ (1983).[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_note-FOOTNOTETruss200488,_108%E2%80%93109-36)

In response to Truss, [Ben Macintyre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Macintyre "Ben Macintyre"), a columnist in _[The Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Times "The Times")_, wrote:

> Americans have long regarded the semi-colon with suspicion, as a genteel, self-conscious, neither-one-thing-nor-the other sort of punctuation mark, with neither the butchness of a full colon nor the flighty promiscuity of the comma. [Hemingway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Hemingway "Ernest Hemingway"), [Chandler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Chandler "Raymond Chandler"), and [Stephen King](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_King "Stephen King") wouldn't be seen dead in a ditch with a semi-colon (though [Truman Capote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truman_Capote "Truman Capote") might). Real men, goes the unwritten rule of American punctuation, don't use semi-colons.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_note-37)

Semicolon use in British fiction has declined by 25% from 1991 to 2021.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_note-Lloyd-38)

In Unicode, the semicolon is encoded at U+003B;SEMICOLON which is the same value it also had in [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII "ASCII") and [ISO 8859-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8859-1 "ISO 8859-1").

Unicode contains encoding for several other semicolon or semicolon-like characters:

In [computer programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming "Computer programming"), the semicolon is often used to separate multiple [statements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statement_(programming) "Statement (programming)") (for example, in [Perl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl "Perl"),[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_note-perl-40)[Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language) "Pascal (programming language)"),[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_note-pascal-41) and [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL "SQL");[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_note-sql-42) see [Pascal: Semicolons as statement separators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)#Semicolons_as_statement_separators "Pascal (programming language)")). In other languages, semicolons are called _terminator_ s[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_note-c-sharp-introduction-5) and are required after every statement (such as in [PL/I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PL/I "PL/I"),[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_note-43)[Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language) "Java (programming language)"),[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_note-java-44) and the [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language) "C (programming language)")[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_note-c99-45) family). Today semicolons as terminators has largely won out, but this was a divisive issue in programming languages from the 1960s into the 1980s.[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_note-46) An influential and frequently cited study in this debate was [Gannon & Horning (1975)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#CITEREFGannonHorning1975), which concluded strongly in favor of semicolon as a terminator: "The most important [result] was that having a semicolon as a statement terminator was better than having a semicolon as a statement separator."[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_note-47) The study has been criticized as flawed by proponents of semicolon as a separator,[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_note-plde-48) due to participants being familiar with a semicolon-as-terminator language and unrealistically strict grammar. Nevertheless, the debate ended in favor of semicolon as terminator. Therefore, semicolon provides structure to the programming language.

Semicolons are optional in a number of languages, including [BCPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BCPL "BCPL"),[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_note-bpcl-49)[Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language) "Python (programming language)"),[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_note-python-50)[R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language) "R (programming language)"),[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_note-r-51)[Eiffel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiffel_(programming_language) "Eiffel (programming language)"),[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_note-eiffel-52) and [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language) "Go (programming language)"),[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_note-go-53) meaning that they are part of the [formal grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_grammar "Formal grammar") for the language but can be inferred in many or all contexts (e.g., by end of line that ends a statement, as in Go and R). As languages can be designed without them, semicolons are considered an unnecessary nuisance by some.[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_note-plde-48)

The use of semicolons in control-flow structures and blocks of code is varied– semicolons are generally omitted after a closing brace, but included for a single statement branch of a control structure (the "then" clause), except in Pascal, where a semicolon terminates the entire if-then-else clause (to avoid [dangling else](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangling_else "Dangling else")) and thus is not allowed between a "then" and the corresponding "else", as this causes unnesting.

This use originates with [ALGOL 60](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALGOL_60 "ALGOL 60")[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_note-algol-54) and falls between the comma ,– used as a list separator– and the period/full stop .– used to mark the end of the program. The semicolon, as a mark separating statements, corresponds to the ordinary English usage of separating independent clauses and gives the entire program the gross syntax of a single ordinary sentence. Of these other characters, whereas commas have continued to be widely used in programming for lists (and rare other uses, such as the [comma operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma_operator "Comma operator") that separates expressions in C), they are rarely used otherwise, and the period as the end of the program has fallen out of use. The last major use of the comma, semicolon, and period hierarchy is in [Erlang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_(programming_language) "Erlang (programming language)") (1986), where commas separate expressions; semicolons separate clauses, both for control flow and for function clauses; and periods terminate statements, such as function definitions or module attributes, not the entire program. Drawbacks of having multiple different separators or terminators (compared to a single terminator and single grouping, as in semicolon-and-braces) include mental overhead in selecting punctuation, and overhead in rearranging code, as this requires not only moving lines around, but also updating the punctuation.[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_note-55)

In some cases the distinction between a separator and a terminator is strong, such as early versions of Pascal, where a final semicolon yields a [syntax error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_error "Syntax error"). In other cases a final semicolon is treated either as optional syntax or as being followed by a null statement, which is either ignored or treated as a [NOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOP_(code) "NOP (code)") (no operation or null command); compare [trailing commas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailing_comma "Trailing comma") in lists. In some cases a blank statement is allowed, allowing a sequence of semicolons or the use of a semicolon by itself as the body of a control-flow structure. For example, a blank statement (a semicolon by itself) stands for a NOP in C/C++, which is useful in [busy waiting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_waiting "Busy waiting")[synchronization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronization "Synchronization") loops.

[APL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_(programming_language) "APL (programming language)") uses semicolons to separate declarations of local variables[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_note-apl-56): 61  and to separate axes when indexing multidimensional arrays, for example, `matrix[2;3]`.[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_note-apl-56): 220, 275

Other languages (for instance, some [assembly languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language "Assembly language")[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_note-nasm-57) and [LISP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language) "Lisp (programming language)")[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_note-common-lisp-58) dialects, [CONFIG.SYS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/;_(CONFIG.SYS_directive) "; (CONFIG.SYS directive)") and [INI files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file#Comments "INI file")) use semicolons to mark the beginning of [comments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comment_(computer_programming) "Comment (computer programming)").

Example [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language) "C (programming language)") code:

int main() {
 int x, y;
 x = 1; y = 2;
 printf("X + Y = %d", x + y);
 return 0;
}

Or in [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript "JavaScript"):

var x = 1; var y = 2;
alert("X + Y = " + (x + y));

Conventionally, in many languages, each statement is written on a separate line, but this is not typically a requirement of the language. In the above examples, two statements are placed on the same line; this is legal, because the semicolon separates the two statements. Thus programming languages like Java, the C family, Javascript etc. use semicolons to obtain a proper structure in the respective languages.

The semicolon is often used to separate elements of a string of text. For example, multiple e-mail addresses in the "To" field in some e-mail clients have to be [delimited](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delimiter "Delimiter") by a semicolon.

In [Microsoft Excel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Excel "Microsoft Excel"), the semicolon is used as a list separator, especially in cases where the decimal separator is a comma, such as `0,32; 3,14; 4,50`, instead of `0.32, 3.14, 4.50`.

In [Lua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_(programming_language) "Lua (programming language)"),[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_note-lua-59) semicolons or commas can be used to separate table elements.

In [MATLAB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MATLAB "MATLAB") and [GNU Octave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Octave "GNU Octave"),[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_note-octave-60) the semicolon can be used as a row separator when defining a vector or matrix (whereas a comma separates the columns within a row of a vector or matrix) or to execute a command silently, without displaying the resulting output value in the console.

In [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML "HTML"), a semicolon is used to terminate a [character entity reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_entity_reference "Character entity reference"), either named or numeric.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_note-mdn-61) The declarations of a style attribute in [Cascading Style Sheets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets "Cascading Style Sheets") (CSS) are separated and terminated with semicolons.[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_note-62)

The file system of [RSX-11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSX-11 "RSX-11") and [OpenVMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenVMS "OpenVMS"), [Files-11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Files-11 "Files-11"), uses semicolons to indicate a [file's version number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Versioning_file_system "Versioning file system").[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_note-63) The semicolon is permitted in [long filenames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_filename "Long filename") in the [Microsoft Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows "Microsoft Windows") file systems [NTFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTFS "NTFS") and [VFAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VFAT "VFAT"), but not in its [short names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8.3_filename "8.3 filename").[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_note-64)

In some [delimiter-separated values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delimiter-separated_values "Delimiter-separated values") file formats, the semicolon is used as the separator character, as an alternative to [comma-separated values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values "Comma-separated values").

In mathematical derivations, a semicolon is used to separate expressions in a sequence, similar to its use in spoken English, and may be considered either punctuation for the mathematical expressions, or as punctuation for the words spoken when reading the expressions. For example, [completing the square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Completing_the_square "Completing the square"):

In the argument list of a mathematical [function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics) "Function (mathematics)")![Image 6: {\displaystyle \ f(x_{1},\ x_{2},\ \dots \ ;\ a_{1},\ a_{2},\ \dots )\;,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/99d7473e7c70f85c2747ee710e7f352749c1660c) a semicolon may be used to separate [variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics) "Variable (mathematics)") from fixed [parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter#Mathematical_functions "Parameter").[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

In [differential geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry "Differential geometry") and [tensor analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_analysis "Tensor analysis"), a semicolon preceding an [index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indexed_family "Indexed family") is used to indicate the [covariant derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariant_derivative "Covariant derivative") of a function with respect to the [coordinate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate "Coordinate") associated with that index.

In the [calculus of relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_of_relations "Calculus of relations"), the semicolon is used in [infix notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infix_notation "Infix notation") for the [composition of relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_of_relations "Composition of relations"): ![Image 7: {\displaystyle A;B\ =\ \{(x,z):\exists y\ \ xAy\ \land \ yBz\}~.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3190b5f6b6374f2d6085b1423ebc4bd2741bea97)

In [piecewise functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piecewise_functions "Piecewise functions"), a semicolon or comma may follow the subfunction or subdomain; the ![Image 8: {\displaystyle {\text{if}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/70219120a6ceff9ae7ba8f4e5b3b132d270e88fc) or ![Image 9: {\displaystyle {\text{for}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b6d5931f40f817629b0dc425026c5b2a7cbe6718) can be omitted, in which case it seems replaced by the semicolon or comma.[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_note-65)

The ;_[Humphrey point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humphrey\_point "Humphrey point")_ is sometimes used as the "[decimal point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_point "Decimal point")" in [duodecimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duodecimal "Duodecimal") numbers: 54;6 12 equals 64.5 10.

The semicolon is commonly used as part of [emoticons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoticon "Emoticon") in order to indicate [winking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wink "Wink") or crying, as in `;)` and `;_;`.

[Project Semicolon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Semicolon "Project Semicolon") is the name of an anti-[suicide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide "Suicide") initiative (since the semicolon continues a sentence rather than ending it) which has led to the punctuation mark becoming a highly symbolic and popular [tattoo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tattoo "Tattoo") (most commonly done on the [wrist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrist "Wrist")). While some consider this to be faith-based,[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_note-The_Semicolon_Project-66) the movement is in general faith-neutral and inclusive of all people.

1.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_ref-9 "Jump up")**Note: this is February 1495 by the [Venetian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venetian_calendar "Venetian calendar"), or MVD in [Roman numerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals "Roman numerals"). Several texts mention the earliest printing year as 1494 without any attested source. This may be due to a misunderstanding: the text _De Aetna_ itself recalls a conversation from September 1494 ([Gregorian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar "Gregorian calendar")); the earliest attested printing occurred in February 1496 ([Gregorian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar "Gregorian calendar")).[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_note-Kidwell-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_note-7) See also the [colophon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colophon_(publishing) "Colophon (publishing)") at the end of the book: _impressum venetiis in aedibus aldi romani mense februario anno M.V.D._ ("printed in Venice at the [house of Aldo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldine_Press "Aldine Press") in February 1495 [[m.v.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/More_veneto "More veneto")]").[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_note-8)
2.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_ref-13 "Jump up")**Manuzio notes: using just commas here is not sufficient, and using a colon instead of a semicolon would slow down the sentence too much.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_note-manuzio-12)
3.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_ref-14 "Jump up")**Manuzio notes: if there were a comma after _non esse_, then the sentence would be as if rushed forward head-first; however, since the sentence is in two parts, it must stop for a little bit before continuing. Moreover, he says, we can't use a colon, since _Ratio docet_ governs both parts of the sentence equally, not just the first.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_note-manuzio-12)
4.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_ref-15 "Jump up")**Manuzio shows another example of where we need a semicolon instead of a colon; _Tu_ and _spectas_ govern both parts of the sentence equally.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_note-manuzio-12)
5.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_ref-16 "Jump up")**Manuzio notes, this passage is taken from [Cicero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicero "Cicero")'s letter to Torquatus (see _[Epistulae ad Familiares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistulae\_ad\_Familiares "Epistulae ad Familiares")_). He uses this example, he says, to show situations where both the semicolon and colon are needed for division.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_note-manuzio-12)
6.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_ref-19 "Jump up")**According to the [British Library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Library "British Library"), the book was "written in 1623 and lost in a fire, but rewritten and published after Jonson's death".[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_note-18)
7.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_ref-22 "Jump up")**The 1640 version of the text calls the character ; a _sub-distinction_,[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_note-jonson_1640-21) the 1692 version names it a _semicolon_.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_note-jonson1692-20) Moreover, the order of the comma and semicolon seem to have been reversed by mistake in the 1640 version. Thus, the comma is mistakenly described as having a longer breathe than the semicolon.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon#cite_note-jonson_1640-21)

A semicolon is most commonly used to link (in a single sentence) two independent clauses that are closely related in thought. When a semicolon is used to join two or more ideas (parts) in a sentence, those ideas are then given equal position or rank.
