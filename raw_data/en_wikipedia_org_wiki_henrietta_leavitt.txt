**Henrietta Swan Leavitt** (; July 4, 1868 – December 12, 1921) was an American [astronomer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomer "Astronomer").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Leavitt#cite_note-Maths_History_1921-2)[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Leavitt#cite_note-NYT-20240327-1)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Leavitt#cite_note-3) Her discovery of how to effectively measure vast astronomical distances led to a shift in the understanding of the scale and nature of the universe.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Leavitt#cite_note-carnegiescience-4) Nomination of Leavitt for the Nobel Prize had to be halted because of her death.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Leavitt#cite_note-Singh-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Leavitt#cite_note-Johnson-6)

A graduate of [Radcliffe College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radcliffe_College "Radcliffe College"), she worked at the [Harvard College Observatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_College_Observatory "Harvard College Observatory") as a [human computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_(occupation) "Computer (occupation)"), tasked with measuring [photographic plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photographic_plate "Photographic plate") to catalog the positions and brightness of stars. This work led her to discover the relation between the [luminosity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminosity "Luminosity") and the period of [Cepheid variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cepheid_variable "Cepheid variable"). Leavitt's discovery provided astronomers with the first [standard candle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_distance_ladder "Cosmic distance ladder") with which to measure the distance to other [galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy "Galaxy").[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Leavitt#cite_note-1777Variables-7)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Leavitt#cite_note-VariableStars-8)

Before Leavitt discovered the [period-luminosity relationship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Period-luminosity_relation "Period-luminosity relation") for [Cepheid variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cepheid_variable "Cepheid variable") (sometimes referred to as Leavitt's Law), the only techniques available to astronomers for measuring the distance to a star were based on [stellar parallax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_parallax "Stellar parallax"). Such techniques can only be used for measuring distances out to several hundred [light years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_year "Light year"). Leavitt's great insight was that while no one knew the distance to the [Small Magellanic Cloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Magellanic_Cloud "Small Magellanic Cloud"), all its stars must be roughly the same distance from Earth. Therefore, a relationship she discovered in it, between the period of certain variable stars (Cepheids) and their apparent brightness, reflected a relationship in their absolute brightness. Once calibrated by measuring the distance to a nearby star of the same type via parallax, her discovery became a measuring stick with vastly greater reach.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Leavitt#cite_note-PLhistory-9)

After Leavitt's death, [Edwin Hubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble "Edwin Hubble") found Cepheids in several nebulae, including the [Andromeda Nebula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy "Andromeda Galaxy"), and, using Leavitt's Law, calculated that their distance was far too great to be part of the Milky Way and were separate galaxies in their own right. This settled astronomy's [Great Debate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Debate_(astronomy) "Great Debate (astronomy)") over the size of the universe. Hubble later used Leavitt's Law, together with galactic [redshifts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift "Redshift"), to establish that the universe is expanding (see [Hubble's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble%27s_law "Hubble's law"))[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_].

The [observatory at Harvard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_College_Observatory "Harvard College Observatory") where Henrietta Swan Leavitt worked

Henrietta Swan Leavitt was born in [Lancaster, Massachusetts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancaster,_Massachusetts "Lancaster, Massachusetts"), the daughter of Henrietta Swan Kendrick and [Congregational church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congregational_church "Congregational church") minister George Roswell Leavitt.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Leavitt#cite_note-CSMonitor-10) She was a descendant of Deacon [John Leavitt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Leavitt "John Leavitt"), an English [Puritan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puritan "Puritan") tailor, who settled in the [Massachusetts Bay Colony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Bay_Colony "Massachusetts Bay Colony") in the early seventeenth century.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Leavitt#cite_note-Byers-11) (In the early Massachusetts records the family name was spelled "Levett".) Henrietta Leavitt remained deeply religious and committed to her church throughout her life.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Leavitt#cite_note-Lightman2010-12)

Leavitt attended [Oberlin College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberlin_College "Oberlin College") for two years before transferring to [Harvard University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University "Harvard University")'s [Society for the Collegiate Instruction of Women](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_for_the_Collegiate_Instruction_of_Women "Society for the Collegiate Instruction of Women") (later [Radcliffe College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radcliffe_College "Radcliffe College")), where she received a bachelor degree in 1892.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Leavitt#cite_note-Singh-5) At Oberlin and Harvard, Leavitt studied a broad curriculum that included [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin "Latin") and classical Greek, fine arts, philosophy, [analytic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_geometry "Analytic geometry"), and calculus.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Leavitt#cite_note-carnegiescience-4)[_[failed verification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability "Wikipedia:Verifiability")_] In her fourth year of college, Leavitt took a course in astronomy, in which she earned an A−.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Leavitt#cite_note-Johnson-6): 27

[![Image 4](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/Astronomer_Edward_Charles_Pickering%27s_Harvard_computers.jpg/250px-Astronomer_Edward_Charles_Pickering%27s_Harvard_computers.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Astronomer_Edward_Charles_Pickering%27s_Harvard_computers.jpg)

Henrietta Leavitt (_third from left_) is shown working among "The Harvard Computers" who assisted astronomer Edward Charles Pickering at the Harvard College Observatory. The assistants also included [Annie Jump Cannon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_Jump_Cannon "Annie Jump Cannon"), [Williamina Fleming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williamina_Fleming "Williamina Fleming"), and [Antonia Maury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonia_Maury "Antonia Maury").

Leavitt also began working as volunteer assistant, one of the ["computers"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Computers "Harvard Computers") at the [Harvard College Observatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_College_Observatory "Harvard College Observatory").[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Leavitt#cite_note-13) In 1902, she was hired by the director of the observatory, [Edward Charles Pickering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Charles_Pickering "Edward Charles Pickering"), to measure and catalog the brightness of stars as they appeared in the observatory's [photographic plate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photographic_plate "Photographic plate") collection. (In the early 1900s, women were not allowed to operate telescopes,[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Leavitt#cite_note-mcneill-14) but the scientific data were on the photographic plates.)[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Leavitt#cite_note-Exploratorium-15)[_[dubious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Accuracy\_dispute#Disputed\_statement "Wikipedia:Accuracy dispute") – [discuss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Henrietta\_Swan\_Leavitt#quote:\_women\_were\_not\_allowed\_to\_operate\_telescopes "Talk:Henrietta Swan Leavitt")_]

In 1893, Leavitt obtained credits toward a graduate degree in astronomy for her work at the Harvard College Observatory, but due to chronic illness, she never completed that degree.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Leavitt#cite_note-Kidwell-16) In 1898, she became a member of the Harvard staff. Leavitt left the observatory to make two trips to Europe and completed a stint as an art assistant at [Beloit College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beloit_College "Beloit College") in Wisconsin. At this time, she contracted an illness that led to progressive [hearing loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_loss "Hearing loss").[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Leavitt#cite_note-Hockey-17)[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Leavitt#cite_note-Hamblin-18) Leavitt gradually became deaf.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Leavitt#cite_note-Johnson-6): 28, 31, 44

Astronomical career
-------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Henrietta_Swan_Leavitt&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Astronomical career")]

[![Image 5: Woman sitting at desk writing, with short hair, long-sleeved white blouse and vest](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Leavitt_henrietta_b1.jpg/330px-Leavitt_henrietta_b1.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Leavitt_henrietta_b1.jpg)

Leavitt working at her desk in the Harvard College Observatory[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Leavitt#cite_note-Hamblin-18)

Leavitt returned to the Harvard College Observatory in 1903. Because Leavitt was financially independent, Pickering initially did not have to pay her. Later, she received $0.30 (equivalent to $10.5 in 2024) an hour for her work,[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Leavitt#cite_note-Johnson-6): 32  and only $10.50 (equivalent to $367.46 in 2024) per week. She was reportedly "hard-working, serious-minded …, little given to frivolous pursuits and selflessly devoted to her family, her church, and her career."[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Leavitt#cite_note-carnegiescience-4) At the Harvard Observatory, Leavitt worked alongside [Annie Jump Cannon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_Jump_Cannon "Annie Jump Cannon"), who also was deaf.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Leavitt#cite_note-Sobel-19)

Pickering assigned Leavitt to study [variable stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_star "Variable star") of the [Small](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Magellanic_Cloud "Small Magellanic Cloud") and [Large Magellanic Clouds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Magellanic_Cloud "Large Magellanic Cloud"), as recorded on photographic plates taken with the Bruce Astrograph of the [Boyden Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyden_Station "Boyden Station") of the Harvard Observatory in [Arequipa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arequipa "Arequipa"), [Peru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peru "Peru"). She identified 1,777 variable stars. In 1908, Leavitt published the results of her studies in the _Annals of the Astronomical Observatory of Harvard College_, noting that the brighter variables had the longer period.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Leavitt#cite_note-1777Variables-7)

[![Image 6](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/HSLeavittHSCr13Fig2_1912.jpg/250px-HSLeavittHSCr13Fig2_1912.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:HSLeavittHSCr13Fig2_1912.jpg)

**Plot from a paper prepared by Leavitt in 1912** - The horizontal axis is the logarithm of the period of the corresponding Cepheid, and the vertical axis is its [magnitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnitude_(astronomy) "Magnitude (astronomy)"). The lines drawn connect points corresponding respectively to the stars' minimum and maximum brightness.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Leavitt#cite_note-VariableStars-8)[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Leavitt#cite_note-20)

In a 1912 paper, Leavitt examined the relationship between the periods and the brightness of a sample of 25 of the Cepheid variables in the [Small Magellanic Cloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Magellanic_Cloud "Small Magellanic Cloud"). The paper was communicated and signed by Edward Pickering, but the first sentence indicates that it was "prepared by Miss Leavitt".[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Leavitt#cite_note-VariableStars-8) Leavitt made a graph of magnitude versus logarithm of period and determined that, in her own words,

> A straight line can be readily drawn among each of the two series of points corresponding to maxima and minima, thus showing that there is a simple relation between the brightness of the [Cepheid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cepheid "Cepheid") variables and their periods.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Leavitt#cite_note-VariableStars-8)

Leavitt then used the simplifying assumption that all of the Cepheids within the Small Magellanic Cloud were at approximately the same distance, so that their [intrinsic brightness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrinsic_brightness "Intrinsic brightness") could be deduced from their [apparent brightness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_brightness "Apparent brightness") as registered in the photographic plates, up to a scale factor, since the distance to the Magellanic Clouds were as yet unknown. She expressed the hope that [parallaxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax_in_astronomy "Parallax in astronomy") to some Cepheids would be measured. This soon occurred,[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Leavitt#cite_note-PLhistory-9) allowing her period-luminosity scale to be calibrated.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Leavitt#cite_note-VariableStars-8) This reasoning allowed Leavitt to establish that the [logarithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm "Logarithm") of the [period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency "Frequency") is linearly related to the logarithm of the star's average intrinsic optical [luminosity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminosity "Luminosity") (the amount of power radiated by the star in the [visible spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visible_spectrum "Visible spectrum")).[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Leavitt#cite_note-21)

Henrietta found that [Delta Cepheus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Cephei "Delta Cephei") was the "[standard candle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminosity "Luminosity")" that had long been sought by astronomers. A similar five-day [cepheid variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cepheid_variable "Cepheid variable") in the Small [Magellanic cloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magellanic_Clouds "Magellanic Clouds") she found to be about one ten-thousandth as bright as our five-day Delta Cepheus. Using the [inverse-square law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse-square_law "Inverse-square law"), she calculated that the Small Magellanic cloud was 100 times as far away as Delta Cepheus, thus having discovered a way to calculate the distance to another galaxy.

Leavitt also developed, and continued to refine, the Harvard Standard for photographic measurements, a logarithmic scale that orders stars by brightness greater than 17 magnitudes. She initially analyzed 299 plates from 13 telescopes to construct her scale, which was accepted by the [International Committee of Photographic Magnitudes](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=International_Committee_of_Photographic_Magnitudes&action=edit&redlink=1 "International Committee of Photographic Magnitudes (page does not exist)") in 1913.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Leavitt#cite_note-22)

In 1913, Leavitt discovered [T Pyxidis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_Pyxidis "T Pyxidis"), a [recurrent nova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova#Recurrent_novae "Nova") in the constellation [Pyxis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyxis "Pyxis"), and one of the most frequent recurrent novae in the sky, with eruptions observed in 1890, 1902, 1920, 1944, 1967, and 2011.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Leavitt#cite_note-23)

Leavitt was a member of [Phi Beta Kappa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phi_Beta_Kappa "Phi Beta Kappa"), the [American Association of University Women](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Association_of_University_Women "American Association of University Women"), the [American Astronomical and Astrophysical Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Astronomical_Society "American Astronomical Society"), the [American Association for the Advancement of Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Science "American Association for the Advancement of Science"), and an honorary member of the [American Association of Variable Star Observers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Association_of_Variable_Star_Observers "American Association of Variable Star Observers"). In 1921, when [Harlow Shapley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlow_Shapley "Harlow Shapley") took over as director of the observatory, Leavitt was made head of stellar [photometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photometry_(astronomy) "Photometry (astronomy)"). By the end of that year she had died from cancer.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Leavitt#cite_note-Johnson-6): 89

[![Image 7: A picture of Leavitt in 1921](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/97/Henrietta_Swan_Leavitt_1921.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Henrietta_Swan_Leavitt_1921.png)

Leavitt making measurements in 1921

According to science writer [Jeremy Bernstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Bernstein "Jeremy Bernstein"), "variable stars had been of interest for years, but when she was studying those plates, I doubt Pickering thought she would make a significant discovery—one that would eventually change astronomy."[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Leavitt#cite_note-24) The period–luminosity relationship for Cepheids, now known as "Leavitt's law", made the stars the first "[standard candle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_candle "Standard candle")" in astronomy, allowing scientists to compute the [distances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_distance_ladder "Cosmic distance ladder") to stars too remote for [stellar parallax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_parallax "Stellar parallax") observations to be useful. One year after Leavitt reported her results, [Ejnar Hertzsprung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejnar_Hertzsprung "Ejnar Hertzsprung") determined the distance of several Cepheids in the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way "Milky Way"); with this calibration, the distance to any Cepheid could be determined accurately.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Leavitt#cite_note-PLhistory-9)

Cepheids were soon detected in other galaxies, such as [Andromeda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy "Andromeda Galaxy") (notably by Edwin Hubble in 1923–24), and they became an important part of the evidence that "[spiral nebulae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_galaxy "Spiral galaxy")" are independent galaxies located far outside of the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way "Milky Way"). Thus, Leavitt's discovery would forever change humanity's picture of the universe, as it prompted [Harlow Shapley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlow_Shapley "Harlow Shapley") to move the Sun from the center of the galaxy in the "[Great Debate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Debate_(astronomy) "Great Debate (astronomy)")" and [Edwin Hubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble "Edwin Hubble") to move the Milky Way galaxy from the center of the universe.

Leavitt's discovery of an accurate way to measure distances on an inter-galactic scale, paved the way for modern astronomy's understanding of the structure and scale of the universe.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Leavitt#cite_note-carnegiescience-4) The accomplishments of [Edwin Hubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble "Edwin Hubble"), the American astronomer who established that the universe is expanding, also were made possible by Leavitt's groundbreaking research.

Hubble often said that Leavitt deserved the Nobel Prize for her work.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Leavitt#cite_note-25) Mathematician [Gösta Mittag-Leffler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6sta_Mittag-Leffler "Gösta Mittag-Leffler"), a member of the [Swedish Academy of Sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_Academy_of_Sciences "Swedish Academy of Sciences"), tried to nominate her for that prize in 1925, only to learn that she had died of cancer three years earlier.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Leavitt#cite_note-Singh-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Leavitt#cite_note-Johnson-6): 118  (The Nobel Prize is not awarded posthumously.)

Cepheid variables allow astronomers to measure distances up to about 60 million light years. Even greater distances can now be measured by using the theoretical maximum mass of [white dwarfs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_dwarf "White dwarf") calculated by [Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subrahmanyan_Chandrasekhar "Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar").[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Leavitt#cite_note-26)[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Leavitt#cite_note-27)

The Leavitt family monument in Cambridge Cemetery

Leavitt's scientific work at Harvard was frequently interrupted by illness and family obligations. Her early death at the age of 53, from stomach cancer,[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Leavitt#cite_note-28) was seen as a tragedy by her colleagues for reasons that went beyond her scientific achievements. Her colleague [Solon I. Bailey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solon_I._Bailey "Solon I. Bailey") wrote in his obituary for Leavitt that "she had the happy, joyful, faculty of appreciating all that was worthy and lovable in others, and was possessed of a nature so full of sunshine that, to her, all of life became beautiful and full of meaning."[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Leavitt#cite_note-Johnson-6): 28

She was buried in the Leavitt family plot at [Cambridge Cemetery](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cambridge_Cemetery&action=edit&redlink=1 "Cambridge Cemetery (page does not exist)") in [Cambridge, Massachusetts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge,_Massachusetts "Cambridge, Massachusetts")."Sitting at the top of a gentle hill", writes George Johnson in his biography of Leavitt, "the spot is marked by a tall hexagonal monument, on top of which sits a globe cradled on a draped marble pedestal. Her uncle [Erasmus Darwin Leavitt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasmus_Darwin_Leavitt,_Jr. "Erasmus Darwin Leavitt, Jr.") and his family also are buried there, along with other Leavitts." A plaque memorializing Henrietta and her two siblings, Mira and Roswell, is mounted on one side of the monument. Nearby are the graves of [Henry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_James "Henry James") and [William James](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_James "William James").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Leavitt#cite_note-Johnson-6): 90
