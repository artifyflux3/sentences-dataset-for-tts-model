Electron transfer from a neutral [lithium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium "Lithium") (Li) atom on the left to a neutral [fluorine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorine "Fluorine") (F) atom on the right would give a [Li+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_ion "Lithium ion") and [F−](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoride_ion "Fluoride ion") ions.

An **ion** ()[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion#cite_note-1) is an [atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom "Atom") or [molecule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule "Molecule") with a net [electrical charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_charge "Electrical charge"). The charge of an [electron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron "Electron") is considered to be negative by convention and this charge is equal and opposite to the charge of a [proton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton "Proton"), which is considered to be positive by convention. The net charge of an ion is not zero because its total number of electrons is unequal to its total number of protons.

A **cation** is a positively charged ion with fewer electrons than protons[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion#cite_note-2) (e.g. K+ ([potassium ion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium_ion "Potassium ion"))) while an **anion** is a negatively charged ion with more electrons than protons[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion#cite_note-3) (e.g. Cl− ([chloride ion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloride_ion "Chloride ion")) and OH− ([hydroxide ion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxide_ion "Hydroxide ion"))). Opposite electric charges are pulled towards one another by [electrostatic force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrostatic_force "Electrostatic force"), so cations and anions attract each other and readily form [ionic compounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionic_compound "Ionic compound"). Ions consisting of only a single atom are termed _monatomic ions_, _atomic ions_ or _simple ions_, while ions consisting of two or more atoms are termed [polyatomic ions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyatomic_ion "Polyatomic ion") or _molecular ions_.

If only a + or − is present, it indicates a +1 or −1 charge, as seen in Na+ ([sodium ion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_ion "Sodium ion")) and F−

 ([fluoride ion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoride_ion "Fluoride ion")). To indicate a more severe charge, the number of additional or missing electrons is supplied, as seen in O 2−

2 ([peroxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peroxide "Peroxide"), negatively charged, polyatomic) and He 2+ ([alpha particle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_particle "Alpha particle"), positively charged, monatomic).[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion#cite_note-ThoughtCo-4)

In the case of physical ionization in a fluid (gas or liquid), "ion pairs" are created by spontaneous molecule collisions, where each generated pair consists of a free electron and a positive ion.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion#cite_note-Knoll-1999-5) Ions are also created by chemical interactions, such as the [dissolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissolution_(chemistry) "Dissolution (chemistry)") of a [salt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(chemistry) "Salt (chemistry)") in liquids, or by other means, such as passing a [direct current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_current "Direct current") through a conducting solution, dissolving an [anode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anode "Anode") via [ionization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionization "Ionization").

History of discovery
--------------------

The word _ion_ was coined from neuter present participle of Greek ἰέναι (_ienai_), meaning "to go". A cation is something that moves down ([Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language "Greek language"): κάτω, _kato_, meaning "down") and an anion is something that moves up ([Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language "Greek language"): ἄνω, _ano_, meaning "up"). They are so called because ions move toward the electrode of opposite charge. This term was introduced (after a suggestion by the English [polymath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath "Polymath")[William Whewell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Whewell "William Whewell"))[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion#cite_note-Frank_A-1991-6) by English physicist and chemist [Michael Faraday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Faraday "Michael Faraday") in 1834 for the then-unknown species that _goes_ from one [electrode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrode "Electrode") to the other through an aqueous medium.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion#cite_note-7)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion#cite_note-8) Faraday did not know the nature of these species, but he knew that since metals dissolved into and entered a solution at one electrode and new metal came forth from a solution at the other electrode; that some kind of substance has moved through the solution in a current. This conveys matter from one place to the other. In correspondence with Faraday, Whewell also coined the words _[anode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anode "Anode")_ and _[cathode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode "Cathode")_, as well as _anion_ and _cation_ as ions that are attracted to the respective electrodes.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion#cite_note-Frank_A-1991-6)

[Svante Arrhenius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svante_Arrhenius "Svante Arrhenius") put forth, in his 1884 dissertation, the explanation of the fact that solid crystalline salts [dissociate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociate "Dissociate") into paired charged particles when dissolved, for which he would win the 1903 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion#cite_note-9) Arrhenius' explanation was that in forming a solution, the salt dissociates into Faraday's ions, he proposed that ions formed even in the absence of an electric current.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion#cite_note-Columbia_University-1976-10)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion#cite_note-EncBrit-11)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion#cite_note-SciBio-12)

Characteristics
---------------

Ions in their gas-like state are highly reactive and will rapidly interact with ions of opposite charge to give neutral molecules or ionic salts. Ions are also produced in the liquid or solid state when salts interact with solvents (for example, water) to produce _solvated ions_, which are more stable, for reasons involving a combination of [energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy "Energy") and [entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy "Entropy") changes as the ions move away from each other to interact with the liquid. These stabilized species are more commonly found in the environment at low temperatures. A common example is the ions present in seawater, which are derived from dissolved salts.

As charged objects, ions are attracted to opposite electric charges (positive to negative, and vice versa) and repelled by like charges. When they move, their trajectories can be deflected by a [magnetic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field "Magnetic field").

Electrons, due to their smaller mass and thus larger space-filling properties as [matter waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter_waves "Matter waves"), determine the size of atoms and molecules that possess any electrons at all. Thus, anions (negatively charged ions) are larger than the parent molecule or atom, as the excess electron(s) repel each other and add to the physical size of the ion, because its size is determined by its [electron cloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_cloud "Electron cloud"). Cations are smaller than the corresponding parent atom or molecule due to the smaller size of the electron cloud. One particular cation (that of hydrogen) contains no electrons, and thus consists of a single proton – _much smaller_ than the parent hydrogen atom.

### Anions and cations

"Anion" redirects here. Not to be confused with the quasiparticle [Anyon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anyon "Anyon").

[![Image 2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/Ions.svg/500px-Ions.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ions.svg)

[Hydrogen atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_atom "Hydrogen atom") (center) contains a single [proton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton "Proton") and a single [electron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron "Electron"). Removal of the electron gives a cation (left), whereas the addition of an electron gives an anion (right). The [hydrogen anion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_anion "Hydrogen anion"), with its loosely held two-electron cloud, has a larger radius than the neutral atom, which in turn is much larger than the bare proton of the cation. Hydrogen forms the only charge-+1 cation that has no electrons, but even cations that (unlike hydrogen) retain one or more electrons are still smaller than the neutral atoms or molecules from which they are derived.

Anion (−) and cation (+) indicate the net electric charge on an ion. An ion that has more electrons than protons, giving it a net negative charge, is named an anion, and a minus indication "Anion (−)" indicates the negative charge. With a cation it is just the opposite: it has fewer electrons than protons, giving it a net positive charge, hence the indication "Cation (+)".

Since the electric charge on a proton is equal in magnitude to the charge on an electron, the net electric charge on an ion is equal to the number of protons in the ion minus the number of electrons.

An anion (−) ( [_ANN-eye-ən_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Pronunciation_respelling_key "Help:Pronunciation respelling key"), from the Greek word ἄνω (_ánō_), meaning "up"[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion#cite_note-13)) is an ion with more electrons than protons, giving it a net negative charge (since electrons are negatively charged and protons are positively charged).[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion#cite_note-14)

A cation (+) ( [_KAT-eye-ən_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Pronunciation_respelling_key "Help:Pronunciation respelling key"), from the Greek word κάτω (_kátō_), meaning "down"[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion#cite_note-15)) is an ion with fewer electrons than protons, giving it a positive charge.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion#cite_note-16)

There are additional names used for ions with multiple charges. For example, an ion with a −2 charge is known as a [dianion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dianion "Dianion") and an ion with a +2 charge is known as a [dication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dication "Dication"). A [zwitterion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zwitterion "Zwitterion") is a neutral molecule with positive and negative charges at different locations within that molecule.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion#cite_note-17)

Cations and anions are measured by their [ionic radius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionic_radius "Ionic radius") and they differ in relative size: "Cations are small, most of them less than 10−10 m (10−8 cm) in radius. But most anions are large, as is the most common Earth anion, [oxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen "Oxygen"). From this fact it is apparent that most of the space of a [crystal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal "Crystal") is occupied by the anion and that the cations fit into the spaces between them."[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion#cite_note-Press1986-18)

The terms _anion_ and _cation_ (for ions that respectively travel to the anode and cathode during electrolysis) were [introduced by Michael Faraday in 1834](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion#History_of_discovery) following his consultation with [William Whewell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Whewell "William Whewell").

### Natural occurrences

Ions are ubiquitous in [nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature "Nature") and are responsible for diverse phenomena from the luminescence of the Sun to the existence of the Earth's [ionosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere "Ionosphere"). Atoms in their ionic state may have a different color from neutral atoms, and thus light absorption by metal ions gives the color of [gemstones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemstone "Gemstone"). In both inorganic and organic chemistry (including biochemistry), the interaction of water and ions is often relevant for understanding properties of systems; an example of their importance is in the breakdown of adenosine triphosphate ([ATP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate "Adenosine triphosphate")), which provides the energy for many reactions in biological systems.

Ions can be non-chemically prepared using various [ion sources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_source "Ion source"), usually involving high [voltage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage "Voltage") or temperature. These are used in a multitude of devices such as [mass spectrometers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometers "Mass spectrometers"), [optical emission spectrometers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_emission_spectrometer "Optical emission spectrometer"), [particle accelerators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_accelerators "Particle accelerators"), [ion implanters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_implantation "Ion implantation"), and [ion engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_engines "Ion engines").

As reactive charged particles, they are also used in [air purification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_ioniser "Air ioniser") by disrupting microbes, and in household items such as [smoke detectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke_detector "Smoke detector").

As signalling and metabolism in organisms are controlled by a precise ionic gradient across [membranes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane "Cell membrane"), the disruption of this gradient contributes to cell death. This is a common mechanism exploited by natural and artificial [biocides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biocides "Biocides"), including the [ion channels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channels "Ion channels")[gramicidin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramicidin "Gramicidin") and [amphotericin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphotericin "Amphotericin") (a [fungicide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungicide "Fungicide")).

Inorganic dissolved ions are a component of [total dissolved solids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_dissolved_solids "Total dissolved solids"), a widely known indicator of [water quality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_quality "Water quality").

### Detection of ionizing radiation

[![Image 3](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Ion_chamber_operation.gif/330px-Ion_chamber_operation.gif)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ion_chamber_operation.gif)

Schematic of an ion chamber, showing drift of ions. Electrons drift faster than positive ions due to their much smaller mass.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion#cite_note-Knoll-1999-5)

[![Image 4](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/Electron_avalanche.gif/330px-Electron_avalanche.gif)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Electron_avalanche.gif)

Avalanche effect between two electrodes. The original ionization event liberates one electron, and each subsequent collision liberates a further electron, so two electrons emerge from each collision: the ionizing electron and the liberated electron.

The ionizing effect of radiation on a gas is extensively used for the detection of radiation such as [alpha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_particle "Alpha particle"), [beta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_particle "Beta particle"), [gamma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_ray "Gamma ray"), and [X-rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-rays "X-rays"). The original ionization event in these instruments results in the formation of an "ion pair"; a positive ion and a free electron, by ion impact by the radiation on the gas molecules. The [ionization chamber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionization_chamber "Ionization chamber") is the simplest of these detectors, and collects all the charges created by _direct ionization_ within the gas through the application of an electric field.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion#cite_note-Knoll-1999-5)

The [Geiger–Müller tube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geiger%E2%80%93M%C3%BCller_tube "Geiger–Müller tube") and the [proportional counter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_counter "Proportional counter") both use a phenomenon known as a [Townsend avalanche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Townsend_avalanche "Townsend avalanche") to multiply the effect of the original ionizing event by means of a cascade effect whereby the free electrons are given sufficient energy by the electric field to release further electrons by ion impact.

### Denoting the charged state

[![Image 5](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Ions_notation.svg/250px-Ions_notation.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ions_notation.svg)

Equivalent notations for an [iron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron "Iron") atom (Fe) that lost two electrons, referred to as [ferrous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrous "Ferrous").

When writing the [chemical formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_formula "Chemical formula") for an ion, its net charge is written in superscript immediately after the chemical structure for the molecule/atom. The net charge is written with the magnitude _before_ the sign; that is, a doubly charged cation is indicated as **2+** instead of **+2**. However, the magnitude of the charge is omitted for singly charged molecules/atoms; for example, the [sodium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium "Sodium") cation is indicated as Na+ and _not_ Na 1+.

An alternative (and acceptable) way of showing a molecule/atom with multiple charges is by drawing out the signs multiple times, this is often seen with transition metals. Chemists sometimes circle the sign; this is merely ornamental and does not alter the chemical meaning. All three representations of Fe 2+, Fe++, and Fe⊕⊕ shown in the figure, are thus equivalent.

[![Image 6](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/Ions_notation2.svg/250px-Ions_notation2.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ions_notation2.svg)

Mixed Roman numerals and charge notations for the [uranyl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranyl "Uranyl") ion. The oxidation state of the metal is shown as superscripted Roman numerals, whereas the charge of the entire complex is shown by the angle symbol together with the magnitude and sign of the net charge.

Monatomic ions are sometimes also denoted with [Roman numerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals "Roman numerals"), particularly in [spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopic_notation#Ionization_states "Spectroscopic notation"); for example, the Fe 2+ (positively doubly charged) example seen above is referred to as Fe(III), Fe III or Fe III (Fe I for a neutral Fe atom, Fe II for a singly ionized Fe ion). The Roman numeral designates the _formal [oxidation state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidation\_state "Oxidation state")_ of an element, whereas the superscripted Indo-Arabic numerals denote the net charge. The two notations are, therefore, exchangeable for monatomic ions, but the Roman numerals _cannot_ be applied to polyatomic ions. However, it is possible to mix the notations for the individual metal centre with a polyatomic complex, as shown by the uranyl ion example.

### Sub-classes

If an ion contains [unpaired electrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unpaired_electron "Unpaired electron"), it is called a _[radical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical\_(chemistry) "Radical (chemistry)")_ ion. Just like uncharged radicals, radical ions are very reactive. Polyatomic ions containing oxygen, such as carbonate and sulfate, are called _[oxyanions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxyanion "Oxyanion")_. Molecular ions that contain at least one carbon to hydrogen bond are called _organic ions_. If the charge in an organic ion is formally centred on a carbon, it is termed a _[carbocation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbocation "Carbocation")_ (if positively charged) or _[carbanion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbanion "Carbanion")_ (if negatively charged).

### Formation

#### Formation of monatomic ions

Monatomic ions are formed by the gain or loss of electrons to the [valence shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valence_electron "Valence electron") (the outer-most electron shell) in an atom. The inner shells of an atom are filled with electrons that are tightly bound to the positively charged [atomic nucleus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_nucleus "Atomic nucleus"), and so do not participate in this kind of chemical interaction. The process of gaining or losing electrons from a neutral atom or molecule is called _ionization_.

Atoms can be ionized by bombardment with [radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation "Radiation"), but the more usual process of ionization encountered in [chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry "Chemistry") is the transfer of electrons between atoms or molecules. This transfer is usually driven by the attaining of stable ("closed shell") [electronic configurations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_configuration "Electronic configuration"). Atoms will gain or lose electrons depending on which action takes the least energy.

For example, a [sodium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium "Sodium") atom, Na, has a single electron in its valence shell, surrounding 2 stable, filled inner shells of 2 and 8 electrons. Since these filled shells are very stable, a sodium atom tends to lose its extra electron and attain this stable configuration, becoming a sodium cation in the process

![Image 7: {\displaystyle {\mathrm {Na} {}\mathrel {\longrightarrow } {}\mathrm {Na} {\vphantom {A}}^{+}{}+{}\mathrm {e} {\vphantom {A}}^{-}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/17906601ff98d6a97a13fd68a9891427ee46c02f)
On the other hand, a [chlorine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorine "Chlorine") atom, Cl, has 7 electrons in its valence shell, which is one short of the stable, filled shell with 8 electrons. Thus, a chlorine atom tends to _gain_ an extra electron and attain a stable 8-[electron configuration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_configuration "Electron configuration"), becoming a chloride anion in the process:

![Image 8: {\displaystyle {\mathrm {Cl} {}+{}\mathrm {e} {\vphantom {A}}^{-}{}\mathrel {\longrightarrow } {}\mathrm {Cl} {\vphantom {A}}^{-}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2fc02c2de669b9966e69e0236c546e78c13108b2)
This driving force is what causes sodium and chlorine to undergo a chemical reaction, wherein the "extra" electron is transferred from sodium to chlorine, forming sodium cations and chloride anions. Being oppositely charged, these cations and anions form [ionic bonds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionic_bond "Ionic bond") and combine to form [sodium chloride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_chloride "Sodium chloride"), NaCl, more commonly known as table salt.

![Image 9: {\displaystyle {\mathrm {Na} {\vphantom {A}}^{+}{}+{}\mathrm {Cl} {\vphantom {A}}^{-}{}\mathrel {\longrightarrow } {}\mathrm {NaCl} }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/12d568d35dbae0294b525a669ceed258d7840320)
#### Formation of polyatomic ions

[![Image 10](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Nitrate-ion-elpot.png/250px-Nitrate-ion-elpot.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Nitrate-ion-elpot.png)

An [electrostatic potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_potential "Electric potential") map of the [nitrate ion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrate_ion "Nitrate ion") (2NO−3). The 3-dimensional shell represents a single arbitrary [isopotential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isopotential "Isopotential").

Polyatomic and molecular ions are often formed by the gaining or losing of elemental ions such as a proton, H+, in neutral molecules. For example, when [ammonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonia "Ammonia"), NH 3, accepts a proton, H+—a process called [protonation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protonation "Protonation")—it forms the [ammonium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonium "Ammonium") ion, NH+4. Ammonia and ammonium have the same number of electrons in essentially the same [electronic configuration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_configuration "Electronic configuration"), but ammonium has an extra proton that gives it a net positive charge.

Ammonia can also lose an electron to gain a positive charge, forming the ion NH+3. However, this ion is unstable, because it has an incomplete [valence shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valence_electron "Valence electron") around the nitrogen atom, making it a very reactive [radical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry) "Radical (chemistry)") ion.

Due to the instability of radical ions, polyatomic and molecular ions are usually formed by gaining or losing elemental ions such as H+, rather than gaining or losing electrons. This allows the molecule to preserve its stable electronic configuration while acquiring an electrical charge.

#### Ionization potential

The [energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy "Energy") required to detach an electron in its lowest energy state from an atom or molecule of a gas with less net electric charge is called the _ionization potential_, or _ionization energy_. The _n_ th ionization energy of an atom is the energy required to detach its _n_ th electron after the first _n_ − 1 electrons have already been detached.

Each successive ionization energy is markedly greater than the last. Particularly great increases occur after any given block of [atomic orbitals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_orbital "Atomic orbital") is exhausted of electrons. For this reason, ions tend to form in ways that leave them with full orbital blocks. For example, sodium has one _[valence electron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valence\_electron "Valence electron")_ in its outermost shell, so in ionized form it is commonly found with one lost electron, as Na+. On the other side of the periodic table, chlorine has seven valence electrons, so in ionized form it is commonly found with one gained electron, as Cl−. Caesium has the lowest measured ionization energy of all the elements and helium has the greatest.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion#cite_note-lenntech.com-19) In general, the ionization energy of [metals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metals "Metals") is much lower than the ionization energy of [nonmetals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonmetals "Nonmetals"), which is why, in general, metals will lose electrons to form positively charged ions and nonmetals will gain electrons to form negatively charged ions.

### Ionic bonding

_Ionic bonding_ is a kind of [chemical bonding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_bond "Chemical bond") that arises from the mutual attraction of oppositely charged ions. Ions of like charge repel each other, and ions of opposite charge attract each other. Therefore, ions do not usually exist on their own, but will bind with ions of opposite charge to form a [crystal lattice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_lattice "Crystal lattice"). The resulting compound is called an _ionic compound_, and is said to be held together by _ionic bonding_. In ionic compounds there arise characteristic distances between ion neighbours from which the spatial extension and the [ionic radius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionic_radius "Ionic radius") of individual ions may be derived.

The most common type of ionic bonding is seen in compounds of metals and nonmetals (except [noble gases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_gas "Noble gas"), which rarely form chemical compounds). Metals are characterized by having a small number of electrons in excess of a stable, closed-shell [electronic configuration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_configuration "Electronic configuration"). As such, they have the tendency to lose these extra electrons in order to attain a stable configuration. This property is known as _[electropositivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electropositivity "Electropositivity")_. Non-metals, on the other hand, are characterized by having an [electron configuration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_configuration "Electron configuration") just a few electrons short of a stable configuration. As such, they have the tendency to gain more electrons in order to achieve a stable configuration. This tendency is known as _[electronegativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronegativity "Electronegativity")_. When a highly electropositive metal is combined with a highly electronegative nonmetal, the extra electrons from the metal atoms are transferred to the electron-deficient nonmetal atoms. This reaction produces metal cations and nonmetal anions, which are attracted to each other to form a _[salt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt\_(chemistry) "Salt (chemistry)")_.
