[ 3 ] Background and rationale [ edit ] Edzard Ernst writes that breathwork (or 'rebirthing') is a form of alternative medicine first devised by Leonard Orr in the 1970s.

[ 4 ] [ inconsistent ] Breathwork is the use of breathing techniques to achieve altered states of consciousness and to have a variety of effects on physical and mental well-being.

[ 3 ] Breathwork has been seen as derived from multiple spiritual and pre-scientific traditions from around the world.

[ 3 ] According to Jack Raso, breathwork is described by proponents as a multiform "healing modality" characterized by stylized breathing. Its purported design is to effect physical, emotional, and spiritual change. Such a process can allegedly "dissolve limiting programs" that are "stored" in the mind and body, and increases one's ability to handle more "energy".

[ 5 ] Breathwork practitioners believe that an individual's particular pattern of passive breathing can lead to insights about their unconscious mind.

[ 3 ] Practice [ edit ] During a breathwork session, individuals will typically lie down and be instructed to breathe using particular methods, depending on the sub-type of breathwork.

[ 6 ] Most breathwork sessions last around an hour.

[ 6 ] Alternatively, breathwork is advocated to be done by individuals alone, for shorter periods.

[ 7 ] Sub-types [ edit ] Holotropic Breathwork [ edit ] A practice that uses rapid breathing and other elements such as music to put individuals in altered states of consciousness. It was developed by Stanislav Grof as a successor to his LSD -based psychedelic therapy , following the suppression of legal LSD use in the late 1960s.

[ 8 ] Side effects of the hyperventilation aspect of holotropic breathwork can include cramping in the hands and around the mouth.

[ 3 ] As the expressed goal of holotropic breathwork is to attain an altered state, it should not be attempted alone.

[ 3 ] Following a 1993 report commissioned by the Scottish Charities Office , concerns about the risk that the hyperventilation technique could cause seizure or lead to psychosis in vulnerable people caused the Findhorn Foundation to suspend its breathwork programme.

[ 9 ] Rebirthing [ edit ] A process described as releasing suppressed traumatic childhood memories, especially those related to one's own birth.

[ 10 ] Orr proposed that correct breathing can cure disease and relieve pain.

[ 11 ] Orr devised rebirthing therapy in the 1970s after he supposedly re-lived his own birth while in the bath.

[ 10 ] He believed that breathing techniques could be used to purge traumatic childhood memories that had been repressed.

[ 10 ] [ 12 ] There is no evidence that individuals can remember their births.

[ 13 ] Memories of one's birth that appear to resurface during a rebirthing-breathwork practice are believed to be the result of false memories .

[ 14 ] Rebirthing-breathwork is one of the practices critiqued by anti-cult experts Margaret Singer and Janja Lalich in the book Crazy Therapies: What Are They? Do They Work?

[ 11 ] Singer and Lalich write that proponents of such "bizarre" practices are proud of their non-scientific approach, and that this finds favor with an irrational clientele.

[ 11 ] In 2006, a panel that consisted of over one hundred experts participated in a survey of psychological treatments; they considered rebirthing therapy to be discredited.

[ 15 ] Sitters [ edit ] In addition to a practitioner, breathwork sessions will often have "sitters" present. Sitters are individuals who provide emotional or physical support to those practicing breathwork.

[ 3 ] Side effects [ edit ] Some common side effects include "sleepiness; tingling in the hands, feet, or face; and a sense of altered consciousness that can be distressing to some." [ 6 ] Breathwork is generally considered safe when done with a skilled practitioner, but there are contraindications such as cardiovascular disease , glaucoma , high blood pressure , mental illness , severe asthma , or seizure disorders , among others.

[ 3 ] [ 6 ] Efficacy [ edit ] Limited research data [ edit ] A 2018 review found that research to date had been limited, and that studies showed "limited evidence of a relationship between physiological parameters and psychological/behavioral outcomes in healthy subjects undergoing slow breathing techniques." [ 16 ] A 2023 review said that results showed that breathwork may be effective for improving stress and mental health, but urged caution until more research has been done.

[ 17 ] Possible areas of efficacy [ edit ] Breathwork may be helpful for relaxation and stress in a similar way to meditation .

[ 6 ] [ 18 ] Anxiety may be helped by breathwork.
