The extinction of the light is caused by interstellar dust grains in the coldest, densest parts of molecular clouds. Clusters and large complexes of dark nebulae are associated with Giant Molecular Clouds. Isolated small dark nebulae are called Bok globules . Like other interstellar dust or material, the things it obscures are visible only using radio waves in radio astronomy or infrared in infrared astronomy .

Dark clouds appear so because of sub-micrometre-sized dust particles, coated with frozen carbon monoxide and nitrogen, which effectively block the passage of light at visible wavelengths. Also present are molecular hydrogen, atomic helium, C 18 O (CO with oxygen as the 18 O isotope ), CS, NH 3 ( ammonia ), H 2 CO ( formaldehyde ), c-C 3 H 2 ( cyclopropenylidene ) and a molecular ion N 2 H + ( diazenylium ), all of which are relatively transparent.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] The form of such dark clouds is very irregular: they have no clearly defined outer boundaries and sometimes take on convoluted serpentine shapes. The closest and largest dark nebulae are visible to the naked eye, since they are the least obscured by stars in between Earth and the nebula, and because they have the largest angular size , appearing as dark patches against the brighter background of the Milky Way like the Coalsack Nebula and the Great Rift . These naked-eye objects are sometimes known as dark cloud constellations and take on a variety of names.

In the inner molecular regions of dark nebulae, events such as the formation of stars and masers take place.

Complexes and constellations [ edit ] Along with molecular clouds, dark nebula make up molecular cloud complexes .
