For the class of psychological disorders, see Phobia .

The English suffixes -phobia , -phobic , -phobe (from Greek φόβος phobos , "fear") occur in technical usage in psychiatry to construct words that describe irrational, abnormal , unwarranted, persistent, or disabling fear as a mental disorder (e.g., agoraphobia ), in chemistry to describe chemical aversions (e.g., hydrophobic ), in biology to describe organisms that dislike certain conditions (e.g., acidophobia ), and in medicine to describe hypersensitivity to a stimulus, usually sensory (e.g., photophobia ). In common usage, they also form words that describe dislike or hatred of a particular thing or subject (e.g., homophobia ). The suffix is antonymic to -phil- .

For more information on the psychiatric side, including how psychiatry groups phobias such as agoraphobia, social phobia, or simple phobia, see phobia . The following lists include words ending in -phobia , and include fears that have acquired names. In some cases, the naming of phobias has become a word game , a notable example being a 1998 humorous article published by BBC News .

[ 1 ] In some cases, a word ending in -phobia may have an antonym with the suffix -phil- , e.g., Germanophobe / Germanophile .

Many -phobia lists circulate on the Internet, with words collected from indiscriminate sources, often copying each other. Also, a number of psychiatric websites exist that at the first glance cover a huge number of phobias, but in fact use a standard text to fit any phobia and reuse it for all unusual phobias by merely changing the name. Sometimes it leads to bizarre results, such as suggestions to cure "prostitute phobia".

[ 2 ] Such practice is known as content spamming and is used to attract search engines .

An article published in 1897 in the American Journal of Psychology noted, "the absurd tendency to give Greek names to objects feared (which, as Arndt says, would give us such terms as klopsophobia – fear of thieves and triakaidekaphobia [ sic ] – fear of the number 13 ...)".

[ 3 ] Psychological conditions This section needs more reliable medical references for verification or relies too heavily on primary sources .

Please review the contents of the section and add the appropriate references if you can. Unsourced or poorly sourced material may be challenged and removed .

Find sources: "List of phobias" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( July 2023 ) Specialists may prefer to avoid the suffix -phobia and use more descriptive terms such as personality disorders , anxiety disorders , and avoidant personality disorder . Terms should strictly have a Greek prefix, although many are irregularly formed with Latin or even English prefixes. Many use inaccurate or imprecise prefixes, such as aerophobia (fear of air) for fear of flying.

Years ago, I had a terrifying nightmare. I was back in Konstanz, my German hometown, walking in a beautiful forest adjacent to the lake. Suddenly, the giant trees surrounding me ripped their roots out of the earth and began to run after me, chasing me all the way out of the forest. I ran and ran, fearing for my life. Later I learned that my dream had its roots in an ancient phobia of trees called dendrophobia, a primordial terror linked to a sense that trees are more alive than we think. For those suffering from dendrophobia, trees have a paradoxical mobility that enables them to use their roots to grab humans or even kill them by willfully dropping their branches on them. Dendrophobia, an officially recognized mental illness that may in extreme cases lead to institutionalization, is linked to trees being recognized not simply as living beings but rather as hostile ones, intent on inflicting harm on humans or even killing them.
