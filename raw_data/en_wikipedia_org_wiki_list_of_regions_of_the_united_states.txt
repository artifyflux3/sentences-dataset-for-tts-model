Many regions are defined in law or regulations by the federal government; others by shared culture and history, and others by economic factors.

Interstate regions [ edit ] Census Bureau-designated regions and divisions [ edit ] U.S. Census Bureau regions and divisions Since 1950, the United States Census Bureau defines four statistical regions, with nine divisions.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] The Census Bureau region definition is "widely used [...] for data collection and analysis", [ 3 ] and is the most commonly used classification system.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] U.S. Census Bureau Regional Divisions Region Division States Northeast New England Connecticut Maine Massachusetts New Hampshire Rhode Island Vermont Mid-Atlantic New Jersey New York Pennsylvania Midwest East North Central Illinois Indiana Michigan Ohio Wisconsin West North Central Iowa Kansas Minnesota Missouri Nebraska North Dakota South Dakota South South Atlantic Delaware District of Columbia Florida Georgia Maryland North Carolina South Carolina Virginia West Virginia East South Central Alabama Kentucky Mississippi Tennessee West South Central Arkansas Louisiana Oklahoma Texas West Mountain Arizona Colorado Idaho Montana Nevada New Mexico Utah Wyoming Pacific Alaska California Hawaii Oregon Washington Puerto Rico and other US territories are not part of any census region or census division.

[ 8 ] Federal Reserve Banks [ edit ] Federal Reserve System districts The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 divided the country into twelve districts with a central Federal Reserve Bank in each district. These twelve Federal Reserve Banks together form a major part of the Federal Reserve System , the central banking system of the United States.

Missouri is the only U.S. state to have two Federal Reserve locations within its borders, but several other states are also divided between more than one district.

Circuit The Federal Circuit is not a regional circuit. Its jurisdiction is nationwide but based on the subject matter.

Agency administrative regions [ edit ] In 1969, the Office of Management and Budget published a list of ten "Standard Federal Regions", [ 10 ] to which federal agencies could be restructured as a means of standardizing government administration nationwide. Despite a finding in 1977 that this restructuring did not reduce administrative costs as initially expected, [ 11 ] and the complete rescinding of the standard region system in 1995, [ 12 ] several agencies continue to follow the system, including the Environmental Protection Agency [ 13 ] and the Department of Housing and Urban Development .
