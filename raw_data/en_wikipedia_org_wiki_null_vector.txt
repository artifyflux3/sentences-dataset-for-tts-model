For the zero element in a vector space, see Zero vector . For null vectors in Minkowski space, see Minkowski space § Causal structure .

A null cone where q ( x , y , z ) = x 2 + y 2 − − z 2 .

{\displaystyle q(x,y,z)=x^{2}+y^{2}-z^{2}.} In mathematics , given a vector space X with an associated quadratic form q , written ( X , q ) , a null vector or isotropic vector is a non-zero element x of X for which q ( x ) = 0 .

In the theory of real bilinear forms , definite quadratic forms and isotropic quadratic forms are distinct. They are distinguished in that only for the latter does there exist a nonzero null vector.

A quadratic space ( X , q ) which has a null vector is called a pseudo-Euclidean space . The term isotropic vector v when q ( v ) = 0 has been used in quadratic spaces, [ 1 ] and anisotropic space for a quadratic space without null vectors.

A pseudo-Euclidean vector space may be decomposed (non-uniquely) into orthogonal subspaces A and B , X = A + B , where q is positive-definite on A and negative-definite on B . The null cone , or isotropic cone , of X consists of the union of balanced spheres: ⋃ ⋃ r ≥ ≥ 0 { x = a + b : q ( a ) = − − q ( b ) = r , a , b ∈ ∈ B } .

{\displaystyle \bigcup _{r\geq 0}\{x=a+b:q(a)=-q(b)=r,\ \ a,b\in B\}.} The null cone is also the union of the isotropic lines through the origin.

Split algebras [ edit ] A composition algebra with a null vector is a split algebra .

[ 2 ] In a composition algebra ( A , +, ×, *), the quadratic form is q( x ) = x x *. When x is a null vector then there is no multiplicative inverse for x , and since x ≠ 0, A is not a division algebra .

In the Cayley–Dickson construction , the split algebras arise in the series bicomplex numbers , biquaternions , and bioctonions , which uses the complex number field C {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} } as the foundation of this doubling construction due to L. E. Dickson (1919). In particular, these algebras have two imaginary units , which commute so their product, when squared, yields +1: ( h i ) 2 = h 2 i 2 = ( − − 1 ) ( − − 1 ) = + 1.

{\displaystyle (hi)^{2}=h^{2}i^{2}=(-1)(-1)=+1.} Then ( 1 + h i ) ( 1 + h i ) ∗ ∗ = ( 1 + h i ) ( 1 − − h i ) = 1 − − ( h i ) 2 = 0 {\displaystyle (1+hi)(1+hi)^{*}=(1+hi)(1-hi)=1-(hi)^{2}=0} so 1 + hi is a null vector.

The real subalgebras, split complex numbers , split quaternions , and split-octonions , with their null cones representing the light tracking into and out of 0 ∈ A , suggest spacetime topology .

Examples [ edit ] The light-like vectors of Minkowski space are null vectors.

The four linearly independent biquaternions l = 1 + hi , n = 1 + hj , m = 1 + hk , and m ∗ = 1 – hk are null vectors and { l , n , m , m ∗ } can serve as a basis for the subspace used to represent spacetime . Null vectors are also used in the Newman–Penrose formalism approach to spacetime manifolds.

[ 3 ] In the Verma module of a Lie algebra there are null vectors.
