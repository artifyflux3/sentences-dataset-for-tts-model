Analyse des réfractions astronomiques et terrestres , 1799 Christian Kramp's father was his teacher at grammar school in Strasbourg .

[ 1 ] Kramp studied medicine and graduated; however, his interests certainly ranged outside medicine, for in addition to a number of medical publications he published a work on crystallography in 1793. In 1795, France annexed the Rhineland area in which Kramp was carrying out his work and after this he became a teacher at Cologne (this city was French from 1794 to 1815), teaching mathematics, chemistry , and physics . Kramp could read and write in German and French.

[ 1 ] Kramp was appointed professor of mathematics at Strasbourg , the town of his birth, in 1809. He was elected to the geometry section of the French Academy of Sciences in 1817. As Bessel , Legendre and Gauss did, Kramp worked on the generalised factorial function which applied to non- integers . His work on factorials is independent of that of James Stirling and Vandermonde . He was the first to use the notation n !

( Elements d'arithmétique universelle , 1808). In fact, the more general concept of factorial was found at the same time by Arbogast .

I use the very simple notation n ! to designate the product of numbers decreasing from n to unity, i.e.

n ( n − 1)( n − 2) ... 3 . 2 . 1. The constant use in combinatorial analysis, in most of my proofs, that I make of this idea, has made this notation necessary. ... I have given it the name 'faculty'. Arbogast has substituted the name 'factorial' which is clearer and more French. In adopting his idea I congratulate myself on paying homage to the memory of my friend.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] — Christian Kramp, preface to Elements d'arithmétique universelle , pp. V-VI and XI-XII, 1808 Kramp's function , a scaled complex error function , is today better known as the Faddeeva function .
