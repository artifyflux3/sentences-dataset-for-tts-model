: locules ) or loculus ( Latin for 'little place'; pl.

: loculi ) is a small cavity [ 1 ] or compartment within an organ or part of an organism ( animal , plant , or fungus ).

In angiosperms ( flowering plants ), the term locule usually refers to a chamber within an ovary ( gynoecium or carpel ) of the flower and fruits . Depending on the number of locules in the ovary, fruits can be classified as unilocular (uni-locular), bilocular , trilocular , or multilocular . The number of locules present in a gynoecium may be equal to or less than the number of carpels. The locules contain the ovules or seeds .

The term may also refer to chambers within anthers containing pollen .

[ 2 ] In ascomycetous fungi, locules are chambers within the hymenium in which the perithecia develop.
