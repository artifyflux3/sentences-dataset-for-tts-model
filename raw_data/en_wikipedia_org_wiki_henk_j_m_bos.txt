Life and career [ edit ] Hendrik Jan Maarten Bos was born in Enschede on 17 July 1940.

[ 1 ] Bos was a student of Hans Freudenthal and Jerome Ravetz at Utrecht University and in 1973 wrote a thesis "Differentials, higher order differentials, and the derivative in the Leibnizian calculus" for his doctorate.

[ 2 ] Bos worked at Utrecht University for most of his career. In 1985 he became professor of history of mathematics .

Bos took an interest in the tractrix as a mathematical stimulus.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] Bos retired in 2005.

[ 5 ] Since his retirement he was honorary professor of the history of mathematics at the Faculty of Science at the University of Aarhus . He was married to Kirsti Andersen .

At his Valedictory Symposium [ 6 ] when he retired, Henk spoke on fluid concepts in mathematics in a talk titled "Loose Ends". He was awarded the Kenneth O. May Prize for 2005.

[ 7 ] Bos died in Amsterdam on Shrove Monday, 12 February 2024, at the age of 83.

[ 1 ] Selected publications [ edit ] Bos contributed to the study of the mathematical works of the seventeenth-century philosopher René Descartes , including Descartes’ contribution to the development of algebra and geometry .

Joseph Harris wrote for Mathematical Reviews , "The authors trace very carefully the history of the problem, describing various approaches culminating in a modern proof. The paper is fascinating from both a historical and a mathematical point of view, and should serve as the definitive source of information about Poncelet's problem in the future" MR 0917345 here 1993: Lectures in the History of Mathematics , History of Mathematics #7, American Mathematical Society & London Mathematical Society ISBN 0-8218-9001-8 2001: Redefining Geometrical Exactness.
