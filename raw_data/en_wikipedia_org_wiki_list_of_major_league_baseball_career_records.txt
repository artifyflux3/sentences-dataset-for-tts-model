Holding a career record almost guarantees a player eventual entry into the Baseball Hall of Fame because it represents both longevity and consistency over a long period of time.

Batting records (1875–present) [ edit ] Josh Gibson , who played 510 games in the Negro League, holds the record for highest batting average, slugging percentage, and on-base plus slugging in a career.

Barry Bonds holds the career home run and single-season home run records.

Ichiro Suzuki collected 262 hits in 2004, breaking George Sisler 's 84-year-old record for most hits in a season.
