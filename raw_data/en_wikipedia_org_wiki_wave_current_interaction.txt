The interaction implies an exchange of energy, so after the start of the interaction both the waves and the mean flow are affected.

For depth- integrated and phase - averaged flows, the quantity of primary importance for the dynamics of the interaction is the wave radiation stress tensor .

Wave–current interaction is also one of the possible mechanisms for the occurrence of rogue waves , such as in the Agulhas Current . When a wave group encounters an opposing current, the waves in the group may pile up on top of each other which will propagate into a rogue wave.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Classification [ edit ] Peregrine (1976) identifies five major sub-classes within wave–current interaction: interaction of waves with a large-scale current field , with slow – as compared to the wavelength – two-dimensional horizontal variations of the current fields; interaction of waves with small-scale current changes (in contrast with the case above), where the horizontal current varies suddenly, over a length scale comparable with the wavelength; the combined wave–current motion for currents varying (strongly) with depth below the free surface ; interaction of waves with turbulence ; and interaction of ship waves and currents, such as in the ship's wake .
