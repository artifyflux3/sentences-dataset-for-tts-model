Both the composition and abundance of species within an ecosystem can be affected by the dominant species present.

[ 2 ] In most of the world's ecosystems, biologists have repeatedly observed a rank-abundance curve in which ecosystems comprise a handful of incredibly abundant species, but more numerous, rarer species that are few in number.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] Danish botanist Christen C. Raunkiær described this phenomenon as his " law of frequency " in 1918, in which he recognized that in communities with a single species accounting for most of the biomass, species diversity was often lower.

[ 7 ] Understandably, biologists expect to see more profound effects from those species greater in number.

[ 8 ] First formalized as the mass ratio hypothesis in a 1998 paper by English ecologist J. Philip Grime , ecologically dominant species are predicted to have overwhelming effects on ecosystem function and ecological processes due to their relatively high biomass and ubiquity.

[ 9 ] Androgopon scoparium and Andropogon gerardii dominate this tallgrass prairie in Delorme, Minnesota Most ecological communities are defined by their dominant species.

[ 10 ] [ 2 ] In many examples of wet woodland in western Europe , the dominant tree is alder ( Alnus glutinosa ).

[ 11 ] In tallgrass prairies of Northeastern Kansas , the dominant grass is ( Andropogon gerardii ).

[ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] In temperate bogs , the dominant vegetation is usually species of Sphagnum moss.

[ 16 ] Tidal swamps in the tropics are usually dominated by species of mangrove ( Rhizophoraceae ).

[ 17 ] [ 18 ] Some Arctic sea floor communities are dominated by brittle stars .

[ 19 ] Exposed rocky shorelines are dominated by sessile organisms such as barnacles and limpets .

[ 20 ] The turtle ant ( Cephalotes pusillus ), is thought to dominant arboreal ant communities in the Brazilian savannah .

[ 21 ] There are currently several different metrics for assessing species dominance in natural ecosystems, including the importance value index , [ 22 ] competitive index , [ 23 ] community importance index , [ 24 ] and dominance index .
