[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Cycloidal marks are typically an indication that a tornado possessed suction vortices. Notable tornadoes that have produced cycloidal marks include the 2008 Parkersburg–New Hartford tornado , [ 3 ] 2016 Dodge City tornadoes and the 2022 Nullarbor Plain tornado.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] Cycloidal marks created by dust devils have been documented on Mars by the Mars Global Surveyor .
