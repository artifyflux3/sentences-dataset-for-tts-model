**Claudius Ptolemy** (; [Ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_language "Ancient Greek language"): [Πτολεμαῖος](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%A0%CF%84%CE%BF%CE%BB%CE%B5%CE%BC%CE%B1%E1%BF%96%CE%BF%CF%82 "wikt:Πτολεμαῖος"), _Ptolemaios_; [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_language "Latin language"): _Claudius Ptolemaeus_; c. 100 – 160s/170s AD),[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-Britannica-482098-2) better known [mononymously](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mononym "Mononym") as **Ptolemy**, was a [Greco-Roman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greco-Roman "Greco-Roman")[mathematician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematician "Mathematician"), [astronomer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomer "Astronomer"), [astrologer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrologer "Astrologer"), [geographer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographer "Geographer"), and [music theorist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_theorist "Music theorist")[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-3) who wrote about a dozen scientific [treatises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatise "Treatise"), three of which were important to later [Byzantine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_science "Byzantine science"), [Islamic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_science "Islamic science"), and [Western European](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_in_the_Renaissance "Science in the Renaissance") science. The first was his astronomical treatise now known as the _[Almagest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almagest "Almagest")_, originally entitled _\_Mathēmatikḗ Syntaxis\__ (Μαθηματικὴ Σύνταξις, _\_Mathēmatikḗ Syntaxis\__, lit.'Mathematical Treatise'). The second is the _[Geography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography\_(Ptolemy) "Geography (Ptolemy)")_, which is a thorough discussion on maps and the geographic knowledge of the [Greco-Roman world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greco-Roman_world "Greco-Roman world"). The third is the astrological treatise in which he attempted to adapt [horoscopic astrology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horoscopic_astrology "Horoscopic astrology") to the [Aristotelian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotelian_physics "Aristotelian physics")[natural philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_philosophy "Natural philosophy") of his day. This is sometimes known as the _\_Apotelesmatika\__ (Αποτελεσματικά, 'On the Effects') but more commonly known as the _\_[Tetrábiblos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetr%C3%A1biblos "Tetrábiblos")\__ (from the [Koine Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koine_Greek "Koine Greek") meaning 'four books'; [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_language "Latin language"): _Quadripartitum_).

The [Catholic Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church "Catholic Church") promoted his work, which included the only mathematically sound [geocentric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentric "Geocentric") model of the [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System "Solar System"), and unlike most [Greek mathematicians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_mathematicians "Greek mathematicians"), Ptolemy's writings (foremost the _Almagest_) never ceased to be copied or commented upon, both in [late antiquity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_antiquity "Late antiquity") and in the [Middle Ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages "Middle Ages"). However, it is likely that only a few truly mastered the mathematics necessary to understand his works, as evidenced particularly by the many abridged and watered-down introductions to Ptolemy's astronomy that were popular among the Arabs and Byzantines. His work on [epicycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicycle "Epicycle") is now seen as a very complex theoretical model built in order to explain a false tenet based on faith.

Ptolemy's date of birth and birthplace are both unknown. The 14th-century astronomer [Theodore Meliteniotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Meliteniotes "Theodore Meliteniotes") wrote that Ptolemy's birthplace was [Ptolemais Hermiou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemais_Hermiou "Ptolemais Hermiou"), a Greek city in the [Thebaid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thebaid "Thebaid") region of Egypt (now El Mansha, [Sohag Governorate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sohag_Governorate "Sohag Governorate")). This attestation is quite late, however, and there is no evidence to support it.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-citizenship-4)[[b]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-6)

It is known that Ptolemy lived in or around the city of [Alexandria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria "Alexandria"), in the [Roman province of Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt_(Roman_province) "Egypt (Roman province)") under [Roman rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire "Roman Empire").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-7) He had a Latin name, Claudius, which is generally taken to imply he was a [Roman citizen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_citizen "Roman citizen").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-8) He was familiar with Greek philosophers and used Babylonian observations and Babylonian lunar theory. In half of his extant works, Ptolemy addresses a certain Syrus, a figure of whom almost nothing is known but who likely shared some of Ptolemy's astronomical interests.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-9)

Ptolemy died in Alexandria.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-:0-10)(p311) Ptolemy's year of death is not directly recorded by primary sources, and has to be inferred from the scale of his work.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-:1-11) Suggested years of death include c. 165,[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-12)c. 168,[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-:0-10)(p311)c. 170,[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-:1-11) and c. 175.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-13)

### Naming and nationality

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ptolemy&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Naming and nationality")]

[![Image 2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/Ptolemy_urania.jpg/250px-Ptolemy_urania.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ptolemy_urania.jpg)

Engraving of a crowned Ptolemy being guided by [Urania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urania "Urania"), by [Gregor Reisch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregor_Reisch "Gregor Reisch") (1508), from _Margarita Philosophica_ showing an early conflation of the mathematician with the royal house of [Ptolemaic Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemaic_Kingdom "Ptolemaic Kingdom"), with the same last name.

Ptolemy's Greek name _, [Ptolemaeus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy\_(name) "Ptolemy (name)")_ (Πτολεμαῖος, _Ptolemaîos_), is an [ancient Greek personal name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_personal_names "Ancient Greek personal names"). It occurs once in [Greek mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_mythology "Greek mythology") and is of [Homeric form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeric_Greek "Homeric Greek").[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-14) It was common among the [Macedonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedonia_(ancient_kingdom) "Macedonia (ancient kingdom)") upper class at the time of [Alexander the Great](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_the_Great "Alexander the Great") and there were several of this name among Alexander's army, one of whom made himself [pharaoh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharaoh "Pharaoh") in 323 BC: [Ptolemy I Soter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy_I_Soter "Ptolemy I Soter"), the first pharaoh of the [Ptolemaic Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemaic_Kingdom "Ptolemaic Kingdom"). Almost all subsequent pharaohs of Egypt, with a few exceptions, were named [Ptolemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemaic_dynasty "Ptolemaic dynasty") until [Egypt became a Roman province](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Egypt "Roman Egypt") in 30 BC, ending the Macedonian family's rule.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-15)

The name _Claudius_ is a Roman name, belonging to the [_gens_ Claudia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudia_gens "Claudia gens"); the peculiar multipart form of the whole name _Claudius Ptolemaeus_ is a Roman custom, characteristic of Roman citizens. This indicates that Ptolemy would have been a [Roman citizen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_citizenship "Roman citizenship").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-citizenship-4) Gerald Toomer, the translator of Ptolemy's _Almagest_ into English, suggests that citizenship was probably granted to one of Ptolemy's ancestors by either the emperor [Claudius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudius "Claudius") or the emperor [Nero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nero "Nero").[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-16)

The 9th century [Persian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persians "Persians")[astronomer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy_in_the_medieval_Islamic_world "Astronomy in the medieval Islamic world")[Abu Ma'shar al-Balkhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Ma%27shar_al-Balkhi "Abu Ma'shar al-Balkhi") mistakenly presents Ptolemy as a member of [Ptolemaic Egypt's royal lineage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemaic_dynasty "Ptolemaic dynasty"), stating that the descendants of the Alexandrine general and Pharaoh [Ptolemy I Soter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy_I_Soter "Ptolemy I Soter") were wise "and included Ptolemy the Wise, who composed the book of the _Almagest_". Abu Ma'shar recorded a belief that a different member of this royal line "composed the book on astrology and attributed it to Ptolemy". Historical confusion on this point can be inferred from Abu Ma'shar's subsequent remark: "It is sometimes said that the very learned man who wrote the book of astrology also wrote the book of the _Almagest_. The correct answer is not known."[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-17) Not much positive evidence is known on the subject of Ptolemy's ancestry, apart from what can be drawn from the details of his name, although modern scholars have concluded that Abu Ma'shar's account is erroneous.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-Heilen-2010-19) It is no longer doubted that the astronomer who wrote the _[Almagest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almagest "Almagest")_ also wrote the _[Tetrabiblos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrabiblos "Tetrabiblos")_ as its astrological counterpart.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-Robbins-1940-intro-20)(p x) In later [Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic "Arabic") sources, he was often known as "the [Upper Egyptian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Egypt "Upper Egypt")",[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-21)[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-Bernal-1992-22)(p 606) suggesting he may have had origins in southern [Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt "Egypt").[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-Bernal-1992-22)(pp 602, 606)[Arabic astronomers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy_in_medieval_Islam "Astronomy in medieval Islam"), [geographers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography_in_medieval_Islam "Geography in medieval Islam"), and [physicists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics_in_medieval_Islam "Physics in medieval Islam") referred to his name in [Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic "Arabic") as _Baṭlumyus_ ([Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language "Arabic language"): بَطْلُمْيوس).[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-23)

Ptolemy wrote in [Koine Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koine_Greek "Koine Greek"),[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-24) and can be shown to have used [Babylonian astronomical data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_astronomical_diaries "Babylonian astronomical diaries").[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-25)[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-Jones-1991-26)(p 99) He might have been a Roman citizen, but was ethnically either a [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeks_in_Egypt "Greeks in Egypt")[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-Britannica-482098-2)[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-Katz-1998-27)[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-28) or at least a [Hellenized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenization "Hellenization") Egyptian.[[c]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-29)[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-Sarton-30)[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-31)

Astronomical writings
---------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ptolemy&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Astronomical writings")]

Astronomy was the subject to which Ptolemy devoted the most time and effort; about half of all the works that survived deal with astronomical matters, and even others such as the _Geography_ and the _Tetrabiblos_ have significant references to astronomy.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-Jones-2020-32)

### _Mathēmatikē Syntaxis_

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ptolemy&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Mathēmatikē Syntaxis")]

[![Image 3](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Bodleian_Library_Pococke369_roll332_frame38.jpg/330px-Bodleian_Library_Pococke369_roll332_frame38.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bodleian_Library_Pococke369_roll332_frame38.jpg)

Pages from the _[Almagest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almagest "Almagest")_ in Arabic translation showing astronomical tables.

Ptolemy's _[Almagest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almagest "Almagest")_ (originally [Ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_language "Ancient Greek language"): Μαθηματικὴ Σύνταξις, [romanized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Ancient_Greek "Romanization of Ancient Greek"):_Mathēmatikē Syntaxis_, lit.'Mathematical Systematic Treatise') is the only surviving comprehensive ancient treatise on astronomy. Although [Babylonian astronomers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_astronomers "Babylonian astronomers") had developed arithmetical techniques for calculating and predicting astronomical phenomena, these were not based on any underlying model of the heavens; early Greek astronomers, on the other hand, provided qualitative geometrical models to "save the appearances" of celestial phenomena without the ability to make any predictions.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-33)

The earliest person who attempted to merge these two approaches was [Hipparchus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hipparchus "Hipparchus"), who produced [geometric models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_model "Geometric model") that not only reflected the arrangement of the planets and stars but could be used to calculate celestial motions.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-Jones-1991-26) Ptolemy, following Hipparchus, derived each of his geometrical models for the Sun, Moon, and the planets from selected astronomical observations done in the spanning of more than 800 years; however, many astronomers have for centuries suspected that some of his models' parameters were adopted independently of observations.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-34)

Ptolemy presented his astronomical models alongside convenient tables, which could be used to compute the future or past position of the planets.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-35) The _Almagest_ also contains a [star catalogue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_catalogue "Star catalogue"), which is a version of a catalogue created by Hipparchus. Its list of forty-eight [constellations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation "Constellation") is ancestral to the modern system of constellations but, unlike the modern system, they did not cover the whole sky (only what could be seen with the naked eye in the northern hemisphere).[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-36) For over a thousand years, the _Almagest_ was the authoritative text on astronomy across Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-37)

The _Almagest_ was preserved, like many extant Greek scientific works, in Arabic manuscripts; the modern title is thought to be an Arabic corruption of the Greek name _Hē Megistē Syntaxis_ ('The greatest treatise'), as the work was presumably known during [late antiquity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_antiquity "Late antiquity").[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-38) Because of its reputation, it was widely sought and translated twice into Latin [in the 12th century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_translations_of_the_12th_century "Latin translations of the 12th century"), once in Sicily and again in Spain.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-39) Ptolemy's planetary models, like those of the majority of his predecessors, were geocentric and almost universally accepted until the reappearance of [heliocentric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentric "Heliocentric") models during the [Scientific Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_Revolution "Scientific Revolution").

#### Modern reassessment

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ptolemy&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Modern reassessment")]

Under the scrutiny of modern scholarship, and the cross-checking of observations contained in the _Almagest_ against figures produced through backwards extrapolation, various patterns of errors have emerged within the work.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWade1977-40)[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-FOOTNOTELewis1979-41) A prominent miscalculation is Ptolemy's use of measurements that he claimed were taken at noon, but which systematically produce readings now shown to be off by half an hour, as if the observations were taken at 12:30 pm.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWade1977-40)

The overall quality of Ptolemy's observations has been challenged by several modern scientists, but prominently by [Robert R. Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_R._Newton "Robert R. Newton") in his 1977 book _The Crime of Claudius Ptolemy_, which asserted that Ptolemy fabricated many of his observations to fit his theories.[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGoldstein1978-42) Newton accused Ptolemy of systematically inventing data or doctoring the data of earlier astronomers, and labelled him "the most successful fraud in the history of science".[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWade1977-40) One striking error noted by Newton was an autumn equinox said to have been observed by Ptolemy and "measured with the greatest care" at 2pm on 25 September 132, when the equinox should have been observed around 9:55am the day prior.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWade1977-40) In attempting to disprove Newton, Herbert Lewis also found himself agreeing that "Ptolemy was an outrageous fraud,"[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-FOOTNOTELewis1979-41) and that "all those result capable of statistical analysis point beyond question towards fraud and against accidental error".[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-FOOTNOTELewis1979-41)

The charges laid by Newton and others have been the subject of wide discussions and received significant push back from other scholars against the findings.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWade1977-40)[Owen Gingerich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owen_Gingerich "Owen Gingerich"), while agreeing that the _Almagest_ contains "some remarkably fishy numbers",[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWade1977-40) including in the matter of the 30-hour displaced equinox, which he noted aligned perfectly with predictions made by Hipparchus 278 years earlier,[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGingerich1980-43) rejected the qualification of fraud.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWade1977-40) Objections were also raised by [Bernard Goldstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_R._Goldstein "Bernard R. Goldstein"), who questioned Newton's findings and suggested that he had misunderstood the secondary literature, while noting that issues with the accuracy of Ptolemy's observations had long been known.[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGoldstein1978-42) Other authors have pointed out that instrument warping or atmospheric refraction may also explain some of Ptolemy's observations at a wrong time.[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-44)[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-45)

In 2022 the first Greek fragments of Hipparchus' lost star catalog were discovered in a [palimpsest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palimpsest "Palimpsest") and they debunked accusations made by the French astronomer [Jean Baptiste Joseph Delambre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Baptiste_Joseph_Delambre "Jean Baptiste Joseph Delambre") in the early 1800s which were repeated by R. R. Newton. Specifically, it proved Hipparchus was not the sole source of Ptolemy's catalog, as they both had claimed, and proved that Ptolemy did not simply copy Hipparchus' measurements and adjust them to account for precession of the equinoxes, as they had claimed. Scientists analyzing the charts concluded:

> It also confirms that Ptolemy’s Star Catalogue was not based solely on data from Hipparchus’ Catalogue.
> 
> 
> ... These observations are consistent with the view that Ptolemy composed his star catalogue by combining various sources, including Hipparchus’ catalogue, his own observations and, possibly, those of other authors.[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-46)

The _[Handy Tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handy\_Tables "Handy Tables")_ ([Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language "Greek language"): Πρόχειροι κανόνες) are a set of astronomical tables, together with canons for their use. To facilitate astronomical calculations, Ptolemy tabulated all the data needed to compute the positions of the Sun, Moon and planets, the rising and setting of the stars, and [eclipses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipses "Eclipses") of the Sun and Moon, making it a useful tool for astronomers and astrologers. The tables themselves are known through [Theon of Alexandria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theon_of_Alexandria "Theon of Alexandria")'s version. Although Ptolemy's _Handy Tables_ do not survive as such in Arabic or in Latin, they represent the prototype of most Arabic and Latin astronomical tables or _[zījes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zij "Zij")_.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-47)

Additionally, the introduction to the _Handy Tables_ survived separately from the tables themselves (apparently part of a gathering of some of Ptolemy's shorter writings) under the title _Arrangement and Calculation of the Handy Tables_.[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-48)

### _Planetary Hypotheses_

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ptolemy&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Planetary Hypotheses")]

[![Image 4](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/Bartolomeu_Velho_1568.jpg/330px-Bartolomeu_Velho_1568.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bartolomeu_Velho_1568.jpg)

A depiction of the non-Ptolemaic Universe with no epicycles, possibly from 500 years before Ptolemy, as described in the _Planetary Hypotheses_ by [Bartolomeu Velho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartolomeu_Velho "Bartolomeu Velho") (1568).

The _Planetary Hypotheses_ ([Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language "Greek language"): Ὑποθέσεις τῶν πλανωμένων, lit.'Hypotheses of the Planets') is a [cosmological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology "Cosmology") work, probably one of the last written by Ptolemy, in two books dealing with the structure of the universe and the laws that govern [celestial motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_mechanics "Celestial mechanics").[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-49) Ptolemy goes beyond the mathematical models of the _Almagest_ to present a physical realization of the universe as a set of nested spheres,[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-50) in which he used the [epicycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicycle "Epicycle") of his planetary model to compute the dimensions of the universe. He estimated the Sun was at an average distance of 1 210 Earth radii (now known to actually be ~23 450 radii), while the radius of the sphere of the fixed stars was 20 000 times the radius of the Earth.[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-51)

The work is also notable for having descriptions on how to build instruments to depict the planets and their movements from a [geocentric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentrism "Geocentrism") perspective, much as an [orrery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orrery "Orrery") would have done for a [heliocentric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism "Heliocentrism") one, presumably for didactic purposes.[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-52)

### Other astronomical works

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ptolemy&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Other astronomical works")]

The _Analemma_ is a short treatise where Ptolemy provides a method for specifying the location of the Sun in three pairs of locally oriented coordinate arcs as a function of the declination of the Sun, the terrestrial latitude, and the hour. The key to the approach is to represent the solid configuration in a plane diagram that Ptolemy calls the _[analemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analemma "Analemma")_.[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-53)

In another work, the _Phaseis_ (_Risings of the Fixed Stars_), Ptolemy gave a _parapegma_, a star [calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar "Calendar") or [almanac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almanac "Almanac"), based on the appearances and disappearances of stars over the course of the solar year.[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-54)

The _[Planisphaerium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planisphaerium "Planisphaerium")_ ([Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language "Greek language"): Ἅπλωσις ἐπιφανείας σφαίρας, lit.'Flattening of the sphere') contains 16 propositions dealing with the projection of the celestial circles onto a plane. The text is lost in Greek (except for a fragment) and survives in Arabic and Latin only.[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-55)

Ptolemy also erected an inscription in a temple at [Canopus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canopus,_Egypt "Canopus, Egypt"), around 146–147 AD, known as the _Canobic Inscription_. Although the inscription has not survived, someone in the sixth century transcribed it, and manuscript copies preserved it through the Middle Ages. It begins: "To the saviour god, Claudius Ptolemy (dedicates) the first principles and models of astronomy", following by a catalogue of numbers that define a system of celestial mechanics governing the motions of the Sun, Moon, planets, and stars.[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-56)

In 2023, archaeologists were able to read a manuscript which gives instructions for the construction of an astronomical tool called a _[meteoroscope](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Meteoroscope&action=edit&redlink=1 "Meteoroscope (page does not exist)")_ (μετεωροσκόπιον or μετεωροσκοπεῖον). The text, which comes from an eighth-century manuscript which also contains Ptolemy's _Analemma_, was identified on the basis of both its content and linguistic analysis as being by Ptolemy.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-57)[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-58)

Ptolemy is also though to have produced his [Table of Noteworthy Cities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_Noteworthy_Cities_(Ptolemy) "Table of Noteworthy Cities (Ptolemy)") as an aid to his [astronomical tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handy_Tables "Handy Tables").[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-59)

A printed map from the 15th century depicting Ptolemy's description of the _[Ecumene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecumene "Ecumene")_ by Johannes Schnitzer (1482).

Ptolemy's second most well-known work is his _Geographike Hyphegesis_ ([Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language "Greek language"): Γεωγραφικὴ Ὑφήγησις; lit.'Guide to Drawing the Earth'), known as the _[Geography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography\_(Ptolemy) "Geography (Ptolemy)")_, a handbook on how to draw maps using [geographical coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographical_coordinates "Geographical coordinates") for parts of the [Roman world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire "Roman Empire") known at the time.[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-Gra%C3%9Fhf-Mittnhbr-Rinner-2017-60)[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-Isaksen-2011-61) He relied on previous work by an earlier geographer, [Marinus of Tyre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marinos_of_Tyre "Marinos of Tyre"), as well as on [gazetteers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gazetteer "Gazetteer") of the Roman and ancient [Persian Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Iran "History of Iran").[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-Isaksen-2011-61)[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-Gra%C3%9Fhf-Mittnhbr-Rinner-2017-60) He also acknowledged ancient astronomer [Hipparchus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hipparchus "Hipparchus") for having provided the elevation of the [north celestial pole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_pole#Finding_the_north_celestial_pole "Celestial pole")[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-62) for a few cities. Although [maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maps "Maps") based on scientific principles had been made since the time of [Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes "Eratosthenes") (c. 276– c. 195 BC), Ptolemy improved on [map projections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_projection "Map projection").

The first part of the _Geography_ is a discussion of the data and of the methods he used. Ptolemy notes the supremacy of astronomical data over land measurements or travelers' reports, though he possessed these data for only a handful of places. Ptolemy's real innovation, however, occurs in the second part of the book, where he provides a catalogue of 8,000 localities he collected from Marinus and others, the biggest such database from antiquity.[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-Mittnhbr-2010-63) About 6 300 of these places and geographic features have assigned [coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate "Coordinate") so that they can be placed in a [grid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grid_(spatial_index) "Grid (spatial index)") that spanned the globe.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-Jones-2020-32)[Latitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude "Latitude") was measured from the [equator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equator "Equator"), as it is today, but Ptolemy preferred to express it as _[climata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clime "Clime")_, the length of the longest day rather than [degrees of arc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle) "Degree (angle)"): The length of the [midsummer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midsummer "Midsummer") day increases from 12h to 24h as one goes from the equator to the [polar circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_circle "Polar circle").[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-64) One of the places Ptolemy noted specific coordinates for was the now-lost [stone tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Tower_(Ptolemy) "Stone Tower (Ptolemy)") which marked the midpoint on the ancient [Silk Road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road "Silk Road"), and which scholars have been trying to locate ever since.[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-65)

In the third part of the _Geography_, Ptolemy gives instructions on how to create maps both of the whole inhabited world (_[oikoumenē](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oikoumen%C4%93 "Oikoumenē")_) and of the Roman provinces, including the necessary [topographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topographic_map "Topographic map") lists, and captions for the maps. His _oikoumenē_ spanned 180 degrees of longitude from the Blessed Islands in the [Atlantic Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean "Atlantic Ocean") to the middle of [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China "China"), and about 80 degrees of latitude from [Shetland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shetland "Shetland") to anti-Meroe (east coast of [Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa "Africa")); Ptolemy was well aware that he knew about only a quarter of the globe, and an erroneous extension of China southward suggests his sources did not reach all the way to the Pacific Ocean.[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-Gra%C3%9Fhf-Mittnhbr-Rinner-2017-60)[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-Isaksen-2011-61)

It seems likely that the topographical tables in the second part of the work (Books 2–7) are cumulative texts, which were altered as new knowledge became available in the centuries after Ptolemy.[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBagrow1945-66) This means that information contained in different parts of the _Geography_ is likely to be of different dates, in addition to containing many scribal errors. However, although the regional and [world maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy%27s_world_map "Ptolemy's world map") in surviving manuscripts date from c. 1300 AD (after the text was rediscovered by [Maximus Planudes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximus_Planudes "Maximus Planudes")), there are some scholars who think that such maps go back to Ptolemy himself.[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-Mittnhbr-2010-63)

[![Image 7](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Ptolemaeus_-_Quadripartitum%2C_1622_-_4658973.tif/lossy-page1-200px-Ptolemaeus_-_Quadripartitum%2C_1622_-_4658973.tif.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ptolemaeus_-_Quadripartitum,_1622_-_4658973.tif)

A copy of the _Quadripartitum_ (1622)

Ptolemy wrote an astrological treatise, in four parts, known by the Greek term _[Tetrabiblos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrabiblos "Tetrabiblos")_ (lit.'Four Books') or by its Latin equivalent _Quadripartitum_.[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-67) Its original title is unknown, but may have been a term found in some Greek manuscripts, _Apotelesmatiká_ (_biblía_), roughly meaning "(books) on the Effects" or "Outcomes", or "Prognostics".[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-Robbins-1940-intro-20)(p x) As a source of reference, the _Tetrabiblos_ is said to have "enjoyed almost the authority of a Bible among the astrological writers of a thousand years or more".[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-Robbins-1940-intro-20)(p xii) It was first translated from Arabic into Latin by [Plato of Tivoli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato_of_Tivoli "Plato of Tivoli") (Tiburtinus) in 1138, while he was in Spain.[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-Robbins-1940-68)

Much of the content of the _Tetrabiblos_ was collected from earlier sources; Ptolemy's achievement was to order his material in a systematic way, showing how the subject could, in his view, be rationalized. It is, indeed, presented as the second part of the study of astronomy of which the _Almagest_ was the first, concerned with the influences of the celestial bodies in the [sublunary sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublunary_sphere "Sublunary sphere").[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-Jones-2010-18)[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-Heilen-2010-19) Thus explanations of a sort are provided for the astrological effects of the [planets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planets "Planets"), based upon their combined effects of heating, cooling, moistening, and drying.[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-69) Ptolemy dismisses other astrological practices, such as considering the [numerological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerology "Numerology") significance of names, that he believed to be without sound basis, and leaves out popular topics, such as [electional astrology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electional_astrology "Electional astrology") (interpreting astrological charts to determine courses of action) and [medical astrology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_astrology "Medical astrology"), for similar reasons.[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-Riley1987-70)

The great respect in which later astrologers held the _Tetrabiblos_ derived from its nature as an exposition of theory, rather than as a manual.[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-Riley1987-70)

A collection of one hundred [aphorisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphorism "Aphorism") about astrology called the _[Centiloquium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centiloquium "Centiloquium")_, ascribed to Ptolemy, was widely reproduced and commented on by Arabic, Latin, and Hebrew scholars, and often bound together in medieval manuscripts after the _Tetrabiblos_ as a kind of summation.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-Jones-2020-32) It is now believed to be a much later [pseudepigraphical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudepigraph "Pseudepigraph") composition. The identity and date of the actual author of the work, referred to now as [Pseudo-Ptolemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo-Ptolemy "Pseudo-Ptolemy"), remains the subject of conjecture.[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-71)

A diagram showing [Pythagorean tuning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_tuning "Pythagorean tuning").

Ptolemy's _Harmonics_ ([Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language "Greek language"): Ἁρμονικόν) is a work in three books on [music theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_theory "Music theory") and the mathematics behind musical scales[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-72)

_Harmonics_ begins with a definition of harmonic theory, with a long exposition on the relationship between reason and sense perception in corroborating theoretical assumptions. After criticizing the approaches of his predecessors, Ptolemy argues for basing musical intervals on mathematical ratios (as opposed to the ideas advocated by followers of [Aristoxenus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristoxenus "Aristoxenus")), backed up by empirical observation (in contrast to the excessively theoretical approach of the [Pythagoreans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoreans "Pythagoreans")).[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-73)[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-74)

Ptolemy introduces the _harmonic canon_ (Greek name) or _[monochord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monochord "Monochord")_ (Latin name), which is an experimental musical apparatus that he used to measure relative pitches, and used to describe to his readers how to demonstrate the relations discussed in the following chapters for themselves. After the early exposition on to build and use monochord to test proposed tuning systems, Ptolemy proceeds to discuss [Pythagorean tuning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_tuning "Pythagorean tuning") (and how to demonstrate that their idealized musical scale fails in practice). The Pythagoreans believed that the mathematics of music should be based on only the one specific ratio of 3:2, the [perfect fifth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_fifth "Perfect fifth"), and believed that tunings mathematically exact to their system would prove to be melodious, if only the extremely large numbers involved could be calculated (by hand). To the contrary, Ptolemy believed that musical scales and tunings should in general involve multiple different ratios arranged to fit together evenly into smaller [tetrachords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrachord "Tetrachord") (combinations of four pitch ratios which together make a [perfect fourth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_fourth "Perfect fourth")) and [octaves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octave "Octave").[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-75)[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-76) Ptolemy reviewed standard (and [ancient, disused](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enharmonic_scale "Enharmonic scale")) musical tuning practice of his day, which he then compared to his own subdivisions of the [tetrachord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrachord "Tetrachord") and the [octave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octave "Octave"), which he derived experimentally using a [monochord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monochord "Monochord") / harmonic canon. The volume ends with a more speculative exposition of the relationships between harmony, the soul (_psyche_), and the planets ([harmony of the spheres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musica_universalis "Musica universalis")).[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-Feke-2012-77)

Although Ptolemy's _Harmonics_ never had the influence of his _Almagest_ or _Geography_, it is nonetheless a well-structured treatise and contains more methodological reflections than any other of his writings. In particular, it is a nascent form of what in the following millennium developed into the scientific method, with specific descriptions of the experimental apparatus that he built and used to test musical conjectures, and the empirical musical relations he identified by testing pitches against each other: He was able to accurately measure relative pitches based on the ratios of vibrating lengths two separate sides of the same [single string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monochord "Monochord"), hence which were assured to be under equal tension, eliminating one source of error. He analyzed the empirically determined ratios of "pleasant" pairs of pitches, and then synthesised all of them into a coherent mathematical description, which persists to the present as [just intonation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_intonation "Just intonation") – the standard for comparison of consonance in the many other, less-than exact but more facile [compromise tuning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meantone_temperament "Meantone temperament") systems.[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-78)[[76]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-79)

During the [Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance "Renaissance"), Ptolemy's ideas inspired [Kepler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler "Kepler") in his own musings on the harmony of the world (_[Harmonice Mundi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonices\_Mundi "Harmonices Mundi")_, Appendix to Book V).[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-80)

The _Optica_ ([Koine Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koine_Greek "Koine Greek"): Ὀπτικά), known as the _Optics_, is a work that survives only in a somewhat poor Latin version, which, in turn, was translated from a lost Arabic version by [Eugenius of Palermo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenius_of_Palermo "Eugenius of Palermo") (c. 1154). In it, Ptolemy writes about properties of sight (not light), including [reflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(physics) "Reflection (physics)"), [refraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction "Refraction"), and [colour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colour "Colour"). The work is a significant part of the early [history of optics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_optics "History of optics") and influenced the more famous and superior 11th-century _[Book of Optics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book\_of\_Optics "Book of Optics")_ by [Ibn al-Haytham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_al-Haytham "Ibn al-Haytham").[[78]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-Smith-1996-81) Ptolemy offered explanations for many phenomena concerning illumination and colour, size, shape, movement, and binocular vision. He also divided illusions into those caused by physical or optical factors and those caused by judgmental factors. He offered an obscure explanation of the Sun or [Moon illusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_illusion "Moon illusion") (the enlarged apparent size on the horizon) based on the difficulty of looking upwards.[[79]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-82)[[80]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-83)

The work is divided into three major sections. The first section (Book II) deals with direct vision from first principles and ends with a discussion of binocular vision. The second section (Books III-IV) treats [reflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(physics) "Reflection (physics)") in plane, convex, concave, and compound mirrors.[[81]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-84) The last section (Book V) deals with [refraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction "Refraction") and includes the earliest surviving table of refraction from air to water, for which the values (with the exception of the 60° angle of incidence) show signs of being obtained from an arithmetic progression.[[82]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-85) However, according to Mark Smith, Ptolemy's table was based in part on real experiments.[[83]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-86)

Ptolemy's theory of vision consisted of rays (or flux) coming from the eye forming a cone, the vertex being within the eye, and the base defining the visual field. The rays were sensitive, and conveyed information back to the observer's intellect about the distance and orientation of surfaces. Size and shape were determined by the visual angle subtended at the eye combined with perceived distance and orientation.[[78]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-Smith-1996-81)[[84]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-87) This was one of the early statements of size-distance invariance as a cause of perceptual size and shape constancy, a view supported by the Stoics.[[85]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-88)

Although mainly known for his contributions to astronomy and other scientific subjects, Ptolemy also engaged in [epistemological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology "Epistemology") and [psychological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology "Psychology") discussions across his corpus.[[86]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-Feke-2018-89) He wrote a short essay entitled _On the Criterion and Hegemonikon_ ([Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language "Greek language"): Περὶ Κριτηρίου καὶ Ἡγεμονικοῡ), which may have been one of his earliest works. Ptolemy deals specifically with how humans obtain scientific knowledge (i.e., the "criterion" of truth), as well as with the nature and structure of the human _psyche_ or soul, particularly its ruling faculty (i.e., the _hegemonikon_).[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-Feke-2012-77) Ptolemy argues that, to arrive at the truth, one should use both reason and sense perception in ways that complement each other. _On the Criterion_ is also noteworthy for being the only one of Ptolemy's works that is devoid of [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_mathematics "Greek mathematics").[[87]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-90)

Elsewhere, Ptolemy affirms the supremacy of mathematical knowledge over other forms of knowledge. Like Aristotle before him, Ptolemy classifies mathematics as a type of theoretical philosophy; however, Ptolemy believes mathematics to be superior to [theology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theology "Theology") or [metaphysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics "Metaphysics") because the latter are conjectural while only the former can secure certain knowledge. This view is contrary to the [Platonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonism "Platonism") and [Aristotelian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotelianism "Aristotelianism") traditions, where theology or metaphysics occupied the highest honour.[[86]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-Feke-2018-89) Despite being a minority position among ancient philosophers, Ptolemy's views were shared by other mathematicians such as [Hero of Alexandria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_of_Alexandria "Hero of Alexandria").[[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-91)

1.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_ref-portraits_1-0)**Since no contemporary depictions or descriptions of Ptolemy are known to have existed, later artists' impressions are unlikely to have reproduced his appearance accurately.
2.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_ref-6)** "The only place mentioned in any of Ptolemy's observations is Alexandria, and there is no reason to suppose that he ever lived anywhere else. The statement by Theodore Meliteniotes that he was born in Ptolemais Hermiou (in Upper Egypt) could be correct, but it is late (c. 1360) and unsupported." — Toomer & Jones (2018)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-5)
3.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_ref-29)** "But what we really want to know is to what extent the Alexandrian mathematicians of the period from the 1st to the 5th centuries [CE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Era "Common Era") were Greek. Certainly, all of them wrote in Greek and were part of the Greek intellectual community of Alexandria. Most modern studies conclude that the Greek community coexisted"...  ... "So should we assume that Ptolemy and Diophantus, Pappus and Hypatia were ethnically Greek, that their ancestors had come from Greece at some point in the past but had remained effectively isolated from the Egyptians? It is, of course, impossible to answer this question definitively. But research in papyri dating from the early centuries of the common era demonstrates that a significant amount of intermarriage took place between the Greek and Egyptian communities...  And it is known that Greek marriage contracts increasingly came to resemble Egyptian ones. In addition, even from the founding of Alexandria, small numbers of Egyptians were admitted to the privileged classes in the city to fulfill numerous civic roles. Of course, it was essential in such cases for the Egyptians to become "Hellenized": To adopt Greek habits and the Greek language. Given that the Alexandrian mathematicians mentioned here were active several hundred years after the founding of the city, it would seem at least equally possible that they were ethnically Egyptian as that they remained ethnically Greek. In any case, it is unreasonable to portray them with purely European features when no physical descriptions exist. — V.J. Katz (1998, p. 184)[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy#cite_note-Katz-1998-27)
