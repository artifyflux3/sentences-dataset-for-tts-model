In [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics"), **charge conjugation** is a [transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_(mathematics) "Transformation (mathematics)") that switches all [particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle "Particle") with their corresponding [antiparticles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiparticle "Antiparticle"), thus changing the sign of all [charges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge_(physics) "Charge (physics)"): not only [electric charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge "Electric charge") but also the charges relevant to other forces. The term **C-symmetry** is an abbreviation of the phrase "charge conjugation symmetry", and is used in discussions of the symmetry of physical laws under charge-conjugation. Other important discrete symmetries are [P-symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-symmetry "P-symmetry") (parity) and [T-symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-symmetry "T-symmetry") (time reversal).

These discrete symmetries, C, P and T, are symmetries of the equations that describe the known [fundamental forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_force "Fundamental force") of nature: [electromagnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetism "Electromagnetism"), [gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity "Gravity"), the [strong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_interaction "Strong interaction") and the [weak interactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_interaction "Weak interaction"). Verifying whether some given mathematical equation correctly models [nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature "Nature") requires giving physical interpretation not only to [continuous symmetries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_symmetry "Continuous symmetry"), such as [motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion "Motion") in time, but also to its [discrete symmetries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_symmetries "Discrete symmetries"), and then determining whether nature adheres to these symmetries. Unlike the continuous symmetries, the interpretation of the discrete symmetries is a bit more intellectually demanding and confusing. An early surprise appeared in the 1950s, when [Chien Shiung Wu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chien_Shiung_Wu "Chien Shiung Wu") demonstrated that the weak interaction violated P-symmetry. For several decades, it appeared that the combined symmetry CP was preserved, until [CP-violating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP_violation "CP violation") interactions were discovered. Both discoveries led to [Nobel Prizes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize "Nobel Prize").

The C-symmetry is particularly troublesome, physically, as the universe is primarily filled with [matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter "Matter"), not [anti-matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-matter "Anti-matter"), whereas the naive C-symmetry of the physical laws suggests that there should be equal amounts of both. It is currently believed that CP-violation during the early universe can account for the "excess" matter, although the debate is not settled. Earlier textbooks on [cosmology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology "Cosmology"), predating the 1970s,[_[which?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Avoid\_weasel\_words "Wikipedia:Avoid weasel words")_] routinely suggested that perhaps distant galaxies were made entirely of anti-matter, thus maintaining a net balance of zero in the universe.

This article focuses on exposing and articulating the C-symmetry of various important equations and theoretical systems, including the [Dirac equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_equation "Dirac equation") and the structure of [quantum field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory "Quantum field theory"). The various [fundamental particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_particles "Fundamental particles") can be classified according to behavior under charge conjugation; this is described in the article on [C-parity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-parity "C-parity").

Charge conjugation occurs as a symmetry in three different but closely related settings: a symmetry of the (classical, non-quantized) solutions of several notable differential equations, including the [Klein–Gordon equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein%E2%80%93Gordon_equation "Klein–Gordon equation") and the [Dirac equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_equation "Dirac equation"), a symmetry of the corresponding quantum fields, and in a general setting, a symmetry in (pseudo-)[Riemannian geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_geometry "Riemannian geometry"). In all three cases, the symmetry is ultimately revealed to be a symmetry under [complex conjugation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_conjugation "Complex conjugation"), although exactly what is being conjugated where can be at times obfuscated, depending on notation, coordinate choices and other factors.

### In classical fields

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=C-symmetry&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: In classical fields")]

The charge conjugation symmetry is interpreted as that of [electrical charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_charge "Electrical charge"), because in all three cases (classical, quantum and geometry), one can construct [Noether currents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noether_current "Noether current") that resemble those of [classical electrodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_electrodynamics "Classical electrodynamics"). This arises because electrodynamics itself, via [Maxwell's equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations "Maxwell's equations"), can be interpreted as a structure on a [U(1)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U(1) "U(1)")[fiber bundle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber_bundle "Fiber bundle"), the so-called [circle bundle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_bundle "Circle bundle"). This provides a geometric interpretation of electromagnetism: the [electromagnetic potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_potential "Electromagnetic potential")![Image 1: {\displaystyle A_{\mu }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9277f5286335ab99c040c9c9151ab752d3bedc49) is interpreted as the [gauge connection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection_(mathematics) "Connection (mathematics)") (the [Ehresmann connection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehresmann_connection "Ehresmann connection")) on the circle bundle. This geometric interpretation then allows (literally almost) anything possessing a complex-number-valued structure to be coupled to the electromagnetic field, provided that this coupling is done in a [gauge-invariant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge-invariant "Gauge-invariant") way. Gauge symmetry, in this geometric setting, is a statement that, as one moves around on the circle, the coupled object must also transform in a "circular way", tracking in a corresponding fashion. More formally, one says that the equations must be gauge invariant under a change of local [coordinate frames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_frame "Coordinate frame") on the circle. For U(1), this is just the statement that the system is invariant under multiplication by a phase factor ![Image 2: {\displaystyle e^{i\phi (x)}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/353fdaac0375b4d40470f97e8356893ac99602e1) that depends on the (space-time) coordinate ![Image 3: {\displaystyle x.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d07e9f568a88785ae48006ac3c4b951020f1699a) In this geometric setting, charge conjugation can be understood as the discrete symmetry ![Image 4: {\displaystyle z=(x+iy)\mapsto {\overline {z}}=(x-iy)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/768492cd996193cad4ed319aa5a12af85a442c04) that performs complex conjugation, that reverses the sense of direction around the circle.

In [quantum field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory "Quantum field theory"), charge conjugation can be understood as the exchange of [particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle "Particle") with [anti-particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-particle "Anti-particle"). To understand this statement, one must have a minimal understanding of what quantum field theory is. In (vastly) simplified terms, it is a technique for performing calculations to obtain solutions for a system of coupled differential equations via [perturbation theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perturbation_theory "Perturbation theory"). A key ingredient to this process is the [quantum field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field "Quantum field"), one for each of the (free, uncoupled) differential equations in the system. A quantum field is conventionally written as

![Image 5: {\displaystyle \psi (x)=\int d^{3}p\sum _{\sigma ,n}e^{-ip\cdot x}a\left({\vec {p}},\sigma ,n\right)u\left({\vec {p}},\sigma ,n\right)+e^{ip\cdot x}a^{\dagger }\left({\vec {p}},\sigma ,n\right)v\left({\vec {p}},\sigma ,n\right)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/353a6d8ddc25374284ca6ad2b008f02d30bad0e5)
where ![Image 6: {\displaystyle {\vec {p}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/84fee53c81592db54e0fe6c6f9eba002bb1dc74b) is the momentum, ![Image 7: {\displaystyle \sigma }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/59f59b7c3e6fdb1d0365a494b81fb9a696138c36) is a spin label, ![Image 8: {\displaystyle n}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b) is an auxiliary label for other states in the system. The ![Image 9: {\displaystyle a}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ffd2487510aa438433a2579450ab2b3d557e5edc) and ![Image 10: {\displaystyle a^{\dagger }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ab292dae7b377aefbd977dc19438b2b82da3303c) are [creation and annihilation operators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creation_and_annihilation_operators "Creation and annihilation operators") ([ladder operators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladder_operator "Ladder operator")) and ![Image 11: {\displaystyle u,v}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7e66f4b32a0181923cc1337a5634f38241e5c697) are solutions to the (free, non-interacting, uncoupled) differential equation in question. The quantum field plays a central role because, in general, it is not known how to obtain exact solutions to the system of coupled differential questions. However, via perturbation theory, approximate solutions can be constructed as combinations of the free-field solutions. To perform this construction, one has to be able to extract and work with any one given free-field solution, on-demand, when required. The quantum field provides exactly this: it enumerates all possible free-field solutions in a vector space such that any one of them can be singled out at any given time, via the creation and annihilation operators.

The creation and annihilation operators obey the [canonical commutation relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_commutation_relation "Canonical commutation relation"), in that the one operator "undoes" what the other "creates". This implies that any given solution ![Image 12: {\displaystyle u\left({\vec {p}},\sigma ,n\right)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/961da31bfb10a96d83f2a107f1d40a689cb190bc) must be paired with its "anti-solution" ![Image 13: {\displaystyle v\left({\vec {p}},\sigma ,n\right)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6f1468fd5db5ff4be6b85e1fe1d78537571e3367) so that one undoes or cancels out the other. The pairing is to be performed so that all symmetries are preserved. As one is generally interested in [Lorentz invariance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_invariance "Lorentz invariance"), the quantum field contains an integral over all possible Lorentz coordinate frames, written above as an integral over all possible momenta (it is an integral over the fiber of the [frame bundle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_bundle "Frame bundle")). The pairing requires that a given ![Image 14: {\displaystyle u\left({\vec {p}}\right)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/07b8105ed577fb134b9822a6fde834becf3490af) is associated with a ![Image 15: {\displaystyle v\left({\vec {p}}\right)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b0a25d49616aa5d4d9a2a90072bfdbafa698d430) of the opposite momentum and energy. The quantum field is also a sum over all possible spin states; the dual pairing again matching opposite spins. Likewise for any other quantum numbers, these are also paired as opposites. There is a technical difficulty in carrying out this dual pairing: one must describe what it means for some given solution ![Image 16: {\displaystyle u}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c3e6bb763d22c20916ed4f0bb6bd49d7470cffd8) to be "dual to" some other solution ![Image 17: {\displaystyle v,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e7ba401aee0189f8031d21020a0c640a03339c9c) and to describe it in such a way that it remains consistently dual when integrating over the fiber of the frame bundle, when integrating (summing) over the fiber that describes the spin, and when integrating (summing) over any other fibers that occur in the theory.

When the fiber to be integrated over is the U(1) fiber of electromagnetism, the dual pairing is such that the direction (orientation) on the fiber is reversed. When the fiber to be integrated over is the SU(3) fiber of the [color charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_charge "Color charge"), the dual pairing again reverses orientation. This "just works" for SU(3) because it has two dual [fundamental representations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_representation "Fundamental representation")![Image 18: {\displaystyle \mathbf {3} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c2210f71f47c2aef89cebab1b74ee6b14a05fa4b) and ![Image 19: {\displaystyle {\overline {\mathbf {3} }}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/dc137a065a85d90b74412389d43920940c95e0fa) which can be naturally paired. This prescription for a quantum field naturally generalizes to any situation where one can enumerate the continuous symmetries of the system, and define duals in a coherent, consistent fashion. The pairing ties together opposite [charges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge_(physics) "Charge (physics)") in the fully abstract sense. In physics, a charge is associated with a generator of a continuous symmetry. Different charges are associated with different eigenspaces of the [Casimir invariants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casimir_invariant "Casimir invariant") of the [universal enveloping algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_enveloping_algebra "Universal enveloping algebra") for those symmetries. This is the case for _both_ the Lorentz symmetry of the underlying [spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime "Spacetime")[manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold_(mathematics) "Manifold (mathematics)"), _as well as_ the symmetries of any fibers in the fiber bundle posed above the spacetime manifold. Duality replaces the generator of the symmetry with minus the generator. Charge conjugation is thus associated with reflection along the [line bundle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_bundle "Line bundle") or [determinant bundle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant_bundle "Determinant bundle") of the space of symmetries.

The above then is a sketch of the general idea of a quantum field in quantum field theory. The physical interpretation is that solutions ![Image 20: {\displaystyle u\left({\vec {p}},\sigma ,n\right)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/961da31bfb10a96d83f2a107f1d40a689cb190bc) correspond to particles, and solutions ![Image 21: {\displaystyle v\left({\vec {p}},\sigma ,n\right)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6f1468fd5db5ff4be6b85e1fe1d78537571e3367) correspond to antiparticles, and so charge conjugation is a pairing of the two. This sketch also provides enough hints to indicate what charge conjugation might look like in a general geometric setting. There is no particular forced requirement to use perturbation theory, to construct quantum fields that will act as middle-men in a perturbative expansion. Charge conjugation can be given a general setting.

For general [Riemannian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_manifold "Riemannian manifold") and [pseudo-Riemannian manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo-Riemannian_manifold "Pseudo-Riemannian manifold"), one has a [tangent bundle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_bundle "Tangent bundle"), a [cotangent bundle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotangent_bundle "Cotangent bundle") and a [metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_tensor "Metric tensor") that ties the two together. There are several interesting things one can do, when presented with this situation. One is that the smooth structure allows [differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation "Differential equation") to be posed on the manifold; the [tangent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_space "Tangent space") and [cotangent spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotangent_space "Cotangent space") provide enough structure to perform [calculus on manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_manifold "Differentiable manifold"). Of key interest is the [Laplacian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplacian "Laplacian"), and, with a constant term, what amounts to the Klein–Gordon operator. Cotangent bundles, by their basic construction, are always [symplectic manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symplectic_manifold "Symplectic manifold"). Symplectic manifolds have [canonical coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_coordinate "Canonical coordinate")![Image 22: {\displaystyle x,p}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b95a7ed3d2b1822eb6a28970329fa7b428219be7) interpreted as position and momentum, obeying [canonical commutation relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_commutation_relation "Canonical commutation relation"). This provides the core infrastructure to extend duality, and thus charge conjugation, to this general setting.

A second interesting thing one can do is to construct a [spin structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_structure "Spin structure"). Perhaps the most remarkable thing about this is that it is a very recognizable generalization to a ![Image 23: {\displaystyle (p,q)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9769c58523b9b639866a2d48e657d9c26911143a)-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian manifold of the conventional physics concept of [spinors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor "Spinor") living on a (1,3)-dimensional [Minkowski spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_spacetime "Minkowski spacetime"). The construction passes through a complexified [Clifford algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_algebra "Clifford algebra") to build a [Clifford bundle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_bundle "Clifford bundle") and a [spin manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_manifold "Spin manifold"). At the end of this construction, one obtains a system that is remarkably familiar, if one is already acquainted with Dirac spinors and the Dirac equation. Several analogies pass through to this general case. First, the [spinors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor "Spinor") are the [Weyl spinors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weyl_spinor "Weyl spinor"), and they come in complex-conjugate pairs. They are naturally anti-commuting (this follows from the Clifford algebra), which is exactly what one wants to make contact with the [Pauli exclusion principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_exclusion_principle "Pauli exclusion principle"). Another is the existence of a [chiral element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiral_symmetry "Chiral symmetry"), analogous to the [gamma matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_matrix "Gamma matrix")![Image 24: {\displaystyle \gamma _{5}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b94fc10f503ccc16a12b94646d8fff849fab673d) which sorts these spinors into left and right-handed subspaces. The complexification is a key ingredient, and it provides "electromagnetism" in this generalized setting. The spinor bundle doesn't "just" transform under the [pseudo-orthogonal group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo-orthogonal_group "Pseudo-orthogonal group")![Image 25: {\displaystyle SO(p,q)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ab6609eaa912527e34461522f02d0143988deb1b), the generalization of the [Lorentz group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_group "Lorentz group")![Image 26: {\displaystyle SO(1,3)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/75d864d32e8649fb29d72395093e8bdbb3f2a11b), but under a bigger group, the complexified [spin group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_group "Spin group")![Image 27: {\displaystyle \mathrm {Spin} ^{\mathbb {C} }(p,q).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/813a17eedeee15c77f105ae5b9eb7de487f2ca70) It is bigger in that it is a [double covering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_(mathematics) "Cover (mathematics)") of ![Image 28: {\displaystyle SO(p,q)\times U(1).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b2de70860c48d06563e1a4ee946ebb40500d2b41)

The ![Image 29: {\displaystyle U(1)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e62b00d74ee0cefb86cc052365625abff56d43e6) piece can be identified with electromagnetism in several different ways. One way is that the [Dirac operators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_operator "Dirac operator") on the spin manifold, when squared, contain a piece ![Image 30: {\displaystyle F=dA}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6b2177791ee25a365cdd5c5c255fc86bb37f48ca) with ![Image 31: {\displaystyle A}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3) arising from that part of the connection associated with the ![Image 32: {\displaystyle U(1)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e62b00d74ee0cefb86cc052365625abff56d43e6) piece. This is entirely analogous to what happens when one squares the ordinary Dirac equation in ordinary Minkowski spacetime. A second hint is that this ![Image 33: {\displaystyle U(1)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e62b00d74ee0cefb86cc052365625abff56d43e6) piece is associated with the [determinant bundle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant_bundle "Determinant bundle") of the spin structure, effectively tying together the left and right-handed spinors through complex conjugation.

What remains is to work through the discrete symmetries of the above construction. There are several that appear to generalize [P-symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-symmetry "P-symmetry") and [T-symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-symmetry "T-symmetry"). Identifying the ![Image 34: {\displaystyle p}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/81eac1e205430d1f40810df36a0edffdc367af36) dimensions with time, and the ![Image 35: {\displaystyle q}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/06809d64fa7c817ffc7e323f85997f783dbdf71d) dimensions with space, one can reverse the tangent vectors in the ![Image 36: {\displaystyle p}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/81eac1e205430d1f40810df36a0edffdc367af36) dimensional subspace to get time reversal, and flipping the direction of the ![Image 37: {\displaystyle q}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/06809d64fa7c817ffc7e323f85997f783dbdf71d) dimensions corresponds to parity. The C-symmetry can be identified with the reflection on the line bundle. To tie all of these together into a knot, one finally has the concept of [transposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposition_(mathematics) "Transposition (mathematics)"), in that elements of the Clifford algebra can be written in reversed (transposed) order. The net result is that not only do the conventional physics ideas of fields pass over to the general Riemannian setting, but also the ideas of the discrete symmetries.

There are two ways to react to this. One is to treat it as an interesting curiosity. The other is to realize that, in low dimensions (in low-dimensional spacetime) there are many "accidental" isomorphisms between various [Lie groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_group "Lie group") and other assorted structures. Being able to examine them in a general setting disentangles these relationships, exposing more clearly "where things come from".

Charge conjugation for Dirac fields
-----------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=C-symmetry&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Charge conjugation for Dirac fields")]

The laws of [electromagnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetism "Electromagnetism") (both [classical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_physics "Classical physics") and [quantum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum "Quantum")) are [invariant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariant_(physics) "Invariant (physics)") under the exchange of electrical charges with their negatives. For the case of [electrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron "Electron") and [quarks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark "Quark"), both of which are [fundamental particle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_particle "Fundamental particle")[fermion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermion "Fermion") fields, the single-particle field excitations are described by the [Dirac equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_equation "Dirac equation")

A handful of algebraic manipulations are sufficient to obtain the second from the first.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-symmetry#cite_note-Bjorken-Drell-1964-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-symmetry#cite_note-Itzykson-Zuber-1980-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-symmetry#cite_note-PS-3) Standard expositions of the Dirac equation demonstrate a conjugate field ![Image 40: {\displaystyle {\overline {\psi }}=\psi ^{\dagger }\gamma ^{0},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8b589b5b50169bcf917904d2ef597f9b3a89a9de) interpreted as an anti-particle field, satisfying the complex-transposed Dirac equation

Curiously, this form is not representation-independent, but depends on the specific matrix representation chosen for the [gamma group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_group "Gamma group") (the subgroup of the [Clifford algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_algebra "Clifford algebra") capturing the algebraic properties of the [gamma matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_matrices "Gamma matrices")). This matrix is representation dependent due to a subtle interplay involving the complexification of the [spin group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_group "Spin group") describing the Lorentz covariance of charged particles.

### Charge conjugation, chirality, helicity

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=C-symmetry&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Charge conjugation, chirality, helicity")]

The interplay between chirality and charge conjugation is a bit subtle, and requires articulation. It is often said that charge conjugation does not alter the [chirality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chirality_(physics) "Chirality (physics)") of particles. This is not the case for _fields_, the difference arising in the "hole theory" interpretation of particles, where an anti-particle is interpreted as the absence of a particle. This is articulated below.

Conventionally, ![Image 49: {\displaystyle \gamma _{5}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b94fc10f503ccc16a12b94646d8fff849fab673d) is used as the chirality operator. Under charge conjugation, it transforms as

![Image 50: {\displaystyle C\gamma _{5}C^{-1}=\gamma _{5}^{\textsf {T}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4c2ceafd09b3d0331b819182092441680890654b)
and whether or not ![Image 51: {\displaystyle \gamma _{5}^{\textsf {T}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3cdf11e9e891067da167220c2a21ef39163c036e) equals ![Image 52: {\displaystyle \gamma _{5}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b94fc10f503ccc16a12b94646d8fff849fab673d) depends on the chosen representation for the gamma matrices. In the Dirac and chiral basis, one does have that ![Image 53: {\displaystyle \gamma _{5}^{\textsf {T}}=\gamma _{5}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a4befceb69b0190fefd71fca5ae283b1c19945b3), while ![Image 54: {\displaystyle \gamma _{5}^{\textsf {T}}=-\gamma _{5}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d010f709f1e6d66a27dae99ec8b193698da61cab) is obtained in the Majorana basis. A worked example follows.

For the case of massless Dirac spinor fields, chirality is equal to helicity for the positive energy solutions (and minus the helicity for negative energy solutions).[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-symmetry#cite_note-Itzykson-Zuber-1980-2): §2-4-3, page 87 ff  One obtains this by writing the massless Dirac equation as

![Image 55: {\displaystyle i\partial \!\!\!{\big /}\psi =0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ecefdc53501ad26b4766c22e55adca8de1196852)
Multiplying by ![Image 56: {\displaystyle \gamma ^{5}\gamma ^{0}=-i\gamma ^{1}\gamma ^{2}\gamma ^{3}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ec18359fb8277597efd6653dce6b99b4e4bd6ac5) one obtains

![Image 57: {\displaystyle {\epsilon _{ij}}^{m}\sigma ^{ij}\partial _{m}\psi =\gamma _{5}\partial _{t}\psi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6db79e63bb9dcda18b0d7eafca80face4781b227)
where ![Image 58: {\displaystyle \sigma ^{\mu \nu }=i\left[\gamma ^{\mu },\gamma ^{\nu }\right]/2}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a4b313fd46f9dca789d6003848ca4cf297146aaf) is the [angular momentum operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_momentum_operator "Angular momentum operator") and ![Image 59: {\displaystyle \epsilon _{ijk}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/80cacf43cd468e0f17c0945c0aecaa8d7c57ac99) is the [totally antisymmetric tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totally_antisymmetric_tensor "Totally antisymmetric tensor"). This can be brought to a slightly more recognizable form by defining the 3D spin operator ![Image 60: {\displaystyle \Sigma ^{m}\equiv {\epsilon _{ij}}^{m}\sigma ^{ij},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6a9c789d784c013b8c2d34395c79bde375427c8c) taking a plane-wave state ![Image 61: {\displaystyle \psi (x)=e^{-ik\cdot x}\psi (k)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f30a63ba6b84f2258b7896c3e7b4296b7923656d), applying the on-shell constraint that ![Image 62: {\displaystyle k\cdot k=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bb25b182269f74bbd083fef5cab03ef19eb8cea7) and normalizing the momentum to be a 3D unit vector: ![Image 63: {\displaystyle {\hat {k}}_{i}=k_{i}/k_{0}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/48494ae48150d08d736ed36e9c4832f6e2f040f7) to write

![Image 64: {\displaystyle \left(\Sigma \cdot {\hat {k}}\right)\psi =\gamma _{5}\psi ~.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/65c0e1b28a7d646ff9232cc2a33def84dee37fb7)
Examining the above, one concludes that angular momentum eigenstates ([helicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicity_(particle_physics) "Helicity (particle physics)") eigenstates) correspond to eigenstates of the [chiral operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chirality_(physics) "Chirality (physics)"). This allows the massless Dirac field to be cleanly split into a pair of [Weyl spinors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weyl_spinor "Weyl spinor")![Image 65: {\displaystyle \psi _{\text{L}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ff7518d95340e4d01c3bca68d39f30b4b4b99e18) and ![Image 66: {\displaystyle \psi _{\text{R}},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0e413d04ebb19353a2bd243b79ccc6d5a75a901b) each individually satisfying the [Weyl equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weyl_equation "Weyl equation"), but with opposite energy:

![Image 67: {\displaystyle \left(-p_{0}+\sigma \cdot {\vec {p}}\right)\psi _{\text{R}}=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/35ea5fef0b721326eea2ef89c30e9440144f6fd5)
and

![Image 68: {\displaystyle \left(p_{0}+\sigma \cdot {\vec {p}}\right)\psi _{\text{L}}=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d810fd6c5938f8e80fcfb15fa9fd8e9652ca2e04)
Note the freedom one has to equate negative helicity with negative energy, and thus the anti-particle with the particle of opposite helicity. To be clear, the ![Image 69: {\displaystyle \sigma }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/59f59b7c3e6fdb1d0365a494b81fb9a696138c36) here are the [Pauli matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_matrices "Pauli matrices"), and ![Image 70: {\displaystyle p_{\mu }=i\partial _{\mu }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d0846761e0712cda72fa489ac393b9674d94b9f3) is the momentum operator.

#### Charge conjugation in the chiral basis

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=C-symmetry&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Charge conjugation in the chiral basis")]

Taking the [Weyl representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_matrices#Weyl_representation "Gamma matrices") of the gamma matrices, one may write a (now taken to be massive) Dirac spinor as

![Image 71: {\displaystyle \psi ={\begin{pmatrix}\psi _{\text{L}}\\\psi _{\text{R}}\end{pmatrix}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f72bf48d19502dff054dc7496786bb514a3ed6bd)
The corresponding dual (anti-particle) field is

![Image 72: {\displaystyle {\overline {\psi }}^{\textsf {T}}=\left(\psi ^{\dagger }\gamma ^{0}\right)^{\textsf {T}}={\begin{pmatrix}0&I\\I&0\end{pmatrix}}{\begin{pmatrix}\psi _{\text{L}}^{*}\\\psi _{\text{R}}^{*}\end{pmatrix}}={\begin{pmatrix}\psi _{\text{R}}^{*}\\\psi _{\text{L}}^{*}\end{pmatrix}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a4bf804f0caddc99ad90a25b82869af77d5ef220)
The charge-conjugate spinors are

![Image 73: {\displaystyle \psi ^{c}={\begin{pmatrix}\psi _{\text{L}}^{c}\\\psi _{\text{R}}^{c}\end{pmatrix}}=\eta _{c}C{\overline {\psi }}^{\textsf {T}}=\eta _{c}{\begin{pmatrix}-i\sigma ^{2}&0\\0&i\sigma ^{2}\end{pmatrix}}{\begin{pmatrix}\psi _{\text{R}}^{*}\\\psi _{\text{L}}^{*}\end{pmatrix}}=\eta _{c}{\begin{pmatrix}-i\sigma ^{2}\psi _{\text{R}}^{*}\\i\sigma ^{2}\psi _{\text{L}}^{*}\end{pmatrix}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b38634f3956b89c119203df9e2d3f6239fd109a8)
where, as before, ![Image 74: {\displaystyle \eta _{c}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9cf6da182347dff3657dba35cc4add274134e352) is a phase factor that can be taken to be ![Image 75: {\displaystyle \eta _{c}=1.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/399187443104e8cd2ba67d1f9f379467a99487af) Note that the left and right states are inter-changed. This can be restored with a parity transformation. Under [parity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-symmetry "P-symmetry"), the Dirac spinor transforms as

![Image 76: {\displaystyle \psi \left(t,{\vec {x}}\right)\mapsto \psi ^{p}\left(t,{\vec {x}}\right)=\gamma ^{0}\psi \left(t,-{\vec {x}}\right)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/155bb8c714da762b10163426fdd89f048ed93c41)
Under combined charge and parity, one then has

![Image 77: {\displaystyle \psi \left(t,{\vec {x}}\right)\mapsto \psi ^{cp}\left(t,{\vec {x}}\right)={\begin{pmatrix}\psi _{\text{L}}^{cp}\left(t,{\vec {x}}\right)\\\psi _{\text{R}}^{cp}\left(t,{\vec {x}}\right)\end{pmatrix}}=\eta _{c}{\begin{pmatrix}-i\sigma ^{2}\psi _{\text{L}}^{*}\left(t,-{\vec {x}}\right)\\i\sigma ^{2}\psi _{\text{R}}^{*}\left(t,-{\vec {x}}\right)\end{pmatrix}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6a58471c0cd8ed0f22a07b52351b9816e695791f)
Conventionally, one takes ![Image 78: {\displaystyle \eta _{c}=1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7ffc7826aade9d26de389c21801d3062f2598e69) globally. See however, the note below.

The [Majorana condition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majorana_equation "Majorana equation") imposes a constraint between the field and its charge conjugate, namely that they must be equal: ![Image 79: {\displaystyle \psi =\psi ^{c}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c11d91c73192494e25afcad079c782cd89eddb3b) This is perhaps best stated as the requirement that the Majorana spinor must be an eigenstate of the charge conjugation involution.

Doing so requires some notational care. In many texts discussing charge conjugation, the involution ![Image 80: {\displaystyle \psi \mapsto \psi ^{c}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/54e0d9c04d82ec4be07b2f4383badddbe17ddfb4) is not given an explicit symbolic name, when applied to _single-particle solutions_ of the Dirac equation. This is in contrast to the case when the _quantized field_ is discussed, where a unitary operator ![Image 81: {\displaystyle {\mathcal {C}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e7b3edab7022ca9e2976651bc59c489513ee9019) is defined (as done in a later section, below). For the present section, let the involution be named as ![Image 82: {\displaystyle {\mathsf {C}}:\psi \mapsto \psi ^{c}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/db81539627d1b0cf6fe1cfe8437b4b4fb8054d23) so that ![Image 83: {\displaystyle {\mathsf {C}}\psi =\psi ^{c}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6d74fe7d84c4d755c8dcedfed242b6d7c62f5b5c) Taking this to be a linear operator, one may consider its eigenstates. The Majorana condition singles out one such: ![Image 84: {\displaystyle {\mathsf {C}}\psi =\psi .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/cee88694eaa93eb4b7acc235026950603f2251b9) There are, however, two such eigenstates: ![Image 85: {\displaystyle {\mathsf {C}}\psi ^{(\pm )}=\pm \psi ^{(\pm )}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2f2330d15ee1100c3626418489aa2aa66c98d410) Continuing in the Weyl basis, as above, these eigenstates are

![Image 86: {\displaystyle \psi ^{(+)}={\begin{pmatrix}\psi _{\text{L}}\\i\sigma ^{2}\psi _{\text{L}}^{*}\end{pmatrix}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/56caed1e5fa3c01a893fe375bc873e817c5b8330)
and

![Image 87: {\displaystyle \psi ^{(-)}={\begin{pmatrix}i\sigma ^{2}\psi _{\text{R}}^{*}\\\psi _{\text{R}}\end{pmatrix}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f775962481398431289a5d351845512e2712c461)
The Majorana spinor is conventionally taken as just the positive eigenstate, namely ![Image 88: {\displaystyle \psi ^{(+)}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/31a33a320a5b444e090295748d71c5302d02073d) The chiral operator ![Image 89: {\displaystyle \gamma _{5}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b94fc10f503ccc16a12b94646d8fff849fab673d) exchanges these two, in that

![Image 90: {\displaystyle \gamma _{5}{\mathsf {C}}=-{\mathsf {C}}\gamma _{5}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ab99b111ea4264c0d30b69d91b95f2d624505ebb)
This is readily verified by direct substitution. Bear in mind that ![Image 91: {\displaystyle {\mathsf {C}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/699cb4847ecedddeeae2b69e2892ba9987f9b1d1)_does **not** have_ a 4×4 matrix representation! More precisely, there is no complex 4×4 matrix that can take a complex number to its complex conjugate; this inversion would require an 8×8 real matrix. The physical interpretation of complex conjugation as charge conjugation becomes clear when considering the complex conjugation of scalar fields, described in a subsequent section below.

The projectors onto the chiral eigenstates can be written as ![Image 92: {\displaystyle P_{\text{L}}=\left(1-\gamma _{5}\right)/2}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c5fdd1d384c5df2216c6085242d8b861e537eb6e) and ![Image 93: {\displaystyle P_{\text{R}}=\left(1+\gamma _{5}\right)/2,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/34c2f1847f94c70d78b86e34655846b1ebabe688) and so the above translates to

![Image 94: {\displaystyle P_{\text{L}}{\mathsf {C}}={\mathsf {C}}P_{\text{R}}~.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0a20f8d92d248ce08e0d12d1208362b9d3b0f202)
This directly demonstrates that charge conjugation, applied to single-particle complex-number-valued solutions of the Dirac equation flips the chirality of the solution. The projectors onto the charge conjugation eigenspaces are ![Image 95: {\displaystyle P^{(+)}=(1+{\mathsf {C}})P_{\text{L}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/743463d0420d2025e8274764a7e4126805885a53) and ![Image 96: {\displaystyle P^{(-)}=(1-{\mathsf {C}})P_{\text{R}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3d396ca14b5a18786db76a73f799f11ac77c6606)

#### Geometric interpretation

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=C-symmetry&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Geometric interpretation")]

The phase factor ![Image 97: {\displaystyle \ \eta _{c}\ }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/873c5076bff2ac19203b7a927a249cdd244a7ee4) can be given a geometric interpretation. It has been noted that, for massive Dirac spinors, the "arbitrary" phase factor ![Image 98: {\displaystyle \ \eta _{c}\ }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/873c5076bff2ac19203b7a927a249cdd244a7ee4) may depend on both the momentum, and the helicity (but not the chirality).[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-symmetry#cite_note-4) This can be interpreted as saying that this phase may vary along the fiber of the [spinor bundle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor_bundle "Spinor bundle"), depending on the local choice of a coordinate frame. Put another way, a spinor field is a local [section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_(fiber_bundle) "Section (fiber bundle)") of the spinor bundle, and Lorentz boosts and rotations correspond to movements along the fibers of the corresponding [frame bundle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_bundle "Frame bundle") (again, just a choice of local coordinate frame). Examined in this way, this extra phase freedom can be interpreted as the phase arising from the electromagnetic field. For the [Majorana spinors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majorana_spinor "Majorana spinor"), the phase would be constrained to not vary under boosts and rotations.

### Charge conjugation for quantized fields

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=C-symmetry&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Charge conjugation for quantized fields")]

The above describes charge conjugation for the single-particle solutions only. When the Dirac field is [second-quantized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-quantized "Second-quantized"), as in [quantum field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory "Quantum field theory"), the spinor and electromagnetic fields are described by operators. The charge conjugation involution then manifests as a [unitary operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitary_operator "Unitary operator")![Image 99: {\displaystyle {\mathcal {C}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e7b3edab7022ca9e2976651bc59c489513ee9019) (in calligraphic font) acting on the particle fields, expressed as[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-symmetry#cite_note-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-symmetry#cite_note-6)

Charge conjugation does not alter the [chirality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chirality_(physics) "Chirality (physics)") of particles. A left-handed [neutrino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrino "Neutrino") would be taken by charge conjugation into a left-handed [antineutrino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antineutrino "Antineutrino"), which does not interact in the Standard Model. This property is what is meant by the "maximal violation" of C-symmetry in the weak interaction.

Some postulated extensions of the [Standard Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model "Standard Model"), like [left-right models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-right_model "Left-right model"), restore this C-symmetry.

The Dirac field has a "hidden" ![Image 104: {\displaystyle U(1)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e62b00d74ee0cefb86cc052365625abff56d43e6) gauge freedom, allowing it to couple directly to the electromagnetic field without any further modifications to the Dirac equation or the field itself.[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-symmetry#cite_note-7) This is not the case for [scalar fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_field "Scalar field"), which must be explicitly "complexified" to couple to electromagnetism. This is done by "tensoring in" an additional factor of the [complex plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_plane "Complex plane")![Image 105: {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f9add4085095b9b6d28d045fd9c92c2c09f549a7) into the field, or constructing a [Cartesian product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_product "Cartesian product") with ![Image 106: {\displaystyle U(1)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e62b00d74ee0cefb86cc052365625abff56d43e6).

One very conventional technique is simply to start with two real scalar fields, ![Image 107: {\displaystyle \phi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/72b1f30316670aee6270a28334bdf4f5072cdde4) and ![Image 108: {\displaystyle \chi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/656111758322ace96d80a9371771aa6d3de25437) and create a linear combination

![Image 109: {\displaystyle \psi \mathrel {\stackrel {\mathrm {def} }{=}} {\phi +i\chi  \over {\sqrt {2}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/443d6173a54803248f957619f0cb2a17b1c331f6)
The charge conjugation [involution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Involution_(mathematics) "Involution (mathematics)") is then the mapping ![Image 110: {\displaystyle {\mathsf {C}}:i\mapsto -i}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2f72860eb47ba9116126bad1a2f8a72908951411) since this is sufficient to reverse the sign on the electromagnetic potential (since this complex number is being used to couple to it). For real scalar fields, charge conjugation is just the identity map: ![Image 111: {\displaystyle {\mathsf {C}}:\phi \mapsto \phi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6c4aae9f75078f7e7193333ed0ac1a555d4d8caf) and ![Image 112: {\displaystyle {\mathsf {C}}:\chi \mapsto \chi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/22ec301f1d53bdcf10b707d783d872e06813c5f5) and so, for the complexified field, charge conjugation is just ![Image 113: {\displaystyle {\mathsf {C}}:\psi \mapsto \psi ^{*}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/cb231d355211b56824f39e4114425d986dff667a) The "mapsto" arrow ![Image 114: {\displaystyle \mapsto }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bc09de045e7d82eef9fe078e7e7606576640c11b) is convenient for tracking "what goes where"; the equivalent older notation is simply to write ![Image 115: {\displaystyle {\mathsf {C}}\phi =\phi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9281518a514dc46f866cff232ff2c8b61aa3df68) and ![Image 116: {\displaystyle {\mathsf {C}}\chi =\chi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2dc5195bd016ab0ff4449cc36ef1dd1ca691ca5c) and ![Image 117: {\displaystyle {\mathsf {C}}\psi =\psi ^{*}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a2da04ccb8604746e21ec0e90440ac41cf76783d)

The above describes the conventional construction of a charged scalar field. It is also possible to introduce additional algebraic structure into the fields in other ways. In particular, one may define a "real" field behaving as ![Image 118: {\displaystyle {\mathsf {C}}:\phi \mapsto -\phi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2ae03ffbaf7da6c26bf1843d0e5ab9985d653cd1). As it is real, it cannot couple to electromagnetism by itself, but, when complexified, would result in a charged field that transforms as ![Image 119: {\displaystyle {\mathsf {C}}:\psi \mapsto -\psi ^{*}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/060d0bac5d7a94d67cb1eb9a6a20338f838b9837) Because C-symmetry is a [discrete symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_symmetry "Discrete symmetry"), one has some freedom to play these kinds of algebraic games in the search for a theory that correctly models some given physical reality.

In physics literature, a transformation such as ![Image 120: {\displaystyle {\mathsf {C}}:\phi \mapsto \phi ^{c}=-\phi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a281b49743d62d6dadf7eeec7a931d2716cae493) might be written without any further explanation. The formal mathematical interpretation of this is that the field ![Image 121: {\displaystyle \phi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/72b1f30316670aee6270a28334bdf4f5072cdde4) is an element of ![Image 122: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} \times \mathbb {Z} _{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/beec2cf2a902fb46eb8d00326b574dd6c4040768) where ![Image 123: {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} _{2}=\{+1,-1\}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7304ed034fd9b27515a71c7067742a8001451981) Thus, properly speaking, the field should be written as ![Image 124: {\displaystyle \phi =(r,c)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4e3a28541e739b87444405c07ed1e2bc574da551) which behaves under charge conjugation as ![Image 125: {\displaystyle {\mathsf {C}}:(r,c)\mapsto (r,-c).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/47d3a8e42e7b8a1b9f523152d770c92e6063cb1a) It is very tempting, but not quite formally correct to just multiply these out, to move around the location of this minus sign; this mostly "just works", but a failure to track it properly will lead to confusion.

Combination of charge and parity reversal
-----------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=C-symmetry&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Combination of charge and parity reversal")]

It was believed for some time that C-symmetry could be combined with the [parity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_(physics) "Parity (physics)")-inversion transformation (see [P-symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-symmetry "P-symmetry")) to preserve a combined [CP-symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP-symmetry "CP-symmetry"). However, violations of this symmetry have been identified in the weak interactions (particularly in the [kaons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaon "Kaon") and B [mesons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meson "Meson")). In the Standard Model, this [CP violation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP_violation "CP violation") is due to a single phase in the [CKM matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CKM_matrix "CKM matrix"). If CP is combined with time reversal ([T-symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-symmetry "T-symmetry")), the resulting [CPT-symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPT-symmetry "CPT-symmetry") can be shown using only the [Wightman axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wightman_axioms "Wightman axioms") to be universally obeyed.

In general settings
-------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=C-symmetry&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: In general settings")]

The analog of charge conjugation can be defined for [higher-dimensional gamma matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-dimensional_gamma_matrices "Higher-dimensional gamma matrices"), with an explicit construction for Weyl spinors given in the article on [Weyl–Brauer matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weyl%E2%80%93Brauer_matrices "Weyl–Brauer matrices"). Note, however, spinors as defined abstractly in the representation theory of [Clifford algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_algebra "Clifford algebra") are not fields; rather, they should be thought of as existing on a zero-dimensional spacetime.

The analog of [T-symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-symmetry "T-symmetry") follows from ![Image 126: {\displaystyle \gamma ^{1}\gamma ^{3}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2e032560547485324ec4f585e6b601c958994423) as the T-conjugation operator for Dirac spinors. Spinors also have an inherent [P-symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-symmetry "P-symmetry"), obtained by reversing the direction of all of the basis vectors of the [Clifford algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_algebra "Clifford algebra") from which the spinors are constructed. The relationship to the P and T symmetries for a fermion field on a spacetime manifold are a bit subtle, but can be roughly characterized as follows. When a spinor is constructed via a Clifford algebra, the construction requires a vector space on which to build. By convention, this vector space is the [tangent space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_space "Tangent space") of the spacetime manifold at a given, fixed spacetime point (a single fiber in the [tangent manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_manifold "Tangent manifold")). P and T operations applied to the spacetime manifold can then be understood as also flipping the coordinates of the tangent space as well; thus, the two are glued together. Flipping the parity or the direction of time in one also flips it in the other. This is a convention. One can become unglued by failing to propagate this connection.

This is done by taking the tangent space as a [vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space"), extending it to a [tensor algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_algebra "Tensor algebra"), and then using an [inner product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_product "Inner product") on the vector space to define a [Clifford algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_algebra "Clifford algebra"). Treating each such algebra as a fiber, one obtains a [fiber bundle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber_bundle "Fiber bundle") called the [Clifford bundle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_bundle "Clifford bundle"). Under a change of basis of the tangent space, elements of the Clifford algebra transform according to the [spin group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_group "Spin group"). Building a [principle fiber bundle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_fiber_bundle "Principle fiber bundle") with the spin group as the fiber results in a [spin structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_structure "Spin structure").

All that is missing in the above paragraphs are the [spinors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor "Spinor") themselves. These require the "complexification" of the tangent manifold: tensoring it with the complex plane. Once this is done, the [Weyl spinors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weyl_spinor "Weyl spinor") can be constructed. These have the form

![Image 127: {\displaystyle w_{j}={\frac {1}{\sqrt {2}}}\left(e_{2j}-ie_{2j+1}\right)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/dcbada1b04e1b4911b44b44636edca7f1975e1d1)

![Image 132: {\displaystyle V\otimes \mathbb {C} =W\oplus {\overline {W}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d619b3ec005c86390b8c787a0924c2747f97b578)
