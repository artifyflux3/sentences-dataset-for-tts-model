The Global Southeast is the southeastern region of the Eastern Hemisphere . There are varying definitions, with South and Southeast Asia always included, and broader definitions including North Africa and the Middle East .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] It is becoming an increasingly economically relevant region on the world stage, [ 3 ] though it is also projected to have problems with climate change accelerating refugee crises and conflicts in the region.

[ 4 ] Many Southeastern countries are undergoing rapid urbanization, and generally have significant amounts of ethnic diversity.

[ 5 ] Relations between Global Northwest and Global Southeast [ edit ] Immigrants from the Global Southeast to the Global Northwest are often perceived as backwards, and in some ways, a threat to the body politic of their host nation, with the amount of time or generations a migrant family has spent in their host country determining how modernized or civilized they are perceived to have become.

[ 6 ] The EU High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell , when commenting on the impact of the Russo-Ukrainian War , said that a division may emerge between the Global Northwest and the Global Southeast.
