It signals an intent and a thought, but does not specify what it is.

Marc Andreessen describes "one-bit communication" as having no content other than that it exists.

[ 1 ] Examples of one-bit messages in the real world include the sound of a car horn, a police siren, [ 1 ] and an "open" sign on a retail store.

[ 1 ] Telephone calls which are deliberately terminated before being answered are also an example of one-bit communication.

In probability [ edit ] One-bit messages can be used to communicate the outcome of situations with two potential outcomes, such as a coin toss.

[ 2 ] [ disputed – discuss ] Online messaging [ edit ] In the online world, one-bit messages solve a set of communication initiative problems: [ citation needed ] Fear of initiation: "How should I kick off the conversation? It's a daunting task." Fear of rejection: "What if the other person replies 'sorry, I'm in the middle of something'?" Fear of inconveniencing someone: "A messenger shows that the other person is available, but maybe he is actually busy." Fear of being ignored: "What if I message her, and she doesn't respond or goes offline immediately?" Topic overload: "So many topics to talk about, which one should I start with?" Lack of topic: "I simply want to say to my friend that I thought of her, without anything specific to say." Fear of a conversation of unpredictable length: "I have time for a short chat, but how do I cut it off if the conversation develops?" Unwillingness to type: "I'm on my mobile, and don't want to type." Fear of follow-up: "What if the person I message will want to meet? I don't want to meet him." There are several platforms that enable sending one-bit messages including Yo and the Facebook poke .
