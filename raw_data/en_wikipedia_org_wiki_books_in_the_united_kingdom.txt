Books are understood as "written or printed work consisting of pages glued or sewn together along one side and bound in covers".

History [ edit ] See also: Global spread of the printing press Scribes produced handwritten manuscript books for many hundreds of years before the printing press was introduced in the British Isles. In 1477 William Caxton in Westminster printed The Dictes or Sayengis of the Philosophres , considered "the first dated book printed in England." [ 1 ] Publishers [ edit ] As of 2018 [update] , seven firms in the United Kingdom rank among the world's biggest publishers of books in terms of revenue: Bloomsbury , Cambridge University Press , Informa , Oxford University Press , Pearson , Quarto , and RELX Group .

[ 2 ] [ nb 1 ] Bookselling [ edit ] Main article: Book trade in the United Kingdom See also: Category:Bookshops of the United Kingdom and Booksellers Association of the UK and Ireland The Antiquarian Booksellers Association formed in 1906, and the Provincial Booksellers Fairs Association in 1972.

[ 5 ] Collections [ edit ] See also: Category:Libraries in the United Kingdom and List of libraries in Scotland The University of Oxford's Bodleian Library was founded in 1602.

The British Library was formally established in 1973, its collection previously part of the British Museum (est. 1753).

The Legal Deposit Libraries Act 2003 stipulates that the British Library receives a copy of every printed work published in the United Kingdom. Five other libraries are entitled to copies: Cambridge University Library , University of Oxford's Bodleian Library, the National Library of Scotland , the Library of Trinity College, Dublin , and the National Library of Wales . The London-based Copyright Agency became the Edinburgh-based Agency for the Legal Deposit Libraries in 2009.

[ 6 ] Clubs [ edit ] " Richard & Judy Book Club ", broadcast on Channel 4 TV " Bookclub ", on BBC Radio 4 Digitization [ edit ] US-based Google Inc.

began scanning pages of Bodleian Library volumes in 2005, as part of its new Google Books Library Project .
