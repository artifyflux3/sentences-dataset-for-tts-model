Striate cortex (Brodmann area 17) is shown in red.

Details Identifiers Latin area extrastriata NeuroLex ID nlx_anat_200905010 Anatomical terms of neuroanatomy [ edit on Wikidata ] The extrastriate cortex is the region of the occipital cortex of the mammalian brain located next to the primary visual cortex .  Primary visual cortex (V1) is also named striate cortex because of its striped appearance in the microscope. The extrastriate cortex encompasses multiple functional areas, including V3 , V4 , V5/MT , which is sensitive to motion, [ 1 ] or the extrastriate body area (EBA) used in the perception of human bodies.

[ 2 ] Anatomy [ edit ] In terms of Brodmann areas , the extrastriate cortex comprises Brodmann area 18 and Brodmann area 19 , while the striate cortex comprises Brodmann area 17 .

[ 3 ] In primates, the extrastriate cortex includes visual area V3 , visual area V4 , and visual area MT (sometimes called V5), [ 3 ] while V1 corresponds to the striate cortex, and V2 to the prestriate cortex.
