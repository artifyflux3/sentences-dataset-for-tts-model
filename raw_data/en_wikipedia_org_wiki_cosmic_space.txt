( June 2022 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) In mathematics , particularly topology , a cosmic space is any topological space that is a continuous image of some separable metric space . Equivalently (for regular T 1 spaces but not in general), a space is cosmic if and only if it has a countable network; namely a countable collection of subsets of the space such that any open set is the union of a subcollection of these sets.

Cosmic spaces have several interesting properties. There are a number of unsolved problems about them.

Examples and properties [ edit ] Any open subset of a cosmic space is cosmic since open subsets of separable spaces are separable.

Separable metric spaces are trivially cosmic.

Unsolved problems [ edit ] It is unknown as to whether X is cosmic if: a) X 2 contains no uncountable discrete space ; b) the countable product of X with itself is hereditarily separable and hereditarily Lindelöf .
