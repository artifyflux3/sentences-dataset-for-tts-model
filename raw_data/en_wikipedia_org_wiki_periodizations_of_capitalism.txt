The best-known periodizations that have been proposed distinguish these stages as: Early / monopoly / state monopoly capitalism ( Sweezy ) Free trade / monopoly / finance capitalism ( Hilferding ) Early capitalism ( primitive accumulation ) / colonialism / imperialism ( Hobson , Lenin, Bukharin) Extensive stage / intensive stage / late capitalism ( Aglietta ) The Marxist periodization of capitalism into the stages: [ 1 ] agricultural capitalism, merchant capitalism , industrial capitalism and state capitalism .

Another periodization includes merchant capitalism , industrial and finance capitalism , and global capitalism .
