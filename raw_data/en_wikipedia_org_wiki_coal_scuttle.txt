Description [ edit ] A coal scuttle at Berrington Hall Coal scuttles are usually made of metal and shaped as a vertical cylinder or truncated cone , with the open top slanted for pouring coal on a fire. It may have one or two handles.

[ 1 ] Homes that do not use coal sometimes use a coal scuttle decoratively.

[ 2 ] Origin [ edit ] The word scuttle comes, via Middle English and Old English, from the Latin word scutulla , meaning "serving platter".

[ 3 ] An alternative name, hod , derives from the Old French hotte , meaning " 'basket to carry on the back', apparently from Frankish *hotta or some other Germanic source (compare Middle High German hotze 'cradle')", and is also used in reference to boxes used to carry bricks or other construction materials.

[ 4 ] Infamous use [ edit ] In 1917, the Swedish serial killer Hilda Nilsson used a coal scuttle, a large bucket, and a washboard to drown children that she had been hired to care for.

[ 5 ] The infamous German Stahlhelm , or Steel Helmet, is sometimes referred to in English-language publications as the "Coal Scuttle" helmet, due to its shape resembling that of a coal scuttle.
