The NIG distribution was noted by Blaesild in 1977 as a subclass of the generalised hyperbolic distribution discovered by Ole Barndorff-Nielsen .

[ 2 ] In the next year Barndorff-Nielsen published the NIG in another paper.

[ 3 ] It was introduced in the mathematical finance literature in 1997.

[ 4 ] The parameters of the normal-inverse Gaussian distribution are often used to construct a heaviness and skewness plot called the NIG-triangle.

[ 5 ] Properties [ edit ] Moments [ edit ] The fact that there is a simple expression for the moment generating function implies that simple expressions for all moments are available.

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] Linear transformation [ edit ] This class is closed under affine transformations , since it is a particular case of the Generalized hyperbolic distribution , which has the same property. If x ∼ ∼ N I G ( α α , β β , δ δ , μ μ ) and y = a x + b , {\displaystyle x\sim {\mathcal {NIG}}(\alpha ,\beta ,\delta ,\mu ){\text{ and }}y=ax+b,} then [ 8 ] y ∼ ∼ N I G ( α α | a | , β β a , | a | δ δ , a μ μ + b ) .

{\displaystyle y\sim {\mathcal {NIG}}{\bigl (}{\frac {\alpha }{\left|a\right|}},{\frac {\beta }{a}},\left|a\right|\delta ,a\mu +b{\bigr )}.} Summation [ edit ] This class is infinitely divisible , since it is a particular case of the Generalized hyperbolic distribution , which has the same property.

Convolution [ edit ] The class of normal-inverse Gaussian distributions is closed under convolution in the following sense: [ 9 ] if X 1 {\displaystyle X_{1}} and X 2 {\displaystyle X_{2}} are independent random variables that are NIG-distributed with the same values of the parameters α α {\displaystyle \alpha } and β β {\displaystyle \beta } , but possibly different values of the location and scale parameters, μ μ 1 {\displaystyle \mu _{1}} , δ δ 1 {\displaystyle \delta _{1}} and μ μ 2 , {\displaystyle \mu _{2},} δ δ 2 {\displaystyle \delta _{2}} , respectively, then X 1 + X 2 {\displaystyle X_{1}+X_{2}} is NIG-distributed with parameters α α , {\displaystyle \alpha ,} β β , {\displaystyle \beta ,} μ μ 1 + μ μ 2 {\displaystyle \mu _{1}+\mu _{2}} and δ δ 1 + δ δ 2 .

{\displaystyle \delta _{1}+\delta _{2}.} Related distributions [ edit ] The class of NIG distributions is a flexible system of distributions that includes fat-tailed and skewed distributions, and the normal distribution , N ( μ μ , σ σ 2 ) , {\displaystyle N(\mu ,\sigma ^{2}),} arises as a special case by setting β β = 0 , δ δ = σ σ 2 α α , {\displaystyle \beta =0,\delta =\sigma ^{2}\alpha ,} and letting α α → → ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \alpha \rightarrow \infty } .

Stochastic process [ edit ] The normal-inverse Gaussian distribution can also be seen as the marginal distribution of the normal-inverse Gaussian process which provides an alternative way of explicitly constructing it. Starting with a drifting Brownian motion ( Wiener process ), W ( γ γ ) ( t ) = W ( t ) + γ γ t {\displaystyle W^{(\gamma )}(t)=W(t)+\gamma t} , we can define the inverse Gaussian process A t = inf { s > 0 : W ( γ γ ) ( s ) = δ δ t } .

{\displaystyle A_{t}=\inf\{s>0:W^{(\gamma )}(s)=\delta t\}.} Then given a second independent drifting Brownian motion, W ( β β ) ( t ) = W ~ ~ ( t ) + β β t {\displaystyle W^{(\beta )}(t)={\tilde {W}}(t)+\beta t} , the normal-inverse Gaussian process is the time-changed process X t = W ( β β ) ( A t ) {\displaystyle X_{t}=W^{(\beta )}(A_{t})} . The process X ( t ) {\displaystyle X(t)} at time t = 1 {\displaystyle t=1} has the normal-inverse Gaussian distribution described above. The NIG process is a particular instance of the more general class of Lévy processes .

As a variance-mean mixture [ edit ] Let I G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {IG}}} denote the inverse Gaussian distribution and N {\displaystyle {\mathcal {N}}} denote the normal distribution . Let z ∼ ∼ I G ( δ δ , γ γ ) {\displaystyle z\sim {\mathcal {IG}}(\delta ,\gamma )} , where γ γ = α α 2 − − β β 2 {\displaystyle \gamma ={\sqrt {\alpha ^{2}-\beta ^{2}}}} ; and let x ∼ ∼ N ( μ μ + β β z , z ) {\displaystyle x\sim {\mathcal {N}}(\mu +\beta z,z)} , then x {\displaystyle x} follows the NIG distribution, with parameters, α α , β β , δ δ , μ μ {\displaystyle \alpha ,\beta ,\delta ,\mu } . This can be used to generate NIG variates by ancestral sampling . It can also be used to derive an EM algorithm for maximum-likelihood estimation of the NIG parameters.
