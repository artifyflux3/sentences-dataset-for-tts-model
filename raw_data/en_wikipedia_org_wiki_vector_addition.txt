A vector ![Image 2: {\textstyle {\stackrel {\rightarrow }{a}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f4f4ea0d3b10bf904d7b9ef1c5ae6d8250052b82) pointing from point _A_ to point _B_

In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics"), and [engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering "Engineering"), a **Euclidean vector** or simply a **vector** (sometimes called a **geometric vector**[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_addition#cite_note-1) or **spatial vector**[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_addition#cite_note-2)) is a geometric object that has [magnitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnitude_(mathematics) "Magnitude (mathematics)") (or [length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_norm "Euclidean norm")) and [direction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direction_(geometry) "Direction (geometry)"). Euclidean vectors can be added and scaled to form a [vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space"). A _[vector quantity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector\_quantity "Vector quantity")_ is a vector-valued [physical quantity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_quantity "Physical quantity"), including [units of measurement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement "Units of measurement") and possibly a [support](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_(mathematics) "Support (mathematics)"), formulated as a _[directed line segment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed\_line\_segment "Directed line segment")_. A vector is frequently depicted graphically as an arrow connecting an _initial point_ _A_ with a _terminal point_ _B_,[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_addition#cite_note-3) and denoted by ![Image 3: {\textstyle {\stackrel {\longrightarrow }{AB}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1685a314ff2cd5e06977ddfa3475af7e0f8da120)

A vector is what is needed to "carry" the point _A_ to the point _B_; the Latin word _vector_ means 'carrier'.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_addition#cite_note-4) It was first used by 18th century [astronomers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomers "Astronomers") investigating planetary revolution around the Sun.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_addition#cite_note-5) The magnitude of the vector is the distance between the two points, and the direction refers to the direction of [displacement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_(geometry) "Displacement (geometry)") from _A_ to _B_. Many [algebraic operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_operation "Algebraic operation") on [real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number") such as [addition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition "Addition"), [subtraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtraction "Subtraction"), [multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication "Multiplication"), and [negation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_inverse "Additive inverse") have close analogues for vectors,[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_addition#cite_note-:1-6) operations which obey the familiar algebraic laws of [commutativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutativity "Commutativity"), [associativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associativity "Associativity"), and [distributivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributivity "Distributivity"). These operations and associated laws qualify [Euclidean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space") vectors as an example of the more generalized concept of vectors defined simply as elements of a [vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space").

Vectors play an important role in [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics"): the [velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity "Velocity") and [acceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration "Acceleration") of a moving object and the [forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force "Force") acting on it can all be described with vectors.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_addition#cite_note-:2-7) Many other physical quantities can be usefully thought of as vectors. Although most of them do not represent distances (except, for example, [position](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position_(vector) "Position (vector)") or [displacement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_(vector) "Displacement (vector)")), their magnitude and direction can still be represented by the length and direction of an arrow. The mathematical representation of a physical vector depends on the [coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_system "Coordinate system") used to describe it. Other vector-like objects that describe [physical quantities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_quantities "Physical quantities") and transform in a similar way under changes of the coordinate system include [pseudovectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudovector "Pseudovector") and [tensors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor "Tensor").[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_addition#cite_note-8)

The vector concept, as it is known today, is the result of a gradual development over a period of more than 200 years. About a dozen people contributed significantly to its development.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_addition#cite_note-Crowe-9) In 1835, [Giusto Bellavitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giusto_Bellavitis "Giusto Bellavitis") abstracted the basic idea when he established the concept of [equipollence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equipollence_(geometry) "Equipollence (geometry)"). Working in a Euclidean plane, he made equipollent any pair of [parallel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_(geometry) "Parallel (geometry)") line segments of the same length and orientation. Essentially, he realized an [equivalence relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_relation "Equivalence relation") on the pairs of points (bipoints) in the plane, and thus erected the first space of vectors in the plane.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_addition#cite_note-Crowe-9): 52–4  The term _vector_ was introduced by [William Rowan Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton "William Rowan Hamilton") as part of a [quaternion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion "Quaternion"), which is a sum _q_ = _s_ + _v_ of a [real number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number")_s_ (also called _scalar_) and a 3-dimensional _vector_. Like Bellavitis, Hamilton viewed vectors as representative of [classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_class "Equivalence class") of equipollent directed segments. As [complex numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number "Complex number") use an [imaginary unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaginary_unit "Imaginary unit") to complement the [real line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_line "Real line"), Hamilton considered the vector _v_ to be the _imaginary part_ of a quaternion:[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_addition#cite_note-10)

> The algebraically imaginary part, being geometrically constructed by a straight line, or radius vector, which has, in general, for each determined quaternion, a determined length and determined direction in space, may be called the vector part, or simply the vector of the quaternion.

Several other mathematicians developed vector-like systems in the middle of the nineteenth century, including [Augustin Cauchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustin_Cauchy "Augustin Cauchy"), [Hermann Grassmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Grassmann "Hermann Grassmann"), [August Möbius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_M%C3%B6bius "August Möbius"), [Comte de Saint-Venant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comte_de_Saint-Venant "Comte de Saint-Venant"), and [Matthew O'Brien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_O%27Brien_(mathematician) "Matthew O'Brien (mathematician)"). Grassmann's 1840 work _Theorie der Ebbe und Flut_ (Theory of the Ebb and Flow) was the first system of spatial analysis that is similar to today's system, and had ideas corresponding to the cross product, scalar product and vector differentiation. Grassmann's work was largely neglected until the 1870s.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_addition#cite_note-Crowe-9)[Peter Guthrie Tait](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Guthrie_Tait "Peter Guthrie Tait") carried the quaternion standard after Hamilton. His 1867 _Elementary Treatise of Quaternions_ included extensive treatment of the nabla or [del operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Del "Del") ∇. In 1878, _[Elements of Dynamic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elements\_of\_Dynamic "Elements of Dynamic")_ was published by [William Kingdon Clifford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Kingdon_Clifford "William Kingdon Clifford"). Clifford simplified the quaternion study by isolating the [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product "Dot product") and [cross product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_product "Cross product") of two vectors from the complete quaternion product. This approach made vector calculations available to engineers—and others working in three dimensions and skeptical of the fourth.

[Josiah Willard Gibbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josiah_Willard_Gibbs "Josiah Willard Gibbs"), who was exposed to quaternions through [James Clerk Maxwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell "James Clerk Maxwell")'s _Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism_, separated off their vector part for independent treatment. The first half of Gibbs's _Elements of Vector Analysis_, published in 1881, presents what is essentially the modern system of vector analysis.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_addition#cite_note-Crowe-9)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_addition#cite_note-:1-6) In 1901, [Edwin Bidwell Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Bidwell_Wilson "Edwin Bidwell Wilson") published _[Vector Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector\_Analysis "Vector Analysis")_, adapted from Gibbs's lectures, which banished any mention of quaternions in the development of vector calculus.

In [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics") and [engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering "Engineering"), a vector is typically regarded as a geometric entity characterized by a [magnitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnitude_(mathematics) "Magnitude (mathematics)") and a [relative direction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_direction "Relative direction"). It is formally defined as a [directed line segment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_line_segment "Directed line segment"), or arrow, in a [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space").[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_addition#cite_note-11) In [pure mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_mathematics "Pure mathematics"), a [vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(mathematics) "Vector (mathematics)") is defined more generally as any element of a [vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space"). In this context, vectors are abstract entities which may or may not be characterized by a magnitude and a direction. This generalized definition implies that the above-mentioned geometric entities are a special kind of abstract vectors, as they are elements of a special kind of vector space called [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space"). This particular article is about vectors strictly defined as arrows in Euclidean space. When it becomes necessary to distinguish these special vectors from vectors as defined in pure mathematics, they are sometimes referred to as _**geometric**_, _**spatial**_, or _**Euclidean**_ vectors.

A Euclidean vector may possess a definite _initial point_ and _terminal point_; such a condition may be emphasized calling the result a _**bound vector**_.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_addition#cite_note-12) When only the magnitude and direction of the vector matter, and the particular initial or terminal points are of no importance, the vector is called a _**free vector**_. The distinction between bound and free vectors is especially relevant in mechanics, where a [force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force "Force") applied to a body has a point of contact (see [resultant force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resultant_force "Resultant force") and [couple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Couple_(mechanics) "Couple (mechanics)")).

Two arrows ![Image 4: {\displaystyle {\stackrel {\,\longrightarrow }{AB}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2179c2609a938b5de1169073fc640e951d75055e) and ![Image 5: {\displaystyle {\stackrel {\,\longrightarrow }{A'B'}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8ac8509a59a3dda4c0bc75836afe7b7b42994d0b) in space represent the same free vector if they have the same magnitude and direction: that is, they are [equipollent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equipollence_(geometry) "Equipollence (geometry)") if the quadrilateral _ABB′A′_ is a [parallelogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallelogram "Parallelogram"). If the Euclidean space is equipped with a choice of [origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_(mathematics) "Origin (mathematics)"), then a free vector is equivalent to the bound vector of the same magnitude and direction whose initial point is the origin.

The term _vector_ also has generalizations to higher dimensions, and to more formal approaches with much wider applications.

### Further information

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Euclidean_vector&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Further information")]

In classical [Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry "Euclidean geometry") (i.e., [synthetic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_geometry "Synthetic geometry")), vectors were introduced (during the 19th century) as [equivalence classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_class "Equivalence class") under [equipollence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equipollence_(geometry) "Equipollence (geometry)"), of [ordered pairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_pair "Ordered pair") of points; two pairs (_A_, _B_) and (_C_, _D_) being equipollent if the points _A_, _B_, _D_, _C_, in this order, form a [parallelogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallelogram "Parallelogram"). Such an equivalence class is called a _vector_, more precisely, a Euclidean vector.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_addition#cite_note-13) The equivalence class of (_A_, _B_) is often denoted ![Image 6: {\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {AB}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6c6456460139935ea147f2f27e5f3c406584eab2)

A Euclidean vector is thus an equivalence class of directed segments with the same magnitude (e.g., the length of the [line segment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_segment "Line segment")(_A_, _B_)) and same direction (e.g., the direction from A to B).[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_addition#cite_note-1.1:_Vectors-14) In physics, Euclidean vectors are used to represent physical quantities that have both magnitude and direction, but are not located at a specific place, in contrast to [scalars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_(mathematics) "Scalar (mathematics)"), which have no direction.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_addition#cite_note-:2-7) For example, [velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity "Velocity"), [forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force "Force") and [acceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration "Acceleration") are represented by vectors.

In modern geometry, Euclidean spaces are often defined from [linear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra "Linear algebra"). More precisely, a Euclidean space E is defined as a set to which is associated an [inner product space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_product_space "Inner product space") of finite dimension over the reals ![Image 7: {\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {E}},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5bc2d2ae2efe2b4092a3b8feac33a91c240943fa) and a [group action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_action_(mathematics) "Group action (mathematics)") of the [additive group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_group "Additive group") of ![Image 8: {\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {E}},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5bc2d2ae2efe2b4092a3b8feac33a91c240943fa) which is [free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_action "Free action") and [transitive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitive_action "Transitive action") (See [Affine space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_space "Affine space") for details of this construction). The elements of ![Image 9: {\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {E}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5d664d9d5a70d17f42f3b274eb2e79037cf3bcae) are called [translations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(geometry) "Translation (geometry)"). It has been proven that the two definitions of Euclidean spaces are equivalent, and that the equivalence classes under equipollence may be identified with translations.

Sometimes, Euclidean vectors are considered without reference to a Euclidean space. In this case, a Euclidean vector is an element of a normed vector space of finite dimension over the reals, or, typically, an element of the [real coordinate space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_coordinate_space "Real coordinate space")![Image 10: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c510b63578322050121fe966f2e5770bea43308d) equipped with the [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product "Dot product"). This makes sense, as the addition in such a vector space acts freely and transitively on the vector space itself. That is, ![Image 11: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c510b63578322050121fe966f2e5770bea43308d) is a Euclidean space, with itself as an associated vector space, and the dot product as an inner product.

The Euclidean space ![Image 12: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c510b63578322050121fe966f2e5770bea43308d) is often presented as _the_[standard Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Euclidean_space "Standard Euclidean space") of dimension n. This is motivated by the fact that every Euclidean space of dimension n is [isomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphism "Isomorphism") to the Euclidean space ![Image 13: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/76ef548febfc9981762740107858be9e3a5576c3) More precisely, given such a Euclidean space, one may choose any point O as an [origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_(geometry) "Origin (geometry)"). By [Gram–Schmidt process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram%E2%80%93Schmidt_process "Gram–Schmidt process"), one may also find an [orthonormal basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthonormal_basis "Orthonormal basis") of the associated vector space (a basis such that the inner product of two basis vectors is 0 if they are different and 1 if they are equal). This defines [Cartesian coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinates "Cartesian coordinates") of any point P of the space, as the coordinates on this basis of the vector ![Image 14: {\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {OP}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/046b84f7e442fc1a9e43ec90a06c900c8897040d) These choices define an isomorphism of the given Euclidean space onto ![Image 15: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d7035fcb9fe3ebecc6bc9f372f82d0352202c8bf) by mapping any point to the [n-tuple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuple "Tuple") of its Cartesian coordinates, and every vector to its [coordinate vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_vector "Coordinate vector").

### Examples in one dimension

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Euclidean_vector&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Examples in one dimension")]

Since the physicist's concept of [force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_(physics) "Force (physics)") has a direction and a magnitude, it may be seen as a vector. As an example, consider a rightward force _F_ of 15 [newtons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_(unit) "Newton (unit)"). If the positive [axis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system "Cartesian coordinate system") is also directed rightward, then _F_ is represented by the vector 15 N, and if positive points leftward, then the vector for _F_ is −15 N. In either case, the magnitude of the vector is 15 N. Likewise, the vector representation of a displacement Δ _s_ of 4 [meters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meter_(unit) "Meter (unit)") would be 4 m or −4 m, depending on its direction, and its magnitude would be 4 m regardless.

### In physics and engineering

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Euclidean_vector&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: In physics and engineering")]

Vectors are fundamental in the physical sciences. They can be used to represent any quantity that has magnitude, has direction, and which adheres to the rules of vector addition. An example is [velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity "Velocity"), the magnitude of which is [speed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed "Speed"). For instance, the velocity _5 meters per second upward_ could be represented by the vector (0, 5) (in 2 dimensions with the positive _y_-axis as 'up'). Another quantity represented by a vector is [force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force "Force"), since it has a magnitude and direction and follows the rules of vector addition.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_addition#cite_note-:2-7) Vectors also describe many other physical quantities, such as linear displacement, [displacement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_(vector) "Displacement (vector)"), linear acceleration, [angular acceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_acceleration "Angular acceleration"), [linear momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_momentum "Linear momentum"), and [angular momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_momentum "Angular momentum"). Other physical vectors, such as the [electric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_field "Electric field") and [magnetic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field "Magnetic field"), are represented as a system of vectors at each point of a physical space; that is, a [vector field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_field "Vector field"). Examples of quantities that have magnitude and direction, but fail to follow the rules of vector addition, are angular displacement and electric current. Consequently, these are not vectors.

In the [Cartesian coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system "Cartesian coordinate system"), a bound vector can be represented by identifying the coordinates of its initial and terminal point. For instance, the points _A_ = (1, 0, 0) and _B_ = (0, 1, 0) in space determine the bound vector ![Image 16: {\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {AB}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b245e60e48c3c8f577aaf9512a1bdf3049cc6207) pointing from the point _x_ = 1 on the _x_-axis to the point _y_ = 1 on the _y_-axis.

In Cartesian coordinates, a free vector may be thought of in terms of a corresponding bound vector, in this sense, whose initial point has the coordinates of the origin _O_ = (0, 0, 0). It is then determined by the coordinates of that bound vector's terminal point. Thus the free vector represented by (1, 0, 0) is a vector of unit length—pointing along the direction of the positive _x_-axis.

This coordinate representation of free vectors allows their algebraic features to be expressed in a convenient numerical fashion. For example, the sum of the two (free) vectors (1, 2, 3) and (−2, 0, 4) is the (free) vector ![Image 17: {\displaystyle (1,2,3)+(-2,0,4)=(1-2,2+0,3+4)=(-1,2,7)\,.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/395f67c1c338c7aa8c27e074664e25e3e8684260)

### Euclidean and affine vectors

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Euclidean_vector&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Euclidean and affine vectors")]

In the geometrical and physical settings, it is sometimes possible to associate, in a natural way, a _length_ or magnitude and a direction to vectors. In addition, the notion of direction is strictly associated with the notion of an _angle_ between two vectors. If the [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product "Dot product") of two vectors is defined—a scalar-valued product of two vectors—then it is also possible to define a length; the dot product gives a convenient algebraic characterization of both angle (a function of the dot product between any two non-zero vectors) and length (the square root of the dot product of a vector by itself). In three dimensions, it is further possible to define the [cross product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_product "Cross product"), which supplies an algebraic characterization of the [area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area "Area") and [orientation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientation_(geometry) "Orientation (geometry)") in space of the [parallelogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallelogram "Parallelogram") defined by two vectors (used as sides of the parallelogram). In any dimension (and, in particular, higher dimensions), it is possible to define the [exterior product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exterior_product "Exterior product"), which (among other things) supplies an algebraic characterization of the area and orientation in space of the _n_-dimensional [parallelotope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallelepiped#Parallelotope "Parallelepiped") defined by _n_ vectors.

In a [pseudo-Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo-Euclidean_space "Pseudo-Euclidean space"), a vector's squared length can be positive, negative, or zero. An important example is [Minkowski space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_space "Minkowski space") (which is important to our understanding of [special relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity "Special relativity")).

However, it is not always possible or desirable to define the length of a vector. This more general type of spatial vector is the subject of [vector spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space") (for free vectors) and [affine spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_space "Affine space") (for bound vectors, as each represented by an ordered pair of "points"). One physical example comes from [thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamics "Thermodynamics"), where many quantities of interest can be considered vectors in a space with no notion of length or angle.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_addition#cite_note-thermo-forms-15)

In physics, as well as mathematics, a vector is often identified with a [tuple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuple "Tuple") of components, or list of numbers, that act as scalar coefficients for a set of [basis vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_vector "Basis vector"). When the basis is transformed, for example by rotation or stretching, then the components of any vector in terms of that basis also transform in an opposite sense. The vector itself has not changed, but the basis has, so the components of the vector must change to compensate. The vector is called _covariant_ or _contravariant_, depending on how the transformation of the vector's components is related to the transformation of the basis. In general, contravariant vectors are "regular vectors" with units of distance (such as a displacement), or distance times some other unit (such as velocity or acceleration); covariant vectors, on the other hand, have units of one-over-distance such as [gradient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient "Gradient"). If you change units (a special case of a [change of basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_of_basis "Change of basis")) from meters to millimeters, a scale factor of 1/1000, a displacement of 1 m becomes 1000 mm—a contravariant change in numerical value. In contrast, a gradient of 1[K](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin "Kelvin")/m becomes 0.001 K/mm—a covariant change in value (for more, see [covariance and contravariance of vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_and_contravariance_of_vectors "Covariance and contravariance of vectors")). [Tensors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor "Tensor") are another type of quantity that behave in this way; a vector is one type of [tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor "Tensor").

In pure [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), a vector is any element of a [vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space") over some [field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics) "Field (mathematics)") and is often represented as a [coordinate vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_vector "Coordinate vector"). The vectors described in this article are a very special case of this general definition, because they are contravariant with respect to the ambient space. Contravariance captures the physical intuition behind the idea that a vector has "magnitude and direction".

Vector arrow pointing from _A_ to _B_

Vectors are usually denoted in [lowercase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowercase "Lowercase") boldface, as in ![Image 19: {\displaystyle \mathbf {u} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/261e20fe101de02a771021d9d4466c0ad3e352d7)**, ![Image 20: {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/35c1866e359fbfd2e0f606c725ba5cc37a5195d6)** and ![Image 21: {\displaystyle \mathbf {w} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/20795664b5b048744a2fd88977851104cc5816f8), or in lowercase italic boldface, as in _**a**_. ([Uppercase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uppercase "Uppercase") letters are typically used to represent [matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics) "Matrix (mathematics)").) Other conventions include ![Image 22: {\displaystyle {\vec {a}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/546e6615827e17295718741fd0b86f639a947f16) or _a_, especially in handwriting. Alternatively, some use a [tilde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilde "Tilde") (~) or a wavy underline drawn beneath the symbol, e.g. ![Image 23: {\displaystyle {\underset {^{\sim }}{a}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6e6b9a3a6bfaeccd24d9e4c2c6a4a47d1daba994), which is a convention for indicating boldface type. If the vector represents a directed [distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance "Distance") or [displacement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_(vector) "Displacement (vector)") from a point _A_ to a point _B_ (see figure), it can also be denoted as ![Image 24: {\displaystyle {\stackrel {\longrightarrow }{AB}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2a7763711eb7a45cb0644b415e054d5d352fea9c) or _AB_. In [German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language "German language") literature, it was especially common to represent vectors with small [fraktur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraktur "Fraktur") letters such as ![Image 25: {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {a}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/16f656feeddb5d98500bb4d3fc31038d0b87484b).

Vectors are usually shown in graphs or other diagrams as arrows (directed [line segments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_segment "Line segment")), as illustrated in the figure. Here, the point _A_ is called the _origin_, _tail_, _base_, or _initial point_, and the point _B_ is called the _head_, _tip_, _endpoint_, _terminal point_ or _final point_. The length of the arrow is proportional to the vector's [magnitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnitude_(mathematics) "Magnitude (mathematics)"), while the direction in which the arrow points indicates the vector's direction.

[![Image 26](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Notation_for_vectors_in_or_out_of_a_plane.svg/250px-Notation_for_vectors_in_or_out_of_a_plane.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Notation_for_vectors_in_or_out_of_a_plane.svg)

On a two-dimensional diagram, a vector [perpendicular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpendicular "Perpendicular") to the [plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(mathematics) "Plane (mathematics)") of the diagram is sometimes desired. These vectors are commonly shown as small circles. A circle with a dot at its centre (Unicode U+2299 ⊙) indicates a vector pointing out of the front of the diagram, toward the viewer. A circle with a cross inscribed in it (Unicode U+2297 ⊗) indicates a vector pointing into and behind the diagram. These can be thought of as viewing the tip of an [arrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow_(weapon) "Arrow (weapon)") head on and viewing the flights of an arrow from the back.

[![Image 27](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/Position_vector.svg/250px-Position_vector.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Position_vector.svg)

A vector in the Cartesian plane, showing the position of a point _A_ with coordinates (2, 3).

[![Image 28](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/3D_Vector.svg/330px-3D_Vector.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:3D_Vector.svg)

In order to calculate with vectors, the graphical representation may be too cumbersome. Vectors in an _n_-dimensional Euclidean space can be represented as [coordinate vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_vector "Coordinate vector") in a [Cartesian coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system "Cartesian coordinate system"). The endpoint of a vector can be identified with an ordered list of _n_ real numbers (_n_-[tuple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuple "Tuple")). These numbers are the [coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate "Cartesian coordinate") of the endpoint of the vector, with respect to a given [Cartesian coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system "Cartesian coordinate system"), and are typically called the _[scalar components](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar\_component "Scalar component")_ (or _scalar projections_) of the vector on the axes of the coordinate system.

As an example in two dimensions (see figure), the vector from the origin _O_ = (0, 0) to the point _A_ = (2, 3) is simply written as ![Image 29: {\displaystyle \mathbf {a} =(2,3).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5001e44c736b0318f2649daae132396a64161f8e)

The notion that the tail of the vector coincides with the origin is implicit and easily understood. Thus, the more explicit notation ![Image 30: {\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {OA}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/539359d530829a937dd5af1779649b4b64e8c315) is usually deemed not necessary (and is indeed rarely used).

In _three dimensional_ Euclidean space (or **R**3), vectors are identified with triples of scalar components: ![Image 31: {\displaystyle \mathbf {a} =(a_{1},a_{2},a_{3}).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c18784ddaa0173f5999217c41042ed4185e208c9) also written, ![Image 32: {\displaystyle \mathbf {a} =(a_{x},a_{y},a_{z}).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6df2fe880895742cd837fedea74ce84cb8b5a7c9)

This can be generalised to _n-dimensional_ Euclidean space (or **R**_n_). ![Image 33: {\displaystyle \mathbf {a} =(a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\cdots ,a_{n-1},a_{n}).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1aee2cc863741dd87bd21da529140dd2d1814a66)

These numbers are often arranged into a [column vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column_vector "Column vector") or [row vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row_vector "Row vector"), particularly when dealing with [matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics) "Matrix (mathematics)"), as follows: ![Image 34: {\displaystyle \mathbf {a} ={\begin{bmatrix}a_{1}\\a_{2}\\a_{3}\\\end{bmatrix}}=[a_{1}\ a_{2}\ a_{3}]^{\operatorname {T} }.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0a4d592431150c7ec8a51217d87dae2ed1224df2)

Another way to represent a vector in _n_-dimensions is to introduce the [standard basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_basis "Standard basis") vectors. For instance, in three dimensions, there are three of them: ![Image 35: {\displaystyle {\mathbf {e} }_{1}=(1,0,0),\ {\mathbf {e} }_{2}=(0,1,0),\ {\mathbf {e} }_{3}=(0,0,1).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/53cdade7939c4e4253dd603a282cec0382bc2478) These have the intuitive interpretation as vectors of unit length pointing up the _x_-, _y_-, and _z_-axis of a [Cartesian coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system "Cartesian coordinate system"), respectively. In terms of these, any vector **a** in **R**3 can be expressed in the form: ![Image 36: {\displaystyle \mathbf {a} =(a_{1},a_{2},a_{3})=a_{1}(1,0,0)+a_{2}(0,1,0)+a_{3}(0,0,1),\ }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/268dbb49eebf0c6e7c7dd045b2ffaaf747c34228)

or ![Image 37: {\displaystyle \mathbf {a} =\mathbf {a} _{1}+\mathbf {a} _{2}+\mathbf {a} _{3}=a_{1}{\mathbf {e} }_{1}+a_{2}{\mathbf {e} }_{2}+a_{3}{\mathbf {e} }_{3},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b3f2f7062ce588b0524ae0df3917fdc55edb0303)

where **a**1, **a**2, **a**3 are called the **[vector components](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_component "Vector component")** (or **vector projections**) of **a** on the basis vectors or, equivalently, on the corresponding Cartesian axes _x_, _y_, and _z_ (see figure), while _a_ 1, _a_ 2, _a_ 3 are the respective [scalar components](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_component "Scalar component") (or scalar projections).

In introductory physics textbooks, the standard basis vectors are often denoted ![Image 38: {\displaystyle \mathbf {i} ,\mathbf {j} ,\mathbf {k} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6d0ff20e01dd78f8f2149bcd2193013bd4aa8035) instead (or ![Image 39: {\displaystyle \mathbf {\hat {x}} ,\mathbf {\hat {y}} ,\mathbf {\hat {z}} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7b4bb94515ac2abba6ffb1834cbb612f5ac1c8cc), in which the [hat symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat_symbol "Hat symbol")![Image 40: {\displaystyle \mathbf {\hat {}} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7f14f8d3f0cad618cfbc607ffbc6a3ce4c0b04c2) typically denotes [unit vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_vector "Unit vector")). In this case, the scalar and vector components are denoted respectively _a x_, _a y_, _a z_, and **a**_x_, **a**_y_, **a**_z_ (note the difference in boldface). Thus,

![Image 41: {\displaystyle \mathbf {a} =\mathbf {a} _{x}+\mathbf {a} _{y}+\mathbf {a} _{z}=a_{x}{\mathbf {i} }+a_{y}{\mathbf {j} }+a_{z}{\mathbf {k} }.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ba5af3348216e4fc1a4780df716905ae87fe664b)

The notation **e**_i_ is compatible with the [index notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_notation "Index notation") and the [summation convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summation_convention "Summation convention") commonly used in higher level mathematics, physics, and engineering.

### Decomposition or resolution

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Euclidean_vector&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Decomposition or resolution")]

As explained [above](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_addition#Representations), a vector is often described by a set of vector components that [add up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_addition#Addition_and_subtraction) to form the given vector. Typically, these components are the [projections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_projection "Vector projection") of the vector on a set of mutually perpendicular reference axes (basis vectors). The vector is said to be _decomposed_ or _resolved with respect to_ that set.

[![Image 42](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Surface_normal_tangent.svg/250px-Surface_normal_tangent.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Surface_normal_tangent.svg)

Illustration of tangential and normal components of a vector to a surface.

The decomposition or resolution[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_addition#cite_note-16) of a vector into components is not unique, because it depends on the choice of the axes on which the vector is projected.

Moreover, the use of Cartesian unit vectors such as ![Image 43: {\displaystyle \mathbf {\hat {x}} ,\mathbf {\hat {y}} ,\mathbf {\hat {z}} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7b4bb94515ac2abba6ffb1834cbb612f5ac1c8cc) as a [basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_(linear_algebra) "Basis (linear algebra)") in which to represent a vector is not mandated. Vectors can also be expressed in terms of an arbitrary basis, including the unit vectors of a [cylindrical coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylindrical_coordinate_system "Cylindrical coordinate system") (![Image 44: {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\hat {\rho }}},{\boldsymbol {\hat {\phi }}},\mathbf {\hat {z}} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fbbbc1a17868784aee9302ab09c31546fab97fc5)) or [spherical coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_coordinate_system "Spherical coordinate system") (![Image 45: {\displaystyle \mathbf {\hat {r}} ,{\boldsymbol {\hat {\theta }}},{\boldsymbol {\hat {\phi }}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/970a17c6353d2f80eac9f031defd481dcad9f328)). The latter two choices are more convenient for solving problems which possess cylindrical or spherical symmetry, respectively.

The choice of a basis does not affect the properties of a vector or its behaviour under transformations.

A vector can also be broken up with respect to "non-fixed" basis vectors that change their [orientation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientation_(geometry) "Orientation (geometry)") as a function of time or space. For example, a vector in three-dimensional space can be decomposed with respect to two axes, respectively _normal_, and _tangent_ to a surface (see figure). Moreover, the _radial_ and _[tangential components](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangential\_component "Tangential component")_ of a vector relate to the _[radius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radius "Radius") of [rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation "Rotation")_ of an object. The former is [parallel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_(geometry) "Parallel (geometry)") to the radius and the latter is [orthogonal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpendicular "Perpendicular") to it.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_addition#cite_note-17)

In these cases, each of the components may be in turn decomposed with respect to a fixed coordinate system or basis set (e.g., a _global_ coordinate system, or [inertial reference frame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_reference_frame "Inertial reference frame")).

Properties and operations
-------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Euclidean_vector&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Properties and operations")]

The following section uses the [Cartesian coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system "Cartesian coordinate system") with basis vectors ![Image 46: {\displaystyle {\mathbf {e} }_{1}=(1,0,0),\ {\mathbf {e} }_{2}=(0,1,0),\ {\mathbf {e} }_{3}=(0,0,1)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7d77f8f673c1e19acc6cccfe93fcef18dfcfec24) and assumes that all vectors have the origin as a common base point. A vector **a** will be written as ![Image 47: {\displaystyle {\mathbf {a} }=a_{1}{\mathbf {e} }_{1}+a_{2}{\mathbf {e} }_{2}+a_{3}{\mathbf {e} }_{3}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b08e072138a1b57a0e67d7dd81d4af72c627bb14)

Two vectors are said to be equal if they have the same magnitude and direction. Equivalently they will be equal if their coordinates are equal. So two vectors ![Image 48: {\displaystyle {\mathbf {a} }=a_{1}{\mathbf {e} }_{1}+a_{2}{\mathbf {e} }_{2}+a_{3}{\mathbf {e} }_{3}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/571d07f851ee25f218183363b7fec7266dfdf2fa) and ![Image 49: {\displaystyle {\mathbf {b} }=b_{1}{\mathbf {e} }_{1}+b_{2}{\mathbf {e} }_{2}+b_{3}{\mathbf {e} }_{3}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/46acc2a3f76856b4d526262d5eb74f023ef4cc79) are equal if ![Image 50: {\displaystyle a_{1}=b_{1},\quad a_{2}=b_{2},\quad a_{3}=b_{3}.\,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6f1d6d86c8b6e7368ef58bdbda9d37ce5e80421e)

### Opposite, parallel, and antiparallel vectors

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Euclidean_vector&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Opposite, parallel, and antiparallel vectors")]

Two vectors are _opposite_ if they have the same magnitude but [opposite direction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposite_direction_(geometry) "Opposite direction (geometry)");[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_addition#cite_note-HMCS-18) so two vectors

![Image 51: {\displaystyle {\mathbf {a} }=a_{1}{\mathbf {e} }_{1}+a_{2}{\mathbf {e} }_{2}+a_{3}{\mathbf {e} }_{3}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/571d07f851ee25f218183363b7fec7266dfdf2fa)

and

![Image 52: {\displaystyle {\mathbf {b} }=b_{1}{\mathbf {e} }_{1}+b_{2}{\mathbf {e} }_{2}+b_{3}{\mathbf {e} }_{3}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/46acc2a3f76856b4d526262d5eb74f023ef4cc79)

are opposite if

![Image 53: {\displaystyle a_{1}=-b_{1},\quad a_{2}=-b_{2},\quad a_{3}=-b_{3}.\,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/46645191ae5f74b974be506f04eebc83fbdb5456)

Two vectors are _[equidirectional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equidirectional "Equidirectional")_ (or _codirectional_) if they have the same direction but not necessarily the same magnitude.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_addition#cite_note-HMCS-18) Two vectors are _parallel_ if they have either the same or opposite direction, but not necessarily the same magnitude; two vectors are _antiparallel_ if they have strictly opposite direction, but not necessarily the same magnitude.[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_addition#cite_note-19)

### Addition and subtraction

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Euclidean_vector&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Addition and subtraction")]

The sum of **a** and **b** of two vectors may be defined as ![Image 54: {\displaystyle \mathbf {a} +\mathbf {b} =(a_{1}+b_{1})\mathbf {e} _{1}+(a_{2}+b_{2})\mathbf {e} _{2}+(a_{3}+b_{3})\mathbf {e} _{3}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a3682ea299d3f0678c45b23ac9c850c30221a502) The resulting vector is sometimes called the **resultant vector** of **a** and **b**.

The addition may be represented graphically by placing the tail of the arrow **b** at the head of the arrow **a**, and then drawing an arrow from the tail of **a** to the head of **b**. The new arrow drawn represents the vector **a** + **b**, as illustrated below:[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_addition#cite_note-:2-7)

[![Image 55: The addition of two vectors a and b](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/Vector_addition.svg/250px-Vector_addition.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Vector_addition.svg "The addition of two vectors a and b")

The addition of two vectors **a** and **b**

This addition method is sometimes called the _parallelogram rule_ because **a** and **b** form the sides of a [parallelogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallelogram "Parallelogram") and **a** + **b** is one of the diagonals. If **a** and **b** are bound vectors that have the same base point, this point will also be the base point of **a** + **b**. One can check geometrically that **a** + **b** = **b** + **a** and (**a** + **b**) + **c** = **a** + (**b** + **c**).

The difference of **a** and **b** is

![Image 56: {\displaystyle \mathbf {a} -\mathbf {b} =(a_{1}-b_{1})\mathbf {e} _{1}+(a_{2}-b_{2})\mathbf {e} _{2}+(a_{3}-b_{3})\mathbf {e} _{3}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3bb76515e11d90d5c929eccdc1185530a18d6fee)

Subtraction of two vectors can be geometrically illustrated as follows: to subtract **b** from **a**, place the tails of **a** and **b** at the same point, and then draw an arrow from the head of **b** to the head of **a**. This new arrow represents the vector **(-b)** + **a**, with **(-b)** being the opposite of **b**, see drawing. And **(-b)** + **a** = **a** − **b**.

[![Image 57: The subtraction of two vectors a and b](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/Vector_subtraction.svg/125px-Vector_subtraction.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Vector_subtraction.svg "The subtraction of two vectors a and b")

The subtraction of two vectors **a** and **b**

### Scalar multiplication

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Euclidean_vector&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Scalar multiplication")]

[![Image 58](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Scalar_multiplication_by_r%3D3.svg/250px-Scalar_multiplication_by_r%3D3.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Scalar_multiplication_by_r%3D3.svg)

Scalar multiplication of a vector by a factor of 3 stretches the vector out.

A vector may also be multiplied, or re-_scaled_, by any [real number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number")_r_. In the context of [conventional vector algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_analysis "Vector analysis"), these real numbers are often called **scalars** (from _scale_) to distinguish them from vectors. The operation of multiplying a vector by a scalar is called _scalar multiplication_. The resulting vector is

![Image 59: {\displaystyle r\mathbf {a} =(ra_{1})\mathbf {e} _{1}+(ra_{2})\mathbf {e} _{2}+(ra_{3})\mathbf {e} _{3}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4a6af27c3cb5dbb6d4a2d3a24156647daf72b9cd)

Intuitively, multiplying by a scalar _r_ stretches a vector out by a factor of _r_. Geometrically, this can be visualized (at least in the case when _r_ is an integer) as placing _r_ copies of the vector in a line where the endpoint of one vector is the initial point of the next vector.

If _r_ is negative, then the vector changes direction: it flips around by an angle of 180°. Two examples (_r_ = −1 and _r_ = 2) are given below:

[![Image 60](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Scalar_multiplication_of_vectors2.svg/250px-Scalar_multiplication_of_vectors2.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Scalar_multiplication_of_vectors2.svg)

The scalar multiplications −**a** and 2**a** of a vector **a**

Scalar multiplication is [distributive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributivity "Distributivity") over vector addition in the following sense: _r_(**a** + **b**) = _r_**a** + _r_**b** for all vectors **a** and **b** and all scalars _r_. One can also show that **a** − **b** = **a** + (−1)**b**.

The _[length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length "Length")_, _[magnitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnitude\_(mathematics) "Magnitude (mathematics)")_ or _[norm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm\_(mathematics) "Norm (mathematics)")_ of the vector **a** is denoted by ‖**a**‖ or, less commonly, |**a**|, which is not to be confused with the [absolute value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_value "Absolute value") (a scalar "norm").

The length of the vector **a** can be computed with the _[Euclidean norm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean\_norm "Euclidean norm")_,

![Image 61: {\displaystyle \left\|\mathbf {a} \right\|={\sqrt {a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+a_{3}^{2}}},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2686039adcb3b7ba6cc03dee2af6d9844ac8ab08)

which is a consequence of the [Pythagorean theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem "Pythagorean theorem") since the basis vectors **e**1, **e**2, **e**3 are orthogonal unit vectors.

This happens to be equal to the square root of the [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product "Dot product"), discussed below, of the vector with itself:

![Image 62: {\displaystyle \left\|\mathbf {a} \right\|={\sqrt {\mathbf {a} \cdot \mathbf {a} }}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7c4cb3ee58fb36ab48d1a8f195b51f50b830b899)

[![Image 63](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/Vector_normalization.svg/250px-Vector_normalization.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Vector_normalization.svg)

The normalization of a vector **a** into a unit vector **â**

A _unit vector_ is any vector with a length of one; normally unit vectors are used simply to indicate direction. A vector of arbitrary length can be divided by its length to create a unit vector.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_addition#cite_note-1.1:_Vectors-14) This is known as _normalizing_ a vector. A unit vector is often indicated with a hat as in **â**.

To normalize a vector **a** = (_a_ 1, _a_ 2, _a_ 3), scale the vector by the reciprocal of its length ‖**a**‖. That is:

![Image 64: {\displaystyle \mathbf {\hat {a}} ={\frac {\mathbf {a} }{\left\|\mathbf {a} \right\|}}={\frac {a_{1}}{\left\|\mathbf {a} \right\|}}\mathbf {e} _{1}+{\frac {a_{2}}{\left\|\mathbf {a} \right\|}}\mathbf {e} _{2}+{\frac {a_{3}}{\left\|\mathbf {a} \right\|}}\mathbf {e} _{3}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/62a68ef5514253b0c663439482c0559a5f8654c1)

The _zero vector_ is the vector with length zero. Written out in coordinates, the vector is (0, 0, 0), and it is commonly denoted ![Image 65: {\displaystyle {\vec {0}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e76498919cf387316fc79d04120c59a8d430ef36), **0**, or simply 0. Unlike any other vector, it has an arbitrary or indeterminate direction, and cannot be normalized (that is, there is no unit vector that is a multiple of the zero vector). The sum of the zero vector with any vector **a** is **a** (that is, **0** + **a** = **a**).

The _dot product_ of two vectors **a** and **b** (sometimes called the _[inner product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner\_product\_space "Inner product space")_, or, since its result is a scalar, the _scalar product_) is denoted by **a**∙**b,** and is defined as:

![Image 66: {\displaystyle \mathbf {a} \cdot \mathbf {b} =\left\|\mathbf {a} \right\|\left\|\mathbf {b} \right\|\cos \theta ,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2ed1f590c477f4f86793ed25a3f20c3633f742ee)

where _θ_ is the measure of the [angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle "Angle") between **a** and **b** (see [trigonometric function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometric_function "Trigonometric function") for an explanation of cosine). Geometrically, this means that **a** and **b** are drawn with a common start point, and then the length of **a** is multiplied with the length of the component of **b** that points in the same direction as **a**.

The dot product can also be defined as the sum of the products of the components of each vector as

![Image 67: {\displaystyle \mathbf {a} \cdot \mathbf {b} =a_{1}b_{1}+a_{2}b_{2}+a_{3}b_{3}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/44ce07b770fcc78bba136f6d7386d8255dfdc24a)

The _cross product_ (also called the _vector product_ or _outer product_) is only meaningful in three or [seven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven-dimensional_cross_product "Seven-dimensional cross product") dimensions. The cross product differs from the dot product primarily in that the result of the cross product of two vectors is a vector. The cross product, denoted **a**×**b**, is a vector perpendicular to both **a** and **b** and is defined as

![Image 68: {\displaystyle \mathbf {a} \times \mathbf {b} =\left\|\mathbf {a} \right\|\left\|\mathbf {b} \right\|\sin(\theta )\,\mathbf {n} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e5f960bc321540bc12366effa5a23ef5b5839c00)

where _θ_ is the measure of the angle between **a** and **b**, and **n** is a unit vector [perpendicular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpendicular "Perpendicular") to both **a** and **b** which completes a [right-handed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-hand_rule "Right-hand rule") system. The right-handedness constraint is necessary because there exist _two_ unit vectors that are perpendicular to both **a** and **b**, namely, **n** and (−**n**).

[![Image 69](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Cross_product_vector.svg/250px-Cross_product_vector.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cross_product_vector.svg)

An illustration of the cross product

The cross product **a**×**b** is defined so that **a**, **b**, and **a**×**b** also becomes a right-handed system (although **a** and **b** are not necessarily [orthogonal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal "Orthogonal")). This is the [right-hand rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-hand_rule "Right-hand rule").

The length of **a**×**b** can be interpreted as the area of the parallelogram having **a** and **b** as sides.

The cross product can be written as ![Image 70: {\displaystyle {\mathbf {a} }\times {\mathbf {b} }=(a_{2}b_{3}-a_{3}b_{2}){\mathbf {e} }_{1}+(a_{3}b_{1}-a_{1}b_{3}){\mathbf {e} }_{2}+(a_{1}b_{2}-a_{2}b_{1}){\mathbf {e} }_{3}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ce12e7e392236285ffa70787e1a32ba02eb46477)

For arbitrary choices of spatial orientation (that is, allowing for left-handed as well as right-handed coordinate systems) the cross product of two vectors is a [pseudovector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudovector "Pseudovector") instead of a vector (see below).

### Scalar triple product

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Euclidean_vector&action=edit&section=21 "Edit section: Scalar triple product")]

The _scalar triple product_ (also called the _box product_ or _mixed triple product_) is not really a new operator, but a way of applying the other two multiplication operators to three vectors. The scalar triple product is sometimes denoted by (**a****b****c**) and defined as:

![Image 71: {\displaystyle (\mathbf {a} \ \mathbf {b} \ \mathbf {c} )=\mathbf {a} \cdot (\mathbf {b} \times \mathbf {c} ).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1142a3702cba81e25f47ce126fd78ef9c048c636)

It has three primary uses. First, the absolute value of the box product is the volume of the [parallelepiped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallelepiped "Parallelepiped") which has edges that are defined by the three vectors. Second, the scalar triple product is zero if and only if the three vectors are [linearly dependent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_independence "Linear independence"), which can be easily proved by considering that in order for the three vectors to not make a volume, they must all lie in the same plane. Third, the box product is positive if and only if the three vectors **a**, **b** and **c** are right-handed.

In components (_with respect to a right-handed orthonormal basis_), if the three vectors are thought of as rows (or columns, but in the same order), the scalar triple product is simply the [determinant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant "Determinant") of the 3-by-3 [matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics) "Matrix (mathematics)") having the three vectors as rows ![Image 72: {\displaystyle (\mathbf {a} \ \mathbf {b} \ \mathbf {c} )={\begin{vmatrix}a_{1}&a_{2}&a_{3}\\b_{1}&b_{2}&b_{3}\\c_{1}&c_{2}&c_{3}\\\end{vmatrix}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9dc03ef4e187e8ecb9b630bc0e65cde5d6b92ce3)

The scalar triple product is linear in all three entries and anti-symmetric in the following sense: ![Image 73: {\displaystyle (\mathbf {a} \ \mathbf {b} \ \mathbf {c} )=(\mathbf {c} \ \mathbf {a} \ \mathbf {b} )=(\mathbf {b} \ \mathbf {c} \ \mathbf {a} )=-(\mathbf {a} \ \mathbf {c} \ \mathbf {b} )=-(\mathbf {b} \ \mathbf {a} \ \mathbf {c} )=-(\mathbf {c} \ \mathbf {b} \ \mathbf {a} ).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/63a6b0bcae5b0dd570e8b5cd01d52f846a0e9671)

### Conversion between multiple Cartesian bases

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Euclidean_vector&action=edit&section=22 "Edit section: Conversion between multiple Cartesian bases")]

All examples thus far have dealt with vectors expressed in terms of the same basis, namely, the _e_ basis {**e**1, **e**2, **e**3}. However, a vector can be expressed in terms of any number of different bases that are not necessarily aligned with each other, and still remain the same vector. In the _e_ basis, a vector **a** is expressed, by definition, as

![Image 74: {\displaystyle \mathbf {a} =p\mathbf {e} _{1}+q\mathbf {e} _{2}+r\mathbf {e} _{3}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a46c240c9e8f84359b11b3dff1e56bebfc254771)

The scalar components in the _e_ basis are, by definition,

![Image 75: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}p&=\mathbf {a} \cdot \mathbf {e} _{1},\\q&=\mathbf {a} \cdot \mathbf {e} _{2},\\r&=\mathbf {a} \cdot \mathbf {e} _{3}.\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/74449bf4fb2f63ec6ca7ac4e9f2788ce61085114)

In another orthonormal basis _n_ = {**n**1, **n**2, **n**3} that is not necessarily aligned with _e_, the vector **a** is expressed as

![Image 76: {\displaystyle \mathbf {a} =u\mathbf {n} _{1}+v\mathbf {n} _{2}+w\mathbf {n} _{3}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fd34d6a3c3de06410b0ec5cab533e4bde2e7970b)

and the scalar components in the _n_ basis are, by definition,

![Image 77: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}u&=\mathbf {a} \cdot \mathbf {n} _{1},\\v&=\mathbf {a} \cdot \mathbf {n} _{2},\\w&=\mathbf {a} \cdot \mathbf {n} _{3}.\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b6a797db7222828618b8ba3ad66b9a573b620b3a)

The values of _p_, _q_, _r_, and _u_, _v_, _w_ relate to the unit vectors in such a way that the resulting vector sum is exactly the same physical vector **a** in both cases. It is common to encounter vectors known in terms of different bases (for example, one basis fixed to the Earth and a second basis fixed to a moving vehicle). In such a case it is necessary to develop a method to convert between bases so the basic vector operations such as addition and subtraction can be performed. One way to express _u_, _v_, _w_ in terms of _p_, _q_, _r_ is to use column matrices along with a [direction cosine matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direction_cosine_matrix "Direction cosine matrix") containing the information that relates the two bases. Such an expression can be formed by substitution of the above equations to form

![Image 78: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}u&=(p\mathbf {e} _{1}+q\mathbf {e} _{2}+r\mathbf {e} _{3})\cdot \mathbf {n} _{1},\\v&=(p\mathbf {e} _{1}+q\mathbf {e} _{2}+r\mathbf {e} _{3})\cdot \mathbf {n} _{2},\\w&=(p\mathbf {e} _{1}+q\mathbf {e} _{2}+r\mathbf {e} _{3})\cdot \mathbf {n} _{3}.\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2371694817f9e0249e7eea50ea39d77e83c1cf1d)

Distributing the dot-multiplication gives

![Image 79: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}u&=p\mathbf {e} _{1}\cdot \mathbf {n} _{1}+q\mathbf {e} _{2}\cdot \mathbf {n} _{1}+r\mathbf {e} _{3}\cdot \mathbf {n} _{1},\\v&=p\mathbf {e} _{1}\cdot \mathbf {n} _{2}+q\mathbf {e} _{2}\cdot \mathbf {n} _{2}+r\mathbf {e} _{3}\cdot \mathbf {n} _{2},\\w&=p\mathbf {e} _{1}\cdot \mathbf {n} _{3}+q\mathbf {e} _{2}\cdot \mathbf {n} _{3}+r\mathbf {e} _{3}\cdot \mathbf {n} _{3}.\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/48df5046307a14d986fd95da5c0f5866b5d4d581)

Replacing each dot product with a unique scalar gives

![Image 80: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}u&=c_{11}p+c_{12}q+c_{13}r,\\v&=c_{21}p+c_{22}q+c_{23}r,\\w&=c_{31}p+c_{32}q+c_{33}r,\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/22c0c84c599131801b1fbce8212e2c50de3cb0ae)

and these equations can be expressed as the single matrix equation

![Image 81: {\displaystyle {\begin{bmatrix}u\\v\\w\\\end{bmatrix}}={\begin{bmatrix}c_{11}&c_{12}&c_{13}\\c_{21}&c_{22}&c_{23}\\c_{31}&c_{32}&c_{33}\end{bmatrix}}{\begin{bmatrix}p\\q\\r\end{bmatrix}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/69e8d252551f929b5ae4363e78a596eba80ef366)

This matrix equation relates the scalar components of **a** in the _n_ basis (_u_,_v_, and _w_) with those in the _e_ basis (_p_, _q_, and _r_). Each matrix element _c_ _jk_ is the [direction cosine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direction_cosine#Cartesian_coordinates "Direction cosine") relating **n**_j_ to **e**_k_.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_addition#cite_note-dynon16-20) The term _direction cosine_ refers to the [cosine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine "Cosine") of the angle between two unit vectors, which is also equal to their [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_addition#Dot_product).[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_addition#cite_note-dynon16-20) Therefore,

![Image 82: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}c_{11}&=\mathbf {n} _{1}\cdot \mathbf {e} _{1}\\c_{12}&=\mathbf {n} _{1}\cdot \mathbf {e} _{2}\\c_{13}&=\mathbf {n} _{1}\cdot \mathbf {e} _{3}\\c_{21}&=\mathbf {n} _{2}\cdot \mathbf {e} _{1}\\c_{22}&=\mathbf {n} _{2}\cdot \mathbf {e} _{2}\\c_{23}&=\mathbf {n} _{2}\cdot \mathbf {e} _{3}\\c_{31}&=\mathbf {n} _{3}\cdot \mathbf {e} _{1}\\c_{32}&=\mathbf {n} _{3}\cdot \mathbf {e} _{2}\\c_{33}&=\mathbf {n} _{3}\cdot \mathbf {e} _{3}\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/925d7bd0f1cf143a0082cca66933b943e0d5b27b)

By referring collectively to **e**1, **e**2, **e**3 as the _e_ basis and to **n**1, **n**2, **n**3 as the _n_ basis, the matrix containing all the _c_ _jk_ is known as the "[transformation matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_matrix "Transformation matrix") from _e_ to _n_", or the "[rotation matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix "Rotation matrix") from _e_ to _n_" (because it can be imagined as the "rotation" of a vector from one basis to another), or the "direction cosine matrix from _e_ to _n_"[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_addition#cite_note-dynon16-20) (because it contains direction cosines). The properties of a rotation matrix are such that its [inverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_inverse "Matrix inverse") is equal to its [transpose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_transpose "Matrix transpose"). This means that the "rotation matrix from _e_ to _n_" is the transpose of "rotation matrix from _n_ to _e_".

The properties of a direction cosine matrix, C are:[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_addition#cite_note-21)

*   the determinant is unity, |C| = 1;
*   the inverse is equal to the transpose;
*   the rows and columns are orthogonal unit vectors, therefore their dot products are zero.

The advantage of this method is that a direction cosine matrix can usually be obtained independently by using [Euler angles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_angles "Euler angles") or a [quaternion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion "Quaternion") to relate the two vector bases, so the basis conversions can be performed directly, without having to work out all the dot products described above.

By applying several matrix multiplications in succession, any vector can be expressed in any basis so long as the set of direction cosines is known relating the successive bases.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_addition#cite_note-dynon16-20)

With the exception of the cross and triple products, the above formulae generalise to two dimensions and higher dimensions. For example, addition generalises to two dimensions as ![Image 83: {\displaystyle (a_{1}{\mathbf {e} }_{1}+a_{2}{\mathbf {e} }_{2})+(b_{1}{\mathbf {e} }_{1}+b_{2}{\mathbf {e} }_{2})=(a_{1}+b_{1}){\mathbf {e} }_{1}+(a_{2}+b_{2}){\mathbf {e} }_{2},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4946d7e35e5891a754e03b29e4a426fa37b5403a) and in four dimensions as ![Image 84: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}(a_{1}{\mathbf {e} }_{1}+a_{2}{\mathbf {e} }_{2}+a_{3}{\mathbf {e} }_{3}+a_{4}{\mathbf {e} }_{4})&+(b_{1}{\mathbf {e} }_{1}+b_{2}{\mathbf {e} }_{2}+b_{3}{\mathbf {e} }_{3}+b_{4}{\mathbf {e} }_{4})=\\(a_{1}+b_{1}){\mathbf {e} }_{1}+(a_{2}+b_{2}){\mathbf {e} }_{2}&+(a_{3}+b_{3}){\mathbf {e} }_{3}+(a_{4}+b_{4}){\mathbf {e} }_{4}.\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e10d177a606e88d6d2e4207e81c0707f358f02f4)

The cross product does not readily generalise to other dimensions, though the closely related [exterior product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exterior_algebra#Areas_in_the_plane "Exterior algebra") does, whose result is a [bivector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bivector "Bivector"). In two dimensions this is simply a [pseudoscalar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoscalar "Pseudoscalar")![Image 85: {\displaystyle (a_{1}{\mathbf {e} }_{1}+a_{2}{\mathbf {e} }_{2})\wedge (b_{1}{\mathbf {e} }_{1}+b_{2}{\mathbf {e} }_{2})=(a_{1}b_{2}-a_{2}b_{1})\mathbf {e} _{1}\mathbf {e} _{2}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7140e34ca636b3531bf2e6500b62a6c237bb11ea)

A [seven-dimensional cross product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven-dimensional_cross_product "Seven-dimensional cross product") is similar to the cross product in that its result is a vector orthogonal to the two arguments; there is however no natural way of selecting one of the possible such products.

Vectors have many uses in physics and other sciences.

In abstract vector spaces, the length of the arrow depends on a [dimensionless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionless_number "Dimensionless number")[scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(measurement) "Scale (measurement)"). If it represents, for example, a force, the "scale" is of [physical dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis "Dimensional analysis") length/force. Thus there is typically consistency in scale among quantities of the same dimension, but otherwise scale ratios may vary; for example, if "1 newton" and "5 m" are both represented with an arrow of 2 cm, the scales are 1 m:50 N and 1:250 respectively. Equal length of vectors of different dimension has no particular significance unless there is some [proportionality constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportionality_constant "Proportionality constant") inherent in the system that the diagram represents. Also length of a unit vector (of dimension length, not length/force, etc.) has no coordinate-system-invariant significance.

### Vector-valued functions

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Euclidean_vector&action=edit&section=26 "Edit section: Vector-valued functions")]

Often in areas of physics and mathematics, a vector evolves in time, meaning that it depends on a time parameter _t_. For instance, if **r** represents the position vector of a particle, then **r**(_t_) gives a [parametric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_equation "Parametric equation") representation of the trajectory of the particle. Vector-valued functions can be [differentiated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative "Derivative") and [integrated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral "Integral") by differentiating or integrating the components of the vector, and many of the familiar rules from [calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus "Calculus") continue to hold for the derivative and integral of vector-valued functions.

### Position, velocity and acceleration

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Euclidean_vector&action=edit&section=27 "Edit section: Position, velocity and acceleration")]

The position of a point **x** = (_x_ 1, _x_ 2, _x_ 3) in three-dimensional space can be represented as a [position vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position_vector "Position vector") whose base point is the origin ![Image 86: {\displaystyle {\mathbf {x} }=x_{1}{\mathbf {e} }_{1}+x_{2}{\mathbf {e} }_{2}+x_{3}{\mathbf {e} }_{3}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9d1e4478308e8abaecb2607a9e650c40aaf416f1) The position vector has dimensions of [length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length "Length").

Given two points **x** = (_x_ 1, _x_ 2, _x_ 3), **y** = (_y_ 1, _y_ 2, _y_ 3) their [displacement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_(vector) "Displacement (vector)") is a vector ![Image 87: {\displaystyle {\mathbf {y} }-{\mathbf {x} }=(y_{1}-x_{1}){\mathbf {e} }_{1}+(y_{2}-x_{2}){\mathbf {e} }_{2}+(y_{3}-x_{3}){\mathbf {e} }_{3}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1c8d27c3febb9395a2c9c6dca51915b7be8a8d6d) which specifies the position of _y_ relative to _x_. The length of this vector gives the straight-line distance from _x_ to _y_. Displacement has the dimensions of length.

The [velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity "Velocity")**v** of a point or particle is a vector, its length gives the [speed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed "Speed"). For constant velocity the position at time _t_ will be ![Image 88: {\displaystyle {\mathbf {x} }_{t}=t{\mathbf {v} }+{\mathbf {x} }_{0},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/102b1e6c157766985713b2c1109e4befa92a0eca) where **x**0 is the position at time _t_ = 0. Velocity is the [time derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_addition#Ordinary_derivative) of position. Its dimensions are length/time.

[Acceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration "Acceleration")**a** of a point is vector which is the [time derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_addition#Ordinary_derivative) of velocity. Its dimensions are length/time 2.

### Force, energy, work

[Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force "Force") is a vector with dimensions of mass×length/time 2 (N m s −2) and [Newton's second law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_second_law "Newton's second law") is the scalar multiplication ![Image 89: {\displaystyle {\mathbf {F} }=m{\mathbf {a} }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3c9f5c3c08d9e2e6deb106bf363e700c2ef8f5f4)

Vectors, pseudovectors, and transformations
-------------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Euclidean_vector&action=edit&section=29 "Edit section: Vectors, pseudovectors, and transformations")]

An alternative characterization of Euclidean vectors, especially in physics, describes them as lists of quantities which behave in a certain way under a [coordinate transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_system "Coordinate system"). A _contravariant vector_ is required to have components that "transform opposite to the basis" under changes of [basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_(linear_algebra) "Basis (linear algebra)"). The vector itself does not change when the basis is transformed; instead, the components of the vector make a change that cancels the change in the basis. In other words, if the reference axes (and the basis derived from it) were rotated in one direction, the component representation of the vector would rotate in the opposite way to generate the same final vector. Similarly, if the reference axes were stretched in one direction, the components of the vector would reduce in an exactly compensating way. Mathematically, if the basis undergoes a transformation described by an [invertible matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertible_matrix "Invertible matrix")_M_, so that a coordinate vector **x** is transformed to **x**′ = _M_**x**, then a contravariant vector **v** must be similarly transformed via **v**′ = _M_![Image 91: {\displaystyle ^{-1}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d21ba9ae71e157827da571c142bb49c24b78e1a0)**v**. This important requirement is what distinguishes a contravariant vector from any other triple of physically meaningful quantities. For example, if _v_ consists of the _x_, _y_, and _z_-components of [velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity "Velocity"), then _v_ is a contravariant vector: if the coordinates of space are stretched, rotated, or twisted, then the components of the velocity transform in the same way. On the other hand, for instance, a triple consisting of the length, width, and height of a rectangular box could make up the three components of an abstract [vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space"), but this vector would not be contravariant, since rotating the box does not change the box's length, width, and height. Examples of contravariant vectors include [displacement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_(vector) "Displacement (vector)"), [velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity "Velocity"), [electric field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_field "Electric field"), [momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum "Momentum"), [force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force "Force"), and [acceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration "Acceleration").

In the language of [differential geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry "Differential geometry"), the requirement that the components of a vector transform according to the same matrix of the coordinate transition is equivalent to defining a _contravariant vector_ to be a [tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor "Tensor") of [contravariant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_and_contravariance_of_vectors "Covariance and contravariance of vectors") rank one. Alternatively, a contravariant vector is defined to be a [tangent vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_space "Tangent space"), and the rules for transforming a contravariant vector follow from the [chain rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_rule "Chain rule").

Some vectors transform like contravariant vectors, except that when they are reflected through a mirror, they flip _and_ gain a minus sign. A transformation that switches right-handedness to left-handedness and vice versa like a mirror does is said to change the _[orientation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientation\_(space) "Orientation (space)")_ of space. A vector which gains a minus sign when the orientation of space changes is called a _[pseudovector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudovector "Pseudovector")_ or an _axial vector_. Ordinary vectors are sometimes called _true vectors_ or _polar vectors_ to distinguish them from pseudovectors. Pseudovectors occur most frequently as the [cross product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_product "Cross product") of two ordinary vectors.

One example of a pseudovector is [angular velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_velocity "Angular velocity"). Driving in a [car](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car "Car"), and looking forward, each of the [wheels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel "Wheel") has an angular velocity vector pointing to the left. If the world is reflected in a mirror which switches the left and right side of the car, the _reflection_ of this angular velocity vector points to the right, but the _actual_ angular velocity vector of the wheel still points to the left, corresponding to the minus sign. Other examples of pseudovectors include [magnetic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field "Magnetic field"), [torque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque "Torque"), or more generally any cross product of two (true) vectors.

This distinction between vectors and pseudovectors is often ignored, but it becomes important in studying [symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry "Symmetry") properties.
