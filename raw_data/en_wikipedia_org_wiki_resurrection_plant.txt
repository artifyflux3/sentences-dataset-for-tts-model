The resurrection plant Selaginella lepidophylla reviving within 3 hours after the addition of water.

Examples include: Asteriscus (plant) ; [ 1 ] Dorcoceras hygrometrica , [ 2 ] Craterostigma , members of the Linderniaceae/Scrophulariaceae with snapdragon-like flowers Haberlea rhodopensis Mesembryanthemum , the plant can revive within a short period of time after a drought Myrothamnus flabellifolius , a plant species native to Southern Africa Pleopeltis polypodioides , also known as resurrection fern Ramonda serbica , a species in the family Gesneriaceae Selaginella lepidophylla , a plant species native to North America, Central and South America, and sold as a novelty Tillandsia Xerophyta , a monocotyledonous genus of 57 species [ 3 ] typically occurring on rock outcrops in Southern African grasslands Certain resurrection plants have long been sold in their dry, "lifeless" form as curiosities. This custom was noted by many 19th-century authors, and continues today.

In December, 2015, resurrection plants were featured in a TED talk given by Professor Jill Farrant , [ 4 ] Molecular and Cell Biology, University of Cape Town , South Africa , who performs targeted genetic modification of crop plants to make them tolerate desiccation by activating genes that are already there but not natively expressed in response to drought .
