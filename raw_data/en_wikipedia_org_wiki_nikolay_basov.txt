Nikolay Basov Николай Басов Basov in 1964 Born Nikolay Gennadiyevich Basov ( 1922-12-14 ) 14 December 1922 [ 1 ] Usman , Tambov Governorate , Russian SFSR [ 1 ] Died 1 July 2001 (2001-07-01) (aged 78) [ 1 ] Moscow , Russia [ 1 ] Resting place Novodevichy Cemetery , Moscow Alma mater Moscow Engineering Physics Institute Known for Invention of lasers and masers Spouse Ksenia Tikhonovna Basova [ 2 ] Children Dimitri Basov (physics professor at Columbia University ) Awards Nobel Prize in Physics (1964) Kalinga Prize (1986) Lomonosov Gold Medal (1989) Edward Teller Award 1991) Scientific career Fields Physics Institutions Lebedev Physical Institute Nikolay Gennadiyevich Basov ( Russian : Никола́й Генна́диевич Ба́сов ; 14 December 1922 – 1 July 2001) was a Russian Soviet physicist and educator. For his fundamental work in the field of quantum electronics that led to the development of laser and maser , Basov shared the 1964 Nobel Prize in Physics with Alexander Prokhorov and Charles Hard Townes .

[ 3 ] Early life [ edit ] Basov was born in the town of Usman , now in Lipetsk Oblast in 1922.

[ 4 ] He finished school in 1941 in Voronezh , and was later called for military service at Kuibyshev Military Medical Academy . In 1943 he left the academy and served in the Red Army [ 4 ] participating in the Second World War with the 1st Ukrainian Front .

Professional career [ edit ] Basov graduated from Moscow Engineering Physics Institute (MEPhI) in 1950. He then held a professorship at MEPhI and also worked in the Lebedev Physical Institute (LPI), where he defended a dissertation for the Candidate of Sciences degree (equivalent to PhD ) in 1953 and a dissertation for the Doctor of Sciences degree in 1956. Basov was the Director of the LPI in 1973–1988. He was elected as corresponding member of the USSR Academy of Sciences ( Russian Academy of Sciences since 1991) in 1962 and Full Member of the Academy in 1966.

[ 1 ] In 1967, he was elected a Member of the Presidium of the Academy (1967—1990), and since 1990 he was the councillor of the Presidium of the USSR Academy of Sciences. In 1971 he was elected a Member of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina .

[ 5 ] He was Honorary President and Member of the International Academy of Science, Munich.

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] He was the head of the laboratory of quantum radiophysics at the LPI until his death in 2001.

[ 3 ] In the early 1950s Basov and Prokhorov developed theoretical grounds for creation of a molecular oscillator and constructed such an oscillator based on ammonia . Later this oscillator became known as maser . They also proposed a method for the production of population inversion using inhomogeneous electric and magnetic fields. Their results were presented at a national conference in 1952 and published in 1954. Basov then proceeded to the development of laser, an analogous generator of coherent light. In 1955 he designed a three-level laser , and in 1959 suggested constructing a semiconductor laser , which he built with collaborators in 1963.

[ 1 ] Basov  with co-workers proposed Disk laser in 1966 [ 8 ] and realized experimentally the thin disk active mirror semiconductor lasers.

[ 9 ] He developed with colleaguaes the first nonlinear theory of coherent addition of laser sets.

[ 10 ] N.G.Basov encouraged the researchers in nonlinear optics in Lebedev Institute who discovered the optical phase conjugation .

[ 11 ] Together with Lebedev Institute researchers he realized the robust method of the phase-locking of laser arrays via optical phase conjugation in Stimulated Brillouin scattering .

[ 12 ] [ 13 ] Basov's contributions to the development of the laser and maser, which won him the Nobel Prize in 1964, also led to new missile defense initiatives.

[ 14 ] He died on 1 July, 2001 at Moscow and was buried at Novodevichy Cemetery .

Politics [ edit ] He entered politics in 1951 [ clarification needed ] and became a member of parliament (the Soviet of the Union of the Supreme Soviet ) in 1974.

[ 4 ] Following U.S. President Ronald Reagan 's speech on SDI in 1983, Basov signed a letter along with other Soviet scientists condemning the initiative, which was published in the New York Times.

[ 15 ] In 1985 he declared the Soviet Union was capable of matching SDI proposals made by the U.S.
