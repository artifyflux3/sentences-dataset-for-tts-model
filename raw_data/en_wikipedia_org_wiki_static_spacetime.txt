( April 2021 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) In general relativity , a spacetime is said to be static if it does not change over time and is also irrotational. It is a special case of a stationary spacetime , which is the geometry of a stationary spacetime that does not change in time but can rotate.  Thus, the Kerr solution provides an example of a stationary spacetime that is not static; the non-rotating Schwarzschild solution is an example that is static.

Formally, a spacetime is static if it admits a global, non-vanishing, timelike Killing vector field K {\displaystyle K} which is irrotational , i.e.

, whose orthogonal distribution is involutive . (Note that the leaves of the associated foliation are necessarily space-like hypersurfaces .) Thus, a static spacetime is a stationary spacetime satisfying this additional integrability condition. These spacetimes form one of the simplest classes of Lorentzian manifolds .

Locally, every static spacetime looks like a standard static spacetime which is a Lorentzian warped product R × × {\displaystyle \times } S with a metric of the form g [ ( t , x ) ] = − − β β ( x ) d t 2 + g S [ x ] {\displaystyle g[(t,x)]=-\beta (x)dt^{2}+g_{S}[x]} , where R is the real line, g S {\displaystyle g_{S}} is a (positive definite) metric and β β {\displaystyle \beta } is a positive function on the Riemannian manifold S .

In such a local coordinate representation the Killing field K {\displaystyle K} may be identified with ∂ ∂ t {\displaystyle \partial _{t}} and S , the manifold of K {\displaystyle K} - trajectories , may be regarded as the instantaneous 3-space of stationary observers. If λ λ {\displaystyle \lambda } is the square of the norm of the Killing vector field, λ λ = g ( K , K ) {\displaystyle \lambda =g(K,K)} , both λ λ {\displaystyle \lambda } and g S {\displaystyle g_{S}} are independent of time (in fact λ λ = − − β β ( x ) {\displaystyle \lambda =-\beta (x)} ). It is from the latter fact that a static spacetime obtains its name, as the geometry of the space-like slice S does not change over time.

Examples of static spacetimes [ edit ] The (exterior) Schwarzschild solution .

De Sitter space (the portion of it covered by the static patch ).

Reissner–Nordström space.

The Weyl solution , a static axisymmetric solution of the Einstein vacuum field equations R μ μ ν ν = 0 {\displaystyle R_{\mu \nu }=0} discovered by Hermann Weyl .

Examples of non-static spacetimes [ edit ] In general, "almost all" spacetimes will not be static. Some explicit examples include: Spherically symmetric spacetimes , which are irrotational, but not static.

The Kerr solution , since it describes a rotating black hole, is a stationary spacetime that is not static.

Spacetimes with gravitational waves in them are not even stationary.
