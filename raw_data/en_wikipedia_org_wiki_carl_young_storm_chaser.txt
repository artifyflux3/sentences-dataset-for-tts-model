Died May 31, 2013 (2013-05-31) (aged 45) Canadian County, Oklahoma , U.S.

Cause of death Tornado incident, ejected from the car by EF3 El Reno Known for Tornado field research Scientific career Fields Engineering, meteorology Carl Richard Young (May 14, 1968 – May 31, 2013) [ 1 ] [ 2 ] was an American meteorologist and storm chaser who worked with the TWISTEX research team. He was one of the first storm chasers in the United States to die during a tornado; he was killed during the 2013 El Reno tornado , along side Tim Samaras and Paul Samaras.

Life [ edit ] Young was born in Oakland, California on May 14, 1968. He graduated from Carmel High School and received a bachelor's degree from the University of California, Berkeley in the field of economics.

[ 3 ] [ 1 ] Young also received a master's degree in atmospheric science at the University of Nevada, Reno .

[ 4 ] He began storm chasing in 2000 following work on Hollywood film sets.

[ 5 ] At ChaserCon in 2002, Young met Tim Samaras ; the pair would go on several storm chases together, seeing a total of over 125 tornadoes.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] In 2012, Young helped film the documentary series Storm Chasers , which aired on the Discovery Channel .

[ 7 ] In early 2013, Young promised to Dalia Terleckaite, who was his girlfriend at the time, that he would cease chasing, although Young continued to chase storms.

[ 8 ] Prior to his death, Young also helped write Monthly Weather Review publications with the TWISTEX team.

[ 9 ] El Reno tornado and death [ edit ] See also: 2013 El Reno tornado In the spring of 2013, TWISTEX was conducting lightning research (including with a high-speed camera ) when active tornadic periods ensued in mid to late May. Young drove a Chevorlet Cobalt to the Oklahoma City area along with Tim and Paul Samaras.

[ 10 ] [ 11 ] At 6:23 p.m. on May 31, 2013, all three members of the group were killed by a violent tornado with wind speeds estimated to have been in excess of 295 mph (475 km/h) near the Regional Airport of El Reno, Oklahoma .

[ 12 ] The TWISTEX vehicle was struck and thrown by a subvortex, which generate the highest winds; some of these were moving at 175 mph (282 km/h) within the parent tornado.

[ 13 ] Shortly before they were killed, Young noted how there was no rain around the vehicle as the wind grew "eerily calm". Tim Samaras responded: "Actually, I think we're in a bad spot." [ 14 ] The tornado was sampled by University of Oklahoma RaXPol radar as 2.6 miles (4.2 km) wide, the widest tornado ever recorded.

[ 15 ] The true size of the multiple-vortex tornado confused onlookers by its mammoth proportions containing orbiting subvortices larger than average tornadoes and its expansive transparent to translucent outer circulation. The strong inflow and outer-circulation winds in conjunction with rocky roads and a relatively underpowered vehicle also hampered driving away from the tornado. The tornado simultaneously took an unexpected sharp turn, closing on their position as it rapidly accelerated within a few minutes from about 20 mph (32 km/h) to as much as 60 mph (97 km/h) in forward movement and swiftly expanded from about 1 mile (1.6 km) to 2.6 miles (4.2 km) wide in about 30 seconds, and was mostly obscured in heavy precipitation , [ 12 ] all of which combined so that several other chasers were also hit or had near misses.

[ 16 ] It was the first known instance of a storm chaser or a meteorologist killed by a tornado.

[ 17 ] Young's body was found 0.5 miles (0.80 km) miles away from the vehicle.

[ 18 ] The vehicle where Young died, located near El Reno, Oklahoma .

[ 19 ] Even before it was known that Young and the two other passengers had been killed, the event led many to question storm-chasing tactics, particularly in close proximity to tornadoes.

[ 20 ] In addition to the three TWISTEX members, the tornado killed five other people, including local resident Richard Charles Henderson, who had decided to follow the storm.

[ 21 ] Atmospheric scientists and storm chasers embarked on a major project to gather information and analyze what happened regarding chaser actions and meteorological occurrences.

[ 22 ] A makeshift memorial was established at the site soon after the incident [ 23 ] and a crowdfunded permanent memorial, spearheaded by Doug Gerten, the deputy who first found the vehicle wreckage, [ 24 ] was later established, although it was vandalized in late March 2016, with the monument struck by bullets and the American flag cut away from the flagpole.
