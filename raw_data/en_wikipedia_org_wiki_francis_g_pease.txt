Pease, 1930ca.

Francis Gladheim Pease (January 14, 1881 – February 7, 1938) was an American astronomer .

He joined the Yerkes Observatory in Wisconsin , where he was an observer and an optician. There he assisted George W. Ritchey who built many of America's first large reflecting telescopes . In 1908 he became an astronomer and instrument maker at the Mount Wilson Observatory . Among his designs was the 100-inch (2,500 mm) telescope at that observatory, and a 50-foot (15 m) interferometer that he used to measure star diameters.

Gene Shoemaker used Pease's high quality photographs of the Moon to make its first geological map .

[ 1 ] He was a longtime assistant to Albert A. Michelson . In 1920, Michelson and Pease were able to use the Michelson stellar interferometer fitted to the 100-inch (2,500 mm) telescope at Mt. Wilson to measure the angular diameter of the star Betelgeuse . Their estimate of 0.047" was very close to the value that Eddington had predicted.

He would later be involved in the design of the 200-inch (5,100 mm) Hale Telescope at the Mount Palomar Observatory . In 1928 he made the first discovery of a planetary nebula within a globular cluster , later called Pease 1 .

[ 2 ] The crater Pease on the Moon is named after him.
