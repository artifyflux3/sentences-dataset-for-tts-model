Died 20 April 2025 (2025-04-20) (aged 95) Manhattan, New York , U.S.

Alma mater Harvard University ( Ph.D.

) Scientific career Fields Physics , mathematics Doctoral advisor Julian Schwinger Jeremy Bernstein (December 31, 1929 – April 20, 2025) was an American theoretical physicist and popular science writer.

Early life [ edit ] Bernstein's parents, Philip S. Bernstein, a Reform rabbi, and Sophie Rubin Bernstein named him after the biblical Jeremiah , the subject of his father's masters thesis .  Philip's parents were immigrants from Lithuania , while Sophie was of Russian-Jewish descent.  The family moved from Rochester to New York City during World War II , when his father became head of all the Jewish chaplains in the armed forces .

[ 1 ] Education and career [ edit ] Bernstein studied at Harvard University , receiving his bachelor's degree in 1951, his master's in 1953, and his Ph.D.

in 1955, on electromagnetic properties of deuterium , under Julian Schwinger .  As a theoretical physicist, he worked on elementary particle physics and cosmology .  A summer spent in Los Alamos led to a position at the Institute for Advanced Study .

[ 2 ] In 1962 he became a faculty member at New York University , moving to become a professor of Physics at Stevens Institute of Technology in 1967, a position that he continues to hold as professor emeritus .

[ 3 ] He has held adjunct or visiting positions at the Brookhaven National Laboratory , CERN , Oxford , the University of Islamabad , and the Ecole Polytechnique .

[ 4 ] Bernstein was involved in Project Orion , investigating the potential for nuclear pulse propulsion for use in space travel .

[ 5 ] In 2025, before his death in April, he was the last living member of the senior personnel of the project.

Bernstein died on April 20, 2025, at the age of 95.

[ 6 ] Popular writing [ edit ] Bernstein was a popular science writer and profiler of scientists. He was a staff writer for The New Yorker from 1961 to 1995, authoring scores of articles.

[ 7 ] He also wrote regularly for The Atlantic Monthly , the New York Review of Books , and Scientific American , among others. Bernstein's biographical profiles of physicists, including Robert Oppenheimer , Hans Bethe , Albert Einstein , John Stewart Bell and others, were able to draw on the experiences of personal acquaintance.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] In 2018, Bernstein published A Bouquet of Dyson: and Other Reflections on Science and Scientists.
