The population was 6,764 according to the 2020 census, [ 1 ] making it the least populated town in the county.

Berkley is a part of the South Coast region of Massachusetts which encompasses the cities and towns that surround Buzzards Bay (excluding the Elizabeth Islands , Bourne and Falmouth ), Mount Hope Bay and the Sakonnet River .

History [ edit ] Old Town Hall was built in 1849 The present town of Berkley, then belonging to the neighboring towns of Dighton and Taunton , was first settled in 1638. It was officially incorporated as a separate town in 1735. The town was named for the philosopher and bishop George Berkeley (1685–1753), who lived in Newport, Rhode Island from 1728 to 1731. The change in the spelling to "Berkley" was likely due to the carelessness of the engrossing clerk of the Massachusetts General Court .

[ 2 ] Berkley's old Town Hall, a two-story white clapboard building located on Berkley Common , was built in 1849.

[ 3 ] When a new Town Hall was built across the street in 2015, the Old Town Hall became home to the Berkley Historical Society .

[ 3 ] The new 9,778-square-foot Town Hall was built in 2014–2015, at a cost of $3.5 million.

[ 4 ] The new building contains a senior center, office, kitchen, and high-efficiency LED lighting.

[ 4 ] Geography [ edit ] 1895 map of Berkley According to the United States Census Bureau , the town has a total area of 17.4 square miles (45.1 km 2 ), of which 16.5 square miles (42.8 km 2 ) is land and 0.93 square miles (2.4 km 2 ), or 5.24%, is water.

[ 5 ] The town is bordered by the Taunton River and Dighton to the west, Taunton to the north and northeast, Lakeville to the east, and the Assonet Bay and Freetown to the south. The town is located 35 miles (56 km) south of Boston , 22 miles (35 km) east of Providence, Rhode Island , and 30 miles (48 km) northwest of the Cape Cod Canal .

Near the southwestern corner of the town is Dighton Rock State Park , the home of Dighton Rock , a tidal boulder along the Taunton River that is well known for its strange markings, which have been totally or partly attributed to Norsemen , Wampanoags , or Portuguese explorer Miguel Corte-Real . At the southern tip of Berkley Neck which points into the confluence of the Taunton River and the Assonet River , there is a small island, named " Conspiracy Island ", whose name origin remains obscure.

The highest point in Berkley is the summit of Bryant Hill near the southern border of the town, at 167 feet (51 m) above sea level.

[ 6 ] The town can be accessed by two state routes, Route 24 and Route 79 . Route 24, a four-lane divided freeway, bisects the town, and includes one exit for the town at Padelford Street.  Route 79 passes along the town's border with Lakeville, and meets Route 140 just across the town line in Taunton. The Berkley–Dighton Bridge crosses the Taunton River to the Segreganset neighborhood of Dighton.  The current bridge was completed in 2015, and is the only bridge to cross the river between the Brightman Street Bridge between Fall River and Somerset , and the Plain Street Bridge in Taunton, a distance of 12.5 miles (20.1 km).

Myricks is an association community or populated place (Class Code U6) and a junction of railroad lines in Berkley.
