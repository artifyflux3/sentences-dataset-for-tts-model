A poster of the planets and moons visited during the Voyager program.

The **Voyager program** is an American scientific program that employs two [interstellar probes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_probe "Interstellar probe"), _[Voyager 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager\_1 "Voyager 1")_ and _[Voyager 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager\_2 "Voyager 2")_. They were launched in 1977 to take advantage of a favorable planetary alignment to explore the two gas giants [Jupiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter "Jupiter") and [Saturn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn "Saturn") and potentially also the ice giants, Uranus and Neptune—to [fly near them](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flyby_(spaceflight) "Flyby (spaceflight)") while collecting data for transmission back to Earth. After _Voyager 1_ successfully completed its flyby of Saturn and its moon [Titan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_(moon) "Titan (moon)"), it was decided to send _Voyager 2_ on flybys of [Uranus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranus "Uranus") and [Neptune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neptune "Neptune").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-The_Fantastic_Voyage_of_Voyager-1)

After the planetary flybys were complete, decisions were made to keep the probes in operation to explore [interstellar space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_space "Outer space") and the outer regions of the Solar System. On 25 August 2012, data from _Voyager 1_ indicated that it had entered interstellar space.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-JPL.NASA-2) On 5 November 2019, data from _Voyager 2_ indicated that it also had entered interstellar space.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-NASA-20181210-3) On 4 November 2019, scientists reported that on 5 November 2018, the _Voyager 2_ probe had officially reached the [interstellar medium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_medium "Interstellar medium") (ISM), a region of [outer space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_space "Outer space") beyond the influence of the [solar wind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_wind "Solar wind"), as did _Voyager 1_ in 2012.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-EA-20191104-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-NYT-20191104-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-NASA-Solar-System-6) In August 2018, NASA confirmed, based on results by the _[New Horizons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New\_Horizons "New Horizons")_ spacecraft, the existence of a "[hydrogen wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliosphere#Hydrogen_wall "Heliosphere")" at the outer edges of the Solar System that was first detected in 1992 by the two Voyager spacecraft.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-GRL-20180807-7)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-LS-20180809-8)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-9)

As of 2024, the Voyagers are still in operation beyond the outer boundary of the [heliosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliosphere "Heliosphere") in [interstellar space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_space "Interstellar space"). _Voyager 1_ is moving with a velocity of 61,198 kilometers per hour (38,027 mph), or 17 km/s, (10.5 miles/second) relative to the Sun, and is 24,475,900,000 kilometers (1.52086×10 10 mi) from the Sun[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-JPL.Voyager1-10) reaching a distance of 162[AU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit "Astronomical unit") (24.2[billion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1000000000_(number) "1000000000 (number)")[km](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilometre "Kilometre"); 15.1 billion[mi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mile "Mile")) from Earth as of May 25, 2024.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-voyager-11) As of 2024, _Voyager 2_ is moving with a velocity of 55,347 kilometers per hour (34,391 mph), or 15 km/s, relative to the Sun, and is 20,439,100,000 kilometers (1.27003×10 10 mi) from the Sun[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-JPL.Voyager2-12) reaching a distance of 136.627[AU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit "Astronomical unit") (20.4[billion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1000000000_(number) "1000000000 (number)")[km](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilometre "Kilometre"); 12.7 billion[mi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mile "Mile")) from Earth as of May 25, 2024.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-voyager-11)

The two Voyagers are the only human-made objects to date that have passed into interstellar space — a record they will hold until at least the 2040s — and _Voyager 1_ is the farthest human-made object from Earth.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-:0-13)

Plot of _Voyager 2_'s heliocentric velocity against its distance from the Sun, illustrating the use of gravity assist to accelerate the spacecraft by Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus. To observe [Triton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triton_(moon) "Triton (moon)"), _Voyager 2_ passed over Neptune's north pole, resulting in an acceleration out of the plane of the ecliptic and reduced its velocity away from the Sun.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-14)

> Voyager did things no one predicted, found scenes no one expected, and promises to outlive its inventors. Like a great painting or an abiding institution, it has acquired an existence of its own, a destiny beyond the grasp of its handlers.

The two Voyager space probes were originally conceived as part of the [Planetary Grand Tour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_Grand_Tour "Planetary Grand Tour") planned during the late 1960s and early 70s that aimed to explore [Jupiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter "Jupiter"), [Saturn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn "Saturn"), Saturn's moon [Titan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_(moon) "Titan (moon)"), [Uranus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranus "Uranus"), [Neptune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neptune "Neptune"), and [Pluto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluto "Pluto"). The mission originated from the [Grand Tour program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Tour_program "Grand Tour program"), conceptualized by [Gary Flandro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Flandro "Gary Flandro"), an [aerospace engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace_engineer "Aerospace engineer") at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, in 1964, which leveraged a rare [planetary alignment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syzygy_(astronomy) "Syzygy (astronomy)") occurring once every 175 years.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-15)[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-16) This alignment allowed a craft to reach all [outer planets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_planets "Outer planets") using [gravitational assists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_assist "Gravitational assist"). The mission was to send several pairs of probes and gained momentum in 1966 when it was endorsed by [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA "NASA")'s [Jet Propulsion Laboratory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_Propulsion_Laboratory "Jet Propulsion Laboratory"). However, in December 1971, the Grand Tour mission was canceled when funding was redirected to the [Space Shuttle program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_program "Space Shuttle program").[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-GTN-17)

In 1972, a scaled-down (four planets, two identical spacecraft) mission was proposed, utilizing a spacecraft derived from the [Mariner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariner_program "Mariner program") series, initially intended to be [Mariner 11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariner_11 "Mariner 11") and [Mariner 12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariner_12 "Mariner 12"). The [gravity-assist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity-assist "Gravity-assist") technique, successfully demonstrated by [Mariner 10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariner_10 "Mariner 10"), would be used to achieve significant velocity changes by maneuvering through an intermediate planet's [gravitational field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_field "Gravitational field") to minimize time towards Saturn.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-HMSmurmeier1974-18) The spacecrafts were then moved into a separate program named **Mariner Jupiter-Saturn** (also **Mariner Jupiter-Saturn-Uranus**,[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-19)**MJS**, or **MJSU**), part of the [Mariner program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariner_program "Mariner program"), later renamed because it was thought that the design of the two space probes had progressed sufficiently beyond that of the Mariner family to merit a separate name.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-20)

[![Image 4](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/Voyager_Probe.stl/330px-Voyager_Probe.stl.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Voyager_Probe.stl)

Interactive 3D model of the Voyager spacecraft .

On March 4, 1977, [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA "NASA") announced a competition to rename the mission, believing the existing name was not appropriate as the mission had differed significantly from previous [Mariner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariner_program "Mariner program") missions. _Voyager_ was chosen as the new name, referencing an earlier suggestion by [William Pickering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Pickering_(rocket_scientist) "Bill Pickering (rocket scientist)"), who had proposed the name _Navigator_. Due to the name change occurring close to launch, the probes were still occasionally referred to as Mariner 11 and Mariner 12, or even Voyager 11 and Voyager 12.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-GTN-17)

Two mission trajectories were established: JST aimed at Jupiter, Saturn, and enhancing a [Titan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_(moon) "Titan (moon)") flyby, while JSX served as a contingency plan. JST focused on a Titan flyby, while JSX provided a flexible mission plan. If JST succeeded, JSX could proceed with the Grand Tour, but in case of failure, JSX could be redirected for a separate Titan flyby, forfeiting the Grand Tour opportunity.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-HMSmurmeier1974-18) The second probe, now [Voyager 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_2 "Voyager 2"), followed the JSX trajectory, granting it the option to continue on to Uranus and Neptune. Upon [Voyager 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_1 "Voyager 1") completing its main objectives at Saturn, Voyager 2 received a mission extension, enabling it to proceed to Uranus and Neptune. This allowed Voyager 2 to diverge from the originally planned JST trajectory.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-GTN-17)

The probes would be launched in August or September 1977, with their main objective being to compare the characteristics of Jupiter and Saturn, such as their [atmospheres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheres "Atmospheres"), [magnetic fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field "Magnetic field"), particle environments, [ring systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_system "Ring system"), and [moons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moons "Moons"). They would fly by planets and moons in either a JST or JSX trajectory. After completing their flybys, the probes would communicate with Earth, relaying vital data using their [magnetometers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetometer "Magnetometer"), [spectrometers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrometer "Spectrometer"), and other instruments to detect [interstellar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_medium "Interstellar medium"), [solar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_radiation "Solar radiation"), and [cosmic radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_radiation "Cosmic radiation"). Their radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) would limit the maximum communication time with the probes to roughly a [decade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decade "Decade"). Following their primary missions, the probes would continue to drift into interstellar space.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-HMSmurmeier1974-18)

_[Voyager 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager\_2 "Voyager 2")_ was the first to be launched. Its trajectory was designed to allow flybys of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. _Voyager 1_ was launched after _Voyager 2_, but along a shorter and faster trajectory that was designed to provide an optimal flyby of Saturn's moon [Titan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_(moon) "Titan (moon)"),[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-Swift1997-21) which was known to be quite large and to possess a dense atmosphere. This encounter sent _Voyager 1_ out of the plane of the ecliptic, ending its planetary science mission.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-22) Had _Voyager 1_ been unable to perform the Titan flyby, the trajectory of _Voyager 2_ could have been altered to explore Titan, forgoing any visit to Uranus and Neptune.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-Bell2015-23)_Voyager 1_ was not launched on a trajectory that would have allowed it to continue to Uranus and Neptune, but could have continued from Saturn to Pluto without exploring Titan.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-Stern-24)

During the 1990s, _Voyager 1_ overtook the slower deep-space probes [Pioneer 10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer_10 "Pioneer 10") and [Pioneer 11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer_11 "Pioneer 11") to become the most distant human-made object from Earth, a record that it will keep for the foreseeable future. The _[New Horizons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New\_Horizons "New Horizons")_ probe, which had a higher launch velocity than _Voyager 1_, is travelling more slowly due to the extra speed _Voyager 1_ gained from its flybys of Jupiter and Saturn. _Voyager 1_ and Pioneer 10 are the most widely separated human-made objects anywhere since they are travelling in roughly opposite directions from the [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System "Solar System").

In December 2004, _Voyager 1_ crossed the [termination shock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Termination_shock "Termination shock"), where the solar wind is slowed to subsonic speed, and entered the [heliosheath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliosheath "Heliosheath"), where the solar wind is compressed and made turbulent due to interactions with the [interstellar medium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_medium "Interstellar medium"). On 10 December 2007, _Voyager 2_ also reached the termination shock, about 1.6 billion kilometres (1 billion miles) closer to the Sun than from where _Voyager 1_ first crossed it, indicating that the Solar System is [asymmetrical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetry "Asymmetry").[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-25)

In 2010 _Voyager 1_ reported that the outward velocity of the solar wind had dropped to zero, and scientists predicted it was nearing [interstellar space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_space "Interstellar space").[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-26) In 2011, data from the Voyagers determined that the heliosheath was not smooth, but filled with giant [magnetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic "Magnetic") bubbles. It was theorized that they formed when the [magnetic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field "Magnetic field") of the Sun became warped at the edge of the Solar System.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-27)

In June 2012, Scientists at NASA reported that _[Voyager 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager\_1 "Voyager 1")_ was very close to entering interstellar space, which was indicated by a sharp rise in [high-energy particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_ray "Cosmic ray") from outside the Solar System.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-BBC-20120615-28)[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-Ferris-201205-29) In September 2013, NASA announced that _Voyager 1_ had crossed the [heliopause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliopause_(astronomy) "Heliopause (astronomy)") on 25 August 2012, making it the first spacecraft to enter interstellar space.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-NASA-20130912-30)[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-agu-31)[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-NASA-32)

In December 2018, NASA announced that _Voyager 2_ had crossed the heliopause on 5 November 2018, making it the second spacecraft to enter interstellar space.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-NASA-20181210-3)

As of 2017 _Voyager 1_ and _Voyager 2_ continued to monitor conditions in the outer expanses of the Solar System.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-NYT-20170905-33) The Voyager spacecraft were expected to be able to operate science instruments through 2020, when limited power would require instruments to be deactivated one by one. It was expected that circa 2025 there would no longer be sufficient power to operate any scientific instruments.

In July 2019, a revised power management plan was implemented for the two probes' dwindling power supplies.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-NASA-20190712-34)

Voyager spacecraft diagram

The Voyager spacecraft each weighed 815 kilograms (1,797 pounds) at launch, but after fuel usage are now about 733 kilograms (1,616 pounds).[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-FAQ-35) Of this weight, each spacecraft carries 105 kilograms (231 pounds) of scientific instruments.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-36) The identical Voyager spacecraft use three-axis-stabilized [guidance systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guidance_system "Guidance system") that use [gyroscopic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyroscopic "Gyroscopic") and [accelerometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerometer "Accelerometer") inputs to their [attitude control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft_attitude_control "Spacecraft attitude control") computers to point their [high-gain antennas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-gain_antenna "High-gain antenna") towards [the Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Earth "The Earth") and their scientific instruments towards their targets, sometimes with the help of a movable instrument platform for the smaller instruments and the [electronic photography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_camera_tube "Video camera tube") system.

The diagram shows the high-gain antenna (HGA) with a 3.7 m (12 ft) diameter dish attached to the hollow [decagonal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decagon "Decagon")[electronics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics "Electronics") container. There is also a spherical tank that contains the [hydrazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrazine "Hydrazine")[monopropellant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopropellant "Monopropellant") fuel.

The [Voyager Golden Record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_Golden_Record "Voyager Golden Record") is attached to one of the bus sides. The angled square panel to the right is the optical calibration target and excess heat radiator. The three [radioisotope thermoelectric generators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioisotope_thermoelectric_generators "Radioisotope thermoelectric generators") (RTGs) are mounted end-to-end on the lower boom.

The scan platform comprises: the Infrared Interferometer Spectrometer (IRIS) (largest camera at top right); the Ultraviolet Spectrometer (UVS) just above the IRIS; the two Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) [vidicon cameras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vidicon#Vidicon "Vidicon") to the left of the UVS; and the Photopolarimeter System (PPS) under the ISS.

Only five investigation teams are still supported, though data is collected for two additional instruments.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-37) The Flight Data Subsystem (FDS) and a single eight-track [digital tape recorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_tape "Magnetic tape") (DTR) provide the data handling functions.

The FDS configures each instrument and controls instrument operations. It also collects engineering and science data and formats the data for [transmission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transmission "Data transmission"). The DTR is used to record high-rate [Plasma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics) "Plasma (physics)") Wave Subsystem (PWS) data, which is played back every six months.

The Imaging Science Subsystem made up of a wide-angle and a narrow-angle camera is a modified version of the slow scan vidicon camera designs that were used in the earlier Mariner flights. The Imaging Science Subsystem consists of two television-type cameras, each with eight filters in a commandable filter wheel mounted in front of the vidicons. One has a low resolution 200 mm (7.9 in) [focal length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_length "Focal length") wide-angle lens with an [aperture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aperture "Aperture") of f/3 (the wide-angle camera), while the other uses a higher resolution 1,500 mm (59 in) narrow-angle f/8.5 lens (the narrow-angle camera).

Three spacecraft were built, _Voyager 1_ (VGR 77-1), _Voyager 2_ (VGR 77-3), and test spare model (VGR 77-2).[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPyne201039-38)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-:0-13)

### Computers and data processing

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Voyager_program&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Computers and data processing")]

There are three different computer types on the Voyager spacecraft, two of each kind, sometimes used for redundancy. They are proprietary, custom-built computers built from [CMOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMOS "CMOS") and [TTL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor%E2%80%93transistor_logic "Transistor–transistor logic") medium-scale CMOS integrated circuits and discrete components, mostly from the [7400 series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7400-series_integrated_circuits "7400-series integrated circuits") of [Texas Instruments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Instruments "Texas Instruments").[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-41) Total number of [words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_(computer_architecture) "Word (computer architecture)") among the six computers is about 32K. Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 have identical computer systems.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-FAQ-35)[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-42)

The Computer Command System (CCS), the central controller of the spacecraft, has two 18-bit word, interrupt-type processors with 4096 words each of non-volatile [plated-wire memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plated-wire_memory "Plated-wire memory"). During most of the Voyager mission the two CCS computers on each spacecraft were used non-redundantly to increase the command and processing capability of the spacecraft. The CCS is nearly identical to the system flown on the Viking spacecraft.[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-Tomayko-43)

The Flight Data System (FDS) is two 16-bit word machines with modular memories and 8198 words each.

The Attitude and Articulation Control System (AACS) is two 18-bit word machines with 4096 words each.

Unlike the other on-board instruments, the operation of the cameras for [visible light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visible_light "Visible light") is not autonomous, but rather it is controlled by an imaging parameter table contained in one of the on-board [digital computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_computer "Digital computer"), the Flight Data Subsystem (FDS). More recent space probes, since about 1990, usually have completely [autonomous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automaton "Automaton") cameras.

The computer command subsystem (CCS) controls the cameras. The CCS contains fixed [computer programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program "Computer program") such as command decoding, fault detection, and correction routines, antenna-pointing routines, and spacecraft sequencing routines. This computer is an improved version of the one that was used in the [_Viking_ orbiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viking_program "Viking program").[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-Tomayko-43) The hardware in both custom-built CCS subsystems in the Voyagers is identical. There is only a minor software modification for one of them that has a scientific subsystem that the other lacks.

According to Guinness Book of Records, CCS holds record of "longest period of continual operation for a computer". It has been running continuously since 20 August 1977.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-44)

The Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem (AACS) controls the spacecraft orientation (its attitude). It keeps the high-gain antenna pointing towards the Earth, controls attitude changes, and points the scan platform. The custom-built AACS systems on both craft are identical.

It has been erroneously reported[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-45) on the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet "Internet") that the Voyager space probes were controlled by a version of the [RCA 1802](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RCA_1802 "RCA 1802") (RCA CDP1802 "COSMAC" [microprocessor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microprocessor "Microprocessor")), but such claims are not supported by the primary design documents. The CDP1802 microprocessor was used later in the [_Galileo_ space probe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_(spacecraft) "Galileo (spacecraft)"), which was designed and built years later. The digital control electronics of the Voyagers were not based on a microprocessor integrated-circuit chip.

The [uplink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uplink "Uplink") communications are executed via [S-band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-band "S-band")[microwave communications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave_communications "Microwave communications"). The [downlink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downlink "Downlink") communications are carried out by an [X-band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-band "X-band")[microwave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave "Microwave") transmitter on board the spacecraft, with an S-band transmitter as a back-up. All long-range communications to and from the two Voyagers have been carried out using their 3.7-meter (12 ft) high-gain antennas. The high-gain antenna has a beamwidth of 0.5° for X-band, and 2.3° for S-band.[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-Ludwig2002-46): 17  (The low-gain antenna has a 7 dB gain and 60° beamwidth.)[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-Ludwig2002-46): 17

Because of the [inverse-square law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse-square_law "Inverse-square law") in [radio communications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_communications "Radio communications"), the digital data rates used in the downlinks from the Voyagers have been continually decreasing the farther that they get from the Earth. For example, the data rate used from Jupiter was about 115,000 bits per second. That was halved at the distance of Saturn, and it has gone down continually since then.[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-Ludwig2002-46) Some measures were taken on the ground along the way to reduce the effects of the inverse-square law. In between 1982 and 1985, the diameters of the three main [parabolic dish antennas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabolic_dish_antenna "Parabolic dish antenna") of the [Deep Space Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Space_Network "Deep Space Network") were increased from 64 to 70 m (210 to 230 ft)[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-Ludwig2002-46): 34  dramatically increasing their areas for gathering weak microwave signals.

Whilst the craft were between Saturn and Uranus the onboard software was upgraded to do a degree of image compression and to use a more efficient [Reed-Solomon error-correcting encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed%E2%80%93Solomon_error_correction#Space_transmission "Reed–Solomon error correction").[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-Ludwig2002-46): 33

Then between 1986 and 1989, new techniques were brought into play to combine the signals from multiple antennas on the ground into one, more powerful signal, in a kind of an [antenna array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antenna_array_(electromagnetic) "Antenna array (electromagnetic)").[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-Ludwig2002-46): 34  This was done at [Goldstone, California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldstone,_California "Goldstone, California"), [Canberra (Australia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canberra_Deep_Space_Communication_Complex "Canberra Deep Space Communication Complex"), and [Madrid (Spain)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_Deep_Space_Communication_Complex "Madrid Deep Space Communication Complex") using the additional dish antennas available there. Also, in Australia, the [Parkes Radio Telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkes_Radio_Telescope "Parkes Radio Telescope") was brought into the array in time for the fly-by of Neptune in 1989. In the United States, the [Very Large Array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_Large_Array "Very Large Array") in [New Mexico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico "New Mexico") was brought into temporary use along with the antennas of the Deep Space Network at Goldstone.[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-Ludwig2002-46): 34  Using this new technology of antenna arrays helped to compensate for the immense radio distance from Neptune to the Earth.

[![Image 27](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/MHW-RTGs.gif/250px-MHW-RTGs.gif)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:MHW-RTGs.gif)

[RTGs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioisotope_thermoelectric_generator "Radioisotope thermoelectric generator") for the Voyager program

[Electrical power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power "Electric power") is supplied by three [MHW-RTG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MHW-RTG "MHW-RTG")[radioisotope thermoelectric generators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioisotope_thermoelectric_generator "Radioisotope thermoelectric generator") (RTGs). They are powered by [plutonium-238](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutonium-238 "Plutonium-238") (distinct from the [Pu-239](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutonium-239 "Plutonium-239") isotope used in nuclear weapons) and provided approximately 470 [W](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt "Watt") at 30 [volts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt "Volt")[DC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_current "Direct current") when the spacecraft was launched. Plutonium-238 decays with a [half-life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life "Half-life") of 87.74 years,[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-47) so RTGs using Pu-238 will lose a factor of 1−0.5(1/87.74) = 0.79% of their power output per year.

In 2011, 34 years after launch, the thermal power generated by such an RTG would be reduced to (1/2)(34/87.74) ≈ 76% of its initial power. The RTG [thermocouples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermocouple "Thermocouple"), which convert thermal power into electricity, also degrade over time reducing available electric power below this calculated level.

By 7 October 2011 the power generated by _Voyager 1_ and _Voyager 2_ had dropped to 267.9 W and 269.2 W respectively, about 57% of the power at launch. The level of power output was better than pre-launch predictions based on a conservative thermocouple degradation model. As the electrical power decreases, spacecraft loads must be turned off, eliminating some capabilities. There may be insufficient power for communications by 2032.[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-48)

Voyager Interstellar Mission
----------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Voyager_program&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Voyager Interstellar Mission")]

[![Image 28](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/PIA22835-VoyagerProgram%26Heliosphere-Chart-20181210.png/960px-PIA22835-VoyagerProgram%26Heliosphere-Chart-20181210.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:PIA22835-VoyagerProgram%26Heliosphere-Chart-20181210.png)

The Voyager primary mission was completed in 1989, with the close flyby of Neptune by _Voyager 2_. The Voyager Interstellar Mission (VIM) is a mission extension, which began when the two spacecraft had already been in flight for over 12 years.[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-50) The Heliophysics Division of the NASA Science Mission Directorate conducted a Heliophysics Senior Review in 2008. The panel found that the VIM "is a mission that is absolutely imperative to continue" and that VIM "funding near the optimal level and increased DSN ([Deep Space Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_Deep_Space_Network "NASA Deep Space Network")) support is warranted."[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-51)

The main objective of the VIM was to extend the exploration of the Solar System beyond the outer planets to the [heliopause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliosphere "Heliosphere") (the farthest extent at which the Sun's radiation predominates over interstellar winds) and if possible even beyond. Voyager 1 crossed the heliopause boundary in 2012, followed by Voyager 2 in 2018. Passing through the heliopause boundary has allowed both spacecraft to make measurements of the interstellar fields, particles and waves unaffected by the [solar wind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_wind "Solar wind"). Two significant findings so far have been the discovery of a region of magnetic bubbles[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-52) and no indication of an expected shift in the Solar magnetic field.[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-53)

The entire _Voyager 2_ scan platform, including all of the platform instruments, was switched off in 1998. All platform instruments on _Voyager 1_, except for the ultraviolet spectrometer (UVS)[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-54) have also been switched off.

The _Voyager 1_ scan platform was scheduled to go off-line in late 2000 but has been left on to investigate UV emission from the upwind direction. UVS data are still captured but scans are no longer possible.[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-55)

Gyro operations ended in 2016 for _Voyager 2_ and in 2017 for _Voyager 1_. Gyro operations are used to rotate the probe 360 degrees six times per year to measure the magnetic field of the spacecraft, which is then subtracted from the magnetometer science data.

On 14 November 2023, Voyager 1 stopped sending all telemetry and data, though the signal was still present. After months of experiments, made considerably more difficult by the 45 hour round trip time, the cause was traced to a bad memory chip. New software was written to avoid the bad memory block, and engineering data resumed on 20 April 2024.[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-56) Science data from two instruments resumed in May 2024,[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-57) and full recovery (of all science instruments that were still powered up) was in June 2024.[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-58) For more details of this intricate operation, see [Voyager 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_1 "Voyager 1").

The two spacecraft continue to operate, with some loss in subsystem redundancy but retain the capability to return scientific data from a full complement of Voyager Interstellar Mission (VIM) science instruments.

Both spacecraft also have adequate electrical power and attitude control propellant to continue operating and collecting science data through at least 2026.[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-59) Though additional science instruments may need to be turned off, the spacecraft are expected to be able to communicate until 2036, in the absence of additional failures.[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-60)

This diagram about the heliosphere was released on 28 June 2013 and incorporates results from the Voyager spacecraft.[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-61)

By the start of VIM, _Voyager 1_ was at a distance of 40 [AU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit "Astronomical unit") from the Earth, while _Voyager 2_ was at 31 AU. VIM is in three phases: termination shock, heliosheath exploration, and interstellar exploration phase. The spacecraft began VIM in an environment controlled by the Sun's magnetic field, with the plasma particles being dominated by those contained in the expanding supersonic solar wind. This is the characteristic environment of the termination shock phase. At some distance from the Sun, the supersonic solar wind will be held back from further expansion by the interstellar wind. The first feature encountered by a spacecraft as a result of this interaction – between interstellar wind and solar wind – was the termination shock, where the solar wind slows to subsonic speed, and large changes in plasma flow direction and magnetic field orientation occur. _Voyager 1_ completed the phase of termination shock in December 2004 at a distance of 94 AU, while _Voyager 2_ completed it in August 2007 at a distance of 84 AU. After entering into the heliosheath, the spacecraft were in an area that is dominated by the Sun's magnetic field and solar wind particles. After passing through the heliosheath, the two Voyagers began the phase of interstellar exploration. The outer boundary of the heliosheath is called the heliopause. This is the region where the Sun's influence begins to decrease and interstellar space can be detected.[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-62)

_Voyager 1_ is escaping the Solar System at the speed of 3.6 AU per year 35° north of the [ecliptic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecliptic "Ecliptic") in the general direction of the [solar apex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_apex "Solar apex") in [Hercules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hercules_(constellation) "Hercules (constellation)"), while _Voyager 2_'s speed is about 3.3 AU per year, heading 48° south of the ecliptic. The Voyager spacecraft will eventually go on to the stars. In about [40,000 years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_far_future#Spacecraft_and_space_exploration "Timeline of the far future"), _Voyager 1_ will be within 1.6 [light years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-year "Light-year") (ly) of AC+79 3888, also known as [Gliese 445](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gliese_445 "Gliese 445"), which is approaching the Sun. In 40,000 years _Voyager 2_ will be within 1.7 ly of [Ross 248](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_248 "Ross 248") (another star which is approaching the Sun), and in [296,000 years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_far_future#Spacecreaft_and_space_exploration "Timeline of the far future") it will pass within 4.6 ly of [Sirius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirius "Sirius"), which is the brightest star in the night-sky.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-JPL.NASA-2) The spacecraft are not expected to collide with a star for 1 sextillion (10 20) years.[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-lavender-63)

In October 2020, astronomers reported a significant unexpected increase in density in the [space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_space "Outer space") beyond the [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System "Solar System"), as detected by the Voyager [space probes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_probe "Space probe"). According to the researchers, this implies that "the density gradient is a large-scale feature of the [VLISM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_medium#Structures "Interstellar medium") (very local [interstellar medium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_medium "Interstellar medium")) in the general direction of the [heliospheric nose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliosphere#Edge_structure "Heliosphere")".[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-SA-20201019-64)[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-AJL-20200825-65)

Both spacecraft carry a 12-inch (30 cm) golden phonograph record that contains pictures and sounds of Earth, symbolic directions on the cover for playing the record, and data detailing the location of Earth.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-NYT-20170905-33)[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-Ferris-201205-29) The record is intended as a combination [time capsule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_capsule "Time capsule") and an interstellar message to any civilization, alien or far-future human, that may recover either of the Voyagers. The contents of this record were selected by a committee that included [Timothy Ferris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Ferris "Timothy Ferris") and was chaired by [Carl Sagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan "Carl Sagan").[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-Ferris-201205-29)

Seen from 6 billion kilometers (3.7 billion miles), Earth appears as a "[pale blue dot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale_blue_dot "Pale blue dot")" (the blueish-white speck approximately halfway down the light band to the right).

_Pale Blue Dot_ is a photograph of [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth") taken on February 14, 1990, by the _[Voyager 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager\_1 "Voyager 1")_[space probe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_probe "Space probe") from a distance of approximately 6 billion kilometers (3.7 billion miles, 40.5 [AU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit "Astronomical unit")), as part of that day's [_Family Portrait_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Portrait_(Voyager) "Family Portrait (Voyager)") series of images of the [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System "Solar System").[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-NASA-20200212-66) The Voyager program's discoveries during the primary phase of its mission, including new close-up color photos of the major planets, were regularly documented by print and electronic media outlets. Among the best-known of these is an image of the Earth as a _[Pale Blue Dot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale\_Blue\_Dot "Pale Blue Dot")_, taken in 1990 by _Voyager 1_, and popularized by Carl Sagan,[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program#cite_note-67)

> Consider again that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us....The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena.... To my mind, there is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly and compassionately with one another and to preserve and cherish that pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.
