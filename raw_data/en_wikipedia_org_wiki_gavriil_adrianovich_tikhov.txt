Gavriil Adrianovich Tikhov Гавриил Адрианович Тихов Gavriil Tikhov with his wife at Pulkovo Observatory in 1912 Born ( 1875-05-01 ) May 1, 1875 Smolevichi , Minsk Governorate , Russian Empire Died January 25, 1960 (1960-01-25) (aged 84) Almaty , Kazakh SSR , Soviet Union Occupation Astronomer Gavriil Adrianovich Tikhov ( Russian : Гавриил Адрианович Тихов , 1 May 1875 – 25 January 1960) was a Soviet astronomer who was a pioneer in astrobiology and is considered to be the father of astrobotany . He worked as an observer at the Pulkovo Observatory from 1906 until 1941. After undertaking an expedition to Alma-Ata to observe the solar eclipse of September 21, 1941 , he remained and became one of the founders of the Kamenskoe Plateau Observatory , the Fesenkov Astrophysical Institute , and the Kazakhstan Academy of Sciences .

[ 1 ] G. A. Tikhov was born in Smolevichy, near Minsk , in the family of a railway employee, the family often moved from place to place. He began to study at the gymnasium of Pavlodar , and completed secondary education at the Simferopol gymnasium . Living in Simferopol , he once saw two bright stars in the clear evening sky. He learned from the teacher of the Simferopol gymnasium that these stars are the planet Venus and the star Sirius . At the Simferopol Public Library, he read two astronomical books. "I read these books with exciting interest, and my fate was decided. In the spring of 1892 I will never forget - then I irrevocably decided to become an astronomer," he writes in his memoir, 60 Years Near the Telescope . At the gymnasium observatory, he first looked through a telescope.

[ 2 ] Tikhov invented the feathering spectrograph by using the commonly occurring chromatic aberration to his advantage. By installing a ring-shaped diaphragm in front of the objective he enabled an observer to deduce the color and spectral class of a star very easily. He was one of the first to use color filters to increase the contrast of surface details on planets . He was appointed head of astrobotany in Alma-Ata, and investigated the possibility of life on other bodies in the Solar System .

The crater Tikhov crater on the Moon , the Martian crater Tikhov , and the asteroid 2251 Tikhov are named in his honor.

[ 1 ] In popular culture [ edit ] In the episode 5, season 3 of Star Trek: Discovery 'Die Trying', a botanical repository starship is named Tikhov .
