Acoustic noise may mar aesthetic experience, such as attending a concert hall. It may also be a medical issue inherent in the biology of hearing.

In technology, noise is unwanted signals in a device or apparatus, commonly of an electrical nature. The nature of noise is much studied in mathematics and is a prominent topic in statistics .

This article provides a survey of specific topics linked to their primary articles.

Acoustic noise [ edit ] Main article: Noise In transportation [ edit ] Aircraft noise Jet noise , caused by high-velocity jets and turbulent eddies Noise and vibration on maritime vessels Noise, vibration, and harshness , quality criteria for vehicles Traffic noise, including roadway noise and train noise Other acoustic noise [ edit ] Artificial noise , in spectator sports Background noise , in acoustics, any sound other than the monitored one Comfort noise , used in telecommunications to fill silent gaps Grey noise , random noise with a psychoacoustic adjusted spectrum Industrial noise , relevant to hearing damage and industrial hygiene Noise pollution , that affects negatively the quality of life Noise in biology [ edit ] Cellular noise , in biology, random variability between cells Developmental noise , variations among living beings with the same genome Neuronal noise , in neuroscience Synaptic noise , in neuroscience Transcriptional noise , in biochemistry, errors in genetic transcription Noise in computer graphics [ edit ] Noise in computer graphics refers to various pseudo-random functions used to create textures, including: Gradient noise , created by interpolation of a lattice of pseudorandom gradients Perlin noise , a type of gradient noise developed in 1983 Simplex noise , a method for constructing an n -dimensional noise function comparable to Perlin noise Simulation noise , a function that creates a divergence-free field Value noise , created by interpolation of a lattice of pseudorandom values; differs from gradient noise Wavelet noise , an alternative to Perlin noise which reduces problems of aliasing and detail loss Worley noise , a noise function introduced by Steven Worley in 1996 Noise in electronics and radio [ edit ] Noise (signal processing) , various types of interference Noise (electronics) , related to electronic circuitry Ground noise , appearing at the ground terminal of audio equipment Image noise , related to digital photography Noise (radio) , interference related to radio signals Atmospheric noise , radio noise caused by lightning Cosmic noise , radio noise from outside the Earth's atmosphere Noise (video) , "snow" on video or television pictures Noise in mathematics [ edit ] Any one of many statistical types or colors of noise , such as White noise , which has constant power spectral density Gaussian noise , with a probability density function equal to that of the normal distribution Pink noise , with spectral density inversely proportional to frequency Brownian noise or "brown" noise, with spectral density inversely proportional to the square of frequency Pseudorandom noise , in cryptography, artificial signal that can pass for random Statistical noise , a colloquialism for recognized amounts of unexplained variation in a sample Shot noise , noise which can be modeled by a Poisson process Noise-based logic , where logic values are different stochastic processes Noise print , a statistical signature of ambient noise, used in its suppression Other types of noise [ edit ] Electrochemical noise , electrical fluctuations in electrolysis, corrosion, etc.

Phonon noise , in materials science Seismic noise , random tremors of the ground Measures of noise intensity [ edit ] Noise figure , the ratio of the output noise power to attributable thermal noise Ambient noise level , the background sound pressure level at a given location Noise power , with several related meanings Noise spectral density , N o measured in Watt/Hertz Noise temperature , temperature that would produce equivalent semiconductor noise See also [ edit ] Noise (disambiguation) Index of articles associated with the same name This set index article includes a list of related items that share the same name (or similar names).
