[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Random measures are for example used in the theory of random processes , where they form many important point processes such as Poisson point processes and Cox processes .

Definition [ edit ] Random measures can be defined as transition kernels or as random elements . Both definitions are equivalent. For the definitions, let E {\displaystyle E} be a separable complete metric space and let E {\displaystyle {\mathcal {E}}} be its Borel σ σ {\displaystyle \sigma } -algebra . (The most common example of a separable complete metric space is R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} .) As a transition kernel [ edit ] A random measure ζ ζ {\displaystyle \zeta } is a ( a.s.

) locally finite transition kernel from an abstract probability space ( Ω Ω , A , P ) {\displaystyle (\Omega ,{\mathcal {A}},P)} to ( E , E ) {\displaystyle (E,{\mathcal {E}})} .

[ 3 ] Being a transition kernel means that For any fixed B ∈ ∈ E {\displaystyle B\in {\mathcal {\mathcal {E}}}} , the mapping ω ω ↦ ↦ ζ ζ ( ω ω , B ) {\displaystyle \omega \mapsto \zeta (\omega ,B)} is measurable from ( Ω Ω , A ) {\displaystyle (\Omega ,{\mathcal {A}})} to ( R , B ( R ) ) {\displaystyle (\mathbb {R} ,{\mathcal {B}}(\mathbb {R} ))} For every fixed ω ω ∈ ∈ Ω Ω {\displaystyle \omega \in \Omega } , the mapping B ↦ ↦ ζ ζ ( ω ω , B ) ( B ∈ ∈ E ) {\displaystyle B\mapsto \zeta (\omega ,B)\quad (B\in {\mathcal {E}})} is a measure on ( E , E ) {\displaystyle (E,{\mathcal {E}})} Being locally finite means that the measures B ↦ ↦ ζ ζ ( ω ω , B ) {\displaystyle B\mapsto \zeta (\omega ,B)} satisfy ζ ζ ( ω ω , B ~ ~ ) < ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \zeta (\omega ,{\tilde {B}})<\infty } for all bounded measurable sets B ~ ~ ∈ ∈ E {\displaystyle {\tilde {B}}\in {\mathcal {E}}} and for all ω ω ∈ ∈ Ω Ω {\displaystyle \omega \in \Omega } except some P {\displaystyle P} - null set In the context of stochastic processes there is the related concept of a stochastic kernel, probability kernel, Markov kernel .

As a random element [ edit ] Define M ~ ~ := { μ μ ∣ ∣ μ μ is measure on ( E , E ) } {\displaystyle {\tilde {\mathcal {M}}}:=\{\mu \mid \mu {\text{ is measure on }}(E,{\mathcal {E}})\}} and the subset of locally finite measures by M := { μ μ ∈ ∈ M ~ ~ ∣ ∣ μ μ ( B ~ ~ ) < ∞ ∞ for all bounded measurable B ~ ~ ∈ ∈ E } {\displaystyle {\mathcal {M}}:=\{\mu \in {\tilde {\mathcal {M}}}\mid \mu ({\tilde {B}})<\infty {\text{ for all bounded measurable }}{\tilde {B}}\in {\mathcal {E}}\}} For all bounded measurable B ~ ~ {\displaystyle {\tilde {B}}} , define the mappings I B ~ ~ : : μ μ ↦ ↦ μ μ ( B ~ ~ ) {\displaystyle I_{\tilde {B}}\colon \mu \mapsto \mu ({\tilde {B}})} from M ~ ~ {\displaystyle {\tilde {\mathcal {M}}}} to R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } . Let M ~ ~ {\displaystyle {\tilde {\mathbb {M} }}} be the σ σ {\displaystyle \sigma } -algebra induced by the mappings I B ~ ~ {\displaystyle I_{\tilde {B}}} on M ~ ~ {\displaystyle {\tilde {\mathcal {M}}}} and M {\displaystyle \mathbb {M} } the σ σ {\displaystyle \sigma } -algebra induced by the mappings I B ~ ~ {\displaystyle I_{\tilde {B}}} on M {\displaystyle {\mathcal {M}}} . Note that M ~ ~ | M = M {\displaystyle {\tilde {\mathbb {M} }}|_{\mathcal {M}}=\mathbb {M} } .

A random measure is a random element from ( Ω Ω , A , P ) {\displaystyle (\Omega ,{\mathcal {A}},P)} to ( M ~ ~ , M ~ ~ ) {\displaystyle ({\tilde {\mathcal {M}}},{\tilde {\mathbb {M} }})} that almost surely takes values in ( M , M ) {\displaystyle ({\mathcal {M}},\mathbb {M} )} [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Basic related concepts [ edit ] Intensity measure [ edit ] Main article: intensity measure For a random measure ζ ζ {\displaystyle \zeta } , the measure E ⁡ ⁡ ζ ζ {\displaystyle \operatorname {E} \zeta } satisfying E ⁡ ⁡ [ ∫ ∫ f ( x ) ζ ζ ( d x ) ] = ∫ ∫ f ( x ) E ⁡ ⁡ ζ ζ ( d x ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {E} \left[\int f(x)\;\zeta (\mathrm {d} x)\right]=\int f(x)\;\operatorname {E} \zeta (\mathrm {d} x)} for every positive measurable function f {\displaystyle f} is called the intensity measure of ζ ζ {\displaystyle \zeta } . The intensity measure exists for every random measure and is a s-finite measure .

Supporting measure [ edit ] For a random measure ζ ζ {\displaystyle \zeta } , the measure ν ν {\displaystyle \nu } satisfying ∫ ∫ f ( x ) ζ ζ ( d x ) = 0 a.s.

iff ∫ ∫ f ( x ) ν ν ( d x ) = 0 {\displaystyle \int f(x)\;\zeta (\mathrm {d} x)=0{\text{ a.s. }}{\text{ iff }}\int f(x)\;\nu (\mathrm {d} x)=0} for all positive measurable functions is called the supporting measure of ζ ζ {\displaystyle \zeta } . The supporting measure exists for all random measures and can be chosen to be finite.

Laplace transform [ edit ] For a random measure ζ ζ {\displaystyle \zeta } , the Laplace transform is defined as L ζ ζ ( f ) = E ⁡ ⁡ [ exp ⁡ ⁡ ( − − ∫ ∫ f ( x ) ζ ζ ( d x ) ) ] {\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}_{\zeta }(f)=\operatorname {E} \left[\exp \left(-\int f(x)\;\zeta (\mathrm {d} x)\right)\right]} for every positive measurable function f {\displaystyle f} .

Basic properties [ edit ] Measurability of integrals [ edit ] For a random measure ζ ζ {\displaystyle \zeta } , the integrals ∫ ∫ f ( x ) ζ ζ ( d x ) {\displaystyle \int f(x)\zeta (\mathrm {d} x)} and ζ ζ ( A ) := ∫ ∫ 1 A ( x ) ζ ζ ( d x ) {\displaystyle \zeta (A):=\int \mathbf {1} _{A}(x)\zeta (\mathrm {d} x)} for positive E {\displaystyle {\mathcal {E}}} -measurable f {\displaystyle f} are measurable, so they are random variables .

Uniqueness [ edit ] The distribution of a random measure is uniquely determined by the distributions of ∫ ∫ f ( x ) ζ ζ ( d x ) {\displaystyle \int f(x)\zeta (\mathrm {d} x)} for all continuous functions with compact support f {\displaystyle f} on E {\displaystyle E} . For a fixed semiring I ⊂ ⊂ E {\displaystyle {\mathcal {I}}\subset {\mathcal {E}}} that generates E {\displaystyle {\mathcal {E}}} in the sense that σ σ ( I ) = E {\displaystyle \sigma ({\mathcal {I}})={\mathcal {E}}} , the distribution of a random measure is also uniquely determined by the integral over all positive simple I {\displaystyle {\mathcal {I}}} -measurable functions f {\displaystyle f} .

[ 6 ] Decomposition [ edit ] A measure generally might be decomposed as: μ μ = μ μ d + μ μ a = μ μ d + ∑ ∑ n = 1 N κ κ n δ δ X n , {\displaystyle \mu =\mu _{d}+\mu _{a}=\mu _{d}+\sum _{n=1}^{N}\kappa _{n}\delta _{X_{n}},} Here μ μ d {\displaystyle \mu _{d}} is a diffuse measure without atoms, while μ μ a {\displaystyle \mu _{a}} is a purely atomic measure.

Random counting measure [ edit ] A random measure of the form: μ μ = ∑ ∑ n = 1 N δ δ X n , {\displaystyle \mu =\sum _{n=1}^{N}\delta _{X_{n}},} where δ δ {\displaystyle \delta } is the Dirac measure and X n {\displaystyle X_{n}} are random variables, is called a point process [ 1 ] [ 2 ] or random counting measure . This random measure describes the set of N particles, whose locations are given  by the (generally vector valued) random variables X n {\displaystyle X_{n}} . The diffuse component μ μ d {\displaystyle \mu _{d}} is null for a counting measure.

In the formal notation of above a random counting measure is a map from a probability space to the measurable space ( N X {\displaystyle N_{X}} , B ( N X ) {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {B}}(N_{X})} ) . Here N X {\displaystyle N_{X}} is the space of all boundedly finite integer-valued measures N ∈ ∈ M X {\displaystyle N\in M_{X}} (called counting measures ).

The definitions of expectation measure, Laplace functional, moment measures and stationarity for random measures follow those of point processes . Random measures are useful in the description and analysis of Monte Carlo methods , such as Monte Carlo numerical quadrature and particle filters .
