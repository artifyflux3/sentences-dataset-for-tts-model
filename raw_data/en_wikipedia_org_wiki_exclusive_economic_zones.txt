The world's exclusive economic zones by boundary types and EEZ types An exclusive economic zone ( EEZ ), as prescribed by the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea , is an area of the sea in which a sovereign state has exclusive rights regarding the exploration and use of marine resources , including energy production from water and wind.

[ 1 ] It stretches from the outer limit of the territorial sea (22.224 kilometres or 12 nautical miles from the baseline) out 370.4 kilometres (or 200 nautical miles) from the coast of the state in question. It is also referred to as a maritime continental margin and, in colloquial usage, may include the continental shelf . The term does not include either the territorial sea or the continental shelf beyond the 200 nautical mile limit. The difference between the territorial sea and the exclusive economic zone is that the first confers full sovereignty over the waters, whereas the second is merely a "sovereign right" which refers to the coastal state's rights below the surface of the sea. The surface waters are international waters .

[ 2 ] Definition [ edit ] Maritime Zones under International Law Generally, a state's exclusive economic zone is an area beyond and adjacent to the territorial sea, extending seaward to a distance of no more than 200 nmi (370 km) out from its coastal baseline .

[ 3 ] The exception to this rule occurs when exclusive economic zones would overlap; that is, state coastal baselines are less than 400 nmi (741 km) apart. When an overlap occurs, it is up to the states to delineate the actual maritime boundary .

[ 4 ] Generally, any point within an overlapping area defaults to the nearest state.

[ 5 ] The exclusive economic zone stretches much further into sea than the territorial waters , which end at 12 nmi (22 km) from the coastal baseline (if following the rules set out in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea ).

[ 5 ] Thus, the exclusive economic zones includes the contiguous zone .

States also have rights to the seabed of what is called the extended continental shelf up to 350 nmi (648 km) from the coastal baseline, beyond the exclusive economic zones, but such areas are not part of their exclusive economic zones.

The legal definition of the continental shelf does not correspond exactly to the geological meaning of the term, as it also includes the continental rise and slope, and the entire seabed within the exclusive economic zone.

Origin and history [ edit ] The idea of allotting nations' EEZs to give them more control of maritime affairs outside territorial limits gained acceptance in the late 20th century.

Initially, a country's sovereign territorial waters extended 3 nmi (6 km) (range of cannon shot) beyond the shore.

[ citation needed ] In modern times, a country's sovereign territorial waters extend to 12 nmi (22 km) beyond the shore.

[ citation needed ] One of the first assertions of exclusive jurisdiction beyond the traditional territorial seas was made by the United States in the Truman Proclamation of 28 September 1945. However, it was Chile and Peru respectively that first claimed maritime zones of 200 nautical miles with the Presidential Declaration Concerning Continental Shelf signed by Chilean President Gabriel Gonzalez Videla on 23 June 1947 [ 6 ] and by Peruvian President Jose Luis Bustamante y Rivero through Presidential  Decree No. 781 of 1 August 1947 [ 7 ] [ 8 ] It was not until 1982 with the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea that the 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone was formally adopted.

Disputes [ edit ] This section needs to be updated .

Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information.

( June 2020 ) The exact extent of exclusive economic zones is a common source of conflicts between states over marine waters.

Unresolved [ edit ] Arctic Ocean [ edit ] A wedge-shaped section of the Beaufort Sea , an area that reportedly contains substantial oil reserves , is disputed between Canada and the United States.

Atlantic Ocean [ edit ] Several countries, Denmark, Iceland, Ireland, and the United Kingdom have competing claims to the continental shelf near Rockall , an uninhabitable rock located in the EEZ of the United Kingdom. In addition, since Brexit the United Kingdom has claimed an 12 nautical miles (22 km) exclusion zone around Rockall, which Ireland does not recognise.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] Caribbean Sea [ edit ] In 1996, the Dominican Republic and United Kingdom signed an agreement establishing a simplified equidistance boundary between the British Overseas Territory of Turks and Caicos and the Dominican Republic.

Mouchoir Bank fell on the Turks and Caicos side of the boundary, and Silver and Navidad Banks on the Dominican Republic side. However, the agreement was not subsequently ratified by either party. Instead, the Dominican Republic declared itself an archipelagic state in 2007, claiming sovereignty over Mouchoir Bank and extending its EEZ beyond the boundary agreement with the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom does not accept the archipelagic status and maritime boundaries claimed by the Dominican Republic.

[ 12 ] Since 2007, the Dominican Republic in Hispaniola considers itself an archipelagic state , encroaching the long-established median or equidistance line dividing the EEZ of the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico , and claiming portion of the EEZ claimed by the United States in relation to the archipelago of Puerto Rico , itself an unincorporated U.S. territory .

[ 13 ] [ 14 ] The United States does not accept the archipelagic status and maritime boundaries claimed by the Dominican Republic.

[ 15 ] Victor Prescott , an authority in the field of maritime boundaries , argues that, as the coasts of both states are short coastlines with few offshore islands, an equidistance line is appropriate.

[ 16 ] Indian Ocean [ edit ] Mauritius claims an EEZ for Tromelin Island from France and an EEZ in respect of the British Indian Ocean Territory from the UK. An Exclusive Economic Zone covering 2.3 million square kilometres is claimed by Mauritius.

Mediterranean Sea [ edit ] Croatia's ZERP ( Ecological and Fisheries Protection Zone ) in the Adriatic Sea caused friction with Italy and Slovenia, and caused problems during the accession of Croatia to the European Union .

Turkey claims a portion of Cyprus's claimed EEZ based on Turkey's definition that no islands, including Cyprus, can have a full EEZ [ 17 ] [ 18 ] and should only be entitled to 12 nautical miles. Furthermore, the internationally unrecognized Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) also claims portions of Cyprus's claimed EEZ. Turkey also disputes Greece's EEZ for the same reason in regards to its islands in the Aegean Sea . Turkey is one of few countries to not have signed UNCLOS .

Greece claims that the maritime deal between the internationally recognized GNA government of Libya and Turkey is illegal and it signed a counter agreement with Egypt.

[ 19 ] Lebanon claims that the agreement between Cyprus and Israel overlapped its own EEZ.

Pacific Ocean [ edit ] De facto territories in the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea The South China Sea is the setting for several ongoing disputes between regional powers including China, Taiwan, Vietnam, the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei.

Japan claims an EEZ around Okinotorishima , but this is disputed by China, Taiwan, and South Korea, who claim it is an islet which is incapable of generating an EEZ.

China and South Korea debates over the boundaries of EEZs in the East China Sea and Yellow Sea, including Socotra Rock , a source for territorial dispute .

Potential [ edit ] Regions where a permanent ice shelf extends beyond the coastline are also a source of potential dispute.

[ 20 ] Resolved [ edit ] The Cod Wars between the United Kingdom and Iceland occurred periodically over many decades until they were resolved with a final agreement in 1976.

In 1992, the Canada–France Maritime Boundary Case , which centred on the EEZ around the French islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, was decided by an arbitral tribunal that concurred on the whole with the arguments put forth by Canada. France was awarded 18% of the area it had originally claimed.

In 1999, following the Hanish Islands conflict , the Permanent Court of Arbitration ruled that the EEZs of Yemen and Eritrea should be demarcated equidistantly between the mainlands of the two nations, without taking account of sovereignty over the islands.

[ 21 ] [ 22 ] In 2009, in a dispute between Romania and Ukraine over Snake Island , the UN International Court of Justice decided that Snake Island has no EEZ beyond 12 nautical miles of its own land.

[ 23 ] In 2010, a dispute between Norway and Russia about both territorial waters and EEZ with regard to the Svalbard archipelago as it affects Russia's EEZ due to its unique treaty status was resolved. A treaty was agreed in principle in April 2010 between the two states and subsequently officially ratified, resolving this demarcation dispute.

[ 24 ] The agreement was signed in Murmansk on 15 September 2010.

[ 25 ] In 2014, the Netherlands and Germany resolved an old border dispute regarding the exact location of the border in the Dollart Bay.

[ 26 ] [ 27 ] Transboundary stocks [ edit ] See also: Highly migratory species Fisheries management , usually adhering to guidelines set by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), provides significant practical mechanisms for the control of EEZs. Transboundary fish stocks are an important concept in this control.

[ 28 ] Transboundary stocks are fish stocks that range in the EEZs of at least two countries.

Straddling stocks , on the other hand, range both within an EEZ as well as in the high seas , outside any EEZ. A stock can be both transboundary and straddling.

[ 29 ] By region or country [ edit ] Region [ edit ] Caribbean Sea [ edit ] EEZs in the Caribbean Sea Atlantic and Indian Oceans [ edit ] EEZs in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans Pacific Ocean [ edit ] EEZs in the Pacific Ocean Country [ edit ] Algeria [ edit ] Algeria on 17 April 2018 established an exclusive economic zone (EEZ) off its coasts by Presidential Decree No. 18-96 of 2 Rajab 1439 corresponding to 20 March 2018.

[ 30 ] [ 31 ] The permanent mission of Spain to the United Nations on 27 July 2018 declared its disagreement with the EEZ announced by Algeria and that the government of Spain indicated its willingness to enter into negotiations with the government of Algeria with a view to reaching a mutually acceptable agreement on the outer limits of their respective exclusive economic zones, [ 32 ] The same was done by the Italian mission on 28 November 2018.

[ 33 ] The two countries indicated that the Algerian measure had been taken unilaterally and without consulting them.

On 25 November 2018, the Algerian Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent an oral note in response to the Spanish protest, explaining that the Algerian government does not recognize the largely exorbitant coordinates contained in Royal Decree 236/2013, which overlap with the coordinates of Presidential Decree n° 18–96 establishing an exclusive economic zone off the coast of Algeria. The Algerian government wished to emphasize that the unilateral delimitation carried out by Spain is not in conformity with the letter of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and has not taken into consideration the configuration, the specific characteristics, and the special circumstances of the Mediterranean Sea, in particular for the case of the two countries whose coasts are located face to face, as well as the objective rules and relevant principles of international law to govern the equitable delimitation of the maritime areas between Algeria and Spain, in accordance with article 74 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Algeria expressed its willingness to negotiate for a just solution.

[ 34 ] On 20 June 2019, a communication from Algeria was sent. It was addressed to the Italian embassy [ 35 ] and the Spanish embassy in Algiers [ 36 ] to show their eligibility in Algeria's exclusive economic zone.

Argentina [ edit ] Argentina 's exclusive economic zones, including its territorial claims (the Falklands and South Georgia, etc. plus its Antarctic claim) Considering the maritime areas claimed, the total area of Argentina reaches 3,849,756 km 2 . The recognized Argentine EEZ area is 1,159,063 km 2 .

Australia [ edit ] Main article: Exclusive economic zone of Australia Australia's exclusive economic zones, including its Antarctic claim Australia's exclusive economic zone was declared on 1 August 1994, and extends from 12 to 200 nautical miles from the coastline of Australia and its external territories , except where a maritime delimitation agreement exists with another state.

[ 37 ] [ 38 ] To the 12 nautical miles boundary is Australia's territorial waters . Australia has the third largest exclusive economic zone, behind France and the United States, but ahead of Russia, with a total area of 8,148,250 square kilometres, which actually exceeds its land territory.

The United Nations Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (CLCS) confirmed, in April 2008, Australia's rights over an additional 2.5 million square kilometres of seabed beyond the limits of Australia's EEZ.

[ 39 ] [ 40 ] Australia also claimed, in its submission to the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf, additional Continental Shelf past its EEZ from the Australian Antarctic Territory , [ 41 ] but these claims were deferred on Australia's request. However, Australia's EEZ from its Antarctic Territory is approximately 2 million square kilometres.

[ clarification needed ] Croatia [ edit ] Croatia's exclusive economic zone (dark blue) and Ecological and Fisheries Protection Zone Croatia proclaimed Ecological and Fisheries Protection Zone in 2003, but it was not enforced toward other European Union states especially Italy and Slovenia. The zone was upgraded to EEZ in 2021 together with Italy and Slovenia.

[ 48 ] [ 49 ] Territorial waters has 18,981 km 2 , while internal waters located within the baseline cover an additional 12,498 km 2 , and EEZ covers 24,482 km 2 for a total of 55,961 km 2 .

Cyprus [ edit ] Cyprus EEZ covers 98,707 square km (38,100 square miles). Cyprus' EEZ borders those of Greece , Turkey , Syria , Lebanon , Israel and Egypt .

[ 51 ] The EEZ of France covers approximately 7% of the total surface of all the EEZs of the world, whereas the land area of the French Republic is only 0.45% of the total land area of Earth.

Germany [ edit ] Main article: Exclusive economic zone of Germany Germany declared the establishment of its exclusive economic zone in the North and Baltic Seas on 1 January 1995.

[ 52 ] The relevant German legal provisions that are applicable within the EEZ  include the Maritime Task Act (Seeaufgabengesetz) from 1965, the Maritime Facilities Act (Seeanlagengesetz) from 2017, and prior to that the Sea Facilities Ordinance (Seeanlagenverordnung) from 1997, the Federal Mining Act (Bundesberggesetz) and the Regional Planning Act (Raumordnungsgesetz).

The German EEZ has an area of 32,982 km 2 . About   70% of the EEZ covers  Germany's entire North Sea area, while some 29% encompasses the Baltic Sea area.

[ 53 ] Greece [ edit ] Main article: Exclusive economic zone of Greece Exclusive Economic Zone of Greece Greece forms the southernmost part of the Balkan peninsula in the Mediterranean Sea . It includes many small islands which vary between 1,200 and 6,000 in the Aegean Sea and the Ionian Sea .

[ 54 ] The largest islands are Crete , Euboea , Lesbos , Rhodes and Chios .

Greece's EEZ is bordered to the west by Albania and Italy , to the south by Libya and Egypt , and to the east by Cyprus and Turkey .

[ 56 ] Indonesia [ edit ] Indonesia 's exclusive economic zone Main article: Exclusive economic zone of Indonesia Indonesia has the 6th largest exclusive economic zone in the world. The total size is 6,159,032 km 2 (2,378,016 sq mi). It claims an EEZ of 200 nautical miles from its shores. This is due to the 13,466 islands of the Indonesian Archipelago .

[ 57 ] It has the 2nd largest coastline of 54,720 km (34,000 mi). The five main islands are: Sumatra , Java , Borneo , Sulawesi , and Western New Guinea . There are two major island groups ( Nusa Tenggara and the Maluku Islands ) and sixty smaller island groups.

Ireland [ edit ] Since independence, Ireland's territorial waters were limited to 3 nautical miles (5.6 km).

[ 58 ] In 1964, her territorial waters were extended to 12 nautical miles (22 km) from the baseline covering an area of 41,000 km 2 (16,000 sq mi), [ 59 ] although several European countries retained fishing rights between 6–12 nautical miles (11–22 km).

[ 60 ] [ 61 ] In 1976, Ireland's exclusive economic zone was extended out to 200 nautical miles (370 km), increasing her maritime area to 450,000 km 2 (170,000 sq mi).

[ 62 ] [ 63 ] [ 64 ] In 1996, Ireland ratified the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) which allows her to claim the continental shelf out to 350 nautical miles (650 km) from the baseline.

[ 65 ] Ireland has made claims under UNCLOS for the Porcupine Abyssal Plain in 2005, the seabed of the Celtic Sea and Bay of Biscay in 2006, and also the Hatton Rockall area in 2009.

[ 66 ] She was awarded the Porcupine Abyssal claim in 2007 adding 39,000 km 2 (15,000 sq mi) of seabed to the State's continental shelf.

[ 67 ] The other two claims are still under discussion with neighbouring states; the Celtic Sea and Bay of Biscay with France, Spain and the United Kingdom; and the Hatton Rockall area with Denmark, Iceland and the United Kingdom.
In 2006, Ireland claimed her contiguous zone out to 24 nautical miles (44 km) from the baseline.

[ 68 ] Israel [ edit ] In 2010, an agreement was signed with Cyprus concerning the limit of territorial waters between Israel and Cyprus at the maritime halfway point, a clarification essential for safeguarding Israel's rights to oil and underwater gas reservoirs. The agreement was signed in Nicosia by Israeli Infrastructure Minister Uzi Landau and the Cypriot Foreign Minister Markos Kyprianou. The two countries agreed to cooperate in the development of any cross-border resources discovered and to negotiate an agreement on dividing joint resources.

Italy [ edit ] Main article: Exclusive economic zone of Italy Italy's EEZ in the Mediterranean Sea Italy has an EEZ of 541,915 km 2 (209,235 sq mi).

[ 55 ] The country claims an EEZ of 200 nautical miles from its shores, and its three coastlines are the Tyrrhenian Sea to the west, the Ionian Sea to the south and the Adriatic Sea to the east. Italy's EEZ is limited by maritime boundaries with neighboring countries to the northwest, east and southeast.

Italy's western sea territory stretches from the west coast of Italy on the Tyrrhenian Sea , including the island of Sardinia . The island of Sicily is in the southernmost area.

Lampedusa , a tiny island in the Mediterranean Sea, is the country's southernmost point. Italy shares treaty-defined maritime boundaries with France , Spain , Algeria , Tunisia , Libya , Malta , Greece , Albania , Montenegro , Croatia and Slovenia .

Japan [ edit ] Main article: Exclusive economic zone of Japan Japan's exclusive economic zones: Japan's EEZ Joint regime [ clarification needed ] with the Republic of Korea EEZ claimed by Japan, disputed by others Japan has the world's eighth-largest exclusive economic zone, covering 4,479,674 km 2 (1,729,612 sq mi).

[ 69 ] It claims an EEZ of 200 nautical miles from its shores.

The above, and relevant maps at the Sea Around Us Project [ 70 ] [ 71 ] [ 72 ] both indicate Japan's claimed boundaries, and do not take into account the claims of adjacent jurisdictions.

Japan also refers to various categories of "shipping area" – Smooth Water Area, Coasting Area, Major or Greater Coasting Area, Ocean Going Area – but it is unclear whether these are intended to have any territorial or economic implications.

Malaysia [ edit ] Main article: Exclusive economic zone of Malaysia Mexico [ edit ] Main article: Exclusive economic zone of Mexico Exclusive economic zone of Mexico Mexico's exclusive economic zones cover a total surface area of 3,269,386 km 2 , [ 55 ] and places Mexico among the countries with the largest areas in the world.

Myanmar [ edit ] Main article: Exclusive economic zone of Myanmar New Zealand [ edit ] Exclusive economic zones of the Realm of New Zealand , including the Ross Dependency (shaded) Main article: Exclusive economic zone of New Zealand New Zealand 's EEZ covers 4,083,744 km 2 (1,576,742 sq mi), [ 73 ] [ 74 ] which is approximately fifteen times the land area of the country. Sources vary significantly on the size of New Zealand's EEZ; for example, a recent government publication gave the area as roughly 4,300,000 km 2 .

[ 75 ] These figures are for the EEZ of New Zealand proper, and do not include the EEZs of other territories in the Realm of New Zealand (the Cook Islands , Niue , Tokelau , and the Ross Dependency ).

North Korea [ edit ] Main article: Exclusive economic zone of North Korea The exclusive economic zone of North Korea The exclusive economic zone of North Korea stretches 200 nautical miles from its basepoints in both the West Sea (Yellow Sea) and the Sea of Japan .

[ 76 ] The EEZ was declared in 1977 after North Korea had contested the validity of the Northern Limit Lines (NLL) set up after the Korean War as maritime borders.

[ 77 ] The EEZ has not been codified in law and North Korea has never specified its coordinates, making it difficult to determine its specific scope.

[ 78 ] In the West Sea, the EEZ remains unspecified in the Korea Bay because China has not determined its own EEZ in the area.

[ 79 ] The border between the North Korean and South Korean EEZs in the West Sea cannot be determined because of potential overlap and disputes over certain islands.

[ 80 ] In the Sea of Japan, the North Korean EEZ can be approximated to be trapezoidal -shaped.

[ 81 ] The border between North Korea and Russia's respective EEZs is the only such border that has been determined in East Asia.

[ 82 ] Here, the EEZ does not cause many problems, even with regards to South Korea, because the sea is not thought to be rich in resources.

[ 81 ] Norway [ edit ] Norway 's exclusive economic zones, including the dependency of Bouvet Island The Kingdom of Norway has a large exclusive economic zone of 819,620 km 2 around its coast. The country has a fishing zone of 1,878,953 km 2 , including fishing zones around Svalbard and Jan Mayen .

[ 83 ] In April 2009, the United Nations Commission for the Limits of the Continental Shelf approved Norway's claim to an additional 235,000 square kilometres of continental shelf. The commission found that Norway and Russia both had valid claims over a portion of the shelf in the Barents Sea.

Pakistan had an EEZ of 240,000 square kilometres (93,000 sq mi) before their case was accepted by UNCLCS.

Pakistan Navy with the help of the National Oceanographic Organization (NIO) initiated the continental shelf case at ministerial level in 1995.

On 26 Aug 2013, a seven-member sub-commission with members from Japan, China, Mozambique, Kenya, Denmark, Georgia and Argentina was formulated at UNCLCS to evaluate the technical details of Pakistan's case and after a year accepted Pakistan's claim.

On 13 March 2015, UN Commission on the Limits of Continental Shelf (UNCLCS) accepted recommendations for extension of the outer limits of the continental shelf on Pakistan's case so far 80 countries had submitted claims to UNCLCS out of which recommendations of 22 countries including Pakistan had been finalised.

It was a historic event in the country's history when Pakistan became the first country in the region to have its continental shelf extended to 350 nm.

Some of the claimed territories overlapped the Omani claim. It is believed that the verdict in favour of Pakistan was announced after successful negotiation with Oman.

But Portugal exercises sovereignty over the Savage Islands , a small archipelago north of the Canaries, claiming an EEZ border further south. Spain has no longer disputed the Portuguese claim since 2015.
