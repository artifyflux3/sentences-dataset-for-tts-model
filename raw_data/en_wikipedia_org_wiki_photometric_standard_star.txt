Other objects can be observed using CCD cameras or photoelectric photometers connected to a telescope , and the flux , or amount of light received, can be compared to a photometric-standard star to determine the exact brightness, or stellar magnitude , of the object.

[ 1 ] A current set of photometric-standard stars for UBVRI photometry was published by Arlo U. Landolt in 1992 in The Astronomical Journal .
