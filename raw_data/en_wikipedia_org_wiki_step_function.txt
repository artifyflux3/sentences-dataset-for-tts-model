For the unit step function, see Heaviside step function .

In mathematics, a function on the real numbers is called a step function if it can be written as a finite linear combination of indicator functions of intervals . Informally speaking, a step function is a piecewise constant function having only finitely many pieces.

An example of step functions (the red graph). In this function, each constant subfunction with a function value α i ( i = 0, 1, 2, ...) is defined by an interval A i and intervals are distinguished by points x j ( j = 1, 2, ...). This particular step function is right-continuous .

Definition and first consequences [ edit ] A function f : : R → → R {\displaystyle f\colon \mathbb {R} \rightarrow \mathbb {R} } is called a step function if it can be written as [ citation needed ] f ( x ) = ∑ ∑ i = 0 n α α i χ χ A i ( x ) {\displaystyle f(x)=\sum \limits _{i=0}^{n}\alpha _{i}\chi _{A_{i}}(x)} , for all real numbers x {\displaystyle x} where n ≥ ≥ 0 {\displaystyle n\geq 0} , α α i {\displaystyle \alpha _{i}} are real numbers, A i {\displaystyle A_{i}} are intervals, and χ χ A {\displaystyle \chi _{A}} is the indicator function of A {\displaystyle A} : χ χ A ( x ) = { 1 if x ∈ ∈ A 0 if x ∉ ∉ A {\displaystyle \chi _{A}(x)={\begin{cases}1&{\text{if }}x\in A\\0&{\text{if }}x\notin A\\\end{cases}}} In this definition, the intervals A i {\displaystyle A_{i}} can be assumed to have the following two properties: The intervals are pairwise disjoint : A i ∩ ∩ A j = ∅ ∅ {\displaystyle A_{i}\cap A_{j}=\emptyset } for i ≠ ≠ j {\displaystyle i\neq j} The union of the intervals is the entire real line: ⋃ ⋃ i = 0 n A i = R .

{\displaystyle \bigcup _{i=0}^{n}A_{i}=\mathbb {R} .} Indeed, if that is not the case to start with, a different set of intervals can be picked for which these assumptions hold. For example, the step function f = 4 χ χ [ − − 5 , 1 ) + 3 χ χ ( 0 , 6 ) {\displaystyle f=4\chi _{[-5,1)}+3\chi _{(0,6)}} can be written as f = 0 χ χ ( − − ∞ ∞ , − − 5 ) + 4 χ χ [ − − 5 , 0 ] + 7 χ χ ( 0 , 1 ) + 3 χ χ [ 1 , 6 ) + 0 χ χ [ 6 , ∞ ∞ ) .

{\displaystyle f=0\chi _{(-\infty ,-5)}+4\chi _{[-5,0]}+7\chi _{(0,1)}+3\chi _{[1,6)}+0\chi _{[6,\infty )}.} Variations in the definition [ edit ] Sometimes, the intervals are required to be right-open [ 1 ] or allowed to be singleton.

[ 2 ] The condition that the collection of intervals must be finite is often dropped, especially in school mathematics, [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] though it must still be locally finite , resulting in the definition of piecewise constant functions.

Examples [ edit ] The Heaviside step function is an often-used step function.

A constant function is a trivial example of a step function. Then there is only one interval, A 0 = R .

{\displaystyle A_{0}=\mathbb {R} .} The sign function sgn( x ) , which is −1 for negative numbers and +1 for positive numbers, and is the simplest non-constant step function.

The Heaviside function H ( x ) , which is 0 for negative numbers and 1 for positive numbers, is equivalent to the sign function, up to a shift and scale of range ( H = ( sgn + 1 ) / 2 {\displaystyle H=(\operatorname {sgn} +1)/2} ). It is the mathematical concept behind some test signals , such as those used to determine the step response of a dynamical system .

The rectangular function , the next simplest step function.

The rectangular function , the normalized boxcar function , is used to model a unit pulse.

Non-examples [ edit ] The integer part function is not a step function according to the definition of this article, since it has an infinite number of intervals. However, some authors [ 6 ] also define step functions with an infinite number of intervals.

[ 6 ] Properties [ edit ] The sum and product of two step functions is again a step function. The product of a step function with a number is also a step function. As such, the step functions form an algebra over the real numbers.

A step function takes only a finite number of values. If the intervals A i , {\displaystyle A_{i},} for i = 0 , 1 , … … , n {\displaystyle i=0,1,\dots ,n} in the above definition of the step function are disjoint and their union is the real line, then f ( x ) = α α i {\displaystyle f(x)=\alpha _{i}} for all x ∈ ∈ A i .

{\displaystyle x\in A_{i}.} The definite integral of a step function is a piecewise linear function .

The Lebesgue integral of a step function f = ∑ ∑ i = 0 n α α i χ χ A i {\displaystyle \textstyle f=\sum _{i=0}^{n}\alpha _{i}\chi _{A_{i}}} is ∫ ∫ f d x = ∑ ∑ i = 0 n α α i ℓ ℓ ( A i ) , {\displaystyle \textstyle \int f\,dx=\sum _{i=0}^{n}\alpha _{i}\ell (A_{i}),} where ℓ ℓ ( A ) {\displaystyle \ell (A)} is the length of the interval A {\displaystyle A} , and it is assumed here that all intervals A i {\displaystyle A_{i}} have finite length. In fact, this equality (viewed as a definition) can be the first step in constructing the Lebesgue integral.

[ 7 ] A discrete random variable is sometimes defined as a random variable whose cumulative distribution function is piecewise constant.

[ 8 ] In this case, it is locally a step function (globally, it may have an infinite number of steps). Usually however, any random variable with only countably many possible values is called a discrete random variable, in this case their cumulative distribution function is not necessarily locally a step function, as infinitely many intervals can accumulate in a finite region.
