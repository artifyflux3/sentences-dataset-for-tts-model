The hypothesis proposes that early life may have formed on the surface of iron sulfide minerals, hence the name.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] It was developed by retrodiction from extant biochemistry in conjunction with chemical experiments. The theory is consistent with the hypothesis that life originated near seafloor hydrothermal vents . He was encouraged and supported by science philosopher Karl R. Popper to publish his ideas.

Biographical background [ edit ] Wächtershäuser, a chemist by training, has been an international patent lawyer in Munich since 1970. He has published numerous articles in organic chemistry , genetic engineering and patent law , and has made contributions to evolutionary theory concerning the origins of perception and cognition, and the origin of life.

"Metabolism first" [ edit ] One of the key ideas advanced by Wächtershäuser is that an early form of metabolism predated genetics . Metabolism here means a cycle of chemical reactions that produce energy in a form that can be harnessed by other processes. The idea is that once a primitive metabolic cycle was established, it began to produce ever more complex compounds. His model is known as the iron-sulfur world theory by analogy with the RNA world hypothesis .

Awards [ edit ] In 1993, Wächtershäuser received the annual award of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and the following year he was made an honorary professor at the University of Regensburg .

[ 6 ] In 1999, Wächtershäuser received the Bonn Chemistry Award and in 2008 he was made an adjunct professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill .
