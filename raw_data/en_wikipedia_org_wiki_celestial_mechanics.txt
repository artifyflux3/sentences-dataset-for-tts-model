**Celestial mechanics** is the [branch of](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_astronomy "History of astronomy")[astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy "Astronomy") that deals with the [motions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics) "Motion (physics)") and [gravitational interactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_interaction "Gravitational interaction") of [objects in outer space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_object "Celestial object"). Historically, celestial mechanics applies principles of [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics") ([classical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics "Classical mechanics")) to astronomical objects, such as [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star "Star") and [planets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet "Planet"), to produce [ephemeris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephemeris "Ephemeris") data.

Modern analytic celestial mechanics started with [Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton")'s [_Principia_ (1687)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophi%C3%A6_Naturalis_Principia_Mathematica "Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica"). The name **celestial mechanics** is more recent than that. Newton wrote that the field should be called "rational mechanics".[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_mechanics#cite_note-1) The term "dynamics" came in a little later with [Gottfried Leibniz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Leibniz "Gottfried Leibniz"),[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_mechanics#cite_note-2) and over a century after Newton, [Pierre-Simon Laplace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Simon_Laplace "Pierre-Simon Laplace") introduced the term _celestial mechanics_.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_mechanics#cite_note-3) Prior to [Kepler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Kepler "Johannes Kepler"), there was little connection between exact, quantitative prediction of planetary positions, using [geometrical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_astronomy#Eudoxan_astronomy "Greek astronomy") or [numerical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_astronomy#Neo-Babylonian_astronomy "Babylonian astronomy") techniques, and contemporary discussions of the physical causes of the planets' motion.

### Laws of planetary motion

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Celestial_mechanics&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Laws of planetary motion")]

[Johannes Kepler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Kepler "Johannes Kepler") was the first to closely integrate the predictive geometrical astronomy, which had been dominant from [Ptolemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy "Ptolemy") in the 2nd century to [Copernicus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copernicus "Copernicus"), with physical concepts to produce a [_New Astronomy, Based upon Causes, or Celestial Physics_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomia_nova "Astronomia nova") in 1609. His work led to the [laws of planetary orbits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_laws_of_planetary_motion "Kepler's laws of planetary motion"), which he developed using his physical principles and the [planetary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet "Planet") observations made by [Tycho Brahe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tycho_Brahe "Tycho Brahe"). Kepler's elliptical model greatly improved the accuracy of predictions of planetary motion, years before Newton developed his [law of gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation "Newton's law of universal gravitation") in 1686.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_mechanics#cite_note-4)

### Newtonian mechanics and universal gravitation

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Celestial_mechanics&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Newtonian mechanics and universal gravitation")]

[Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton") is credited with introducing the idea that the motion of objects in the heavens, such as [planets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet "Planet"), the [Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun "Sun"), and the [Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon "Moon"), and the motion of objects on the ground, like [cannon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannon "Cannon") balls and falling apples, could be described by the same set of [physical laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_law "Physical law"). In this sense he unified _celestial_ and _terrestrial_ dynamics. Using [his law of gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation "Newton's law of universal gravitation"), Newton confirmed [Kepler's laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_laws_of_planetary_motion "Kepler's laws of planetary motion") for elliptical orbits by deriving them from the gravitational [two-body problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-body_problem "Two-body problem"), which Newton included in his epochal _[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophi%C3%A6\_Naturalis\_Principia\_Mathematica "Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica")_ in 1687.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_mechanics#cite_note-5)

[![Image 1](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Lagrange_2_mass.gif/250px-Lagrange_2_mass.gif)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Lagrange_2_mass.gif)

The five Lagrange points for a circular orbit

Following Newton, mathematicians attempted to solve the more complex problem of predicting the future motion of three bodies interacting through gravity: the [three-body problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-body_problem "Three-body problem"). The first to provide a periodic solution was the Swiss mathematician [Leonhard Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler "Leonhard Euler"), who in 1762 demonstrated three equilibrium points lie along a straight line passing through the two primary masses. If a body of infinitesimal mass occupied one of these points, it would remain there in a stable orbit. French mathematician [Joseph-Louis Lagrange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph-Louis_Lagrange "Joseph-Louis Lagrange") attempted to solve this restricted three-body problem in 1772, and discovered two more stable orbits at the vertices of [equilateral triangles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equilateral_triangle "Equilateral triangle") with the two primary masses. Collectively, these solutions became known as the [Lagrange points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point "Lagrange point").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_mechanics#cite_note-6)

Lagrange reformulated the principles of [classical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics "Classical mechanics"), emphasizing energy more than force,[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_mechanics#cite_note-7) and developing a [method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_mechanics "Lagrangian mechanics") to use a single polar coordinate equation to describe any orbit, even those that are parabolic and hyperbolic. This is useful for calculating the behaviour of planets and [comets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet "Comet") and such (parabolic and hyperbolic orbits are [conic section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conic_section "Conic section") extensions of Kepler's [elliptical orbits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptical_orbit "Elliptical orbit")).[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_mechanics#cite_note-8)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_mechanics#cite_note-9) More recently, it has also become useful to calculate [spacecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft "Spacecraft")[trajectories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajectory "Trajectory").[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_mechanics#cite_note-10)

[Henri Poincaré](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Poincar%C3%A9 "Henri Poincaré") published two now classical monographs, "New Methods of Celestial Mechanics" (1892–1899) and "Lectures on Celestial Mechanics" (1905–1910). In them, he successfully applied the results of their research to the problem of the motion of three bodies and studied in detail the behavior of solutions (frequency, stability, asymptotic, and so on). Poincaré showed that the three-body problem is not integrable. In other words, the general solution of the three-body problem can not be expressed in terms of [algebraic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra "Algebra") and [transcendental functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendental_functions "Transcendental functions") through unambiguous coordinates and velocities of the bodies. His work in this area was the first major achievement in celestial mechanics since Isaac Newton's _Principia_.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_mechanics#cite_note-11)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_mechanics#cite_note-James_2002-12)

These monographs include an idea of Poincaré, which later became the basis for mathematical "[chaos theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory "Chaos theory")" (see, in particular, the [Poincaré recurrence theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_recurrence_theorem "Poincaré recurrence theorem")) and the general theory of [dynamical systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system "Dynamical system"). He introduced the important concept of [bifurcation points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bifurcation_theory "Bifurcation theory") and proved the existence of equilibrium figures such as the non-ellipsoids, including ring-shaped and pear-shaped figures, and their stability. For this discovery, Poincaré received the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society (1900).[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_mechanics#cite_note-Gold_Medal_to_Poincar%C3%A9-13)

### Standardisation of astronomical tables

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Celestial_mechanics&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Standardisation of astronomical tables")]

[Simon Newcomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Newcomb "Simon Newcomb") was a Canadian-American astronomer who revised [Peter Andreas Hansen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Andreas_Hansen "Peter Andreas Hansen")'s table of lunar positions.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_mechanics#cite_note-14) In 1877, assisted by [George William Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_William_Hill "George William Hill"), he recalculated all the major astronomical constants. After 1884 he conceived, with [A. M. W. Downing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Matthew_Weld_Downing "Arthur Matthew Weld Downing"), a plan to resolve much international confusion on the subject. By the time he attended a standardisation conference in [Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris "Paris"), France, in May 1886, the international consensus was that all ephemerides should be based on Newcomb's calculations. A further conference as late as 1950 confirmed Newcomb's constants as the international standard.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_mechanics#cite_note-15)

### Anomalous precession of Mercury

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Celestial_mechanics&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Anomalous precession of Mercury")]

[![Image 2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Perihelion_precession.svg/250px-Perihelion_precession.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Perihelion_precession.svg)

Apsidal precession of Mercury's orbit around the Sun (not to scale)

In 1849, [Urbain Le Verrier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urbain_Le_Verrier "Urbain Le Verrier") reported that Mercury's closest approach the Sun, its [perihelion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perihelion "Perihelion"), was observed to advance at the rate of 43[″](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_of_arc "Second of arc") per century. This [precession of Mercury's perihelion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tests_of_general_relativity#Perihelion_precession_of_Mercury "Tests of general relativity") could not be accounted for by known gravitational perturbations using Newton's law. Instead, Le Verrier later attributed the effect to a proposed planet orbiting inside the orbit of Mercury. Dubbed [Vulcan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulcan_(hypothetical_planet) "Vulcan (hypothetical planet)"), subsequent searches failed to locate any such body. The cause remained a mystery until [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein") explained the [apsidal precession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsidal_precession "Apsidal precession") in his 1916 paper _The Foundation of the General Theory of Relativity_. [General relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity") led astronomers to recognize that [Newtonian mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newtonian_mechanics "Newtonian mechanics") did not provide the highest accuracy in proximity to massive bodies.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_mechanics#cite_note-16) This led to attempts to solve the [two-body problem in general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-body_problem_in_general_relativity "Two-body problem in general relativity") and the discovery of [gravitational radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_radiation "Gravitational radiation").[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_mechanics#cite_note-17)[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_mechanics#cite_note-18)

Examples of problems
--------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Celestial_mechanics&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Examples of problems")]

Celestial motion, without additional forces such as [drag forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_force "Drag force") or the [thrust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrust "Thrust") of a [rocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket "Rocket"), is governed by the reciprocal gravitational acceleration between masses. A generalization is the [_n_-body problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-body_problem "N-body problem"),[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_mechanics#cite_note-19) where a number _n_ of masses are mutually interacting via the gravitational force. Although analytically not [integrable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrable "Integrable") in the general case,[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_mechanics#cite_note-20) the integration can be well approximated numerically.

Examples: 
*   4-body problem: spaceflight to Mars (for parts of the flight the influence of one or two bodies is very small, so that there we have a 2- or 3-body problem; see also the [patched conic approximation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patched_conic_approximation "Patched conic approximation"))
*   3-body problem: 
    *   [Quasi-satellite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasi-satellite "Quasi-satellite")
    *   Spaceflight to, and stay at a [Lagrangian point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_point "Lagrangian point")

In the ![Image 3: {\displaystyle n=2}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a02c8bd752d2cc859747ca1f3a508281bdbc3b34) case ([two-body problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-body_problem "Two-body problem")) the configuration is much simpler than for ![Image 4: {\displaystyle n>2}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/44e71ac55b9fbf1e9f341b946cda63d61d3ef2cd). In this case, the system is fully integrable and exact solutions can be found.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_mechanics#cite_note-21)

Examples: 
*   A [binary star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_star "Binary star"), e.g., [Alpha Centauri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_Centauri "Alpha Centauri") (approx. the same mass)
*   A [binary asteroid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_asteroid "Binary asteroid"), e.g., [90 Antiope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/90_Antiope "90 Antiope") (approx. the same mass)

A further simplification is based on the "standard assumptions in astrodynamics", which include that one body, the [orbiting body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbiting_body "Orbiting body"), is much smaller than the other, the [central body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_body "Central body"). This is also often approximately valid.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_mechanics#cite_note-22)

Examples: 
*   The [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System "Solar System") orbiting the center of the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way "Milky Way")
*   A planet orbiting the Sun
*   A moon orbiting a planet
*   A spacecraft orbiting Earth, a moon, or a planet (in the latter cases the approximation only applies after arrival at that orbit)

Perturbation theory
-------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Celestial_mechanics&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Perturbation theory")]

[Perturbation theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perturbation_theory "Perturbation theory") comprises mathematical methods that are used to find an approximate solution to a problem which cannot be solved exactly. (It is closely related to methods used in [numerical analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_analysis "Numerical analysis"), which [are ancient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_computing_square_roots#Heron's_method "Methods of computing square roots").) The earliest use of modern [perturbation theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perturbation_theory "Perturbation theory") was to deal with the otherwise unsolvable mathematical problems of celestial mechanics: [Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton")'s solution for the orbit of the [Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon "Moon"), which moves noticeably differently from a simple [Keplerian ellipse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_laws_of_planetary_motion "Kepler's laws of planetary motion") because of the competing gravitation of the [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth") and the [Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun "Sun").[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_mechanics#cite_note-23) Additional sources of orbital perturbation include [atmospheric drag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_drag "Atmospheric drag"), [solar radiation pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_radiation_pressure "Solar radiation pressure"), and non-uniform gravitational fields.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_mechanics#cite_note-24)

[Perturbation methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perturbation_theory "Perturbation theory") start with a simplified form of the original problem, which is chosen to be exactly solvable. In celestial mechanics, this is usually a [Keplerian ellipse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_laws_of_planetary_motion "Kepler's laws of planetary motion"), which is correct when there are only two gravitating bodies, but is often close enough for practical use. The solved, but simplified problem is then _"perturbed"_ to make its [time-rate-of-change equations for the object's position](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation "Differential equation") closer to the values from the real problem. The changes that result from the terms in the equations are used as corrections to the original solution.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_mechanics#cite_note-25) Because simplifications are made at every step, the corrections are never perfect, but even one cycle of corrections often provides a better approximation.

A partially corrected solution can be re-used as the new starting point for another cycle of perturbations and corrections. In principle, the recycling of prior solutions to obtain a better solution could continue indefinitely. The difficulty is that the corrections usually progressively make the new solutions more complicated. [Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton") is reported to have said, regarding the problem of the [Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon "Moon")'s orbit _"It causeth my head to ache."_.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_mechanics#cite_note-26)

[![Image 5](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Inertial_frames.svg/250px-Inertial_frames.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Inertial_frames.svg)

An [inertial frame of reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_frame_of_reference "Inertial frame of reference") (brown) mapped from a baseline coordinate system (blue)

A reference frame is an arbitrary defined [coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_system "Coordinate system"), whose origin, orientation, and scale are specified in [physical space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_space "Physical space"). The frame is aligned via a set of reference points, such as distant galaxies.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_mechanics#cite_note-27) Problems in celestial mechanics are often posed in simplifying reference frames, such as the **synodic reference frame** applied to the [three-body problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-body_problem "Three-body problem"), where the origin coincides with the [barycenter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barycenter "Barycenter") of the two larger celestial bodies. Other reference frames for n-body simulations include those that place the origin to follow the center of mass of a body, such as the heliocentric and the geocentric reference frames.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_mechanics#cite_note-28) The choice of reference frame gives rise to phenomena such as the [retrograde motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrograde_and_prograde_motion "Retrograde and prograde motion") of [superior planets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferior_and_superior_planets "Inferior and superior planets") in a geocentric reference frame.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_mechanics#cite_note-29)

An [Inertial frame of reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_frame_of_reference "Inertial frame of reference") is employed for bodies with mass. Thus a Lunar Reference System defines an Earth Inertial frame with Earth as the origin, the Lunar Inertial frame having an origin of the Moon, and an Earth-Moon Barycentric Rotating frame anchored to the rotating [Earth-Moon barycenter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth-Moon_barycenter "Earth-Moon barycenter").[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_mechanics#cite_note-30)[Positioning systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positioning_system "Positioning system") such as [GPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS "GPS") or [GLONASS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLONASS "GLONASS") use a reference frame based on the Earth. However, these are unsuitable for navigation in space.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_mechanics#cite_note-31) For interplanetary trajectories, a heliocentric (Sun-centered) coordinate system is used, with the XY plane aligned with the [ecliptic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecliptic "Ecliptic") as defined for a particular [epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch "Epoch").[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_mechanics#cite_note-32)

The [local standard of rest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_standard_of_rest "Local standard of rest") (LSR) is a reference frame based on the mean motion of stellar objects in the neighborhood of the Sun. The [peculiar velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peculiar_velocity "Peculiar velocity") of the Sun relative to this framework is 13.4 km/s in the direction of the [solar apex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_apex "Solar apex").[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_mechanics#cite_note-33) There are two possible definitions for the LSR: the first is based on the kinetic motion of nearby stars, and the second is a dynamical standard that follows the Sun in its orbit around the galaxy. These two drift apart with the passage of time as the stars follow the gravitational potential around the galaxy. Perturbations in a star's galactic orbit result in [epicycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicycle "Epicycle") motions.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_mechanics#cite_note-34)

The [cosmic microwave background](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background "Cosmic microwave background") has its own co-moving frame of reference. The relative motion of the Sun at 365 km/s results in a [dipole anisotropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipole_anisotropy "Dipole anisotropy") due to [redshift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift "Redshift") of the isotropic radiation from this source.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_mechanics#cite_note-35)

[![Image 6](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Orbital_motion.gif/261px-Orbital_motion.gif)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Orbital_motion.gif)

A satellite orbiting Earth has a [tangential velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed#Tangential_speed "Speed") and an inward [acceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration "Acceleration").

[Orbital mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_mechanics "Orbital mechanics") or astrodynamics is the application of [ballistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistics "Ballistics") and celestial mechanics to [rockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket "Rocket"), [satellites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite "Satellite"), and other [spacecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft "Spacecraft"). The motion of these objects is usually calculated from [Newton's laws of motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion "Newton's laws of motion") and the [law of universal gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation "Newton's law of universal gravitation"). Astrodynamics is a core discipline within [space-mission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_exploration "Space exploration") design and control.

Celestial mechanics treats more broadly the orbital dynamics of systems under the influence of [gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity "Gravity"), including both spacecraft and natural [astronomical bodies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_object "Astronomical object") such as [star systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_system "Star system"), [planets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet "Planet"), [moons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_satellite "Natural satellite"), and [comets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet "Comet"). Orbital mechanics focuses on spacecraft [trajectories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajectory "Trajectory"), including [orbital maneuvers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_maneuver "Orbital maneuver"), [orbital plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_plane_(astronomy) "Orbital plane (astronomy)") changes, and interplanetary transfers, and is used by mission planners to predict the results of [propulsive maneuvers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft_propulsion "Spacecraft propulsion").

[General relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity") is a more exact theory than Newton's laws for calculating orbits, and it is sometimes necessary to use it for greater accuracy or in high-gravity situations (e.g. orbits near the Sun).

*   [Astrometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrometry "Astrometry") is a part of astronomy that deals with measuring the positions of stars and other celestial bodies, their distances and movements.

*   Creating a [numerical model of the solar system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_model_of_solar_system "Numerical model of solar system") was the original goal of celestial mechanics, and has only been imperfectly achieved. It continues to motivate research.

*   [Osculating orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osculating_orbit "Osculating orbit") is the temporary Keplerian orbit about a central body that an object would continue on, if other perturbations were not present.
*   [Retrograde motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrograde_motion "Retrograde motion") is orbital motion in a system, such as a planet and its satellites, that is contrary to the direction of rotation of the central body, or more generally contrary in direction to the net angular momentum of the entire system.
*   [Apparent retrograde motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_retrograde_motion "Apparent retrograde motion") is the periodic, apparently backwards motion of planetary bodies when viewed from the Earth (an accelerated reference frame).
*   [Tidal force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_force "Tidal force") is the combination of out-of-balance forces and accelerations of (mostly) solid bodies that raises tides in bodies of liquid (oceans), atmospheres, and strains planets' and satellites' crusts.
*   Two solutions, called [VSOP82 and VSOP87](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VSOP_(planets) "VSOP (planets)") are versions one mathematical theory for the orbits and positions of the major planets, which seeks to provide accurate positions over an extended period of time.
