In mathematics and other fields, [ a ] a lemma ( pl.

: lemmas or lemmata ) is a generally minor, proven proposition which is used to prove a larger statement. For that reason, it is also known as a "helping theorem " or an "auxiliary theorem".

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] In many cases, a lemma derives its importance from the theorem it aims to prove ; however, a lemma can also turn out to be more important than originally thought.

[ 5 ] Etymology [ edit ] From the Ancient Greek λῆμμα, (perfect passive εἴλημμαι) something received or taken. Thus something taken for granted in an argument.

[ 6 ] Comparison with theorem [ edit ] There is no formal distinction between a lemma and a theorem , only one of intention (see Theorem terminology ). However, a lemma can be considered a minor result whose sole purpose is to help prove a more substantial theorem – a step in the direction of proof.

[ 5 ] Well-known lemmas [ edit ] Some powerful results in mathematics are known as lemmas, first named for their originally minor purpose. These include, among others: Bézout's lemma Burnside's lemma Dehn's lemma Euclid's lemma Farkas' lemma Fatou's lemma Gauss's lemma (any of several named after Carl Friedrich Gauss ) Greendlinger's lemma Itô's lemma Jordan's lemma Lovász local lemma Nakayama's lemma Poincaré's lemma Riesz's lemma Schur's lemma Schwarz's lemma Sperner's lemma Urysohn's lemma Vitali covering lemma Yoneda's lemma Zorn's lemma While these results originally seemed too simple or too technical to warrant independent interest, they have eventually turned out to be central to the theories in which they occur.
