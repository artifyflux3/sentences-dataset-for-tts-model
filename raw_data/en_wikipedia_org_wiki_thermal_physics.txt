Thermal physics is the combined study of thermodynamics , statistical mechanics , and kinetic theory of gases .  This umbrella-subject is typically designed for physics students and functions to provide a general introduction to each of three core heat-related subjects.  Other authors, however, define thermal physics loosely as a summation of only thermodynamics and statistical mechanics.

[ 1 ] Thermal physics can be seen as the study of systems with a large number  of atoms.  It unites thermodynamics and statistical mechanics.

Overview [ edit ] Thermal physics, generally speaking, is the study of the statistical nature of physical systems from an energetic perspective.  Starting with the basics of heat and temperature , thermal physics analyzes the first law of thermodynamics and second law of thermodynamics from the statistical perspective, in terms of the number of microstates corresponding to a given macrostate .  In addition, the concept of entropy is studied via quantum theory .

A central topic in thermal physics is the canonical probability distribution .  The electromagnetic nature of photons and phonons are studied which show that the oscillations of electromagnetic fields and of crystal lattices have much in common.  Waves form a basis for both, provided one incorporates quantum theory.

Other topics studied in thermal physics include: chemical potential , the quantum nature of an ideal gas , i.e. in terms of fermions and bosons , Bose–Einstein condensation , Gibbs free energy , Helmholtz free energy , chemical equilibrium , phase equilibrium , the equipartition theorem , entropy at absolute zero , and transport processes as mean free path , viscosity , and conduction .
