In the mathematical study of order , a metric lattice L is a lattice that admits a positive valuation : a function v ∈ L → ℝ satisfying, for any a , b ∈ L , [ 1 ] v ( a ) + v ( b ) = v ( a ∧ ∧ b ) + v ( a ∨ ∨ b ) {\displaystyle v(a)+v(b)=v(a\wedge b)+v(a\vee b)} and a > b ⇒ ⇒ v ( a ) > v ( b ) .

{\displaystyle {a>b}\Rightarrow v(a)>v(b){\text{.}}} Relation to other notions [ edit ] A lattice containing N5 (depicted) cannot be a metric one, since v ( d )+ v ( c ) = v ( e )+ v ( a ) = v ( b )+ v ( c ) implies v ( d ) = v ( b ), contradicting v ( d ) < v ( b ).

A Boolean algebra is a metric lattice; any finitely-additive measure on its Stone dual gives a valuation.

[ 2 ] : 252–254 Every metric lattice is a modular lattice , [ 1 ] c.f. lower picture. It is also a metric space , with distance function given by [ 3 ] d ( x , y ) = v ( x ∨ ∨ y ) − − v ( x ∧ ∧ y ) .

{\displaystyle d(x,y)=v(x\vee y)-v(x\wedge y){\text{.}}} With that metric, the join and meet are uniformly continuous contractions , [ 2 ] : 77 and so extend to the metric completion (metric space) .  That lattice is usually not the Dedekind-MacNeille completion , but it is conditionally complete .

[ 2 ] : 80 Applications [ edit ] In the study of fuzzy logic and interval arithmetic , the space of uniform distributions is a metric lattice.

[ 3 ] Metric lattices are also key to von Neumann's construction of the continuous projective geometry .

[ 2 ] : 126 A function satisfies the one-dimensional wave equation if and only if it is a valuation for the lattice of spacetime coordinates with the natural partial order.  A similar result should apply to any partial differential equation solvable by the method of characteristics , but key features of the theory are lacking.
