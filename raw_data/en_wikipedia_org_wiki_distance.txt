**Distance** is a numerical or occasionally qualitative [measurement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement "Measurement") of how far apart objects, points, people, or ideas are. In [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics") or everyday usage, distance may refer to a physical [length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length "Length") or an estimation based on other criteria (e.g. "two counties over"). The term is also frequently used metaphorically[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance#cite_note-1) to mean a measurement of the amount of difference between two similar objects (such as [statistical distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_distance "Statistical distance") between [probability distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution "Probability distribution") or [edit distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edit_distance "Edit distance") between [strings of text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science) "String (computer science)")) or a degree of separation (as exemplified by [distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance_(graph_theory) "Distance (graph theory)") between people in a [social network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network "Social network")). Most such notions of distance, both physical and metaphorical, are formalized in [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics") using the notion of a [metric space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_space "Metric space").

In the [social sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_science "Social science"), **distance** can refer to a qualitative measurement of separation, such as [social distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_distance "Social distance") or [psychological distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_distance "Psychological distance").

Distances in physics and geometry
---------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Distance&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Distances in physics and geometry")]

The distance between physical locations can be defined in different ways in different contexts.

### Straight-line or Euclidean distance

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Distance&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Straight-line or Euclidean distance")]

The distance between two points in physical [space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space "Space") is the [length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length "Length") of a [straight line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_segment "Line segment") between them, which is the shortest possible path. This is the usual meaning of distance in [classical physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_physics "Classical physics"), including [Newtonian mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newtonian_mechanics "Newtonian mechanics").

Straight-line distance is formalized mathematically as the [Euclidean distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance "Euclidean distance") in [two-](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-dimensional_Euclidean_space "Two-dimensional Euclidean space") and [three-dimensional space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_space "Three-dimensional space"). In [Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry "Euclidean geometry"), the distance between two points A and B is often denoted ![Image 2: {\displaystyle |AB|}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fa0bf6dba77a8b8734eb4356cac20b49e9a80c3c). In [coordinate geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system "Cartesian coordinate system"), Euclidean distance is computed using the [Pythagorean theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem "Pythagorean theorem"). The distance between points (_x_ 1, _y_ 1) and (_x_ 2, _y_ 2) in the plane is given by:[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance#cite_note-:0-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance#cite_note-3)![Image 3: {\displaystyle d={\sqrt {(\Delta x)^{2}+(\Delta y)^{2}}}={\sqrt {(x_{2}-x_{1})^{2}+(y_{2}-y_{1})^{2}}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/617b88d273f6cec8288acc4a071c855ce441e49b) Similarly, given points (_x_ 1, _y_ 1, _z_ 1) and (_x_ 2, _y_ 2, _z_ 2) in three-dimensional space, the distance between them is:[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance#cite_note-:0-2)![Image 4: {\displaystyle d={\sqrt {(\Delta x)^{2}+(\Delta y)^{2}+(\Delta z)^{2}}}={\sqrt {(x_{2}-x_{1})^{2}+(y_{2}-y_{1})^{2}+(z_{2}-z_{1})^{2}}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e8518a4bd2334b23780a251a54df9c43fd67a26c) This idea generalizes to higher-dimensional [Euclidean spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space").

There are many ways of [measuring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measuring "Measuring") straight-line distances. For example, it can be done directly using a [ruler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruler "Ruler"), or indirectly with a [radar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar "Radar") (for long distances) or [interferometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferometry "Interferometry") (for very short distances). The [cosmic distance ladder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_distance_ladder "Cosmic distance ladder") is a set of ways of measuring extremely long distances.

### Shortest-path distance on a curved surface

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Distance&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Shortest-path distance on a curved surface")]

[![Image 5](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/Greatcircle_Jetstream_routes.svg/500px-Greatcircle_Jetstream_routes.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Greatcircle_Jetstream_routes.svg)

Airline routes between [Los Angeles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles "Los Angeles") and [Tokyo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo "Tokyo") approximately follow a [great circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_circle "Great circle") going west (top) but use the [jet stream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_stream "Jet stream") (bottom) when heading eastwards. The shortest route appears as a curve rather than a straight line because the [map projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_projection "Map projection") does not scale all distances equally compared to the real spherical surface of the Earth.

The straight-line distance between two points on the surface of the Earth is not very useful for most purposes, since we cannot tunnel straight through the [Earth's mantle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_mantle "Earth's mantle"). Instead, one typically measures the shortest path along the [surface of the Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_of_the_Earth "Surface of the Earth"), [as the crow flies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_the_crow_flies "As the crow flies"). This is approximated mathematically by the [great-circle distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great-circle_distance "Great-circle distance") on a sphere.

More generally, the shortest path between two points along a [curved surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(mathematics) "Surface (mathematics)") is known as a [geodesic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic "Geodesic"). The [arc length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc_length "Arc length") of geodesics gives a way of measuring distance from the perspective of an [ant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant "Ant") or other flightless creature living on that surface.

### Effects of relativity

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Distance&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Effects of relativity")]

In the [theory of relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_relativity "Theory of relativity"), because of phenomena such as [length contraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_contraction "Length contraction") and the [relativity of simultaneity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_of_simultaneity "Relativity of simultaneity"), distances between objects depend on a choice of [inertial frame of reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_frame_of_reference "Inertial frame of reference"). On galactic and larger scales, the measurement of distance is also affected by the [expansion of the universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansion_of_the_universe "Expansion of the universe"). In practice, a number of [distance measures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance_measure "Distance measure") are used in [cosmology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology "Cosmology") to quantify such distances.

### Other spatial distances

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Distance&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Other spatial distances")]

[![Image 6](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Manhattan_distance.svg/250px-Manhattan_distance.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Manhattan_distance.svg)

[Manhattan distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_distance "Manhattan distance") on a grid

Unusual definitions of distance can be helpful to model certain physical situations, but are also used in theoretical mathematics:

*   In practice, one is often interested in the travel distance between two points along roads, rather than as the crow flies. In a [grid plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grid_plan "Grid plan"), the travel distance between street corners is given by the [Manhattan distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_distance "Manhattan distance"): the number of east–west and north–south blocks one must traverse to get between those two points.
*   Chessboard distance, formalized as [Chebyshev distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev_distance "Chebyshev distance"), is the minimum number of moves a [king](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_(chess) "King (chess)") must make on a [chessboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chessboard "Chessboard") in order to travel between two squares.

Many abstract notions of distance used in mathematics, science and engineering represent a degree of difference or separation between similar objects. This page gives a few examples.

### Statistical distances

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Distance&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Statistical distances")]

In [statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics "Statistics") and [information geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_geometry "Information geometry"), [statistical distances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_distance "Statistical distance") measure the degree of difference between two [probability distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution "Probability distribution"). There are many kinds of statistical distances, typically formalized as [divergences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergence_(statistics) "Divergence (statistics)"); these allow a set of probability distributions to be understood as a [geometrical object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(mathematics) "Space (mathematics)") called a [statistical manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_manifold "Statistical manifold"). The most elementary is the [squared Euclidean distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squared_Euclidean_distance "Squared Euclidean distance"), which is minimized by the [least squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_squares "Least squares") method; this is the most basic [Bregman divergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bregman_divergence "Bregman divergence"). The most important in [information theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory "Information theory") is the [relative entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_entropy "Relative entropy") ([Kullback–Leibler divergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence "Kullback–Leibler divergence")), which allows one to analogously study [maximum likelihood estimation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_likelihood_estimation "Maximum likelihood estimation") geometrically; this is an example of both an [_f_-divergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-divergence "F-divergence") and a Bregman divergence (and in fact the only example which is both). Statistical manifolds corresponding to Bregman divergences are [flat manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_manifold "Flat manifold") in the corresponding geometry, allowing an analog of the [Pythagorean theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem "Pythagorean theorem") (which holds for squared Euclidean distance) to be used for [linear inverse problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_inverse_problem "Linear inverse problem") in inference by [optimization theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimization_theory "Optimization theory").

Other important statistical distances include the [Mahalanobis distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahalanobis_distance "Mahalanobis distance") and the [energy distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_distance "Energy distance").

In [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science"), an [edit distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edit_distance "Edit distance") or [string metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_metric "String metric") between two [strings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science) "String (computer science)") measures how different they are. For example, the words "dog" and "dot", which differ by just one letter, are closer than "dog" and "cat", which have no letters in common. This idea is used in [spell checkers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spell_checker "Spell checker") and in [coding theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding_theory "Coding theory"), and is mathematically formalized in a number of different ways, including [Levenshtein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance "Levenshtein distance"), [Hamming distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance "Hamming distance"), [Lee distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_distance "Lee distance"), and [Jaro–Winkler distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaro%E2%80%93Winkler_distance "Jaro–Winkler distance").

### Distance in graph theory

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Distance&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Distance in graph theory")]

In a [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics) "Graph (discrete mathematics)"), the [distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance_(graph_theory) "Distance (graph theory)") between two vertices is measured by the length of the shortest [edge path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(graph_theory) "Path (graph theory)") between them. For example, if the graph represents a [social network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network "Social network"), then the idea of [six degrees of separation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_degrees_of_separation "Six degrees of separation") can be interpreted mathematically as saying that the distance between any two vertices is at most six. Similarly, the [Erdős number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s_number "Erdős number") and the [Bacon number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacon_number "Bacon number")—the number of collaborative relationships away a person is from prolific mathematician [Paul Erdős](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Erd%C5%91s "Paul Erdős") and actor [Kevin Bacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Bacon "Kevin Bacon"), respectively—are distances in the graphs whose edges represent mathematical or artistic collaborations.

In [psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology "Psychology"), [human geography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_geography "Human geography"), and the [social sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_science "Social science"), distance is often theorized not as an objective numerical measurement, but as a qualitative description of a subjective experience.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance#cite_note-4) For example, [psychological distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_distance "Psychological distance") is "the different ways in which an object might be removed from" the self along dimensions such as "time, space, social distance, and hypotheticality".[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance#cite_note-psych-5) In [sociology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociology "Sociology"), [social distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_distance "Social distance") describes the separation between individuals or [social groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_groups "Social groups") in [society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society "Society") along dimensions such as [social class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class "Social class"), [race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(classification_of_human_beings) "Race (classification of human beings)")/[ethnicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnicity "Ethnicity"), [gender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender "Gender") or [sexuality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality "Human sexuality").

Mathematical formalization
--------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Distance&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Mathematical formalization")]

Most of the notions of distance between two points or objects described above are examples of the mathematical idea of a [metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_space "Metric space"). A _metric_ or _distance function_ is a [function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics) "Function (mathematics)")d which takes pairs of points or objects to [real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_numbers "Real numbers") and satisfies the following rules:

1.   The distance between an object and itself is always zero.
2.   The distance between distinct objects is always positive.
3.   Distance is [symmetric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_relation "Symmetric relation"): the distance from x to y is always the same as the distance from y to x.
4.   Distance satisfies the [triangle inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_inequality "Triangle inequality"): if x, y, and z are three objects, then ![Image 7: {\displaystyle d(x,z)\leq d(x,y)+d(y,z).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1e7072502a79725a25151d5c96b7310e7dbb97a3) This condition can be described informally as "intermediate stops can't speed you up."

As an exception, many of the [divergences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergence_(statistics) "Divergence (statistics)") used in statistics are not metrics.

[![Image 8](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Distance_function_animation.gif/250px-Distance_function_animation.gif)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Distance_function_animation.gif)

Distance between sets
---------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Distance&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Distance between sets")]

[![Image 9](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/Distance_between_sets.svg/250px-Distance_between_sets.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Distance_between_sets.svg)

The distances between these three sets do not satisfy the triangle inequality:![Image 10: {\displaystyle d(A,B)>d(A,C)+d(C,B)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2c30d1db0082ceb2240ec12e1c1bd88d37154dce)

There are multiple ways of measuring the physical distance between objects that [consist of more than one point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(metaphysics) "Extension (metaphysics)"):

*   One may measure the distance between representative points such as the [center of mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_mass "Center of mass"); this is used for astronomical distances such as the [Earth–Moon distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_distance_(astronomy) "Lunar distance (astronomy)").
*   One may measure the distance between the closest points of the two objects; in this sense, the [altitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altitude "Altitude") of an airplane or spacecraft is its distance from the Earth. The same sense of distance is used in Euclidean geometry to define [distance from a point to a line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance_from_a_point_to_a_line "Distance from a point to a line"), [distance from a point to a plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance_from_a_point_to_a_plane "Distance from a point to a plane"), or, more generally, [perpendicular distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpendicular_distance "Perpendicular distance") between [affine subspaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_subspace "Affine subspace").

Even more generally, this idea can be used to define the distance between two [subsets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset "Subset") of a metric space. The distance between sets A and B is the [infimum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infimum "Infimum") of the distances between any two of their respective points:![Image 11: {\displaystyle d(A,B)=\inf _{x\in A,y\in B}d(x,y).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9209edb97082243dbaf8e4041de388b3aebe097e) This does not define a metric on the set of such subsets: the distance between overlapping sets is zero, and this distance does not satisfy the triangle inequality for any metric space with two or more points (consider the triple of sets consisting of two distinct singletons and their union).
*   The [Hausdorff distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_distance "Hausdorff distance") between two subsets of a metric space can be thought of as measuring how far they are from perfectly overlapping. Somewhat more precisely, the Hausdorff distance between A and B is either the distance from A to the farthest point of B, or the distance from B to the farthest point of A, whichever is larger. (Here "farthest point" must be interpreted as a supremum.) The Hausdorff distance defines a metric on the set of [compact subsets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space "Compact space") of a metric space.

Further information: [Length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length "Length")

The word **distance** is also used for related concepts that are not encompassed by the description "a numerical measurement of how far apart points or objects are".

The **distance travelled** by an object is the length of a specific path travelled between two points,[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance#cite_note-6) such as the distance walked while navigating a [maze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze "Maze"). This can even be a **closed distance** along a [closed curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_curve "Closed curve") which starts and ends at the same point, such as a ball thrown straight up, or the Earth when it completes one [orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit "Orbit"). This is formalized mathematically as the [arc length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc_length "Arc length") of the curve.

The distance travelled may also be [signed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_(mathematics) "Sign (mathematics)"): a "forward" distance is positive and a "backward" distance is negative.

**Circular distance** is the distance traveled by a point on the circumference of a [wheel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel "Wheel"), which can be useful to consider when designing vehicles or mechanical gears (see also [odometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odometry "Odometry")). The circumference of the wheel is 2π × radius; if the radius is 1, each revolution of the wheel causes a vehicle to travel 2π radians.

### Displacement and directed distance

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Distance&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Displacement and directed distance")]

[![Image 12](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/Distancedisplacement.svg/250px-Distancedisplacement.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Distancedisplacement.svg)

Distance along a path compared with displacement. The Euclidean distance is the length of the displacement vector.

The [displacement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_(vector) "Displacement (vector)") in classical physics measures the change in position of an object during an interval of time. While distance is a [scalar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_(physics) "Scalar (physics)") quantity, or a [magnitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnitude_(mathematics) "Magnitude (mathematics)"), displacement is a [vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(geometry) "Vector (geometry)") quantity with both magnitude and [direction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direction_(geometry,_geography) "Direction (geometry, geography)"). In general, the vector measuring the difference between two locations (the [relative position](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_position "Relative position")) is sometimes called the **directed distance**.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance#cite_note-ittcKU-7) For example, the directed distance from the [New York City Main Library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Public_Library_Main_Branch "New York Public Library Main Branch") flag pole to the [Statue of Liberty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statue_of_Liberty "Statue of Liberty") flag pole has:

*   A starting point: library flag pole
*   An ending point: statue flag pole
*   A direction: -38°
*   A distance: 8.72 km

In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics") and its applications, the [signed distance function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signed_distance_function "Signed distance function") or signed distance field (SDF) is the [orthogonal distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_distance "Orthogonal distance") of a given point _x_ to the [boundary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(topology) "Boundary (topology)") of a [set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics) "Set (mathematics)") Ω in a [metric space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_space "Metric space") (such as the surface of a geometric shape), with the [sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_(mathematics) "Sign (mathematics)") determined by whether or not _x_ is in the [interior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interior_(topology) "Interior (topology)") of Ω. The [function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics) "Function (mathematics)") has positive values at points _x_ inside Ω, it decreases in value as _x_ approaches the boundary of Ω where the signed distance function is zero, and it takes negative values outside of Ω.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance#cite_note-8) However, the alternative convention is also sometimes taken instead (i.e., negative inside Ω and positive outside).[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance#cite_note-9) The concept also sometimes goes by the name oriented distance function/field.
