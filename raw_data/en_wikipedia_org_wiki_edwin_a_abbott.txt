Early life and education
------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Edwin_Abbott_Abbott&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Early life and education")]

Edwin Abbott Abbott was the eldest son of [Edwin Abbott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Abbott_(educator) "Edwin Abbott (educator)") (1808–1882), headmaster of the Philological School, [Marylebone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marylebone "Marylebone"), and his wife, Jane Abbott (1806–1882). His parents were first cousins.

He was born in London and educated at the [City of London School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_London_School "City of London School") and at [St John's College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_John%27s_College,_Cambridge "St John's College, Cambridge"), [Cambridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge "University of Cambridge"),[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_A._Abbott#cite_note-2) where he took the highest honours of his class in [classics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classics "Classics"), [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics") and [theology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theology "Theology"), and became a [fellow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fellow "Fellow") of his college. In particular, he was 1st [Smith's prizeman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith%27s_Prize "Smith's Prize") in 1861.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_A._Abbott#cite_note-3)[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_A._Abbott#cite_note-venn-error-4)

In 1862 he took orders. After holding masterships at [King Edward's School, Birmingham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Edward%27s_School,_Birmingham "King Edward's School, Birmingham"), he succeeded [G. F. Mortimer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Ferris_Whidborne_Mortimer "George Ferris Whidborne Mortimer") as headmaster of the [City of London School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_London_School "City of London School") in 1865, at the early age of 26. There, he oversaw the education of future Prime Minister [H. H. Asquith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._H._Asquith "H. H. Asquith"). Abbott was [Hulsean lecturer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulsean_Lectures "Hulsean Lectures") in 1876.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_A._Abbott#cite_note-EB1911-5)

He retired in 1889, and devoted himself to literary and theological pursuits. Abbott's open-minded inclinations in theology were prominent both in his educational views and in his books. His _[Shakespearian Grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shakespearian\_Grammar&action=edit&redlink=1 "Shakespearian Grammar (page does not exist)")_ (1870) is a permanent contribution to English [philology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philology "Philology"). In 1885, he published a life of [Francis Bacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Bacon_(philosopher) "Francis Bacon (philosopher)"). His theological writings include three anonymously published religious romances – _[Philochristus](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Philochristus&action=edit&redlink=1 "Philochristus (page does not exist)")_ (1878), where he tried to raise interest in [Gospels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel "Gospel") reading, _[Onesimus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onesimus\_(book) "Onesimus (book)")_ (1882), and _[Silanus the Christian](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Silanus\_the\_Christian&action=edit&redlink=1 "Silanus the Christian (page does not exist)")_ (1908).[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_A._Abbott#cite_note-EB1911-5)

More weighty contributions are the anonymous theological discussion _[The Kernel and the Husk](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The\_Kernel\_and\_the\_Husk "s:The Kernel and the Husk")_ (1886), _Philomythus_ (1891), his book _The Anglican Career of [Cardinal Newman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John\_Henry\_Newman "John Henry Newman")_ (1892), and his article "The Gospels" in the ninth edition of the _[Encyclopædia Britannica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A6dia\_Britannica "Encyclopædia Britannica")_, embodying a critical view which caused considerable stir in the English theological world. He also wrote _St Thomas of Canterbury, His Death and Miracles_ (1898), _Johannine Vocabulary_ (1905), and _Johannine Grammar_ (1906).[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_A._Abbott#cite_note-EB1911-5)

Abbott also wrote educational textbooks, one being _Via Latina: A First Latin Book_ which was published in 1880 and distributed around the world within the education system.

_Flatland_ title page, 1884

Abbott's best-known work is his 1884 novella _Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions_ which describes a two-dimensional world and explores the nature of dimensions. It has often been categorized as [science fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction "Science fiction") although it could more precisely be called "mathematical fiction".

With the advent of modern science fiction from the 1950s to the present day, _Flatland_ has seen a revival in popularity,[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_A._Abbott#cite_note-6) especially among [science fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction "Science fiction") and [cyberpunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk "Cyberpunk") fans.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_A._Abbott#cite_note-Harper_2010-7) Many works have been inspired by the novella, including novel sequels and short films.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_A._Abbott#cite_note-Harper_2010-7)
