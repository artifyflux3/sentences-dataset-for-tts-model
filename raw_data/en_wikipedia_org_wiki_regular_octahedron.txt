In [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry"), a **regular octahedron** is a highly symmetrical type of [octahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octahedron "Octahedron") (eight-sided [polyhedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyhedron "Polyhedron")) with eight [equilateral triangles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equilateral_triangle "Equilateral triangle") as its [faces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_(geometry) "Face (geometry)"), four of which meet at each [vertex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_(geometry) "Vertex (geometry)"). It is a type of [square bipyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_bipyramid "Square bipyramid") or [triangular antiprism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_antiprism "Triangular antiprism") with equal-length [edges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_(geometry) "Edge (geometry)"). Regular octahedra occur in nature as [crystal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal "Crystal") structures. Other types of octahedra also exist, with various amounts of symmetry.

A regular octahedron is the three-dimensional case of the more general concept of a [cross-polytope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-polytope "Cross-polytope").

The regular octahedron is one of the [Platonic solids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_solid "Platonic solid"), a set of [convex polyhedra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_polyhedron "Convex polyhedron") whose faces are [congruent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congruence_(geometry) "Congruence (geometry)")[regular polygons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_polygons "Regular polygons") and the same number of faces meet at each vertex.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_octahedron#cite_note-hs-1) This ancient set of polyhedrons was named after [Plato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato "Plato") who, in his [_Timaeus_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timaeus_(dialogue) "Timaeus (dialogue)") dialogue, related these solids to [classical elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_element "Classical element"), with the octahedron representing [wind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_(classical_element) "Wind (classical element)").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_octahedron#cite_note-cromwell-2) Following its attribution with nature by Plato, [Johannes Kepler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Kepler "Johannes Kepler") in his _[Harmonices Mundi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonices\_Mundi "Harmonices Mundi")_ sketched each of the Platonic solids.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_octahedron#cite_note-cromwell-2) In his _[Mysterium Cosmographicum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysterium\_Cosmographicum "Mysterium Cosmographicum")_, Kepler also proposed the [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System "Solar System") by using the Platonic solids setting into another one and separating them with six spheres resembling the six planets. The ordered solids started from the innermost to the outermost: regular octahedron, [regular icosahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_icosahedron "Regular icosahedron"), [regular dodecahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_dodecahedron "Regular dodecahedron"), [regular tetrahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_tetrahedron "Regular tetrahedron"), and [cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cube "Cube").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_octahedron#cite_note-livio-3)

The dual of a regular octahedron is cube

A regular octahedron is the [cross-polytope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-polytope "Cross-polytope") in 3-dimensional space. It can be oriented and scaled so that its axes align with [Cartesian coordinate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate "Cartesian coordinate") axes and its vertices have coordinates[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_octahedron#cite_note-smith-4)![Image 7: {\displaystyle (\pm 1,0,0),\qquad (0,\pm 1,0),\qquad (0,0,\pm 1).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4392889bc8e1cfd065afbf7352dcab702ec2a2ee) Such an octahedron has edge length ⁠![Image 8: {\displaystyle {\sqrt {2}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b4afc1e27d418021bf10898eb44a7f5f315735ff)⁠.

The regular octahedron's [dual polyhedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_polyhedron "Dual polyhedron") is the [cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cube "Cube"), and they have the same [three-dimensional symmetry groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_groups_in_three_dimensions "Point groups in three dimensions"), the octahedral symmetry ![Image 9: {\displaystyle \mathrm {O} _{\mathrm {h} }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d3c0a7669167dbe00f64525845a9c7bff1b39ef9).[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_octahedron#cite_note-erickson-5) Like its dual, the regular octahedron has three properties: any two faces, two vertices, and two edges are transformed by rotation and reflection under the symmetry orbit, such that the appearance remains unchanged; these are [isohedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isohedral "Isohedral"), [isogonal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isogonal_figure "Isogonal figure"), and [isotoxal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotoxal "Isotoxal") respectively. Hence, it is considered a [regular polyhedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_polyhedron "Regular polyhedron"). Four triangles surround each vertex, so the regular octahedron is ![Image 10: {\displaystyle 3.3.3.3}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/dd4a5fcdf3f8dd7e263b3048d6e1b08e74daefdb) by [vertex configuration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_configuration "Vertex configuration") or ![Image 11: {\displaystyle \{3,4\}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4ce803a141c2412f297a65b77a43d94ce3d17b27) by [Schläfli symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schl%C3%A4fli_symbol "Schläfli symbol").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_octahedron#cite_note-wd-6)

The [dihedral angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dihedral_angle "Dihedral angle") of a regular octahedron between two adjacent triangular faces is 109.47°. This can be obtained from the dihedral angle of an equilateral square pyramid: its dihedral angle between two adjacent triangular faces is the dihedral angle of an equilateral square pyramid between two adjacent triangular faces, and its dihedral angle between two adjacent triangular faces on the edge in which two equilateral square pyramids are attached is twice the dihedral angle of an equilateral square pyramid between its triangular face and its square base.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_octahedron#cite_note-johnson-9)

As other special cases

The regular octahedron is one of the eight convex [deltahedra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deltahedron "Deltahedron"), polyhedra whose faces are all [equilateral triangles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equilateral_triangles "Equilateral triangles").[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_octahedron#cite_note-trigg-10)

A regular octahedron is a type of square [bipyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipyramid "Bipyramid"),[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_octahedron#cite_note-oh-11) a [composite polyhedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_polyhedron "Composite polyhedron") constructed by attaching two [equilateral square pyramids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equilateral_square_pyramid "Equilateral square pyramid") base-to-base.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_octahedron#cite_note-timofeenko-2010-12)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_octahedron#cite_note-erickson-5) The [dual polyhedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_polyhedron "Dual polyhedron") of a bipyramid in general is the [prism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prism_(geometry) "Prism (geometry)"), and vice versa; the regular octahedron's dual, the cube, is a type of [square prism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_prism "Square prism").[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_octahedron#cite_note-sibley-13)

The regular octahedron is a type of trigonal [antiprism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiprism "Antiprism"),[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_octahedron#cite_note-FOOTNOTEO'KeeffeHyde2020[httpsbooksgooglecombooksid_MjPDwAAQBAJpgPA141_141]-14) formed by taking a trigonal [prism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prism_(geometry) "Prism (geometry)") with equilateral triangle bases and rectangular lateral faces, and replacing the rectangles by alternating isosceles triangles. In the case of the regular octahedron, all of the resulting faces are congruent equilateral triangles.

The regular octahedron can also be considered a [rectified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectification_(geometry) "Rectification (geometry)") tetrahedron, sometimes called a **tetratetrahedron** (by analogy to the [cuboctahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuboctahedron "Cuboctahedron") and [icosidodecahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icosidodecahedron "Icosidodecahedron")); if alternate faces are considered to have different types (e.g. different colors or orientations), the octahedron can be considered a type of [quasiregular polyhedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasiregular_polyhedron "Quasiregular polyhedron"), a polyhedron in which two different types of polygonal faces alternate around each vertex.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_octahedron#cite_note-maekawa-15) It exists in a sequence of symmetries of quasiregular polyhedra and tilings with [vertex configurations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_configuration "Vertex configuration") (3._n_)2, progressing from tilings of the sphere to the Euclidean plane and into the hyperbolic plane.

The graph of a regular octahedron

The [skeleton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_of_a_polytope "Graph of a polytope") of a regular octahedron can be represented as a [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics) "Graph (discrete mathematics)") according to [Steinitz's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steinitz%27s_theorem "Steinitz's theorem"), provided the graph is [planar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planar_graph "Planar graph")—its edges of a graph are connected to every vertex without crossing other edges—and [3-connected graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-vertex-connected_graph "K-vertex-connected graph")—its edges remain connected whenever two of more three vertices of a graph are removed.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_octahedron#cite_note-grunbaum-2003-18)[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_octahedron#cite_note-ziegler-19) Its graph called the **octahedral graph**, a [Platonic graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_graph "Platonic graph").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_octahedron#cite_note-hs-1)

The octahedral graph can be considered as [complete tripartite graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripartite_graph "Tripartite graph")![Image 32: {\displaystyle K_{2,2,2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5f99b4e5aecb9c77dfe6bc3bbab2b8da37079fd0), a graph partitioned into three independent sets, each consisting of two opposite vertices.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_octahedron#cite_note-negami-20) More generally, it is a [Turán graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tur%C3%A1n_graph "Turán graph")![Image 33: {\displaystyle T_{6,3}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/477fd35a24a2105dcee87a08eefd5dae4ee93e48).

The octahedral graph is [4-connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-vertex-connected_graph "K-vertex-connected graph"), meaning that it takes the removal of four vertices to disconnect the remaining vertices. It is one of only four 4-connected [simplicial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplicial_polytope "Simplicial polytope")[well-covered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-covered_graph "Well-covered graph") polyhedra, meaning that all of the [maximal independent sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximal_independent_set "Maximal independent set") of its vertices have the same size. The other three polyhedra with this property are the [pentagonal dipyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagonal_dipyramid "Pentagonal dipyramid"), the [snub disphenoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snub_disphenoid "Snub disphenoid"), and an irregular polyhedron with 12 vertices and 20 triangular faces.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_octahedron#cite_note-fhnp-21)

The interior of the [compound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyhedral_compound "Polyhedral compound") of two dual [tetrahedra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahedra "Tetrahedra") is an octahedron, and this compound—called the [stella octangula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stella_octangula "Stella octangula")—is its first and only [stellation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellation "Stellation").[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_octahedron#cite_note-FOOTNOTECromwell1997171,_261-22) Correspondingly, a regular octahedron is the result of cutting off from a regular tetrahedron, four regular tetrahedra of half the linear size (i.e. [rectifying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectification_(geometry) "Rectification (geometry)") the tetrahedron). The vertices of the octahedron lie at the midpoints of the edges of the tetrahedron, and in this sense, it relates to the tetrahedron in the same way that the [cuboctahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuboctahedron "Cuboctahedron") and [icosidodecahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icosidodecahedron "Icosidodecahedron") relate to the other Platonic solids.

Several constructions of polyhedra commence from the regular octahedron. The [truncated octahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truncated_octahedron "Truncated octahedron") is an [Archimedean solid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedean_solid "Archimedean solid"), constructed by removing all of the regular octahedron's vertices, resulting in six squares and eight hexagons, leaving out six square pyramids.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_octahedron#cite_note-diudea-23) The [triakis octahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triakis_octahedron "Triakis octahedron") is a [Catalan solid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_solid "Catalan solid"), the [Kleetope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleetope "Kleetope") of a regular octahedron, by attaching triangular pyramids onto its faces, [topologically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology "Topology") similar to the stellated octahedron.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_octahedron#cite_note-bpv-24) The uniform [tetrahemihexahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahemihexahedron "Tetrahemihexahedron") is a [tetrahedral symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahedral_symmetry "Tetrahedral symmetry")[faceting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faceting "Faceting") of the regular octahedron, sharing [edge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_arrangement "Edge arrangement") and [vertex arrangement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_arrangement "Vertex arrangement"). It has four of the triangular faces and three central squares.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_octahedron#cite_note-pmtsgsd-25)

One can also divide the edges of an octahedron in the ratio of the [golden mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio "Golden ratio") to define the vertices of a [regular icosahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_icosahedron "Regular icosahedron"). This is done by first placing vectors along the octahedron's edges such that each face is bounded by a cycle, then similarly partitioning each edge into the golden mean along the direction of its vector. Five octahedra define any given icosahedron in this fashion, and together they define a regular compound. A regular icosahedron produced this way is called a "snub octahedron".[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_octahedron#cite_note-kappraff-26)

Characteristic orthoscheme
--------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Regular_octahedron&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Characteristic orthoscheme")]

Like all regular convex polytopes, the octahedron can be [dissected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection_into_orthoschemes "Dissection into orthoschemes") into an integral number of disjoint [orthoschemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthoscheme "Orthoscheme"), all of the same shape characteristic of the polytope. A polytope's [characteristic orthoscheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthoscheme#Characteristic_simplex_of_the_general_regular_polytope "Orthoscheme") is a [fundamental](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_domain "Fundamental domain") property because the polytope is generated by reflections in the [facets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facet_(geometry) "Facet (geometry)") of its orthoscheme. The orthoscheme occurs in two [chiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiral "Chiral") forms which are mirror images of each other. The characteristic orthoscheme of a regular polyhedron is a [quadrirectangular irregular tetrahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahedron#Orthoschemes "Tetrahedron").

The faces of the octahedron's characteristic tetrahedron lie in the octahedron's mirror planes of [symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry_(geometry) "Symmetry (geometry)"). The octahedron is unique among the Platonic solids in having an even number of faces meeting at each vertex. Consequently, it is the only member of that group to possess, among its mirror planes, some that do not pass through any of its faces. The octahedron's [symmetry group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coxeter_group "Coxeter group") is denoted [B 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octahedral_symmetry "Octahedral symmetry"). The octahedron and its [dual polytope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_polytope "Dual polytope"), the [cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cube "Cube"), have the same symmetry group but different characteristic tetrahedra.

The **characteristic tetrahedron of the regular octahedron** can be found by a canonical dissection[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_octahedron#cite_note-FOOTNOTECoxeter1973130%C2%A77.6_The_symmetry_group_of_the_general_regular_polytope-36) of the regular octahedron ![Image 43](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/CDel_node_1.png)![Image 44](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/CDel_3.png)![Image 45](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/CDel_node.png)![Image 46](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8c/CDel_4.png)![Image 47](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/CDel_node.png) which subdivides it into 48 of these characteristic orthoschemes ![Image 48](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/CDel_node.png)![Image 49](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/CDel_3.png)![Image 50](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/CDel_node.png)![Image 51](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8c/CDel_4.png)![Image 52](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/CDel_node.png) surrounding the octahedron's center. Three left-handed orthoschemes and three right-handed orthoschemes meet in each of the octahedron's eight faces, the six orthoschemes collectively forming a [trirectangular tetrahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahedron#Trirectangular_tetrahedron "Tetrahedron"): a triangular pyramid with the octahedron face as its equilateral base, and its cube-cornered apex at the center of the octahedron.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_octahedron#cite_note-FOOTNOTECoxeter197370%E2%80%9371Characteristic_tetrahedra;_Fig._4.7A-37)
