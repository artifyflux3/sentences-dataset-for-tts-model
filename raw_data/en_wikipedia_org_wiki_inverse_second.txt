SI units 1 Hz The inverse second or reciprocal second ( s −1 ), also called per second , is a unit defined as the multiplicative inverse of the second (a unit of time ). It is applicable for physical quantities of dimension reciprocal time , such as frequency and strain rate .

It is dimensionally equivalent to: hertz (Hz), historically known as cycles per second – the SI unit for frequency and rotational frequency becquerel (Bq) – the SI unit for the rate of occurrence of aperiodic or stochastic radionuclide events baud (Bd) – the unit for symbol rate over a communication link bit per second (bit/s) – the unit of bit rate However, the special names and symbols above for s −1 are recommend for clarity.

[ a ] [ b ] Reciprocal second should not be confused with radian per second (rad⋅s −1 ), the SI unit for angular frequency and angular velocity . As the radian is a dimensionless unit , radian per second is dimensionally consistent with reciprocal second. However, they are used for different kinds of quantity , frequency and angular frequency, whose numerical value differs by 2 π .

The inverse minute or reciprocal minute ( min −1 ), also called per minute , is 60 −1 s −1 , as 1 min = 60 s; it is used in quantities of type " counts per minute", such as: Actions per minute Beats per minute Counts per minute Revolutions per minute (rpm) Words per minute Inverse square second (s −2 ) is involved in the units of linear acceleration , angular acceleration , and rotational acceleration .

Although it would be formally correct to write all three of these units as the reciprocal second, the use of the different names emphasises the different nature of the quantities concerned." [ 1 ] ^ "(d) The hertz is used only for periodic phenomena, and the becquerel (Bq) is used only for stochastic processes in activity referred to a radionuclide."
