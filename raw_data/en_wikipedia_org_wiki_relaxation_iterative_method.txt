For other uses, see Relaxation (disambiguation) .

In numerical mathematics , relaxation methods are iterative methods for solving systems of equations , including nonlinear systems.

[ 1 ] Relaxation methods were developed for solving large sparse linear systems , which arose as finite-difference discretizations of differential equations .

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] They are also used for the solution of linear equations for linear least-squares problems [ 4 ] and also for systems of linear inequalities, such as those arising in linear programming .

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] They have also been developed for solving nonlinear systems of equations.

[ 1 ] Relaxation methods are important especially in the solution of linear systems used to model elliptic partial differential equations , such as Laplace's equation and its generalization, Poisson's equation . These equations describe boundary-value problems , in which the solution-function's values are specified on boundary of a domain; the problem is to compute a solution also on its interior. Relaxation methods are used to solve the linear equations resulting from a discretization of the differential equation, for example by finite differences.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Iterative relaxation of solutions is commonly dubbed smoothing because with certain equations, such as Laplace's equation , it resembles repeated application of a local smoothing filter to the solution vector.  These are not to be confused with relaxation methods in mathematical optimization , which approximate a difficult problem by a simpler problem whose "relaxed" solution provides information about the solution of the original problem.

[ 7 ] Model problem of potential theory [ edit ] Main article: Discrete Poisson equation When φ is a smooth real-valued function on the real numbers, its second derivative can be approximated by: d 2 φ φ ( x ) d x 2 = φ φ ( x − − h ) − − 2 φ φ ( x ) + φ φ ( x + h ) h 2 + O ( h 2 ) .

{\displaystyle {\frac {d^{2}\varphi (x)}{{dx}^{2}}}={\frac {\varphi (x{-}h)-2\varphi (x)+\varphi (x{+}h)}{h^{2}}}\,+\,{\mathcal {O}}(h^{2})\,.} Using this in both dimensions for a function φ of two arguments at the point ( x , y ), and solving for φ( x , y ), results in: φ φ ( x , y ) = 1 4 ( φ φ ( x + h , y ) + φ φ ( x , y + h ) + φ φ ( x − − h , y ) + φ φ ( x , y − − h ) − − h 2 ∇ ∇ 2 φ φ ( x , y ) ) + O ( h 4 ) .

{\displaystyle \varphi (x,y)={\tfrac {1}{4}}\left(\varphi (x{+}h,y)+\varphi (x,y{+}h)+\varphi (x{-}h,y)+\varphi (x,y{-}h)\,-\,h^{2}{\nabla }^{2}\varphi (x,y)\right)\,+\,{\mathcal {O}}(h^{4})\,.} To approximate the solution of the Poisson equation: ∇ ∇ 2 φ φ = f {\displaystyle {\nabla }^{2}\varphi =f\,} numerically on a two-dimensional grid with grid spacing h , the relaxation method assigns the given values of function φ to the grid points near the boundary and arbitrary values to the interior grid points, and then repeatedly performs the assignment
φ := φ* on the interior points, where φ* is defined by: φ φ ∗ ∗ ( x , y ) = 1 4 ( φ φ ( x + h , y ) + φ φ ( x , y + h ) + φ φ ( x − − h , y ) + φ φ ( x , y − − h ) − − h 2 f ( x , y ) ) , {\displaystyle \varphi ^{*}(x,y)={\tfrac {1}{4}}\left(\varphi (x{+}h,y)+\varphi (x,y{+}h)+\varphi (x{-}h,y)+\varphi (x,y{-}h)\,-\,h^{2}f(x,y)\right)\,,} until convergence.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] The method [ 2 ] [ 3 ] is easily generalized to other numbers of dimensions.

Convergence and acceleration [ edit ] While the method converges under general conditions, it typically makes slower progress than competing methods. Nonetheless, the study of relaxation methods remains a core part of linear algebra , because the transformations of relaxation theory provide excellent preconditioners for new methods. Indeed, the choice of preconditioner is often more important than the choice of iterative method.

[ 8 ] Multigrid methods may be used to accelerate the methods. One can first compute an approximation on a coarser grid – usually the double spacing 2 h – and use that solution with interpolated values for the other grid points as the initial assignment. This can then also be done recursively for the coarser computation.

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] See also [ edit ] In linear systems, the two main classes of relaxation methods are stationary iterative methods , and the more general Krylov subspace methods .

The Jacobi method is a simple relaxation method.

The Gauss–Seidel method is an improvement upon the Jacobi method.

Successive over-relaxation can be applied to either of the Jacobi and Gauss–Seidel methods to speed convergence.
