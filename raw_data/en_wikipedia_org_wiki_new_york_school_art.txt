The New York School was an informal group of American poets, painters, dancers, and musicians active in the 1950s and 1960s in New York City. They often drew inspiration from surrealism and the contemporary avant-garde art movements, in particular action painting , abstract expressionism , jazz , improvisational theater, experimental music , and the interaction of friends in the New York City art world's vanguard circle .

People [ edit ] Frank O'Hara was at the center of the group before his death in 1966. Because of his numerous friendships and his post as a curator at the Museum of Modern Art , he provided connections between the poets and painters such as Jane Freilicher , Fairfield Porter , and Larry Rivers (who was O'Hara's lover). There were many joint works and collaborations, particularly between poets such as O'Hara, Kenneth Koch , John Ashbery , and James Schuyler : Rivers inspired a play by Koch, Koch and Ashbery together wrote the poem "A Postcard to Popeye", Ashbery and Schuyler wrote the novel A Nest of Ninnies , and Schuyler collaborated on an ode with O'Hara, whose portrait was painted by Rivers.

[ 1 ] Ron Padgett , Dick Gallup , Joe Brainard , and Ted Berrigan came to the group from Tulsa, Oklahoma .

Koch, O'Hara, Schuyler, and Ashbery were quite different as poets, but they admired each other and had much in common personally: [ 1 ] Except for Schuyler, all overlapped at Harvard University , Except for Ashbery, all did military service, Except for Koch, all reviewed art, Except for Ashbery, all lived in New York during their formative years as poets.

All four were inspired by French Surrealists such as Raymond Roussel , Pierre Reverdy , and Guillaume Apollinaire .

David Lehman , in his book on the New York poets, wrote: "They favored wit, humor and the advanced irony of the blague (that is, the insolent prank or jest) in ways more suggestive of Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg than of the New York School abstract expressionist painters after whom they were named." [ 1 ] Poetry [ edit ] Concerning the New York School poets, critics argued that their work was a reaction to the Confessionalist movement in Contemporary Poetry.  Their poetic subject matter was often light, violent, or observational, while their writing style was often described as cosmopolitan and world-traveled.

The poets often wrote in an immediate and spontaneous manner reminiscent of stream of consciousness writing, often using vivid imagery. They drew on inspiration from Surrealism and the contemporary avant-garde art movements, in particular the action painting of their friends in the New York City art world circle such as Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning .

Poets often associated with the New York School include John Ashbery , Frank O'Hara , Joe Brainard , Kenneth Koch , James Schuyler , Barbara Guest , Ted Berrigan , Bernadette Mayer , Alice Notley , Anne Waldman , Tom Clark , Clark Coolidge , David Shapiro , David Lehman , Amy Gerstler , Terence Winch , Lorenzo Thomas , Ted Greenwald , Eileen Myles , Kenward Elmslie , John Giorno , Barbara Barg , Jerome Sala , Elaine Equi , Frank Lima , Ron Padgett , Lewis Warsh , Tom Savage and Joseph Ceravolo .
