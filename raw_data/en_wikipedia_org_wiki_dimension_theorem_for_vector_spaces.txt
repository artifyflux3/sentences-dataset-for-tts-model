This number of elements may be finite or infinite (in the latter case, it is a cardinal number ), and defines the dimension of the vector space.

Formally, the dimension theorem for vector spaces states that: Given a vector space V , any two bases have the same cardinality .

As a basis is a generating set that is linearly independent , the dimension theorem is a consequence of the following theorem , which is also useful: In a vector space V , if G is a generating set, and I is a linearly independent set, then the cardinality of I is not larger than the cardinality of G .

In particular if V is finitely generated , then all its bases are finite and have the  same number of elements.

While the proof of the existence of a basis for any vector space in the general case requires Zorn's lemma and is in fact equivalent to the axiom of choice , the uniqueness of the cardinality of the basis requires only the ultrafilter lemma , [ 1 ] which is strictly weaker (the proof given below, however, assumes trichotomy , i.e., that all cardinal numbers are comparable, a statement which is also equivalent to the axiom of choice). The theorem can be generalized to arbitrary R -modules for rings R having invariant basis number .

In the finitely generated case the proof uses only elementary arguments of algebra , and does not require the axiom of choice nor its weaker variants.

Proof [ edit ] Let V be a vector space, { a i : i ∈ I } be a linearly independent set of elements of V , and { b j : j ∈ J } be a generating set . One has to prove that the cardinality of I is not larger than that of J .

If J is finite, this results from the Steinitz exchange lemma . (Indeed, the Steinitz exchange lemma implies every finite subset of I has cardinality not larger than that of J , hence I is finite with cardinality not larger than that of J .) If J is finite, a proof based on matrix theory is also possible.

[ 2 ] Assume that J is infinite. If I is finite, there is nothing to prove. Thus, we may assume that I is also infinite. Let us suppose that the cardinality of I is larger than that of J .

[ note 1 ] We have to prove that this leads to a contradiction.

By Zorn's lemma , every linearly independent set is contained in a maximal linearly independent set K . This maximality implies that K spans V and is therefore a basis (the maximality implies that every element of V is linearly dependent from the elements of K , and therefore is a linear combination of elements of K ). As the cardinality of K is greater than or equal to the cardinality of I , one may replace { a i : i ∈ I } with K , that is, one may suppose, without loss of generality , that { a i : i ∈ I } is a basis.

Thus, every b j can be written as a finite sum b j = ∑ ∑ i ∈ ∈ E j λ λ i , j a i , {\displaystyle b_{j}=\sum _{i\in E_{j}}\lambda _{i,j}a_{i},} where E j {\displaystyle E_{j}} is a finite subset of I .

{\displaystyle I.} As J is infinite, ⋃ ⋃ j ∈ ∈ J E j {\textstyle \bigcup _{j\in J}E_{j}} has the same cardinality as J .

[ note 1 ] Therefore ⋃ ⋃ j ∈ ∈ J E j {\textstyle \bigcup _{j\in J}E_{j}} has cardinality smaller than that of I . So there is some i 0 ∈ ∈ I {\displaystyle i_{0}\in I} which does not appear in any E j {\displaystyle E_{j}} .  The corresponding a i 0 {\displaystyle a_{i_{0}}} can be expressed as a finite linear combination of b j {\displaystyle b_{j}} s, which in turn can be expressed as finite linear combination of a i {\displaystyle a_{i}} s, not involving a i 0 {\displaystyle a_{i_{0}}} . Hence a i 0 {\displaystyle a_{i_{0}}} is linearly dependent on the other a i {\displaystyle a_{i}} s, which provides the desired contradiction.

Kernel extension theorem for vector spaces [ edit ] This application of the dimension theorem is sometimes itself called the dimension theorem . Let T : U → V be a linear transformation . Then dim(range( T )) + dim(ker( T )) = dim( U ) , that is, the dimension of U is equal to the dimension of the transformation's range plus the dimension of the kernel . See rank–nullity theorem for a fuller discussion.
