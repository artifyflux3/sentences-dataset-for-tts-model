A [parabola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabola "Parabola"), one of the simplest curves, after (straight) lines

In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), a **curve** (also called a **curved line** in older texts) is an object similar to a [line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_(geometry) "Line (geometry)"), but that does not have to be [straight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linearity "Linearity").

Intuitively, a curve may be thought of as the trace left by a moving [point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(geometry) "Point (geometry)"). This is the definition that appeared more than 2000 years ago in [Euclid's _Elements_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_Elements "Euclid's Elements"): "The [curved] line[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_curve#cite_note-1) is […] the first species of quantity, which has only one dimension, namely length, without any width nor depth, and is nothing else than the flow or run of the point which […] will leave from its imaginary moving some vestige in length, exempt of any width."[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_curve#cite_note-2)

This definition of a curve has been formalized in modern mathematics as: _A curve is the [image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image\_(mathematics) "Image (mathematics)") of an [interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval\_(mathematics) "Interval (mathematics)") to a [topological space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological\_space "Topological space") by a [continuous function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous\_function "Continuous function")_. In some contexts, the function that defines the curve is called a _parametrization_, and the curve is a [parametric curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_curve "Parametric curve"). In this article, these curves are sometimes called _topological curves_ to distinguish them from more constrained curves such as [differentiable curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_curve "Differentiable curve"). This definition encompasses most curves that are studied in mathematics; notable exceptions are [level curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_curve "Level curve") (which are [unions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_(set_theory) "Union (set theory)") of curves and isolated points), and [algebraic curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_curve "Algebraic curve") (see below). Level curves and algebraic curves are sometimes called [implicit curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_curve "Implicit curve"), since they are generally defined by [implicit equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_equation "Implicit equation").

Nevertheless, the class of topological curves is very broad, and contains some curves that do not look as one may expect for a curve, or even cannot be drawn. This is the case of [space-filling curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-filling_curve "Space-filling curve") and [fractal curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal_curve "Fractal curve"). For ensuring more regularity, the function that defines a curve is often supposed to be [differentiable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_function "Differentiable function"), and the curve is then said to be a [differentiable curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_curve "Differentiable curve").

A [plane algebraic curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_algebraic_curve "Plane algebraic curve") is the [zero set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_set "Zero set") of a [polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial "Polynomial") in two [indeterminates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indeterminate_(variable) "Indeterminate (variable)"). More generally, an [algebraic curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_curve "Algebraic curve") is the zero set of a finite set of polynomials, which satisfies the further condition of being an [algebraic variety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_variety "Algebraic variety") of [dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension_of_an_algebraic_variety "Dimension of an algebraic variety") one. If the coefficients of the polynomials belong to a [field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics) "Field (mathematics)")k, the curve is said to be _defined over_ k. In the common case of a [real algebraic curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_algebraic_curve "Real algebraic curve"), where k is the field of [real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number"), an algebraic curve is a finite union of topological curves. When [complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number "Complex number") zeros are considered, one has a _complex algebraic curve_, which, from the [topological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology "Topology") point of view, is not a curve, but a [surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(mathematics) "Surface (mathematics)"), and is often called a [Riemann surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_surface "Riemann surface"). Although not being curves in the common sense, algebraic curves defined over other fields have been widely studied. In particular, algebraic curves over a [finite field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_field "Finite field") are widely used in modern [cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography "Cryptography").

[Megalithic art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megalithic_art "Megalithic art") from [Newgrange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newgrange "Newgrange") showing an early interest in curves

Interest in curves began long before they were the subject of mathematical study. This can be seen in numerous examples of their decorative use in art and on everyday objects dating back to prehistoric times.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_curve#cite_note-Lockwood-3) Curves, or at least their graphical representations, are simple to create, for example with a stick on the sand on a beach.

Historically, the term _line_ was used in place of the more modern term _curve_. Hence the terms _straight line_ and _right line_ were used to distinguish what are today called lines from curved lines. For example, in Book I of [Euclid's Elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_Elements "Euclid's Elements"), a line is defined as a "breadthless length" (Def. 2), while a _straight_ line is defined as "a line that lies evenly with the points on itself" (Def. 4). Euclid's idea of a line is perhaps clarified by the statement "The extremities of a line are points," (Def. 3).[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_curve#cite_note-4) Later commentators further classified lines according to various schemes. For example:[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_curve#cite_note-5)

*   Composite lines (lines forming an angle)
*   Incomposite lines 
    *   Determinate (lines that do not extend indefinitely, such as the circle)
    *   Indeterminate (lines that extend indefinitely, such as the straight line and the parabola)

[![Image 3](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/Conic_sections_with_plane.svg/250px-Conic_sections_with_plane.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Conic_sections_with_plane.svg)

The curves created by slicing a cone ([conic sections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conic_section "Conic section")) were among the curves studied in ancient [Greek mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_mathematics "Greek mathematics").

The Greek [geometers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometers "Geometers") had studied many other kinds of curves. One reason was their interest in solving geometrical problems that could not be solved using standard [compass and straightedge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compass_and_straightedge "Compass and straightedge") construction. These curves include:

*   The conic sections, studied in depth by [Apollonius of Perga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollonius_of_Perga "Apollonius of Perga")
*   The [cissoid of Diocles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cissoid_of_Diocles "Cissoid of Diocles"), studied by [Diocles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocles_(mathematician) "Diocles (mathematician)") and used as a method to [double the cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubling_the_cube "Doubling the cube").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_curve#cite_note-6)
*   The [conchoid of Nicomedes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conchoid_of_Nicomedes "Conchoid of Nicomedes"), studied by [Nicomedes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicomedes_(mathematician) "Nicomedes (mathematician)") as a method to both double the cube and to [trisect an angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle_trisection "Angle trisection").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_curve#cite_note-7)
*   The [Archimedean spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedean_spiral "Archimedean spiral"), studied by [Archimedes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes "Archimedes") as a method to trisect an angle and [square the circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squaring_the_circle "Squaring the circle").[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_curve#cite_note-8)
*   The [spiric sections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiric_section "Spiric section"), sections of [tori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torus "Torus") studied by [Perseus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perseus_(geometer) "Perseus (geometer)") as sections of cones had been studied by Apollonius.

[![Image 4](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Folium_Of_Descartes.svg/250px-Folium_Of_Descartes.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Folium_Of_Descartes.svg)

Analytic geometry allowed curves, such as the [Folium of Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folium_of_Descartes "Folium of Descartes"), to be defined using equations instead of geometrical construction.

A fundamental advance in the theory of curves was the introduction of [analytic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_geometry "Analytic geometry") by [René Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes "René Descartes") in the seventeenth century. This enabled a curve to be described using an equation rather than an elaborate geometrical construction. This not only allowed new curves to be defined and studied, but it enabled a formal distinction to be made between [algebraic curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_curve "Algebraic curve") that can be defined using [polynomial equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_equation "Polynomial equation"), and [transcendental curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendental_curve "Transcendental curve") that cannot. Previously, curves had been described as "geometrical" or "mechanical" according to how they were, or supposedly could be, generated.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_curve#cite_note-Lockwood-3)

Conic sections were applied in [astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy "Astronomy") by [Kepler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Kepler "Johannes Kepler").

Newton also worked on an early example in the [calculus of variations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_of_variations "Calculus of variations"). Solutions to variational problems, such as the [brachistochrone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brachistochrone "Brachistochrone") and [tautochrone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tautochrone "Tautochrone") questions, introduced properties of curves in new ways (in this case, the [cycloid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycloid "Cycloid")). The [catenary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catenary "Catenary") gets its name as the solution to the problem of a hanging chain, the sort of question that became routinely accessible by means of [differential calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_calculus "Differential calculus").

In the eighteenth century came the beginnings of the theory of plane algebraic curves, in general. Newton had studied the [cubic curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_curve "Cubic curve"), in the general description of the real points into 'ovals'. The statement of [Bézout's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zout%27s_theorem "Bézout's theorem") showed a number of aspects which were not directly accessible to the geometry of the time, to do with singular points and complex solutions.

Since the nineteenth century, curve theory is viewed as the special case of dimension one of the theory of [manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold "Manifold") and [algebraic varieties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_varieties "Algebraic varieties"). Nevertheless, many questions remain specific to curves, such as [space-filling curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-filling_curve "Space-filling curve"), [Jordan curve theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_curve_theorem "Jordan curve theorem") and [Hilbert's sixteenth problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_sixteenth_problem "Hilbert's sixteenth problem").

A **topological curve** can be specified by a [continuous function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function_(topology) "Continuous function (topology)")![Image 5: {\displaystyle \gamma \colon I\rightarrow X}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3449e529dba68d61e3a773eb4b728943a96064fb) from an [interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics) "Interval (mathematics)")I of the [real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number") into a [topological space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space "Topological space")X. Properly speaking, the _curve_ is the [image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_(mathematics) "Image (mathematics)") of ![Image 6: {\displaystyle \gamma .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f423d4c0d1a3f651562797e2198c75a3f65e09fe) However, in some contexts, ![Image 7: {\displaystyle \gamma }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a223c880b0ce3da8f64ee33c4f0010beee400b1a) itself is called a curve, especially when the image does not look like what is generally called a curve and does not characterize sufficiently ![Image 8: {\displaystyle \gamma .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f423d4c0d1a3f651562797e2198c75a3f65e09fe)

For example, the image of the [Peano curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_curve "Peano curve") or, more generally, a [space-filling curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-filling_curve "Space-filling curve") completely fills a square, and therefore does not give any information on how ![Image 9: {\displaystyle \gamma }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a223c880b0ce3da8f64ee33c4f0010beee400b1a) is defined.

A curve ![Image 10: {\displaystyle \gamma }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a223c880b0ce3da8f64ee33c4f0010beee400b1a) is **closed**[[b]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_curve#cite_note-9) or is a _[loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop\_(topology) "Loop (topology)")_ if ![Image 11: {\displaystyle I=[a,b]}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6d6214bb3ce7f00e496c0706edd1464ac60b73b5) and ![Image 12: {\displaystyle \gamma (a)=\gamma (b)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/71ac2ef951801792f1a6e48a81dfacb178abeb71). A closed curve is thus the image of a continuous mapping of a [circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle "Circle"). A non-closed curve may also be called an _**open curve**_.

If the [domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_of_a_function "Domain of a function") of a topological curve is a closed and bounded interval ![Image 13: {\displaystyle I=[a,b]}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6d6214bb3ce7f00e496c0706edd1464ac60b73b5), the curve is called a _[path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path\_(topology) "Path (topology)")_, also known as _topological arc_ (or just **arc**).

A curve is **simple** if it is the image of an interval or a circle by an [injective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injective "Injective") continuous function. In other words, if a curve is defined by a continuous function ![Image 14: {\displaystyle \gamma }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a223c880b0ce3da8f64ee33c4f0010beee400b1a) with an interval as a domain, the curve is simple if and only if any two different points of the interval have different images, except, possibly, if the points are the endpoints of the interval. Intuitively, a simple curve is a curve that "does not cross itself and has no missing points" (a continuous non-self-intersecting curve).[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_curve#cite_note-10)

[Helix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helix "Helix") is an example of a skew curve.

A _[plane curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane\_curve "Plane curve")_ is a curve for which ![Image 16: {\displaystyle X}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab) is the [Euclidean plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_plane "Euclidean plane")—these are the examples first encountered—or in some cases the [projective plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_plane "Projective plane"). A **_space curve_** is a curve for which ![Image 17: {\displaystyle X}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab) is at least [three-dimensional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional "Three-dimensional"); a **_skew curve_** is a space curve which lies in no plane (for example, a [helix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helix "Helix")). These definitions of plane, space and skew curves apply also to [real algebraic curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_algebraic_geometry "Real algebraic geometry"), although the above definition of a curve does not apply (a real algebraic curve may be [disconnected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_space "Connected space")).

[![Image 18](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/Fractal_dragon_curve.jpg/250px-Fractal_dragon_curve.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Fractal_dragon_curve.jpg)

A [dragon curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_curve "Dragon curve") with a positive area

A plane simple closed curve is also called a **Jordan curve**. It is also defined as a non-self-intersecting [continuous loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_(topology) "Loop (topology)") in the plane.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_curve#cite_note-11) The [Jordan curve theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_curve_theorem "Jordan curve theorem") states that the [set complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_complement "Set complement") in a plane of a Jordan curve consists of two [connected components](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_component_(topology) "Connected component (topology)") (that is the curve divides the plane in two non-intersecting [regions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region_(mathematics) "Region (mathematics)") that are both connected). The bounded region inside a Jordan curve is known as **Jordan domain**.

The definition of a curve includes figures that can hardly be called curves in common usage. For example, the image of a curve can cover a [square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_(geometry) "Square (geometry)") in the plane ([space-filling curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-filling_curve "Space-filling curve")), and a simple curve may have a positive area.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_curve#cite_note-12)[Fractal curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal_curve "Fractal curve") can have properties that are strange for the common sense. For example, a fractal curve can have a [Hausdorff dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_dimension "Hausdorff dimension") bigger than one (see [Koch snowflake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_snowflake "Koch snowflake")) and even a positive area. An example is the [dragon curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_curve "Dragon curve"), which has many other unusual properties.

Differentiable curve
--------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Curve&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Differentiable curve")]

Roughly speaking a _differentiable curve_ is a curve that is defined as being locally the image of an injective differentiable function ![Image 19: {\displaystyle \gamma \colon I\rightarrow X}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3449e529dba68d61e3a773eb4b728943a96064fb) from an [interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics) "Interval (mathematics)")I of the [real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number") into a differentiable manifold X, often ![Image 20: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/76ef548febfc9981762740107858be9e3a5576c3)

More precisely, a differentiable curve is a subset C of X where every point of C has a neighborhood U such that ![Image 21: {\displaystyle C\cap U}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4987569a55848940928bc9934c9fd2a16868025c) is [diffeomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffeomorphism "Diffeomorphism") to an interval of the real numbers.[_[clarification needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please\_clarify "Wikipedia:Please clarify")_] In other words, a differentiable curve is a differentiable manifold of dimension one.

"Arc (geometry)" redirects here. For the use in finite projective geometry, see [Arc (projective geometry)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc_(projective_geometry) "Arc (projective geometry)"). For use in circles specifically, see [Circular arc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_arc "Circular arc").

In [Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry "Euclidean geometry"), an **arc** (symbol: **⌒**) is a [connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_set "Connected set") subset of a [differentiable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_function "Differentiable function") curve.

Arcs of [lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_(geometry) "Line (geometry)") are called [segments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_segment "Line segment"), [rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_(geometry) "Ray (geometry)"), or [lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_(geometry) "Line (geometry)"), depending on how they are bounded.

A common curved example is an arc of a [circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle "Circle"), called a [circular arc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_arc "Circular arc").

In a [sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere "Sphere") (or a [spheroid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spheroid "Spheroid")), an arc of a [great circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_circle "Great circle") (or a [great ellipse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_ellipse "Great ellipse")) is called a **great arc**.

If ![Image 22: {\displaystyle X=\mathbb {R} ^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/16344851ca00c2c8c6c80f658d1a180eb94abee9) is the ![Image 23: {\displaystyle n}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b)-dimensional Euclidean space, and if ![Image 24: {\displaystyle \gamma :[a,b]\to \mathbb {R} ^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/cac70dec799b73a718bdc3431587a65f829bf03b) is an injective and continuously differentiable function, then the length of ![Image 25: {\displaystyle \gamma }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a223c880b0ce3da8f64ee33c4f0010beee400b1a) is defined as the quantity

![Image 26: {\displaystyle \operatorname {Length} (\gamma )~{\stackrel {\text{def}}{=}}~\int _{a}^{b}|\gamma \,'(t)|~\mathrm {d} {t}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f3499b6e95b4d901d9cda82ae684c3a527ae244c)
The length of a curve is independent of the [parametrization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametrization_(geometry) "Parametrization (geometry)")![Image 27: {\displaystyle \gamma }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a223c880b0ce3da8f64ee33c4f0010beee400b1a).

In particular, the length ![Image 28: {\displaystyle s}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/01d131dfd7673938b947072a13a9744fe997e632) of the [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_of_a_function "Graph of a function") of a continuously differentiable function ![Image 29: {\displaystyle y=f(x)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2311a6a75c54b0ea085a381ba472c31d59321514) defined on a closed interval ![Image 30: {\displaystyle [a,b]}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9c4b788fc5c637e26ee98b45f89a5c08c85f7935) is

### Differential geometry

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Curve&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Differential geometry")]

While the first examples of curves that are met are mostly plane curves (that is, in everyday words, _curved lines_ in _two-dimensional space_), there are obvious examples such as the [helix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helix "Helix") which exist naturally in three dimensions. The needs of geometry, and also for example [classical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics "Classical mechanics") are to have a notion of curve in space of any number of dimensions. In [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity"), a [world line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_line "World line") is a curve in [spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime "Spacetime").

If ![Image 48: {\displaystyle X}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab) is a [differentiable manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_manifold "Differentiable manifold"), then we can define the notion of _differentiable curve_ in ![Image 49: {\displaystyle X}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab). This general idea is enough to cover many of the applications of curves in mathematics. From a local point of view one can take ![Image 50: {\displaystyle X}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab) to be Euclidean space. On the other hand, it is useful to be more general, in that (for example) it is possible to define the [tangent vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry_of_curves "Differential geometry of curves") to ![Image 51: {\displaystyle X}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab) by means of this notion of curve.

If ![Image 52: {\displaystyle X}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab) is a [smooth manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_manifold "Smooth manifold"), a _smooth curve_ in ![Image 53: {\displaystyle X}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab) is a [smooth map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_map "Smooth map")

![Image 54: {\displaystyle \gamma \colon I\rightarrow X}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3449e529dba68d61e3a773eb4b728943a96064fb).

If ![Image 62: {\displaystyle X}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab) is an [analytic manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold "Manifold") (i.e. infinitely differentiable and charts are expressible as [power series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_series "Power series")), and ![Image 63: {\displaystyle \gamma }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a223c880b0ce3da8f64ee33c4f0010beee400b1a) is an analytic map, then ![Image 64: {\displaystyle \gamma }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a223c880b0ce3da8f64ee33c4f0010beee400b1a) is said to be an _analytic curve_.

Algebraic curves are the curves considered in [algebraic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry "Algebraic geometry"). A plane algebraic curve is the [set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics) "Set (mathematics)") of the points of coordinates _x_, _y_ such that _f_(_x_, _y_) = 0, where _f_ is a polynomial in two variables defined over some field _F_. One says that the curve is _defined over_ _F_. Algebraic geometry normally considers not only points with coordinates in _F_ but all the points with coordinates in an [algebraically closed field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraically_closed_field "Algebraically closed field")_K_.

If _C_ is a curve defined by a polynomial _f_ with coefficients in _F_, the curve is said to be defined over _F_.

In the case of a curve defined over the [real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number"), one normally considers points with [complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number "Complex number") coordinates. In this case, a point with real coordinates is a _real point_, and the set of all real points is the _real part_ of the curve. It is therefore only the real part of an algebraic curve that can be a topological curve (this is not always the case, as the real part of an algebraic curve may be disconnected and contain isolated points). The whole curve, that is the set of its complex point is, from the topological point of view a surface. In particular, the nonsingular complex projective algebraic curves are called [Riemann surfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_surface "Riemann surface").

The points of a curve _C_ with coordinates in a field _G_ are said to be rational over _G_ and can be denoted _C_(_G_). When _G_ is the field of the [rational numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_number "Rational number"), one simply talks of _rational points_. For example, [Fermat's Last Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_Last_Theorem "Fermat's Last Theorem") may be restated as: _For_ _n_> 2, _every rational point of the [Fermat curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat\_curve "Fermat curve") of degree n has a zero coordinate_.

Algebraic curves can also be space curves, or curves in a space of higher dimension, say _n_. They are defined as [algebraic varieties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_varieties "Algebraic varieties") of [dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension_of_an_algebraic_variety "Dimension of an algebraic variety") one. They may be obtained as the common solutions of at least _n_–1 polynomial equations in _n_ variables. If _n_–1 polynomials are sufficient to define a curve in a space of dimension _n_, the curve is said to be a [complete intersection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_intersection "Complete intersection"). By eliminating variables (by any tool of [elimination theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elimination_theory "Elimination theory")), an algebraic curve may be projected onto a [plane algebraic curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_algebraic_curve "Plane algebraic curve"), which however may introduce new singularities such as [cusps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cusp_(singularity) "Cusp (singularity)") or [double points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_point "Double point").

A plane curve may also be completed to a curve in the [projective plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_plane "Projective plane"): if a curve is defined by a polynomial _f_ of total degree _d_, then _w_ _d_ _f_(_u_/_w_, _v_/_w_) simplifies to a [homogeneous polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_polynomial "Homogeneous polynomial")_g_(_u_, _v_, _w_) of degree _d_. The values of _u_, _v_, _w_ such that _g_(_u_, _v_, _w_) = 0 are the homogeneous coordinates of the points of the completion of the curve in the projective plane and the points of the initial curve are those such that _w_ is not zero. An example is the Fermat curve _u_ _n_ + _v_ _n_ = _w_ _n_, which has an affine form _x_ _n_ + _y_ _n_ = 1. A similar process of homogenization may be defined for curves in higher dimensional spaces.

Except for [lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_(geometry) "Line (geometry)"), the simplest examples of algebraic curves are the [conics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conic_section "Conic section"), which are nonsingular curves of degree two and [genus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus_(mathematics) "Genus (mathematics)") zero. [Elliptic curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve "Elliptic curve"), which are nonsingular curves of genus one, are studied in [number theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory "Number theory"), and have important applications to [cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography "Cryptography").
