Anti-Austrian sentiment (also known as Austrophobia ) refers to hostile sentiment toward the nation of Austria and/or Austrians .

The 19th century British Prime Minister , William Ewart Gladstone , famously said in 1880 that "in the whole world it was impossible to place a finger on a spot and say, 'Here Austria did good'." In the following years, Gladstonian Liberals in Britain frequently repeated this saying.
