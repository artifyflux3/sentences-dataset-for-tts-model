He defeated Craig Steadman 6–1, six-time world champion Steve Davis 6–5 (after being 1–4 down), [ 13 ] Alan McManus 6–3 and Michael Holt 6–4 to reach the venue stage for the first time.

[ 21 ] His match with Allen finished at 11 pm local time, with Advani back in last 16 action at 10 am the next morning to play Stuart Bingham . The match went to a deciding frame and when Bingham broke down on a break of 30, Advani stepped in to compose a match winning 86. Advani played compatriot Aditya Mehta in the quarter-finals in an iconic match in Indian snooker as the winner would be the country's first ranking event semi-finalist.

[ 22 ] The match was heavily focused on safety and it was Mehta who advanced with a 4–3 win.

[ 23 ] His best run in a ranking event during the rest of the season was at the World Open , where he narrowly beat Xiao Guodong 5–4 to set up a last 32 meeting with Ding Junhui .
