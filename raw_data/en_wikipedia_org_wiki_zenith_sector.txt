They are used for precision measurement of star positions, to simplify telescope construction, or both.

A classic zenith telescope, also known as a zenith sector employs a strong altazimuth mount , fitted with levelling screws. Extremely sensitive levels are attached and the telescope has an eyepiece fitted with a micrometer .

[ 1 ] They are used for the measurement of small differences of zenith distance, and used in the determination of astronomic latitude .

Other types of zenith telescopes include the Monument to the Great Fire of London , which includes a central shaft meant for use as a zenith telescope. High-precision (and fixed building) zenith telescopes were also used until the early 1980s to track Earth's north pole position e.g.

Earth's rotation axis position ( polar motion ). Since then radio astronomical quasar measurements ( VLBI ) have also measured Earth's rotation axis several orders of magnitude more accurately than optical tracking.

The NASA Orbital Debris Observatory with an aperture of 3 m and the Large Zenith Telescope with an aperture of 6 m are constructed as zenith telescopes, as the use of liquid mirrors limits them to pointing straight up.
