It is published by ISO/IEC JTC 1 / SC 25 /WG 3 of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). It covers both balanced copper cabling and optical fibre cabling.

The standard was designed for use within commercial premises that may consist of either a single building or of multiple buildings on a campus. It was optimized for premises that span up to 3 km, up to 1 km 2 office space, with between 50 and 50,000 persons, but can also be applied for installations outside this range.

A major revision was released in November 2017, unifying requirements for commercial, home and industrial networks.

Class F: Up to 600 MHz using Category 7 cable and connectors Class F A : Up to 1 GHz (1000 MHz) using Category 7 A cable and connectors (Amendments 1 and 2 to ISO/IEC 11801, 2nd Ed.) Class BCT-B: Up to 1 GHz (1000 MHz) using with coaxial cabling for BCT applications. (ISO/IEC 11801-1, Edition 1.0 2017-11) Class I: Up to 2 GHz (2000 MHz) using Category 8.1 cable and connectors (ISO/IEC 11801-1, Edition 1.0 2017-11) Class II: Up to 2 GHz (2000 MHz) using Category 8.2 cable and connectors (ISO/IEC 11801-1, Edition 1.0 2017-11) The standard link impedance is 100 Ω. (The older 1995 version of the standard also permitted 120 Ω and 150 Ω in Classes A−C, but this was removed from the 2002 edition.) The standard defines several classes of optical fiber interconnect: OM1*: Multimode, 62.5 μm core; minimum modal bandwidth of 200 MHz·km at 850 nm OM2*: Multimode, 50 μm core; minimum modal bandwidth of 500 MHz·km at 850 nm OM3: Multimode, 50 μm core; minimum modal bandwidth of 2000 MHz·km at 850 nm OM4: Multimode, 50 μm core; minimum modal bandwidth of 4700 MHz·km at 850 nm OM5: Multimode, 50 μm core; minimum modal bandwidth of 4700 MHz·km at 850 nm and 2470 MHz·km at 953 nm OS1*: Single-mode, maximum attenuation 1 dB/km at 1310 and 1550 nm OS1a: Single-mode, maximum attenuation 1 dB/km at 1310, 1383, and 1550 nm OS2: Single-mode, maximum attenuation 0.4 dB/km at 1310, 1383, and 1550 nm *Grandfathered OM5 [ edit ] This section needs additional citations for verification .

Find sources: "ISO/IEC 11801" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( January 2019 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) OM5 fiber is designed for wideband applications using SWDM multiplexing of 4–16 carriers (40G=4λ×10G, 100G=4λ×25G, 400G=4×4λ×25G) in the 850–953 nm range.

Category 7 [ edit ] "Category 7" redirects here. For the heavy metal supergroup, see Category 7 (band) . For the miniseries and B movie, see Category 7: The End of the World .

Category 7 S/FTP cable Class F channel and Category 7 cable are backward compatible with Class D/Category 5e and Class E/Category 6. Class F features even stricter specifications for crosstalk and system noise than Class E. To achieve this, shielding was added for individual wire pairs and the cable as a whole. Unshielded cables rely on the quality of the twists to protect from EMI. This involves a tight twist and carefully controlled design. Cables with individual shielding per pair such as Category 7 rely mostly on the shield and therefore have pairs with longer twists.

[ 1 ] The Category 7 cable standard was ratified in 2002, and primarily introduced to support 10 gigabit Ethernet over 100 m of copper cabling.

[ 2 ] Like the earlier standards, it contains four twisted copper wire pairs rated for transmission frequencies of up to 600 MHz.

[ 3 ] However, in 2006, Category 6 A was ratified for Ethernet to allow 10 Gbit/s while still using the conventional 8P8C connector. Care is required to avoid signal degradation by mixing cable and connectors not designed for that use, however similar. Most manufacturers of active equipment and network cards have chosen to support the 8P8C for their 10 gigabit Ethernet products on copper and not GG45 , ARJ45 , or TERA connectors as Class F would have originally called for.

[ 4 ] Therefore, the Category 6 specification was revised to Category 6 A to permit this use; products therefore require a Class E A channel (ie, Cat 6 A ).

[ citation needed ] As of 2019, [update] some equipment has been introduced which has connectors supporting the Class F (Category 7) channel.

[ citation needed ] Note, however, that Category 7 is not recognized by the TIA / EIA .

[ citation needed ] Category 7 A [ edit ] This section needs additional citations for verification .

Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources in this section. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed.

Find sources: "ISO/IEC 11801" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( January 2019 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Class F A (Class F Augmented) channels and Category 7 A cables, introduced by ISO 11801 Edition 2 Amendment 2 (2010), are defined at frequencies up to 1000 MHz.

[ citation needed ] The intent of the Class F A was to possibly support the future 40 gigabit Ethernet: 40GBASE-T . Simulation results have shown that 40 gigabit Ethernet may be possible at 50 meters and 100 gigabit Ethernet at 15 meters.

[ citation needed ] In 2007, researchers at Pennsylvania State University predicted that either 32 nm or 22 nm circuits would allow for 100 gigabit Ethernet at 100 meters.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] However, in 2016, the IEEE 802.3bq working group ratified the amendment 3 which defines 25GBASE-T and 40GBASE-T on Category 8 cabling specified to 2000 MHz. The Class F A therefore does not support 40G Ethernet.

As of 2017, [update] [ needs update ] there is no equipment that has connectors supporting the Class F A (Category 7 A ) channel.

Category 7 A is not recognized in TIA/EIA.

Category 8 [ edit ] Parts of this article (those related to this section) need to be updated .

Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information.

( June 2019 ) Cross-section of a Category 8 F/FTP cable Category 8 was ratified by the TR43 working group under ANSI/TIA 568-C.2-1. It is defined up to 2000 MHz and only for distances up to 30 m or 36 m, depending on the patch cords used.

ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 25 /WG 3 developed the equivalent standard ISO/IEC 11801-1:2017/COR 1:2018, with two options: [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] Class I channel ( Category 8.1 cable): minimum cable design U/FTP or F/UTP, fully backward compatible and interoperable with Class E A (Category 6 A ) using 8P8C connectors ; Class II channel ( Category 8.2 cable): F/FTP or S/FTP minimum, interoperable with Class F A (Category 7 A ) using TERA or GG45 .

Abbreviations for twisted pairs [ edit ] Main article: Twisted pair § Cable shielding Annex E, Acronyms for balanced cables , provides a system to specify the exact construction for both unshielded and shielded balanced twisted pair cables. It uses three letters—U for unshielded, S for braided shielding, and F for foil shielding—to form a two-part abbreviation in the form of xx/xTP, where the first part specifies the type of overall cable shielding, and the second part specifies shielding for individual cable elements.

Common cable types include U/UTP (unshielded cable); U/FTP (individual pair shielding without the overall screen); F/UTP, S/UTP, or SF/UTP (overall screen without individual shielding); and F/FTP, S/FTP, or SF/FTP (overall screen with individual foil shielding).

2017 edition [ edit ] In November 2017, a new edition was released by ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 25 "Interconnection of information technology equipment" subcommittee. It is a major revision of the standard which has unified several prior standards for commercial, home, and industrial networks, as well as data centers, and defines requirements for generic cabling and distributed building networks.

The new series of standards replaces the former 11801 standard and includes six parts: [ 7 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] ISO/IEC Standard Title Replaces Description ISO/IEC 11801-1 Part 1: General requirements ISO/IEC 11801 Generic cabling requirements for twisted-pair and optical fiber cables ISO/IEC 11801-2 Part 2: Office premises ISO/IEC 11801 Cabling for commercial (enterprise) buildings ISO/IEC 11801-3 Part 3: Industrial premises ISO/IEC 24702 Cabling for industrial buildings, with applications including automation, process control , and monitoring ISO/IEC 11801-4 Part 4: Single-tenant homes ISO/IEC 15018 Cabling for residential buildings, including 1200 MHz links for CATV / SATV applications ISO/IEC 11801-5 Part 5: Data centers ISO/IEC 24764 Cabling for high-performance networks used by data centers ISO/IEC 11801-6 Part 6: Distributed building services — Cabling for distributed wireless networks for building automation and IOT devices Versions [ edit ] ISO/IEC 11801:1995 (Ed. 1) ISO/IEC 11801:2000 (Ed. 1.1) – Edition 1, Amendment 1 ISO/IEC 11801:2002 (Ed. 2) ISO/IEC 11801:2008 (Ed. 2.1) – Edition 2, Amendment 1 ISO/IEC 11801:2010 (Ed. 2.2) – Edition 2, Amendment 2 ISO/IEC 11801-1:2017, -1:2017/Cor 1:2018, -2:2017, -3:2017, -3:2017/Amd 1:2021, -3:2017/Cor 1:2018, -4:2017, -4:2017/Cor 1:2018, -5:2017, -5:2017/Cor 1:2018, -6:2017, -6:2017/Cor 1:2018 (As of September 2023, [ref] this set is current.)
