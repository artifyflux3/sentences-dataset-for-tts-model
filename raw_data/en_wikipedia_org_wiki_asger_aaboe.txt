In his studies of Babylonian astronomy, he went beyond analyses in terms of modern mathematics to seek to understand how the Babylonians conceived their computational schemes.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Aaboe studied mathematics and astronomy at the University of Copenhagen , and in 1957 obtained a PhD in the History of Science from Brown University , where he studied under Otto Neugebauer , writing a dissertation "On Babylonian Planetary Theories". In 1961, he joined the Department of the History of Science and Medicine at Yale University , serving as chair from 1968 to 1971, and continuing an active career there until retiring in 1992. At Yale, his doctoral students included Alice Slotsky and Noel Swerdlow .

[ 4 ] He was elected to the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters in 1975, served as president of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences from 1970 to 1980, and was a member of many other scholarly societies.

In 1987, a festschrift was published in honor of Asger Aaboe's 65th birthday.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] Aaboe married Joan Armstrong on 14 July 1950. The marriage produced four children: Kirsten Aaboe, Erik Harris Aaboe, Anne Aaboe, Niels Peter Aaboe.
