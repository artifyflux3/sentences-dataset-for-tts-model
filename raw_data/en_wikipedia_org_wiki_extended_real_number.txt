For the extension by a single point at infinity, see Projectively extended real line .

Extended real numbers (top) vs projectively extended real numbers (bottom) In mathematics , the extended real number system [ a ] is obtained from the real number system R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } by adding two elements denoted + ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle +\infty } and − − ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle -\infty } [ b ] that are respectively greater and lower than every real number. This allows for treating the potential infinities of infinitely increasing sequences and infinitely decreasing series as actual infinities . For example, the infinite sequence ( 1 , 2 , … … ) {\displaystyle (1,2,\ldots )} of the natural numbers increases infinitively and has no upper bound in the real number system (a potential infinity); in the extended real number line, the sequence has + ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle +\infty } as its least upper bound and as its limit (an actual infinity). In calculus and mathematical analysis , the use of + ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle +\infty } and − − ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle -\infty } as actual limits extends significantly the possible computations.

[ 1 ] It is the Dedekind–MacNeille completion of the real numbers.

The extended real number system is denoted R ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle {\overline {\mathbb {R} }}} , [ − − ∞ ∞ , + ∞ ∞ ] {\displaystyle [-\infty ,+\infty ]} , or R ∪ ∪ { − − ∞ ∞ , + ∞ ∞ } {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} \cup \left\{-\infty ,+\infty \right\}} .

[ 2 ] When the meaning is clear from context, the symbol + ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle +\infty } is often written simply as ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \infty } .

[ 2 ] There is also a distinct projectively extended real line where + ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle +\infty } and − − ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle -\infty } are not distinguished, i.e., there is a single actual infinity for both infinitely increasing sequences and infinitely decreasing sequences that is denoted as just ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \infty } or as ± ± ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \pm \infty } .

Motivation [ edit ] Limits [ edit ] The extended number line is often useful to describe the behavior of a function f {\displaystyle f} when either the argument x {\displaystyle x} or the function value f {\displaystyle f} gets "infinitely large" in some sense. For example, consider the function f {\displaystyle f} defined by f ( x ) = 1 x 2 {\displaystyle f(x)={\frac {1}{x^{2}}}} .

The graph of this function has a horizontal asymptote at y = 0 {\displaystyle y=0} . Geometrically, when moving increasingly farther to the right along the x {\displaystyle x} -axis, the value of 1 / x 2 {\textstyle {1}/{x^{2}}} approaches 0. This limiting behavior is similar to the limit of a function lim x → → x 0 f ( x ) {\textstyle \lim _{x\to x_{0}}f(x)} in which the real number x {\displaystyle x} approaches x 0 , {\displaystyle x_{0},} except that there is no real number that x {\displaystyle x} approaches when x {\displaystyle x} increases infinitely. Adjoining the elements + ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle +\infty } and − − ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle -\infty } to R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } enables a definition of "limits at infinity" which is very similar to the usual definition of limits, except that | x − − x 0 | < ε ε {\displaystyle |x-x_{0}|<\varepsilon } is replaced by x > N {\displaystyle x>N} (for + ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle +\infty } ) or x < − − N {\displaystyle x<-N} (for − − ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle -\infty } ). This allows proving and writing lim x → → + ∞ ∞ 1 x 2 = 0 , lim x → → − − ∞ ∞ 1 x 2 = 0 , lim x → → 0 1 x 2 = + ∞ ∞ .

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\lim _{x\to +\infty }{\frac {1}{x^{2}}}&=0,\\\lim _{x\to -\infty }{\frac {1}{x^{2}}}&=0,\\\lim _{x\to 0}{\frac {1}{x^{2}}}&=+\infty .\end{aligned}}} Measure and integration [ edit ] This section may be confusing or unclear to readers . In particular, darn the original message I can understand this page just fine.

Please help clarify the section . There might be a discussion about this on the talk page .

( July 2025 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) In measure theory , it is often useful to allow sets that have infinite measure and integrals whose value may be infinite.

Such measures arise naturally out of calculus. For example, in assigning a measure to R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } that agrees with the usual length of intervals , this measure must be larger than any finite real number. Also, when considering improper integrals , such as ∫ ∫ 1 ∞ ∞ d x x {\displaystyle \int _{1}^{\infty }{\frac {dx}{x}}} the value "infinity" arises. Finally, it is often useful to consider the limit of a sequence of functions, such as f n ( x ) = { 2 n ( 1 − − n x ) , if 0 ≤ ≤ x ≤ ≤ 1 n 0 , if 1 n < x ≤ ≤ 1 {\displaystyle f_{n}(x)={\begin{cases}2n(1-nx),&{\mbox{if }}0\leq x\leq {\frac {1}{n}}\\0,&{\mbox{if }}{\frac {1}{n}}<x\leq 1\end{cases}}} .

Without allowing functions to take on infinite values, such essential results as the monotone convergence theorem and the dominated convergence theorem would not make sense.

Order and topological properties [ edit ] The extended real number system R ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle {\overline {\mathbb {R} }}} , defined as [ − − ∞ ∞ , + ∞ ∞ ] {\displaystyle [-\infty ,+\infty ]} or R ∪ ∪ { − − ∞ ∞ , + ∞ ∞ } {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} \cup \left\{-\infty ,+\infty \right\}} , can be turned into a totally ordered set by defining − − ∞ ∞ ≤ ≤ a ≤ ≤ + ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle -\infty \leq a\leq +\infty } for all a ∈ ∈ R ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle a\in {\overline {\mathbb {R} }}} . With this order topology , R ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle {\overline {\mathbb {R} }}} has the desirable property of compactness : Every subset of R ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle {\overline {\mathbb {R} }}} has a supremum and an infimum [ 2 ] (the infimum of the empty set is + ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle +\infty } , and its supremum is − − ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle -\infty } ). Moreover, with this topology , R ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle {\overline {\mathbb {R} }}} is homeomorphic to the unit interval [ 0 , 1 ] {\displaystyle [0,1]} . Thus the topology is metrizable , corresponding (for a given homeomorphism) to the ordinary metric on this interval. There is no metric, however, that is an extension of the ordinary metric on R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } .

In this topology, a set U {\displaystyle U} is a neighborhood of + ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle +\infty } if and only if it contains a set { x : x > a } {\displaystyle \{x:x>a\}} for some real number a {\displaystyle a} . The notion of the neighborhood of − − ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle -\infty } can be defined similarly. Using this characterization of extended-real neighborhoods, limits with x {\displaystyle x} tending to + ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle +\infty } or − − ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle -\infty } , and limits "equal" to + ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle +\infty } and − − ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle -\infty } , reduce to the general topological definition of limits—instead of having a special definition in the real number system.

Arithmetic operations [ edit ] The arithmetic operations of R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } can be partially extended to R ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle {\overline {\mathbb {R} }}} as follows: [ 3 ] a ± ± ∞ ∞ = ± ± ∞ ∞ + a = ± ± ∞ ∞ , a ≠ ≠ ∓ ∓ ∞ ∞ a ⋅ ⋅ ( ± ± ∞ ∞ ) = ± ± ∞ ∞ ⋅ ⋅ a = ± ± ∞ ∞ , a ∈ ∈ ( 0 , + ∞ ∞ ] a ⋅ ⋅ ( ± ± ∞ ∞ ) = ± ± ∞ ∞ ⋅ ⋅ a = ∓ ∓ ∞ ∞ , a ∈ ∈ [ − − ∞ ∞ , 0 ) a ± ± ∞ ∞ = 0 , a ∈ ∈ R ± ± ∞ ∞ a = ± ± ∞ ∞ , a ∈ ∈ ( 0 , + ∞ ∞ ) ± ± ∞ ∞ a = ∓ ∓ ∞ ∞ , a ∈ ∈ ( − − ∞ ∞ , 0 ) {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}a\pm \infty =\pm \infty +a&=\pm \infty ,&a&\neq \mp \infty \\a\cdot (\pm \infty )=\pm \infty \cdot a&=\pm \infty ,&a&\in (0,+\infty ]\\a\cdot (\pm \infty )=\pm \infty \cdot a&=\mp \infty ,&a&\in [-\infty ,0)\\{\frac {a}{\pm \infty }}&=0,&a&\in \mathbb {R} \\{\frac {\pm \infty }{a}}&=\pm \infty ,&a&\in (0,+\infty )\\{\frac {\pm \infty }{a}}&=\mp \infty ,&a&\in (-\infty ,0)\end{aligned}}} For exponentiation, see Exponentiation § Limits of powers . Here, a + ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle a+\infty } means both a + ( + ∞ ∞ ) {\displaystyle a+(+\infty )} and a − − ( − − ∞ ∞ ) {\displaystyle a-(-\infty )} , while a − − ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle a-\infty } means both a − − ( + ∞ ∞ ) {\displaystyle a-(+\infty )} and a + ( − − ∞ ∞ ) {\displaystyle a+(-\infty )} .

The expressions ∞ ∞ − − ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \infty -\infty } , 0 × × ( ± ± ∞ ∞ ) {\displaystyle 0\times (\pm \infty )} , and ± ± ∞ ∞ / ± ± ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \pm \infty /\pm \infty } (called indeterminate forms ) are usually left undefined . These rules are modeled on the laws for infinite limits . However, in the context of probability or measure theory, 0 × × ± ± ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle 0\times \pm \infty } is often defined as 0.

[ 4 ] When dealing with both positive and negative extended real numbers, the expression 1 / 0 {\displaystyle 1/0} is usually left undefined, because, although it is true that for every real nonzero sequence f {\displaystyle f} that converges to 0, the reciprocal sequence 1 / f {\displaystyle 1/f} is eventually contained in every neighborhood of { ∞ ∞ , − − ∞ ∞ } {\displaystyle \{\infty ,-\infty \}} , it is not true that the sequence 1 / f {\displaystyle 1/f} must itself converge to either − − ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle -\infty } or ∞ ∞ .

{\displaystyle \infty .} Said another way, if a continuous function f {\displaystyle f} achieves a zero at a certain value x 0 , {\displaystyle x_{0},} then it need not be the case that 1 / f {\displaystyle 1/f} tends to either − − ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle -\infty } or ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \infty } in the limit as x {\displaystyle x} tends to x 0 {\displaystyle x_{0}} . This is the case for the limits of the identity function f ( x ) = x {\displaystyle f(x)=x} when x {\displaystyle x} tends to 0, and of f ( x ) = x 2 sin ⁡ ⁡ ( 1 / x ) {\displaystyle f(x)=x^{2}\sin \left(1/x\right)} (for the latter function, neither − − ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle -\infty } nor ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \infty } is a limit of 1 / f ( x ) {\displaystyle 1/f(x)} , even if only positive values of x {\displaystyle x} are considered).

However, in contexts where only non-negative values are considered, it is often convenient to define 1 / 0 = + ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle 1/0=+\infty } . For example, when working with power series , the radius of convergence of a power series with coefficients a n {\displaystyle a_{n}} is often defined as the reciprocal of the limit-supremum of the sequence ( | a n | 1 / n ) {\displaystyle \left(|a_{n}|^{1/n}\right)} . Thus, if one allows 1 / 0 {\displaystyle 1/0} to take the value + ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle +\infty } , then one can use this formula regardless of whether the limit-supremum is 0 or not.

Algebraic properties [ edit ] With the arithmetic operations defined above, R ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle {\overline {\mathbb {R} }}} is not even a semigroup , let alone a group , a ring or a field as in the case of R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } . However, it has several convenient properties: a + ( b + c ) {\displaystyle a+(b+c)} and ( a + b ) + c {\displaystyle (a+b)+c} are either equal or both undefined.

a + b {\displaystyle a+b} and b + a {\displaystyle b+a} are either equal or both undefined.

a ⋅ ⋅ ( b ⋅ ⋅ c ) {\displaystyle a\cdot (b\cdot c)} and ( a ⋅ ⋅ b ) ⋅ ⋅ c {\displaystyle (a\cdot b)\cdot c} are either equal or both undefined.

a ⋅ ⋅ b {\displaystyle a\cdot b} and b ⋅ ⋅ a {\displaystyle b\cdot a} are either equal or both undefined a ⋅ ⋅ ( b + c ) {\displaystyle a\cdot (b+c)} and ( a ⋅ ⋅ b ) + ( a ⋅ ⋅ c ) {\displaystyle (a\cdot b)+(a\cdot c)} are equal if both are defined.

If a ≤ ≤ b {\displaystyle a\leq b} and if both a + c {\displaystyle a+c} and b + c {\displaystyle b+c} are defined, then a + c ≤ ≤ b + c {\displaystyle a+c\leq b+c} .

If a ≤ ≤ b {\displaystyle a\leq b} and c > 0 {\displaystyle c>0} and if both a ⋅ ⋅ c {\displaystyle a\cdot c} and b ⋅ ⋅ c {\displaystyle b\cdot c} are defined, then a ⋅ ⋅ c ≤ ≤ b ⋅ ⋅ c {\displaystyle a\cdot c\leq b\cdot c} .

In general, all laws of arithmetic are valid in R ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle {\overline {\mathbb {R} }}} as long as all occurring expressions are defined.

Miscellaneous [ edit ] Several functions can be continuously extended to R ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle {\overline {\mathbb {R} }}} by taking limits. For instance, one may define the extremal points of the following functions as: exp ⁡ ⁡ ( − − ∞ ∞ ) = 0 {\displaystyle \exp(-\infty )=0} , ln ⁡ ⁡ ( 0 ) = − − ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \ln(0)=-\infty } , tanh ⁡ ⁡ ( ± ± ∞ ∞ ) = ± ± 1 {\displaystyle \tanh(\pm \infty )=\pm 1} , arctan ⁡ ⁡ ( ± ± ∞ ∞ ) = ± ± π π 2 {\displaystyle \arctan(\pm \infty )=\pm {\frac {\pi }{2}}} .

Some singularities may additionally be removed. For example, the function 1 / x 2 {\displaystyle 1/x^{2}} can be continuously extended to R ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle {\overline {\mathbb {R} }}} (under some definitions of continuity), by setting the value to + ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle +\infty } for x = 0 {\displaystyle x=0} , and 0 for x = + ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle x=+\infty } and x = − − ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle x=-\infty } . On the other hand, the function 1 / x {\displaystyle 1/x} can not be continuously extended, because the function approaches − − ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle -\infty } as x {\displaystyle x} approaches 0 from below , and + ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle +\infty } as x {\displaystyle x} approaches 0 from above, i.e., the function not converging to the same value as its independent variable approaching to the same domain element from both the positive and negative value sides.

A similar but different real-line system, the projectively extended real line , does not distinguish between + ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle +\infty } and − − ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle -\infty } (i.e. infinity is unsigned).

[ 4 ] As a result, a function may have limit ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \infty } on the projectively extended real line, while in the extended real number system only the absolute value of the function has a limit, e.g. in the case of the function 1 / x {\displaystyle 1/x} at x = 0 {\displaystyle x=0} . On the other hand, on the projectively extended real line, lim x → → − − ∞ ∞ f ( x ) {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to -\infty }{f(x)}} and lim x → → + ∞ ∞ f ( x ) {\displaystyle \lim _{x\to +\infty }{f(x)}} correspond to only a limit from the right and one from the left, respectively, with the full limit only existing when the two are equal. Thus, the functions e x {\displaystyle e^{x}} and arctan ⁡ ⁡ ( x ) {\displaystyle \arctan(x)} cannot be made continuous at x = ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle x=\infty } on the projectively extended real line.
