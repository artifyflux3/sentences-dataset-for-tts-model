[ 4 ] Meredith Thring was one of the founders.

[ 5 ] The IFRF Membership Network unites some 1000 combustion researchers from 130 industrial companies and academic institutions worldwide, around a common interest in efficient and environmentally responsible industrial combustion , with a focus on flame studies.

History [ edit ] The IFRF can be traced to a proposal written in 1948 by Meredith Thring , head of the Physics Department in the newly formed British Iron and Steel Research Association (BISRA).

[ 6 ] Entitled Proposals for the Establishment of an International Research Project on Luminous Radiation , the document resulted in the formation of the International Flame Radiation Research Committee with representatives of the steel, fuel and appliance making industries in France, Holland and England - specifically the British Iron and Steel Research Association (BISRA), the Iron and Steel Research Association of France (IRSID) and the Royal Dutch Iron and Steel Company (KNHS).

[ 6 ] Publications [ edit ] The IFRF is the publisher of technical reports and regular publications: The Industrial Combustion Journal ( ISSN 2075-3071 ) since 1999, named IFRF Combustion Journal between Sept. 1999 and Aug. 2009 ( ISSN 1562-479X ), The Monday Night Mail - MNM - ( ISSN 1562-4781 ) since 1999, in 1998 a few numbers of the IFRF Newsletter were also published, The Combustion Handbook ( ISSN 1607-9116 ) since 2001.

Theses publications are freely available on-line.

Events [ edit ] The IFRF organises events to disseminate knowledge on combustion: conferences , technical meetings (called TOTeMs), common days with other technical or scientific associations and courses: Topic Oriented Technical Meetings (TOTeM) [ edit ] TOTeMs are organized since 1989, once or twice a year: List of TOTeM organized by the IFRF and national committees TOTeM n° Topic Year Location Country 51 Green hydrogen: advances in CFD simulations of industrial hydrogen flames (announced) [ 7 ] 2024 Calgary Canada 50 Decarbonising combustion in hard-to-abate sectors [ 8 ] 2023 Piacenza ( Politecnico di Milano ) Italy 49 Chemical energy carriers for long-term storage and long-distance transport of renewable energies [ 9 ] 2023 Mulhouse (LGRE) France 48 Hydrogen for decarbonisation [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] ( European Hydrogen Week 2022 side event [ 13 ] ) 2022 Jouy-en-Josas ( Air Liquide ) France 47 Additive manufacturing for combustion application [ 14 ] 2020 Paris ( Fivesgroup ) France 46 Waste-to-energy – Status and perspective of technologies [ 15 ] 2019 Pisa Italy 45 Gas turbines for future energy systems [ 16 ] 2018 Cardiff UK 44 Gaseous fuels for industry and power generation: challenges and opportunities [ 17 ] 2017 Essen ( GWI Gas- und Wärme-Institut ) Germany 43 Fired equipment safety and its associated instrumentation and control requirements [ 18 ] 2016 Sheffield UK 42 Industrial heating: furnaces, process heaters, kilns, design of safe and environmentally efficient thermal equipment [ 19 ] 2014 IJmuiden Netherlands 41 Optimisation of OXY/COAL/FGR systems – state of the art for scaling and modelling [ 20 ] 2014 Warsaw Poland 40 Gasification, a versatile technology converting biomass to produce synfuels, heat and power [ 21 ] 2015 Delft Netherlands 39 Oxy-coal Combustion [ 22 ] 2013 Pisa Italy 38 Tar & sulphur sampling and analysis [ 23 ] 2013 Copenhagen Denmark 37 Innovative and Advanced Coal Co-Firing Technologies [ 24 ] 2012 Warsaw Poland 36 Industrial Flares [ 25 ] 2010 Hawaii USA 35 Co-firing secondary fuels in power generation: from fuel characterization to full scale testing [ 26 ] 2010 Pisa Italy 34 Gas Turbine Research: Fuels, Combustion, Heat Transfer and Emissions [ 27 ] 2010 Cardiff University and the Gas Turbine Research Centre, Port Talbot UK 33 Challenges in Rotary Kiln Combustion Processes [ 28 ] 2009 Pisa Italy 32 Efficient solid fuel utilisation: How to overcome ash related restrictions [ 29 ] 2008 Freising Germany 31 Oxy-combustion technologies and applications [ 30 ] 2008 Pisa (Enel) Italy 30 Computational Fluid Dynamics – Simulation of Combustion Processes [ 31 ] 2007 Waikoloa (HI) USA 29 Characterisation of biofuels for co-combustion [ 32 ] 2006 Munich Germany 28 Mercury, trace metals and fine particulates – Issues and Solutions [ 33 ] 2008 Salt Lake City (UT) USA 27 Process heating in petroleum, petrochemical and chemical industries: Identifying trends and satisfying needs through leveraged external research [ 34 ] 2003 Birmingham UK 26 CO 2 control, capture, sequestration, storage and emissions trading [ 35 ] 2003 Birmingham UK 25 Quest for Zero Emission in Industrial Furnaces -State of the Art and Future Development of High Temperature Air Combustion [ 36 ] 2003 Stockholm Sweden 24 Challenges in the development of high efficiency combustion -

Locations [ edit ] From 1948 to 2005 the IFRF facilities were located in the CORUS R&D centre at IJmuiden (Netherlands).

[ 76 ] In 2015 a relocation of the IFRF headquarters process was initiated.
