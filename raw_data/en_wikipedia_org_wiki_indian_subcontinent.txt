It is now divided between Bangladesh , India , and Pakistan .

[ 1 ] Although the terms "Indian subcontinent" and "South Asia" are often also used interchangeably to denote a wider region which includes, in addition, Bhutan , the Maldives , Nepal and Sri Lanka , the "Indian subcontinent" is more of a geophysical term, whereas "South Asia" is more geopolitical .

[ 2 ] "South Asia" frequently also includes Afghanistan , which is not  considered part of the subcontinent even in extended usage.

[ 3 ] Name [ edit ] Historically, the region surrounding and southeast of the Indus River was often simply referred to as India in many historical sources. Even today, historians use this term to denote the entire Indian subcontinent when discussing history up until the era of the British Raj . Over time, however, "India" evolved to refer to a distinct political entity that eventually became a nation-state ( today the Republic of India ).

[ 4 ] According to the Oxford English Dictionary , the term subcontinent signifies a "subdivision of a continent which has a distinct geographical, political, or cultural identity" and also a "large land mass somewhat smaller than a continent".

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] Its use to signify the Indian subcontinent is evidenced from the early twentieth century when most of the territory was either part of the British Empire or allied with them.

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] It was a convenient term to refer to the region comprising both British India and the princely states .

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] The term has been particularly common in the British Empire and its successors, [ 11 ] while the term South Asia is the more common usage in Europe and North America as well as in most countries in South Asia itself sometimes.

[ 12 ] [ 13 ] According to historians Sugata Bose and Ayesha Jalal , the Indian subcontinent has come to be known as South Asia "in more recent and neutral parlance".

[ 14 ] Indologist Ronald B. Inden argues that the usage of the term South Asia is becoming more widespread since it clearly distinguishes the region from East Asia.

[ 15 ] While South Asia , a more accurate term that reflects the region's contemporary political demarcations, is replacing the Indian subcontinent , a term closely linked to the region's colonial heritage, as a cover term, the latter is still widely used in typological studies.

[ 16 ] [ 17 ] Since the Partition of India , citizens of Pakistan (which became independent of British India in 1947) and Bangladesh (which became independent of Pakistan in 1971) often perceive the use of the Indian subcontinent as offensive and suspicious because of the dominant placement of India in the term.

[ 18 ] As such it is being increasingly less used in those countries.

[ note 7 ] Meanwhile, many Indian analysts prefer to use the term because of the socio-cultural commonalities of the region.

[ 18 ] The region has also been called the "Asian subcontinent", [ 20 ] [ 21 ] the "South Asian subcontinent", [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] as well as "India" or " Greater India " in the classical and pre-modern sense.

[ 26 ] [ 3 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] The sport of cricket , introduced to the region by the  British, is notably popular in India , Pakistan , Sri Lanka , Nepal , Bangladesh and Afghanistan . Within a cricket context, these countries are sometimes referred to simply as the subcontinent e.g. " Australia's tour of the subcontinent".

[ 29 ] The term is also sometimes used adjectivally in cricket e.g. "subcontinental conditions".

[ 30 ] [ 31 ] Geology [ edit ] See also: Indian plate and Himalayas § Geology Cimmeria , having rifted from Gondwana shown drifting towards Eurasia, closing the Paleo-Tethys Ocean above, opening the Neo-Tethys Ocean below, and carrying parts of what is today the Tibetan Plateau The accretions of the Karakoram , the Kohistan-Ladakh island arc , and the Gangdese belt to Eurasia preceded the final India-Eurasia collision. The stars mark the syntaxis -causing obtrustions.

Before the Indian plate rifted from Gondwana and drifted northward toward Eurasia, two other landmasses, the Qiangtang terrane and Lhasa terrane , [ note 8 ] had accreted to Eurasia.

[ 33 ] The Qiantang and Lhasa terranes were part of the string of microcontinents Cimmeria , today constituting parts of Turkey , Iran , Pakistan (including the Karakoram [ 34 ] ), China , Myanmar , Thailand and Malaysia , which closed the Paleo-Tethys Ocean above them and opening the Neo-Tethys Ocean between them and Gondwana, eventually colliding with Eurasia, and creating the Cimmerian Orogeny .

[ 35 ] After the Lhasa terrane had adjoined Eurasia, an active continental margin opened along its southern flank, below which the Neo-Tethys oceanic plate had begun to subduct.

Magmatic activity along this flank produced the Gangdese batholith in what is today the Tibetan trans-Himalaya . Another subduction zone opened to the west, in the ocean basin above the Kohistan-Ladakh island arc . This island arc—formed by one oceanic plate subducting beneath another, its magma rising and creating continental crust—drifted north, closed its ocean basin and collided with Eurasia.

[ 36 ] Ladakh is today in the Indian-administered region of Kashmir and Kohistan in the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan, both on the Indian subcontinent.

The collision of India with Eurasia closed the Neo-Tethys Ocean.

[ 35 ] The suture zone (in this instance, the remnants of the Neo-Tethys subduction zone pinched between the two continental crusts), which marks India's welding to Eurasia, is called the Indus-Yarlung suture zone .

[ 35 ] It lies north of the Himalayas. The headwaters of the Indus River and the Yarlung Tsangpo (later in its course, the Brahmaputra ) flow along this suture zone.

[ 35 ] These two Eurasian rivers, whose courses were continually diverted by the rising Himalayas, define the western and eastern limits, respectively, of the Himalayan mountain range.

[ 35 ] See also [ edit ] Arabian Peninsula India (Herodotus) Iranian Plateau South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) Notes [ edit ] ^ Excluding: Andaman and Nicobar Islands , close to the Malay Archipelago .

Ladakh , Spiti , and other areas which lie to the north of the Greater Himalayan Mountain Range .

Significant portions of northeast India which lie on the Indo-Burman Ranges (spanning Manipur , Nagaland and Mizoram ) as well as the Tibetan Plateau (northern Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim ) ^ a b As island countries , Maldives and Sri Lanka are sometimes not considered parts of the subcontinent, as they lack geographic contiguity with the mainland. They are considered parts of the region in cultural geography or geology instead.

^ Excluding Upper Mustang and other areas which lie to the north of the Greater Himalayan Mountain Range .

^ Excluding: Significant landmasses from East Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (like Federally Administered Tribal Areas ) which are situated on the Iranian Plateau .

Parts of Northern Areas (like Baltistan ) which lie to the north of the Greater Himalayan Mountain Range (completely crammed towards the Pamir and minuscule fragments of the Hindu Kush northwards from the extreme border end near the Wakhan Corridor of Afghanistan).

^ Administered by the United Kingdom, claimed by Mauritius as the Chagos Archipelago .

^ Disputed territory with undetermined political status . Administration is split between China ( Aksai Chin and the Trans-Karakoram Tract ), India ( Jammu and Kashmir , and Ladakh ), and Pakistan ( Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan ). China claims a small portion of the territory, Pakistan claims the majority of the territory, and India claims the entire territory (see: UN mediation of the Kashmir dispute ).

^ For example, a history book intended for Pakistani B.A. students by K. Ali uses the term "Indo-Pakistan" instead.

The Tirich Boundary Zone is a complex assemblage of high grade metabasites and gneiss with small remnants of sub-continental peridotites, which separate East Hindu Kush from the Karakoram. Its emplacement has been related to the possible opening of a basin between the two blocks at the end of the Paleozoic, followed by its deformation during the collision of Karakoram with East Hindu Kush, dating to the end of Triassic or beginning of the Jurassic.
