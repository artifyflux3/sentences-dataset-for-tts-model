[ 1 ] His research interests comprise " micropaleontology , marine sedimentation, ocean productivity , carbon cycle , ocean history, climate history , and history of oceanography ." [ 2 ] Education and career [ edit ] Berger earned in 1961 his Vordiplom degree in geology at the University of Erlangen and in 1963 his master's degree in geology at the University of Colorado in Boulder. In 1968 he received his PhD in oceanography from the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). From 1968 to 1970 he did research at the UCSD's Scripps Institution of Oceanography, and in 1970/1971 he was an Assistant at the Geological Institute of the University of Kiel . In 1971 he became an assistant professor, in 1974 an associate professor, and then in 1981 a professor at the Scripps Institution, where he was in 1996/1997 the interim director. In 1997 Berger became the director of the California Space Institute in San Diego. In 1977 and in 1980 he was a visiting professor at the University of Kiel. In 1987 he did research at the University of Bremen .

His research was especially concerned with the ecology of planktonic foraminifera and the reconstruction of the climate and the marine environment of the Cenozoic .

The Berger–Parker index is named after Berger and Frances Lawrence Parker .

[ 3 ] Berger was a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science , the American Geophysical Union , and the Geological Society of America .
