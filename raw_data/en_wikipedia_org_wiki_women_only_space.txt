studies journals Women's suffrage organizations Categories Women's rights by country Feminists by nationality Feminism portal v t e A women-only space is an area where only women (and in some cases children) are allowed, thus providing a place where they do not have to interact with men . Historically and globally, many cultures had, and many still have, some form of female seclusion . These spaces refer to physical or digital environments created to serve the social, cultural, educational, health, and safety needs of women.

History of women-only spaces [ edit ] The emergence of first wave feminism in the 19th and early 20th centuries, especially the struggle for women’s suffrage and access to education and professions in English-speaking societies, led to the creation of various women-only spaces intended to support their autonomy , safety , and social participation.

One of the earliest examples was the “ Ladies' Ordinary ” a women-only dining space that began appearing in North American hotels and restaurants around the 1830s. At a time when it was considered socially improper for women to dine alone or without a male escort, these separate dining rooms provided women with greater freedom of movement in public settings.

[ 1 ] In 1903, British activists Emmeline Pankhurst and her daughter Christabel Pankhurst founded the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), a militant organization focused on securing voting rights for women. Membership in the WSPU was exclusively open to women, reflecting the founders' belief in autonomous political organization free from male influence.

[ 2 ] By the 1910s and 1920s, women-only lounges and rest rooms became more common in the United States, particularly in rural areas. These spaces were designed to accommodate women traveling into towns to shop or conduct business and often included areas to rest, nurse children, or socialize. The Ladies Rest Room in Lewisburg, Tennessee, is believed to be one of the last remaining free-standing examples in the state still in use.

[ 3 ] In 1929, Virginia Woolf published the influential essay A Room of One's Own , in which she argued that women needed literal and figurative private space along with financial independence to write and express themselves freely. Her work became foundational in feminist thought and offered a powerful justification for the creation of women-only spaces in intellectual and artistic spheres.

[ 4 ] While the early development of this article focused primarily on western context, gender specific spaces evolved across many region, including Africa, adapting to diverse cultural and political environments to meet women's need for Safety , Solidarity and Self-expression values Women-only spaces were also present in African-societies , often embedded within social, cultural, or economic systems. In parts of West Africa, women managed and operated markets that were traditionally considered female-only spaces, providing both economic independence and platforms for communal decision-making, hence, the emergence of women-only spaces is not limited to Western feminist movements. Across Africa, diverse traditions have long fostered female-centered environments that served social, economic, and political purposes In Ghana, women-led markets were historically governed by market queens , [ 5 ] who played key roles in local governance and commerce. Notably, Agnes Oforiwa Tagoe-Quarcoopome , a market queen in Accra, mobilized women to support Ghana's independence movement by organizing the Makola Women Association.

[ 6 ] Among the Igbo people of Nigeria, the Umuada , a collective of women born into a particular lineage, functioned as a powerful institution.

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] These women returned to their paternal homes to resolve communal disputes, advocate for justice, and lead ceremonial and social activities.

[ 9 ] In Sierra Leone and Liberia , the Sande society is a women’s initiation institution that provides girls with rites of passage into adulthood.

[ 10 ] These women-only spaces serve as centers for spiritual education, leadership training, and the transmission of cultural values [ 11 ] The society promotes women's solidarity and counters male-dominated structures such as the Poro society.

In South Africa , several women-only organizations emerged during the Apartheid era. The Black Sash , founded in 1955 by white women, operated as a resistance organization advocating for civil rights through silent vigils and legal aid.

[ 12 ] The Federation of South African Women (FEDSAW), established in 1954, brought together women across racial lines to challenge pass laws and demand gender equality.

[ 13 ] Informal domestic gatherings and church-based prayer groups also functioned as safe spaces for women, enabling emotional support, mutual aid, and political consciousness-raising away from patriarchal and state surveillance.

These examples illustrate how women-only spaces in Africa have long provided platforms for social power, cultural transmission, and collective action often well before the influence of Western feminist movements.

Purpose and background [ edit ] Women-only spaces are a form of sex segregation , often designed to provide physical safety , social support , or opportunities for empowerment .

[ 14 ] These spaces may include women-only public toilets , passenger cars on public transport or women's parking spaces , gyms , educational institutions , or cultural associations. They are sometimes referred to as " safe spaces ,” particularly when created to shield women from harassment , discrimination , or gender-based violence.

[ 15 ] Historically, women-only spaces have emerged in response to unequal access to Public and private domains. In Western contexts, Feminist movement of the 19th and 20th centuries advocated for the establishment of areas where women could gather, educate, and organize autonomously.

[ 16 ] In African-societies , women-only associations have deep cultural roots. Examples include Ghana’s market queen networks, [ 17 ] Nigeria’s Umuada Kinship group, [ 7 ] and Liberia and Sierra Leone’s Sande society a female initiation and leadership organization.

[ 18 ] These institutions have historically functioned as centers of communal decision-making, spiritual teaching, and female solidarity.

Women-only spaces also exist in Professional , Academic , and religious contexts. In some regions, women-only mosques, prayer rooms, [ 19 ] or religious schools are designed to ensure spiritual participation within gender-segregated faith systems. Similarly, women’s colleges example Seven Sisters (colleges) :, [ 20 ] career workshops, and STEM-focused mentorship programs provide support in male-dominated environments.

These spaces do not go without challenge.

[ 21 ] While many view such spaces as empowering and necessary, others have critiqued them for reinforcing binary gender norms or excluding trans and Non-binary gender individuals, example: Men's rights activists have launched lawsuits to gain access to female-only spaces, as for example Stopps v Just Ladies Fitness (Metrotown) Ltd , regarding a gym in Canada . The access of trans women , regardless of their legal gender , is also sometimes contentious, [ 22 ] both from an ethical and from a legal perspective. In some cases, questions have been raised about the value and legitimacy of particular spaces being reserved for women [ 23 ] These debates continue to shape contemporary policies, particularly in sports, healthcare, and education.

Examples of women-only spaces [ edit ] Across both the Western world and Africa , women-only spaces have developed historically and contemporarily to serve various social , professional , health , religious, educational, and recreational needs of women. These environments ranging from banks, schools, and health clinics to transportation services, shelters, and cultural events provide women with opportunities for empowerment , community building , safety, and leadership . While differing in form and tradition across regions, these spaces reflect broader global movements toward gender equality, autonomy, and the protection of women's rights. The following sections highlight key examples of women-only spaces in both Western and African contexts.

[ citation needed ] Businesses and services Women-only banks , such as the Kenya Women Microfinance Bank , [ 24 ] support female entrepreneurs in Africa by providing access to financial services. In the West, The Women's Building in San Francisco [ 25 ] serves as a multi-service community center for women, offering legal aid, healthcare services, and leadership training.

Transportation To promote women's safety in urban areas, Pink rickshaw services have been introduced in countries like South Africa, [ 26 ] as well as Egypt. In the West, certain subway programs and designated ride-sharing initiatives focus on safer transit options for women during late hours.

Clubs and Digital Platforms Women's clubs have historically provided spaces for networking and activism. The National Association of Colored Women's Clubs (NACWC) in the United States founded in 1896, remains a prominent example.

[ 27 ] In Africa, organizations like African women in business in Ethiopia offer platforms for female entrepreneurs.

[ 28 ] Platforms such as She Leads Africa [ 29 ] create virtual women-centered communities for career and business advancement.

Celebrations and Cultural Events Celebrations such as International Women's Day are common practices in both the West and Africa.

[ 30 ] Movements like Take Back the Night , [ 31 ] which originated in the West, advocate for women's safety. Afro-feminist events like the Nyansapo Festival in Paris reflect African women's activism on a global scale.

Education Girls’ schools and women's colleges have played important roles in education.

[ 32 ] [ 33 ] Examples include: Girls' schools in Sierra Leone and Spelman College [ 34 ] in the United States, a historically Women's colleges in the Southern United States . In conflict-affected areas such as Afghanistan and northern Nigeria, informal underground schools for girls have emerged to continue education under restrictive conditions.

Land and Shelter Women's shelters provide safe spaces for women fleeing violence.

Rosie's Place in Boston, [ 35 ] founded in 1974, is considered the first women-only shelter in the West. In Kenya, Umoja, village Kenya [ 36 ] was established as a refuge for women escaping domestic abuse and early forced marriages. Other examples include Nkosi's Haven in South Africa, providing holistic care for mothers and children affected by HIV/AIDS .

Health Care Specialized health services for women exist across both Africa and the West. In the West, Feminist health center such as those initiated by the Our Bodies, Ourselves# Boston Women's Health Book Collective , pioneered women's healthcare activism during the Second-wave feminism . In Africa, organizations like the Fistula Foundation [ 37 ] operate clinics focusing on maternal health. Centers like the Native American Women's Health Education Resource Center offer culturally specific services to Indigenous women in the West.

Religion Women's spaces in religious settings are common in both Africa and the West. In Nigeria and parts of North Africa, Women's mosques provide separate worship spaces.

[ 38 ] In Jewish and Muslim traditions globally, gender-separated prayer areas are widespread. Christian convents and nunneries continue to provide religious communities exclusively for women.

Sports Women's sports leagues and competitions are prominent in both Africa and the West. The African Women Cup of Nations [ 39 ] is the premier women's football tournament in Africa, while in the West, leagues such as the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) showcase professional women's sports.

Toilets and Changing Rooms In public spaces across both Africa and the West, toilet and changing rooms are commonly sex segregates to provide privacy and safety. Efforts have also emerged to create gender-inclusive facilities in line with evolving discussions around gender identity.

[ citation needed ] Menstruation Cultural attitudes toward menstruation vary widely. In parts of rural Africa, such as Malawi and Uganda , girls may practice menstrual seclusion. Activists in both Africa and the West advocate for menstrual equity, emphasizing the importance of access to menstrual products and education in schools.

[ citation needed ] Military, Policing, and Prisons Separate military units for women exist in several African countries, such as Nigeria and South Africa. Incarcerated women in both the West and African nations are typically housed in women-only facilities or wings within larger prison systems.

Women's police station , first pioneered in Latin America, have been adopted in African nations like Sierra Leone to address gender-based crime.

[ citation needed ] Across Africa and Western, such spaces have evolved to provide Empowerment , Protection , Community building , and profession.

opportunities.
