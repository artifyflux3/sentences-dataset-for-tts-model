It serves as the state's flagship public research institution and land-grant university of Rhode Island . The university is classified classified among "R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity".

[ 4 ] As of 2019, URI enrolled 14,653 undergraduate students, 1,982 graduate students, and 1,339 non-degree students, making it the largest university in the state.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] Its main campus is located in the village of Kingston in southern Rhode Island. Satellite campuses include the Rhode Island Nursing Education Center in Providence's Jewelry District , the Narragansett Bay Campus in Narragansett , and the W. Alton Jones Campus in West Greenwich , which closed in June of 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic .

[ 7 ] The university offers bachelor's degrees , master's degrees , and doctoral degrees in 80 undergraduate and 49 graduate areas of study through nine academic schools and colleges. Another college, University College for Academic Success, serves primarily as an advising college for all incoming undergraduates and follows them through their first two years of enrollment at URI.

History [ edit ] The University of Rhode Island was first chartered as the Rhode Island State Agricultural School, associated with the state agricultural experiment station , in 1888. The site of the school was originally the Oliver Watson Farm in Kingston, whose original farmhouse is now a small museum. In 1892, the school was reorganized as the Rhode Island College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts .

[ 8 ] That year, it extended courses of study from two years to four years; URI reckons 1892 as its founding date. The first class had only seventeen students, each completing their course of study in two years. In 1909, the school's name was again changed to Rhode Island State College as the school's programs were expanded beyond its original agricultural education mandate.

The college graduated its first African American student, Harvey Robert Turner, in 1914. Turner majored in civil engineering, competed on the college's football and track teams, and received a Bachelor of Science degree. He went on to teach at Prairie View A&M University , where he also served as treasurer.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] In 1951 the school was given its current title through an act of the General Assembly following the addition of the College of Arts and Sciences and the offering of doctoral degrees. The Board of Governors for Higher Education, appointed by the governor, became the governing body of the university in 1981 during the presidency of Frank Newman (1974–1983). The Board of Governors was replaced by the Rhode Island Board of Education in 2013, [ 11 ] and by a 17-member Board of Trustees in 2019.

In 2013 the faculty adopted an open-access policy to make its scholarship publicly accessible online.

[ 12 ] Presidents [ edit ] Main article: List of presidents of the University of Rhode Island Twelve individuals have served as president, and three others have served as acting president of the University of Rhode Island.

Marc B. Parlange is the current president, having served since August 2021.

[ 13 ] Main campus [ edit ] URI's main campus is located in northern South Kingstown , [ 14 ] and most of the university property is in the Kingston census-designated place .

[ 15 ] The campus is accessed via Rhode Island Route 138 from either the west ( Interstate 95 ) or east ( United States Route 1 ). The campus was mostly farmland when it was purchased by the state in 1888, and still includes the c. 1796 Oliver Watson Farmhouse. The early buildings of the campus are set around its main quadrangle, and were built out of locally quarried granite. The campus master plan was developed by the noted landscape architects Olmsted, Olmsted & Eliot in the 1890s. The central portion of the campus, where most of its pre-1950 buildings are located, [ 16 ] was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2017.

Main Campus Gallery [ edit ] East Hall (1909) [ 17 ] and Washburn Hall (1921) Lippitt Hall, named for Governor Charles W. Lippitt , was originally a drill hall and armory (1897) Green Hall, named for Theodore F. Green (1937) Robert L.

Kirk Center for Advanced Technology (1995) New URI Engineering Stairway to Excellence (2019) New URI Engineering Building (2021) Satellite Campuses [ edit ] W. Alton Jones Campus [ edit ] The W. Alton Jones Campus is one of three satellite campuses of the University of Rhode Island and is located in West Greenwich , Rhode Island .  At 2309-acres (9.34 km 2 ) it is the largest satellite campus of the University of Rhode Island and consists of an Environmental Education Center, a business conference center, a working farm and the Nettie Marie Jones Nature Preserve .

[ 18 ] [ 19 ] The land was donated to the University of Rhode Island by Nettie Marie Jones, widow of businessman W. Alton Jones .

[ 18 ] [ 20 ] The addition of the property tripled the size of the University's landholdings and gave it the unique position of possessing more land than any of the other New England state universities .

[ 21 ] The property is a part of the coastal forest and wildlife corridor that spans from Washington, D.C., to Maine.

[ 22 ] The property also is a link between the 2,200-acre (8.90 km 2 ) Tillinghast Pond Management Area in West Greenwich and the 14,000-acre (56.66 km 2 ) Arcadia Management Area in West Greenwich and three other towns.

[ 22 ] The campus closed in June, 2020 and an online petition urging former URI president Dr.

David M. Dooley and former governor Gina Raimondo to reopen the camp and education programs has collected more than 6,900 signatures.

[ 22 ] History [ edit ] In 1954 W. Alton Jones , president of CITGO , bought the property for hunting and fishing vacations.  He was a close friend of United States President Dwight D. Eisenhower , who visited the property four times for fishing, hunting and skeet shooting.

[ 19 ] [ 23 ] On March 1, 1962, W. Alton Jones passed away in a plane crash while on his way to Los Angeles to meet Eisenhower for a fishing trip.

[ 24 ] His widow, Nettie Marie Jones, donated the property to the University of Rhode Island and included everything that remained on the property, from the buildings, to the farm animals and equipment - was included in the gift.

[ 21 ] Environmental Education Center [ edit ] In 1965 a Youth Science Center (now called the Environmental Education Center or EEC) was constructed with much of the funding provided by the W. Alton Jones Foundation .

[ 21 ] Governor John Chafee celebrated the opening of the Environmental Education Center at a dedication ceremony with a speech. 50 years later, his son Governor Lincoln Chafee celebrated the 50th anniversary of the W. Alton Jones campus at a rededication ceremony also with a speech.

[ 20 ] [ 25 ] The Environmental Education Center hosted an average of 1900 campers each summer and 70 different school groups from the New England region during the academic school year.

[ 26 ] Whispering Pines Conference Center [ edit ] The Whispering Pines Conference Center hosted conferences, retreats and team-building programs. It consisted of 32 guest rooms and four conference rooms.

[ 26 ] The center’s client list ranged from small businesses, to teachers’ unions and big banks.

[ 27 ] Pop Culture [ edit ] In 2005 the W. Alton Jones campus was the base of the movie Hard Luck , featuring Wesley Snipes , Cybill Shepard , and Mario Van Peebles . The movie intertwines stories involving a drug dealer trying to go straight, and a housewife trying to hide a sadistic secret.

[ 28 ] Closing [ edit ] In June of 2020 the University of Rhode Island closed the Environmental Education Center and Whispering Pines Conference Center, citing financial hardships dating back several years.
