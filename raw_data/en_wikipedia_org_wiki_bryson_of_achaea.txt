Very little information is known about him. He was said to have been a pupil of Stilpo [ 1 ] and Clinomachus , [ 2 ] which would mean that he was a philosopher of the Megarian school . He was said to have taught Crates the Cynic , [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Pyrrho the Skeptic , [ 1 ] [ 2 ] and Theodorus the Atheist .

[ 5 ] Diogenes Laërtius includes him among a list of philosophers who left no writings.

[ 6 ] He is probably not the same person as Bryson of Heraclea , [ 7 ] the sophist and mathematician who seems to have lived in the time of Socrates . The Suda , in its entry on Socrates, [ 8 ] may be confusing the two Brysons when it refers to Bryson of Heraclea: Bryson of Heraclea introduced eristic dialectic after Euclides , [ 9 ] whereas Clinomachus augmented it, and whereas many came on account of it, it came to an end with Zeno of Citium , for he gave it the name Stoic , after its location , this having occurred in the 105th Olympiad ; [ 10 ] but some [say that] Bryson was a student not of Socrates but of Euclides Notes [ edit ] ^ a b Diogenes Laërtius, ix. 61. Diogenes Laërtius literally says "Pyrrho was a pupil of Bryson the son of Stilpo." Bryson is unlikely to have been the son of Stilpo. Laërtius may mean that Bryson was a pupil of Stilpo. This line is sometimes emended to "Pyrrho was a pupil of Bryson or Stilpo." ^ a b Suda, Pyrrhon ^ Diogenes Laërtius, vi. 85 ^ Suda, Krates ^ Suda, Theodoros ^ Diogenes Laërtius, i. 16 ^ "Not the same as Bryson of Heracleia, whom we know from the Platonic Epistles , from Aristotle , and from Athenaeus (xi. p. 508)." Robert Drew Hicks, Diogenes Laertius: Lives of Eminent Philosophers , page 88. Loeb Classical Library.

^ Suda, Sokrates ^ Cf. Diogenes Laërtius, ii. 106: "his [Euclid's] followers were called Megarians after him, then Eristics, and at a later date Dialecticians" ^ 360-357 BC, before Zeno was born, but possibly when Bryson was active.
