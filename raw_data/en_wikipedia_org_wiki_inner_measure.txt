Intuitively, the inner measure of a set is a lower bound of the size of that set.

Definition [ edit ] An inner measure is a set function φ φ : 2 X → → [ 0 , ∞ ∞ ] , {\displaystyle \varphi :2^{X}\to [0,\infty ],} defined on all subsets of a set X , {\displaystyle X,} that satisfies the following conditions: Null empty set: The empty set has zero inner measure ( see also: measure zero ); that is, φ φ ( ∅ ∅ ) = 0 {\displaystyle \varphi (\varnothing )=0} Superadditive : For any disjoint sets A {\displaystyle A} and B , {\displaystyle B,} φ φ ( A ∪ ∪ B ) ≥ ≥ φ φ ( A ) + φ φ ( B ) .

{\displaystyle \varphi (A\cup B)\geq \varphi (A)+\varphi (B).} Limits of decreasing towers: For any sequence A 1 , A 2 , … … {\displaystyle A_{1},A_{2},\ldots } of sets such that A j ⊇ ⊇ A j + 1 {\displaystyle A_{j}\supseteq A_{j+1}} for each j {\displaystyle j} and φ φ ( A 1 ) < ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \varphi (A_{1})<\infty } φ φ ( ⋂ ⋂ j = 1 ∞ ∞ A j ) = lim j → → ∞ ∞ φ φ ( A j ) {\displaystyle \varphi \left(\bigcap _{j=1}^{\infty }A_{j}\right)=\lim _{j\to \infty }\varphi (A_{j})} If the measure is not finite, that is, if there exist sets A {\displaystyle A} with φ φ ( A ) = ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \varphi (A)=\infty } , then this infinity must be approached. More precisely, if φ φ ( A ) = ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \varphi (A)=\infty } for a set A {\displaystyle A} then for every positive real number r , {\displaystyle r,} there exists some B ⊆ ⊆ A {\displaystyle B\subseteq A} such that r ≤ ≤ φ φ ( B ) < ∞ ∞ .

{\displaystyle r\leq \varphi (B)<\infty .} The inner measure induced by a measure [ edit ] Let Σ Σ {\displaystyle \Sigma } be a σ-algebra over a set X {\displaystyle X} and μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } be a measure on Σ Σ .

{\displaystyle \Sigma .} Then the inner measure μ μ ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle \mu _{*}} induced by μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } is defined by μ μ ∗ ∗ ( T ) = sup { μ μ ( S ) : S ∈ ∈ Σ Σ and S ⊆ ⊆ T } .

{\displaystyle \mu _{*}(T)=\sup\{\mu (S):S\in \Sigma {\text{ and }}S\subseteq T\}.} Essentially μ μ ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle \mu _{*}} gives a lower bound of the size of any set by ensuring it is at least as big as the μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } -measure of any of its Σ Σ {\displaystyle \Sigma } -measurable subsets. Even though the set function μ μ ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle \mu _{*}} is usually not a measure, μ μ ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle \mu _{*}} shares the following properties with measures: μ μ ∗ ∗ ( ∅ ∅ ) = 0 , {\displaystyle \mu _{*}(\varnothing )=0,} μ μ ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle \mu _{*}} is non-negative, If E ⊆ ⊆ F {\displaystyle E\subseteq F} then μ μ ∗ ∗ ( E ) ≤ ≤ μ μ ∗ ∗ ( F ) .

{\displaystyle \mu _{*}(E)\leq \mu _{*}(F).} Measure completion [ edit ] Main article: Complete measure Induced inner measures are often used in combination with outer measures to extend a measure to a larger σ-algebra. If μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } is a finite measure defined on a σ-algebra Σ Σ {\displaystyle \Sigma } over X {\displaystyle X} and μ μ ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle \mu ^{*}} and μ μ ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle \mu _{*}} are corresponding induced outer and inner measures, then the sets T ∈ ∈ 2 X {\displaystyle T\in 2^{X}} such that μ μ ∗ ∗ ( T ) = μ μ ∗ ∗ ( T ) {\displaystyle \mu _{*}(T)=\mu ^{*}(T)} form a σ-algebra Σ Σ ^ ^ {\displaystyle {\hat {\Sigma }}} with Σ Σ ⊆ ⊆ Σ Σ ^ ^ {\displaystyle \Sigma \subseteq {\hat {\Sigma }}} .

[ 1 ] The set function μ μ ^ ^ {\displaystyle {\hat {\mu }}} defined by μ μ ^ ^ ( T ) = μ μ ∗ ∗ ( T ) = μ μ ∗ ∗ ( T ) {\displaystyle {\hat {\mu }}(T)=\mu ^{*}(T)=\mu _{*}(T)} for all T ∈ ∈ Σ Σ ^ ^ {\displaystyle T\in {\hat {\Sigma }}} is a measure on Σ Σ ^ ^ {\displaystyle {\hat {\Sigma }}} known as the completion of μ μ .
