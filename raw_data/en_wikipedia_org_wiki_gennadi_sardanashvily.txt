[ 1 ] Biography [ edit ] Gennadi Sardanashvily graduated from Moscow State University (MSU) in 1973, he was a Ph.D. student of  the Department of Theoretical Physics ( MSU ) in 1973–76, where he held a position in 1976.

He attained his Ph.D. degree in physics and mathematics from MSU , in 1980, with Dmitri Ivanenko as his supervisor, and his D.Sc. degree in physics and mathematics from MSU , in 1998.

Gennadi Sardanashvily was the founder and Managing Editor (2003 - 2013) of the International Journal of Geometric Methods in Modern Physics (IJGMMP).

He was a member of Lepage Research Institute (Slovakia).

Research area [ edit ] Gennadi Sardanashvily research area is geometric method in classical and quantum mechanics and field theory , gravitation theory . His main achievement is geometric formulation of classical field theory and non-autonomous mechanics including: gauge gravitation theory , where gravity is treated as a classical Higgs field associated to a reduced Lorentz structure on a world manifold [ 2 ] geometric formulation of classical field theory [ 3 ] and Lagrangian BRST theory [ 4 ] where classical fields are represented by sections of fiber bundles and their dynamics is described in terms of jet manifolds and the variational bicomplex ( covariant classical field theory ) covariant (polysymplectic) Hamiltonian field theory , where momenta correspond to derivatives of fields with respect to all world coordinates [ 5 ] the second Noether theorem in a very general setting of reducible degenerate Grassmann-graded Lagrangian systems on an arbitrary manifold [ 6 ] geometric formulation of classical [ 7 ] and quantum [ 8 ] non-autonomous mechanics on fiber bundles over R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } generalization of the Liouville–Arnold, Nekhoroshev and Mishchenko–Fomenko theorems on completely and partially integrable and superintegrable Hamiltonian systems to the case of non-compact invariant submanifolds [ 9 ] cohomology of the variational bicomplex of graded differential forms of finite jet order on an infinite order jet manifold.

[ 10 ] Gennadi Sardanashvily has published more than 400 scientific works, including 28 books.
