It belongs to specialty rubbers . It has a continuous working temperature of 150 °C (302 °F) and an intermittent limit of 180 °C (356 °F). ACM is polar and lacks unsaturation. It is resistant to ozone and has low permeability to gases.

[ 1 ] Its disadvantage is its low resistance to moisture, acids , and bases . It should not be used in temperatures below −10 °C (14 °F).

It is commonly used in automotive transmissions and hoses.

[ 2 ] It is also used in shaft seals, adhesives, beltings, gaskets and O-rings .

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] It is used in vibration damping mounts due to the damping properties.
