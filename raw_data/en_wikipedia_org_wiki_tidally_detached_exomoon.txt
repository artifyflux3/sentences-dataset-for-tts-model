[ 3 ] [ 4 ] As of 2025, no tidally detached moons have yet been definitively detected, but they are believed to be likely to exist around other stars, and potentially detectable by photometric methods. Researchers at Columbia University have suggested that a disrupting detached exomoon may be causing the unusual fluctuations in brightness exhibited by Tabby's Star .

[ 5 ] History [ edit ] The term ploonet , a blend of the words planet and moon , [ 6 ] [ 7 ] was first used in a 2019 paper in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society .

[ 2 ] [ 8 ] It received attention from mainstream media sources, [ 2 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] with CNET calling it "charmingly goofy".
