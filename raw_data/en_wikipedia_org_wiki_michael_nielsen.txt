Michael Nielsen Michael Nielsen at Science Online London 2011 Born Michael Aaron Nielsen ( 1974-01-04 ) January 4, 1974 (age 51) Nationality Australian , American Alma mater University of New Mexico Known for Quantum Computation and Quantum Information Nielsen's theorem Awards Richard C. Tolman Prize Fellow at Caltech, Fulbright Scholar [ 1 ] Scientific career Fields Physics , Computer science Institutions Los Alamos National Laboratory Caltech University of Queensland Perimeter Institute Recurse Center Thesis Quantum Information Theory (1998) Doctoral advisor Carlton M. Caves [ 2 ] Website http://michaelnielsen.org Michael Aaron Nielsen (born January 4, 1974) is an Australian-American quantum physicist , science writer, and computer programming researcher living in San Francisco .

[ 3 ] Work [ edit ] In 1998, Nielsen received his PhD in physics from the University of New Mexico . In 2004, he was recognized as Australia's "youngest academic" and was awarded a Federation Fellowship at the University of Queensland .

[ 4 ] During this fellowship, he worked at the Los Alamos National Laboratory , Caltech , and at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics.

[ 2 ] Alongside Isaac Chuang , Nielsen co-authored a popular textbook on quantum computing , [ 5 ] which has been cited more than 52,000 times as of July 2023.

[ 6 ] In 2007, Nielsen shifted his focus from quantum information and computation to “the development of new tools for scientific collaboration and publication”, [ 7 ] including the Polymath project with Timothy Gowers , which aims to facilitate "massively collaborative mathematics." [ 8 ] Besides writing books and essays, he has also given talks about open science .

[ 9 ] He was a member of the Working Group on Open Data in Science at the Open Knowledge Foundation .

[ 10 ] Nielsen is a strong advocate for open science and has written extensively on the subject, including in his book Reinventing Discovery , which was favorably reviewed in Nature and named one of the Financial Times ' best books of 2011.

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] In 2015 Nielsen published the online textbook Neural Networks and Deep Learning , and joined the Recurse Center as a Research Fellow for a year.

[ 13 ] [ 14 ] He then joined Y Combinator Research as a Research Fellow from 2016 to 2019.

[ 15 ] In 2019, Nielsen collaborated with Andy Matuschak to develop Quantum Computing for the Very Curious , a series of interactive essays explaining quantum computing and quantum mechanics .

[ 16 ] With Patrick Collison , he researched whether scientific progress is slowing down.

[ 17 ] Nielsen resides in San Francisco.
