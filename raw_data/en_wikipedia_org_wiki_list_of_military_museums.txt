A military museum or war museum is an institution dedicated to the preservation and education of the significance of wars, conflicts, and military actions. These museums serve as repositories of artifacts (not least weapons), documents, photographs, and other memorabilia related to the military and war. Some of these institutions may also be used as a war memorial for a particular country or conflict.

These institutions vary in their scope and focus, with some museums dedicated to a specific national or regional context and chronicling the military history of a particular country or region, while other museums may concentrate on a particular conflict, era, service, technology (like an artillery museum ), or unit (like a regimental museum ).
