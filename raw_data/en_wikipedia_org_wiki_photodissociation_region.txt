[ 1 ] In astrophysics , photodissociation regions (or photon-dominated regions , PDRs ) are predominantly neutral regions of the interstellar medium in which far ultraviolet photons strongly influence the gas chemistry and act as the most important source of heat.

[ 2 ] They constitute a sort of shell around sources of far-UV photons at a distance where the interstellar gas is dense enough, and the flux from the photon source is no longer strong enough, to strip electrons from the neutral constituent atoms.

[ 3 ] Despite being composed of denser gas, PDRs still have too low a column density to prevent the penetration of far-UV photons from distant, massive stars . PDRs are also composed of a cold molecular zone that has the potential for star formation.

[ 4 ] They achieve this cooling by far-infrared fine line emissions of neutral oxygen and ionized carbon.

[ 5 ] It is theorized that PDRs are able to maintain their shape by trapped magnetic fields originating from the far-UV source.

[ 6 ] A typical and well-studied example is the gas at the boundary of a giant molecular cloud .

[ 2 ] PDRs are also associated with HII regions , reflection nebulae , active galactic nuclei , and Planetary nebulae .

[ 7 ] All of a galaxy's atomic gas and most of its molecular gas is found in PDRs.

[ 8 ] The closest PDRs to the Sun are IC 59 and IC 63 , near the bright Be star Gamma Cassiopeiae .

[ 9 ] History [ edit ] The study of photodissociation regions began from early observations of the star-forming regions Orion A and M17 which showed neutral areas bright in infrared radiation lying outside ionised HII regions .
