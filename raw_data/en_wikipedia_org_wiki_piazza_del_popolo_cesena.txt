( September 2023 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Piazza del Popolo The Piazza del Popolo ("People's Square") is located at the heart of Cesena , Italy, and offers some of the most interesting town sights.

In the middle of the square there stands the Mannerist Fontana del Masini (1588–91), designed by the local painter-architect Francesco Masini, in collaboration, for the hydraulics, with Tommaso Laureti . On the southern side of the square there stands the Palazzo Comunale ( Town Hall ). Next to the Palazzo Comunale there are Loggetta Veneziana and Rocchetta di Piazza , built in the 15th century.

The Chiesa dei Santi Anna e Gioacchino ( Church of St. Anna and St. Gioacchino ) takes up the northern side of the square. During the fascist period the name of the square was "Piazza Vittorio Emanuele", honoring the king; the name "Piazza del Popolo" was restored after the second world war.
