Women's suffrage organizations Categories Women's rights by country Feminists by nationality Feminism portal v t e International Women's Day ( IWD ) is celebrated on 8 March, commemorating women's fight for equality and liberation along with the women's rights movement . International Women's Day gives focus to issues such as gender equality , reproductive rights , and violence and abuse against women .

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] Spurred by the universal female suffrage movement, International Women's Day originated from labor movements in Europe and North America during the early 20th century.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] The earliest version reported was a " Woman's Day " organized by the Socialist Party of America in New York City on 28 February 1909. In solidarity with them, communist activist and politician Clara Zetkin proposed the celebration of "Working Women's Day", approved at the 1910 International Socialist Women's Conference in Copenhagen , albeit with no set date; [ 8 ] the following year saw the first demonstrations and commemorations of International Women's Day across Europe.

Vladimir Lenin declared 8 March as International Women's Day in 1922 to honour the women's role in the 1917 Russian Revolution ; [ 9 ] it was subsequently celebrated on that date by the socialist movement and communist countries . The holiday was promoted by the United Nations in 1977.

[ 10 ] International Women's Day is a public holiday in several countries. 
The UN observes the holiday in connection with a particular issue, campaign, or theme in women's rights.

[ 6 ] History [ edit ] Origins [ edit ] Clara Zetkin (left) and Rosa Luxemburg (right) in January 1910 The earliest reported Women's Day event, called " Woman's Day ", [ 11 ] was held on 28 February 1909, in New York City. It was organized by the Socialist Party of America [ 12 ] at the suggestion of activist Theresa Malkiel .

[ 13 ] There have been claims that the day was commemorating a protest by women garment workers in New York on 8 March 1857, but researchers have described this as a myth.

[ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] In August 1910, an International Socialist Women's Conference was organized ahead of the general meeting of the Socialist Second International in Copenhagen, Denmark.

[ 17 ] Inspired in part by the American socialists, German delegates Clara Zetkin , Käte Duncker , Paula Thiede , and others proposed the establishment of an annual "Women's Day", although no date was specified.

[ 8 ] [ 14 ] [ 18 ] The 100 delegates, representing 17 countries, agreed with the idea as a strategy to promote equal rights, including women's suffrage .

[ 19 ] The following year, on 19 March 1911, the first International Women's Day was marked by over a million people in Austria-Hungary, Denmark, Germany, and Switzerland.

[ 12 ] In Austria-Hungary alone, there were 300 demonstrations, [ 14 ] with women parading on the Ringstrasse in Vienna, carrying banners honoring the martyrs of the Paris Commune .

[ 14 ] Across Europe, women demanded the right to vote and to hold public office, and protested against employment sex discrimination.

[ 4 ] International Women's Day initially had no set date, though it was generally celebrated in late February or early March. Americans continued to observe " Woman's Day " on the last Sunday in February, while Russia observed International Women's Day for the first time in 1913, on the last Saturday in February (albeit based on the Julian calendar , as in the Gregorian calendar, the date was 8 March).

[ 20 ] In 1914, International Women's Day was held on 8 March for the first time in Germany, possibly because that date was a Sunday.

[ 20 ] As elsewhere, Germany's observance was dedicated to women's right to vote, which German women did not win until 1918.

[ 20 ] [ 21 ] Concurrently, there was a march in London in support of women's suffrage, during which Sylvia Pankhurst was arrested in front of Charing Cross station on her way to speak in Trafalgar Square .

[ 22 ] The Russian Revolution and Communist countries [ edit ] Soviet postage stamps On 8 March 1917, in Petrograd (23 February in the Julian calendar ), women textile workers began a demonstration that eventually engulfed the whole city, demanding "Bread and Peace"—an end to World War I, to food shortages, and to Tsarism .

[ 20 ] This marked the beginning of the February Revolution , which alongside the October Revolution , made up the Russian Revolution .

[ 4 ] [ 23 ] Revolutionary leader Leon Trotsky wrote, "23 February (8 March) was International Woman's Day and meetings and actions were foreseen. But we did not imagine that this 'Women's Day' would inaugurate the revolution. Revolutionary actions were foreseen but without a date. But in the morning, despite the orders to the contrary, textile workers left their work in several factories and sent delegates to ask for the support of the strike… which led to mass strike... all went out into the streets." [ 20 ] Seven days later, Tsar Nicholas II abdicated, and the provisional Government granted women the right to vote.

[ 12 ] After the Russian Revolution, Bolsheviks began to celebrate the International Women's Day on 8 March as it marked the beginning of revolutionary changes in 1917 in Russia. However, it was not officially declared as such for some time. For example, the first congress of the newly founded Communist International could only adopt a very brief "Resolution on the Role of Working Women" submitted by Alexandra Kollontai on 6 March 1919, which made no mention of 8 March or International Women's Day. The second congress convened next year couldn't even find time for it, although it began holding an "International Conference of Communist Women" (organized by a newly created "International Secretariat on Work Amongst Women") under its auspices.

It was only during the third world congress of Communist International in 1921 that an important document titled "Methods and Forms of Work Among Communist Party Women: Theses" was adopted as a result of the work of the Second International Conference of Communist Women held in parallel to this congress. The theses mentioned "organizing an annual International Working Women's Day" among the tasks of central women's department of communist parties.

[ 24 ] The date of International Women's Day was also first fixed as March 8 at this Second International Conference of Communist Women.

[ 25 ] [ 26 ] At the final evening session, the Bulgarian delegation presented a resolution on the need to celebrate International Women's Day on a single date throughout the world. Nikolaeva, a representative of the RSFSR, proposed to set the current date (March 8) in memory of the participation of Petrograd women in the demonstrations of March 8, 1917 that led to the overthrow of the monarchy, which was approved unanimously.

[ 27 ] After its adoption in Soviet Russia , International Women's Day was predominantly celebrated in communist countries and by the communist movement worldwide. In the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic , huge Soviet-style celebrations were held annually.

[ 28 ] Chinese communists observed the holiday beginning in 1922, [ 14 ] though it soon gained traction across the political spectrum . In 1927, Guangzhou saw a march of 25,000 women and male supporters, including representatives of the Kuomintang , the YWCA , and labor organizations.

[ 29 ] After the founding of the People's Republic of China on 1 October 1949, the State Council proclaimed on 23 December that 8 March would be made an official holiday, with women given a half-day off.

[ 30 ] Hujum (Russian: Худжум , romanized : Khudzhum , IPA: [xʊd͡ʐʐʊm] ; in Turkic languages , storming or assault , from Arabic : هجوم ) was a series of policies and actions taken by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union , initiated by Joseph Stalin on International Women's Day in 1927, to remove all manifestations of gender inequality , especially the systems of female veiling and seclusion practiced in Central Asia .

[ 31 ] [ 32 ] On 8 May 1965, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet issued a decree to make 8 March, International Women's Day, a non-working public holiday 'in honor of the outstanding achievements of the Soviet women in building communism, defending the motherland during the Great Patriotic War , their heroism and selflessness both at the front and at home, and for their great contribution to the strengthening of friendship among peoples, and to the struggle for peace'.

[ 33 ] A veil -burning ceremony in Andijan on International Women's Day in 1927 Other countries, 1920s to 1960s [ edit ] In 1928, Australia first observed International Women's Day, a rally in Sydney's Domain organized by the Militant Women's Group of the Communist Party.

[ 34 ] At that rally, held on 25 March, women rallied in support of fully paid annual holidays, equal pay for equal work, female store clerks having eight-hour days, an end to piece work , and a basic wage for those without employment.

[ 35 ] Later, the first International Women's Day marches happened in Sydney and Melbourne, in 1931. The Sydney march featured approximately sixty women leading three hundred to five hundred marchers. The Melbourne march consisted of fifty women leading one hundred and fifty marchers, with a banner in front stating, "Long Live International Women's Day". In 1938, the first major International Women's Day meeting in Perth was held; in attendance were women from the Association of University Women, Jewish Women, Mothers Union , Movement Against War and Fascism , National Council of Women , Spanish Relief Committee, Women's Christian Temperance Union , Women's International League for Peace and Freedom , Women's Section of Primary Producers , Women's Service Guilds , Young Labor League, and YWCA .

[ 35 ] Communist leader Dolores Ibárruri led a women's march in Madrid in 1936 on the eve of the Spanish Civil War .

[ 14 ] The Congress of American Women was an American women's rights organization founded in New York on International Women's Day in 1946, following the 1945 founding conference of the Women's International Democratic Federation in Paris, to which it affiliated. Its primary organizer was Elinor S. Gimbel (wife of Louis S. Gimbel, Jr., grandson of Adam Gimbel of Gimbels department store.

[ 36 ] ) In 1948 the organization was attacked as a communist front organization by the House Un-American Activities Committee and was forced to register as a "subversive" organization. The organization was finally dissolved in 1950. The congress was an official US branch of the Women's International Democratic Federation , which though an antifascist organization was pro-Soviet.

[ 37 ] The organization supported progressive policies giving women full rights and equality both in the home and economically. They supported labor organizing and civil rights and were against anticommunist attacks on liberals.

[ 38 ] Though many members were communists or part of the popular front , membership in the organization included a broad mix of liberal, middle-class women.

[ 37 ] In 1956 in Singapore, Chan Choy Siong , along with Ho Puay Choo and Oh Siew Chen, created the Women's League within the People's Action Party , and that year, to recognize International Women's Day, the League organized four rallies across Singapore, which attracted more than 2,000 people in total.

[ 39 ] [ 40 ] In 1958, Christina F. Lewis organized the first International Women's Day observance in Trinidad and Tobago .

[ 41 ] In 1965, Anahita Ratebzad along with other members of the Democratic Organisation of Afghan Women (DOAW) organized a protest march on 8 March in Kabul , which was the first observance of International Women's Day in Afghanistan.

[ 42 ] Second–wave feminism [ edit ] Female members of the Australian Builders Labourers Federation march on International Women's Day 1975 in Sydney International Women's Day remained predominantly a communist holiday until circa 1967 when it was taken up by second-wave feminists .

[ 14 ] The day re-emerged as a day of activism, and is sometimes known in Europe as the "Women's International Day of Struggle". In the 1970s and 1980s, women's groups were joined by leftists and labor organizations in calling for equal pay, equal economic opportunity, equal legal rights, reproductive rights , subsidized child care, and the prevention of violence against women.

[ 43 ] [ 44 ] International Women's Day had been largely forgotten in the United States by the late 1960s, before an activist called Laura X organized a march in Berkeley, California, on International Women's Day in 1969.

[ 45 ] The march led to the creation of The Women's History Research Center, a central archive of the women's movement from 1968 to 1974.

[ 46 ] Laura X also thought it unfair for half the human race, meaning women, to have only one day a year and called for National Women's History Month to be built around International Women's Day.

[ 47 ] The Women's History Research Center collected nearly one million documents on microfilm, and provided resources and records of the women's liberation movement that are now available through the National Women's History Alliance, which carried on their ideas, including successfully petitioning Congress to declare March as Women's History Month.

[ 48 ] In Australia, 1972 was when large International Women's Day marches began.

[ 34 ] Adoption by United Nations [ edit ] The United Nations began celebrating International Women's Day in 1975, which had been proclaimed the International Women's Year . In 1977, the United Nations General Assembly invited member states to "proclaim in accordance with their historical and national traditions and customs, any day of the year as United Nations Day for Women's Rights and International Peace" .

[ 49 ] [ 50 ] In common with most countries, 8 March has been traditionally recognised as the day for International Women's Days by the UN for women's rights and world peace .

[ 51 ] It has since been commemorated annually by the UN and much of the world, with each year's observance centered on a particular theme or issue within women's rights.

Announced in 1978 on International Women's Day, the Women's Work Committee in Palestine came to represent an association willing to develop a strategy to combine national liberation and women's liberation. The founders of the committee were disappointed in the actions of previous charitable societies as they failed to educate the general population; to rectify this issue, they launched programs promoting literacy, health education, and classes teaching embroidery. Further aiding those of a working-class background, they started daycare centers to allow them to continue working as their children were being cared for.

[ 52 ] On International Women's Day in 1979 , a women's march took place in Tehran in Iran . The march was originally intended to celebrate International Women's Day, but transformed into massive protests against the changes taking place in women's rights during the Iranian revolution , specifically the introduction of mandatory hijab (veiling), which had been announced the day before. The protests lasted for six days, from 8 March to 14 March 1979, with thousands of women participating. The protests resulted in a temporary retraction of the decree of mandatory veiling. When the left and the liberals were eliminated, and the conservatives secured sole control, however, veiling was enforced on all women.

[ 53 ] María Elena Oddone holding a banner, on International Women's Day in 1984 in Argentina. The banner says "No to motherhood, yes to pleasure" On 8 March 1984 in Argentina, the first International Women's Day demonstrations since the end of the country's military regime took place in the Congressional Plaza , in what is now considered a landmark.

[ 54 ] The event was organized by the Multisectorial de la Mujer (English: Multisectorial of Women), an organization formed by members of women's groups, feminists, housewives and representatives of political parties and unions.

[ 54 ] An emblematic moment of the protests was when activist María Elena Oddone climbed up the stairs of the Monument of the Two Congresses and raised a banner that read "No to motherhood, yes to pleasure". Her banner, as well as those held by other radical feminists that day, was harshly criticized by the press for being too provocative. Oddone was also repudiated within the feminist movement. Elena Tchalidy, president of the Alicia Moreau de Justo Foundation, said: "8 March was the first public act and she walked with [that sign]. It came out in the magazine that today would be Caras or Gente . Then she said to me: 'Oh, three girls came to me.' 'Yes', I told her, 'and you distanced a few thousand.' [ 54 ] Oddone recalled the meeting with the Multisectorial de la Mujer that took place two days after the event in her autobiography, claiming she replied to their "lapidary critics": "I am not a feminist to please anyone but to tell the truth about our condition. I did not write those banners to be liked. If they caused scandal, it is because the truth is always scandalous. We received Dr. Justo with admiration and affection. Eighty years ago, she and her companions who asked for the right to vote were called 'crazy'. I am willing to wait the same number of years for my banners to be understood." [ 55 ] Adoption by corporations [ edit ] By the twenty-first century, International Women's Day had been criticized as heavily diluted and commercialized, particularly in the West, where it is sponsored by major corporations and used to promote general and vague notions of equality, rather than radical social reforms.

[ 56 ] The website internationalwomensday.com was established in 2001.

[ 57 ] The website was being managed by the British marketing firm Aurora Ventures with corporate sponsorship.

[ 58 ] [ 59 ] The website began to promote hashtags as themes for the day, unconnected with the UN theme, which became used internationally.

[ 57 ] [ 60 ] The day was commemorated by business breakfasts and social media communications that were deemed by some social critics as reminiscent of Mother's Day greetings.

Women's Day, 8 March 1914. Until now, prejudice and reactionary attitudes have denied full civic rights to women, who as workers, mothers, and citizens wholly fulfill their duty, who must pay their taxes to the state as well as the municipality. Fighting for this natural human right must be the firm, unwavering intention of every woman, every female worker. In this, no pause for rest, no respite is allowed. Come all, you women and girls, to the ninth public women's assembly on Sunday, 8 March 1914, at 3 pm." [ 1 ] References [ edit ] ^ "Give Us Women's Suffrage (March 1914)" .

Then there was a resolution by the Bulgarian Delegation that the International Women's Day should take place on the same day in all countries of the East and West. Comrade Kollontai proposed that they should not fix a day now, but they should leave it to the International Secretariat. Comrade Nicholayeva proposed that the day should not be changed, as on that historic day the women of Petrograd first rose against Tzarism. Comrade Nicholayeva's proposal was accepted unanimously, and the 8th of March was approved as the International Day of Working Women.
