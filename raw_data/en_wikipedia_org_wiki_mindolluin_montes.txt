The range is located near Titan's equator, between 1–4° south and 205–213° east.

[ 1 ] It is located within the Adiri region, just west of the landing site of the Huygens probe .

[ 2 ] The Mindolluin Montes are named after Mindolluin , one of the White Mountains in J. R. R. Tolkien 's fictional world of Middle-earth .

[ 1 ] The name follows a convention that Titanean mountains are after mountains in Tolkien's work.

[ 3 ] It was formally announced on November 13, 2012.
