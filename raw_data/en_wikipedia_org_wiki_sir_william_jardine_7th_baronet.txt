[ 2 ] [ 3 ] He is known for his editing of a long series of natural history books, The Naturalist's Library .

Life and work [ edit ] Jardine c. 1870, an illustration accompanying his obituary in the Illustrated London News [ 4 ] Painting of silver-throated tanager and flame-faced tanager, by Jardine's daughter, 1851 Jardine was born on 23 February 1800 at 28 North Hanover Street [ 5 ] in Edinburgh , the son of Sir Alexander Jardine, 6th baronet of Applegarth and his wife, Jane Maule. He was educated in both York and Edinburgh then studied medicine at Edinburgh University .

[ 6 ] From 1817 to 1821 he lodged with Rev Dr Andrew Grant at James Square, an arrangement made by his father. Grant was minister of St Andrew's Church on George Street.

[ 7 ] In his early years, aged only 25, he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh his proposer being Sir David Brewster .

[ 6 ] He was a co-founder of the Berwickshire Naturalists' Club, and contributed to the founding of the Ray Society .

[ 8 ] He was "keenly addicted to field-sports, and a master equally of the rod and the gun". While ornithology was his main passion, he also studied ichthyology, botany and geology. His book on fossil burrows and traces, the Ichnology of Annandale , included fossils from his ancestral estate.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] He was the first to coin the term ichnology , and this was the first book written on the subject.

[ 11 ] His private natural history museum and library are said to have been the finest in Britain.

[ 12 ] Jardine made natural history available to all levels of Victorian society by editing the hugely popular forty volumes of The Naturalist's Library (1833–1843) issued and published by his brother in law, the Edinburgh printer and engraver, William Home Lizars .

[ 13 ] The series was divided into four main sections: Ornithology (14 volumes), Mammalia (13 volumes), Entomology (7 volumes), and Ichthyology (6 volumes); each prepared by a leading naturalist.

James Duncan wrote the insect volumes. The artists responsible for the illustrations included Edward Lear .

[ 14 ] The work was published in Edinburgh by W. H. Lizars . The frontispiece is a portrait of Pierre André Latreille .

His other publications included an edition of Gilbert White 's Natural History of Selborne which re-established White's reputation, Illustrations of Ornithology (1825–1843), and an affordable edition of Alexander Wilson 's Birds of America .

Jardine described of a number of bird species, alone or in conjunction with his friend Prideaux John Selby . He died on 21 November 1874 in Sandown , Isle of Wight.

Family and descendants [ edit ] He was married to Jane Home Lizars, and through her was brother-in-law to John Lizars FRSE and William Home Lizars .

[ 15 ] After Lady Jardine's death he married the daughter of the Rev.

William Samuel Symonds , the well-known geologist.

Jardine's daughter, Catherine Dorcas Maule Jardine, married Hugh Edwin Strickland and produced many of the illustrations for Illustrations of Ornithology (identifiable by her initials, CDMS).

The Olympic rower Sir Matthew Pinsent is a direct descendant of Jardine.
