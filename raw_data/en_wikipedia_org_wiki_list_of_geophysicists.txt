These include historical figures who laid the foundations for the field of geophysics.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] More recently, some of the top awards for geophysicists are the Vetlesen Prize (intended to be the equivalent of a Nobel Prize for geology or geophysics); the William Bowie Medal (the top award of the American Geophysical Union ); the Maurice Ewing Medal (the top award of the Society of Exploration Geophysicists ); and the Crafoord Prize for geosciences. Some geophysicists have also won more general prizes such as the Nobel Prize and the Kyoto Prize .
