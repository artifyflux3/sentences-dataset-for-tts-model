Times are shown relative to 2019 August 14, 21:10:39 UTC. Each detector's data are whitened by their respective noise amplitude spectral density and a Q-transform is calculated. The colorbar displays the normalized energy reported by the Q-transform at each frequency. These plots are not used in our detection procedure and are for visualization purposes only.

Gravitational wave Date 21:10:39 UTC Instrument LIGO , Virgo [ 1 ] [ 2 ] Right ascension 03h 33m Declination 04h 45m Epoch J2000.0 Distance 241 megaparsecs (790 Mly ) [ 1 ] Other designations GW190814 Related media on Commons [ edit on Wikidata ] GW 190814 was a gravitational wave (GW) signal observed by the LIGO and Virgo detectors on 14 August 2019 at 21:10:39 UTC, [ 2 ] and having a signal-to-noise ratio of 25 in the three-detector network.

[ 1 ] The signal was associated with the astronomical super event S190814bv , located 790 million light years away, in location area 18.5 deg 2 [ n 1 ] [ 1 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] towards Cetus or Sculptor .

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] No optical counterpart was discovered despite an extensive search of the probability region.

[ 11 ] Discovery [ edit ] Simulated example of two black holes merging.

In June 2020, astronomers reported details of a compact binary merging, in the " mass gap " of cosmic collisions, of a first-ever 2.50–2.67 M ☉ "mystery object", either an extremely heavy neutron star (that was theorized not to exist) or a too-light black hole , with a 22.2–24.3 M ☉ black hole, that was detected as the gravitational wave GW190814.

[ 1 ] [ 12 ] "We don't know if this object is the heaviest known neutron star or the lightest known black hole, but either way it breaks a record." — Vicky Kalogera, professor at Northwestern University .

[ 13 ] The mass of the lighter component is estimated to be 2.6 times the mass of the Sun ( M ☉ ≈ 1.9891 × 10 30 kg ), placing it in the aforementioned mass gap between neutron stars and black holes.

[ 1 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] Despite an intensive search, no optical counterpart to the gravitational wave was observed. The lack of emitted light could be consistent with either a situation in which a black hole entirely consumed a neutron star or the merger of two black holes.
