It is owned by Performance Once Media, LLC, a media company based in Centennial, Colorado. The network launched in 2018 originally as America's Voice News and rebranded to Real America's Voice in September 2020.

[ 2 ] History [ edit ] The network is owned by Robert J. Sigg [ 3 ] [ 4 ] and is a sister channel to WeatherNation TV .

[ 3 ] It is of no relation to the former National Empowerment Television of the late 1990s, which rebranded to America's Voice in its final years.

Sigg launched Real America's Voice through his company, Performance One Media in 2018. The company had previously operated WeatherNation before expanding into political media.

[ 3 ] The rebranding in 2020 coincided with a broader push into conservative political commentary and live-streaming of pro-Trump rallies. During the 2020 election cycle, Real America's Voice gained popularity among conservative viewers and expanded its reach through streaming platforms and satellite TV distribution.

[ 3 ] Real America's Voice has been described as a conservative [ 5 ] and right-wing [ 1 ] outlet. The network and online presences have promoted right-wing and far-right conspiracy theories, including COVID-19 misinformation , 2020 election conspiracies , and QAnon .

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] On April 15, 2024, pro-trans hacktivism group SiegedSec claimed that they had hacked Real America's Voice's Amazon Web Services host. They proceeded to leak personal information on 1200+ users, along with wiping their Amazon S3 Buckets.

[ 9 ] Programming [ edit ] Shows airing on Real America's Voice include "War Room: Pandemic" hosted by Steve Bannon [ 3 ] , "Just the News, No Noise" hosted by John Solomon [ 10 ] , "American Sunrise" hosted by Terrance Bates, David Brody , Miranda Khan and Dr.

Gina Loudon [ 11 ] ,  "The Charlie Kirk show" [ 12 ] , " Human Events Daily" hosted by Jack Posobiec , "Securing America" hosted by Frank Gaffney [ 13 ] ,  " Ted Nugent Spirit Campfire" [ 14 ] , "The Royce White Show", "America’s Top 10 Countdown" hosted by Wayne Allyn Root , "Cowboy Logic" hosted by Donna Fiducia and Don Neuen, "Firewall" with Lance Wallnau , and"Free Chapel" with Jentezen Franklin .
Previous notable network personalities included former Missouri governor Eric Greitens , [ 3 ] 2022 Michigan Republican gubernatorial nominee Tudor Dixon , [ 15 ] and journalist Ed Henry .
