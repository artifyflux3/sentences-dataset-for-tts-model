Despite rainfall totals low enough to normally classify as a desert , polar deserts are distinguished from true deserts ( BWh or BWk under the Köppen classification) by low annual temperatures and evapotranspiration . Most polar deserts are covered in ice sheets , ice fields , or ice caps , and they are also called white deserts .

[ 1 ] Polar deserts are one of two polar biomes , the other being Arctic tundra . These biomes are located at the poles of Earth, covering much of the Antarctic in the southern hemisphere, and in the northern hemisphere extending from the Arctic into North America , Europe and Asia . Unlike the tundra that can support plant and animal life in the summer, polar deserts are largely barren environments, comprising permanent, flat layers of ice; [ 2 ] due to the scarcity of liquid water, the same is also true of the few ice-free areas. However, there is evidence of some life in this seemingly inhospitable landscape: sediments of organic and inorganic substances in the thick ice hosting microbial organisms closely related to cyanobacteria , able to fix carbon dioxide from the melting water.

[ 3 ] Temperature changes in polar deserts frequently cross the freezing point of water. This "freeze-thaw" alternation forms patterned textures on the ground, as much as 5 m (16 ft) in diameter.

Most of the interior of Antarctica is polar desert, despite the thick ice cover. Conversely, the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica , although they have had no ice for thousands of years due to katabatic wind but contain ephemeral streams and hypersaline lakes characteristic of extreme non-polar deserts, are not necessarily polar desert.

[ citation needed ] Polar deserts are relatively common during ice ages , as ice ages tend to be dry.

[ citation needed ] Climate scientists have voiced concerns about the effects of global warming to the ice poles in these polar biomes.
