Geologic time shown in a diagram called a geological clock, showing the relative lengths of the eons of Earth's history and noting major events

The **geological history of Earth** follows the major geological events in Earth's past based on the [geologic time scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geologic_time_scale "Geologic time scale"), a system of [chronological measurement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronological_dating "Chronological dating") based on the study of the planet's rock layers ([stratigraphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratigraphy "Stratigraphy")). Earth formed [approximately 4.54 billion years ago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Earth "Age of Earth") through accretion from the [solar nebula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_nebula "Solar nebula"), a disk-shaped mass of dust and gas remaining from the formation of the Sun, which also formed the rest of the [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System "Solar System").

Initially, Earth was molten due to extreme [volcanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanism "Volcanism") and frequent collisions with other bodies. Eventually, the outer layer of the planet cooled to form a solid [crust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crust_(geology) "Crust (geology)") when water began accumulating in the atmosphere. The [Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon "Moon") formed soon afterwards, possibly as a result of the impact of a planetoid with Earth. [Outgassing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outgassing "Outgassing") and volcanic activity produced the primordial atmosphere. [Condensing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condensation "Condensation")[water vapor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_vapor "Water vapor"), augmented by ice delivered from [asteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid "Asteroid"), [produced the oceans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_of_water_on_Earth "Origin of water on Earth"). However, in 2020, researchers reported that [sufficient water to fill the oceans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_of_water_on_Earth "Origin of water on Earth") may have always been on [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth") since the beginning of the planet's formation.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-SCI-20200828-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-SCI-20200827wu-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-SCI-20200827aa-3)

As the surface continually reshaped itself over hundreds of millions of years, continents formed and broke apart. They [migrated across the surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics "Plate tectonics"), occasionally combining to form a [supercontinent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercontinent "Supercontinent"). Roughly [750](https://geoltime.github.io/?Ma=750)million years ago, the earliest-known supercontinent [Rodinia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodinia "Rodinia"), began to break apart. The continents later recombined to form [Pannotia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pannotia "Pannotia"), [600 to 540](https://geoltime.github.io/?Ma=600%E2%80%93540) million years ago, then finally [Pangaea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangaea "Pangaea"), which broke apart [200](https://geoltime.github.io/?Ma=200)million years ago.

The present pattern of [ice ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_age "Ice age") began about [40](https://geoltime.github.io/?Ma=40)million years ago, then intensified at the end of the [Pliocene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pliocene "Pliocene"). The polar regions have since undergone repeated cycles of glaciation and thawing, repeating every 40,000–100,000 years. The [Last Glacial Period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Glacial_Period "Last Glacial Period") of the [current ice age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternary_glaciation "Quaternary glaciation") ended about 10,000 years ago.

The Precambrian includes approximately 90% of geologic time. It extends from 4.6 billion years ago to the beginning of the Cambrian Period (about 539 million years ago). It includes the first three of the four [eons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geologic_time_scale#Divisions_of_geologic_time "Geologic time scale") of Earth's prehistory (the [Hadean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadean "Hadean"), [Archean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archean "Archean"), and [Proterozoic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proterozoic "Proterozoic")) and precedes the [Phanerozoic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phanerozoic "Phanerozoic") eon.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-6)

Major volcanic events altering Earth's environment and causing [extinctions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction "Extinction") may have occurred 10 times in the past 3 billion years.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-7)

During Hadean time (4.6–4 [Ga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annum "Annum")), the [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System "Solar System") was forming, probably within a large cloud of gas and dust around the Sun, called an [accretion disc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accretion_disc "Accretion disc") from which [Earth formed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Earth#Origin_of_life "History of Earth")[4,500](https://geoltime.github.io/?Ma=4,500)million years ago.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-age_earth-8) The Hadean Eon is not formally recognized, but it essentially marks the era before we have adequate record of significant solid rocks. The oldest dated [zircons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zircon "Zircon") date from about [4,400](https://geoltime.github.io/?Ma=4,400)million years ago.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-9)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-ICS2015-10)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-11)

[Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth") was initially molten due to extreme [volcanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanism "Volcanism") and frequent collisions with other bodies. Eventually, the outer layer of the planet cooled to form a solid [crust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crust_(geology) "Crust (geology)") when water began accumulating in the atmosphere. The [Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon "Moon") formed soon afterwards, possibly as a result of the [impact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_impact_hypothesis "Giant impact hypothesis") of a large planetoid with Earth.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-12)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-13) More recent potassium isotopic studies suggest that the Moon was formed by a smaller, high-energy, high-angular-momentum giant impact cleaving off a significant portion of Earth.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-14) Some of this object's mass merged with Earth, significantly altering its internal composition, and a portion was ejected into space. Some of the material survived to form the orbiting Moon. Outgassing and [volcanic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcano "Volcano") activity produced the primordial atmosphere. Condensing [water vapor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_vapor "Water vapor"), augmented by ice delivered from [comets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet "Comet"), [produced the oceans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_of_the_world%27s_oceans "Origin of the world's oceans").[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-15) However, in 2020, researchers reported that [sufficient water to fill the oceans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_of_water_on_Earth "Origin of water on Earth") may have always been on [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth") since the beginning of the [planet's formation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth#Formation "Earth").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-SCI-20200828-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-SCI-20200827wu-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-SCI-20200827aa-3)

During the Hadean the [Late Heavy Bombardment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Heavy_Bombardment "Late Heavy Bombardment") occurred (approximately [4,100 to 3,800](https://geoltime.github.io/?Ma=4100%E2%80%933800) million years ago) during which a large number of impact craters are believed to have formed on the Moon, and by inference on Earth, [Mercury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(planet) "Mercury (planet)"), [Venus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus "Venus"), and [Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars "Mars") as well. However, some scientists argue against this hypothetical Late Heavy Bombardment, pointing out that the conclusion has been drawn from data which are not fully representative (only a few crater hotspots on the Moon have been analyzed).[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-16)[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-17)

Artist's impression of Earth during its second [eon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eon_(geology) "Eon (geology)"), the [Archean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archean "Archean"). The eon started with the [Late Heavy Bombardment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Heavy_Bombardment "Late Heavy Bombardment") around 4.031 billion years ago. As depicted,Earth's [planetary crust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_crust "Earth's crust") had largely cooled, leaving a water-rich barren [surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_surface "Planetary surface") marked by [volcanoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcano "Volcano") and [continents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continent "Continent"), eventually developing [round](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromatolite "Stromatolite")[microbialites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbialite "Microbialite"). The Moon orbited Earth much closer, appearing much larger, producing more frequent and wider [eclipses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse "Eclipse") as well as [tidal effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_effect "Tidal effect").[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-Lunar_and_Planetary_Institute-18)

Earth of the early Archean ([4,031 to 2,500](https://geoltime.github.io/?Ma=4031%E2%80%932500) million years ago) may have had a different tectonic style. It is widely believed that the early Earth was dominated by vertical tectonic processes, such as [stagnant lid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stagnant_lid "Stagnant lid"),[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-19)[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-20)[heat-pipe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat-pipe_tectonics "Heat-pipe tectonics"),[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-21) or [sagduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sagduction&action=edit&redlink=1 "Sagduction (page does not exist)"),[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-22)[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-23)[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-24) which eventually transitioned to plate tectonics during the planet's mid-stage evolution. However, an alternative view proposes that Earth never experienced a vertical tectonic phase and that plate tectonics have been active throughout its entire history.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-25)[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-26)[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-27) During this time, Earth's [crust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crust_(geology) "Crust (geology)") cooled enough that rocks and continental plates began to form. Some scientists think because Earth was hotter in the past,[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-28)[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-29) plate tectonic activity was more vigorous than it is today, resulting in a much greater rate of recycling of crustal material. This may have prevented [cratonization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craton "Craton") and continent formation until the [mantle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantle_(geology) "Mantle (geology)") cooled and convection slowed down. Others argue that the subcontinental lithospheric mantle is too buoyant to [subduct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subduction "Subduction") and that the lack of Archean rocks is a function of [erosion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erosion "Erosion") and subsequent [tectonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tectonic "Tectonic") events. Some geologists view the sudden increase in aluminum content in zircons as an indicator of the beginning of [plate tectonics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics "Plate tectonics").[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-30)

Unlike [Proterozoic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proterozoic "Proterozoic") rocks, Archean rocks are distinguished by the presence of heavily metamorphosed deep-water sediments, such as [graywackes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graywacke "Graywacke"), [mudstones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mudstone "Mudstone"), volcanic sediments and [banded iron formations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banded_iron_formation "Banded iron formation"). [Greenstone belts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenstone_belt "Greenstone belt") are typical Archean formations, consisting of alternating high- and low-grade metamorphic rocks. The high-grade rocks were derived from volcanic [island arcs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island_arc "Island arc"), while the low-grade metamorphic rocks represent deep-sea sediments eroded from the neighboring island rocks and deposited in a [forearc basin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forearc "Forearc"). In short, greenstone belts represent sutured protocontinents.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-31)

The [Earth's magnetic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_magnetic_field "Earth's magnetic field") was established 3.5 billion years ago. The [solar wind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_wind "Solar wind") flux was about 100 times the value of the modern [Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun "Sun"), so the presence of the magnetic field helped prevent the planet's atmosphere from being stripped away, which is what probably happened to the [atmosphere of Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Mars "Atmosphere of Mars"). However, the field strength was lower than at present and the [magnetosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetosphere "Magnetosphere") was about half the modern radius.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-32)

The geologic record of the Proterozoic ([2,500 to 538.8](https://geoltime.github.io/?Ma=2500%E2%80%93538.8) million years ago[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-33)) is more complete than that for the preceding [Archean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archean "Archean"). In contrast to the deep-water deposits of the Archean, the Proterozoic features many [strata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratum "Stratum") that were laid down in extensive shallow [epicontinental seas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epeiric_Sea "Epeiric Sea"); furthermore, many of these rocks are less [metamorphosed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamorphic_rock "Metamorphic rock") than Archean-age ones, and plenty are unaltered.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-34) Study of these rocks shows that the eon featured massive, rapid [continental](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continent "Continent") accretion (unique to the Proterozoic), [supercontinent cycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercontinent_cycle "Supercontinent cycle"), and wholly modern [orogenic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orogeny "Orogeny") activity.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-35) Roughly [750](https://geoltime.github.io/?Ma=750)million years ago,[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-ICS2008-36) the earliest-known supercontinent [Rodinia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodinia "Rodinia"), began to break apart. The continents later recombined to form [Pannotia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pannotia "Pannotia"), 600–540 Ma.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-ICS2015-10)[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-37)

The first-known glaciations occurred during the Proterozoic, one that began shortly after the beginning of the eon, while there were at least four during the Neoproterozoic, climaxing with the [Snowball Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowball_Earth "Snowball Earth") of the Varangian glaciation.[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-38)

The **Phanerozoic** Eon is the current eon in the geologic timescale. It covers roughly 539 million years. During this period continents drifted apart, but eventually collected into a single landmass known as [Pangea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangea "Pangea"), before splitting again into the current continental landmasses.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

The Phanerozoic is divided into three eras – the [Paleozoic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleozoic "Paleozoic"), the [Mesozoic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesozoic "Mesozoic") and the [Cenozoic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cenozoic "Cenozoic").

Most of the evolution of multicellular life occurred during this time period.

The **Paleozoic** era spanned roughly [539 to 251](https://geoltime.github.io/?Ma=539%E2%80%93251) million years ago,[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-39) and is subdivided into six [geologic periods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Period_(geology) "Period (geology)"): from oldest to youngest, they are the [Cambrian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambrian "Cambrian"), [Ordovician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordovician "Ordovician"), [Silurian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silurian "Silurian"), [Devonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devonian "Devonian"), [Carboniferous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carboniferous "Carboniferous") and [Permian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permian "Permian"). Geologically, the [Paleozoic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleozoic "Paleozoic") starts shortly after the breakup of a supercontinent called [Pannotia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pannotia "Pannotia") and at the end of a global ice age. Throughout the early Paleozoic, Earth's landmass was broken up into a substantial number of relatively small continents. Toward the end of the era, the continents gathered together into a supercontinent called [Pangaea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangaea "Pangaea"), which included most of Earth's land area.

The **Cambrian** is a major division of the [geologic timescale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geologic_timescale "Geologic timescale") that begins about 538.8 ± 0.2 million years ago.[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-40)[Cambrian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambrian "Cambrian") continents are thought to have resulted from the breakup of a [Neoproterozoic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoproterozoic "Neoproterozoic") supercontinent called Pannotia. The waters of the Cambrian period appear to have been widespread and shallow. Continental drift rates may have been anomalously high. [Laurentia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurentia "Laurentia"), [Baltica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltica "Baltica") and [Siberia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberia "Siberia") remained independent continents following the break-up of the supercontinent of Pannotia. [Gondwana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gondwana "Gondwana") started to drift toward the South Pole. [Panthalassa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panthalassa "Panthalassa") covered most of the southern hemisphere, and minor oceans included the [Proto-Tethys Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Tethys_Ocean "Proto-Tethys Ocean"), [Iapetus Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iapetus_Ocean "Iapetus Ocean") and [Khanty Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khanty_Ocean "Khanty Ocean").

The **Ordovician** period started at a major extinction event called the [Cambrian–Ordovician extinction event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambrian%E2%80%93Ordovician_extinction_event "Cambrian–Ordovician extinction event") some time about 485.4 ± 1.9 million years ago.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-ICS2015-10) During the [Ordovician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordovician "Ordovician") the southern continents were collected into a single continent called Gondwana. Gondwana started the period in the equatorial latitudes and, as the period progressed, drifted toward the South Pole. Early in the Ordovician the continents Laurentia, Siberia and Baltica were still independent continents (since the break-up of the supercontinent Pannotia earlier), but [Baltica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltica "Baltica") began to move toward Laurentia later in the period, causing the Iapetus Ocean to shrink between them. Also, [Avalonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avalonia "Avalonia") broke free from Gondwana and began to head north toward Laurentia. The [Rheic Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheic_Ocean "Rheic Ocean") was formed as a result of this. By the end of the period, Gondwana had neared or approached the pole and was largely glaciated.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

The Ordovician came to a close in a series of [extinction events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction_event "Extinction event") that, taken together, comprise the second-largest of the five major extinction events in [Earth's history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Earth "History of Earth") in terms of percentage of [genera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus "Genus") that became extinct. The only larger one was the Permian-Triassic extinction event. The extinctions occurred approximately [447 to 444](https://geoltime.github.io/?Ma=447%E2%80%93444) million years ago[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-ICS2015-10) and mark the boundary between the Ordovician and the following [Silurian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silurian "Silurian") Period.

The most-commonly accepted theory is that these events were triggered by the onset of an [ice age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_age "Ice age"), in the Hirnantian faunal stage that ended the long, stable [greenhouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse "Greenhouse") conditions typical of the Ordovician. The ice age was probably not as long-lasting as once thought; study of oxygen [isotopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope "Isotope") in fossil brachiopods shows that it was probably no longer than 0.5 to 1.5 million years.[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-41) The event was preceded by a fall in atmospheric carbon dioxide (from 7000ppm to 4400ppm) which selectively affected the shallow seas where most organisms lived. As the southern supercontinent [Gondwana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gondwana "Gondwana") drifted over the South Pole, ice caps formed on it. Evidence of these ice caps has been detected in Upper Ordovician rock strata of North Africa and then-adjacent northeastern South America, which were south-polar locations at the time.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

The **Silurian** is a major division of the [geologic timescale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geologic_timescale "Geologic timescale") that started about 443.8 ± 1.5 million years ago.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-ICS2015-10) During the [Silurian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silurian "Silurian"), Gondwana continued a slow southward drift to high southern latitudes, but there is evidence that the Silurian ice caps were less extensive than those of the late Ordovician glaciation. The melting of ice caps and glaciers contributed to a rise in [sea levels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_level "Sea level"), recognizable from the fact that Silurian sediments overlie eroded Ordovician sediments, forming an [unconformity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconformity "Unconformity"). Other [cratons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craton "Craton") and continent fragments drifted together near the equator, starting the formation of a second supercontinent known as [Euramerica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euramerica "Euramerica"). The vast ocean of Panthalassa covered most of the northern hemisphere. Other minor oceans include Proto-Tethys, Paleo-Tethys, Rheic Ocean, a seaway of Iapetus Ocean (now in between Avalonia and Laurentia), and newly formed [Ural Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ural_Ocean "Ural Ocean").

The **Devonian** spanned roughly from 419 to 359 million years ago.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-ICS2015-10) The period was a time of great tectonic activity, as [Laurasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurasia "Laurasia") and Gondwana drew closer together. The continent Euramerica (or Laurussia) was created in the early Devonian by the collision of Laurentia and Baltica, which rotated into the natural dry zone along the [Tropic of Capricorn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropic_of_Capricorn "Tropic of Capricorn"). In these near-deserts, the [Old Red Sandstone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Red_Sandstone "Old Red Sandstone") sedimentary beds formed, made red by the oxidized iron ([hematite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematite "Hematite")) characteristic of drought conditions. Near the equator Pangaea began to consolidate from the plates containing North America and Europe, further raising the northern [Appalachian Mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appalachian_Mountains "Appalachian Mountains") and forming the [Caledonian Mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caledonian_Mountains "Caledonian Mountains") in [Great Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain "Great Britain") and [Scandinavia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandinavia "Scandinavia"). The southern continents remained tied together in the supercontinent of [Gondwana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gondwana "Gondwana"). The remainder of modern Eurasia lay in the Northern Hemisphere. Sea levels were high worldwide, and much of the land lay submerged under shallow seas. The deep, enormous Panthalassa (the "universal ocean") covered the rest of the planet. Other minor oceans were Paleo-Tethys, Proto-Tethys, Rheic Ocean and Ural Ocean (which was closed during the collision with Siberia and Baltica).

#### Carboniferous Period

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Geological_history_of_Earth&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Carboniferous Period")]

The **Carboniferous** extends from about 358.9 ± 0.4 to about 298.9 ± 0.15 million years ago.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-ICS2015-10)

A global drop in sea level at the end of the Devonian reversed early in the [Carboniferous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carboniferous "Carboniferous"); this created the widespread epicontinental seas and carbonate deposition of the [Mississippian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippian_age "Mississippian age"). There was also a drop in south polar temperatures; southern Gondwana was glaciated throughout the period, though it is uncertain if the ice sheets were a holdover from the Devonian or not. These conditions apparently had little effect in the deep tropics, where lush [coal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal "Coal") swamps flourished within 30 degrees of the northernmost glaciers. A mid-Carboniferous drop in sea-level precipitated a major marine extinction, one that hit [crinoids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crinoid "Crinoid") and [ammonites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonite "Ammonite") especially hard. This sea-level drop and the associated unconformity in North America separate the [Mississippian period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippian_(geology) "Mississippian (geology)") from the [Pennsylvanian period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvanian_period "Pennsylvanian period").[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-Stanley,_414-42)

The Carboniferous was a time of active mountain building, as the supercontinent Pangea came together. The southern continents remained tied together in the supercontinent Gondwana, which collided with North America-Europe ([Laurussia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurussia "Laurussia")) along the present line of eastern [North America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America "North America"). This continental collision resulted in the [Hercynian orogeny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hercynian_orogeny "Hercynian orogeny") in Europe, and the [Alleghenian orogeny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alleghenian_orogeny "Alleghenian orogeny") in North America; it also extended the newly uplifted Appalachians southwestward as the [Ouachita Mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouachita_Mountains "Ouachita Mountains").[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-43) In the same time frame, much of present eastern [Eurasian Plate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_Plate "Eurasian Plate") welded itself to Europe along the line of the [Ural Mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ural_Mountains "Ural Mountains"). There were two major oceans in the Carboniferous: the Panthalassa and Paleo-Tethys. Other minor oceans were shrinking and eventually closed the [Rheic Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheic_Ocean "Rheic Ocean") (closed by the assembly of South and North America), the small, shallow [Ural Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ural_Ocean "Ural Ocean") (which was closed by the collision of [Baltica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltica "Baltica"), and [Siberia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberia_(continent) "Siberia (continent)") continents, creating the Ural Mountains) and Proto-Tethys Ocean.

Pangaea separation animation

The **Permian** extends from about 298.9 ± 0.15 to 252.17 ± 0.06 million years ago.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-ICS2015-10)

During the [Permian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permian "Permian") all Earth's major landmasses, except portions of East Asia, were collected into a single supercontinent known as [Pangaea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangaea "Pangaea"). Pangaea straddled the equator and extended toward the poles, with a corresponding effect on ocean currents in the single great ocean (_[Panthalassa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panthalassa "Panthalassa")_, the _universal sea_), and the [Paleo-Tethys Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleo-Tethys_Ocean "Paleo-Tethys Ocean"), a large ocean that was between Asia and Gondwana. The Cimmeria continent rifted away from Gondwana and drifted north to Laurasia, causing the Paleo-Tethys to shrink. A new ocean was growing on its southern end, the Tethys Ocean, an ocean that would dominate much of the Mesozoic Era. Large continental landmasses create climates with extreme variations of heat and cold ("continental climate") and monsoon conditions with highly seasonal rainfall patterns. [Deserts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert "Desert") seem to have been widespread on Pangaea.

Plate tectonics - [290](https://geoltime.github.io/?Ma=290)million years ago

The **Mesozoic** extended roughly from [252 to 66](https://geoltime.github.io/?Ma=252%E2%80%9366) million years ago.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-ICS2015-10)

After the vigorous convergent plate mountain-building of the late [Paleozoic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleozoic "Paleozoic"), [Mesozoic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesozoic "Mesozoic") tectonic deformation was comparatively mild. Nevertheless, the era featured the dramatic rifting of the supercontinent [Pangaea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangaea "Pangaea"). Pangaea gradually split into a northern continent, [Laurasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurasia "Laurasia"), and a southern continent, [Gondwana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gondwana "Gondwana"). This created the [passive continental margin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_continental_margin "Passive continental margin") that characterizes most of the [Atlantic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic "Atlantic") coastline (such as along the U.S. East Coast) today.

The **Triassic** Period extends from about 252.17 ± 0.06 to 201.3 ± 0.2 million years ago.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-ICS2015-10) During the [Triassic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triassic "Triassic"), almost all Earth's landmass was concentrated into a single [supercontinent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercontinent "Supercontinent") centered more or less on the equator, called [Pangaea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangaea "Pangaea") ("all the land"). This took the form of a giant "[Pac-Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man "Pac-Man")" with an east-facing "mouth" constituting the [Tethys sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tethys_Ocean "Tethys Ocean"), a vast gulf that opened farther westward in the mid-Triassic, at the expense of the shrinking [Paleo-Tethys Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleo-Tethys_Ocean "Paleo-Tethys Ocean"), an ocean that existed during the [Paleozoic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleozoic "Paleozoic").

The remainder was the world-ocean known as [Panthalassa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panthalassa "Panthalassa") ("all the sea"). All the deep-ocean sediments laid down during the Triassic have disappeared through [subduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subduction "Subduction") of oceanic plates; thus, very little is known of the Triassic open ocean. The supercontinent Pangaea was rifting during the Triassic—especially late in the period—but had not yet separated. The first nonmarine sediments in the [rift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rift "Rift") that marks the initial break-up of Pangea—which separated [New Jersey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey "New Jersey") from [Morocco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco "Morocco")—are of Late Triassic age; in the U.S., these thick sediments comprise the [Newark Supergroup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newark_Supergroup "Newark Supergroup").[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-lasdtri-44) Because of the limited shoreline of one super-continental mass, Triassic marine deposits are globally relatively rare; despite their prominence in [Western Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Europe "Western Europe"), where the Triassic was first studied. In [North America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America "North America"), for example, marine deposits are limited to a few exposures in the west. Thus Triassic [stratigraphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratigraphy "Stratigraphy") is mostly based on organisms living in lagoons and hypersaline environments, such as _Estheria_ crustaceans and terrestrial vertebrates.[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-45)

The **Jurassic** Period extends from about 201.3 ± 0.2 to 145.0 million years ago.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-ICS2015-10) During the early [Jurassic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic "Jurassic"), the supercontinent [Pangaea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangaea "Pangaea") broke up into the northern supercontinent [Laurasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurasia "Laurasia") and the southern supercontinent [Gondwana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gondwana "Gondwana"); the [Gulf of Mexico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico "Gulf of Mexico") opened in the new rift between North America and what is now [Mexico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico "Mexico")'s [Yucatan Peninsula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucatan_Peninsula "Yucatan Peninsula"). The Jurassic North [Atlantic Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean "Atlantic Ocean") was relatively narrow, while the South Atlantic did not open until the following Cretaceous Period, when Gondwana itself rifted apart.[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-panjur2-46) The [Tethys Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tethys_Ocean "Tethys Ocean") closed, and the [Neotethys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Basin "Mediterranean Basin") basin appeared. Climates were warm, with no evidence of [glaciation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glacier "Glacier"). As in the Triassic, there was apparently no land near either pole, and no extensive ice caps existed. The Jurassic geological record is good in western [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe "Europe"), where extensive marine sequences indicate a time when much of the continent was submerged under shallow tropical seas; famous locales include the [Jurassic Coast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_Coast "Jurassic Coast")[World Heritage Site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage_Site "World Heritage Site") and the renowned late Jurassic _[lagerstätten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagerst%C3%A4tte "Lagerstätte")_ of [Holzmaden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holzmaden "Holzmaden") and [Solnhofen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solnhofen_limestone "Solnhofen limestone").[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-lasdjur-47) In contrast, the North American Jurassic record is the poorest of the Mesozoic, with few outcrops at the surface.[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-48) Though the [epicontinental](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epeiric_Sea "Epeiric Sea")[Sundance Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundance_Sea "Sundance Sea") left marine deposits in parts of the northern plains of the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States") and [Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada "Canada") during the late Jurassic, most exposed sediments from this period are continental, such as the [alluvial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alluvium "Alluvium") deposits of the [Morrison Formation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morrison_Formation "Morrison Formation"). The first of several massive [batholiths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batholith "Batholith") were emplaced in the northern [Cordillera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_cordillera "American cordillera") beginning in the mid-Jurassic, marking the [Nevadan orogeny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevadan_orogeny "Nevadan orogeny").[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-49) Important Jurassic exposures are also found in Russia, India, South America, Japan, [Australasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australasia "Australasia") and the United Kingdom.

Plate tectonics - 100 Ma,[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-ICS2015-10)[Cretaceous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous "Cretaceous") period

The **Cretaceous** Period extends from circa [145](https://geoltime.github.io/?Ma=145.0)million years ago to [66](https://geoltime.github.io/?Ma=66)million years ago.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-ICS2015-10)

During the [Cretaceous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous "Cretaceous"), the late [Paleozoic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleozoic "Paleozoic")-early Mesozoic [supercontinent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercontinent "Supercontinent") of [Pangaea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangaea "Pangaea") completed its breakup into present day [continents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continent "Continent"), although their positions were substantially different at the time. As the [Atlantic Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean "Atlantic Ocean") widened, the convergent-margin [orogenies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orogeny "Orogeny") that had begun during the Jurassic continued in the [North American Cordillera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_cordillera "American cordillera"), as the [Nevadan orogeny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevadan_orogeny "Nevadan orogeny") was followed by the [Sevier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sevier_orogeny "Sevier orogeny") and [Laramide orogenies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laramide_orogeny "Laramide orogeny"). Though Gondwana was still intact in the beginning of the Cretaceous, [Gondwana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gondwana "Gondwana") itself broke up as [South America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America "South America"), [Antarctica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctica "Antarctica") and [Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia "Australia") rifted away from [Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa "Africa") (though [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India "India") and [Madagascar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madagascar "Madagascar") remained attached to each other); thus, the South Atlantic and [Indian Oceans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean "Indian Ocean") were newly formed. Such active rifting lifted great undersea mountain chains along the welts, raising [eustatic sea levels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_level "Sea level") worldwide.

To the north of Africa the [Tethys Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tethys_Sea "Tethys Sea") continued to narrow. Broad shallow seas advanced across central [North America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America "North America") (the [Western Interior Seaway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Interior_Seaway "Western Interior Seaway")) and Europe, then receded late in the period, leaving thick marine deposits sandwiched between [coal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal "Coal") beds. At the peak of the Cretaceous [transgression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgression_(geology) "Transgression (geology)"), one-third of Earth's present land area was submerged.[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-50) The Cretaceous is justly famous for its [chalk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chalk "Chalk"); indeed, more chalk formed in the Cretaceous than in any other period in the [Phanerozoic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phanerozoic "Phanerozoic").[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-51)[Mid-ocean ridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-ocean_ridge "Mid-ocean ridge") activity—or rather, the circulation of seawater through the enlarged ridges—enriched the oceans in calcium; this made the oceans more saturated, as well as increased the bioavailability of the element for [calcareous nanoplankton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coccolithophores "Coccolithophores").[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-52) These widespread [carbonates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonate "Carbonate") and other [sedimentary deposits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedimentary_rock "Sedimentary rock") make the Cretaceous rock record especially fine. Famous [formations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geologic_formation "Geologic formation") from North America include the rich marine fossils of [Kansas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas "Kansas")'s [Smoky Hill Chalk Member](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoky_Hill_Chalk "Smoky Hill Chalk") and the terrestrial fauna of the late Cretaceous [Hell Creek Formation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell_Creek_Formation "Hell Creek Formation"). Other important Cretaceous exposures occur in [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe "Europe") and [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China "China"). In the area that is now India, massive [lava](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lava "Lava") beds called the [Deccan Traps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deccan_Traps "Deccan Traps") were laid down in the very late Cretaceous and early Paleocene.

The **Cenozoic** Era covers the 66 million years since the [Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous%E2%80%93Paleogene_extinction_event "Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event") up to and including the present day. By the end of the [Mesozoic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesozoic "Mesozoic") era, the continents had rifted into nearly their present form. [Laurasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurasia "Laurasia") became [North America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America "North America") and [Eurasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasia "Eurasia"), while [Gondwana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gondwana "Gondwana") split into [South America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America "South America"), [Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa "Africa"), [Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia "Australia"), [Antarctica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctica "Antarctica") and the [Indian subcontinent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_subcontinent "Indian subcontinent"), which collided with the Asian plate. This impact gave rise to the Himalayas. The Tethys Sea, which had separated the northern continents from Africa and India, began to close up, forming the [Mediterranean Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea "Mediterranean Sea").

The **Paleogene** (alternatively **Palaeogene**) [Period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geologic_period "Geologic period") is a unit of [geologic time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geologic_time "Geologic time") that began 66 and ended 23.03 Ma[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-ICS2015-10) and comprises the first part of the [Cenozoic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cenozoic "Cenozoic") Era. This period consists of the [Paleocene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleocene "Paleocene"), [Eocene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eocene "Eocene") and [Oligocene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligocene "Oligocene") Epochs.

The **Paleocene**, lasted from [66](https://geoltime.github.io/?Ma=66)million years ago to [56](https://geoltime.github.io/?Ma=56.0)million years ago.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-ICS2015-10)

In many ways, the [Paleocene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleocene "Paleocene") continued processes that had begun during the late Cretaceous Period. During the Paleocene, the [continents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continent "Continent") continued to drift toward their present positions. Supercontinent [Laurasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurasia "Laurasia") had not yet separated into three continents. [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe "Europe") and [Greenland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenland "Greenland") were still connected. [North America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America "North America") and [Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia "Asia") were still intermittently joined by a land bridge, while Greenland and North America were beginning to separate.[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-Hooker-53) The [Laramide orogeny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laramide_orogeny "Laramide orogeny") of the late Cretaceous continued to uplift the [Rocky Mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Mountains "Rocky Mountains") in the American west, which ended in the succeeding epoch. South and North America remained separated by equatorial seas (they joined during the [Neogene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neogene "Neogene")); the components of the former southern supercontinent [Gondwana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gondwana "Gondwana") continued to split apart, with [Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa "Africa"), South America, [Antarctica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctica "Antarctica") and [Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia "Australia") pulling away from each other. Africa was heading north toward [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe "Europe"), slowly closing the [Tethys Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tethys_Ocean "Tethys Ocean"), and [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India "India") began its migration to Asia that would lead to a tectonic collision and the formation of the [Himalayas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himalayas "Himalayas").

During the **[Eocene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eocene "Eocene")** ([56](https://geoltime.github.io/?Ma=56.0)million years ago - [33.9](https://geoltime.github.io/?Ma=33.9)million years ago),[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-ICS2015-10) the continents continued to drift toward their present positions. At the beginning of the period, Australia and Antarctica remained connected, and warm [equatorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equator "Equator") currents mixed with colder Antarctic waters, distributing the heat around the world and keeping global temperatures high. But when Australia split from the southern continent around 45 [Ma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annum "Annum"), the warm equatorial currents were deflected away from Antarctica, and an isolated cold water channel developed between the two continents. The Antarctic region cooled down, and the ocean surrounding Antarctica began to freeze, sending cold water and ice floes north, reinforcing the cooling. The present pattern of [ice ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_age "Ice age") began about [40](https://geoltime.github.io/?Ma=40)million years ago.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-54)

The northern [supercontinent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercontinent "Supercontinent") of [Laurasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurasia "Laurasia") began to break up, as [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe "Europe"), [Greenland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenland "Greenland") and [North America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America "North America") drifted apart. In western North America, [mountain building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orogeny "Orogeny") started in the Eocene, and huge lakes formed in the high flat basins among uplifts. In Europe, the [Tethys Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tethys_Sea "Tethys Sea") finally vanished, while the uplift of the [Alps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alps "Alps") isolated its final remnant, the [Mediterranean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea "Mediterranean Sea"), and created another shallow sea with island [archipelagos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archipelago "Archipelago") to the north. Though the North [Atlantic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean "Atlantic Ocean") was opening, a land connection appears to have remained between North America and Europe since the faunas of the two regions are very similar. [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India "India") continued its journey away from [Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa "Africa") and began its collision with [Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia "Asia"), creating the [Himalayan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himalaya "Himalaya") orogeny.

The **Oligocene** Epoch extends from about [34](https://geoltime.github.io/?Ma=34)million years ago to [23](https://geoltime.github.io/?Ma=23)million years ago.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-ICS2015-10) During the [Oligocene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligocene "Oligocene") the continents continued to drift toward their present positions.

[Antarctica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctica "Antarctica") continued to become more isolated and finally developed a permanent [ice cap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_cap "Ice cap"). [Mountain building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orogeny "Orogeny") in western [North America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America "North America") continued, and the [Alps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alps "Alps") started to rise in [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe "Europe") as the [African Plate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Plate "African Plate") continued to push north into the [Eurasian Plate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_Plate "Eurasian Plate"), isolating the remnants of [Tethys Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tethys_Sea "Tethys Sea"). A brief marine incursion marks the early Oligocene in Europe. There appears to have been a land bridge in the early Oligocene between [North America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America "North America") and [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe "Europe") since the [faunas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fauna_(animals) "Fauna (animals)") of the two regions are very similar. During the Oligocene, [South America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America "South America") was finally detached from [Antarctica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctica "Antarctica") and drifted north toward [North America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America "North America"). It also allowed the [Antarctic Circumpolar Current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctic_Circumpolar_Current "Antarctic Circumpolar Current") to flow, rapidly cooling the continent.

The **Neogene** Period is a unit of [geologic time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geologic_timescale "Geologic timescale") starting 23.03 Ma.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-ICS2015-10) and ends at 2.588 Ma. The Neogene Period follows the [Paleogene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleogene "Paleogene") Period. The Neogene consists of the [Miocene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miocene "Miocene") and [Pliocene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pliocene "Pliocene") and is followed by the [Quaternary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternary "Quaternary") Period.

The **Miocene** extends from about 23.03 to 5.333 million years ago.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-ICS2015-10)

During the [Miocene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miocene "Miocene") continents continued to drift toward their present positions. Of the modern geologic features, only the land bridge between [South America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America "South America") and [North America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America "North America") was absent, the subduction zone along the [Pacific Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean "Pacific Ocean") margin of South America caused the rise of the [Andes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andes "Andes") and the southward extension of the [Meso-American](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meso-American "Meso-American") peninsula. [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India "India") continued to collide with [Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia "Asia"). The Tethys Seaway continued to shrink and then disappeared as [Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa "Africa") collided with [Eurasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasia "Eurasia") in the [Turkish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey "Turkey")-[Arabian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabia "Arabia") region between 19 and 12 [Ma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annum "Annum") ([ICS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Commission_on_Stratigraphy "International Commission on Stratigraphy") 2004). Subsequent uplift of mountains in the western [Mediterranean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean "Mediterranean") region and a global fall in sea levels combined to cause a temporary drying up of the Mediterranean Sea resulting in the [Messinian salinity crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messinian_salinity_crisis "Messinian salinity crisis") near the end of the Miocene.

The **Pliocene** extends from [5.333](https://geoltime.github.io/?Ma=5.333)million years ago to [2.588](https://geoltime.github.io/?Ma=2.588)million years ago.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-ICS2015-10) During the [Pliocene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pliocene "Pliocene") continents continued to drift toward their present positions, moving from positions possibly as far as 250 kilometres (155 mi) from their present locations to positions only 70 km from their current locations.

South America became linked to North America through the [Isthmus of Panama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isthmus_of_Panama "Isthmus of Panama") during the Pliocene, bringing a nearly complete end to South America's distinctive [marsupial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsupialia "Marsupialia") faunas. The formation of the Isthmus had major consequences on global temperatures, since warm equatorial ocean currents were cut off and an Atlantic cooling cycle began, with cold Arctic and Antarctic waters dropping temperatures in the now-isolated Atlantic Ocean. [Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa "Africa")'s collision with [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe "Europe") formed the [Mediterranean Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea "Mediterranean Sea"), cutting off the remnants of the [Tethys Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tethys_Ocean "Tethys Ocean"). Sea level changes exposed the land-bridge between [Alaska](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska "Alaska") and Asia. Near the end of the Pliocene, about [2.58](https://geoltime.github.io/?Ma=2.58)million years ago (the start of the Quaternary Period), the [current ice age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternary_glaciation "Quaternary glaciation") began. The polar regions have since undergone repeated cycles of glaciation and thaw, repeating every 40,000–100,000 years.

The **Pleistocene** extends from [2.588](https://geoltime.github.io/?Ma=2.588)million years ago to 11,700 years before present.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-ICS2015-10) The modern [continents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continent "Continent") were essentially at their present positions during the [Pleistocene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleistocene "Pleistocene"), the [plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tectonic_plate "Tectonic plate") upon which they sit probably having moved no more than 100 kilometres (62 mi) relative to each other since the beginning of the period.

[![Image 10](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/Earth_dry_elevation.stl/250px-Earth_dry_elevation.stl.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Earth_dry_elevation.stl)

Current Earth - without water, elevation greatly exaggerated (click/enlarge to "spin" 3D-globe).

The **Holocene** Epoch began approximately 11,700 calendar years before present[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-ICS2015-10) and continues to the present. During the [Holocene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene "Holocene"), continental motions have been less than a kilometer.

The [last glacial period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_glacial_period "Last glacial period") of the [current ice age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternary_ice_age "Quaternary ice age") ended about 10,000 years ago.[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth#cite_note-55) Ice melt caused world [sea levels to rise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_level_rise "Sea level rise") about 35 metres (115 ft) in the early part of the Holocene. In addition, many areas above about [40 degrees north](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/40th_parallel_north "40th parallel north") latitude had been depressed by the weight of the Pleistocene [glaciers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glacier "Glacier") and rose as much as 180 metres (591 ft) over the late Pleistocene and Holocene, and are still rising today. The sea level rise and temporary land depression allowed temporary marine incursions into areas that are now far from the sea. Holocene marine fossils are known from [Vermont](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermont "Vermont"), [Quebec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec "Quebec"), [Ontario](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario "Ontario") and [Michigan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan "Michigan"). Other than higher latitude temporary marine incursions associated with glacial depression, Holocene fossils are found primarily in lakebed, floodplain and cave deposits. Holocene marine deposits along low-latitude coastlines are rare because the rise in sea levels during the period exceeds any likely upthrusting of non-glacial origin. [Post-glacial rebound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-glacial_rebound "Post-glacial rebound") in [Scandinavia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandinavia "Scandinavia") resulted in the emergence of coastal areas around the [Baltic Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltic_Sea "Baltic Sea"), including much of [Finland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland "Finland"). The region continues to rise, still causing weak [earthquakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake "Earthquake") across [Northern Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Europe "Northern Europe"). The equivalent event in North America was the rebound of [Hudson Bay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_Bay "Hudson Bay"), as it shrank from its larger, immediate post-glacial [Tyrrell Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrrell_Sea "Tyrrell Sea") phase, to near its present boundaries.
