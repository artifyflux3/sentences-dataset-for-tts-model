Find sources: "Geodesic circle" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( May 2024 ) A geodesic circle is either "the locus on a surface at a constant geodesic distance from a fixed point " or a curve of constant geodesic curvature .

[ 1 ] A geodesic disk is the region on a surface bounded by a geodesic circle.
In contrast with the ordinary circle and disk , the geodesic circle is not necessarily a plane curve and the geodesic disk is not necessarily a planar surface .
They can be used to define Gaussian curvature .
