The Patriots compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the American Football Conference (AFC) East division. The Patriots play home games at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts , which is 22 miles (35 km) [ 13 ] [ 14 ] southwest of Boston , Massachusetts. The franchise is owned by Robert Kraft , who purchased the team in 1994.

[ 15 ] [ 16 ] As of 2024, the Patriots are the sixth-most valuable sports team in the world [ 17 ] and have sold out every home game since 1994.

[ 18 ] Founded in 1959 as the Boston Patriots , the team was a charter member of the American Football League (AFL) before joining the NFL in 1970 through the AFL–NFL merger . The Patriots played their home games at various stadiums throughout Boston, including Fenway Park from 1963 to 1969 [ 19 ] until the franchise moved to Foxborough in 1971. As part of the move, the team changed its name to the New England Patriots. Home games were played at Foxboro Stadium until 2002 when the stadium was demolished alongside the opening of Gillette Stadium. The team began utilizing Gillette Stadium for home games the same year.

Generally mediocre until coming under the ownership of Robert Kraft , the Patriots experienced unexpected success in the 2001 season under head coach Bill Belichick and quarterback Tom Brady , which started a period of dominance which lasted until the 2019 season.

[ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ] The Brady–Belichick era , regarded as one of the greatest sports dynasties , would see the Patriots claim nearly every major Super Bowl record .

[ 28 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] [ 26 ] [ 32 ] The Patriots hold the records for most Super Bowl wins (6, tied with the Pittsburgh Steelers ), appearances (11), and losses (5, tied with the Denver Broncos ). Other NFL records held by the franchise include the most wins in a 10-year period (126 from 2003 to 2012), the longest winning streak of regular season and playoff games (21 from October 2003 to October 2004), the most consecutive winning seasons (19 from 2001 to 2019), the most consecutive conference championship appearances (8 from 2011 to 2018), the most consecutive division titles (11 from 2009 to 2019), the only undefeated 16-game regular season (2007), and the highest postseason winning percentage (.638).

History Main article: History of the New England Patriots See also: Brady–Belichick era Billy Sullivan , a Massachusetts native, brought professional football back to the state after nearly 11 years by founding the Patriots in 1959. His 27-year ownership was controversial.

The Patriots are named after the colonists who rebelled against British control during the Revolutionary War , which was locally relevant due to the colony of Massachusetts playing a pivotal role in American independence. (Image: Minute Man statue in Concord, Massachusetts ) On November 16, 1959, Boston business executive Billy Sullivan was awarded the eighth and final franchise of the developing American Football League (AFL).

[ 33 ] The following winter, locals were allowed to submit ideas for the Boston football team's official name.

[ 34 ] The most popular choice – and the one that Sullivan selected – was the "Boston Patriots", [ 35 ] [ 36 ] with " Patriots " referring to the colonists of the Thirteen Colonies who rebelled against British control during the American Revolution and in July 1776 declared the United States of America an independent nation, which heavily involved the then– colony of Massachusetts . Immediately thereafter, artist Phil Bissell of The Boston Globe developed the " Pat Patriot " logo.

[ 37 ] The Patriots never had a regular home stadium in the AFL.

Boston University Field , Harvard Stadium , Fenway Park (shared with baseball's Boston Red Sox ), and Boston College 's Alumni Stadium all served as home fields during their time in the American Football League. The 1963 season saw the franchise's first playoff win over Buffalo to clinch the division. They subsequently lost the AFL championship game to the San Diego Chargers 51–10 . They did not appear again in an AFL or NFL post-season game for another 13 years.

[ 38 ] When the NFL and AFL merged in 1970 , the Patriots were placed in the American Football Conference (AFC) East division, where they still play.

[ 38 ] The following year, the Patriots moved to a new stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts , their home for the next 30 years, and changed their name from the Boston Patriots to the Bay State Patriots , after the state of Massachusetts .

[ 39 ] The name was rejected by the NFL and on March 22, 1971, the team officially announced they would change its geographic name to New England .

[ 38 ] During the 1970s, the Patriots had some success under head coach Chuck Fairbanks , earning a berth to the playoffs in 1976 – as a wild card team – and in 1978 – as AFC East champions. They lost in the first round both times.

[ 40 ] [ 41 ] Under his successor, Ron Erhardt , the team finished one game out of the playoffs his first two years.

The next coach, Ron Meyer , led the team to the playoffs in the strike-shortened 1982 season, and despite not having a losing record during his career, he was fired in 1984 due to poor relationships with players and management. Hall-of-Fame player Raymond Berry was hired as his replacement, and in 1985 , he brought the team to its first AFC Championship and a berth in Super Bowl XX , which they lost to the Chicago Bears 46–10. After their Super Bowl loss, they returned to the playoffs in 1986 but lost in the first round. Berry left the team after a disappointing 1989 season, and his replacement Rod Rust only lasted one season, 1990, during which the Patriots went 1–15.

During the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Patriots changed ownership several times, being purchased from the Sullivan family first by Victor Kiam in 1988, who sold the team to James Orthwein in 1992. Though Orthwein's period as owner was short and controversial, he did oversee major changes to the team, first with the hiring of former New York Giants coach Bill Parcells in 1993. Orthwein and his marketing team then defied Patriots fans' overwhelming preference and commissioned the NFL to develop a new visual identity and logo, and changed their primary colors from the traditional red, white and blue to blue and silver for the team uniforms.

[ 42 ] Orthwein intended to move the team to his native St. Louis (where it would have been renamed as the St. Louis Stallions ), but instead sold the team in 1994 for $175 million to Boston paper magnate Robert Kraft , who had bought the Patriots' then-home, Foxboro Stadium , out of bankruptcy in 1988.

[ 18 ] Continuing on as head coach under Kraft's ownership, Parcells would bring the Patriots to two playoff appearances, including Super Bowl XXXI (after the 1996 season ), which they lost to the Green Bay Packers by a score of 35–21.

[ 43 ] Pete Carroll , Parcells's successor, would also take the team to the playoffs twice in 1997 and 1998 before being dismissed as head coach after the 1999 season.

[ 44 ] [ 45 ] [ 46 ] Quarterback Tom Brady and head coach Bill Belichick were the pillars of the Patriots dynasty throughout the 2000s and 2010s. During that period (2001–2019), they led the Patriots to nine Super Bowl appearances, winning six. They are widely regarded as the greatest QB-HC tandem of all time.

Tight end Rob Gronkowski , nicknamed "Gronk", is widely regarded as one of the greatest TEs of all time. He was a staple of the 2010s offenses.

In 2000, the Patriots hired head coach Bill Belichick , who had served as defensive coordinator under Parcells including during Super Bowl XXXI.

[ 47 ] Their new home field, Gillette Stadium , opened in 2002 to replace the aging Foxboro Stadium. Long-time starting quarterback Drew Bledsoe , who was the franchise's star throughout the 1990s, went down with a sheared blood vessel in his chest in a week two match-up in 2001 against the rival New York Jets . Backup quarterback Tom Brady , drafted by the Patriots in sixth round of the 2000 NFL draft , became the starting quarterback. Brady's successful play led to Bledsoe never getting his job back as a starter, and would serve as the franchise's starting quarterback for the next 18 years.

[ 48 ] Under Belichick and Brady, the Patriots became one of the most consistently dominant teams in the NFL, with many describing the team as a " dynasty ". Within the first few seasons of the 21st century, the team won three Super Bowls in four seasons ( 2001 , 2003 , and 2004 ), over the St. Louis Rams , Carolina Panthers , and Philadelphia Eagles , respectively.

[ 49 ] In the 2005 season, the Patriots went 10–6 and won the division.

[ 50 ] The Patriots defeated the Jacksonville Jaguars in the Wild Card Round before falling to the Denver Broncos in the Divisional Round.

[ 53 ] After defeating the Jets and the Chargers, the Patriots lost in the AFC Championship to the Colts.

[ 54 ] [ 55 ] [ 56 ] The Patriots finished the 2007 regular season with a perfect 16–0 record, becoming only the fourth team in league history to go undefeated in the regular season, and the only one since the league expanded its regular season schedule to 16 games.

[ 57 ] After advancing to Super Bowl XLII , the team's fourth Super Bowl in seven years, the Patriots were upset by the Giants to end their bid for a 19–0 season.

[ 58 ] With the loss, the Patriots ended the year at 18–1, becoming only one of three teams to go 18–1 along with the 1984 San Francisco 49ers and the 1985 Chicago Bears . However, both the Bears and 49ers lost their only game during the regular season, and both would win their respective Super Bowl.

[ 59 ] In the first game of the 2008 season, Brady suffered a torn ACL against the Chiefs.

[ 60 ] Matt Cassell stepped in for the rest of the season and the team finished 11–5 but missed the postseason.

[ 61 ] In the 2009 season, Brady returned from his injury and led the team to a 10–6 record and a division title.

[ 62 ] The team's season in the Wild Card Round with a 33–14 loss to the Baltimore Ravens.

[ 63 ] The Patriots went 14–2 and won the division in the 2010 season but were one-and-done in the Divisional Round of the playoffs against the New York Jets in a 28–21 loss.

[ 64 ] [ 65 ] The Patriots returned to the Super Bowl in 2011 but lost again to the Giants , 21–17.

[ 66 ] In the 2012 season, the Patriots won the AFC East with a 12–4 record.

[ 67 ] The team defeated the Houston Texans in the Divisional Round before falling to the Baltimore Ravens in the AFC Championship.

[ 68 ] [ 69 ] In the 2013 season, the Patriots went 12–4 and won the division.

[ 70 ] The Patriots defeated the Indianapolis Colts 43–22 in the Divisional Round before falling to the Denver Broncos 26–16 in the AFC Championship.

[ 71 ] [ 72 ] In 2014, the Patriots won the division with a 12–4 record.

[ 73 ] The Patriots defeated the Baltimore Ravens in the Divisional Round and the Indianapolis Colts in the AFC Championship.

[ 74 ] [ 75 ] The Patriots reached a record-tying eighth Super Bowl, where they defeated the defending champion Seattle Seahawks by a score of 28–24 to win Super Bowl XLIX for their fourth title.

[ 76 ] After Seattle had driven the ball to New England's 1-yard line with under a minute to go, New England rookie cornerback Malcolm Butler made a critical interception on Seattle's final offensive play that helped to seal the victory.

[ 77 ] In the 2015 season, the Patriots won the division with a 12–4 record.

[ 78 ] The team defeated the Kansas City Chiefs in the Divisional Round before falling to the Denver Broncos in the AFC Championship.

[ 79 ] [ 80 ] Tom Brady is seen celebrating the team's dramatic comeback victory over the Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl LI New England became the first team to reach nine Super Bowls in the 2016–17 playoffs and faced the Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl LI .

[ 81 ] Trailing 28–3 midway through the third quarter, the Patriots scored 25 unanswered points to tie the game in the final seconds of regulation. In the first overtime in Super Bowl history, the Patriots won the coin toss and scored a touchdown to claim their fifth Super Bowl victory.

[ 82 ] The Patriots extended their record to ten Super Bowl appearances in the 2017–18 playoffs but lost to the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LII .

[ 83 ] The Patriots returned to the championship game for a third consecutive season in Super Bowl LIII , where they defeated the Los Angeles Rams 13–3 to win their sixth Super Bowl, tying them with the Pittsburgh Steelers for most Super Bowl victories in NFL history.

[ 84 ] [ 85 ] After a disappointing 2019 season, in which the team lost in the first round of the playoffs to the Tennessee Titans, [ 86 ] [ 87 ] and in which the long-time Brady–Belichick partnership was strained due to Brady wanting to have more input in organizational decisions, [ 88 ] Brady departed the Patriots after 20 seasons for free agency, signing with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers .

[ 89 ] To replace him, the Patriots signed veteran quarterback Cam Newton .

[ 90 ] In 2020, the team missed the playoffs with their first losing record, 7–9, in two decades.

[ 91 ] The team drafted Mac Jones in the first round of the 2021 NFL draft , and released Newton after naming Jones the starting quarterback prior to the team's first game of the 2021 season.

[ 92 ] Jones led the team to their first playoff berth without Brady since 1998, but they would lose 47–17 to the division rival Buffalo Bills in the Wild Card round.

[ 93 ] The Patriots finished with a 8–9 record and missed the postseason in the 2022 season.

[ 94 ] After a gloomy 4–13 record in the 2023 season, the Patriots mutually parted ways with Bill Belichick after 24 years on January 11, 2024, notably due to a series of poor decisions in his final years as general manager regarding offensive personnel, which culminated in a sharp decline of offensive production after the 2021 season.

[ 95 ] One day later, the Patriots promoted the pair of Jerod Mayo , then-current linebackers coach and former player, and Eliot Wolf , director of scouting and son of Pro Football Hall of Fame general manager Ron Wolf , as first-time head coach and first-time de facto general manager to each succeed Belichick's duties.

[ 96 ] Mac Jones, after three seasons as the incumbent starter, was traded in the 2024 offseason due to his insufficient play.

[ 97 ] The post-Belichick era was kickstarted during the 2024 NFL draft , with the franchise selecting Drake Maye third overall, the highest draft pick held by the Patriots in 31 years up to that point.

[ 98 ] On the day of the final game of the 2024 season, the Patriots fired Jerod Mayo after repeating the prior year's 4–13 record in his debut campaign as a head coach, due to multiple factors, including limited experience, which was eventually described by Robert Kraft as being put in an "untenable situation".

[ 99 ] [ 100 ] Mike Vrabel was named head coach after Mayo's dismissal.

[ 101 ] Logos and uniforms Primary logos The Patriots' primary logo used in the Sullivan era from 1961 to 1992, known as " Pat Patriot ". Today, it is kept as a secondary logo, complementing the modern logo, the "Flying Elvis" The Patriots' primary logo used since 1993, known as the "Flying Elvis". The only alteration since 1993 was the blue being darkened in 2000 The Patriots' helmet since 2000 (displayed at the Pro Football Hall of Fame ) The Patriots original helmet logo was a simple tricorne hat, used only for the 1960 season. From 1961 to 1992, the Patriots used a logo of a Revolutionary War minuteman hiking a football. The Patriots wordmark logo during this time consisted of a western-style font. The minuteman logo became known as the " Pat Patriot " logo, which later became the name of the team's mascot.

[ 102 ] [ 103 ] In 1979, the Patriots worked with NFL Properties to design a new, streamlined logo, to replace the complex Pat Patriot logo. The new logo featured the blue and white profile of a minuteman in a tricorne hat set against a flag showing three red stripes separated by two white stripes. Team owner Billy Sullivan decided to put the new logo up to a vote against Pat Patriot with the fans at the September 23 home game against the San Diego Chargers , using a sound level meter to judge the crowd's reaction. The new logo was decidedly rejected by the crowd in favor of Pat, and the concept was shelved.

[ 104 ] In 1993, a new logo was unveiled involving the gray face of a minuteman wearing a red, white and royal blue hat that begins as a tricorne and transitions into a flowing banner-like design. It became popularly known as the "Flying Elvis" due to many observing its resemblance to the profile of a young Elvis Presley . A new script logo was introduced as well in tandem with the "Flying Elvis", utilizing a cursive font.

[ 103 ] In 2000, the blue color used on the tricorne of the "Flying Elvis" as well as the outline of the cursive wordmark was switched from royal blue to nautical blue to coincide with the uniform change in the new millennium.

[ 103 ] On July 3, 2013, the Patriots unveiled a new wordmark to accompany the "Flying Elvis", which replaced the script of their previous cursive typeface with modernized block letters (colored in blue or white depending on the background), and modified the "Flying Elvis" to be underneath instead of flowing up-top. While appearing everywhere else, it was not applied on the uniforms until the 2015 season due to NFL uniform policies.

[ 105 ] The Patriots' wordmark used in the Sullivan era between 1960 and 1992 The Patriots' wordmark used from 1993 to 2013, with the blue darkened in 2000. A version with the "Flying Elvis" attached to the top was frequently used The Patriots' wordmark used since 2013. A version with a small "Flying Elvis" underneath the block letters is also commonly seen, such as in the end zone of Gillette Stadium Uniforms 1960–1992 The uniforms worn by the Patriots in the Sullivan era from 1960 to 1992, with variations in the striping throughout the years in the shoulders and sleeves. The face mask color was gray from 1960 to 1981, white from 1982 to 1990 and red from 1991 to 1992.

The Patriots' primary uniforms remained largely unchanged from the franchises' inaugural season until 1993. The Patriots originally wore red jerseys with white block numbering at home, and white jerseys with red block numbering on the road. Both uniforms used white pants and white helmets, first with the hat logo over the player's number, then with the "Pat Patriot" logo starting in 1961.

[ 106 ] A blue stripe was added to the two red helmet stripes in 1964.

[ 106 ] The numbers on both the home and away jerseys gained a blue outline in 1973.

[ 106 ] In 1979, the Patriots began the first of many sporadic runs of wearing red pants with the white jerseys.

[ 106 ] The red pants were dropped in 1981, but returned in 1984. After being dropped again in 1988, they were used again from 1990 to 1992.

[ 106 ] 1993–1999 The uniforms worn by the Patriots in the early Kraft era from 1993 to 1999, with alterations specifically in the numbers, shoulders, and stripes between 1993 and 1995 before finally settling on a look until 2000. The face mask color also changed from silver in 1993 to red in 1994–present.

The Patriots underwent a complete identity overhaul before the 1993 season, starting with the introduction of the aforementioned "Flying Elvis" logo. The new uniforms consisted of a royal blue home jersey and a white away jersey.

[ 103 ] The helmet was silver with the Flying Elvis logo and no additional striping.

[ 103 ] Both uniforms used silver pants, originally with stripes designed to look like those flowing from the Flying Elvis, but these were changed to simple red and blue stripes after one season. When they debuted, both the home and away jerseys used red block numbers with a blue and white outline, but after one season the home uniforms switched to the now-familiar white with a red outline.

[ 107 ] In 1995, the Patriots switched the block numbers to a more modern rounded number font with a dropshadow.

[ 107 ] The Patriots were one of the first adopters of custom numbers, a trend that would grow drastically over the next 20 years.

[ 107 ] 2000–2019 The primary uniforms worn by the Patriots in the dynasty era from 2000 to 2019, including a red throwback version released in 2002, then not seen again until 2010. The pictured red throwback had minor differences from each variation from 2002, 2010–2012 before being shelved due to NFL helmet policies. The Patriots also wore red AFL-patched throwback jerseys (for the 50th anniversary of the AFL) in 2009, however those jerseys were more based on the 1961 season specific appearance.

In 2000, the Patriots then became one of the few teams at the time to drop the rounded numbers and switch back to block numbers. The shade of blue was switched for the first time in the franchises' history, from royal to nautical blue. The jerseys once again had the number on the shoulders while the logo moved back to the sleeves. "New Century" silver stripes were also added to the home jersey, with nautical blue stripes appearing on the away jersey. The Patriots, unsatisfied with the 1990s white-on-silver road look, also took the opportunity to introduce blue pants to be worn with the white jersey, offering a better contrast. To better match the blue pants, the number on the white jersey was switched from red to blue.

[ 108 ] Though the Patriots had generally worn silver pants with the blue jerseys, and navy pants with the white jerseys, they did wear an all-blue set during the 2002 season. On two consecutive home games that season, the Patriots wore blue tops with their road blue pants and white socks; they lost both games (Week 6 vs. the Packers, and Week 8 vs. the Broncos). The team would not wear an all-blue set again until the introduction of the Color Rush uniforms in 2016.

[ 108 ] Throughout the 2011 season , the Patriots wore dark patches with white lettering on their uniforms with the initials 'MHK' in honor of Myra Kraft , the late long-time spouse of owner Robert Kraft.

[ 109 ] 2020–present The primary uniforms worn by the Patriots in the post-dynasty era from 2020–present, with the red throwback returning for use starting in the 2022 season, due to the NFL reverting their helmet policies. Silver pants were added to kit in the 2022 season as an alternate look, and were used entirely for the last half of the 2024 season.

In 2020, the Patriots made some changes to their uniform. The all-blue "Color Rush" design became the primary home uniform, complete with a tweaked nameplate font and numbers, and blue/red/white socks. A corresponding white uniform was also unveiled, also paired with the blue pants. Both uniforms featured truncated shoulder striping as a nod to the "Pat Patriot" uniforms. Coincidentally, the arrival of new jerseys occurred with the departure of long-time quarterback, Tom Brady , from the Patriots. Brady was in New England exactly between the last uniform change in 2000, and left before the 2020 uniform change in 2019.

[ 110 ] [ 111 ] [ 112 ] The Patriots brought back the silver pants to pair with the current uniforms in a 2022 Week 7 home game on Monday Night Football against the Chicago Bears . Unlike the previous silver pants the team wore from 2000 to 2019, this design featured thicker red stripes, matching the same width as the middle blue stripe.

[ 113 ] During a 2024 Week 7 road game at Wembley Stadium against the Jacksonville Jaguars , the Patriots paired their silver pants with the road white uniform for the first time since 1999. After their largest victory of the 2024 season in a Week 10 road game dressed again in the silver pants with the road white uniform, the Patriots quietly promoted the silver pants to full-time use with both the home and road uniform for the rest of the season.

[ 114 ] Alternate uniforms In 1994, the Patriots wore the "Pat Patriot" helmets and plain white striped pants from two seasons prior as alternates as part of the NFL's 75th-anniversary celebration. In 2002, NFL teams were allowed to add a permanent third jersey to be worn in a maximum of two games. The Patriots reintroduced a red jersey as their alternate, complemented with the old-style "Pat Patriot" helmet.

[ 103 ] In 2003, the Patriots changed their alternate to a silver jersey with blue pants. For this uniform, the "Flying Elvis" helmet was used.

[ 103 ] The uniform was identical to the white jersey with any areas of white replaced by silver. These uniforms were dropped after 2007. No alternate uniform was used in 2008. In 2009, the red alternate was reintroduced, again accompanied by the "Pat Patriot" helmet. An alternate white road jersey was also worn with the older helmet for one game, using red numbers, in tribute to the 50th anniversary of the AFL. The red alternate gained a blue outline around the numbers in 2010 and this was worn through 2012. The Patriots temporarily retired their alternate red uniforms in 2013, thanks to a new NFL rule outlawing throwback alternate helmets, and restricting teams to one helmet shell only.

[ 115 ] However, after the NFL reinstated the use of alternate helmets in 2022, the Patriots brought back the throwback red uniforms.

[ 116 ] In 2016, the Patriots took part in the NFL's Color Rush program, wearing monochrome navy uniforms on September 22 against the Houston Texans .

[ 117 ] The uniform tops were patterned after the 1980s Pat Patriot-era uniforms, while the pants featured thick white stripes with red accents. They have worn them a total of four times since 2016. In 2017, an all-white Color Rush uniform was introduced and used for the Patriots' Thursday night road game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers .

[ 118 ] Facilities Stadium and headquarters Main article: Gillette Stadium Since 2002, the Patriots' home stadium has been Gillette Stadium , a $350 million facility privately financed by Robert Kraft , located in Foxborough, Massachusetts . It houses the team's practice facilities, the team's administrative offices, as well as its owning entity's, The Kraft Group , along with the Kraft-owned Major League Soccer team, the New England Revolution .

[ 119 ] The field, which was originally natural grass, was replaced with a FieldTurf surface during the 2006 season.

[ 120 ] The Patriots installed a new video board, the largest in the United States, in 2023.

[ 121 ] Despite not being around for more than 20 years, Gillette Stadium is home to the second most postseason games ever, Candlestick Park being first with 27 total. The Patriots have a 19–4 playoff record in this stadium as of the conclusion of the 2019 NFL season , the AFC playoffs consistently had the Patriots playing from home in 2001–2019.

[ 122 ] [ 123 ] The area around the stadium was developed, beginning in 2007, into a $375 million "lifestyle and entertainment center" called Patriot Place ; among its largest structures is a multi-floor restaurant and bar called CBS Scene .

[ 124 ] Prior to 2002, the Patriots played in Foxboro Stadium dating back to 1971, the team's second year in the NFL after the AFL–NFL merger, and this venue was also privately funded. The final game in this stadium was the 2001 AFC Divisional Playoff game which was a 16–13 overtime win over the visiting Oakland Raiders , known for the raging snowstorm and the "tuck rule" call.

[ 119 ] During the team's days in the American Football League and its first year in the NFL, the Boston Patriots were hosted by a number of fields in or around Boston .

[ 119 ] Aerial view of Foxboro Stadium , where the Patriots played for their first 31 seasons in Foxborough, Massachusetts after not being able to find a permanent home in Boston , from 1971 to 2001 The field of Gillette Stadium , the current home stadium of the Patriots in Foxborough since 2002 Stadium history Boston's Fenway Park was the home stadium of the Patriots from 1963 to 1968 Stadium Location Duration Boston University Field Boston, Massachusetts 1960–1962 Fenway Park 1963–1968 Alumni Stadium Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts 1969 Harvard Stadium Allston, Massachusetts 1970 Foxboro Stadium Foxborough, Massachusetts 1971–2001 Gillette Stadium 2002–present Training camp and practice Patriots players during training camp in 2009 The Patriots hold training camp and practices just outside of Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, with twin practice fields available for team use.

Prior to 2003, the Patriots held training camp and practice at numerous locations. From 1976 to 2002, the team held training camp at Bryant College in Smithfield, Rhode Island . From 1960 to 1961, then from 1969 to 1975, the Patriots held training camp at University of Massachusetts Amherst . Between 1962 and 1968, the Patriots held training camp at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts .

[ 125 ] From 1971 until 2001, the Patriots would simply practice at Foxboro Stadium whenever the field was available, otherwise they would use the public football fields that were available in Foxborough.

Aircraft One of the two Patriots' 767s taxiing at Logan International Airport in 2020 In 2017, the Patriots purchased two Boeing 767-300ERs for use as team planes, with one serving as the backup, which were ready in time for the 2017 NFL season . This made them the first team in league history to own their own planes.

[ 126 ] At the time it was getting more difficult for professional sports teams to book private charter flights, with eight teams being dropped that season, as major commercial airlines were instead focusing on more profitable scheduled flights.

[ 127 ] The two jet airliners, N366AA and N39367, were previously operated by American Airlines from 1991 to 2016. The planes are known affectionately as "AirKrafts" after team owner Robert Kraft .

[ 128 ] Kraft lent one of the planes to transport students to the March for Our Lives demonstration in Washington, D.C.

in 2018.

[ 129 ] In 2020, the New England Patriots signed an agreement with Eastern Airlines to handle the operations of their planes. In July 2023, the Patriots filed a lawsuit against Eastern Airlines over an alleged breach of contract.

[ 130 ] Since February 2024, both planes now operate with Omni Air International .

[ 131 ] Rivalries In terms of number of games played, the Patriots have competed most against other teams in the AFC East division: the Buffalo Bills , Miami Dolphins , and New York Jets , who were all a part of the AFC East division since the AFL–NFL merger, as well as the former AFL Eastern division. The Patriots also share rivalries with several teams outside of their division, including the Indianapolis Colts , who were members of the AFC East from 1970 to 2001, the Baltimore Ravens , the Denver Broncos , the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Las Vegas Raiders . Outside of the AFC, the Patriots also had a memorable rivalry with the New York Giants .

Divisional rivals New York Jets Main article: Jets–Patriots rivalry Bill Belichick , after resigning from the Jets before ever coaching a game, was "traded" from the Jets to the Patriots in 2000 for a first round pick, which turned out to be one of the most notorious transactions in NFL history.

[ 132 ] The closest rivalry geographically has been that with the New York Jets .

[ 133 ] The Patriots and Jets have been in the same division (what is now the AFC East) since both teams' founding's in 1960 and have played each other at least twice a year since then.

[ 134 ] The rivalry between the Jets and Patriots has escalated since 1996, when Patriots head coach Bill Parcells left the Patriots under controversy to become the head coach of the Jets; he was replaced by former Jets coach Pete Carroll .

[ 134 ] Four years later, Carroll was fired, and Parcells's assistant, Bill Belichick , resigned the day he was named the Jets' head coach to become the head coach of the Patriots.

[ 135 ] Six years after that, Eric Mangini , an assistant under Belichick, became the head coach of the Jets.

[ 136 ] Bill Belichick achieved his 200th career head coaching win (regular season and playoffs) on November 22, 2012, defeating the Jets 49–19 ; it was his 163rd such win as Patriots coach.

[ 137 ] Belichick also passed George Halas for second most career head coaching wins (regular season and playoffs) with his 325th win on October 30, 2022, in a 22–17 victory over the Jets. As of 2023, the Patriots lead the all-time series 75–55–1.

[ 138 ] Buffalo Bills Main article: Bills–Patriots rivalry DT Ty Warren takes down Bills QB J. P. Losman for a safety in 2006.

The Patriots and the Bills were both charter members of the AFL and even competed with each other in an AFL playoff game. They have remained divisional rivals since the AFL–NFL merger. Prior to the rise of Tom Brady, the two teams shared a mellow, yet occasionally competitive rivalry, featuring highlights from players such as O. J. Simpson , Steve Grogan , Joe Ferguson , Jim Kelly , and Drew Bledsoe . However, Brady dominated the Bills during his tenure as the Patriots' franchise quarterback, holding a 32–3 regular-season record over them.

[ 139 ] Though Patriots fans usually felt apathetic towards the Bills during the Brady era, Bills fans came to despise the Patriots more than any other rival.

[ 140 ] With the departure of Tom Brady after the 2019 season, the Bills swept the Pats in 2020, including a 38–9 Monday Night Football win that stands as the worst home loss of the Belichick era. It was their first time doing so since 1999, Belichick's first year as head coach and the year before Brady was drafted.

[ 141 ] In the 2021–22 NFL playoffs , the Bills defeated the Patriots 47–17 in the rivalry's first playoff matchup in nearly 60 years, with the Bills scoring seven consecutive touchdowns and never punting or attempting a field goal against the Pats defense, [ 142 ] making for the NFL's first "perfect offensive game" in history and the worst playoff loss of Belichick's career.

[ 143 ] As of 2023, the Patriots lead the all-time series 78–50–1.

[ 144 ] Miami Dolphins Main article: Dolphins–Patriots rivalry RB Craig James rushes the ball past the Dolphins' defense in the 1985 AFC Championship game .

The Patriots first played the Miami Dolphins in 1966 in the AFL, when Miami was one of two expansion teams to debut that year in that league. The Dolphins dominated the Patriots in the 1970s and 1990s, but the two teams remained competitive with each other for years before the rise of Tom Brady. Brady, however, struggled occasionally against the Dolphins in the 2000s before reasserting dominance in the 2010s.

[ 145 ] [ 146 ] The Patriots and Dolphins are the only two teams in the Super Bowl era to post undefeated regular season records, with Miami going 14–0 in 1972 and the Patriots going 16–0 in 2007 .

[ 147 ] Notable moments between the clubs include the Snowplow Game , three playoff matchups, the Dolphins revealing their Wildcat offense against the Patriots, [ 148 ] and the Miracle in Miami .

[ 149 ] As of 2023, the Dolphins lead the all-time series 62–55.

[ 150 ] Conference rivals Baltimore/Indianapolis Colts Main article: Colts–Patriots rivalry See also: Tom Brady–Peyton Manning rivalry The Patriots rivalry with the Indianapolis Colts ran through the two clubs' tenure together in the AFC East (1970–2001). The two clubs clashed in several close games, such as on December 19, 1971, as a late Patriots touchdown decided a 21–17 New England win; on September 18, 1978, the Colts rallied to defeat the Patriots 34–27 on Monday Night Football on a virtual one-man scoring rampage by running back Joe Washington ; on September 4, 1983, the Colts defeated the Patriots in overtime 29–23 in their final season in Baltimore.

[ 151 ] The Patriots defeated the Colts in back-to-back overtime games, 23–17 on December 8, 1991, and 37–34 on November 15, 1992.

[ 151 ] The Pats facing the Colts in 2011 Even though the two clubs were placed in separate divisions in the NFL's 2002 divisional realignment, their rivalry did not diminish. At that time, both teams were among the best in the AFC, and both were led by likely Hall of Fame quarterbacks, Peyton Manning (for the Colts) and Tom Brady (for the Patriots). The teams met three times in four years (2003, 2004, 2006) in the playoffs, with the winner going on to win that season's Super Bowl each time. The Manning portion of the rivalry began in Manning's rookie season, 1998; in 1999 Manning suffered a bitter 31–28 loss in September as the Patriots behind Drew Bledsoe erased a 28–7 Colts lead, then defeated the Patriots 20–15 in Indianapolis on December 12. The Brady–Manning portion of the rivalry began on September 30, 2001, as Brady made his first NFL start in a 44–13 Patriots win at Foxboro; on October 21 the Patriots defeated the Colts at the RCA Dome 38–17.

[ 151 ] After the Colts left the AFC East in 2002, they first met on November 30, 2003, in a 38–34 Patriots win decided on a last-second goal line stand by the Patriots.

[ 151 ] The Colts broke a six-game Patriot winning streak in the rivalry in November 2005, [ 151 ] then won twice in 2006; [ 151 ] in the AFC Championship Game the Colts erased a 21–6 halftime lead; the game lead tied or changed seven times in the second half before a late touchdown led to a 38–34 Colts win. The November 4, 2007, meeting involved both teams being unbeaten to that point; the 8–0 Patriots and the 7–0 Colts. The Patriots rallied to win 24–20.

[ 152 ] The Colts won again in 2008 and then erased a large Patriots lead in 2009's 4th and 2 game. Manning's final meeting with the Patriots as a Colt came in November 2010; a late interception sealed a 31–28 Patriots win.

[ 153 ] In 2012, the Patriots faced the Colts, quarterbacked now by Andrew Luck , on November 18; the Patriots defeated the Colts 59–24.

[ 154 ] The Patriots also beat the Colts on January 12, 2014, 43–22.

[ 155 ] The Patriots played the Colts in the playoffs again on January 18, 2015, in the AFC title game, winning 45–7.

[ 156 ] As of the 2023 season, the Patriots lead the all-time series 53–31.

[ 157 ] Baltimore Ravens Main article: Patriots–Ravens rivalry The Ravens first met the New England Patriots in 1996, [ 158 ] but the rivalry truly started in 2007 when the Ravens suffered a bitter 27–24 loss in the Patriots' quest for perfection .

[ 159 ] The rivalry began to escalate in 2009 when the Ravens lost to the Patriots 27–21 in a game that saw a confrontation between Patriots quarterback Tom Brady and Ravens linebacker Terrell Suggs .

[ 160 ] Both players took verbal shots at each other through the media after the game. The Ravens defeated the Patriots in the 2009 AFC Wild Card playoff game, 33–14, [ 161 ] the first time the former defeated the latter.
The Ravens faced the Patriots in week six of the 2010 season. The Patriots won 23–20 in overtime; the game caused controversy from a hit to the helmet of tight end Todd Heap by Patriots safety Brandon Meriweather .

[ 162 ] The Ravens played the Patriots for the third consecutive season in the 2011 AFC Championship Game, which the Ravens lost 23–20.

[ 163 ] The rivalry reached a new level of friction with this second playoff game between the two clubs. The Ravens clawed to a 20–16 lead in the fourth quarter, but Patriots quarterback Tom Brady dove into the end zone to make the score 23–20 with around 11 minutes remaining; this proved to be the winning touchdown.

[ 163 ] On the Ravens' last possession of the game, quarterback Joe Flacco threw a pass to wide receiver Lee Evans in the corner of the end zone that looked to be the game-winning touchdown, before a last-second strip by Sterling Moore forced the ball from the hands of Evans, forcing the game to be decided by a last-minute field goal by Ravens placekicker Billy Cundiff.

[ 163 ] With 11 seconds remaining, the kicker missed the 32-yard field goal attempt, allowing the Patriots to kill the clock on their way to Super Bowl XLVI for a rematch with the New York Giants .

[ 163 ] The Ravens' first regular-season win over the Patriots came on September 23, 2012. The game was emotional as receiver Torrey Smith was competing hours after the death of his brother in a motorcycle accident.

[ 164 ] Smith caught two touchdowns in a back-and-forth game; the Ravens erased a 13–0 lead in the first half and led 14–13, but the Patriots scored at the end of the second quarter for a 20–14 lead. The lead changed twice in the third quarter and the Patriots led 30–21 in the fourth, but the Ravens scored on Smith's second touchdown catch. The Ravens were stopped on fourth down but the Patriots had to punt; in the final two minutes, a pass-interference penalty on Devin McCourty put the ball at the Patriots 7-yard line; new Ravens kicker Justin Tucker booted a 27-yard field goal on the final play; the ball sailed directly over the upright and was ruled good.

Bill Belichick angrily reached for one of the referees as they were leaving the field, leading to a $50,000 fine later that week.

[ 165 ] [ 166 ] The two teams met on January 20, 2013, in the AFC Championship, where the Ravens won 28–13.

[ 167 ] The Patriots led at halftime, 13–7, but the Ravens defense gave up no points in the 2nd half.

[ 167 ] It was the first time Tom Brady lost a game at home after leading at halftime, and the first time a road team beat the Patriots in the AFC Championship.

[ 167 ] The two teams met at Gillette Stadium in the playoffs on January 10, 2015. The Patriots trailed by as much as 14 twice, before beating the Ravens 35–31 to advance to the AFC Championship.

[ 168 ] The two teams met with Lamar Jackson as the Ravens quarterback for the first time on Sunday Night Football on November 3, 2019. The 8–0 Patriots were favored over the 5–2 Ravens before the game, but the Ravens won in a blowout, 37–20.

[ 169 ] As of the 2023 season, the Patriots lead the all-time series 11–5.

Denver Broncos Main article: Broncos–Patriots rivalry See also: Tom Brady–Peyton Manning rivalry The Broncos and Patriots met twice annually during the American Football League (AFL) years from 1960 to 1969, and played in the first-ever AFL game on September 9, 1960.

[ 170 ] Since 1995 , the two teams have met frequently during the regular season, including nine consecutive seasons from 1995 to 2003.

[ 171 ] As of the end of the 2015 season, the two teams have met in the playoffs five times, with the Broncos owning a 4–1 record.

[ 172 ] The teams' first playoff match on January 4, 1987, was John Elway 's first career playoff win, [ 173 ] while the teams' second playoff match on January 14, 2006, game was the Broncos' first playoff win since Elway's retirement after the 1998 season .

[ 174 ] The game was also notable for Champ Bailey 's 100-yard interception that resulted in a touchdown-saving tackle by Benjamin Watson at the 1-yard line.

[ 175 ] On October 11, 2009, the two teams met with former Patriots' offensive coordinator, Josh McDaniels as the Broncos' head coach . Both teams wore their AFL 50th anniversary jerseys.

[ 176 ] The game featured a 98-yard drive in the fourth quarter, with a game-tying touchdown pass from Kyle Orton to Brandon Marshall , followed by an overtime drive led by Orton that led to a 41-yard game-winning field goal by Matt Prater .

[ 177 ] The two teams met in the Divisional round of the 2011 playoffs , with the Patriots blowing out Tim Tebow and the Broncos by a score of 45–10.

[ 178 ] The Broncos' rivalry with the Patriots later intensified when longtime Indianapolis Colts ' quarterback Peyton Manning became the Broncos' starting quarterback from 2012 to 2015. Manning and Patriots' quarterback Tom Brady maintained a legendary rivalry from 2001 [ 179 ] until Manning's retirement after the 2015 season.

[ 180 ] Though Brady dominated Manning in regular season play, winning nine of twelve meetings, Manning won three of five playoff meetings, including the Broncos' 26–16 win in the 2013 AFC Championship and the Broncos' 20–18 win in the 2015 AFC Championship .

[ 181 ] As of the 2023 season, the Broncos lead the all-time series 31–24.

[ 182 ] Pittsburgh Steelers Main article: Patriots–Steelers rivalry The Pittsburgh Steelers emerged as a prominent rival in league circles when the Patriots upset the Steelers in the 2001 AFC Championship Game at Heinz Field , though the two teams had met in the postseason twice before; the Patriots defeated the Steelers in 1996 28–3 while the Steelers won 7–6 in 1997 ; both times, the Patriots fielded players with Pittsburgh-area roots in Ty Law and Curtis Martin . Martin's final game with the Patriots was in the 1997 playoffs before he departed to the rival New York Jets . After the 2001 AFC title upset, the Patriots defeated the Steelers 30–14 at the start of the 2002 season. Pittsburgh did not exact revenge for the two losses until ending the Patriots' record-setting 21-game winning streak in week 6 of the 2004 NFL season .

[ 183 ] Later that season, the Steelers lost to the eventual Super Bowl champion Patriots in the AFC Championship game after a 15–1 regular season.

The Patriots won six of seven meetings over a decade ( 1998 – 2007 ) before the Steelers broke through with a 33–10 victory at Foxborough in 2008 , after Matt Cassel turned the ball over five times. The Patriots in 2013 then became the first opponent to score 55 points on the Steelers, winning 55–31. The Patriots won again in 2015 (28–21) and 2016's regular season (27–16) and then won 36–17 in the 2016 AFC Championship Game . They also won in 2017 when a go-ahead touchdown reception by Steelers' tight end Jesse James was controversially called back.

[ 184 ] Though they ultimately missed the playoffs, the Steelers defeated the Patriots by a score of 17–10 on December 16, 2018, in Pittsburgh.

In the postseason, the Patriots have outscored the Steelers 135–75, with the Patriots maintaining a 4–1 record. The only other franchises with winning AFC playoff records against Steelers include the Los Angeles Chargers (2–1), the Jacksonville Jaguars (2–0), and the Denver Broncos (5–3). The Steelers have an all-time regular-season record of 15–13 against the Patriots. In the Bill Belichick era, the main period of the rivalry, the Patriots have a 12–4 record against the Steelers. In their last matchup, the Patriots beat the Steelers 33–3 on Sunday Night Football .

[ 185 ] As of the 2023 season, the Patriots lead the all-time series 19–16.

[ 186 ] Oakland/Los Angeles/Las Vegas Raiders The rivalry between the Patriots and the Raiders dates to their time in the AFL, but was intensified during a 1978 preseason game, when Patriots wide receiver Darryl Stingley was permanently paralyzed after a vicious hit delivered by Raiders free safety Jack Tatum . Before that, the Patriots also lost a playoff game in 1976 to the Raiders; the game is unofficially known as "The Ben Dreith Game" due to a controversial penalty by head referee Dreith. While based in Los Angeles, the Raiders hosted the Patriots in the divisional round of the playoffs in 1986. The game was won by the Patriots and marred by a chaotic rumble between the teams in the end zone as players were leaving the field after the game. The brawl was especially notable for Raiders linebacker Matt Millen attacking GM Patrick Sullivan , son of owner Billy Sullivan, with his helmet. The two teams met in a divisional round playoff game in 2002, which became known as the " Tuck Rule Game ". Late in the game, an incomplete pass, ruled a fumble, by quarterback Tom Brady was overturned, and the Patriots went on to win in overtime and eventually won the Super Bowl against the heavily favored St. Louis Rams .

[ 187 ] Since that game, the Patriots have won five of the last six regular-season contests between the two teams. In 2002, the Raiders won 27–20 in Oakland; in the 2005 season opener in New England, the Patriots ruined Randy Moss ' debut as a Raider, 30–20; the Patriots defeated the Raiders 49–26 in December 2008 in Bill Belichick 's 100th regular-season win as Patriots coach; a Patriots 31–19 win during the 2011 season ; a scrappy 16–9 Patriots win in the third week of the 2014 season , and the Patriots' 33–8 win in Mexico City in 2017 , and after a last-minute lateral play that went awry , a Raider win 30–24.

[ 188 ] The win also snapped a six-game losing streak against the Patriots. The two teams met again the next season, when the Raiders defeated the Patriots 21–17. The Patriots lead the all-time series 20–17–1.

[ 189 ] Interconference rivals New York Giants Main article: Giants–Patriots rivalry The Patriots' sideline pictured in 2007 , during the historic 16–0 regular season. It was the only undefeated regular season in the NFL during the 16-game schedule era. The Patriots had defeated the Giants in the final game of the regular season, however the Giants would then upset the Patriots in Super Bowl XLII .

The two teams rarely played each other given they were on opposite conferences, but the rivalry gained notoriety in the late 2000s thanks to some close contests and memorable moments between Tom Brady and Eli Manning . In the 2007 season, the Patriots defeated the Giants 38–35 to clinch a perfect 16–0 regular season but could not finish a perfect 19–0 season in Super Bowl XLII after a 17–14 defeat. That game featured the Helmet Catch from David Tyree . The Giants also defeated the Patriots in Super Bowl XLVI , a 21–17 victory.

[ 190 ] As of the 2023 season, the series was tied 7–7.

[ 191 ] Strategy and influence Further information: New England Patriots strategy LB Willie McGinest ( left ), LB Tedy Bruschi ( middle ), and LB Mike Vrabel ( right ) are three Patriots credited for instilling and defining what was described the "Patriot Way" throughout the dynasty from 2001 to 2019.

Under head coach Bill Belichick, the Patriots employed specific on-field and off-field strategies. On the field, the Patriots typically used an " Erhardt – Perkins " offense and a " Fairbanks – Bullough " 3–4 defense , referred to commonly as a two-gap 3–4 defensive system. Under Erhardt's, Perkin's and Bullough's stints as coordinators and head coaches across the league after developing the scheme in collaboration with head coach Chuck Fairbanks, the systems developed in New England in the 1970s would begin to see historic use. Influence spread, especially under their coaching tree in Bill Parcells ' schemes as head coach of the New York Giants in the mid-to-late 1980s, after serving as a linebacker coach for the Patriots in 1980. Parcells would come back to New England as head coach in 1993 and re-install the system used in the 1970s and 1980s, re-uniting with Ray Perkins as WR coach. Parcells own coaching tree would use the scheme created in New England as well, especially Belichick, once he was named as head coach after years of being an assistant to Parcells with the New York Giants, the Patriots, and the New York Jets .

[ 192 ] During Belichick's tenure, the philosophy in making personnel decisions and in game planning focused on the "team" concept, [ 193 ] stressing preparation, strong work ethic, versatility, [ 194 ] and lack of individual ego.

[ 195 ] This approach, which led to six Super Bowl victories under Belichick, has been analyzed in media such as the 2004 book Patriot Reign , as well as the 2021 documentary miniseries Man in the Arena .

The team culture under Belichick, dubbed the "Patriot Way", included: A self-critical, perfectionist, and militaristic approach [ 196 ] An emphasis on team, [ 197 ] equality among players and lack of individual ego [ 198 ] A strong work ethic, intelligence and high level of focus and preparation for each individual game [ 199 ] Versatile players, able to play multiple positions [ 200 ] Multiple schemes intended to take advantage of their opponent's weaknesses [ 201 ] [ 202 ] Championships Super Bowl championships The Super Bowl banners for the Patriots' first three league championships at Gillette Stadium .

A Super Bowl hero, CB Malcolm Butler made one of the greatest plays in NFL history with a game-clinching interception at the goal line in Super Bowl XLIX , ensuring the Patriots' victory in the final seconds of the game.

Deion Branch ( top ) and Julian Edelman ( bottom ) are the two Patriots wide receivers that have won the Super Bowl MVP award, each doing so in Super Bowl XXXIX and Super Bowl LIII , respectively.

The New England Patriots have won six Super Bowls , the league championship of the NFL . The franchise is tied for the most all-time with the Pittsburgh Steelers .

Patriots Hall of Fame The Patriots Hall of Fame features 31 former players and four contributors as a part of the franchise's own hall of fame, founded to independently commemorate significant members of the organization within the club's history. It is referred to by the team as "the franchise's highest individual honor". It was established in 1991, with John Hannah being the inaugural member.

[ 225 ] The physical Patriots Hall of Fame building opened in 2008 outside of the stadium at Patriot Place , presented by RTX . Featuring a vast collection of game-worn gear, game-used equipment, memorabilia, trophies, in addition to multiple exhibits using audio and video technology, it is periodically renovated and updated yearly. It is described as a "modern, interactive museum".

[ 226 ] A committee of media and staff selected 11 players for enshrinement between 1991 and 2001, before a six-year span of no selections. In 2007, in advance of the grand opening of the physical Patriots Hall of Fame in 2008, the club introduced a new nomination committee to select three candidates, with the winner of an internet fan vote being enshrined in the hall of fame.

[ 227 ] In order to be eligible, players and head coaches must be retired for at least four years. Beginning in 2011, and meeting every four-to-five years, a senior selection committee has the option of voting a player who has been retired for at least 25 seasons into the hall of fame, alongside the traditional inductee.

[ 228 ] Starting in 2009, long-time "contributors", which can range from roles such as assistant coaches and broadcasters, have been periodically inducted into the Patriots Hall of Fame directly by owner Robert Kraft . Former team owner and founder Billy Sullivan was posthumously inducted in March 2009, before the Patriots' 50th season, as the first contributor inducted.

Ownership The Patriots have had four owners since becoming a franchise, the first being Massachusetts native Billy Sullivan from 1959 to 1988. During Sullivan's 28 seasons of owning the club, the Patriots tallied 14 winning records, made six playoff appearances, played in the 1963 AFL Championship Game and represented the AFC in Super Bowl XX . However, he was also notoriously cheap, and would cause friction with some his high-profile players who were seeking to be respected and paid more, causing someone such as future Pro Football Hall of Famer Mike Haynes to seek an owner who was team first.

[ 234 ] Following his bankruptcy, Sullivan sold the team to Remington Products owner Victor Kiam in 1988.

[ 234 ] The sale did not include Foxboro Stadium , which Sullivan lost in a bankruptcy sale to paper magnate Robert Kraft , and Kiam lost money on the deal. In 1990, Lisa Olson , a Boston Herald reporter, sued Kiam and the Patriots when Zeke Mowatt allegedly exposed himself and made lewd comments to her in the team change room. The incident stirred debate over female reporters in the locker room. Kiam became the center of the controversy when he came to the defense of the players' actions.

[ 235 ] In his later career, Kiam's business interests moved on from the Patriots, so he sold them in 1992 to St. Louis businessman James Orthwein . During his ownership, Orthwein hired Bill Parcells as head coach and oversaw the drafting of first-overall draft pick quarterback Drew Bledsoe , who helped to return the moribund franchise to respectability. He planned to relocate the Patriots franchise to St. Louis, renaming the team the St. Louis Stallions . However, those plans were derailed when Boston paper magnate Robert Kraft , owner of Foxboro Stadium , refused to accept a buyout of the lease. Kraft used his ownership of the stadium to stage a hostile takeover , offering to pay $175 million for the Patriots franchise knowing that Orthwein no longer wanted the team if he could not move it to St. Louis. Although future St. Louis/Los Angeles Rams owner Stan Kroenke offered to buy the team for $200 million and move it to St. Louis, Orthwein would have been saddled with all moving expenses. He also would have been responsible for any legal expenses as well, and Kraft had already made it clear that he would go to court to enforce the lease. With no other choice, Orthwein accepted Kraft's bid on January 21, 1994.

[ 236 ] Kraft had been a life-long fan (he was a season ticket holder since 1971) before he purchased the team and intended to support them much more than all of the previous owners did, making multiple moves that have turned New England into an admirable franchise since. The Patriots under Kraft have been the NFL's most successful franchise since 1994. Since then, the Patriots have appeared in ten Super Bowls, have won six, and had numerous league records established by the franchise.

The longest tenured and winningest coach in franchise history, he is widely regarded as one of the greatest coaches of all time.

The Patriots have had 16 head coaches throughout their history as a franchise. On January 12, 2025, the Patriots hired Mike Vrabel as their 16th head coach in franchise history, he is the second coach in the club's history to have played for the team (2001–2008).

[ 239 ] [ 240 ] Bill Belichick had the longest tenure as head coach (23 seasons) with the Patriots, and coached the team from 2000 to 2023 . He has been widely considered one of the greatest coaches of all time, and was named a member of the NFL 100th All-Time Anniversary Team , due to his numerous accomplishments with the Patriots.

[ 241 ] He specifically led the Patriots to 17 AFC East division titles, 13 appearances in the AFC Championship Game , and nine Super Bowl appearances, with a record six wins.

[ 242 ] Belichick was the NFL's longest-tenured head coach at the time of his departure, as well as the first all-time in playoff coaching wins with 31 and third in regular season coaching wins in the NFL with 297.

[ 243 ] He is one of only three head coaches who have won six NFL titles.

[ 244 ] He was named the NFL Coach of the Year for the 2003 , 2007 , and 2010 seasons .

[ 245 ] Belichick led the team for more regular season games (336), post-season games (42) and more complete seasons (23) than any other head coach. His 266 wins with the Patriots are far and away the most in franchise history, more than quadruple times those of runner-up Mike Holovak .

Belichick was acquired in a "trade" with the rival New York Jets .

[ 246 ] Belichick did not want to be under Bill Parcells ' authority there in 2000, with uncertainty of his role once their owner, Leon Hess , died. The initial promise was that Belichick would've been granted extreme authority over all of the Jets executive decisions, but when Hess died Parcells overruled the stipulation with loopholes, so he would remain in control as general manager, leading to Belichick's infamous resignation in 2000. Parcells, a two winning Super Bowl champion coach with the New York Giants (also was an assistant with the Patriots in the early 1980s), had joined New England's staff for the 1993 season to help resurrect the franchise from its dark early 1990s days but had conflicted interests with owner Robert Kraft.

[ 247 ] In his last year with the Patriots in 1996, Parcells brought in his assistant head coach from his Giants days, Belichick, after being dismissed from coaching five seasons with the Cleveland Browns . Here, Kraft would plant the seeds of a bond between him and Belichick, as Belichick would often mediate issues between Kraft and Parcells. Although Belichick left in 1997 to once again be Parcells assistant in their Jets regime, cold feet about his long-term role there brought him back after negotiating with Kraft, even though he was still under contract with the Jets.

[ 248 ] The Patriots had technically "tampered" in communicating with Belichick. For compensation, the Patriots gave the Jets their first round pick in the 2000 NFL draft , where even without their first round pick, the Patriots would coincidentally draft Tom Brady in the sixth round, widely regarded as the greatest quarterback of all time and the NFL's greatest draft steal.

[ 249 ] While Belichick led the team to nine of their eleven Super Bowl appearances, winning six of them, before him the Patriots saw some championship game appearances. Holovak, Raymond Berry and Parcells all led the Patriots to league championship games, with only one coach failing to reach the Super Bowl. Five Patriots head coaches, Holovak, Chuck Fairbanks , Berry, Parcells, and Belichick, have been named Coach of the Year by at least one major news organization. The first head coach in franchise history was Lou Saban , who coached them to a 7–12–0 record in the 1960 season .

Cheerleaders Main article: New England Patriots Cheerleaders The team's cheerleading squad performing a routine in 2007 The Patriots' professional cheerleading squad is the New England Patriots Cheerleaders which represents the team in the NFL .

[ 252 ] Notable alumni of the cheerleading squad include wrestler Carmella [ 253 ] and model Camille Kostek .

[ 254 ] Long-time cheerleading director Tracy Sormanti, who was the cheer director since 1994 and had been involved with the organization since 1983, died after a three-year battle with multiple myeloma in 2020.

[ 255 ] She was inducted into the Patriots Hall of Fame in 2021 as a contributor.

[ 256 ] Mascots The Patriots' official mascot since 1995 has been Pat Patriot , a revolutionary minuteman wearing a Patriots home jersey based on the original logo of the same name.

[ 257 ] The Patriots also employ a corps known as the End Zone Militia, a group of American Revolutionary War reenactors founded in 1996 by Geoff Campbell, a reenactor for the 9th Massachusetts Regiment (26th Continental Regiment) .

[ 258 ] Consisting of about 30 men and women, they dress 20 for each home game and split themselves into two groups of 10 lining the back of either end zone. When the Patriots score – whether it be a touchdown , field goal , point-after-touchdown or safety – the militia behind the opposite end zone fire a volley of blanks from flintlock muskets . Per an interview with the Loren & Wally Show on WROR 105.7 FM in and around the time of Super Bowl XLIX , said shots use double the load of black powder than a regular historical reenactor does, specifically 200 grains, in order to be heard throughout the stadium. ESPN writer Josh Pahigian named this one of the top ten celebrations in the league in 2007.

[ 259 ] Fans The team draws much of its fanbase from the New England region of the United States, as well as from the Canadian province of Quebec [ 260 ] [ 261 ] [ 262 ] and much of Atlantic Canada .

[ 263 ] Radio and television For a more comprehensive list, see List of New England Patriots broadcasters .

Map of New England Patriots radio affiliates The Patriots' flagship radio station is WBZ-FM (98.5 FM, otherwise known as "The Sports Hub"), [ 264 ] owned by Beasley Broadcast Group .

[ 265 ] The larger radio network is called the New England Patriots Radio Network , whose 37 affiliate stations span seven states.

[ 264 ] Gil Santos and Gino Cappelletti were the longtime announcing team until their retirement following the conclusion of the 2012 NFL season.

[ 266 ] Santos was replaced by Bob Socci .

[ 264 ] Former Patriots QB Scott Zolak joined the radio team in the 2011 season as a sideline analyst, and in 2013, he replaced Cappelletti as color commentator.

[ 264 ] Any preseason games not on national television are shown on CBS 's O&O WBZ-TV , who also airs the bulk of Patriots regular-season games by virtue of CBS having the rights to most AFC games; CBS also has a presence at the nearby Patriot Place with the "CBS Scene" bar and restaurant. During the regular season whenever the Patriots host an NFC team, the games are aired on Fox affiliate WFXT-TV , and NBC Sunday Night Football games are carried by Boston NBC station WBTS-CD .

[ 264 ] Preseason games were broadcast on ABC affiliate WCVB-TV from 1995 until the change to WBZ in 2009 (WCVB continues to simulcast ESPN's Monday Night Football games featuring the Patriots).

[ 264 ] Don Criqui was play-by-play announcer for the 1995–2012 seasons, with Randy Cross as a color commentator and Mike Lynch as a sideline reporter .

[ 264 ] Lynch was replaced by WBZ reporter Steve Burton in 2009.

[ 264 ] Controversies See also: List of conspiracy theories § New England Patriots Snowplow Game Main article: Snowplow Game During a December 12, 1982, home game against the Miami Dolphins under icy conditions, the game remained scoreless until the fourth quarter when Patriots head coach Ron Meyer motioned to snowplow operator Mark Henderson to specifically clear a spot on the field for New England kicker John Smith so he could kick what proved to be the game-winning 33-yard field goal to give the Patriots a 3–0 win.

[ 267 ] At the time, an emergency ground rule was put into play where the officials could call time-out and allow the ground crew to use a snowplow to clear the yard markers, but not plow often enough to keep the field clear. Dolphins head coach Don Shula , believing it to be against the league rules, pointed out that the league's unfair act clause allowed the league to overturn it, and met with NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle several days later to formally protest the game result. Although Rozelle agreed with Shula that the use of the plow gave the Patriots an unfair advantage, he said that he had never reversed the result of a game and was not going to start doing so for any reason, including cheating.

[ 268 ] Henderson, a convict on work release, jokingly remarked, "What are they gonna do, throw me in jail?" [ 269 ] [ 270 ] The following year, the NFL banned the use of snowplows on the field during a game.

[ 271 ] The Patriots organization has commemorated the game with an exhibit at the Hall at Patriot Place within Gillette Stadium, where the plow itself hangs from the ceiling.

[ 272 ] Spygate Main article: Spygate (NFL) During the 2007 season , the New England Patriots were disciplined by the league for videotaping New York Jets ' defensive coaches' signals from an unauthorized location during a September 9, 2007, game.

[ 273 ] [ 274 ] Videotaping opposing coaches is not illegal in the NFL de jure , but there are designated areas allowed by the league to do such taping. After an investigation, the NFL fined Patriots head coach Bill Belichick $500,000 for his role in the incident, fined the Patriots $250,000, and docked the team their original first-round selection in the 2008 NFL draft , which would have been the 31st pick of the draft.

[ 275 ] Deflategate Main article: Deflategate During the 2015 AFC Championship Game against the Indianapolis Colts , allegations arose that the Patriots were using under-inflated footballs. It was even suggested that the Patriots' staff themselves deliberately deflated the footballs to give their team an unfair advantage during the playoffs.

[ 276 ] [ 277 ] A lengthy investigation and heated debate commenced shortly afterwards, with a full report being published in May 2015.

[ 278 ] [ 279 ] The Wells Report found that balls provided by the Patriots, who were the home team, indeed had less pressure on average than the balls provided by the Colts. Also notable was the findings of some suggestions of communication between Tom Brady and two Patriots locker room attendants, indicating Brady was likely "generally aware" of the situation and that the Patriots staff intentionally deflated the footballs.

[ 279 ] A later study by the American Enterprise Institute called the evidence and methodology of the Wells report "deeply flawed" and "unreliable".

[ 280 ] In the aftermath of the incident, the NFL suspended Brady without pay for the first four games of the 2015 season , fined the Patriots $1 million, and forced them to forfeit their 2016 first round draft pick and 2017 fourth round draft pick.

[ 281 ] Brady appealed his suspension, which was eventually vacated by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York , only for the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to reinstate it a year later for the 2016 NFL season .

[ 282 ] Brady eventually agreed to serve the suspension in 2016, but led the Patriots to win Super Bowl LI in spite of it.

[ 283 ] [ 284 ] Accusations of falsified data However, in February 2022, sportswriter Mike Florio revealed that the NFL falsified data about the Deflategate scandal and hid information that would have cleared the Patriots of wrongdoing. In his book Playmakers: How the NFL Really Works (And Doesn't) , Florio revealed that NFL executives, specifically vice president Troy Vincent , jumped to conclusions about the air pressure inside the Patriots' footballs at halftime of the AFC Championship game. He also noted that 11 of the 12 Patriot footballs used in the game were not outside the predicted range of Ideal Gas Law , and the other was only slightly below.

[ 285 ] Florio also revealed that NFL general counsel Jeff Pash ordered that the records of all PSI data gathered from the 2015 season be deleted. Leaked transcripts revealed that the NFL Senior Vice President of Football Operations, Dave Gardi, used false numbers in his letter to the Patriots which stated that the team was to be investigated. It was also revealed that Vincent did not instruct anyone to record the timing of the measurements taken, the temperature in the room during testing, if the footballs tested were wet or dry, and that he did not know which of the two air pressure gauges was used to make the pregame measurements. Vincent also admitted that he and other NFL executives never heard of the Ideal Gas Law and were unaware that PSI in a football can change in certain environments.
