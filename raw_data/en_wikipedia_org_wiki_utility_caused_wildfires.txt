Utility-caused wildfires are a subset of human-caused wildfires that are directly ignited by utilities , usually power lines . They are unplanned ignitions that can cause wild burns.

[ 1 ] Hotter and drier weather as a result of climate change has been liked to lower moisture content in vegetation , which, along with high tree mortality has created ideal wildfire conditions.

[ 2 ] Ignition often occurs when power lines come in contact with vegetation, whether elevated or on the ground.

[ 1 ] Industry critics claim that the industry is not doing enough to mitigate these disasters.

[ 3 ] Examples [ edit ] Throughout the world, utilities, especially overhead power lines , have caused wildfires.

[ 4 ] In 2023, downed power lines sparked fires in Lahaina , Hawaii .

[ 5 ] In February 2024, on the Texas Panhandle , a decayed utility pole fell on dry grass and sparked the largest wildfire in state history .

[ 6 ] The 2018 Camp Fire , the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in California state history, was caused by a single faulty hook on a PG&E transmission line.

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] In the notorious 2009 ' Black Saturday ' fires in Victoria , Australia fires sparked by power lines killed 159 people and caused more than $4 billion (AUS) dollars in damages.

[ 9 ] In Greece , on August 11th 2024, a wooden electricity pillar with a loose cable held with a clothes hanger , sparked a fire that killed one woman and burned over 10,000 hectares.

[ 10 ] Causes [ edit ] Utility-cased wildfires can be started by a variety of factors.

Downed lines [ edit ] The vast majority of transmission lines, over 70%, in the United States are outdated, and are near 25 years old.

[ 11 ] The average age for power transformers that power over 90% of the country is 40 years old.

[ 12 ] Power lines, whether old or new, are susceptible to storm damage, and, in 30% of cases, the power line does not automatically shut off.

[ 13 ] This can happen when the fallen line draws too little electric current to activate a fuse or circuit breaker .

[ 13 ] These high-impedance faults (HiZ) can cause high-energy, high-temperature arcing that can cause ignition.

[ 13 ] Contact with vegetation and foreign objects [ edit ] Vegetation contact, and contact with foreign objects, such as trees, are leading causes of wildfires.

[ 1 ] In California, these factors were responsible for 35%, and 18%, respectively, of utility-related fires larger than 10 acres.

[ 1 ] Strong winds have been known to exacerbate these problems.

[ 1 ] Live wires can ignite dry vegetation and fuels, and fallen trees can result in downed lines.

[ 13 ] Conductor slap [ edit ] Power lines are traditionally designed with significant clearance between conductors , this prevents them from contacting under normal operating conditions.

[ 14 ] Under poor conditions, line conductors can slap against one another; this causes high energy arcing, and, occasionally, small bits of molten metal (generally aluminum ) are ejected.

[ 15 ] These ejected pieces of molten aluminum can ignite wildfires.

[ 13 ] Component failure [ edit ] Many components, such as switches , transformers and insulators , contain thousands of complex circuits and parts.

[ 16 ] While often able to effectively provide service for decades, they do eventually fail.

[ 13 ] Occasionally, before complete failures, there is electric arcing and sparks that are too small to be detected by fail-safe sensors.

[ 13 ] These sparks and electric arcs can result in the ignition of vegetation or foreign objects.

[ 13 ] Solutions [ edit ] Electric companies are investigating solutions such as burying power lines, installing sensors , and using software to monitor cables and automatically shut them off.

[ 3 ] In 2023 wildfire mitigation plans, Californian utility companies proposed over $9 billion to mitigate factors that cause wildfires.
