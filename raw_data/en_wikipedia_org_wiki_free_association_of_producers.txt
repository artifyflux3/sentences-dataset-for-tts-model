A key feature of socialist economics , it has been defined differently by different schools of socialism, entailing either the individual , collective or common ownership of the means of production.

Socialist theory [ edit ] The free association of producers is a defining characteristic of socialism . It entails the abolition of private ownership of the means of production and its transfer to the ownership of workers, either as individuals or as self-managed collectives.

[ 1 ] Social equality , cooperation and workers' self-management are the main conditions required for the development of a free association of producers. Under free association, workers themselves determine what to produce, as well as why, how and for whom they will produce it.

[ 2 ] The French socialist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon defined socialism as a free association of producers and smallholders . Proudhon argued for the abolition of capitalism , under which private ownership of the means of production had imposed " wage slavery " on artisans and farmers . He believed that socialism would end the capitalist monopoly over the means of production and thereby allow both free competition and cooperation to flourish.

[ 3 ] In contrast, the German communist Karl Marx defined socialism as the abolition of all private property , rather than a redistribution of it as proposed by Proudhon. Marx considered free association to entail the collective ownership of the means of production and the abolition of profit , rather than association between competing small property owners, and opposed Proudhon's ideas on competition as antithetical to socialism.

[ 3 ] The Russian anarchist Mikhail Bakunin also considered a free association of producers to entail the abolition of private property, and instead advocated that the means of production be brought under common ownership . He also called for the abolition of the state and the construction of free association from the bottom-up .
