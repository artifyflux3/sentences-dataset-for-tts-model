[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Ancient Egyptian units of measurement [ edit ] Main article: Ancient Egyptian units of measurement Units during the ending of the 19th century [ edit ] A number of units were used in Egypt. Units and their interrelations were very variable in the national system.

[ 1 ] Since 1891 their metric equivalences have been defined.

[ 1 ] Length [ edit ] A number of units were used to measure length. One derah baladi was equal to 0.58 m and one kassabah was equal to 3.55 m, according to the metric equivalences defined in 1891.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Some other units according to the metric equivalences defined in 1891 are given below: [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] 1 kirat = 1 ⁄ 24 dirra 1 abdat = 1 ⁄ 6 dirra 1 kadam = 1 ⁄ 2 dirra 1 pic = 1 dirra 1 gasab = 4 dirra 1 mil hachmi = 1000 dirra 1 farsakh = 3000 dirra There were six kinds of derah (a.k.a. dirra) as follows: [ 3 ] 1 Nile pic = 0.2545 m,
1 native pic (derah baladi) = 0.5682 m,
1 Constantinople pic (derah Istambuli) = 0.6691 m,
1 cloth pic (derah hendazeh) = 0.6479 m,
1 builder's pic (derah meimari) = 0.7500 m,
1 itinerary pic (aka. road-measure pic) = 0.7389 m.

Road Measures [ edit ] One itenery derah was equal to 0.7389 m.

[ 3 ] Some other units according to the metric equivalences defined in 1891 are given below: [ 1 ] [ 2 ] 1 cassaba = 5 derah 1 bââh = 2 + 1 ⁄ 2 derah 1 mili = 500 cassabas = 1.148 mile (1.847 km) 1 farsakh (league) = 3 mili
1 baride = 4 farsakh 1 safar yome (of which 2 + 1 ⁄ 2 make 1° of the meridian = 60 mili) = 2 baride .

Mass [ edit ] A number of units were used to measure mass. One oke was equal to 1.248 kg, according to the metric equivalences defined in 1891.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Some other units according to the metric equivalences defined in 1891 are given below: [ 1 ] [ 2 ] 1 kirat = 1 ⁄ 6400 oke 1 dirhem = 1 ⁄ 400 oke 1 miskal = 8 ⁄ 800 oke 1 okieh = 0.03 oke 1 rotoli = 0.36 oke 1 kantar = 36 oke [ 1 ] [ 2 ] 1 helm = 200 oke [ 1 ] [ 2 ] One harsela, used for weighing silk, is one oke.

[ 3 ] Area [ edit ] A number of units were used to measure area. One feddan was equal to 4200.8 m 2 , according to the metric equivalences defined in 1891.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Some other units according to the metric equivalences defined in 1891 are given below: [ 1 ] [ 2 ] 1 sahme = 1 ⁄ 576 feddan 1 kirat kamel = 1 ⁄ 24 feddan [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] 1 feddan masri = 1 feddan.

Squares of derah and cassaba (3.55 m) was used to partly measure lands.

[ 3 ] Capacity [ edit ] Two main systems, liquid and dry were used in Egypt.

Liquid Measure [ edit ] One guirbeh was equal to 70.4467 quarts ( 66 + 2 ⁄ 3 litres).

[ 3 ] Dry Measure [ edit ] A number of units were used to measure capacity.  One keddah was equal to 2.0625 L, according to the metric equivalences defined in 1891.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Some other units according to the metric equivalences defined in 1891 are given below: [ 1 ] [ 2 ] 1 kirat = 1 ⁄ 32 keddah 1 khanoubah = 1 ⁄ 16 keddah 1 toumnah = 1 ⁄ 8 keddah 1 robhah = 1 ⁄ 4 keddah 1 nisf keddah = 1 ⁄ 2 keddah 1 malouah = 2 keddah 1 rob (roubouh) = 4 keddah 1 keila = 8 keddah 1 ardeb = 96 keddah 1 daribah = 768 keddah Before 1891, according to the report of the United States Commissioners to the Paris Exposition of 1867, 1 ardeb was equal to 2.603 bushels (91.72 L).

[ 3 ] Other authorities give the ardeb = 5.1648 bushels.

[ 3 ] One ardeb of Alexandria was equal to 7.6907 bushels.
