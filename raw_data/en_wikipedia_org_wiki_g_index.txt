The g -index is an author-level metric suggested in 2006 by Leo Egghe.

[ 1 ] The index is calculated based on the distribution of citations received by a given researcher's publications, such that given a set of articles ranked in decreasing order of the number of citations that they received, the g -index is the unique largest number such that the top g articles received together at least g 2 citations. Hence, a g -index of 10 indicates that the top 10 publications of an author have been cited at least 100 times (10 2 ), a g -index of 20 indicates that the top 20 publications of an author have been cited 400 times (20 2 ).

It can be equivalently defined as the largest number n of highly cited articles for which the average number of citations is at least n . This is in fact a rewriting of the definition An example of a g -index (the raw citation data, plotted with stars, allows the h -index to also be extracted for comparison).

g 2 ≤ ≤ ∑ ∑ i ≤ ≤ g c i {\displaystyle g^{2}\leq \sum _{i\leq g}c_{i}} as g ≤ ≤ 1 g ∑ ∑ i ≤ ≤ g c i .

{\displaystyle g\leq {\frac {1}{g}}\sum _{i\leq g}c_{i}.} The g -index is an alternative for the older h -index . The h -index does not average the number of citations. Instead, the h -index only requires a minimum of n citations for the least-cited article in the set and thus ignores the citation count of very highly cited publications. Roughly, the effect is that h is the number of works of a quality threshold that rises as h rises; g allows citations from higher-cited works to be used to bolster lower-cited works in meeting this threshold. In effect, the g -index is the maximum reachable value of the h -index if a fixed number of citations can be distributed freely over a fixed number of publications. Therefore, in all cases g is at least h , and is in most cases higher.

[ 1 ] The g -index often separates authors based on citations to a greater extent compared to the h -index. However, unlike the h -index, the g -index saturates whenever the average number of citations for all publications exceeds the total number of publications; the way it is defined, the g -index is not adapted to this situation. However, if an author with a saturated g -index publishes more, their g -index will increase.

An example of two authors who both have 10 publications, both authors have a h -index of 6. However, Author 1 has a g-index of 10, while Author 2 has a g -index of 7.

Author 1 Author 2 Work 1 30 10 Work 2 17 9 Work 3 15 9 Work 4 13 9 Work 5 8 8 Work 6 6 6 Work 7 5 5 Work 8 4 4 Work 9 3 2 Work 10 1 1 Total cites 102 63 Average cites 10,2 6,3 The g -index has been characterized in terms of three natural axioms by Woeginger (2008).

[ 2 ] The simplest of these three axioms states that by moving citations from weaker articles to stronger articles, one's research index should not decrease. Like the h -index, the g -index is a natural number and thus lacks in discriminatory power . Therefore, Tol (2008) proposed a rational generalisation.

[ 3 ] [ clarification needed ] Tol also proposed a collective g -index.

Given a set of researchers ranked in decreasing order of their g -index, the g 1 -index is the (unique) largest number such that the top g 1 researchers have on average at least a g -index of g 1 .
