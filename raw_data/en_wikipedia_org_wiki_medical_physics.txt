**Medical physics**[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_physics#cite_note-1) deals with the application of the concepts and methods of physics to the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of human diseases with a specific goal of improving human health and well-being.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_physics#cite_note-2) Since 2008, medical physics has been included as a health profession according to [International Standard Classification of Occupation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Standard_Classification_of_Occupations "International Standard Classification of Occupations") of the [International Labour Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Labour_Organization "International Labour Organization").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_physics#cite_note-3)

Although medical physics may sometimes also be referred to as _biomedical physics_, _medical biophysics_, _applied physics in medicine_, _physics applications in medical science_, _radiological physics_ or _hospital radio-physics_, a "[medical physicist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_physicist "Medical physicist")" is specifically a health professional[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_physics#cite_note-4) with specialist education and training in the concepts and techniques of applying physics in medicine and competent to practice independently in one or more of the subfields of medical physics.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_physics#cite_note-5) Traditionally, medical physicists are found in the following healthcare specialties: [radiation oncology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_oncology "Radiation oncology") (also known as radiotherapy or radiation therapy), diagnostic and interventional [radiology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology "Radiology") (also known as medical imaging), [nuclear medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_medicine "Nuclear medicine"), and [radiation protection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_protection "Radiation protection"). Medical physics of [radiation therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy "Radiation therapy") can involve work such as [dosimetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dosimetry "Dosimetry"), [linac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_particle_accelerator "Linear particle accelerator") quality assurance, and [brachytherapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brachytherapy "Brachytherapy"). Medical physics of diagnostic and interventional [radiology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology "Radiology") involves [medical imaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging "Medical imaging") techniques such as [magnetic resonance imaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging "Magnetic resonance imaging"), [ultrasound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound "Ultrasound"), [computed tomography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CT_scan "CT scan") and [x-ray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography "Radiography"). Nuclear medicine will include [positron emission tomography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission_tomography "Positron emission tomography") and radionuclide therapy. However one can find Medical Physicists in many other areas such as physiological monitoring, audiology, neurology, neurophysiology, cardiology and others.

Medical physics departments may be found in institutions such as universities, hospitals, and laboratories. University departments are of two types. The first type are mainly concerned with preparing students for a career as a hospital Medical Physicist and research focuses on improving the practice of the profession. A second type (increasingly called 'biomedical physics') has a much wider scope and may include research in any applications of physics to medicine from the study of biomolecular structure to microscopy and nanomedicine.

 A [ribosome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosome "Ribosome") is a [biological machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_machine "Biological machine") that utilizes [protein domain dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_domain_dynamics "Protein domain dynamics"), leading [Richard Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman "Richard Feynman") to [suggest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There%27s_Plenty_of_Room_at_the_Bottom "There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom") a [medical use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanomedicine#Cell_repair_machines "Nanomedicine") for [nanophysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanophysics "Nanophysics")

Some education institutions house departments or programs bearing the title "medical biophysics" or "biomedical physics" or "applied physics in medicine". Generally, these fall into one of two categories: interdisciplinary departments that house [biophysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biophysics "Biophysics"), [radiobiology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiobiology "Radiobiology"), and medical physics under a single umbrella;[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_physics#cite_note-8)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_physics#cite_note-9)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_physics#cite_note-10) and undergraduate programs that prepare students for further study in medical physics, biophysics, or medicine.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_physics#cite_note-11)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_physics#cite_note-12) Most of the scientific concepts in bionanotechnology are derived from other fields. Biochemical principles that are used to understand the material properties of biological systems are central in bionanotechnology because those same principles are to be used to create new technologies.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] Material properties and applications studied in bionanoscience include mechanical properties (e.g. deformation, adhesion, failure), electrical/electronic (e.g. electromechanical stimulation, [capacitors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacitors "Capacitors"), energy storage/batteries), optical (e.g. absorption, [luminescence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminescence "Luminescence"), [photochemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photochemistry "Photochemistry")), thermal (e.g. thermomutability, thermal management), biological (e.g. how cells interact with nanomaterials, molecular flaws/defects, biosensing, biological mechanisms such as [mechanosensation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanosensation "Mechanosensation")), nanoscience of disease (e.g. genetic disease, cancer, organ/tissue failure), as well as computing (e.g. [DNA computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_computing "DNA computing")) and agriculture (target delivery of pesticides, hormones and fertilizers.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_physics#cite_note-GarciaAnoveros-13)[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_physics#cite_note-pmid28285124-14)[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_physics#cite_note-15)[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_physics#cite_note-16)

### Medical imaging physics

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Medical_physics&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Medical imaging physics")]

[![Image 2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Parasagittal_MRI_of_human_head_in_patient_with_benign_familial_macrocephaly_prior_to_brain_injury_%28ANIMATED%29.gif/250px-Parasagittal_MRI_of_human_head_in_patient_with_benign_familial_macrocephaly_prior_to_brain_injury_%28ANIMATED%29.gif)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Parasagittal_MRI_of_human_head_in_patient_with_benign_familial_macrocephaly_prior_to_brain_injury_(ANIMATED).gif)

Para-sagittal MRI of the head in a patient with benign familial macrocephaly.

Medical imaging physics is also known as diagnostic and interventional radiology physics. Clinical (both "in-house" and "consulting") physicists[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_physics#cite_note-19) typically deal with areas of testing, optimization, and quality assurance of [diagnostic radiology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_radiology "Diagnostic radiology") physics areas such as radiographic [X-rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray "X-ray"), [fluoroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoroscopy "Fluoroscopy"), [mammography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammography "Mammography"), [angiography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography "Angiography"), and [computed tomography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computed_tomography "Computed tomography"), as well as [non-ionizing radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-ionizing_radiation "Non-ionizing radiation") modalities such as [ultrasound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound "Ultrasound"), and [MRI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging "Magnetic resonance imaging"). They may also be engaged with radiation protection issues such as [dosimetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dosimetry "Dosimetry") (for staff and patients). In addition, many imaging physicists are often also involved with [nuclear medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_medicine "Nuclear medicine") systems, including [single photon emission computed tomography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPECT "SPECT") (SPECT) and [positron emission tomography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission_tomography "Positron emission tomography") (PET). Sometimes, imaging physicists may be engaged in clinical areas, but for research and teaching purposes,[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_physics#cite_note-20) such as quantifying [intravascular ultrasound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravascular_ultrasound "Intravascular ultrasound") as a possible method of imaging a particular vascular object.

### Therapeutic medical physics

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Medical_physics&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Therapeutic medical physics")]

Radiation therapeutic physics is also known as [radiotherapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiotherapy "Radiotherapy") physics or [radiation oncologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_oncologist "Radiation oncologist") physics. The majority of medical physicists currently working in the US, Canada, and some western countries are of this group. A radiation therapy physicist typically deals with [linear accelerator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_particle_accelerator#Medical_linacs "Linear particle accelerator") (Linac) systems and kilovoltage x-ray treatment units on a daily basis, as well as other modalities such as [TomoTherapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TomoTherapy "TomoTherapy"), [gamma knife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_knife "Gamma knife"), [Cyberknife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberknife_(device) "Cyberknife (device)"), [proton therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_therapy "Proton therapy"), and [brachytherapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brachytherapy "Brachytherapy").[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_physics#cite_note-21)[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_physics#cite_note-22)[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_physics#cite_note-23) The academic and research side of therapeutic physics may encompass fields such as [boron neutron capture therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boron_neutron_capture_therapy "Boron neutron capture therapy"), [sealed source radiotherapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sealed_source_radiotherapy "Sealed source radiotherapy"), [terahertz radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terahertz_radiation "Terahertz radiation"), high-intensity focused [ultrasound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound "Ultrasound") (including [lithotripsy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithotriptor "Lithotriptor")), [optical radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_radiation "Optical radiation")[lasers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser "Laser"), [ultraviolet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet "Ultraviolet") etc. including [photodynamic therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photodynamic_therapy "Photodynamic therapy"), as well as [nuclear medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_medicine "Nuclear medicine") including [unsealed source radiotherapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsealed_source_radiotherapy "Unsealed source radiotherapy"), and [photomedicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photomedicine "Photomedicine"), which is the use of light to treat and diagnose disease.

### Nuclear medicine physics

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Medical_physics&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Nuclear medicine physics")]

[Nuclear medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_medicine "Nuclear medicine") is a branch of medicine that uses radiation to provide information about the functioning of a person's specific organs or to treat disease. The [thyroid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid "Thyroid"), [bones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone "Bone"), [heart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart "Heart"), [liver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver "Liver") and many other organs can be easily imaged, and disorders in their function revealed. In some cases radiation sources can be [used to treat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsealed_source_radiotherapy "Unsealed source radiotherapy") diseased organs, or tumours. Five [Nobel laureates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nobel_laureates "List of Nobel laureates") have been intimately involved with the use of radioactive tracers in medicine. Over 10,000 hospitals worldwide use [radioisotopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioisotope "Radioisotope") in medicine, and about 90% of the procedures are for diagnosis. The most common radioisotope used in diagnosis is [technetium-99m](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technetium-99m "Technetium-99m"), with some 30 million procedures per year, accounting for 80% of all nuclear medicine procedures worldwide.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_physics#cite_note-24)

Health physics is also known as radiation safety or [radiation protection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_protection "Radiation protection"). Health physics is the applied physics of radiation protection for health and health care purposes. It is the science concerned with the recognition, evaluation, and control of health hazards to permit the safe use and application of ionizing radiation. Health physics professionals promote excellence in the science and practice of radiation protection and safety.

### Physiological measurement

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Medical_physics&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Physiological measurement")]

Physiological measurements have also been used to monitor and measure various physiological parameters. Many physiological measurement techniques are [non-invasive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-invasive "Non-invasive") and can be used in conjunction with, or as an alternative to, other [invasive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_(medical) "Invasive (medical)") methods. Measurement methods include [electrocardiography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiography "Electrocardiography") Many of these areas may be covered by other specialities, for example [medical engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_engineering "Medical engineering") or vascular science.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_physics#cite_note-25)
