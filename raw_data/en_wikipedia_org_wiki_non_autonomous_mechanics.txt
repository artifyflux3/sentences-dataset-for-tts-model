In particular, this is the case of mechanical systems whose Lagrangians and Hamiltonians depend on the time. The configuration space of non-autonomous mechanics is a fiber bundle Q → → R {\displaystyle Q\to \mathbb {R} } over the time axis R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } coordinated by ( t , q i ) {\displaystyle (t,q^{i})} .

This bundle is trivial, but its different trivializations Q = R × × M {\displaystyle Q=\mathbb {R} \times M} correspond to the choice of different non-relativistic reference frames. Such a reference frame also is represented by a connection Γ Γ {\displaystyle \Gamma } on Q → → R {\displaystyle Q\to \mathbb {R} } which takes a form Γ Γ i = 0 {\displaystyle \Gamma ^{i}=0} with respect to this trivialization. The corresponding covariant differential ( q t i − − Γ Γ i ) ∂ ∂ i {\displaystyle (q_{t}^{i}-\Gamma ^{i})\partial _{i}} determines the relative velocity with respect to a reference frame Γ Γ {\displaystyle \Gamma } .

As a consequence, non-autonomous mechanics (in particular, non-autonomous Hamiltonian mechanics) can be formulated as a covariant classical field theory (in particular covariant Hamiltonian field theory ) on X = R {\displaystyle X=\mathbb {R} } . Accordingly, the velocity phase space of non-autonomous mechanics is the jet manifold J 1 Q {\displaystyle J^{1}Q} of Q → → R {\displaystyle Q\to \mathbb {R} } provided with the coordinates ( t , q i , q t i ) {\displaystyle (t,q^{i},q_{t}^{i})} . Its momentum phase space is the vertical cotangent bundle V Q {\displaystyle VQ} of Q → → R {\displaystyle Q\to \mathbb {R} } coordinated by ( t , q i , p i ) {\displaystyle (t,q^{i},p_{i})} and endowed with the canonical Poisson structure . The dynamics of Hamiltonian non-autonomous mechanics is defined by a Hamiltonian form p i d q i − − H ( t , q i , p i ) d t {\displaystyle p_{i}dq^{i}-H(t,q^{i},p_{i})dt} .

One can associate to any Hamiltonian non-autonomous system an equivalent Hamiltonian autonomous system on the cotangent bundle T Q {\displaystyle TQ} of Q {\displaystyle Q} coordinated by ( t , q i , p , p i ) {\displaystyle (t,q^{i},p,p_{i})} and provided with the canonical symplectic form ; its Hamiltonian is p − − H {\displaystyle p-H} .
