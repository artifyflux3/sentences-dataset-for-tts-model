In general [ edit ] Human Human condition Individuality (selfhood) – state or quality of being an individual; particularly of being a person separate from other persons and possessing his or her own needs or goals, rights and responsibilities. The exact definition of an individual is important in the fields of biology, law, and philosophy.

Person – being that has certain capacities or attributes such as reason, morality, consciousness or self-consciousness, and being a part of a culturally established form of social relations such as kinship, ownership of property, or legal responsibility.

Personhood – status of being a person. Defining personhood is a controversial topic in philosophy and law and is closely tied with legal and political concepts of citizenship, equality, and liberty. According to law, only a natural person or legal personality has rights, protections, privileges, responsibilities, and legal liability.

These rights vary from culture to culture, and by very definition, from person to person, and appear mainly in individualist societies. In considering the self, the most intimate legal relation would be what is codified as ' sui juris ', or what laws have a purposed place so far as they are derived of the self.  In such cultures, it is generally considered that each and every individual has the following rights: Security rights – protect people against crimes such as abuse , murder, massacre, and torture Security of person – liberty, including the right, if one is imprisoned unlawfully, to the remedy of habeas corpus. Security of person can also be seen as an expansion of rights based on prohibitions of torture and cruel and unusual punishment. Rights to security of person can guard against less lethal conduct, and can be used in regard to prisoners' rights.

Bodily and property rights – encompass "ownership" of your own body and choosing what to do with it, as well as the fruits of the labour that spring forth from using your own body. ("Every man has a property in his own person. This nobody has a right to, but himself," per John Locke , Second Treatise on Civil Government ) Self-ownership – moral or natural right of a person to have bodily integrity, and be the exclusive controller of his own body and life. Also known as "sovereignty of the individual", "individual sovereignty", and "individual autonomy".

Liberty rights of the Classical era – protect freedoms in areas such as belief and religion , association , assembling , movement , and other self-determination (as an individual person), privacy from government and others, and freedoms from other paternalist meddling generally, whether by governments or others; also encompasses security, bodily and property, political, and due process rights, many group rights, some welfare rights, and (especially outside of the US in the Classical era) equality rights, as all of those categories appear in this list Political rights – protect the liberty to participate in politics by expressing themselves , protesting, voting and serving in public office Due process rights – protect against abuses of the legal system such as imprisonment without trial, secret trials and excessive punishments; often overlaps with the bodily rights, listed above Equality rights – guarantee equal citizenship, equality before the law and nondiscrimination in regards to one's eligibility for all of the other rights in this list Welfare rights (also known as economic or social rights) – require the provision of education and protections against severe poverty and starvation ; generally an expansion of positive liberties Group rights – provide protection for groups against ethnic genocide , and self-determination (as a group) and the ownership by countries of their national territories and resources; may overlap with the bodily and property rights, and Social equality rights, listed above Other personal concepts [ edit ] Ability Aptitude Attitude Behavior Competence Character traits Chronotype Early bird Night owl Common sense Communication skills Duty Everyday life Egocentrism Egoism Emotional intelligence Ethics Good and evil Freedom (philosophy) Freedom (political) Free will Harm principle Human sexual behavior Human sexuality Humanism Improvement Individualism Individuality Individuation Interest Intrapersonal communication Justice Liberty Lifestyle ( List ) Lifestyle disease Luck Meaning of life Morality Occupational disease Ownership Parenting People skills Personal boundaries Personal income Personal life Note-taking Personal property Personal space Personal time Philosophy Privacy Property Proxemics Psychological stress Public Reputation Self-talk Self-schema Self-worth Social influence Social intelligence Soft skills Study skills Subjectivity Success Taste (aesthetics) Taste (sociology) Temperament Thought Transhumanism See also [ edit ] Collaboration Cosmos Cosmology Externality List of cognitive biases Outline of social science Rite of passage Social behavior Trade-off v t e Wikipedia outlines General reference Culture and the arts Geography and places Health and fitness History and events Mathematics and logic Natural and physical sciences People and self Philosophy and thinking Religion and belief systems Society and social sciences Technology and applied sciences NewPP limit report
