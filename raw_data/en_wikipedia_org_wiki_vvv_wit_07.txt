The star, located in the Scorpius constellation about 23,000 ly (7,100 pc) away, [ 1 ] is not a binary star , which would eliminate such a system from explaining the various observed dimmings.

[ 3 ] Overview [ edit ] A light curve for VVV-WIT-07, adapted from Saito et al.

(2019).

[ 1 ] The inset plot shows the July 2012 dimming event with an expanded scale.

The star was found by the " Vista Variables in the Via Lactea " (VVV) project, which is a survey of European Southern Observatory (ESO) variability of the innermost bulge of the Milky Way galaxy . The near-infrared spectra of VVV-WIT-07 appear without features, without prominent emission or absorption lines. The characteristics found in the light curve of VVV-WIT-07 (WIT refers to "What Is This?") are similar to those seen in J1407 ( Mamajek's Object ), a pre-MS K5 dwarf with a ring system that eclipses the star or, alternatively, to Tabby's star , an F3 IV/V star that shows irregular and aperiodic obscurations in its light curve.

[ 1 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 3 ] From 2010 to 2018, the star dimmed and brightened irregularly (v~14.35 – 16.164), [ 1 ] and seemed similar to Tabby's star , except the light from VVV-WIT-07 dimmed by up to 80 percent, while Tabby's star faded by only about 20 percent.

[ 8 ] Another star, J1407 , however, has been found to have dimmed by up to 95%, which may be more similar to the light curve presented by VVV-WIT-07.

[ 8 ] Nonetheless, according to ESO astronomer Valentin Ivanov, "A key word that could be used to describe our finding [of VVV-WIT-07] is extreme. In every aspect ... We have identified a system that challenges the imagination even more than usual, because it is so unlike our own planetary system."
