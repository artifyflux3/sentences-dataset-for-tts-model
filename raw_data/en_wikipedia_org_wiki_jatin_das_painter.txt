Pankha: hand fans of the Indian subcontinent [ edit ] 28 years ago Jatin Das began a collection of pankha (hand fans). This now numbers over 6,000 fans and related objects, the majority from the Indian subcontinent. Since May 2004, sections of the collection have been on display at eminent museums in India and overseas. The inaugural show at the National Crafts Museum, Delhi, was followed by exhibitions at the Victoria Memorial; Calcutta, Fan Museum; London, National Art Gallery; Kuala Lumpur, Reitberg Museum; Zurich and National Museum; Manila. The collection will eventually be housed in a dedicated museum in New Delhi.
A book on the subject, ‘To Stir the Still Air’, is being published by Mapin International.

[ citation needed ] Overstaying in govt accommodation [ edit ] In 2015, around 24 artists including Jatin Das have been issued notices for staying for decades in government flats that were originally allotted only for three years.

[ 5 ] Misconduct Accusation [ edit ] In 2018, Nisha Bora accused him of sexual misconduct in 2004 when she went to meet the painter at his studio he tried to grope her and forcefully kiss her on the lips.

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] The artist has denied the accusation.

Later another woman, Garusha Katoch, also accused Das of inappropriate behaviour. Anushree Majumdar, journalist with the Indian Express, also shared a disturbing instance with him.

[ 9 ] However, Das firmly denies these allegations. No formal complaint has been filed to date.

[ 10 ] In total, eleven women came forward with Jatin Das’s sexual misconduct. Given his privileged background, not much has been done legally.
