Established in 1894, it is part of the University of Wisconsin System . UW-Stevens Point grants associate, baccalaureate, and master's degrees, as well as doctoral degrees in audiology, educational sustainability, and physical therapy. The 406-acre (164 ha) main campus includes the 280-acre (113 ha) Schmeeckle Reserve, 15 academic buildings, and 13 residence halls.

[ 3 ] UWSP also has two branch campuses located in Wausau and Marshfield .

UW-Stevens Point is organized into four colleges with more than 170 undergraduate programs in 80 majors and 90 minors and 18 graduate programs.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] UW-Stevens Point has a long history of pioneering new educational fields. UWSP was one of the first schools in the US to educate young women in “domestic science” or home economics, the first university in the US to offer a major in environmental conservation, and the first in the world to offer wellness as a college degree program.

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] The UW-Stevens Point Pointers compete in 14 intercollegiate sports in NCAA Division III and have won 13 championships.

[ 9 ] History [ edit ] Establishment [ edit ] The Wisconsin State Constitution, ratified in 1848, called for a state university as well as a teacher training department in that school. Thus, the University of Wisconsin-Madison was established, yet a teacher training department did not start officially till 1856. In 1857 a Normal School Board of Regents was established to allocate funds to institutions in the state that supported teacher training. Madison's teacher training program (called the Normal Department) separated and rejoined the university twice (1860 and 1863) due to fluctuating Civil War-era interest in teacher education. After a final 1868 split, limited funds furnished to universities that provided teacher education meant many did not invest in this field. The solution identified by the Normal School Board of Regents was to establish Normal Schools around the state for the sole purpose of teacher education. The first regional Normal Schools were established in 1866 in Platteville and Whitewater .

[ 10 ] An early drawing of the campus In 1891, the Board of Regents authorized the establishment of a sixth normal school to serve the northern half of the state. Many cities wished to have the normal school, but the ultimate contenders were Stevens Point and Wausau. On July 21st, 1893 at 3 p.m. the Board of Regents voted for the site. Shortly after midnight, a telegram from Madison confirmed that Stevens Point was the home of the new normal school.

[ 10 ] After securing land and funding from the City of Stevens Point and Portage County and winning the right to host the new normal school , Stevens Point Normal School opened on September 17, 1894, with 201 students. In addition to teacher preparation, "domestic science" ( home economics ) and conservation education were offered; the latter formed the basis for the College of Natural Resources.

[ 10 ] The Board of Regents selected Theron B. Pray as the first President of the University and allowed the hiring of 12 more faculty members.

[ 10 ] 20th century to present [ edit ] Old Main as seen in 1917 with both wings added Early 20th-century enrollment growth spurred campus expansion, including west and east wings added to Old Main in 1901 and 1914 respectively, and a domestic science cottage named Sims Cottage in 1915. In 1913, the state authorized the first dormitory in the normal school system, Nelson Hall , completed in 1915. The Orthman Rural Demonstration School was built in 1923, and a training school, now the Communication Arts Center, was approved in 1926. The domestic science cottage and the rural demonstration school were both demolished in the 1950s.

[ 11 ] In 1927, Stevens Point Normal School became Central State Teachers College , offering four-year degrees. Peter J. Michelsen developed the music program starting in 1931, with the first bachelor of music degree in the state college system approved in 1959. In 1946, a conservation education major, the first in the U.S., was established which eventually developed into the College of Natural Resources.

[ 11 ] When post- World War II enrollment became less centered on teacher training and more focused on liberal arts education, the Wisconsin State Legislature intervened, changing the school's name in 1951 to Wisconsin State College–Stevens Point with the authority to grant bachelor of arts and bachelor of science degrees. In the same year, the College of Letters and Science was established.

[ 11 ] The 1950s and 1960s saw significant construction due to increased enrollment, and the institution became Wisconsin State University–Stevens Point in 1964, offering graduate degrees, with the College of Fine Arts also established that year. In 1967, a student "beer riot" occurred in response to potential legal drinking age changes, which included a bonfire downtown and looting of a beer truck. In 1968, the Northwoods battalion ROTC unit was formed. In 1969, an International Studies program, the first in the university system, was established. Student protests against the Vietnam War included a Nelson Hall "sit-in" in 1970. The College of Natural Resources and the College of Professional Studies were also created in 1970. In 1971, the school became part of the University of Wisconsin system, adopting its current name.

[ 11 ] In 1974, Lee S. Dreyfus began his tenure as chancellor, a position he held until his election as Wisconsin's governor, an honor he celebrated with his 1979 inauguration on Old Main's front lawn.

[ 11 ] The university expanded its reach in 1985 with the establishment of the Treehaven field station.

[ 11 ] A unique moment in the campus's history occurred in 1995, when the Jacksonville Jaguars , as part of the 'Cheese League', conducted their training camp on campus.

[ 12 ] As the 21st century approached, the university demonstrated a growing commitment to environmental stewardship, forming a sustainability task force in 2007 with the goal of achieving carbon neutrality . However, the university also faced challenges, including the 2009 resignation of Chancellor Linda Bunnell following a student vote of no-confidence stemming from a reported automobile accident and allegations of driving under the influence.

[ 13 ] More recently, in 2022, the university's commitment to ecological education was bolstered by the donation of an 11-acre property, which became the Bob Engelhard Restoration Ecology Field Laboratory.

[ 19 ] UW-Stevens Point also has two additional campuses.

UW-Stevens Point at Wausau and UW-Stevens Point at Marshfield . The UW-Stevens Point at Marshfield campus was formed in 1963 and is 114-acres in a quiet residential area. The UW-Stevens Point at Wausau campus was formed in 1933 and is located in an urban area.

[ 3 ] Satellite locations [ edit ] The university has three off-site field stations: Central Wisconsin Environmental Station (CWES) at Amherst Junction, Treehaven near Tomahawk, and the Northern Aquaculture Demonstration Facility at Bayfield. CWES is on 200 acres near Sunset Lake, 17 miles east of Stevens Point. Treehaven is between Tomahawk and Rhinelander, Wisconsin on 1,400 acres. The Northern Aquaculture Demonstration Facility is at 36445 State Highway 13, 1.5 miles west of Red Cliff on Highway 13, near Lake Superior.

[ 20 ] [ 21 ] Old Main [ edit ] Old Main is the icon of the campus. It is the oldest building on campus, constructed in 1894. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places .

The iconic cupola atop the "Old Main" building is the current logo for the university. Built in 1894, it was the first building on campus.

[ 22 ] It was designed by Dwight H. Perkins of Perkins and Selby of Chicago in the Renaissance Revival Style, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places .

[ 22 ] [ 23 ] It currently houses University Administration.

[ 24 ] In 1901, a west wing was added to the building to house home economics, the Rural Education Department, and the Music Department. In 1914, an east wing was added to the building to relocate home economics.

[ 22 ] In 1971, the University's Bureau of Facilities Management deemed Old Main as "obsolete", recommending its demolition. There were multiple efforts to save the building from demolition, including listing Old Main on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. In 1979 the University was awarded funds to modernize the interior and remove both the east and west wings, thus saving Old Main. A formal rededication was held in October 1980.

[ 22 ] Nelson Hall [ edit ] Nelson Hall, constructed in 1915, is the second oldest building on campus. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places .

Nelson Hall is the third oldest building on campus and the second oldest still standing. Built in 1915 and designed by the Milwaukee firm of Henry Van Ryn and Gerrit de Gellecke, it is listed on the National Register of Historic Places . Since it was built, the residence has housed women students, the Student Army Training Corps organizing for World War I, trainees for World War II and the ROTC.

[ 25 ] Nelson Hall remains as the oldest existing dormitory building of the former State Normal School system .

[ 26 ] [ 27 ] Nelson Hall is named for George B. Nelson who, at the time, was a regent of the State Normal School System. Nelson fought with legislators who were opposed to spending the $100,000 to build the hall.

[ 25 ] Museums [ edit ] The UW-Stevens Point campus is home to the Olson Museum of Natural History. The earliest mention of a museum at UWSP goes back to the founding of the campus and the construction of the Normal School Old Main Building in 1894. Currently, the museum is divided into 10 areas of natural history: Anthropology, Botany, Entomology, Geology, Herpetology, Ichthyology, Mammalogy, Ornithology, Parasitology, and Paleontology. A Noteworthy specimen includes the only Wisconsin fossil of the extinct elk-moose ( Cervalces scotii ) found by a farmer in Bevent.

[ 28 ] [ 29 ] In 2024, the museum was renamed the Olson Museum of Natural History in honor of Don and Judi Olson, an alumni couple who donated $450,000 to the museum.

[ 30 ] Many of UW-Stevens Point's collections are among the most heavily utilized teaching and research collections in the state.

[ 31 ] [ 32 ] The campus also holds the Edna Carlsten Art Gallery which exhibits local, national, and international artists, hosts community events, and contributes to overseeing and maintaining a permanent collection of fine art and design works.

[ 33 ] Native American history [ edit ] The UW-Stevens Point campus currently sits atop a Native American burial site. Recently, historic research showed the campus encompasses what was at one point a Native American camp and burial ground of the Ho-Chunk, Menominee, Ojibwe and Potawatomi. In the 1860s, scarlet fever devastated a diverse group of Native Americans who were living outside of Stevens Point after being forced out of their ancestral homelands by settlement. The deceased were buried on this site.
