[ 6 ] Standardization of grammar [ edit ] Shukraraj Shastri's grammar book published in 1928.

Sukraraj Shastri published the first grammar book in Nepal Bhasa (in N.S.

1048, Kaulaathwa 10) called "Nepalbhasa byakaran".

[ 7 ] Before that, grammar was limited to manuscripts and traditional teachings with wide variability. This publication initiated a standardization of grammar. Publication of Nepal Bhasa reader aided in further standardization of vocabulary.

[ 8 ] Translation [ edit ] To increase the literary treasure of the language, translations of various literature was initiated in this era. Some of them are as follows Lalitvistara , a Sanskrit Buddhist text based on the Buddha's life story was translated by Nisthananda Bajracharya, one of the four pillars of Nepal Bhasa during this era.

[ 6 ] Poet Yogbir Singh Kansakar stressed female education.

[ 6 ] Research [ edit ] Scientific research on the language began in this period. It was identified that Nepal Bhasa is a Sino-Tibetan language and not an Indo-Aryan language (as was believed) in this era.

987-N.S.1050) read as follows [ 12 ] सज्जन मनुष्या संगतनं मूर्ख नापं भिना वै पलेला लपते ल वंसा म्वति थें ल सना वै which state that even a moron can improve with the company of good people just like even a drop of water appears like a pearl when it descends upon the leaves of a lotus plant.

Impact [ edit ] Much of the literary activities conducted in modern era were a propagation of the activities initiated in this era. The era created a new breed of modern writers. Unlike medieval era or dark era writers, these writers were commoners and not aristocrats. Hence, literature reached the grass-roots level of society. Some of the most prominent impacts of the activities of this era are The epic Sugata Saurabha by Chittadhar Hridaya [ 13 ] is the greatest epic written in the language along the lines of Nisthananda Bajracharya.
