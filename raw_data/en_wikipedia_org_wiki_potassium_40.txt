Its half-life is 1.25 billion years. It makes up about 0.012% (120 ppm ) of natural potassium, making that mixture very weakly radioactive.

Potassium-40 undergoes four different types of radioactive decay , including all three main types of beta decay : Electron emission (β − ) to 40 Ca with a decay energy of 1.31 MeV at 89.6% probability Electron capture (EC) to 40 Ar * followed by a gamma decay emitting a photon [ Note 1 ] with an energy of 1.46 MeV at 10.3% probability Direct electron capture (EC) to the ground state of 40 Ar at 0.1% probability [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Positron emission (β + ) to 40 Ar at 0.001% probability [ 4 ] Both forms of the electron capture decay release further photons, [ Note 2 ] when electrons from the outer shells fall into the inner shells to replace the electron taken from there.

The EC decay of 40 K explains the large abundance of argon (nearly 1%) in the Earth's atmosphere , as well as prevalence of 40 Ar over other isotopes .

Potassium–argon dating [ edit ] Decay scheme Main article: K–Ar dating Potassium-40 is especially important in potassium–argon (K–Ar) dating. Argon is a gas that does not ordinarily combine with other elements. So, when a mineral forms – whether from molten rock , or from substances dissolved in water – it will be initially argon-free, even if there is some argon in the liquid. However, if the mineral contains traces of potassium, then decay of the 40 K isotope present will create fresh argon-40 that will remain locked up in the mineral. Since the rate at which this conversion occurs is known, it is possible to determine the elapsed time since the mineral formed by measuring the ratio of 40 K and 40 Ar atoms contained in it.

The argon found in Earth's atmosphere is 99.6% 40 Ar; whereas the argon in the Sun – and presumably in the primordial material that condensed into the planets – is mostly 36 Ar , with less than 15% of 38 Ar. It follows that most of Earth's argon derives from potassium-40 that decayed into argon-40, which eventually escaped to the atmosphere.

Contribution to natural radioactivity [ edit ] The evolution of Earth's mantle radiogenic heat flow over time: contribution from 40 K in yellow.

The decay of 40 K in Earth's mantle ranks third, after 232 Th and 238 U , in the list of sources of radiogenic heat . Less is known about the amount of radiogenic sources in Earth's outer and inner core, which lie below the mantle. It has been proposed, though, that significant core radioactivity (1–2 TW) may be caused by high levels of U, Th and K.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] Potassium-40 is the largest source of natural radioactivity in animals including humans. A 70 kg human body contains about 140 g of potassium, hence about 140g × 0.0117% ≈ 16.4 mg of 40 K; [ 7 ] whose decay produces about 3850 [ 8 ] to 4300 disintegrations per second ( becquerel ) continuously throughout the life of an adult person (and proportionally less in young children).

[ Note 3 ] [ 9 ] Banana equivalent dose [ edit ] Potassium-40 is famous for its usage in the banana equivalent dose , an informal unit of measure, primarily used in general educational settings, to compare radioactive dosages to the amount received by consuming one banana . The radioactive dosage from consuming one banana is around 10 −7 sievert , or 0.1 microsievert, under the assumptions that all of the radiation produced by potassium-40 is absorbed in the body (which is mostly true, as the majority of the radiation is beta-minus radiation, which has a short range) and that the biological half-life of potassium-40 is around 30 days (which is likely too large an estimate, as the body controls potassium levels closely and emits excess potassium quickly through urine). At the estimated 0.1 μSv, one banana equivalent dose is around 1% of the average American's daily exposure to radiation.

[ 10 ] See also [ edit ] Background radiation Isotopes of potassium Notes [ edit ] ^ Also called a gamma ray , because it is produced by a transition in the nucleus ^ Also called X-rays , as they are emitted from transitions of electrons ^ The number of radioactive decays per second in a given mass of 40 K is the number of atoms in that mass, divided by the average lifetime of a 40 K atom in seconds. The number of atoms in one gram of 40 K is the Avogadro constant 6.022 × 10 23 mol −1 divided by the atomic weight of potassium-40 (39.96 g/mol): about 1.507 × 10 22 per gram. As in any exponential decay , the average lifetime is the half-life divided by the natural logarithm of 2, or about 56.82 × 10 15 seconds.
