Lambton , and Bernard Lewis . It was reprinted in 1977 with amendments and each volume divided into two for ease of use. It was replaced by the six-volume New Cambridge History of Islam in 2010.

[ 2 ] Aims and reception [ edit ] The work was designed for undergraduate and graduate students who wanted an authoritative account of the history of Islam, and for the intelligent layman who enjoyed history. The editors also hoped that it would appeal to the "expert orientalist" and would be used for continuous reading rather than as a work of reference.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] Reviewers agreed that the history was solid but unexciting with a generally cautious approach and lack of analysis, typical they felt, of the multi-authored history that represented a distillation of the consensus in a field rather than one that sought to explore new avenues of enquiry.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] Volumes [ edit ] All volumes edited by Peter Holt, Ann K.S. Lambton, and Bernard Lewis.
