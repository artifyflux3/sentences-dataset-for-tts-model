It states that the nontrivial zeros of all automorphic L -functions lie on the critical line 1 2 + i t {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}+it} with t {\displaystyle t} a real number variable and i {\displaystyle i} the imaginary unit .

The modified grand Riemann hypothesis is the assertion that the nontrivial zeros of all automorphic L -functions lie on the critical line or the real line .

Notes [ edit ] Robert Langlands , in his general functoriality conjectures , asserts that all global L -functions should be automorphic.

[ 1 ] The Siegel zero , conjectured not to exist, [ 2 ] is a possible real zero of a Dirichlet L -series , rather near s = 1.

L -functions of Maass cusp forms can have trivial zeros which are off the real line.

Conrey and Iwaniec show that sufficiently many small gaps between zeros of the Riemann zeta function would imply the non-existence of Landau–Siegel zeros.
