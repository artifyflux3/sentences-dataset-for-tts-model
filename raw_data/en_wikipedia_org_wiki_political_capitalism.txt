capitalism [ 1 ] or Politically oriented capitalism is a concept introduced by Max Weber in his 1921 book Economy and Society to describe monetary profit-making through non-market means.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] In 2018, Holcombe describes political capitalism as an economic system in which the sharp distinction between states and markets is blurred.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] Robert Brenner and Dylan Riley have characterized the post-1990 economy of United States as political capitalism, where raw 'political power' rather than 'productive investment' is the "key determinant of rate of return ".

[ 9 ] Filippa Chatzistavrou broadens the concept of political capitalism applied in the digital age by pushing further the idea of states and high tech markets being co-constitutive in order to include not only rent seeking , property rights’ issues and surplus extraction mechanisms, but also models of governance .

[ 10 ] Background [ edit ] The definition of capitalism as an economic system based on monetary profit-making rather than a subsistence economy is shared by Max Weber and Fernand Braudel .
