( May 2025 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) In game theory and in particular the study of Blotto games and operational research , the Gibbs lemma is a result that is useful in maximization problems.

[ 1 ] It is named for Josiah Willard Gibbs .

Consider ϕ ϕ = ∑ ∑ i = 1 n f i ( x i ) {\displaystyle \phi =\sum _{i=1}^{n}f_{i}(x_{i})} . Suppose ϕ ϕ {\displaystyle \phi } is maximized,  subject to ∑ ∑ x i = X {\displaystyle \sum x_{i}=X} and x i ≥ ≥ 0 {\displaystyle x_{i}\geq 0} , at x 0 = ( x 1 0 , … … , x n 0 ) {\displaystyle x^{0}=(x_{1}^{0},\ldots ,x_{n}^{0})} . If the f i {\displaystyle f_{i}} are differentiable , then the Gibbs lemma states that there exists a λ λ {\displaystyle \lambda } such that f i ′ ( x i 0 ) = λ λ if x i 0 > 0 ≤ ≤ λ λ if x i 0 = 0.

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}f'_{i}(x_{i}^{0})&=\lambda {\mbox{ if }}x_{i}^{0}>0\\&\leq \lambda {\mbox{ if }}x_{i}^{0}=0.\end{aligned}}} Notes [ edit ] ^ J. M. Danskin (6 December 2012).
