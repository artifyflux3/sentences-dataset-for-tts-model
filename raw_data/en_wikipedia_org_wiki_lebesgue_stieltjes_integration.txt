The Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral is the ordinary Lebesgue integral with respect to a measure known as the Lebesgue–Stieltjes measure, which may be associated to any function of bounded variation on the real line.  The Lebesgue–Stieltjes measure is a regular Borel measure , and conversely every regular Borel measure on the real line is of this kind.

Lebesgue–Stieltjes integrals , named for Henri Leon Lebesgue and Thomas Joannes Stieltjes , are also known as Lebesgue–Radon integrals or just Radon integrals , after Johann Radon , to whom much of the theory is due.  They find common application in probability and stochastic processes , and in certain branches of analysis including potential theory .

Definition [ edit ] The Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral ∫ ∫ a b f ( x ) d g ( x ) {\displaystyle \int _{a}^{b}f(x)\,dg(x)} is defined when f : [ a , b ] → → R {\displaystyle f:\left[a,b\right]\rightarrow \mathbb {R} } is Borel - measurable and bounded and g : [ a , b ] → → R {\displaystyle g:\left[a,b\right]\rightarrow \mathbb {R} } is of bounded variation in [ a , b ] and right-continuous, or when f is non-negative and g is monotone and right-continuous . To start, assume that f is non-negative and g is monotone non-decreasing and right-continuous. Define w (( s , t ]) = g ( t ) − g ( s ) and w ({ a }) = 0 (Alternatively, the construction works for g left-continuous, w ([ s , t )) = g ( t ) − g ( s ) and w ({ b }) = 0 ).

By Carathéodory's extension theorem , there is a unique Borel measure μ g on [ a , b ] which agrees with w on every interval I .  The measure μ g arises from an outer measure (in fact, a metric outer measure ) given by μ μ g ( E ) = inf { ∑ ∑ i μ μ g ( I i ) : E ⊆ ⊆ ⋃ ⋃ i I i } {\displaystyle \mu _{g}(E)=\inf \left\{\sum _{i}\mu _{g}(I_{i})\ :\ E\subseteq \bigcup _{i}I_{i}\right\}} the infimum taken over all coverings of E by countably many semiopen intervals. This measure is sometimes called [ 1 ] the Lebesgue–Stieltjes measure associated with g .

The Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral ∫ ∫ a b f ( x ) d g ( x ) {\displaystyle \int _{a}^{b}f(x)\,dg(x)} is defined as the Lebesgue integral of f with respect to the measure μ g in the usual way. If g is non-increasing, then define ∫ ∫ a b f ( x ) d g ( x ) := − − ∫ ∫ a b f ( x ) d ( − − g ) ( x ) , {\displaystyle \int _{a}^{b}f(x)\,dg(x):=-\int _{a}^{b}f(x)\,d(-g)(x),} the latter integral being defined by the preceding construction.

If g is of bounded variation, then it is possible to write g ( x ) = g 1 ( x ) − − g 2 ( x ) {\displaystyle g(x)=g_{1}(x)-g_{2}(x)} where g 1 ( x ) = V x a g is the total variation of g in the interval [ a , x ] , and g 2 ( x ) = g 1 ( x ) − g ( x ) . Both g 1 and g 2 are monotone non-decreasing.

Now, if f is bounded, the Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral of f with respect to g is defined by ∫ ∫ a b f ( x ) d g ( x ) = ∫ ∫ a b f ( x ) d g 1 ( x ) − − ∫ ∫ a b f ( x ) d g 2 ( x ) , {\displaystyle \int _{a}^{b}f(x)\,dg(x)=\int _{a}^{b}f(x)\,dg_{1}(x)-\int _{a}^{b}f(x)\,dg_{2}(x),} where the latter two integrals are well-defined by the preceding construction.

Daniell integral [ edit ] An alternative approach ( Hewitt & Stromberg 1965 ) is to define the Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral as the Daniell integral that extends the usual Riemann–Stieltjes integral.  Let g be a non-decreasing right-continuous function on [ a , b ] , and define I ( f ) to be the Riemann–Stieltjes integral I ( f ) = ∫ ∫ a b f ( x ) d g ( x ) {\displaystyle I(f)=\int _{a}^{b}f(x)\,dg(x)} for all continuous functions f . The functional I defines a Radon measure on [ a , b ] .  This functional can then be extended to the class of all non-negative functions by setting I ¯ ¯ ( h ) = sup { I ( f ) : f ∈ ∈ C [ a , b ] , 0 ≤ ≤ f ≤ ≤ h } I ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ( h ) = inf { I ( f ) : f ∈ ∈ C [ a , b ] , h ≤ ≤ f } .

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\overline {I}}(h)&=\sup \left\{I(f)\ :\ f\in C[a,b],0\leq f\leq h\right\}\\{\overline {\overline {I}}}(h)&=\inf \left\{I(f)\ :\ f\in C[a,b],h\leq f\right\}.\end{aligned}}} For Borel measurable functions, one has I ¯ ¯ ( h ) = I ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ( h ) , {\displaystyle {\overline {I}}(h)={\overline {\overline {I}}}(h),} and either side of the identity then defines the Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral of h .  The outer measure μ g is defined via μ μ g ( A ) := I ¯ ¯ ( χ χ A ) = I ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ( χ χ A ) {\displaystyle \mu _{g}(A):={\overline {I}}(\chi _{A})={\overline {\overline {I}}}(\chi _{A})} where χ A is the indicator function of A .

Integrators of bounded variation are handled as above by decomposing into positive and negative variations.

Example [ edit ] Suppose that γ : [ a , b ] → R 2 is a rectifiable curve in the plane and ρ : R 2 → [0, ∞) is Borel measurable. Then we may define the length of γ with respect to the Euclidean metric weighted by ρ to be ∫ ∫ a b ρ ρ ( γ γ ( t ) ) d ℓ ℓ ( t ) , {\displaystyle \int _{a}^{b}\rho (\gamma (t))\,d\ell (t),} where ℓ ℓ ( t ) {\displaystyle \ell (t)} is the length of the restriction of γ to [ a , t ] . This is sometimes called the ρ -length of γ . This notion is quite useful for various applications: for example, in muddy terrain the speed in which a person can move may depend on how deep the mud is. If ρ ( z ) denotes the inverse of the walking speed at or near z , then the ρ -length of γ is the time it would take to traverse γ . The concept of extremal length uses this notion of the ρ -length of curves and is useful in the study of conformal mappings .

Integration by parts [ edit ] A function f is said to be "regular" at a point a if the right and left hand limits f ( a +) and f ( a −) exist, and the function takes at a the average value f ( a ) = f ( a − − ) + f ( a + ) 2 .

{\displaystyle f(a)={\frac {f(a-)+f(a+)}{2}}.} Given two functions U and V of finite variation, if at each point either at least one of U or V is continuous or U and V are both regular, then an integration by parts formula for the Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral holds: [ 2 ] ∫ ∫ a b U d V + ∫ ∫ a b V d U = U ( b + ) V ( b + ) − − U ( a − − ) V ( a − − ) , − − ∞ ∞ < a < b < ∞ ∞ .

{\displaystyle \int _{a}^{b}U\,dV+\int _{a}^{b}V\,dU=U(b+)V(b+)-U(a-)V(a-),\qquad -\infty <a<b<\infty .} Here the relevant Lebesgue–Stieltjes measures are associated with the right-continuous versions of the functions U and V ; that is, to U ~ ~ ( x ) = lim t → → x + U ( t ) {\textstyle {\tilde {U}}(x)=\lim _{t\to x^{+}}U(t)} and similarly V ~ ~ ( x ) .

{\displaystyle {\tilde {V}}(x).} The bounded interval ( a , b ) may be replaced with an unbounded interval (-∞, b ) , ( a , ∞) or (-∞, ∞) provided that U and V are of finite variation on this unbounded interval. Complex-valued functions may be used as well.

An alternative result, of significant importance in the theory of stochastic calculus is the following. Given two functions U and V of finite variation, which are both right-continuous and have left-limits (they are càdlàg functions) then U ( t ) V ( t ) = U ( 0 ) V ( 0 ) + ∫ ∫ ( 0 , t ] U ( s − − ) d V ( s ) + ∫ ∫ ( 0 , t ] V ( s − − ) d U ( s ) + ∑ ∑ u ∈ ∈ ( 0 , t ] Δ Δ U u Δ Δ V u , {\displaystyle U(t)V(t)=U(0)V(0)+\int _{(0,t]}U(s-)\,dV(s)+\int _{(0,t]}V(s-)\,dU(s)+\sum _{u\in (0,t]}\Delta U_{u}\Delta V_{u},} where Δ U t = U ( t ) − U ( t −) . This result can be seen as a precursor to Itô's lemma , and is of use in the general theory of stochastic integration. The final term is Δ U ( t )Δ V ( t ) = d [ U , V ], which arises from the quadratic covariation of U and V . (The earlier result can then be seen as a result pertaining to the Stratonovich integral .) Related concepts [ edit ] Lebesgue integration [ edit ] When g ( x ) = x for all real x , then μ g is the Lebesgue measure , and the Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral of f with respect to g is equivalent to the Lebesgue integral of f .

Riemann–Stieltjes integration and probability theory [ edit ] Where f is a continuous real-valued function of a real variable and v is a non-decreasing real function, the Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral is equivalent to the Riemann–Stieltjes integral , in which case we often write ∫ ∫ a b f ( x ) d v ( x ) {\displaystyle \int _{a}^{b}f(x)\,dv(x)} for the Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral, letting the measure μ v remain implicit. This is particularly common in probability theory when v is the cumulative distribution function of a real-valued random variable X , in which case ∫ ∫ − − ∞ ∞ ∞ ∞ f ( x ) d v ( x ) = E [ f ( X ) ] .

{\displaystyle \int _{-\infty }^{\infty }f(x)\,dv(x)=\mathrm {E} [f(X)].} (See the article on Riemann–Stieltjes integration for more detail on dealing with such cases.) Notes [ edit ] ^ Halmos (1974), Sec. 15 ^ Hewitt, Edwin (May 1960). "Integration by Parts for Stieltjes Integrals".
