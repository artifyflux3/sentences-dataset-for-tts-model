The shekel and mina ("profane" or "sacred") were units of both weight and volume. A shekel or mina weight was equal to the weight of that volume of water. The talent was a measure of weight used for large amounts of coinage. Some related units were used in Persia in the 19th century, and are still used in contemporary Iran.

Ancient Persian units [ edit ] Length [ edit ] Persian unit Persian name Relation to previous unit Metric Value Imperial Value digit finger انگشت (angosht) [ 1 ] ≈ 20 mm [ citation needed ] ≈ 0.8 in hand dva 5 aiwas ≈ 100 mm [ citation needed ] ≈ 4 in foot trayas 3 dva ≈ 300 mm [ citation needed ] ≈ 1 foot four-hands remen 4 dva ≈ 400 mm [ citation needed ] ≈ 16 in cubit (five-hands) pank'a dva 5 dva ≈ 500 mm [ citation needed ] ≈ 20 in great cubit (six-hands) (k)swacsh dva 6 dva ≈ 600 mm [ citation needed ] ≈ 2 ft pace pank'a 5 trayas ≈ 1.5 m [ citation needed ] ≈ 5 ft [ citation needed ] ten-foot daca trayas 2 pank'a ≈ 3 m [ citation needed ] ≈ 10 ft hundred-foot chebel 8 daca trayas ≈ 24 m [ citation needed ] ≈ 80 ft league, the distance a horse could walk in one hour.

[ citation needed ] parasang 250 chebel ≈ 6 km [ citation needed ] ≈ 3.75 miles [ citation needed ] mansion, one day's march on the Royal Road .

( Greek stathmos ) 4 or 5 parasang ≈ 24–30 km ≈ 14–18 miles Asparsa Asparsa [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] ≈ 187–195 m and = 360 cubits Volume [ edit ] The shekel and mina ("profane" or "sacred") were units of both weight and volume. A shekel or mina weight was equal to the weight of that volume of water. Note that the values given for the mina do not match the definitions.

1 shekel = 8.3 ml (approximately 1 cubic aiwas ).

1 profane mina = 50 shekel = 500 ml (approximately 27 cubic aiwas ).

1 sacred mina = 60 shekel = 600 ml (approximately 1 cubic dva ).

1 talent (volume) = 60 profane mina = 25 liters (approximately 1  cubic trayas ).

Weight [ edit ] The talent was a measure of weight used for large amounts of coinage (bullion, bulk coin), rather than an individual coin. Seven Babylonian talents equalled ten Attic talents, according to a list of the revenues of Cyrus the Great (Cyrus II of Persia) recorded in Herodotus .

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] 𐎣𐎼𐏁 (karša) or 𐎣𐎼𐏁𐎹𐎠 (karšayā) is a unit of weight equal to 10 Babylonian shekels or 1 ⁄ 6 Babylonian mina weighing approximately 83 g (2.9 oz).

[ 7 ] Units used in modern Persia (Iran) [ edit ] Some related units were used in Persia in the 19th century, and are still used in contemporary Iran .

Length [ edit ] 1 arsani or ulna = 52-64 cm.

1 arish = 38.27 inches (97.21 cm) [ 8 ] 1 chebel = 40 arsani = 21-25 meters or 23-30 yards.

1 farsang (parasang) = 6.23 km in 19th century Persia.

1 farsang = 10 kilometers in modern Iran and Turkey .

Volume [ edit ] 1 chenica = 1.32 liters.
