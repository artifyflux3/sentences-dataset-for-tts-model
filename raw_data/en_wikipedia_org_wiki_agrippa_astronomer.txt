Agrippa ( Greek : Ἀγρίππας ; fl.

92 AD ) was a Greek astronomer .  The only thing that is known about him regards an astronomical observation that he made in 92 AD.

[ 1 ] Ptolemy writes that in the twelfth year of the reign of Domitian , on the seventh day of the Bithynian month Metrous , Agrippa observed the occultation of a part of the Pleiades by the southernmost part of the Moon .

[ 2 ] The purpose of Agrippa's observation was probably to check the precession of the equinoxes , which was discovered by Hipparchus .

[ 3 ] The lunar crater Agrippa is named after him.
