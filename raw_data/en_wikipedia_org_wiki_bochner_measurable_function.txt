The concept is named after Salomon Bochner .

Bochner-measurable functions are sometimes called strongly measurable , μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } -measurable or just measurable (or uniformly measurable in case that the Banach space is the space of continuous linear operators between Banach spaces).

Properties [ edit ] The relationship between measurability and weak measurability is given by the following result, known as Pettis ' theorem or Pettis measurability theorem .

Function f is almost surely separably valued (or essentially separably valued ) if there exists a subset N ⊆ X with μ ( N ) = 0 such that f ( X \ N ) ⊆ B is separable.

A function f  : X → B defined on a measure space ( X , Σ, μ ) and taking values in a Banach space B is (strongly) measurable (with respect to Σ and the Borel algebra on B ) if and only if it is both weakly measurable and almost surely separably valued.

In the case that B is separable, since any subset of a separable Banach space is itself separable, one can take N above to be empty, and it follows that the notions of weak and strong measurability agree when B is separable.
