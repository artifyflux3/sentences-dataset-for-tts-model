It has a tawny to creamy white or pale buff fur that is marked with evenly spaced, solid black spots. The head is small and rounded, with a short snout and black tear-like facial streaks. It reaches 67–94 cm (26–37 in) at the shoulder, and the head-and-body length is between 1.1 and 1.5 m (3 ft 7 in and 4 ft 11 in). Adults weigh between 21 and 65 kg (46 and 143 lb). The cheetah is capable of running at 93 to 104 km/h (58 to 65 mph); it has evolved specialized adaptations for speed, including a light build, long thin legs and a long tail.

The cheetah was first scientifically described in the late 18th century. Four subspecies are recognised today that are native to Africa and central Iran . An African subspecies was introduced to India in 2022. It is now distributed mainly in small, fragmented populations in northwestern, eastern and southern Africa and central Iran. It lives in a variety of habitats such as savannahs in the Serengeti , arid mountain ranges in the Sahara , and hilly desert terrain.

The cheetah lives in three main social groups : females and their cubs, male "coalitions", and solitary males. While females lead a nomadic life searching for prey in large home ranges , males are more sedentary and instead establish much smaller territories in areas with plentiful prey and access to females. The cheetah is active during the day, with peaks during dawn and dusk. It feeds on small- to medium-sized prey, mostly weighing under 40 kg (88 lb), and prefers medium-sized ungulates such as impala , springbok and Thomson's gazelles . The cheetah typically stalks its prey within 60–100 m (200–330 ft) before charging towards it, trips it during the chase and bites its throat to suffocate it to death. It breeds throughout the year. After a gestation of nearly three months, females give birth to a litter of three or four cubs. Cheetah cubs are highly vulnerable to predation by other large carnivores. They are weaned at around four months and are independent by around 20 months of age.

The cheetah is threatened by habitat loss , conflict with humans, poaching and high susceptibility to diseases. The global cheetah population was estimated at 6,517 individuals in 2021; it is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List . It has been widely depicted in art, literature, advertising, and animation. It was tamed in ancient Egypt and trained for hunting ungulates in the Arabian Peninsula and India. It has been kept in zoos since the early 19th century.

Etymology The vernacular name "cheetah" is derived from Hindustani Urdu : چیتا and Hindi : चीता ( ćītā ).

[ 3 ] This in turn comes from Sanskrit : चित्रय ( Chitra-ya ) meaning 'variegated', 'adorned' or 'painted'.

[ 4 ] In the past, the cheetah was often called "hunting leopard" because they could be tamed and used for coursing .

[ 5 ] The generic name Acinonyx probably derives from the combination of two Greek words: ἀκίνητος ( akī́nētos ) meaning 'unmoved' or 'motionless', and ὄνυξ ( ónyx ) meaning 'nail' or 'hoof'.

[ 6 ] A rough translation is "immobile nails", a reference to the cheetah's limited ability to retract its claws.

[ 7 ] A similar meaning can be obtained by the combination of the Greek prefix a– (implying a lack of) and κῑνέω ( kīnéō ) meaning 'to move' or 'to set in motion'.

[ 8 ] The specific name jubatus is Latin for 'crested, having a mane'.

[ 9 ] A few old generic names such as Cynailurus and Cynofelis allude to the similarities between the cheetah and canids .

[ 10 ] Taxonomy An illustration of the "woolly cheetah" (described as Felis lanea ) from the Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London (1877) In 1777, Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber described the cheetah based on a skin from the Cape of Good Hope and gave it the scientific name Felis jubatus .

[ 11 ] Joshua Brookes proposed the generic name Acinonyx in 1828.

[ 12 ] In 1917, Reginald Innes Pocock placed the cheetah in a subfamily of its own, Acinonychinae, [ 13 ] given its striking morphological resemblance to the greyhound and significant deviation from typical felid features; the cheetah was classified in Felinae in later taxonomic revisions.

[ 14 ] In the 19th and 20th centuries, several cheetah zoological specimens were described; some were proposed as subspecies .

[ 15 ] A South African specimen with notably dense fur was proposed as ( Felis lanea ) by Philip Sclater in 1877 and became known as the "woolly cheetah".

[ 16 ] Its classification as a species was mostly disputed.

[ 17 ] There has been considerable confusion in the nomenclature of the cheetah and leopard ( Panthera pardus ) as authors often confused the two; some considered "hunting leopards" an independent species, or equal to the leopard.

[ 18 ] [ 19 ] Subspecies In 1975, five cheetah subspecies were considered valid taxa : A. j. hecki , A. j. jubatus , A. j. raineyi , A. j. soemmeringii and A. j. venaticus .

[ 20 ] In 2011, a phylogeographic study found minimal genetic variation between A. j. jubatus and A. j. raineyi ; only four subspecies were identified.

[ 21 ] In 2017, the Cat Classification Task Force of the IUCN Cat Specialist Group revised felid taxonomy and recognised these four subspecies as valid. Their details are tabulated below: [ 20 ] Subspecies Details Image Range map Southeast African cheetah ( A. j. jubatus ) (Schreber, 1775) syn.

A. j. raineyi Heller , 1913 [ 22 ] The nominate subspecies; [ 15 ] it genetically diverged from the Asiatic cheetah 67,000–32,000 years ago.

[ 21 ] As of 2016, the largest population of nearly 4,000 individuals is sparsely distributed in Angola , Botswana , Mozambique , Namibia , South Africa and Zambia .

[ 23 ] Asiatic cheetah ( A. j. venaticus ) Griffith , 1821 [ 24 ] This subspecies is confined to central Iran, and is the only surviving cheetah population in Asia.

[ 25 ] As of 2022, only 12 individuals were estimated to survive in Iran, nine of which are males and three of which are females.

[ 26 ] Northeast African cheetah ( A. j. soemmeringii ) Fitzinger , 1855 [ 27 ] This subspecies occurs in the northern Central African Republic , Chad , Ethiopia and South Sudan in small and heavily fragmented populations; in 2016, the largest population of 238 individuals occurred in the northern CAR and southeastern Chad. It diverged genetically from the southeast African cheetah 72,000–16,000 years ago.

[ 21 ] Northwest African cheetah ( A. j. hecki ) Hilzheimer , 1913 [ 28 ] This subspecies occurs in Algeria , Benin , Burkina Faso , Mali and Niger .

[ 1 ] In 2016, the largest population of 191 individuals occurred in Adrar des Ifoghas , Ahaggar and Tassili n'Ajjer in south-central Algeria and northeastern Mali.

[ 25 ] It is listed as critically endangered on the IUCN Red List.

[ 29 ] Phylogeny and evolution Lynx lineage Lynx Puma lineage Acinonyx Cheetah Puma Cougar P. concolor Herpailurus Jaguarundi H. yagouaroundi Domestic cat lineage Felis Leopard cat lineage Otocolobus Prionailurus The Puma lineage of the family Felidae , depicted along with closely related genera [ 30 ] The cheetah's closest relatives are the cougar ( Puma concolor ) and the jaguarundi ( Herpailurus yagouaroundi ).

[ 20 ] Together, these three species form the Puma lineage, one of the eight lineages of the extant felids ; the Puma lineage genetically diverged from the rest 6.7 mya . The sister group of the Puma lineage is a clade of smaller Old World cats that includes the genera Felis , Otocolobus and Prionailurus .

[ 30 ] The oldest cheetah fossils , excavated in eastern and southern Africa, date to 3.5–3 mya; the earliest known specimen from South Africa is from the lowermost deposits of the Silberberg Grotto ( Sterkfontein ).

[ 2 ] [ 8 ] Though incomplete, these fossils indicate forms larger but less cursorial than the modern cheetah.

[ 31 ] The first occurrence of the modern species A. jubatus in Africa may come from Cooper's D, a site in South Africa dating back to 1.5 to 1.4 Ma, during the Calabrian stage .

[ 32 ] Fossil remains from Europe are limited to a few Middle Pleistocene specimens from Hundsheim (Austria) and Mosbach Sands (Germany).

[ 33 ] Cheetah-like cats are known from as late as 10,000 years ago from the Old World. The giant cheetah ( A. pardinensis ), significantly larger and slower compared to the modern cheetah, occurred in Eurasia and eastern and southern Africa in the Villafranchian period roughly 3.8–1.9 mya.

[ 14 ] [ 34 ] In the Middle Pleistocene a smaller cheetah, A. intermedius , ranged from Europe to China.

[ 2 ] The modern cheetah appeared in Africa around 1.9 mya; its fossil record is restricted to Africa.

[ 31 ] Extinct North American cheetah-like cats had historically been classified in Felis , Puma or Acinonyx ; two such species, F. studeri and F. trumani , were considered to be closer to the puma than the cheetah, despite their close similarities to the latter. Noting this, palaeontologist Daniel Adams proposed Miracinonyx , a new subgenus under Acinonyx , in 1979 for the North American cheetah-like cats; [ 35 ] this was later elevated to genus rank.

[ 36 ] Adams pointed out that North American and Old World cheetah-like cats may have had a common ancestor, and Acinonyx might have originated in North America instead of Eurasia.

[ 35 ] However, subsequent research has shown that Miracinonyx is phylogenetically closer to the cougar than the cheetah; [ 37 ] the similarities to cheetahs have been attributed to parallel evolution .

[ 30 ] The three species of the Puma lineage may have had a common ancestor during the Miocene (roughly 8.25 mya).

[ 35 ] [ 38 ] Some suggest that North American cheetahs possibly migrated to Asia via the Bering Strait , then dispersed southward to Africa through Eurasia at least 100,000 years ago; [ 39 ] [ 40 ] [ 41 ] some authors have expressed doubt over the occurrence of cheetah-like cats in North America, and instead suppose the modern cheetah to have evolved from Asian populations that eventually spread to Africa.

[ 37 ] [ 42 ] The cheetah is thought to have experienced two population bottlenecks that greatly decreased the genetic variability in populations; one occurred about 100,000 years ago that has been correlated to migration from North America to Asia, and the second 10,000–12,000 years ago in Africa, possibly as part of the Late Pleistocene extinction event .

[ 40 ] [ 43 ] [ 44 ] Genetics King cheetah The diploid number of chromosomes in the cheetah is 38, the same as in most other felids.

[ 45 ] The cheetah was the first felid observed to have unusually low genetic variability among individuals, [ 46 ] which has led to poor breeding in captivity, increased spermatozoal defects, high juvenile mortality and increased susceptibility to diseases and infections.

[ 47 ] [ 48 ] A prominent instance was the deadly feline coronavirus outbreak in the cheetah breeding facility at Wildlife Safari in Winston, Oregon in 1983 which had a mortality rate of 60%, higher than that recorded for previous epizootics of feline infectious peritonitis in any felid.

[ 49 ] The remarkable homogeneity in cheetah genes has been demonstrated by experiments involving the major histocompatibility complex (MHC); unless the MHC genes are highly homogeneous in a population, skin grafts exchanged between a pair of unrelated individuals would be rejected. Skin grafts exchanged between unrelated cheetahs are accepted well and heal, as if their genetic makeup were the same.

[ 50 ] [ 51 ] The low genetic diversity is thought to have been created by two population bottlenecks from about 100,000 years and about 12,000 years ago, respectively.

[ 40 ] The resultant level of genetic variation is around 0.1–4% of average living species, lower than that of Tasmanian devils , Virunga gorillas , Amur tigers , and even highly inbred domestic cats and dogs.

[ 48 ] Selective retention of gene duplication has been found in 10 gene candidates to explain energetics and anabolism related to muscle specialization in cheetahs: Regulation of muscle contraction (Five genes: ADORA1 , ADRA1B , CACNA1C , RGS2 , SCN5A ).

Physiological stress response (Two genes: ADORA1 , TAOK2 ).

Negative regulation of catabolic process (Four genes: APOC3 , SUFU , DDIT4 , PPARA ).

[ 40 ] [ 48 ] This gene duplication may have allowed new functions to arise for the aforementioned genes; this selective pressure may also have contributed to the low genetic diversity in this species.

[ 52 ] Potentially harmful mutations has been found in a gene related to spermatogenesis ( AKAP4 ). This could explain the high proportion of abnormal sperma in male cheetahs and poor reproductive success in the species.

[ 40 ] [ 48 ] King cheetah The king cheetah is a variety of cheetah with a rare mutation for cream-coloured fur marked with large, blotchy spots and three dark, wide stripes extending from the neck to the tail.

[ 53 ] In Manicaland , Zimbabwe, it was known as nsuifisi and thought to be a cross between a leopard and a hyena .

[ 54 ] In 1926, Major A. Cooper wrote about a cheetah-like animal he had shot near modern-day Harare , with fur as thick as that of a snow leopard and spots that merged to form stripes. He suggested it could be a cross between a leopard and a cheetah. As more such individuals were observed it was seen that they had non-retractable claws like the cheetah.

[ 55 ] [ 56 ] In 1927, Pocock described these individuals as a new species by the name of Acinonyx rex ("king cheetah").

[ 55 ] However, in the absence of proof to support his claim, he withdrew his proposal in 1939.

Abel Chapman considered it a colour morph of the normally spotted cheetah.

[ 57 ] Since 1927, the king cheetah has been reported five more times in the wild in Zimbabwe, Botswana and northern Transvaal ; one was photographed in 1975.

[ 54 ] In 1981, two female cheetahs that had mated with a wild male from Transvaal at the De Wildt Cheetah and Wildlife Centre (South Africa) gave birth to one king cheetah each; subsequently, more king cheetahs were born at the centre.

[ 57 ] In 2012, the cause of this coat pattern was found to be a mutation in the gene for transmembrane aminopeptidase (Taqpep), the same gene responsible for the striped "mackerel" versus blotchy "classic" pattern seen in tabby cats .

[ 58 ] The appearance is caused by reinforcement of a recessive allele ; hence if two mating cheetahs are heterozygous carriers of the mutated allele, a quarter of their offspring can be expected to be king cheetahs.

[ 59 ] Characteristics Cheetah portrait showing black "tear marks" running from the corners of the eyes down the side of the nose The cheetah is a lightly built, spotted cat characterised by a small rounded head, a short snout , black tear-like facial streaks, a deep chest, long thin legs and a long tail. Its slender, canine-like form is highly adapted for speed, and contrasts sharply with the robust build of the genus Panthera .

[ 10 ] [ 60 ] Cheetahs typically reach 67–94 cm (26–37 in) at the shoulder and the head-and-body length is between 1.1 and 1.5 m (3 ft 7 in and 4 ft 11 in).

[ 8 ] [ 61 ] [ 62 ] The weight can vary with age, health, location, sex and subspecies; adults typically range between 21 and 65 kg (46 and 143 lb).

[ 63 ] [ 64 ] Cubs born in the wild weigh 150–300 g (5.3–10.6 oz) at birth, while those born in captivity tend to be larger and weigh around 500 g (18 oz).

[ 10 ] [ 61 ] The cheetah is sexually dimorphic , with males larger and heavier than females, but not to the extent seen in other large cats; females have a much lower body mass index than males.

[ 63 ] Studies differ significantly on morphological variations among the subspecies.

[ 63 ] The coat is typically tawny to creamy white or pale buff (darker in the mid-back portion).

[ 8 ] [ 61 ] The chin, throat and underparts of the legs and the belly are white and devoid of markings. The rest of the body is covered with around 2,000 evenly spaced, oval or round solid black spots, each measuring roughly 3–5 cm (1.2–2.0 in).

[ 59 ] [ 65 ] Each cheetah has a distinct pattern of spots which can be used to identify unique individuals.

[ 62 ] Besides the clearly visible spots, there are other faint, irregular black marks on the coat.

[ 65 ] Newly born cubs are covered in fur with an unclear pattern of spots that gives them a dark appearance—pale white above and nearly black on the underside.

[ 10 ] The hair is mostly short and often coarse, but the chest and the belly are covered in soft fur; the fur of king cheetahs has been reported to be silky.

[ 8 ] [ 66 ] There is a short, rough mane, covering at least 8 cm (3.1 in) along the neck and the shoulders; this feature is more prominent in males. The mane starts out as a cape of long, loose blue to grey hair in juveniles.

[ 59 ] [ 66 ] Melanistic cheetahs are rare and have been seen in Zambia and Zimbabwe.

[ 65 ] In 1877–1878, Sclater described two partially albino specimens from South Africa.

[ 59 ] The head is small and more rounded compared to other big cats .

[ 67 ] Saharan cheetahs have canine-like slim faces.

[ 65 ] The ears are small, short and rounded; they are tawny at the base and on the edges and marked with black patches on the back. The eyes are set high and have round pupils .

[ 62 ] The whiskers, shorter and fewer than those of other felids, are fine and inconspicuous.

[ 68 ] The pronounced tear streaks (or malar stripes), unique to the cheetah, originate from the corners of the eyes and run down the nose to the mouth. The role of these streaks is not well understood—they may protect the eyes from the sun's glare (a helpful feature as the cheetah hunts mainly during the day), or they could be used to define facial expressions.

[ 65 ] The exceptionally long and muscular tail, with a bushy white tuft at the end, measures 60–80 cm (24–31 in).

[ 69 ] While the first two-thirds of the tail are covered in spots, the final third is marked with four to six dark rings or stripes.

[ 59 ] [ 70 ] The cheetah is superficially similar to the leopard, which has a larger head, fully retractable claws, rosettes instead of spots, lacks tear streaks and is more muscular.

[ 71 ] [ 72 ] Moreover, the cheetah is taller than the leopard. The serval also resembles the cheetah in physical build, but is significantly smaller, has a shorter tail and its spots fuse to form stripes on the back.

[ 73 ] The cheetah appears to have evolved convergently with canids in morphology and behaviour; it has canine-like features such as a relatively long snout, long legs, a deep chest, tough paw pads and blunt, semi-retractable claws.

[ 74 ] [ 75 ] The cheetah has often been likened to the greyhound, as both have similar morphology and the ability to reach tremendous speeds in a shorter time than other mammals, [ 66 ] [ 69 ] but the cheetah can attain much higher maximum speeds.

[ 76 ] Internal anatomy Close view of a cheetah. Note the lightly built, slender body, spotted coat and long tail The blunt claws and the sharp, curved dewclaw Sharply contrasting with the other big cats in its morphology, the cheetah shows several specialized adaptations for prolonged chases to catch prey at some of the fastest speeds reached by land animals.

[ 77 ] Its light, streamlined body makes it well-suited to short, explosive bursts of speed, rapid acceleration, and an ability to execute extreme changes in direction while moving at high speed.

[ 78 ] [ 79 ] [ 80 ] The large nasal passages , accommodated well due to the smaller size of the canine teeth, ensure fast flow of sufficient air, and the enlarged heart and lungs allow the enrichment of blood with oxygen in a short time. This allows cheetahs to rapidly regain their stamina after a chase.

[ 2 ] During a typical chase, their respiratory rate increases from 60 to 150 breaths per minute.

[ 81 ] The cheetah has a fast heart rate, averaging 126–173 beats per minute at resting without arrhythmia.

[ 82 ] [ 83 ] Moreover, the reduced viscosity of the blood at higher temperatures (common in frequently moving muscles) could ease blood flow and increase oxygen transport .

[ 84 ] While running, in addition to having good traction due to their semi-retractable claws, cheetahs use their tail as a rudder-like means of steering that enables them to make sharp turns, necessary to outflank antelopes which often change direction to escape during a chase.

[ 59 ] [ 67 ] The protracted claws increase grip over the ground, while rough paw pads make the sprint more convenient over tough ground. The limbs of the cheetah are longer than what is typical for other cats its size; the thigh muscles are large, and the tibia and fibula are held close together making the lower legs less likely to rotate. This reduces the risk of losing balance during runs, but compromises the cat's ability to climb trees. The highly reduced clavicle is connected through ligaments to the scapula , whose pendulum-like motion increases the stride length and assists in shock absorption. The extension of the vertebral column can add as much as 76 cm (30 in) to the stride length.

[ 85 ] [ 86 ] Muscle tissue has been analyzed in the cheetah and it has been found that there are little differences in type IIx muscle fiber concentration, anaerobic lactate dehydrogenase enzyme activity, and glycogen concentration between sexes.

[ 87 ] Cheetah skull.

Cheetah skeleton. Note the deep chest and long limbs.

The cheetah resembles the smaller cats in cranial features, and in having a long and flexible spine, as opposed to the stiff and short one in other large felids.

[ 2 ] The roughly triangular skull has light, narrow bones and the sagittal crest is poorly developed, possibly to reduce weight and enhance speed. The mouth can not be opened as widely as in other cats given the shorter length of muscles between the jaw and the skull.

[ 59 ] [ 71 ] A study suggested that the limited retraction of the cheetah's claws may result from the earlier truncation of the development of the middle phalanx bone in cheetahs.

[ 77 ] The cheetah has a total of 30 teeth; the dental formula is 3.1.3.1 3.1.2.1 . The small, flat canines are used to bite the throat and suffocate the prey. A study gave the bite force quotient (BFQ) of the cheetah as 119, close to that for the lion (112), suggesting that adaptations for a lighter skull may not have reduced the power of the cheetah's bite.

[ 2 ] [ 10 ] Unlike other cats, the cheetah's canines have no gap or diastema behind them when the jaws close, as the top and bottom cheek teeth show extensive overlap.

[ 60 ] Cheetahs have relatively elongated, blade-like shape carnassial teeth, with reduced lingual cusps; this may have been an adaptation to consume quickly the flesh of a prey before more heavy-built predators from other species arrive to take it from them.

[ 88 ] [ 89 ] The slightly curved claws, shorter and straighter than those of other cats, lack a protective sheath and are partly retractable.

[ 59 ] [ 62 ] The claws are blunt due to lack of protection, [ 65 ] but the large and strongly curved dewclaw is remarkably sharp.

[ 90 ] Cheetahs have a high concentration of nerve cells arranged in a band in the centre of the eyes, a visual streak, the most efficient among felids. This significantly sharpens the vision and enables the cheetah to swiftly locate prey against the horizon.

[ 60 ] [ 91 ] The cheetah is unable to roar due to the presence of a sharp-edged vocal fold within the larynx .

[ 2 ] [ 92 ] In stressful situations, the cheetah has a lower cortisol level than the leopard, indicating better stress response; it also has lower immunoglobulin G and Serum amyloid A levels but a higher lysozyme level and a higher bacterial killing capacity than the leopard, indicating a poorer adaptive and induced innate immune systems but a better constitutive innate immune system; its constitutive innate immune system compensates for its low variation of major histocompatibility complex and poorer immune adaptability.

[ 93 ] Speed and acceleration Documentary video filmed at 1200 frames per second showing the movement of Sarah , the fastest recorded cheetah, over a set run The cheetah is the world's fastest land animal.

[ 94 ] [ 95 ] Estimates of the maximum speed attained range from 80 to 128 km/h (50 to 80 mph).

[ 59 ] [ 62 ] A commonly quoted value is 112 km/h (70 mph), recorded in 1957, but this measurement is disputed.

[ 96 ] In 2012, an 11-year-old cheetah from the Cincinnati Zoo set a world record by running 100 m (330 ft) in 5.95 seconds over a set run, recording a maximum speed of 98 km/h (61 mph).

[ 97 ] Cheetahs equipped with GPS collars hunted at speeds during most of the chase much lower than the highest recorded speed; their run was interspersed with a few short bursts of a few seconds when they attained peak speeds. The average speed recorded during the high speed phase was 53.64 km/h (33.3 mph), or within the range 41.4–65.88 km/h (25.7–40.9 mph) including error. The highest recorded value was 93.24 km/h (57.9 mph). A hunt consists of two phases, an initial fast acceleration phase when the cheetah tries to catch up with the prey, followed by slowing down as it closes in on it, the deceleration varying by the prey in question. The initial linear acceleration observed was 13 m/s² , more than twice than 6 m/s² of horses and greater than 10 m/s² of greyhounds.

[ 98 ] [ 99 ] Cheetahs can increase up 3 m/s (10.8 km/h) and decrease up 4 m/s (14.4 km/h) in a single stride.

[ 100 ] Speed and acceleration values for a hunting cheetah may be different from those for a non-hunter because while engaged in the chase, the cheetah is more likely to be twisting and turning and may be running through vegetation.

[ 100 ] [ 80 ] The speeds of more than 100 km/h attained by the cheetah may be only slightly greater than those achieved by the pronghorn at 88.5 km/h (55.0 mph) [ 101 ] and the springbok at 88 km/h (55 mph), [ 102 ] but the cheetah additionally has an exceptional acceleration, can go from 0–97 km/h (0–60 mph) in less than 3 seconds, "faster than a Ferrari".

[ 103 ] [ 104 ] For comparison, polo horses can go from 0 to 36 km/h in 3.6 seconds.

[ 105 ] One stride of a galloping cheetah measures 4 to 7 m (13 to 23 ft); the stride length and the number of jumps increases with speed.

[ 59 ] It has been estimated that a cheetah at full speed could take 4 strides per second.

[ 106 ] During more than half the duration of the sprint, the cheetah has all four limbs in the air, increasing the stride length.

[ 107 ] Running cheetahs can retain up to 90% of the heat generated during the chase. A 1973 study suggested the length of the sprint is limited by excessive build-up of body heat when the body temperature reaches 40–41 °C (104–106 °F). However, a 2013 study recorded the average temperature of cheetahs after hunts to be 38.6 °C (101.5 °F), suggesting high temperatures need not cause hunts to be abandoned.

[ 108 ] [ 109 ] The running speed of 71 mph (114 km/h) of the cheetah was obtained as an result of a single run of one individual by dividing the distance traveled for time spent. The run lasted 2.25 seconds and was supposed to have been 73 m (240 ft) long, but was later found to have been 59 m (194 ft) long. It was therefore discredited for a faulty method of measurement.

[ 110 ] Cheetahs have subsequently been measured at running at a speed of 104 km/h (65 mph) as the fastest speed from three runs including in opposite direction, for a single individual, over a marked 201 m (220 yd) course, even starting the run 18 m (59 ft) behind the start line, starting the run already running on the course. Again dividing the distance by time, but this time to determine the maximum sustained speed, completing the runs in a time of 7.0, 6.9 and 7.2 seconds. Being a more accurate method of measurement, this test was made in 1965 but published in 1997.

[ 111 ] In 2010, the running speed of 15 cheetahs was measured by means of high speed camera stationed on a tripod and placed at specific points on a track; the cheetahs were chasing a lure and there were several attempts per individual, and their length from the nose to base of the tail was used as a scale. The speed was estimated from the time the tip of the nose appeared until it was no longer visible on camera. The maximum speed recorded was 100.1 km/h for one individual.

[ 112 ] Subsequently, with GPS- IMU collars, in 2011 and 2012, running speed was measured for wild cheetahs during hunts with turns and manoeuvres, and the maximum speed recorded was 58 mph (93 km/h) sustained for 1–2 seconds. The speed was obtained by dividing the length by the time between footfalls of a stride.

[ 100 ] There are indirect ways to measure how fast a cheetah can run. One case is known of a cheetah that overtook a young male pronghorn . Cheetahs can overtake a running antelope with a 140 m (150 yd) head start. Both animals were clocked at 80 km/h (50 mph) by speedometer reading while running alongside a vehicle at full speed.

[ 110 ] Cheetahs can easily capture gazelles galloping at full speed (70–80 km/h (43–50 mph)).

[ 64 ] The physiological reasons for speed in cheetahs are: Small head and long lumbar region of the spine, 36.8% of the presacral vertebral column.

[ 31 ] [ 113 ] [ 36 ] A tibia and radius longer than the femur and humerus , with a femorotibial index of 101.9–105 and a humeroradial index of 100.1–103.3.

[ 31 ] [ 36 ] [ 113 ] Elongated and slender long bones of the limbs, especially femur, tibia, humerus, radius and pelvis , specially the ischium .

[ 10 ] [ 113 ] [ 95 ] Enlarged respiratory passages and frontal sinuses that allow to cool inhaled and exhaled air with each breath, which helps dissipate body heat.

[ 89 ] [ 114 ] A higher concentration of glycolytic fast twitch muscle fibers (Type IIx) than other cats and animals in general.

[ 103 ] [ 115 ] [ 116 ] A very high lactate dehydrogenase activity is indicative of this principally anaerobic muscle metabolism.

[ 103 ] Most of the locomotor muscle mass is concentrated proximally close to the body in shoulders, thighs and spine, and is reduced in shins and forearms. Long tendons finish off the distal locomotor muscles.

[ 10 ] [ 95 ] Muscular hindlimbs form 19.8% of the body mass, whereas the forelimbs form 15.1%.

[ 95 ] [ 117 ] The hamstrings , quadriceps , adductor muscles of the hip and psoas major muscles are especially large.

[ 118 ] Enlarged Betz cells in the motor cortex M1 and innervating muscle fibers, to fit its predominant type IIx fibers and powerful muscles.

[ 119 ] Distribution and habitat Cheetahs occur in various habitats, such as the grasslands of the Serengeti In eastern and southern Africa, the cheetah occurs mostly in savannas like the Kalahari and Serengeti. In central, northern and western Africa, it inhabits arid mountain ranges and valleys; in the harsh climate of the Sahara, it prefers high mountains, which receive more rainfall than the surrounding desert. The vegetation and water resources in these mountains support antelopes. In Iran, it occurs in hilly terrain of deserts at elevations up to 2,000–3,000 m (6,600–9,800 ft), where annual precipitation is generally below 100 mm (3.9 in); the primary vegetation in these areas is thinly distributed shrubs, less than 1 m (3 ft 3 in) tall.

[ 1 ] [ 65 ] [ 120 ] The cheetah inhabits a variety of ecosystems and appears to be less selective in habitat choice than other felids; it prefers areas with greater availability of prey, good visibility and minimal chances of encountering larger predators. It seldom occurs in tropical forests. It has been reported at the elevation of 4,000 m (13,000 ft). An open area with some cover, such as diffused bushes, is probably ideal for the cheetah because it needs to stalk and pursue its prey over a distance. This also minimises the risk of encountering larger carnivores. The cheetah tends to occur in low densities typically between 0.3 and 3.0 adults per 100 km 2 (39 sq mi); these values are 10–30% of those reported for leopards and lions.

[ 1 ] [ 120 ] Historical range Three of the last wild cheetahs in India were shot in 1947 by Maharaja Ramanuj Pratap Singh Deo of Surguja In prehistoric times, the cheetah was distributed throughout Africa, Asia and Europe.

[ 59 ] It gradually fell to extinction in Europe, possibly because of competition with the lion.

[ 14 ] Today the cheetah has been extirpated in most of its historical range; the numbers of the Asiatic cheetah had begun plummeting since the late 1800s, long before the other subspecies started their decline. As of 2017, cheetahs occur in just nine per cent of their erstwhile range in Africa, mostly in unprotected areas.

[ 25 ] In the past until the mid-20th century, the cheetah ranged across vast stretches in Asia, from the Arabian Peninsula in the west to the Indian subcontinent in the east, and as far north as the Aral and Caspian Seas.

[ 121 ] A few centuries ago the cheetah was abundant in India, and its range coincided with the distribution of major prey like the blackbuck.

[ 59 ] However, its numbers in India plummeted from the 19th century onward; Divyabhanusinh of the Bombay Natural History Society notes that the last three individuals in the wild were killed by Maharaja Ramanuj Pratap Singh of Surguja in 1947.

[ 122 ] [ 123 ] The last confirmed sighting in India was of a cheetah that drowned in a well near Hyderabad in 1957.

[ 124 ] Vladimir Geptner wrote that the cheetah's range in the Soviet Union encompassed the "desert plains of Middle Asia and southern Kazakhstan and the eastern Trans-Caucasus ". During the Middle Ages , the cheetah ranged as far as western Georgia and probably survived in the Kura-Aras lowland and central Aras valley as recently as the eighteenth century, though it went extinct in the region following the decline of goitered gazelles and due to human persecution. By the mid-20th century, the cheetah was reportedly "still quite extensively if sparsely distributed throughout the region west of the Amu-Darya and Aral Sea , but has been vanishing very rapidly".

[ 45 ] In Iraq, cheetahs were reported from Basra in the 1920s. In Iran there were around 400 cheetahs before World War II , distributed across deserts and steppes to the east and the borderlands with Iraq to the west; the numbers were falling because of a decline in prey. Conservation efforts in the 1950s stabilised the population, but prey species declined again in the wake of the Iranian Revolution (1979) and the Iran–Iraq War (1980–1988), leading to a significant contraction of the cheetah's historical range in the region.

[ 25 ] [ 125 ] In 1975, the cheetah population was estimated at 15,000 individuals throughout Sub-Saharan Africa , following the first survey in this region by Norman Myers . The range covered most of eastern and southern Africa, except for the desert region on the western coast of modern-day Angola and Namibia.

[ 126 ] In the following years, cheetah populations across the region have become smaller and more fragmented as their natural habitat has been modified dramatically.

[ 127 ] Present distribution The cheetah occurs mostly in eastern and southern Africa; its presence in Asia is limited to the central deserts of Iran, though there have been unconfirmed reports of sightings in Afghanistan, Iraq and Pakistan in the last few decades.

[ 1 ] [ 25 ] The global population of cheetahs was estimated at nearly 7,100 mature individuals in 2016. The Iranian population appears to have decreased from 60–100 individuals in 2007 to 43 in 2016, distributed in three subpopulations over less than 150,000 km 2 (58,000 sq mi) in Iran's central plateau.

[ 23 ] [ 128 ] The largest population of nearly 4,000 individuals is sparsely distributed over Angola, Botswana, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa and Zambia. Another population in Kenya and Tanzania comprises about 1,000 individuals. All other cheetahs occur in small, fragmented groups of less than 100 individuals each. Populations are thought to be declining.

[ 23 ] Ecology and behaviour Cheetahs are active mainly during the day, [ 66 ] whereas other carnivores such as leopards and lions are active mainly at night; [ 71 ] [ 129 ] These larger carnivores can kill cheetahs and steal their kills; [ 59 ] hence, the diurnal tendency of cheetahs helps them avoid larger predators in areas where they are sympatric , such as the Okavango Delta . In areas where the cheetah is the major predator (such as farmlands in Botswana and Namibia), activity tends to increase at night. This may also happen in highly arid regions such as the Sahara, where daytime temperatures can reach 43 °C (109 °F). The lunar cycle can also influence the cheetah's routine—activity might increase on moonlit nights as prey can be sighted easily, though this comes with the danger of encountering larger predators.

[ 59 ] [ 120 ] Hunting is the major activity throughout the day, with peaks during dawn and dusk.

[ 65 ] Groups rest in grassy clearings after dusk. Cheetahs often inspect their vicinity at observation points such as elevations to check for prey or larger carnivores; even while resting, they take turns at keeping a lookout.

[ 59 ] Social organisation Female with her cubs in Phinda Private Game Reserve A group of males in Maasai Mara Cheetahs have a flexible and complex social structure and tend to be more gregarious than several other cat species. Individuals typically avoid one another but are generally amicable; males may fight over territories or access to females in oestrus , and on rare occasions such fights can result in severe injury and death. Females are not social and have minimal interaction with other individuals, barring the interaction with males when they enter their territories or during the mating season. Some females, generally mother and offspring or siblings, may rest beside one another during the day. Females tend to lead a solitary life or live with offspring in undefended home ranges ; young females often stay close to their mothers for life but young males leave their mother's range to live elsewhere.

[ 59 ] [ 62 ] [ 65 ] Some males are territorial, and group together for life, forming coalitions that collectively defend a territory which ensures maximum access to females—this is unlike the behaviour of the male lion who mates with a particular group (pride) of females. In most cases, a coalition will consist of brothers born in the same litter who stayed together after weaning, but biologically unrelated males are often allowed into the group; in the Serengeti, 30% of members in coalitions are unrelated males.

[ 65 ] If a cub is the only male in a litter, he will typically join an existing group, or form a small group of solitary males with two or three other lone males who may or may not be territorial. In the Kalahari Desert around 40% of the males live in solitude.

[ 62 ] [ 65 ] Males in a coalition are affectionate toward each other, grooming mutually and calling out if any member is lost; unrelated males may face some aversion in their initial days in the group. All males in the coalition typically have equal access to kills when the group hunts together, and possibly also to females who may enter their territory.

[ 130 ] A coalition generally has a greater chance of encountering and acquiring females for mating; however, its large membership demands greater resources than do solitary males.

[ 62 ] [ 65 ] A 1987 study showed that solitary and grouped males have a nearly equal chance of coming across females, but the males in coalitions are notably healthier and have better chances of survival than their solitary counterparts.

[ 131 ] Male cheetahs seem to be more tolerant to cubs that are not their offspring than other felids, and supposed evidence of infanticide is considered circumstantial.

[ 132 ] [ 133 ] Home ranges and territories Unlike many other felids, among cheetahs, females tend to occupy larger areas compared to males.

[ 62 ] Females typically disperse over large areas in pursuit of prey, but they are less nomadic and roam in a smaller area if prey availability in the area is high. As such, the size of their home range depends on the distribution of prey in a region. In central Namibia, where most prey species are sparsely distributed, home ranges average 554–7,063 km 2 (214–2,727 sq mi), whereas in the woodlands of the Phinda Game Reserve (South Africa), which have plentiful prey, home ranges are 34–157 km 2 (13–61 sq mi) in size.

[ 65 ] Cheetahs can travel long stretches overland in search of food; a study in the Kalahari Desert recorded an average displacement of nearly 11 km (6.8 mi) every day and walking speeds ranged between 2.5 and 3.8 km/h (1.6 and 2.4 mph).

[ 120 ] Males are generally less nomadic than females; often males in coalitions (and sometimes solitary males staying far from coalitions) establish territories.

[ 59 ] [ 62 ] Whether males settle in territories or disperse over large areas forming home ranges depends primarily on the movements of females. Territoriality is preferred only if females tend to be more sedentary, which is more feasible in areas with plenty of prey. Some males, called floaters, switch between territoriality and nomadism depending on the availability of females.

[ 65 ] A 1987 study showed territoriality depended on the size and age of males and the membership of the coalition.

[ 131 ] The ranges of floaters averaged 777 km 2 (300 sq mi) in the Serengeti to 1,464 km 2 (565 sq mi) in central Namibia. In the Kruger National Park (South Africa) territories were much smaller. A coalition of three males occupied a territory measuring 126 km 2 (49 sq mi), and the territory of a solitary male measured 195 km 2 (75 sq mi).

[ 65 ] When a female enters a territory, the males will surround her; if she tries to escape, the males will bite or snap at her. Generally, the female can not escape on her own; the males themselves leave after they lose interest in her. They may smell the spot she was sitting or lying on to determine if she was in oestrus.

[ 130 ] Communication Male marking his territory Calls of cheetahs: purr, hiss, growl, churr, meow, chirp, howl The cheetah is a vocal felid with a broad repertoire of calls and sounds; the acoustic features and the use of many of these have been studied in detail.

[ 134 ] The vocal characteristics, such as the way they are produced, are often different from those of other cats.

[ 135 ] For instance, a study showed that exhalation is louder than inhalation in cheetahs, while no such distinction was observed in the domestic cat .

[ 136 ] [ 137 ] Listed below are some commonly recorded vocalisations observed in cheetahs: Chirping: A chirp (or a "stutter-bark") is an intense bird-like call and lasts less than a second. Cheetahs chirp when they are excited, for instance, when gathered around a kill. Other uses include summoning concealed or lost cubs by the mother, or as a greeting or courtship between adults.

[ 135 ] The cheetah's chirp is similar to the soft roar of the lion, and its churr as the latter's loud roar.

[ 134 ] A similar but louder call ('yelp') can be heard from up to 2 km (1.2 mi) away; this call is typically used by mothers to locate lost cubs, or by cubs to find their mothers and siblings.

[ 59 ] [ 61 ] Churring (or churtling): A churr is a shrill, staccato call that can last up to two seconds. Churring and chirping have been noted for their similarity to the soft and loud roars of the lion. It is produced in similar context as chirping, but a study of feeding cheetahs found chirping to be much more common.

[ 66 ] [ 135 ] Purring: Similar to purring in domestic cats but much louder, it is produced when the cheetah is content, and as a form of greeting or when licking one another.

[ 59 ] [ 135 ] It involves continuous sound production alternating between egressive and ingressive airstreams.

[ 138 ] Agonistic sounds: These include bleating, coughing, growling, hissing, meowing and moaning (or yowling). A bleat indicates distress, for instance when a cheetah confronts a predator that has stolen its kill. Growls, hisses and moans are accompanied by multiple, strong hits on the ground with the front paw, during which the cheetah may retreat by a few metres.

[ 134 ] [ 135 ] [ 139 ] A meow, though a versatile call, is typically associated with discomfort or irritation.

[ 134 ] [ 140 ] Other vocalisations: Individuals can make a gurgling noise as part of a close, amicable interaction.

[ 59 ] A "nyam nyam" sound may be produced while eating. Apart from chirping, mothers can use a repeated "ihn ihn" is to gather cubs, and a "prr prr" is to guide them on a journey. A low-pitched alarm call is used to warn the cubs to stand still. Bickering cubs can let out a "whirr"—the pitch rises with the intensity of the quarrel and ends on a harsh note.

[ 66 ] [ 135 ] Another major means of communication is by scent —the male will often raise his tail and spray urine on elevated landmarks such as a tree trunks, stumps or rocks; other cheetahs will sniff these landmarks and repeat the ritual. Females may also show marking behaviour but less prominently than males do. Females in oestrus will show maximum urine-marking, and their excrement can attract males from far off. In Botswana, cheetahs are frequently captured by ranchers to protect livestock by setting up traps in traditional marking spots; the calls of the trapped cheetah can attract more cheetahs to the place.

[ 66 ] [ 62 ] Touch and visual cues are other ways of signalling in cheetahs. Social meetings involve mutual sniffing of the mouth, anus and genitals. Individuals will groom one another, lick each other's faces and rub cheeks. However, they seldom lean on or rub their flanks against each other. The tear streaks on the face can sharply define expressions at close range. Mothers probably use the alternate light and dark rings on the tail to signal their cubs to follow them.

[ 66 ] Diet and hunting A cheetah in pursuit of a Thomson's gazelle A cheetah strangling an impala by a throat bite A group of cheetahs feeding on a kill The cheetah is a carnivore that hunts small to medium-sized prey weighing 20 to 60 kg (44 to 132 lb), but mostly less than 40 kg (88 lb). Its primary prey are medium-sized ungulates. They are the major component of the diet in certain areas, such as Dama and Dorcas gazelles in the Sahara, impala in the eastern and southern African woodlands, springbok in the arid savannas to the south and Thomson's gazelle in the Serengeti. Smaller antelopes like the common duiker are frequent prey in the southern Kalahari. Larger ungulates are typically avoided, though nyala , whose males weigh around 120 kg (260 lb), were found to be the major prey in a study in the Phinda Game Reserve. In Namibia cheetahs are the major predators of livestock.

[ 8 ] [ 59 ] [ 141 ] The diet of the Asiatic cheetah consists of chinkara , desert hare , goitered gazelle , urial , wild goats , and livestock; in India cheetahs used to prey mostly on blackbuck .

[ 65 ] [ 142 ] Prey preferences and hunting success vary with the age, sex and number of cheetahs involved in the hunt and on the vigilance of the prey. Generally, only groups of cheetahs (coalitions or mother and cubs) will try to kill larger prey; mothers with cubs especially look out for larger prey and tend to be more successful than females without cubs. Individuals on the periphery of the prey herd are common targets; vigilant prey which would react quickly on seeing the cheetah are not preferred.

[ 45 ] [ 59 ] [ 143 ] Cheetahs are one of the most iconic pursuit predators , hunting primarily throughout the day, sometimes with peaks at dawn and dusk ; they tend to avoid larger predators like the primarily nocturnal lion.

[ 65 ] Cheetahs in the Sahara and Maasai Mara in Kenya hunt after sunset to escape the high temperatures of the day.

[ 144 ] Cheetahs use their vision to hunt instead of their sense of smell; they keep a lookout for prey from resting sites or low branches. The cheetah will stalk its prey, trying to conceal itself in cover, and approach as close as possible, often within 60 to 70 m (200 to 230 ft) of the prey (or even closer for less alert prey). Alternatively the cheetah can lie hidden in cover and wait for the prey to come nearer. A stalking cheetah assumes a partially crouched posture, with the head lower than the shoulders; it will move slowly and be still at times. In areas of minimal cover, the cheetah will approach within 200 m (660 ft) of the prey and start the chase. The chase typically lasts a minute; in a 2013 study, the length of chases averaged 173 m (568 ft), and the longest run measured 559 m (1,834 ft).

[ 100 ] The cheetah can give up the chase if it is detected by the prey early or if it cannot make a kill quickly. Being lightly built, cheetahs lack the raw strength to tackle down the prey, and instead catch the prey by performing a kind of foot sweep by hitting the prey's leg or rump with the forepaw or using the strong dewclaw to knock the prey off its balance. Such a fall during a high-speed chase may cause the prey to collapse hard enough to break some of its limbs, [ 59 ] [ 66 ] and allow the cheetah to then pounce on the fallen and vulnerable prey.

Cheetahs can decelerate dramatically towards the end of the hunt, slowing down from 58 km/h (36 mph) to 14 km/h (9 mph) in just three strides, and can easily follow any twists and turns the prey makes as it tries to flee.

[ 65 ] To kill medium- to large-sized prey, the cheetah bites the prey's throat to strangle it, maintaining the bite for around five minutes, within which the prey succumbs to asphyxiation and stops struggling. A bite on the nape of the neck or the snout (and sometimes on the skull) suffices to kill smaller prey.

[ 59 ] [ 66 ] Cheetahs have an average hunting success rate of 25–40%, higher for smaller and more vulnerable prey.

[ 65 ] [ 81 ] Once the hunt is over, the prey is taken near a bush or under a tree; the cheetah, highly exhausted after the chase, rests beside the kill and pants heavily for five to 55 minutes. Meanwhile, cheetahs nearby, who did not take part in the hunt, might feed on the kill immediately. Groups of cheetah consume the kill peacefully, though minor noises and snapping may be observed.

[ 59 ] Cheetahs can consume large quantities of food; a cheetah at the Etosha National Park (Namibia) was found to consume as much as 10 kg (22 lb) within two hours.

[ 145 ] However, on a daily basis, a cheetah feeds on around 4 kg (8.8 lb) of meat.

[ 66 ] Cheetahs, especially mothers with cubs, remain cautious even as they eat, pausing to look around for vultures and predators who may steal the kill.

[ 146 ] Cheetahs move their heads from side to side so the blade-like shape carnassial teeth tear the flesh, which can then be swallowed without chewing. They typically begin with the hindquarters where the tissue is the softest, and then progress toward the abdomen and the spine. Ribs are chewed on at the ends, and the limbs are not generally torn apart while eating. Unless the prey is very small, the skeleton is left almost intact after feeding on the meat. Cheetahs might lose up 13–14 % of their kills to larger and stronger carnivores.

[ 64 ] To defend itself or its prey, a cheetah will hold its body low to the ground and snarl with its mouth wide open, the eyes staring threateningly ahead and the ears folded backward. This may be accompanied by moans, hisses and growls, and hitting the ground with the forepaws.

[ 66 ] Although uncommon, cases of wild cheetahs scavenging carcasses that not hunt themselves have been observed; even one case of a cheetah mother and her three 15 month old cubs stealing to a spotted hyena their kill (a topi ) is known. Causes of this scavenging behavior are unclear.

[ 147 ] [ 148 ] Cheetahs appear to have a comparatively higher hunting success rate than other predators.

[ 59 ] Their success rate for hunting Thomson gazelles is 70%, whereas the success rate of African wild dogs is 57%, of spotted hyenas 33%, and of lions 26%.

[ 64 ] Their success rate for hunting impalas is 26%, but of African wild dogs only 15.5%.

[ 98 ] Reproduction and life cycle Cub with mother Two older cubs playing The cheetah breeds throughout the year; females are polyestrous and induced ovulators with an estrous cycle of 12 days on average that can vary from three days to a month. They have their first litter at two to three years of age and can conceive again after 17 to 20 months from giving birth, or even sooner if a whole litter is lost. Males can breed at less than two years of age in captivity, but this may be delayed in the wild until the male acquires a territory.

[ 130 ] A 2007 study showed that females who gave birth to more litters early in their life often died younger, indicating a trade-off between longevity and yearly reproductive success.

[ 149 ] Urine-marking in males can become more pronounced when a female in their vicinity comes into estrus. Males, sometimes even those in coalitions, fight among one another to secure access to the female.

[ 150 ] Often one male will eventually win dominance over the others and mate with the female, though a female can mate with different males.

[ 151 ] Mating begins with the male approaching the female, who lies down on the ground; individuals often chirp, purr or yelp at this time. No courtship behaviour is observed; the male immediately secures hold of the female's nape, and copulation takes place. The pair then ignore each other, but meet and copulate a few more times three to five times a day for the next two to three days before finally parting ways.

[ 2 ] [ 66 ] [ 152 ] After a gestation of nearly three months, a litter of one to eight cubs is born (though those of three to four cubs are more common). Births take place at 20–25 minute intervals in a sheltered place such as thick vegetation. The eyes are shut at birth, and open in four to 11 days. Newborn cubs might spit a lot and make soft churring noises; they start walking by two weeks. Their nape, shoulders and back are thickly covered with long bluish-grey hair, called a mantle, which gives them a mohawk-type appearance; this fur is shed as the cheetah grows older.

[ 66 ] [ 14 ] A study suggested that this mane gives a cheetah cub the appearance of a honey badger , and could act as camouflage from attacks by these badgers or predators that tend to avoid them.

[ 153 ] Compared to other felids, cheetah cubs are highly vulnerable to several predators during the first few weeks of their life.

[ 154 ] [ 155 ] Mothers keep their cubs hidden in dense vegetation for the first two months and nurse in the early morning. The mother is extremely vigilant at this stage; she stays within 1 km (0.62 mi) of the lair, frequently visits her cubs, moves them every five to six days, and remains with them after dark. Despite trying to make minimal noise, she cannot generally defend her litter from predators. Predation is the leading cause of mortality in cheetah cubs; a study showed that in areas with a low density of predators (such as Namibian farmlands) around 70% of the cubs make it beyond the age of 14 months, whereas in areas like the Serengeti National Park, where several large carnivores exist, the survival rate was just 17%. Deaths also occur from starvation if their mothers abandon them, fires, or pneumonia because of exposure to bad weather.

[ 66 ] [ 130 ] Generation length of the cheetah is six years.

[ 156 ] Cubs start coming out of the lair at two months of age, trailing after their mother wherever she goes. At this point the mother nurses less and brings solid food to the cubs; they retreat away from the carcass in fear initially, but gradually start eating it. The cubs might purr as the mother licks them clean after the meal. Weaning occurs at four to six months. To train her cubs in hunting, the mother will catch and let go of live prey in front of her cubs.

[ 130 ] Cubs' play behaviour includes chasing, crouching, pouncing and wrestling; there is plenty of agility, and attacks are seldom lethal.

[ 66 ] [ 130 ] Playing can improve catching skills in cubs, though the ability to crouch and hide may not develop remarkably.

[ 157 ] Cubs as young as six months try to capture small prey like hares and young gazelles. However, they may have to wait until as long as 15 months of age to make a successful kill on their own. At around 20 months, offspring become independent; mothers might have conceived again by then. Siblings may remain together for a few more months before parting ways. While females stay close to their mothers, males move farther off.

[ 66 ] [ 130 ] [ 158 ] The lifespan of wild cheetahs is 14 to 15 years for females, and their reproductive cycle typically ends by 12 years of age; males generally live as long as ten years.

[ 1 ] Competition This section needs expansion . You can help by making an edit request adding to it .

( August 2025 ) Cheetahs losing their kill to a brown hyena Although cheetahs and spotted hyenas favor different prey, the latter will nevertheless steal cheetah kills with no difficulty, with George Schaller observing that cheetahs in the Serengeti lost 4% of their kills to them.

[ 159 ] Cheetahs, particularly females with cubs, may attempt to protect their kills from hyenas by making threatening vocalizations and lunges, but will retreat if the larger carnivores persist.

[ 66 ] However, the opposite situation can occur; a mother cheetah with three 15 month old cubs can chase away a lone spotted hyena from their kill.

[ 148 ] In Iran, cheetahs compete with leopards for chinkara , bezoar ibex and urial . One study undertaken in the Bafq Protected Area found that cheetahs avoided leopards by occupying lower elevations, though one cheetah was nevertheless killed by a leopard during the study.

[ 160 ] Cheetah mothers have however been observed to drive off leopards threatening their cubs.

[ 66 ] In north-central Namibia , a camera trap study between 2005–2014 found that a high proportion, 34 % of the scent marking sites, were visited by both cheetahs and leopards, compared to the number of sites visited exclusively by cheetahs at 6 %, sites visited exclusively by leopards at 16 %, and sites not visited at 44 %. Shared sites were visited by both predators at different times; cheetahs visited them at night while leopards visited them at early morning. Both predators urinated as the primary method of scent marking, but the second most frequent activity at the sites was defecation by cheetahs and tree scratching by leopards. Cheetahs marked the sites and defecated on them more frequently, perhaps because their urine is odourless, lacking the 3-mercapto-3-methylbutanol that gives other felid urines their characteristic odour, which causes their scent mark to disappear more quickly.

[ 161 ] [ 162 ] Threats The cheetah is threatened by several factors, like habitat loss and fragmentation of populations. Habitat loss is caused mainly by the introduction of commercial land use, such as agriculture and industry.

[ 1 ] It is further aggravated by ecological degradation, like woody plant encroachment , which is common in southern Africa.

[ 163 ] [ 164 ] [ 165 ] Moreover, the species apparently requires a sizeable area to live in as indicated by its low population densities. Shortage of prey and conflict with other species such as humans and large carnivores are other major threats.

[ 1 ] [ 166 ] The cheetah appears to be less capable of coexisting with humans than the leopard.

[ 167 ] With 76% of its range consisting of unprotected land, the cheetah is often targeted by farmers and pastoralists who attempt to protect their livestock, especially in Namibia.

[ 168 ] Illegal wildlife trade and trafficking is another problem in some places (like Ethiopia). Some tribes, like the Maasai people in Tanzania, have been reported to use cheetah skins in ceremonies.

[ 5 ] [ 31 ] Roadkill is another threat, especially in areas where roads have been constructed near natural habitat or protected areas. Cases of roadkill involving cheetahs have been reported from Kalmand, Touran National Park , and Bafq in Iran.

[ 1 ] The reduced genetic variability makes cheetahs more vulnerable to diseases; [ 48 ] however, the threat posed by infectious diseases may be minor, given the low population densities and hence a reduced chance of infection.

[ 1 ] Conservation The cheetah has been classified as Vulnerable on the IUCNRed List; it is listed under Appendix I of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals and Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species .

[ 1 ] The Endangered Species Act enlists the cheetah as Endangered.

[ 169 ] In Africa The Cheetah Conservation Fund 's Field and Research Centre in Otjiwarongo (Namibia) Until the 1970s, cheetahs and other carnivores were frequently killed to protect livestock in Africa. Gradually the understanding of cheetah ecology increased and their falling numbers became a matter of concern. The De Wildt Cheetah and Wildlife Centre was set up in 1971 in South Africa to provide care for wild cheetahs regularly trapped or injured by Namibian farmers.

[ 5 ] By 1987, the first major research project to outline cheetah conservation strategies was underway.

[ 170 ] The Cheetah Conservation Fund , founded in 1990 in Namibia, put efforts into field research and education about cheetahs on the global platform.

[ 5 ] The CCF runs a cheetah genetics laboratory, the only one of its kind, in Otjiwarongo (Namibia); [ 171 ] "Bushblok" is an initiative to restore habitat systematically through targeted bush thinning and biomass utilisation.

[ 164 ] [ 172 ] Several more cheetah-specific conservation programmes have since been established, like Cheetah Outreach in South Africa.

[ 5 ] The Global Cheetah Action Plan Workshop in 2002 laid emphasis on the need for a range-wide survey of wild cheetahs to demarcate areas for conservation efforts and on creating awareness through training programs.

[ 173 ] The Range Wide Conservation Program for Cheetah and African Wild Dogs began in 2007 as a joint initiative of the IUCN Cat and Canid Specialist Groups, the Wildlife Conservation Society and the Zoological Society of London . National conservation plans have been developed for several African countries.

[ 174 ] [ 175 ] In 2014, the CITES Standing Committee recognised the cheetah as a "species of priority" in their strategies in northeastern Africa to counter wildlife trafficking.

[ 176 ] In December 2016, the results of an extensive survey detailing the distribution and demography of cheetahs throughout the range were published; the researchers recommended listing the cheetah as Endangered on the IUCN Red List.

[ 23 ] The cheetah was reintroduced in Malawi in 2017.

[ 177 ] In Asia See also: Cheetah reintroduction in India Jairam Ramesh at the Cheetah Outreach Centre near Cape Town in 2010, during his visit to discuss cheetah translocation from South Africa to India In 2001, the Iranian government collaborated with the CCF, the IUCN, Panthera Corporation , United Nations Development Programme and the Wildlife Conservation Society on the Conservation of Asiatic Cheetah Project (CACP) to protect the natural habitat of the Asiatic cheetah and its prey.

[ 178 ] [ 179 ] In 2004, the Iranian Centre for Sustainable Development (CENESTA) conducted an international workshop to discuss conservation plans with local stakeholders.

[ 5 ] Iran declared 31 August as National Cheetah Day in 2006.

[ 180 ] The Iranian Cheetah Strategic Planning meet in 2010 formulated a five-year conservation plan for Asiatic cheetahs.

[ 5 ] The CACP Phase II was implemented in 2009, and the third phase was drafted in 2018.

[ 181 ] During the early 2000s scientists from the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology ( Hyderabad ) proposed a plan to clone Asiatic cheetahs from Iran for reintroduction in India, but Iran denied the proposal.

[ 182 ] In September 2009, the Minister of Environment and Forests assigned the Wildlife Trust of India and the Wildlife Institute of India with examining the potential of importing African cheetahs to India.

[ 183 ] Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary and Nauradehi Wildlife Sanctuary were suggested as reintroduction sites for the cheetah because of the high prey density.

[ 184 ] However, plans for reintroduction were stalled in May 2012 by the Supreme Court of India because of a political dispute and concerns over introducing a non-native species to the country. Opponents stated the plan was "not a case of intentional movement of an organism into a part of its native range".

[ 185 ] [ 186 ] On 28 January 2020, the Supreme Court allowed the central government to introduce cheetahs to a suitable habitat in India on an experimental basis to see if they can adapt to it.

[ 187 ] [ 188 ] In 2020, India signed a memorandum of understanding with Namibia as part of Project Cheetah.

[ 189 ] In July 2022, it was announced that eight cheetahs would be transferred from Namibia to India in August.

[ 190 ] The eight cheetahs were released into Kuno National Park on 17 September 2022.

[ 191 ] Since their introduction, they gave birth to 17 cubs. However, by September 2024, eight adult cheetahs and four cubs already died.

[ 192 ] Interaction with humans Taming A hieroglyph from Deir el-Bahari depicting leashed cheetahs ("panthers") Sketch of cheetahs belonging to the Nawab of Oudh with attendants (1844) The cheetah shows little aggression toward humans, and can be tamed easily, as it has been since antiquity.

[ 14 ] The earliest known depictions of the cheetah are from the Chauvet Cave in France, dating back to 32,000–26,000 BC.

[ 193 ] According to historians such as Heinz Friederichs and Burchard Brentjes , the cheetah was first tamed in Sumer and this gradually spread out to central and northern Africa, from where it reached India. The evidence for this is mainly pictorial; for instance, a Sumerian seal dating back to c.

3000 BC , featuring a long-legged leashed animal has fueled speculation that the cheetah was first tamed in Sumer. However, Thomas Allsen argues that the depicted animal might be a large dog.

[ 194 ] Other historians, such as Frederick Zeuner , have opined that ancient Egyptians were the first to tame the cheetah, from where it gradually spread into central Asia, Iran and India.

[ 195 ] In comparison, theories of the cheetah's taming in Egypt are stronger and include timelines proposed on this basis.

[ 195 ] Mafdet , one of the ancient Egyptian deities worshiped during the First Dynasty (3100–2900 BC), was sometimes depicted as a cheetah. Ancient Egyptians believed the spirits of deceased pharaohs were taken away by cheetahs.

[ 193 ] Reliefs in the Deir el-Bahari temple complex tell of an expedition by Egyptians to the Land of Punt during the reign of Hatshepsut (1507–1458 BC) that fetched, among other things, animals called "panthers". During the New Kingdom (16th to 11th centuries BC), cheetahs were common pets for royalty, who adorned them with ornate collars and leashes.

[ 195 ] Rock carvings depicting cheetahs dating back to 2000–6000 years ago have been found in Twyfelfontein ; little else has been discovered in connection to the taming of cheetahs (or other cats) in southern Africa.

[ 193 ] Hunting cheetahs are known in pre-Islamic Arabic art from Yemen.

[ 196 ] Hunting with cheetahs became more prevalent toward the seventh century AD. In the Middle East, the cheetah would accompany the nobility to hunts in a special seat on the back of the saddle. Taming was an elaborate process and could take a year to complete.

[ 193 ] The Romans may have referred to the cheetah as the leopardos ( λεοπάρδος ) or leontopardos ( λεοντόπαρδος ), believing it to be a hybrid between a leopard and a lion because of the mantle seen in cheetah cubs and the difficulty of breeding them in captivity.

[ 197 ] A Roman hunting cheetah is depicted in a 4th-century mosaic from Lod, Israel.

[ 198 ] Cheetahs continued to be used into the Byzantine period of the Roman Empire , with "hunting leopards" being mentioned in the Cynegetica (283/284 AD).

[ 197 ] [ 199 ] [ 200 ] In eastern Asia, records are confusing as regional names for the leopard and the cheetah may be used interchangeably. The earliest depiction of cheetahs from eastern Asia dates back to the Tang dynasty (7th to 10th centuries AD); paintings depict tethered cheetahs and cheetahs mounted on horses. Chinese emperors would use cheetahs and caracals as gifts. In the 13th and 14th centuries, the Yuan rulers bought numerous cheetahs from the western parts of the empire and from Muslim merchants. According to the Ming Shilu , the subsequent Ming dynasty (14th to 17th centuries) continued this practice.

[ 195 ] Tomb figurines from the Mongol empire, dating back to the reign of Kublai Khan (1260–1294 AD), represent cheetahs on horseback.

[ 193 ] The Mughal ruler Akbar the Great (1556–1605 AD) is said to have kept as many as 1000 khasa (imperial) cheetahs.

[ 81 ] [ 193 ] His son Jahangir wrote in his memoirs, Tuzk-e-Jahangiri , that only one of them gave birth.

[ 195 ] Mughal rulers trained cheetahs and caracals in a similar way as the western Asians, and used them to hunt game, especially blackbuck. The rampant hunting severely affected the populations of wild animals in India; by 1927, cheetahs had to be imported from Africa.

[ 193 ] In captivity The first cheetah to be brought into captivity in a zoo was at the Zoological Society of London in 1829. Early captive cheetahs showed a high mortality rate, with an average lifespan of 3–4 years. After trade of wild cheetahs was delimited by the enforcement of CITES in 1975, more efforts were put into breeding in captivity; in 2014 the number of captive cheetahs worldwide was estimated at 1730 individuals, with 87% born in captivity.

[ 5 ] [ 201 ] Mortality under captivity is generally high; in 2014, 23% of the captive cheetahs worldwide died under one year of age, mostly within a month of birth.

[ 201 ] Deaths result from several reasons—stillbirths, birth defects, cannibalism , hypothermia , maternal neglect, and infectious diseases.

[ 202 ] Compared to other felids, cheetahs need specialised care because of their higher vulnerability to stress-induced diseases; this has been attributed to their low genetic variability and factors of captive life.

[ 203 ] Common diseases of cheetahs include feline herpesvirus , feline infectious peritonitis, gastroenteritis , glomerulosclerosis , leukoencephalopathy , myelopathy , nephrosclerosis and veno-occlusive disease .

[ 203 ] [ 204 ] High density of cheetahs in a place, closeness to other large carnivores in enclosures, improper handling, exposure to public and frequent movement between zoos can be sources of stress for cheetahs. Recommended management practices for cheetahs include spacious and ample access to outdoors, stress minimisation by exercise and limited handling, and following proper hand-rearing protocols (especially for pregnant females).

[ 205 ] Wild cheetahs are far more successful breeders than captive cheetahs; [ 206 ] this has also been linked to increased stress levels in captive individuals.

[ 203 ] In a study in the Serengeti, females were found to have a 95% success rate in breeding, compared to 20% recorded for North American captive cheetahs in another study.

[ 207 ] [ 208 ] On 26 November 2017, a female cheetah gave birth to eight cubs at the Saint Louis Zoo , setting a record for the most births recorded by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums .

[ 209 ] Chances of successful mating in captive males can be improved by replicating social groups such as coalitions observed in the wild.

[ 210 ] Attacks on humans There are no documented records of lethal attacks on humans by wild cheetahs.

[ 211 ] However, there have been instances of people being fatally mauled by captive cheetahs. In 2007, a 37-year-old woman from Antwerp was killed by a cheetah in a Belgian zoo after sneaking into its cage outside of visiting hours.

[ 212 ] In 2017, a three-year-old child was attacked by a captive cheetah on a farm in Philippolis , South Africa. Despite being airlifted to a hospital in Bloemfontein , the boy died from his injuries.

[ 213 ] In culture Cheetahs as depicted on Bacchus and Ariadne by Titian , 1523 The cheetah has been widely portrayed in a variety of artistic works. In Bacchus and Ariadne , an oil painting by the 16th-century Italian painter Titian , the chariot of the Greek god Dionysus (Bacchus) is depicted as being drawn by two cheetahs. The cheetahs in the painting were previously considered to be leopards.

[ 214 ] In 1764, English painter George Stubbs commemorated the gifting of a cheetah to George III by the English Governor of Madras , Sir George Pigot in his painting Cheetah with Two Indian Attendants and a Stag . The painting depicts a cheetah, hooded and collared by two Indian servants, along with a stag it was supposed to prey upon.

[ 215 ] The 1896 painting The Caress by the 19th-century Belgian symbolist painter Fernand Khnopff is a representation of the myth of Oedipus and the Sphinx and portrays a creature with a woman's head and a cheetah's body.

[ 216 ] Two cheetahs are depicted standing upright and supporting a crown in the coat of arms of the Free State (South Africa).

[ 217 ] In 1969, Joy Adamson , of Born Free fame, wrote The Spotted Sphinx , a biography of her pet cheetah Pippa.

[ 218 ] Hussein, An Entertainment , a novel by Patrick O'Brian set in the British Raj period in India, illustrates the practice of royalty keeping and training cheetahs to hunt antelopes.

[ 219 ] The book How It Was with Dooms tells the true story of a family raising an orphaned cheetah cub named Dooms in Kenya. The 2005 film Duma was based loosely on this book.

[ 220 ] The animated series ThunderCats had a character named "Cheetara", an anthropomorphic cheetah, voiced by Lynne Lipton .

[ 221 ] Comic book heroine Wonder Woman 's chief adversary is Barbara Ann Minerva alias The Cheetah .

[ 222 ] The Bill Thomas Cheetah American racing car, a Chevrolet -based coupe first designed and driven in 1963, was never homologated for competition beyond prototype status; its production ended in 1966.

[ 223 ] In 1986, Frito-Lay introduced Chester Cheetah , an anthropomorphic cheetah, as the mascot for their snack food Cheetos .

[ 224 ] The Mac OS X 10.0 was code-named "Cheetah".
