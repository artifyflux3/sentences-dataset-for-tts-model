' Journal of the Learned ' ), established by Denis de Sallo , is the earliest academic journal published in Europe. It is thought to be the earliest published scientific journal. It currently focuses on European history and premodern literature.

History [ edit ] The first issue appeared as a twelve-page quarto pamphlet [ 1 ] on Monday, 5 January 1665.

[ 2 ] This was shortly before the first appearance of the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society , on 6 March 1665.

[ 3 ] The 18th-century French physician and encyclopédiste Louis-Anne La Virotte (1725–1759) was introduced to the journal through the protection of chancellor Henri François d'Aguesseau . Its content originally included obituaries of famous men, church history, scientific findings, and legal reports.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] Natural philosophy was part of its original scope. It is thought to be the first published scientific journal.

[ 6 ] The journal ceased publication in 1792, during the French Revolution , and, although it very briefly reappeared in 1797 under the updated title Journal des savants , it did not re-commence regular publication until 1816. From then on, the Journal des savants was published by the National Imprimery under the patronage of the Institut de France . From 1908 to 2020, it was published under the patronage of the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres . In 2021, the Belgian company Peeters took over publication. It continues to be a leading academic journal in French humanities scholarship.

Landmark articles [ edit ] Ole Rømer 's determination of the speed of light was published in the journal in 1676, which established that light did not propagate instantly. It came to about 26% slower than the actual value.

[ 7 ] In 1684 the journal published François Bernier 's racial theories.

[ 8 ] In 1692, Leibniz published his first explication of Monadology in the journal.

[ 9 ] In 1762 it carried Abraham Hyacinthe Anquetil-Duperron 's landmark study of Zoroastrianism .

[ citation needed ] A self-assured misreading of Japanese sources in an 1817 article by Jean-Pierre Abel-Rémusat [ 10 ] led to the name of the Bonin Islands to the south of Japan.
