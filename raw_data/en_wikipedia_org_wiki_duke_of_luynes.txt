[ 1 ] Luynes is, today, a commune of the Indre-et-Loire département in France .

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] The family of Albert, which sprang from Thomas Alberti (died 1455), seigneur de Boussargues , bailli of Viviers and Valence , and viguier of Bagnols [ 4 ] and Pont-Saint-Esprit in Languedoc , acquired the estate of Luynes in the 16th century.

From the marriage he received a dowry of 10,000 livres and the fief of Luynes in today's département Bouches-du-Rhône in Provence . His son Honoré was born five years later. Léon d'Albert died in the Italian Wars .

He had recently purchased the Comté de Maillé on the Loire , about 10 miles west of Tours , and the king erected Maillé into the Duchy of Luynes, which included about 50 parishes and extended to the western wall of Tours and around it on three sides.
