It is named after mathematicians Leonhard Euler and Francesco Giacomo Tricomi .

u x x + x u y y = 0.

{\displaystyle u_{xx}+xu_{yy}=0.\,} It is elliptic in the half plane x > 0, parabolic at x = 0 and hyperbolic in the half plane x < 0.
Its characteristics are x d x 2 + d y 2 = 0 , {\displaystyle x\,dx^{2}+dy^{2}=0,\,} which have the integral y ± ± 2 3 x 3 / 2 = C , {\displaystyle y\pm {\frac {2}{3}}x^{3/2}=C,} where C is a constant of integration .  The characteristics thus comprise two families of semicubical parabolas , with cusps on the line x = 0, the curves lying on the right hand side of the y -axis.

Particular solutions [ edit ] A general expression for particular solutions to the Euler–Tricomi equations is: u k , p , q = ∑ ∑ i = 0 k ( − − 1 ) i x m i y n i c i {\displaystyle u_{k,p,q}=\sum _{i=0}^{k}(-1)^{i}{\frac {x^{m_{i}}y^{n_{i}}}{c_{i}}}\,} where k ∈ ∈ N {\displaystyle k\in \mathbb {N} } p , q ∈ ∈ { 0 , 1 } {\displaystyle p,q\in \{0,1\}} m i = 3 i + p {\displaystyle m_{i}=3i+p} n i = 2 ( k − − i ) + q {\displaystyle n_{i}=2(k-i)+q} c i = m i !

{\displaystyle c_{i}=m_{i}!!!\cdot (m_{i}-1)!!!\cdot n_{i}!!\cdot (n_{i}-1)!!} These can be linearly combined to form further solutions such as: for k = 0 : u = A + B x + C y + D x y {\displaystyle u=A+Bx+Cy+Dxy\,} for k = 1 : u = A ( 1 2 y 2 − − 1 6 x 3 ) + B ( 1 2 x y 2 − − 1 12 x 4 ) + C ( 1 6 y 3 − − 1 6 x 3 y ) + D ( 1 6 x y 3 − − 1 12 x 4 y ) {\displaystyle u=A({\tfrac {1}{2}}y^{2}-{\tfrac {1}{6}}x^{3})+B({\tfrac {1}{2}}xy^{2}-{\tfrac {1}{12}}x^{4})+C({\tfrac {1}{6}}y^{3}-{\tfrac {1}{6}}x^{3}y)+D({\tfrac {1}{6}}xy^{3}-{\tfrac {1}{12}}x^{4}y)\,} etc.
