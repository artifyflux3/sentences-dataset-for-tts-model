The American Barbizon School was a group of painters and style partly influenced by the French Barbizon school , who were noted for their simple, pastoral scenes painted directly from nature.

[ 1 ] American Barbizon artists concentrated on painting rural landscapes which often included peasants or farm animals .

William Morris Hunt was the first American to work in the Barbizon style as he directly trained with Jean-François Millet in 1851–1853. When he left France, Hunt established a studio in Boston and worked in the Barbizon manner, bringing the style to the United States of America.

[ 2 ] The Barbizon approach was generally not accepted until the 1880s and reached its pinnacle of popularity in the 1890s.
