It is administered by the Australian Antarctic Division , an agency of the federal Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water . The territory's history dates to a claim on Enderby Land made by the United Kingdom in 1841, which was subsequently expanded and eventually transferred to Australia in 1933. It is the largest sector of Antarctica by area claimed by any country. Australia is an original signatory to the Antarctic Treaty of 1959. Under Article IV, all territorial claims are held in abeyance . Only four other countries accept Australia's claim to sovereignty, being New Zealand, the United Kingdom, France, and Norway, all of which have territorial claims in Antarctica and mutually accept each other’s claims.

[ 1 ] Area [ edit ] The AAT consists of all the islands and territory south of 60°S and between 44°38′E and 160°E , except for Adélie Land ( 136°E to 142°E ), which divides the territory into Western AAT (the larger portion) and Eastern AAT.

[ 2 ] It is bounded by Queen Maud Land in the West and by the Ross Dependency in the East. The Australian Antarctic Territory is the largest of any claims to the continent, and covers nearly 5.9 million square kilometres.

[ 3 ] This makes up about 42% of Antarctica , and would cover about 80% of Mainland Australia .

[ 4 ] It also corresponds to roughly twice the size of Queen Maud Land, India , Argentina or Kazakhstan .

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] The territory is mostly inhabited by the staff of research stations. The Australian Antarctic Division administers the area primarily by maintaining three year-round stations— Mawson , Davis , and Casey —which support various research projects.

[ 8 ] Subdivisions [ edit ] Map of districts of Australian Antarctic Territory Enderby Land Kemp Land Mac. Robertson Land Princess Elizabeth Land Kaiser Wilhelm II Land Queen Mary Land Wilkes Land (showing further subdivisions into 5 parts) George V Land Oates Land The territory is divided into nine districts, which are from west to east: [ 9 ] # District Area (km 2 ) Western border Eastern border Width 1 Enderby Land 449,900 044°38′ E 056°25′ E 011°47′ 2 Kemp Land ...

Exclusive economic zone [ edit ] Australia claims an exclusive economic zone (EEZ) from the Australian Antarctic Territory. However, the Australian proclamation of an Antarctic EEZ is contested.  The effect of Article IV of the 1959 Antarctic Treaty (which prohibits new territorial claims or the extension of existing claims in the Antarctic) would seem to be that an EEZ cannot be claimed in relation to territory to which that Treaty applies (south of 60° South).

[ citation needed ] The provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) define the exclusive economic zone of a coastal state as up to 200 nautical miles (370 km) from the baseline from which the territorial sea is measured.

[ 10 ] Whaling [ edit ] Whaling in Australian Antarctic territorial waters is controversial and has received international attention.

[ 11 ] Anti-whaling protest groups, in particular Sea Shepherd Conservation Society , have been active within the Australian Antarctic territorial waters. Sea Shepherd small boat crews have had multiple encounters with Japanese ships that claim to be on research expeditions while opponents argue this is only a "cover" for banned commercial whaling .

[ 12 ] [ 13 ] The Australian Whale Sanctuary , in Australian Antarctic territory, is not recognised by the government of Japan.

[ 11 ] Anti-whaling legislation passed by the Australian Government applies to Australian territorial waters.  However, Australia's claims of sovereignty over the Australian Antarctic Territory—and thus sovereignty over Australian Antarctic territorial waters—are recognised by only the United Kingdom, New Zealand, France and Norway.

[ 15 ] In 1933, the Australian Antarctic Territory Acceptance Act 1933 stated: That part of the territory in the Antarctic seas which comprises all the islands and territories, other than Adelie Land, situated south of the 60th degree south latitude and lying between the 160th degree east longitude and the 45th degree east longitude, is hereby declared to be accepted by the Commonwealth as a Territory under the authority of the Commonwealth, by the name of the Australian Antarctic Territory.

C2004C00416 /  Australian Antarctic Territory Acceptance Act 1933 ( Cth ) The borders with Adélie Land were fixed definitively in 1938. In 1947, Britain transferred Heard Island and McDonald Islands to the territory. On 13 February 1954, [ 16 ] Mawson Station was established as the first Australian station on the continent proper.

Recognition and promotion of Australian sovereignty [ edit ] Australia's claim to sovereignty over the Australian Antarctic Territory is recognised by only the United Kingdom, New Zealand, France and Norway.

[ 17 ] Ships of Japan conduct whaling  in Australian Antarctic territorial waters.

[ 18 ] In 2016, the Australian Government formulated an Antarctic Strategy and 20 Year "Action Plan" to improve overland transport capabilities and aviation access to the continent. The plan incorporated a strategy to protect the Antarctic environment and maintain an indefinite ban on mining and oil drilling. The construction of a research and resupply icebreaker vessel was also planned.

[ 19 ] The 25,000-tonne RSV Nuyina was delivered in 2021 and was immediately employed in support of the Casey Station . It is envisaged that the ship will support scientific research over the next 30 years.

[ 20 ] Through "Operation Southern Discovery", elements of the Australian Defence Force also provide annual support for the Australian Antarctic Division and the Australian Antarctic Program (AAP) in regional scientific, environmental and economic activities.

[ 21 ] The Royal Australian Air Force provides air logistical support using C-17 transport aircraft supported by KC-30 tanker aircraft to supply Wilkins airfield in Antarctica.

[ 22 ] Mining in Antarctica [ edit ] During the early 1980s, there was a brief debate in Australia on whether or not to allow mining on the mineral-rich continent .

[ 23 ] Several mining proposals have been discussed and have all been rejected.

[ 24 ] On 9 August 2011, the influential Australian think-tank, the Lowy Institute , published a report warning Canberra against complacency when it comes to its claim.

[ 25 ] The global treaty banning resource exploitation becomes reviewable in 2041, [ 26 ] and some states may then decide to withdraw from it considering the continent's mineral deposits. These include coal seams, manganese, iron and uranium, while Antarctica's forecast oil reserves are estimated as among the largest in the world after Saudi Arabia and Venezuela . Lowy's national security fellow Ellie Fogarty said in the paper that Australia cannot adequately patrol its claim, lacking the kind of ski-planes it needs to reach some areas.

Postage stamps [ edit ] This 1959 cover commemorated the opening of the Wilkes post office.

Main article: Postage stamps and postal history of the Australian Antarctic Territory Australia issues postage stamps for the Australian Antarctic Territory. The first issues came in 1957, and sporadically thereafter, settling into a pattern of an annual issue by the 1990s. All have been Antarctic-themed, and all are valid for postage in Australia and its territories, including Antarctica.

Telephone connections [ edit ] Assigned the country calling code +672 [ 27 ] 1[0-4] XXXX, the four stations and the Aurora Australis operated by the Australian Antarctic Division can be reached by direct calling from anywhere in the world. The area codes are 10 for Davis, 11 for Mawson, 12 for Casey, 13 for Macquarie Island and 14 for Wilkins and the Aurora Australis, in each case followed by four additional digits.

People [ edit ] See also: Administrative heads of the Australian Antarctic Territory As of May 2018, the AAT was believed to have a population of around 80 people during winters and 200 during summers.

In the 1980s, the question of possible mineral exploitation (including the hydrocarbons oil and gas) was addressed by the nations of the Antarctic Treaty.
