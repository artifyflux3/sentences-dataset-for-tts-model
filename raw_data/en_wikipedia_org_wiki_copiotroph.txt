They are the opposite to oligotrophs , which survive in much lower carbon concentrations.

[ 1 ] Copiotrophic organisms tend to grow in high organic substrate conditions. For example, copiotrophic organisms grow in Sewage lagoons . They grow in organic substrate conditions up to 100x higher than oligotrophs. Due to this substrate concentration inclination, copiotrophs are often found in nutrient rich waters near coastlines or estuaries .

[ 2 ] Classification and Identification [ edit ] The bacterial phyla can be differentiated into copiotrophic or oligotrophic categories that correspond and structure the functions of soil bacterial communities.

Interaction with other organisms [ edit ] Copiotrophic relation between oligotrophic bacteria depends on the amount of concentration the soil has of C compounds. If the soil has large amounts of organic C, it would then favor the copiotrophic bacteria.

Ecology [ edit ] Copiotrophic bacteria are a key component in the soil C cycle. It is most important during the period of the year when vegetation is photosynthetically active and exudes large amounts of simple C compounds like sugar , amino acids , and organic acids . Copiotrophic bacteria are also found within marine life.

Lifestyle [ edit ] Copiotrophs have a higher Michaelis-Menten constant than oligotrophs .

[ 3 ] This constant is directly correlated to environmental substrate preference.

[ 3 ] In these high resource environments, copiotrophs exhibit a “feast-and-famine” lifestyle.

[ 4 ] They utilize the available nutrients in the environment rapidly resulting in nutrient depletion which forces them to starve.

[ 4 ] This is possible through increasing their growth rate with nutrient uptake.

[ 5 ] However, when nutrients in the environment get depleted, copiotrophs struggle to survive for long periods of time.

[ 6 ] Copiotrophs do not have the ability to respond to starvation.

[ 6 ] It is hypothesized that this may be a lost trait.

[ 6 ] Another possibility is that microbes never evolved to survive these extreme conditions.

[ 6 ] Oligotrophs can outcompete copiotrophs in low-nutrient environments.

[ 6 ] This causes low-nutrient conditions to continue for extended periods of time, making it difficult for copiotrophs to sustain life.

[ 6 ] Copiotrophs are larger than oligotrophs and need more energy, requiring larger concentrations of substrate for survival.

[ 6 ] Copiotrophs are motile.

[ 2 ] Copiotrophs can have external organelles such as flagella that extend out of a microbe’s cell to facilitate movement.

[ 5 ] Copiotrophs are also chemotactic , meaning they can detect nutrients in the environment.

[ 7 ] These help the microbes travel quickly to nearby food sources.

[ 7 ] Chemotaxis also enables the organism to travel away from a restricting compound.

[ 7 ] There are multiple methods for chemotaxis in these organisms.

[ 7 ] This includes the “run and tumble” strategy in which the organism randomly picks a direction to move in.

[ 7 ] However, if it senses that the concentration gradient is decreasing they stop and choose another random direction to travel in.

[ 7 ] Another strategy includes the “run and reverse” in which the organism runs towards a nutrient.

[ 7 ] If it notices the gradient decreasing, it moves back to where the gradient is larger and heads in another direction from this new position.

[ 7 ] Through their motility and chemotaxis, copiotrophic microbes respond quickly to nutrients in their environment.

[ 2 ] With the help of these mechanisms, copiotrophs can travel to and stay in nutrient dense areas long enough for transcriptional regulatory systems to increase gene expression.

[ 5 ] This in turn helps them increase metabolic processes in high nutrient areas allowing them to maximize their growth during these patches.

[ 5 ] Growth characteristics [ edit ] Copiotrophs are characterized by a high maximum growth rate.

[ 8 ] This high growth rate allows for copiotrophs to have a larger genome and cell size than their oligotrophic counterparts.

[ 2 ] The copiotrophic genome encompasses more ribosomal RNA operons than the oligotrophic genome.

[ 8 ] Ribosomal RNA operons are linearly related to growth rate.

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] The ribosomal RNA operons are responsible for expression of genes in clusters.

[ 9 ] The larger amount of ribosomal content allows for more rapid growth.

[ 8 ] Oligotrophs have one ribosomal RNA operon while copiotrophs can contain up to fifteen operons.

[ 9 ] Copiotrophs tend to have a lower carbon use efficiency than oligotrophs.

[ 10 ] This is the ratio of carbon used for production of biomass per total carbon consumed by the organism.

[ 10 ] Carbon use efficiency can be used to understand organisms lifestyles, whether they primarily create biomass or require carbon for maintenance energy.

[ 10 ] [ 11 ] Energy is necessary for the copiotrophic lifestyle which includes motility and chemotaxis.

[ 12 ] This energy could otherwise be used for biomass production.

[ 12 ] This results in a lower efficiency than the oligotrophic lifestyle which primarily uses energy for the creation of biomass.

[ 12 ] Copiotrophs have a lower protein yield than oligotrophs.

[ 8 ] Protein yield is the amount of protein synthesized per O 2 consumed.

[ 8 ] This is also associated with the higher ribosomal RNA operons.

[ 8 ] Overall, copiotrophs create more protein than their oligotrophic peers, however due to the copiotrophs' lower carbon use efficiency, less protein is produced per gram O 2 consumed by the organisms.
