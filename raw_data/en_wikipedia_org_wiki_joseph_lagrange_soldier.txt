In 1813 he moved to maréchal Marmont 's corps, fighting in the siege of Hoertel, the marshlands of Bobinsk, the Battle of Dresden and the Battle of Leipzig . He also distinguished himself in the French campaign of 1814, notably in the Battle of Lesmont on 2 February 1814 and the Battle of Champaubert on 10 February 1814, where he was severely wounded in the head.
