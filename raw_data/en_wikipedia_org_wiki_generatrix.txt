In geometry , a generatrix ( / dʒ ɛ n ə ˈ r eɪ t r ɪ k s / ) or describent is a point , curve or surface that, when moved along a given path, generates a new shape .

[ 1 ] The path directing the motion of the generatrix motion is called a directrix or dirigent .

[ 2 ] Examples [ edit ] A cone can be generated by moving a line (the generatrix) fixed at the future apex of the cone along a closed curve (the directrix); if that directrix is a circle perpendicular to the line connecting its center to the apex, the motion is rotation around a fixed axis and the resulting shape is a circular cone.

[ 3 ] The generatrix of a cylinder , a limiting case of a cone, is a line that is kept parallel to some axis.
