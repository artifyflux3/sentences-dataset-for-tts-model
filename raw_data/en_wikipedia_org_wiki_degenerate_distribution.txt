For instance, in the n -dimensional space ℝ n endowed with the Lebesgue measure , any distribution concentrated on a d -dimensional subspace with d < n is a degenerate distribution on ℝ n .

[ 1 ] This is essentially the same notion as a singular probability measure , but the term degenerate is typically used when the distribution arises as a limit of (non-degenerate) distributions.

When the support of a degenerate distribution consists of a single point a , this distribution is a Dirac measure in a : it is the distribution of a deterministic random variable equal to a with probability 1. This is a special case of a discrete distribution ; its probability mass function equals 1 in a and 0 everywhere else.

In the case of a real-valued random variable, the cumulative distribution function of the degenerate distribution localized in a is F a ( x ) = { 1 , if x ≥ ≥ a 0 , if x < a {\displaystyle F_{a}(x)=\left\{{\begin{matrix}1,&{\mbox{if }}x\geq a\\0,&{\mbox{if }}x<a\end{matrix}}\right.} Such degenerate distributions often arise as limits of continuous distributions whose variance goes to 0.

Constant random variable [ edit ] A constant random variable is a discrete random variable that takes a constant value, regardless of any event that occurs.  This is technically different from an almost surely constant random variable , which may take other values, but only on events with probability zero:
Let X : Ω → ℝ be a real-valued random variable defined on a probability space (Ω, ℙ) .  Then X is an almost surely constant random variable if there exists a ∈ ∈ R {\displaystyle a\in \mathbb {R} } such that P ( X = a ) = 1 , {\displaystyle \mathbb {P} (X=a)=1,} and is furthermore a constant random variable if X ( ω ω ) = a , ∀ ∀ ω ω ∈ ∈ Ω Ω .

{\displaystyle X(\omega )=a,\quad \forall \omega \in \Omega .} A constant random variable is almost surely constant, but the converse is not true, since if X is almost surely constant then there may still exist γ ∈ Ω such that X (γ) ≠ a .

For practical purposes, the distinction between X being constant or almost surely constant is unimportant, since these two situation correspond to the same degenerate distribution: the Dirac measure.

Higher dimensions [ edit ] Degeneracy of a multivariate distribution in n random variables arises when the support lies in a space of dimension less than n .

[ 1 ] This occurs when at least one of the variables is a deterministic function of the others. For example, in the 2-variable case suppose that Y = aX + b for scalar random variables X and Y and scalar constants a ≠ 0 and b ; here knowing the value of one of X or Y gives exact knowledge of the value of the other. All the possible points ( x , y ) fall on the one-dimensional line y = ax + b .

[ citation needed ] In general when one or more of n random variables are exactly linearly determined by the others, if the covariance matrix exists its rank is less than n [ 1 ] [ verification needed ] and its determinant is 0, so it is positive semi-definite but not positive definite, and the joint probability distribution is degenerate.

[ citation needed ] Degeneracy can also occur even with non-zero covariance. For example, when scalar X is symmetrically distributed about 0 and Y is exactly given by Y = X 2 , all possible points ( x , y ) fall on the parabola y = x 2 , which is a one-dimensional subset of the two-dimensional space.
