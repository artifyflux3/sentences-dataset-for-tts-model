[ 1 ] It reflects an increased interest in walking art and the growth of the field.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 1 ] Based at the University of East London , it has over 700 members from across the globe (though the majority of members are based in the United Kingdom ).

[ 6 ] The network maintains an active email discussion community through JISCmail .

[ 7 ] Founding [ edit ] In late 2007 a small group of artists in central London invited ‘all those who are interested in walking as a critical spatial practice ’ to its attend the first meeting of the WAN.

[ 8 ] It was further developed when Clare Qualmann and Mark Hunter successfully bid for Arts and Humanities Research Council funding in 2011.

[ 5 ] [ 9 ] This facilitated the international development of the network and allowed it to expand membership, develop a website and fund the Footwork research group.

[ 1 ] :80 Activities [ edit ] The Walking Artists Network works 'on the basis of events that having walking at their core (rather than arranging things at which people sit and listen to talking about walking)'.

[ 1 ] :80 This has resulted in 'a variety of walking based initiatives' that bring 'people together to walk'.

[ 1 ] :80 Step by Step (2014-2017) [ edit ] Step by Step was an interdisciplinary seminar series at the University of East London, organized by Clare Qualmann and Blake Morris . It brought together artists and academics whose work engaged with the practice of walking, including Kubra Khademi , Anna Minton and Sara Wookey .

[ 10 ] [ 1 ] :80 Walking Encyclopaedia (2014) [ edit ] In 2014, the Walking Artists Network collaborated with Airspace Gallery in Stoke-on-Trent to produce The Walking Encyclopaedia (2014), a gallery exhibition and online archive of walking practices that includes more than 150 walking practitioners and artworks.

[ 11 ] Ways to Wander (2015) [ edit ] In 2015 Triarchy Press published Ways to Wander, a collection of walk suggestions, experiences, techniques and case studies by members of the Walking Artists' Network.

[ 12 ] The book was an 'output of the AHRC funded 'Footwork' project, and edited by Qualmann and Claire Hind .

[ 13 ] WALKING WOMEN (2016) [ edit ] In 2016 Qualmann and Amy Sharrocks curated WALKING WOMEN, 'a series of walks talks and workshops  that featured  over forty women artists working with walking in a variety of media.' [ 1 ] :80 The event featured two programmes of work at Somerset House , London and Forest Fringe, Edinburgh.

[ 14 ] Artists presenting their work included Jennie Savage , Sharrocks, Deirdre Heddon , Kubra Khademi, Louise Ann Wilson , Rosana Cade , The Walking Reading Group on Participation , Monique Besten and Alison Lloyd. The Live Art Development Agency published a guide to WALKING WOMEN following the events. A radio programme featuring artists involved in the programme was broadcast on Resonance FM in July 2016.
