It plans to enter the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL), in the top flight of the United States league system , in 2026. Its home ground will be at a renovated White Stadium , though the club plans to play its inaugural season at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts during its redevelopment.

History [ edit ] Boston's second professional women's soccer club, the Boston Breakers , were founded in 2009, and competed in Women's Professional Soccer , Women's Premier Soccer League Elite , and the National Women's Soccer League .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] The club folded in 2017 due to a limited fanbase, with reports generally blaming a lack of marketing.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Boston Unity Soccer Partners put forward bids during the 2024 and 2026 rounds of National Women's Soccer League expansion – ultimately winning the latter.

[ 6 ] The club originally unveiled their name as BOS Nation FC in October 2024 – an anagram of Bostonian , and a play on boss .

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] Their branding was launched with a marketing campaign that sported the tagline , "there are too many balls in this town" .

[ 9 ] [ 7 ] While its intent was to highlight the patriarchal nature of sports in Boston , it was criticized by the LGBTQ community as transphobic , and by others for focusing on male athletes as opposed to highlighting Boston's existing and preceding women's sports teams.

[ 10 ] [ 11 ] Days after its branding launch, the club issued a public apology, and immediately discontinued the campaign.

[ 12 ] [ 13 ] Criticism of the club's branding also led to a rebranding, which was unveiled as Boston Legacy FC in March 2025.

[ 14 ] The team will begin in the 2026 season, alongside Denver Summit FC , which will bring the NWSL to a total of 16 teams.

[ 15 ] Stadium [ edit ] The team will play home matches in White Stadium in Franklin Park, Boston .

[ 6 ] The City of Boston planned to commit up to $50 million towards the stadium's renovation, and BUSP pledged $30 million.

[ 16 ] The stadium is to be the first venue in the country which will be home to a major league sports franchise and the athletic program of a public high school.

[ 16 ] The stadium will be shared with Boston Public Schools track and soccer.

[ 16 ] American football matches will be prohibited at the field during the professional soccer season, although high school football will be played on the field for playoffs and Thanksgiving games.

[ 16 ] The renovation of White Stadium sparked some dispute with community groups, and was met with a lawsuit from the Emerald Necklace Conservancy . The Conservancy sued both the City of Boston and the club's development partners, but were denied a preliminary injunction for their claims.

[ 17 ] [ 18 ] The presiding judge, Justice Matthew Nestor , stated that they were "not persuaded" of the Conservancy's claims that the renovations would cause irreparable harm in its violation of state law.

[ 19 ] In early April, the judge held that the renovation was not in violation of the law and that the project could proceed.

[ 20 ] The renovations will not be completed in time for the first season, and in May 2025 the team announced they would play their full first season at Gillette Stadium .

[ 21 ] Organization [ edit ] Boston Legacy FC are owned by Boston Unity Soccer Partners (BUSP), an all-female ownership group led by Jennifer Epstein , Stephanie Connaughton , Ami Danoff , and Anna Palmer .

[ 6 ] BUSP's investors include Aly Raisman , Elizabeth Banks , Brad and Tracy Stevens , and Linda Henry .

[ 7 ] In July 2025, WNBA All-Star, Aliyah Boston , joined the ownership group for the Legacy.

[ 22 ] Former FC Barcelona Femení recruitment and contract manager Domènec "Domè" Guasch serves as the club's general manager .

[ 23 ] The team's training facility will be located in Brockton and will open in 2026. It is privately funded and will include a 30,000-square-foot training building and six pitches, including two natural grass surfaces and one heated field.

[ 24 ] Players and staff [ edit ] Current squad [ edit ] As of August 11, 2025 Out on loan [ edit ] No.
