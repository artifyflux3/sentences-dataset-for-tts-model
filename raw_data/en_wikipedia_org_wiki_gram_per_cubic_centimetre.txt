SI units 1,000 kg/m 3 Imperial and US Customary units 62.42796 lb/cu ft MTS units 1 t/m 3 The gram per cubic centimetre is a unit of density in International System of Units (SI), and is commonly used in chemistry . Its official SI symbols are g/cm 3 , g·cm −3 , or g cm −3 . It is equal to the units gram per millilitre (g/mL) and kilogram per litre (kg/L). It is defined by dividing the gram , a unit of mass , by the cubic centimetre , a unit of volume . It is a coherent unit in the CGS system , but is not a coherent unit of the SI.

The density of water is approximately 1 g/cm 3 , since the gram was originally defined as the mass of one cubic centimetre of water at its maximum density at approximately 4 °C (39 °F).
