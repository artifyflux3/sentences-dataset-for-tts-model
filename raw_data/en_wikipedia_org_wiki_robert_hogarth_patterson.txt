Early life [ edit ] Born in Edinburgh in December 1821, Patterson was educated as a civil engineer at Edinburgh high school . When quite young he started in the printing-office of his cousin, John Ballantyne, as a press corrector. In 1852 he left the printing business to become editor of the Edinburgh Advertiser .

[ 1 ] London newspaper editor [ edit ] In 1858 Patterson moved to London as editor, and later proprietor, of The Press , owned by Benjamin Disraeli , after the death in 1857 of David Trevena Coulton .

[ 2 ] George Henry Townsend took it over from him about 1865.

[ 3 ] About that year Patterson may have become involved with The Globe , which he ran at some point with Francis Mahony and E. B. Moran (or E. R. Morgan). A London evening paper, it took a Conservative line.

[ 1 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] The details, however are not clear. The editors of this period, during the 1860s, of The Globe included: Charles Wescomb; Henry Barnett, minister of South Place Chapel; Patterson; and Marbrook Tucker.

[ 6 ] Later life [ edit ] Patterson resigned from The Globe in 1869, to join a board appointed by parliament to investigate and report on the purification of coal-gas in London. The outcome was a process for the elimination of sulphur and ammonia impurities from gas.

[ 1 ] In 1872 Patterson went to Glasgow as editor of the Glasgow News , but his health broke down and he returned to London in 1874. He went on contributing articles, on politics, finance, science, and history, to periodicals. A reputed financial expert, he was consulted by both the Bank of England and the Bank of France on financial and currency questions, and was elected a fellow, and afterwards a member of council, of the Statistical Society .

[ 1 ] As a financial journalist he belonged to the generation of Hyde Clarke , David Morier Evans and William Newmarch , who debated abstract finance; their successors were Walter Bagehot , Arthur Crump, Arthur Ellis and Robert Giffen , concerned rather with realistic reporting on the City of London.

[ 7 ] Patterson died at Hammersmith on 13 December 1886. He had married, in 1848, Georgina, daughter of Captain Thomson of Perth .

[ 1 ] Works [ edit ] Patterson was the author of: [ 1 ] The New Revolution; or the Napoleonic Policy in Europe , Edinburgh and London, 1860. A review in The Economist identified it as edited from published leaders and articles from The Press and Blackwood's Magazine ; and as hostile to Napoleon III .

[ 8 ] It attracted attention, because of the fulfilment, soon after publication, of some of its predictions.

[ 1 ] Essays in History and Art , Edinburgh, 1862, reprinted from Blackwood's Magazine .

The Economy of Capital; or Gold and Trade , Edinburgh, 1865. The work predicted a period of globalisation , in the form of greater commercial links between Europe and Asia driven by gold discoveries.

[ 9 ] The Science of Finance , Edinburgh, 1868.

Railway Finance , Edinburgh, 1868.

The State, the Poor, and the Country, including Suggestions on the Irish Question , Edinburgh, 1870.

Gas and Lighting ( British Manufacturing Industries series ), London, 1876.

The New Golden Age and the Influence of the Precious Metals upon the World , 2 vols., Edinburgh, 1882.

Patterson was also the author of pamphlets: [ 1 ] Indian Politics: two essays on Self-Government in India and the Indian Land Question , 2 pts. 1864; Municipal Finance; the Gas and Water Supply of London , 1867; Gas Purification in London, including a Complete Solution of the Sulphur Question , Edinburgh, 1873, 2nd edit. 1874; Robespierre: a Lyrical Drama , 1877; and Light Theories: Suggestions for a New System of Cosmical Science .

In early life Patterson contributed articles to Chambers's Edinburgh Journal ; and later he wrote for the Quarterly Review , Blackwood's Magazine , Bentley's Miscellany , and the Dublin University Magazine .

[ 1 ] His essay on aesthetics "On Real and Ideal Beauty" first appeared in Blackwood's , and was praised by William Angus Knight ; it promoted the theories of David Ramsay Hay .
