[ 11 ] [ 20 ] The area was officially named New Barbadoes Township until 1921, but has informally been known as Hackensack since at least the 18th century.

[ 21 ] As of the 2020 United States census , the city's population was 46,030, [ 10 ] [ 11 ] its highest decennial count ever and an increase of 3,020 (+7.0%) from the 2010 census count of 43,010, [ 22 ] [ 23 ] which in turn reflected an increase of 333 (+0.8%) from the 42,677 counted in the 2000 census .

[ 24 ] An inner suburb of New York City , Hackensack is located approximately 12 miles (19 km) northwest of Midtown Manhattan and about 7 miles (11 km) from the George Washington Bridge .

[ 25 ] From a number of locations, including portions of Prospect Avenue, the New York City skyline can be seen.

[ 25 ] The Metropolitan Campus of Fairleigh Dickinson University straddles the Hackensack River in both Hackensack and Teaneck . Hackensack is also the home of the former New Jersey Naval Museum and the World War II submarine USS Ling . Astronaut Wally Schirra is perhaps Hackensack's most famous native son .

[ 26 ] The city has diverse neighborhoods and land uses located close to one another. Within its borders are the Hackensack University Medical Center , a residential high-rise district about a mile long (along Prospect Avenue between Beech Street and Passaic Street), suburban neighborhoods of single-family houses, stately older homes on acre-plus lots, older two-family neighborhoods, large garden apartment complexes, industrial areas, the Bergen County Jail, a tidal river , Hackensack River County Park, Borg's Woods Nature Preserve, various city parks, large office buildings, a major college campus, the Bergen County Court House , a vibrant small-city downtown district, and various small neighborhood business districts.

[ 27 ] History [ edit ] Hackensack map c.

1896 The earliest known inhabitants of the area were the Lenni Lenape , an Algonquian people who became known to settlers as 'the Delaware Indians.' They lived along a river they called Achinigeu-hach , or " Ackingsah-sack ", which translates to stony ground —today this river is more commonly known by the name 'the Hackensack River .' [ 28 ] A representation of Chief Oratam of the Achkinhenhcky appears on the Hackensack municipal seal. The most common explanation is that the city was named for the Native American tribe, [ 29 ] [ 30 ] though other sources attribute it to a Native American word variously translated as meaning "hook mouth", "stream that unites with another on low ground", "on low ground" or "land of the big snake", [ 31 ] [ 32 ] while another version described as "more colorful than probable" attributes the name to an inn called the "Hock and Sack".

[ 33 ] Settlement by the Dutch West India Company in New Netherland on the west banks of the Hudson River across from New Amsterdam (present-day lower Manhattan ) began in the 1630s at Pavonia , eventually leading to the establishment of Bergen (at today's Bergen Square in Jersey City ) in 1660.

[ 34 ] Oratam, sachem of the Lenni Lenape, deeded the land along mid- Hackensack River to the Dutch in 1665. The area was soon taken by the English in 1667, but kept its Dutch name.

Philip Cartaret , governor of what became the proprietary colony of East Jersey granted land to Captain John Berry in the area of Achter Kol [ 35 ] and soon after took up residence and called it " New Barbadoes ," after having resided on the island of Barbados . In 1666, a deed was confirmed for the 2,260-acre (9.1 km 2 ) tract that had been given earlier by Oratem to Sarah Kiersted in gratitude for her work as emissary and interpreter.

[ 36 ] [ 37 ] Other grants were given at the English Neighborhood .

[ 38 ] [ 39 ] [ 40 ] In 1675, the East Jersey Legislature established the administrative districts Bergen , Essex , Middlesex , and Monmouth . In 1683, Bergen (along with the three other counties) was officially recognized as an independent county by the Provincial Assembly.

[ 41 ] The seal of Bergen County bearing this date includes an image of an agreement between the European settlers and the Native Americans.

[ 42 ] New Barbadoes Township , together with Acquackanonk Township , were formed by Royal charter on October 31, 1693.

[ 43 ] [ 44 ] In 1700, the village of Hackensack was little more than the area around Main Street from the Courthouse to around Anderson Street. New Barbadoes Township included what is now Maywood , Rochelle Park , Paramus and River Edge , along with those portions of Oradell that are west of the Hackensack River. These areas were all sparsely populated and consisted of farm fields, woods and swamplands. The few roads that existed then included the streets now known as Kinderkamack Road, Paramus Road/Passaic Street and Essex Street. The southernmost portions of what is now Hackensack were not part of New Barbadoes Township at that time and were acquired in the late 1800s.

[ 43 ] The neighborhood that came to be known as the village of Hackensack (today the area encompassing Bergen County's municipal buildings in Hackensack) was a part of Essex County until 1710, when Bergen County, by royal decree of Queen Anne of Great Britain , was enlarged and the Township of New Barbadoes was removed from Essex County and added to Bergen County.

[ 45 ] In 1710, the village of Hackensack (in the newly formed Township of New Barbadoes) was designated as being more centrally located and more easily reached by the majority of the Bergen County's inhabitants and, hence, was chosen as the county seat of Bergen County, as it remains today.  The earliest records of the Bergen County Board of Chosen Freeholders date back to 1715, at which time agreement was made to build a courthouse and jail complex, which was completed in 1716.

[ 46 ] During the American Revolutionary War , George Washington headquartered in the village of Hackensack in November 1776 during the retreat from Fort Lee via New Bridge Landing and camped on 'The Green' across from the First Dutch Reformed Church on November 20, 1776. A raid by British forces against Hackensack on March 23, 1780, resulted in the destruction by fire of the original courthouse structure.

[ 47 ] Article in The Street Railway Review of July 1900 The Hackensack Improvement Commission was incorporated by an Act of the state legislature approved on April 1, 1868, within New Barbadoes township and including the village of Hackensack, with authority to develop sewers and other improvements in Hackensack.

[ 48 ] The New Jersey Legislature passed the Township School Act in 1894, under which each village, borough, town, or city in New Jersey was delegated responsibility for its own public schools through the office of the county superintendent. Hackensack established a local board of education in 1894, as required by the new law, which took over operation of schools located in the township and established Hackensack High School .

[ 49 ] The 1894 act allowed local residents, by petition, to change municipal boundaries at will, setting off fearsome political battles statewide.

Portions of the township had been taken to form Harrington Township (June 22, 1775), Lodi Township (March 1, 1826), Midland Township (March 7, 1871) and Little Ferry (September 20, 1894).

[ 43 ] After these departures, secessions, and de-annexations, all that was left of New Barbadoes Township was the village of Hackensack and its surrounding neighborhoods of Fairmount, Red Hill and Cherry Hill. In 1896, New Barbadoes acquired a portion of Lodi Township covering an area south of Essex Street from the bend of Essex Street to the Maywood border. That same year the Hackensack Improvement commission was abolished and the City of Hackensack and New Barbadoes Township became coterminous.

[ 50 ] [ 51 ] The final parcel lost by New Barbadoes Township was the northeastern corner of what is now Little Ferry, which was incorporated in September 1894.

[ 52 ] An act of the State Legislature incorporated the Fairmount section of New Barbadoes with the Hackensack Improvement Commission, and eliminated New Barbadoes Township as a political entity. On November 21, 1921, based on the results of a referendum held on November 8, 1921, New Barbadoes Township received its charter to incorporate as a city and officially took on its name "Hackensack," a name derived from its original inhabitants, the Lenni Lenape, who named it " Ackingsah-sack ".

[ 43 ] In 1933, Hackensack adopted the Manager form of government under the terms of the 1923 Municipal Manager Law , with five Council persons all elected at-large and a mayor selected by the council from among its members.

[ 53 ] The Sears location on Main Street, which opened on October 27, 1932, and was the last freestanding Sears in the state of New Jersey, closed on September 12, 2020.

[ 54 ] [ 55 ] Geography [ edit ] Aerial view of Hackensack According to the United States Census Bureau , the city had a total area of 4.35 square miles (11.27 km 2 ), including 4.19 square miles (10.86 km 2 ) of land and 0.16 square miles (0.41 km 2 ) of water (3.63%).

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] The city is bordered by the Bergen County municipalities of Bogota , Hasbrouck Heights , Little Ferry , Lodi , Maywood , Paramus , Ridgefield Park , River Edge , South Hackensack , Teaneck and Teterboro .

[ 56 ] [ 57 ] [ 58 ] There are many houses of historic value, and some of these were identified in the 1990 Master Plan. The city does not have any registered historic districts, or any restrictions on preserving the historic facade in any portions of the city.  Areas considered suburban single-family residential neighborhoods account for about one-third of the city's area, mostly along its western side.

Unincorporated communities , localities and place names located partially or completely within the city include Fairmount and North Hackensack .

[ 43 ] Ethnic diversity [ edit ] As the initial destination for many immigrants to Bergen County from around the globe, Hackensack's ethnic composition has become exceptionally diverse. As of 2013, approximately 38.9% of the population were foreign-born. In addition, 2.5% were born in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico or abroad to American parents. Over half, 51.7%, of the population over the age of five speak only English in their household, while 32.5% of the population speak Spanish at home.

[ 71 ] The South Asian and East Asian populations have increased most rapidly in Hackensack since 2000, with nearly 2,000 Indian Americans , over 1,000 Filipino Americans , and over 600 Korean Americans represented in the 2010 United States Census.

[ 72 ] Hackensack's Hispanic population has also risen rapidly, to over 15,000 in 2010; [ 72 ] Ecuadoreans , Dominicans , and Colombians have become the top Hispanic groups in northern Hackensack.

[ 73 ] The Black population dropped as a percentage, although minimally in absolute numbers between 2000 and 2010.

[ 72 ] The city lost approximately 10% of its White population between 2000 and 2010, which has stabilized and resumed growth since 2010 and has remained substantial, at over 20,000 in 2010.

[ 72 ] The city has also witnessed greatly increasing diversity in its non-Hispanic white segment, with large numbers of Eastern Europeans , Eurasians , Central Asians , and Arabic immigrants offsetting the loss in Hackensack's earlier established Italian American , Irish American , and German American populations.

[ 74 ] Same-sex couples headed 145 households in 2010, an increase from the 112 counted in 2000.

[ 75 ] 2000 census [ edit ] As of the 2000 United States census , [ 17 ] there were 42,677 people, 18,113 households, and 9,545 families residing in the city. The population density was 10,358.3 inhabitants per square mile (3,999.4/km 2 ). There were 18,945 housing units at an average density of 4,598.2 per square mile (1,775.4/km 2 ).

[ 69 ] [ 70 ] Parks and recreation [ edit ] Borg's Woods Nature Preserve is a wooded municipal park covering 15 acres (6.1 ha).

[ 76 ] [ 77 ] Efforts to create the park date back to a 1979 study that showed that the city had less parkland available to residents than specified by benchmarks.

[ 78 ] Government [ edit ] Local government [ edit ] Hackensack operates under the 1923 Municipal Manager Law form of New Jersey municipal government. The city is one of seven municipalities (of the 564) statewide that use this form of government.

[ 79 ] The City Council is comprised of five members who are elected to four-year terms on a concurrent basis in a non-partisan election held every four years in May.

[ 7 ] [ 80 ] [ 81 ] This form of government separates policy making (the work of the mayor and city council) from the execution of policy (the work of the city manager). This maintains professional management and a Citywide perspective through: nonpartisan election, at-large representation, concentration of executive responsibility in the hands of a professional manager accountable to the Mayor and Council, concentration of policy making power in one body: a five-person Mayor and Council.

[ 82 ] In the several decades since the city adopted the Municipal Manager form of government, Hackensack has had only nine City Managers.

As of 2025 [update] , the mayor of the City of Hackensack is Caseen Gaines, whose term of office as mayor ends June 30, 2029, along with those of all other councilmembers. The other members of the Hackensack City Council are Deputy Mayor Agatha Toomey, Philip Carroll, Sonya Clark-Collins and Roberto Diaz.

[ 4 ] [ 83 ] [ 84 ] In an election that focused on development and the use of payment in lieu of taxes agreements to developers, the challenger's Hackensack Unites slate of Philip Carroll, Sonya Clark-Collins, Roberto Diaz, Caseen Gaines and Agatha Toomey defeated a slate led by three-term mayor John Labrosse.

[ 85 ] Led by Mayor Labrosse, a team of candidates including four incumbents (and one newcomer) won the May 2021 municipal election. The winning slate defeated two other groups of five candidates, one of which was led by former deputy mayor David Sims.

[ 86 ] The May 2017 election was won by the Labrosse Team, which include the mayor and three other incumbents, joined by one newcomer.

[ 87 ] In April 2015, the city council selected Jason Some on an interim basis to fill the vacant seat of Rose Greenman, who had resigned the previous month citing claims that her council colleagues had discriminated against her.

[ 88 ] In the November 2015 general election, Deborah Keeling-Geddis was elected to serve the balance of the term of office, edging interim councilmember Jason Some by 24 votes in the final count, with four candidates running for the seat.

[ 89 ] [ 90 ] City Council candidate Joseph DeFalco, principal of Hackensack High School, died of a heart attack the day of the municipal election in 2005, but was elected despite his death.

[ 91 ] Calvin Coles, who had received the sixth highest number of votes, sued in Superior Court, claiming he should be elected as he received the sixth highest number of vote. However, the Court held that DeFalco's death created a vacancy on the Council to be filled in accordance with the Municipal Vacancy Law. DeFalco's running mates appointed Charles P. McAuliffe to the Council. McAuliffe served for four years.

[2] . The Council members agreed to create a rotation under which each of the four surviving members of the New Visions for Hackensack slate would serve for a year as Mayor, creating a series of firsts for the City. . Townes took office in 2005 as the city's first black mayor, and Sasso became the first female mayor in 2006. Meneses became Hackensack's first Hispanic mayor when he was sworn in on July 1, 2007, and Melfi took the reins as mayor in 2008.

[ 92 ] Four of the same five officials were re-elected in 2009 (Townes, Melfi, Sasso, Meneses), along with one opposition candidate, LaBrosse. The city council continued to rotate the mayor's seat, with the exception of Labrosse, and Melfi became mayor again in 2012.

Walter E. Nowakowski served as mayor from 1965-1969, [ citation needed ] Frank Zisa served as mayor from 1977 to 1981, [ 93 ] Fred Cerbo from 1981 to 1989, [ 94 ] and John F. "Jack" Zisa (son of Frank Zisa) from 1989 to 2005.

[ 95 ] Former Assemblyman Charles "Ken" Zisa served as chief of the Hackensack Police Department from his 1995 appointment to replace John Aletta until May 2010 when he was suspended without pay on charges of official misconduct and insurance fraud. Tomas Padilla was appointed the acting police chief while the police department was being monitored by the Bergen County Prosecutors office. In May 2012, a judge ordered Zisa out of his position as police chief, a decision that cost him his police retirement benefits.

[ 96 ] [ 97 ] [ 98 ] In January 2013, Mike Mordaga was appointed the new civilian police director, which replaced the previous position of police chief.

[ 99 ] Federal, state and county representation [ edit ] Hackensack is located in the 5th Congressional District [ 100 ] and is part of New Jersey's 37th state legislative district.

[ 101 ] [ 102 ] [ 103 ] For the 119th United States Congress , New Jersey's 5th congressional district is represented by Josh Gottheimer ( D , Tenafly ).

[ 104 ] [ 105 ] New Jersey is represented in the United States Senate by Democrats Cory Booker ( Newark , term ends 2027) and Andy Kim ( Moorestown , term ends 2031).

[ 106 ] For the 2024-2025 session , the 37th legislative district of the New Jersey Legislature is represented in the New Jersey Senate by Gordon M. Johnson ( D , Englewood ) and in the General Assembly by Shama Haider (D, Tenafly ) and Ellen Park (D, Englewood Cliffs ).

[ 107 ] Bergen County is governed by a directly elected County Executive , with legislative functions performed by a Board of County Commissioners composed of seven members who are elected at-large to three-year terms in partisan elections on a staggered basis, with either two or three seats coming up for election each November; a Chairman and Vice Chairman are selected from among its seven members at a reorganization meeting held every January. As of 2025 [update] , the county executive is James J. Tedesco III ( D , Paramus ), whose four-year term of office ends December 31, 2026.
