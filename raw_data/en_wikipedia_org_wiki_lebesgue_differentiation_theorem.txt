The theorem is named for Henri Lebesgue .

Statement [ edit ] For a Lebesgue integrable real or complex-valued function f on R n , the indefinite integral is a set function which maps a measurable set A to the Lebesgue integral of f ⋅ ⋅ 1 A {\displaystyle f\cdot \mathbf {1} _{A}} , where 1 A {\displaystyle \mathbf {1} _{A}} denotes the characteristic function of the set A . It is usually written A ↦ ↦ ∫ ∫ A f d λ λ , {\displaystyle A\mapsto \int _{A}f\ \mathrm {d} \lambda ,} with λ the n –dimensional Lebesgue measure .

The derivative of this integral at x is defined to be lim B → → x 1 | B | ∫ ∫ B f d λ λ , {\displaystyle \lim _{B\to x}{\frac {1}{|B|}}\int _{B}f\,\mathrm {d} \lambda ,} where | B | denotes the volume (i.e., the Lebesgue measure) of a ball B centered at x , and B → x means that the diameter of B tends to 0.

The Lebesgue differentiation theorem ( Lebesgue 1910 ) states that this derivative exists and is equal to f ( x ) at almost every point x ∈ R n .

[ 1 ] In fact a slightly stronger statement is true. Note that: | 1 | B | ∫ ∫ B f ( y ) d λ λ ( y ) − − f ( x ) | = | 1 | B | ∫ ∫ B ( f ( y ) − − f ( x ) ) d λ λ ( y ) | ≤ ≤ 1 | B | ∫ ∫ B | f ( y ) − − f ( x ) | d λ λ ( y ) .

{\displaystyle \left|{\frac {1}{|B|}}\int _{B}f(y)\,\mathrm {d} \lambda (y)-f(x)\right|=\left|{\frac {1}{|B|}}\int _{B}(f(y)-f(x))\,\mathrm {d} \lambda (y)\right|\leq {\frac {1}{|B|}}\int _{B}|f(y)-f(x)|\,\mathrm {d} \lambda (y).} The stronger assertion is that the right hand side tends to zero for almost every point x . The points x for which this is true are called the Lebesgue points of f .

A more general version also holds. One may replace the balls B by a family V {\displaystyle {\mathcal {V}}} of sets U of bounded eccentricity . This means that there exists some fixed c > 0 such that each set U from the family is contained in a ball B with | U | ≥ ≥ c | B | {\displaystyle |U|\geq c\,|B|} .  It is also assumed that every point x ∈ R n is contained in arbitrarily small sets from V {\displaystyle {\mathcal {V}}} . When these sets shrink to x , the same result holds: for almost every point x , f ( x ) = lim U → → x , U ∈ ∈ V 1 | U | ∫ ∫ U f d λ λ .

{\displaystyle f(x)=\lim _{U\to x,\,U\in {\mathcal {V}}}{\frac {1}{|U|}}\int _{U}f\,\mathrm {d} \lambda .} The family of cubes is an example of such a family V {\displaystyle {\mathcal {V}}} , as is the family V {\displaystyle {\mathcal {V}}} ( m ) of rectangles in R 2 such that the ratio of sides stays between m −1 and m , for some fixed m ≥ 1. If an arbitrary norm is given on R n , the family of balls for the metric associated to the norm is another example.

The one-dimensional case was proved earlier by Lebesgue (1904) . If f is integrable on the real line, the function F ( x ) = ∫ ∫ ( − − ∞ ∞ , x ] f ( t ) d t {\displaystyle F(x)=\int _{(-\infty ,x]}f(t)\,\mathrm {d} t} is almost everywhere differentiable, with F ′ ( x ) = f ( x ) .

{\displaystyle F'(x)=f(x).} Were F {\displaystyle F} defined by a Riemann integral this would be essentially the fundamental theorem of calculus , but Lebesgue proved that it remains true when using the Lebesgue integral.

[ 2 ] Proof [ edit ] The theorem in its stronger form—that almost every point is a Lebesgue point of a locally integrable function f —can be proved as a consequence of the weak– L 1 estimates for the Hardy–Littlewood maximal function .  The proof below follows the standard treatment that can be found in Benedetto & Czaja (2009) , Stein & Shakarchi (2005) , Wheeden & Zygmund (1977) and Rudin (1987) .

Since the statement is local in character, f can be assumed to be  zero outside some ball of finite radius and hence integrable. It is then sufficient to prove that the set E α α = { x ∈ ∈ R n : lim sup | B | → → 0 , x ∈ ∈ B 1 | B | | ∫ ∫ B f ( y ) − − f ( x ) d y | > 2 α α } {\displaystyle E_{\alpha }={\Bigl \{}x\in \mathbf {R} ^{n}:\limsup _{|B|\rightarrow 0,\,x\in B}{\frac {1}{|B|}}{\bigg |}\int _{B}f(y)-f(x)\,\mathrm {d} y{\bigg |}>2\alpha {\Bigr \}}} has measure 0 for all α > 0.

Let ε > 0 be given. Using the density of continuous functions of compact support in L 1 ( R n ) , one can find such a function g satisfying ‖ ‖ f − − g ‖ ‖ L 1 = ∫ ∫ R n | f ( x ) − − g ( x ) | d x < ε ε .

{\displaystyle \|f-g\|_{L^{1}}=\int _{\mathbf {R} ^{n}}|f(x)-g(x)|\,\mathrm {d} x<\varepsilon .} It is then helpful to rewrite the main difference as 1 | B | ∫ ∫ B f ( y ) d y − − f ( x ) = ( 1 | B | ∫ ∫ B ( f ( y ) − − g ( y ) ) d y ) + ( 1 | B | ∫ ∫ B g ( y ) d y − − g ( x ) ) + ( g ( x ) − − f ( x ) ) .

{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{|B|}}\int _{B}f(y)\,\mathrm {d} y-f(x)={\Bigl (}{\frac {1}{|B|}}\int _{B}{\bigl (}f(y)-g(y){\bigr )}\,\mathrm {d} y{\Bigr )}+{\Bigl (}{\frac {1}{|B|}}\int _{B}g(y)\,\mathrm {d} y-g(x){\Bigr )}+{\bigl (}g(x)-f(x){\bigr )}.} The first term can be bounded by the value at x of the maximal function for f − g , denoted here by ( f − − g ) ∗ ∗ ( x ) {\displaystyle (f-g)^{*}(x)} : 1 | B | ∫ ∫ B | f ( y ) − − g ( y ) | d y ≤ ≤ sup r > 0 1 | B r ( x ) | ∫ ∫ B r ( x ) | f ( y ) − − g ( y ) | d y = ( f − − g ) ∗ ∗ ( x ) .

{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{|B|}}\int _{B}|f(y)-g(y)|\,\mathrm {d} y\leq \sup _{r>0}{\frac {1}{|B_{r}(x)|}}\int _{B_{r}(x)}|f(y)-g(y)|\,\mathrm {d} y=(f-g)^{*}(x).} The second term disappears in the limit since g is a continuous function, and the third term is bounded by | f ( x ) − g ( x )|. For the absolute value of the original difference to be greater than 2 α in the limit, at least one of the first or third terms must be greater than α in absolute value. However, the estimate on the Hardy–Littlewood function says that | { x : ( f − − g ) ∗ ∗ ( x ) > α α } | ≤ ≤ A n α α ‖ ‖ f − − g ‖ ‖ L 1 < A n α α ε ε , {\displaystyle {\Bigl |}\left\{x:(f-g)^{*}(x)>\alpha \right\}{\Bigr |}\leq {\frac {A_{n}}{\alpha }}\,\|f-g\|_{L^{1}}<{\frac {A_{n}}{\alpha }}\,\varepsilon ,} for some constant A n depending only upon the dimension n .  The Markov inequality (also called Tchebyshev's inequality) says that | { x : | f ( x ) − − g ( x ) | > α α } | ≤ ≤ 1 α α ‖ ‖ f − − g ‖ ‖ L 1 < 1 α α ε ε {\displaystyle {\Bigl |}\left\{x:|f(x)-g(x)|>\alpha \right\}{\Bigr |}\leq {\frac {1}{\alpha }}\,\|f-g\|_{L^{1}}<{\frac {1}{\alpha }}\,\varepsilon } thus | E α α | ≤ ≤ A n + 1 α α ε ε .

{\displaystyle |E_{\alpha }|\leq {\frac {A_{n}+1}{\alpha }}\,\varepsilon .} Since ε was arbitrary, it can be taken to be arbitrarily small, and the theorem follows.

Discussion of proof [ edit ] The Vitali covering lemma is vital to the proof of this theorem; its role lies in proving the estimate for the Hardy–Littlewood maximal function .

The theorem also holds if balls are replaced, in the definition of the derivative, by families of  sets with diameter tending to zero satisfying the Lebesgue's regularity condition , defined above as family of sets with bounded eccentricity . This follows since the same substitution can be made in the statement of the Vitali covering lemma.

Discussion [ edit ] This is an analogue, and a generalization, of the fundamental theorem of calculus , which equates a Riemann integrable function and the derivative of its (indefinite) integral. It is also possible to show a converse – that every differentiable function is equal to the integral of its derivative, but this requires a Henstock–Kurzweil integral in order to be able to integrate an arbitrary derivative.

A special case of the Lebesgue differentiation theorem is the Lebesgue density theorem , which is equivalent to the differentiation theorem for characteristic functions of measurable sets. The density theorem is usually proved using a simpler method (e.g. see Measure and Category).

This theorem is also true for every finite Borel measure on R n instead of Lebesgue measure (a proof can be found in e.g. ( Ledrappier & Young 1985 )). More generally, it is true of any finite Borel measure on a separable metric space such that at least one of the following holds: the metric space is a Riemannian manifold , the metric space is a locally compact ultrametric space , the measure is doubling .

A proof of these results can be found in sections 2.8–2.9 of (Federer 1969).
