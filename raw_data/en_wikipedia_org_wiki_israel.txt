Israel , [ a ] officially the State of Israel , [ b ] is a country in the Southern Levant region of West Asia . It shares borders with Lebanon to the north, Syria to the north-east, Jordan to the east, Egypt to the south-west and the Mediterranean Sea to the west.

It occupies the Palestinian territories of the West Bank in the east and the Gaza Strip in the south-west, as well as the Syrian Golan Heights in the northeast. Israel also has a small coastline on the Red Sea at its southernmost point, and part of the Dead Sea lies along its eastern border.

Its proclaimed capital is Jerusalem , [ 22 ] while Tel Aviv is its largest urban area and economic centre .

Israel is located in a region known as the Land of Israel , synonymous with Canaan , the Holy Land , the Palestine region , and Judea . In antiquity it was home to the Canaanite civilisation, followed by the kingdoms of Israel and Judah . Situated at a continental crossroad , the region experienced demographic changes under the rule of empires from the Romans to the Ottomans .

European antisemitism in the late 19th century galvanised Zionism , which sought to establish a homeland for the Jewish people in Palestine and gained British support with the Balfour Declaration . After World War I , Britain occupied the region and established Mandatory Palestine in 1920. Increased Jewish immigration in the lead-up to the Holocaust and British foreign policy in the Middle East led to intercommunal conflict between Jews and Arabs , [ 23 ] [ 24 ] which escalated into a civil war in 1947 after the United Nations (UN) proposed partitioning the land between them.

After the end of the British Mandate for Palestine , Israel declared independence on 14 May 1948. Neighbouring Arab states invaded the area the next day, beginning the First Arab–Israeli War . An armistice in 1949 left Israel in control of more territory than the UN partition plan had called for; [ 25 ] and no new independent Arab state was created as the rest of the former Mandate territory was held by Egypt and Jordan , respectively the Gaza Strip and the West Bank .

[ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ] The majority of Palestinian Arabs either fled or were expelled in what is known as the Nakba , with those remaining becoming the new state's main minority.

[ 28 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] Over the following decades, Israel's population increased greatly as the country received an influx of Jews who emigrated, fled or were expelled from the Arab world .

[ 31 ] [ 32 ] Following the 1967 Six-Day War , Israel occupied the West Bank, Gaza Strip, Egyptian Sinai Peninsula and Syrian Golan Heights . After the 1973 Yom Kippur War , Israel signed peace treaties with Egypt —returning the Sinai in 1982— and Jordan . In 1993, Israel signed the Oslo Accords , which established mutual recognition and limited Palestinian self-governance in parts of the West Bank and Gaza. In the 2020s, it normalised relations with several more Arab countries via the Abraham Accords . However, efforts to resolve the Israeli–Palestinian conflict after the interim Oslo Accords have not succeeded, and the country has engaged in several wars and clashes with Palestinian militant groups . Israel established and continues to expand settlements across the illegally occupied territories , contrary to international law, and has effectively annexed East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights in moves largely unrecognised internationally. Israel's practices in its occupation of the Palestinian territories have drawn sustained international criticism —along with accusations that it has committed war crimes , crimes against humanity, and genocide against the Palestinian people —from experts, human rights organisations and UN officials.

The country's Basic Laws establish a parliament elected by proportional representation , the Knesset , which determines the makeup of the government headed by the prime minister and elects the figurehead president .

[ 33 ] Israel has one of the largest economies in the Middle East, [ 34 ] one of the highest standards of living in Asia , the world's 26th-largest economy by nominal GDP and 16th by nominal GDP per capita .

[ 19 ] [ 35 ] One of the most technologically advanced and developed countries globally, Israel spends proportionally more on research and development than any other country in the world.

[ 36 ] [ 37 ] It is widely believed to possess nuclear weapons .

Israeli culture comprises Jewish and Jewish diaspora elements alongside Arab influences.

Etymology Further information: Israel (name) and Names of the Levant § Israel and Judea The names Land of Israel and Children of Israel have historically been used to refer to the biblical Kingdom of Israel and the entire Jewish people respectively. The name Israel (Hebrew: Yīsrāʾēl ; Septuagint Ancient Greek : Ἰσραήλ , Israēl , " El (God) persists/rules") refers to the patriarch Jacob who, according to the Hebrew Bible , was given the name after he successfully wrestled with the Angel of the Lord .

[ 38 ] The earliest known archaeological artefact to mention the word Israel as a collective is the Merneptah Stele of ancient Egypt (dated to the late-13th century BCE).

[ 39 ] [ 40 ] [ 41 ] [ fn 5 ] [ 43 ] Under the British Mandate (1920–1948), the entire region was known as Palestine .

[ 44 ] Upon establishment in 1948 , the country formally adopted the name State of Israel ( Hebrew : מְדִינַת יִשְׂרָאֵל , Medīnat Yisrā'el ⓘ [mediˈnat jisʁaˈʔel] ; Arabic : دَوْلَة إِسْرَائِيل , Dawlat Isrāʼīl , [dawlat ʔisraːˈʔiːl] ) after other proposed names including Land of Israel ( Eretz Israel ), Ever (from ancestor Eber ), Zion , and Judea , were considered but rejected.

[ 45 ] The name Israel was suggested by David Ben-Gurion and passed by a vote of 6–3.

[ 46 ] In the early weeks after establishment, the government chose the term Israeli to denote a citizen of the state.

[ 47 ] History Main article: History of Israel For a chronological guide, see Timeline of Israeli history .

Prehistory Further information: Prehistory of the Levant The Ubeidiya prehistoric site in Israel indicates the presence of archaic humans around 1.5 million years ago.

[ 48 ] The second-oldest evidence of anatomically modern humans found outside Africa is a 200,000-year-old fossil from Misliya Cave .

[ 49 ] The Natufian culture ( c.

10,000 BCE) introduced sedentism and may have been linked to Proto-Afroasiatic language .

[ 50 ] [ 51 ] The beginning of agriculture in the region during the Neolithic Revolution is evidenced by sites such as Nahal Oren .

[ 52 ] Bronze and Iron Ages Main article: History of ancient Israel and Judah Tel Megiddo , the ruins of a Canaanite and later Israelite city Early references to " Canaan " and "Canaanites" appear in ancient Near Eastern and Egyptian texts ( c.

2000 BCE); these populations were structured as politically independent city-states .

[ 53 ] [ 54 ] During the Late Bronze Age (1550–1200 BCE), large parts of Canaan formed vassal states of the New Kingdom of Egypt .

[ 55 ] As a result of the Late Bronze Age collapse , Canaan fell into chaos, and Egyptian control over the region collapsed.

[ 56 ] [ 57 ] Ancestors of the Israelites are thought to have included ancient Semitic-speaking peoples native to this area.

[ 58 ] : 78–79 Modern archaeological accounts suggest that the Israelites and their culture branched out of the Canaanite peoples through the development of a distinct monolatristic —and later monotheistic —religion centered on Yahweh .

[ 59 ] [ 60 ] They spoke an archaic form of Hebrew , known as Biblical Hebrew .

[ 61 ] Around the same time, the Philistines settled on the southern coastal plain .

[ 62 ] [ 63 ] Most modern scholars agree that the Exodus narrative in the Torah and Old Testament did not take place as depicted; however, some elements of these traditions do have historical roots .

[ 64 ] [ 65 ] There is debate about the earliest existence of the Kingdoms of Israel and Judah and their extent and power. While it is unclear if there was a United Kingdom of Israel , [ 66 ] [ 67 ] historians and archaeologists agree that the northern Kingdom of Israel existed by ca.

900 BCE [ 68 ] : 169–195 and the Kingdom of Judah by ca.

850 BCE.

[ 69 ] [ 70 ] The Kingdom of Israel was the more prosperous of the two and soon developed into a regional power, with a capital at Samaria ; [ 71 ] [ 72 ] [ 73 ] during the Omride dynasty , it controlled Samaria , Galilee , the upper Jordan Valley , the plain of Sharon and large parts of Transjordan .

[ 72 ] The Kingdom of Israel was conquered around 720 BCE by the Neo-Assyrian Empire .

[ 74 ] The Kingdom of Judah, under Davidic rule with its capital in Jerusalem , later became a client state of first the Neo-Assyrian Empire and then the Neo-Babylonian Empire . It is estimated that the region's population was around 400,000 in the Iron Age II .

[ 75 ] In 587/6 BCE, following a revolt in Judah , King Nebuchadnezzar II besieged and destroyed Jerusalem and Solomon's Temple , [ 76 ] [ 77 ] dissolved the kingdom and exiled much of the Judean elite to Babylon .

[ 78 ] Classical antiquity Main article: Second Temple period After capturing Babylon in 539 BCE, Cyrus the Great , founder of the Achaemenid Empire , issued a proclamation allowing the exiled Judean population to return.

[ 79 ] [ 80 ] The construction of the Second Temple was completed c.

520 BCE .

[ 79 ] The Achaemenids ruled the region as the province of Yehud Medinata .

[ 81 ] In 332 BCE, Alexander the Great conquered the region as part of his campaign against the Achaemenid Empire . After his death, the area was controlled by the Ptolemaic and Seleucid empires as a part of Coele-Syria . Over the ensuing centuries, the Hellenisation of the region led to cultural tensions that came to a head during the reign of Antiochus IV , giving rise to the Maccabean Revolt of 167 BCE. The civil unrest weakened Seleucid rule, and in the late 2nd century the semi-autonomous Hasmonean Kingdom of Judea arose, eventually attaining full independence and expanding into neighboring regions.

[ 82 ] [ 83 ] [ 84 ] View of the Masada fortress overlooking the Dead Sea , which is the location of a 1st-century Roman siege The Roman Republic invaded the region in 63 BCE, first taking control of Syria , and then intervening in the Hasmonean civil war .

The struggle between pro-Roman and pro- Parthian factions in Judea led to the installation of Herod the Great as a dynastic vassal of Rome . In 6 CE, the area was annexed as the Roman province of Judaea ; tensions with Roman rule led to a series of Jewish–Roman wars , resulting in widespread destruction. The First Jewish–Roman War (66–73 CE) resulted in the destruction of Jerusalem and the Second Temple and a sizable portion of the population being killed or displaced.

[ 85 ] A second uprising known as the Bar Kokhba revolt (132–136 CE) initially allowed the Jews to form an independent state, but the Romans brutally crushed the rebellion, devastating and depopulating Judea's countryside.

[ 85 ] [ 86 ] [ 87 ] [ 88 ] [ 89 ] Jerusalem was rebuilt as a Roman colony ( Aelia Capitolina ), and the province of Judea was renamed Syria Palaestina .

[ 90 ] [ 91 ] Jews were expelled from the districts surrounding Jerusalem.

[ 88 ] [ 92 ] Nevertheless, there was a continuous small Jewish presence, and Galilee became its religious center.

[ 93 ] [ 94 ] Late antiquity and the medieval period Further information: Diocese of the East , Bilad al-Sham , and Kingdom of Jerusalem 3rd-century Kfar Bar'am synagogue in the Galilee [ 95 ] Early Christianity displaced Roman paganism in the 4th century CE, with Constantine embracing and promoting the Christian religion and Theodosius I making it the state religion . A series of laws were passed that discriminated against Jews and Judaism, and Jews were persecuted by both the church and the authorities.

[ 96 ] Many Jews had emigrated to flourishing diaspora communities, [ 97 ] while locally there was both Christian immigration and local conversion. By the middle of the 5th century, there was a Christian majority.

[ 98 ] [ 99 ] Towards the end of the 5th century, Samaritan revolts erupted, continuing until the late 6th century and resulting in a large decrease in the Samaritan population.

[ 100 ] After the Sasanian conquest of Jerusalem and the short-lived Jewish revolt against Heraclius in 614 CE, the Byzantine Empire reconsolidated control of the area in 628.

[ 101 ] In 634–641 CE, the Rashidun Caliphate conquered the Levant .

[ 97 ] [ 102 ] [ 103 ] Caliph Umar ibn al-Khattab ( r.

634–644 ) lifted the Christian ban on Jews entering Jerusalem and permitted them to worship there.

[ 104 ] Over the next six centuries, control of the region transferred between the Umayyad , Abbasid , and Fatimid caliphates, and subsequently the Seljuk and Ayyubid dynasties.

[ 105 ] The population drastically decreased during the following several centuries, dropping from an estimated 1 million during Roman and Byzantine periods to about 300,000 by the early Ottoman period , and there was steady Arabisation and Islamisation .

[ 106 ] [ 75 ] [ 102 ] [ 103 ] [ 107 ] The end of the 11th century brought the Crusades , papally -sanctioned incursions of Christian crusaders intent on wresting Jerusalem and the Holy Land from Muslim control and establishing crusader states .

[ 108 ] The Ayyubids pushed back the crusaders before Muslim rule was fully restored by the Mamluk sultans of Egypt in 1291.

[ 109 ] Modern period and the emergence of Zionism Main articles: Jerusalem Sanjak and Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem Further information: Old Yishuv and Zionism Jews at the Western Wall in the 1870s In 1516, the Ottoman Empire conquered the region and ruled it as part of Ottoman Syria .

[ 110 ] [ 106 ] Two violent incidents took place against Jews, the 1517 Safed attacks and the 1517 Hebron attacks , after the Turkish Ottomans ousted the Mamluks during the Ottoman–Mamluk War .

[ 111 ] [ 112 ] Under the Ottoman Empire, the Levant was fairly cosmopolitan, with religious freedoms for Christians, Muslims, and Jews . In 1561 the Ottoman sultan invited Sephardi Jews escaping the Spanish Inquisition to settle in and rebuild the city of Tiberias .

[ 113 ] [ 114 ] Under the Ottoman Empire's millet system , Christians and Jews were considered dhimmi ("protected") under Ottoman law in exchange for loyalty to the state and payment of the jizya tax.

[ 115 ] [ 116 ] Non-Muslim Ottoman subjects faced geographic and lifestyle restrictions, though these were not always enforced.

[ 117 ] [ 118 ] [ 119 ] The millet system organised non-Muslims into autonomous communities on the basis of religion.

[ 120 ] The First Zionist Congress (1897) in Basel , Switzerland The concept of the "return" remained a symbol within religious Jewish belief which emphasised that their return should be determined by Divine Providence rather than human action.

[ 121 ] Leading Zionist historian Shlomo Avineri describes this connection: "Jews did not relate to the vision of the Return in a more active way than most Christians viewed the Second Coming ." The religious Judaic notion of being a nation was distinct from the modern European notion of nationalism.

[ 122 ] The Jewish population of Palestine from the Ottoman rule to the beginning of the Zionist movement, known as the Old Yishuv , comprised a minority and fluctuated in size. During the 16th century, Jewish communities struck roots in the Four Holy Cities —Jerusalem, Tiberias, Hebron , and Safed —and in 1697, Rabbi Yehuda Hachasid led 1,500 Jews to Jerusalem.

[ 123 ] A 1660 Druze revolt against the Ottomans destroyed Safed and Tiberias .

[ 110 ] In the second half of the 18th century, Eastern European Jews who were opponents of Hasidism , known as the Perushim , settled in Palestine.

[ 124 ] [ 125 ] In the late 18th century, local Arab Sheikh Zahir al-Umar created a de facto independent emirate in the Galilee. Ottoman attempts to subdue the sheikh failed. After Zahir's death the Ottomans regained control of the area. In 1799, governor Jazzar Pasha repelled an assault on Acre by Napoleon 's troops, prompting the French to abandon the Syrian campaign.

[ 126 ] In 1834, a revolt by Palestinian Arab peasants against Egyptian conscription and taxation policies under Muhammad Ali was suppressed; Muhammad Ali's army retreated and Ottoman rule was restored with British support in 1840.

[ 127 ] The Tanzimat reforms were implemented across the Ottoman Empire.

The first wave of modern Jewish migration to Ottoman-ruled Palestine , known as the First Aliyah , began in 1881, as Jews fled pogroms in Eastern Europe.

[ 128 ] The 1882 May Laws increased economic discrimination against Jews, and restricted where they could live.

[ 129 ] [ 130 ] In response, political Zionism took form, a movement that sought to establish a Jewish state in Palestine, thus offering a solution to the Jewish question of the European states.

[ 131 ] [ better source needed ] Antisemitism, pogroms and official policies in tsarist Russia led to the emigration of three million Jews in the years between 1882 and 1914, only 1% of whom went to Palestine. Those who went to Palestine were driven primarily by ideas of self-determination and Jewish identity, rather than as a response to pogroms or economic insecurity.

[ 121 ] The Second Aliyah (1904–1914) began after the Kishinev pogrom ; some 40,000 Jews settled in Palestine, although nearly half left eventually. Both the first and second waves of migrants were mainly Orthodox Jews .

[ 132 ] The Second Aliyah included Zionist socialist groups who established the kibbutz movement based on the idea of establishing a separate Jewish economy based exclusively on Jewish labour.

[ 133 ] [ 134 ] Those of the Second Aliyah who became leaders of the Yishuv in the coming decades believed that the Jewish settler economy should not depend on Arab labour. This would be a dominant source of antagonism with the Arab population, with the new Yishuv's nationalist ideology overpowering its socialist one.

[ 135 ] Though the immigrants of the Second Aliyah largely sought to create communal Jewish agricultural settlements, Tel Aviv was established as the first planned Jewish town in 1909. Jewish armed militias emerged during this period, the first being Bar-Giora in 1907. Two years later, the larger Hashomer organisation was founded as its replacement.

British Mandate for Palestine Main article: Mandatory Palestine Further information: Yishuv , Intercommunal conflict in Mandatory Palestine , and 1948 Palestine war See also: Jewish land purchase in Palestine Chaim Weizmann 's efforts to garner British support for the Zionist movement eventually secured the Balfour Declaration of 1917, [ 136 ] stating Britain's support for the creation of a Jewish " national home " in Palestine.

[ 137 ] [ 138 ] Weizmann's interpretation of the declaration was that negotiations on the future of the country were to happen directly between Britain and the Jews, excluding Arabs.

Jewish-Arab relations in Palestine deteriorated dramatically in the following years.

[ 139 ] In 1918, the Jewish Legion , primarily Zionist volunteers, assisted in the British conquest of Palestine .

[ 140 ] In 1920, the territory was divided between Britain and France under the mandate system , and the British-administered area (including modern Israel) was named Mandatory Palestine .

[ 109 ] [ 141 ] [ 142 ] Arab opposition to British rule and Jewish immigration led to the 1920 Palestine riots and the formation of a Jewish militia known as the Haganah as an outgrowth of Hashomer, from which the Irgun and Lehi paramilitaries later split.

[ 143 ] In 1922, the League of Nations granted Britain the Mandate for Palestine under terms which included the Balfour Declaration with its promise to the Jews and with similar provisions regarding the Arab Palestinians.

[ 144 ] The population of the area was predominantly Arab and Muslim, with Jews accounting for about 11% [ 145 ] and Arab Christians about 9.5% of the population.

[ 146 ] "Jews and Arabs in Grim Struggle for Holy Land", article from 1938 The Third (1919–1923) and Fourth Aliyahs (1924–1929) brought an additional 100,000 Jews to Palestine. The rise of Nazism and the increasing persecution of Jews in 1930s Europe led to the Fifth Aliyah , with an influx of a quarter of a million Jews. This was a major cause of the Arab revolt of 1936–39 , which was suppressed by British security forces and Zionist militias. Several hundred British security personnel and Jews were killed; 5,032 Arabs were killed, 14,760 wounded, and 12,622 detained.

[ 147 ] [ 148 ] [ 149 ] An estimated ten percent of the adult male Palestinian Arab population was killed, wounded, imprisoned, or exiled.

[ 150 ] The British introduced restrictions on Jewish immigration to Palestine with the White Paper of 1939 . With countries around the world turning away Jewish refugees fleeing the Holocaust , a clandestine movement known as Aliyah Bet was organised to bring Jews to Palestine. By the end of World War II , 31% of the population of Palestine was Jewish.

[ 151 ] The UK found itself facing a Jewish insurgency over immigration restrictions and continued conflict with the Arab community over limit levels. The Haganah joined Irgun and Lehi in an armed struggle against British rule.

[ 152 ] The Haganah attempted to bring tens of thousands of Jewish refugees and Holocaust survivors to Palestine by ship. Most of the ships were intercepted by the Royal Navy and the refugees placed in detention camps in Atlit and Cyprus .

[ 153 ] [ 154 ] UN Map , "Palestine plan of partition with economic union" On 22 July 1946, Irgun bombed the British administrative headquarters for Palestine, killing 91.

[ 155 ] [ 156 ] [ 157 ] [ 158 ] The attack was a response to Operation Agatha (a series of raids, including one on the Jewish Agency , by the British) and was the deadliest directed at the British during the Mandate era.

[ 157 ] [ 158 ] The Jewish insurgency continued throughout 1946 and 1947 despite concerted efforts by the British military and Palestine Police Force to suppress it. British efforts to mediate with Jewish and Arab representatives also failed as the Jews were unwilling to accept any solution that did not involve a Jewish state and suggested a partition of Palestine into Jewish and Arab states, while the Arabs were adamant that a Jewish state in any part of Palestine was unacceptable and that the only solution was a unified Palestine under Arab rule. In February 1947, the British referred the Palestine issue to the newly formed United Nations . On 15 May 1947, the UN General Assembly resolved that a Special Committee be created "to prepare ... a report on the question of Palestine".

[ 159 ] The Report of the Committee [ 160 ] proposed a plan to replace the British Mandate with "an independent Arab State, an independent Jewish State, and the City of Jerusalem [...] the last to be under an International Trusteeship System".

[ 161 ] Meanwhile, the Jewish insurgency continued and peaked in July 1947, with a series of widespread guerrilla raids culminating in the Sergeants affair , in which the Irgun took two British sergeants hostage as attempted leverage against the planned execution of three Irgun operatives. After the executions were carried out, the Irgun killed the two British soldiers, hanged their bodies from trees, and left a booby trap at the scene which injured a British soldier. The incident caused widespread outrage in the UK.

[ 162 ] In September 1947, the British cabinet decided to evacuate Palestine as the Mandate was no longer tenable.

[ 163 ] On 29 November 1947, the General Assembly adopted Resolution 181 (II) .

[ 164 ] The plan attached to the resolution was essentially that proposed in the report of 3 September. The Jewish Agency, the recognised representative of the Jewish community, accepted the plan, which assigned 55–56% of Mandatory Palestine to the Jews. At the time, the Jews were about a third of the population and owned around 6–7% of the land. Arabs constituted the majority and owned about 20% of the land, with the remainder held by the Mandate authorities or foreign landowners.

[ 165 ] [ 166 ] [ 167 ] The Arab League and Arab Higher Committee of Palestine rejected it on the basis that the partition plan privileged European interests over those of the Palestinians, [ 168 ] and indicated that they would reject any other plan of partition.

[ 169 ] [ 170 ] On 1 December 1947, the Arab Higher Committee proclaimed a three-day strike, and riots broke out in Jerusalem .

[ 171 ] The situation spiraled into a civil war . Colonial Secretary Arthur Creech Jones announced that the British Mandate would end on 15 May 1948, at which point the British would evacuate. As Arab militias and gangs attacked Jewish areas, they were faced mainly by the Haganah as well as the smaller Irgun and Lehi. In April 1948, the Haganah moved onto the offensive.

[ 172 ] [ 173 ] State of Israel Main article: History of Israel (1948–present) Independence and early years Further information: Israeli Declaration of Independence David Ben-Gurion declaring the establishment of Israel on 14 May 1948 On 14 May 1948, the day before the expiration of the British Mandate, David Ben-Gurion , the head of the Jewish Agency, declared "the establishment of a Jewish state in Eretz-Israel".

[ 174 ] The following day, the armies of four Arab countries—Egypt, Syria, Transjordan, and Iraq—entered what had been Mandatory Palestine, launching the 1948 Arab–Israeli War ; [ 175 ] contingents from Yemen , Morocco , Saudi Arabia , and Sudan joined the war.

[ 176 ] [ 177 ] The purpose of the invasion was to prevent the establishment of the Jewish state.

[ 166 ] [ 178 ] [ 179 ] The Arab League stated the invasion was to restore order and prevent further bloodshed.

[ 180 ] After a year of fighting, a ceasefire was declared and temporary borders, known as the Green Line , were established.

[ 181 ] Jordan annexed what became known as the West Bank , including East Jerusalem , and Egypt occupied the Gaza Strip . Over 700,000 Palestinians fled or were expelled by Zionist militias and the Israeli military —what would become known in Arabic as the nakba ('catastrophe').

[ 182 ] The events also led to the destruction of most of Palestine's Arab culture , identity , and national aspirations . Some 156,000 Arabs remained and became Arab citizens of Israel .

[ 183 ] Raising of the Ink Flag on 10 March 1949, marking the end of the 1948 war By United Nations General Assembly Resolution 273 , Israel was admitted as a member of the UN on 11 May 1949.

[ 184 ] In the early years of the state, the Labour Zionist movement led by Prime Minister Ben-Gurion dominated Israeli politics .

[ 185 ] [ 186 ] Immigration to Israel during the late 1940s and early 1950s was aided by the Israeli Immigration Department and the non-government sponsored Mossad LeAliyah Bet ( lit.

"Institute for Immigration B ").

[ 187 ] The latter engaged in clandestine operations in countries, particularly in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, where the lives of Jews were in danger and exit was difficult. Mossad LeAliyah Bet was disbanded in 1953.

[ 188 ] The immigration was in accordance with the One Million Plan . Some immigrants held Zionist beliefs or came for the promise of a better life, while others moved to escape persecution or were expelled from their homes.

[ 189 ] [ 190 ] An influx of Holocaust survivors and Jews from Arab and Muslim countries to Israel during the first three years increased the number of Jews from 700,000 to 1,400,000. By 1958, the population had risen to two million.

[ 191 ] Between 1948 and 1970, approximately 1,150,000 Jewish refugees relocated to Israel.

[ 192 ] Some immigrants arrived as refugees and were housed in temporary camps known as ma'abarot ; by 1952, over 200,000 people were living in these tent cities.

[ 193 ] Jews of European background were often treated more favourably than Jews from Middle Eastern and North African countries—housing units reserved for the latter were often re-designated for the former, so Jews newly arrived from Arab lands generally ended up staying longer in transit camps.

[ 194 ] [ 195 ] During this period, food, clothes and furniture were rationed in what became known as the austerity period . The need to solve the crisis led Ben-Gurion to sign a reparations agreement with West Germany that triggered mass protests by Jews angered at the idea that Israel could accept monetary compensation for the Holocaust.

[ 196 ] Arab–Israeli conflict Main article: Arab–Israeli conflict During the 1950s, Israel was frequently attacked by Palestinian fedayeen , nearly always against civilians, [ 197 ] mainly from the Egyptian-occupied Gaza Strip, [ 198 ] leading to several Israeli reprisal operations . In 1956, the UK and France aimed at regaining control of the Suez Canal , which Egypt had nationalised. The continued blockade of the Suez Canal and Straits of Tiran to Israeli shipping, together with increasing fedayeen attacks against Israel's southern population and recent Arab threatening statements, prompted Israel to attack Egypt.

[ 199 ] [ 200 ] [ 201 ] Israel joined a secret alliance with the UK and France and overran the Sinai Peninsula in the Suez Crisis but was pressured to withdraw by the UN in return for guarantees of Israeli shipping rights.

[ 202 ] [ 203 ] [ 204 ] The war resulted in significant reduction of Israeli border infiltration.

[ 205 ] U.S. newsreel on the trial of Adolf Eichmann In the early 1960s, Israel captured Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann in Argentina and brought him to Israel for trial .

[ 206 ] Eichmann remains the only person executed in Israel by conviction in an Israeli civilian court.

[ 207 ] In 1963, Israel was engaged in a diplomatic standoff with the United States in relation to the Israeli nuclear programme .

[ 208 ] [ 209 ] Since 1964 Arab countries, concerned over Israeli plans to divert waters of the Jordan River into the coastal plain , [ 210 ] had been trying to divert the headwaters to deprive Israel of water resources, provoking tensions between Israel on the one hand, and Syria and Lebanon on the other.

Arab nationalists led by Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser refused to recognise Israel and called for its destruction.

[ 211 ] [ 212 ] [ 213 ] By 1966 Israeli-Arab relations had deteriorated to the point of battles taking place between Israeli and Arab forces.

[ 214 ] Territory held by Israel: before the Six-Day War after the war The Sinai Peninsula was returned to Egypt in 1982.

In May 1967, Egypt massed its army near the border with Israel, expelled UN peacekeepers stationed in the Sinai Peninsula since 1957, and blocked Israel's access to the Red Sea.

[ 215 ] [ 216 ] [ 217 ] Other Arab states mobilised their forces.

[ 218 ] Israel reiterated that these actions were a casus belli and launched a pre-emptive strike ( Operation Focus ) against Egypt in June. Jordan, Syria and Iraq attacked Israel. In the Six-Day War , Israel captured and occupied the West Bank from Jordan, the Gaza Strip and Sinai Peninsula from Egypt, and the Golan Heights from Syria.

[ 219 ] Jerusalem's boundaries were enlarged, incorporating East Jerusalem. The 1949 Green Line became the administrative boundary between Israel and the occupied territories .

[ 220 ] Following the 1967 war and the " Three Nos " resolution of the Arab League, Israel faced attacks from the Egyptians in the Sinai Peninsula during the 1967–1970 War of Attrition , and from Palestinian groups targeting Israelis in the occupied territories, globally, and in Israel. Most important among the Palestinian and Arab groups was the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), established in 1964, which initially committed itself to "armed struggle as the only way to liberate the homeland".

[ 221 ] In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Palestinian groups launched attacks [ 222 ] [ 223 ] against Israeli and Jewish targets around the world, [ 224 ] including a massacre of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich. The Israeli government responded with an assassination campaign against the organisers of the massacre, a bombing and a raid on the PLO headquarters in Lebanon .

On 6 October 1973, the Egyptian and Syrian armies launched a surprise attack against Israeli forces in the Sinai Peninsula and Golan Heights, opening the Yom Kippur War . The war ended on 25 October with Israel repelling Egyptian and Syrian forces but suffering great losses.

[ 225 ] An internal inquiry exonerated the government of responsibility for failures before and during the war, but public anger forced Prime Minister Golda Meir to resign.

[ 226 ] [ better source needed ] In July 1976, an airliner was hijacked in flight from Israel to France by Palestinian guerrillas; Israeli commandos rescued 102 of 106 Israeli hostages .

Peace process Main article: Israeli–Palestinian peace process The 1977 Knesset elections marked a major turning point in Israeli political history as Menachem Begin 's Likud party took control from the Labour Party .

[ 227 ] Later that year, Egyptian President Anwar El Sadat made a trip to Israel and spoke before the Knesset in what was the first recognition of Israel by an Arab head of state.

[ 228 ] Sadat and Begin signed the Camp David Accords (1978) and the Egypt–Israel peace treaty (1979).

[ 229 ] In return, Israel withdrew from the Sinai Peninsula and agreed to enter negotiations over autonomy for Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.

[ 229 ] On 11 March 1978, a PLO guerilla raid from Lebanon led to the Coastal Road massacre . Israel responded by launching an invasion of southern Lebanon to destroy PLO bases. Begin's government meanwhile provided incentives for Israelis to settle in the occupied West Bank , increasing friction with the Palestinians there.

[ 230 ] The 1980 Jerusalem Law was believed by some to reaffirm Israel's 1967 annexation of Jerusalem by government decree and reignited international controversy over the status of the city . No Israeli legislation has defined the territory of Israel, and no act specifically included East Jerusalem therein.

[ 231 ] In 1981 Israel effectively annexed the Golan Heights.

[ 232 ] The international community largely rejected these moves, with the UN Security Council declaring both the Jerusalem Law and the Golan Heights Law null and void.

[ 233 ] [ 234 ] Several waves of Ethiopian Jews immigrated to Israel since the 1980s, while between 1990 and 1994, immigration from the post-Soviet states increased Israel's population by twelve percent.

[ 235 ] On 7 June 1981, during the Iran–Iraq War , the Israeli air force destroyed Iraq's sole nuclear reactor, then under construction, in order to impede the Iraqi nuclear weapons programme.

[ 236 ] Following a series of PLO attacks in 1982, Israel invaded Lebanon to destroy the PLO bases.

[ 237 ] In the first six days, Israel destroyed the military forces of the PLO in Lebanon and decisively defeated the Syrians. An Israeli government inquiry (the Kahan Commission ) held Begin and several Israeli generals indirectly responsible for the Sabra and Shatila massacre and held defence minister Ariel Sharon as bearing "personal responsibility".

[ 238 ] Sharon was forced to resign.

[ 239 ] In 1985, Israel responded to a Palestinian terrorist attack in Cyprus by bombing the PLO headquarters in Tunisia. Israel withdrew from most of Lebanon in 1986 but continued to occupy a borderland buffer zone in southern Lebanon until 2000, from where Israeli forces engaged in conflict with Hezbollah . The First Intifada , a Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule, [ 240 ] broke out in 1987, with waves of uncoordinated demonstrations and violence in the occupied West Bank and Gaza. Over the following six years, the intifada became more organised and included economic and cultural measures aimed at disrupting the Israeli occupation. Over 1,000 people were killed.

[ 241 ] During the 1991 Gulf War , the PLO supported Saddam Hussein and Iraqi missile attacks against Israel . Despite public outrage, Israel heeded American calls to refrain from hitting back.

[ 242 ] [ 243 ] Shimon Peres (left) with Yitzhak Rabin (center) and King Hussein of Jordan (right), prior to signing the Israel–Jordan peace treaty in 1994 In 1992, Yitzhak Rabin became prime minister following an election in which his party called for compromise with Israel's neighbours.

[ 244 ] [ 245 ] The following year, Shimon Peres on behalf of Israel and Yasser Arafat for the PLO signed the Oslo Accords , which gave the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) the right to govern parts of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.

[ 246 ] The PLO also recognised Israel's right to exist and pledged an end to terrorism.

[ 247 ] In 1994, the Israel–Jordan peace treaty was signed, making Jordan the second Arab country to normalise relations with Israel.

[ 248 ] Arab public support for the Accords was damaged by the continuation of Israeli settlements [ 249 ] and checkpoints , and the deterioration of economic conditions.

[ 250 ] Israeli public support for the Accords waned after Palestinian suicide attacks .

[ 251 ] In November 1995, Rabin was assassinated by Yigal Amir , a far-right Jew who opposed the Accords.

[ 252 ] During Benjamin Netanyahu 's premiership at the end of the 1990s, Israel agreed to withdraw from Hebron , [ 253 ] though this was never ratified or implemented, [ 254 ] and he signed the Wye River Memorandum . The agreement dealt with further redeployments in the West Bank and security issues. The memorandum was criticised by major international human rights organisations for its "encouragement" of human rights abuses.

[ 255 ] [ 256 ] Ehud Barak , elected prime minister in 1999, withdrew forces from southern Lebanon and conducted negotiations with PNA Chairman Yasser Arafat and U.S. President Bill Clinton at the 2000 Camp David Summit . Barak offered a plan for the establishment of a Palestinian state , including the entirety of the Gaza Strip and over 90% of the West Bank with Jerusalem as a shared capital.

[ 257 ] Each side blamed the other for the failure of the talks.

21st century In late 2000, after a controversial visit by Sharon to the Temple Mount , the Second Intifada began. The popular uprising faced disproportionate repression from the Israeli state.

[ 258 ] Palestinian suicide bombings eventually developed into a recurrent feature of the intifada.

[ 259 ] Some commentators contend that the intifada was pre-planned by Arafat after the collapse of peace talks.

[ 260 ] [ 261 ] [ 262 ] [ 263 ] Sharon became prime minister in a 2001 election ; he carried out his plan to unilaterally withdraw from the Gaza Strip and spearheaded the construction of the West Bank barrier , [ 264 ] ending the intifada.

[ 265 ] Between 2000 and 2008, 1,063 Israelis, 5,517 Palestinians and 64 foreign citizens were killed.

[ 266 ] In July 2006, a Hezbollah artillery assault on Israel's northern border communities and a cross-border abduction of two Israeli soldiers precipitated the month-long Second Lebanon War , including an Israeli invasion of Lebanon.

[ 267 ] [ 268 ] The war wound down in August 2006 after the passage of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701 ; Israeli forces mostly withdrew from Lebanon by October 2006 but continued to occupy the Lebanese portion of Ghajar village.

[ 269 ] [ 270 ] In 2007 the Israeli Air Force destroyed a nuclear reactor in Syria. In 2008, a ceasefire between Hamas and Israel collapsed, resulting in the three-week Gaza War .

[ 271 ] [ 272 ] In what Israel described as a response to over a hundred Palestinian rocket attacks on southern Israeli cities, [ 273 ] Israel began an operation in the Gaza Strip in 2012, lasting eight days.

[ 274 ] Israel started another operation in Gaza following an escalation of rocket attacks by Hamas in July 2014.

[ 275 ] In May 2021 another round of fighting took place in Gaza and Israel, lasting eleven days.

[ 276 ] U.S. President Joe Biden with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Isaac Herzog in Tel Aviv on 18 October 2023 By the 2010s, increasing regional cooperation between Israel and Arab League countries have been established, culminating in the signing of the Abraham Accords . The Israeli security situation shifted from the traditional Arab–Israeli conflict towards the Iran–Israel proxy conflict and direct confrontation with Iran during the Syrian civil war . On 7 October 2023, Palestinian militant groups from Gaza, led by Hamas, launched a series of coordinated attacks on Israel, leading to the start of the Gaza war .

[ 277 ] On that day, approximately 1,300 Israelis, predominantly civilians, were killed in communities near the Gaza Strip border and during a music festival .

Over 200 hostages were kidnapped and taken to the Gaza Strip.

[ 278 ] [ 279 ] [ 280 ] After clearing militants from its territory, Israel launched one of the most destructive bombing campaigns in modern history [ 281 ] [ 282 ] and invaded Gaza on 27 October with the stated objectives of destroying Hamas and freeing hostages.

[ 283 ] [ 284 ] The fifth war of the Gaza–Israel conflict since 2008, it has been the deadliest for Palestinians in the entire Israeli–Palestinian conflict [ 285 ] and the most significant military engagement in the region since the Yom Kippur War in 1973.

[ 286 ] In April 2024, Israel initiated a wave of airstrikes to Iran, after Iranian strikes targeted Israel. In October 2024, Israel invaded Lebanon [ 287 ] and exchanged missile barrages with Iran three weeks later, in response of Iranian strikes earlier in that month.

[ 288 ] After nearly a year of the Israel–Hezbollah conflict from October 2023 due to Hezbollah shooting rockets at Israel to support Hamas in Gaza, Israel assassinated Hezbollah secretary general Hassan Nasrallah in September 2024.

[ 289 ] A November 2024 ceasefire agreement instructed Israel to withdraw from Lebanon, which Israel mostly did by February 2025, but against the agreement Israeli forces stayed in five military outposts on highlands in Southern Lebanon.

[ 290 ] [ 291 ] In June 2025, Israel launched a renewed series of missile strikes on Iran, which escalated into a armed conflict .

[ 292 ] A United Nations Special Committee , multiple governments , and various experts and human rights organisations have concluded that Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinian people due to the harm and loss of life inflicted on civilians during the Gaza War .

[ 293 ] [ 294 ] [ 295 ] Geography Main article: Geography of Israel See also: Agriculture in Israel , Wildlife of Israel , List of forests in Israel , and Yatir Forest Geography of Israel v t e Galilee Coastal plain Judaean Mountains Jordan Valley Negev Levantine Sea ( Mediterranean ) Kinneret Dead Sea Gulf of Eilat West Bank Gaza Strip Lebanon Syria Jordan Egypt Satellite images of Israel and neighbouring territories during the day and night Israel is located in the Levant area of the Fertile Crescent . At the eastern end of the Mediterranean Sea , it is bounded by Lebanon to the north, Syria to the north-east, Jordan and the West Bank to the east, and Egypt and the Gaza Strip to the south-west. It lies between latitudes 29° and 34° N , and longitudes 34° and 36° E .

The sovereign territory of Israel (according to the demarcation lines of the 1949 Armistice Agreements and excluding all territories captured by Israel during the 1967 Six-Day War) is approximately 20,770 square kilometers (8,019 sq mi), of which two percent is water.

[ 296 ] However Israel is so narrow (100 km at its widest, compared to 400 km from north to south) that the exclusive economic zone in the Mediterranean is double the land area of the country.

[ 297 ] The total area under Israeli law, including East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, is 22,072 square kilometers (8,522 sq mi), [ 298 ] and the total area under Israeli control, including the military-controlled and partially Palestinian-governed territory of the West Bank, is 27,799 square kilometers (10,733 sq mi).

[ 299 ] Despite its small size, Israel is home to a variety of geographic features, from the Negev desert in the south to the inland fertile Jezreel Valley , with mountain ranges of the Galilee , Carmel and towards the Golan in the north. The Israeli coastal plain on the shores of the Mediterranean is home to most of the population.

[ 300 ] East of the central highlands lies the Jordan Rift Valley , a small part of the 6,500-kilometer (4,039 mi) Great Rift Valley . The Jordan River runs along the Jordan Rift Valley, from Mount Hermon through the Hulah Valley and the Sea of Galilee to the Dead Sea , the lowest point on the surface of the Earth.

[ 301 ] Further south is the Arabah , ending with the Gulf of Eilat , part of the Red Sea .

Makhtesh , or "erosion cirques" are unique to the Negev and the Sinai Peninsula , the largest being the Makhtesh Ramon at 38 km in length.

[ 302 ] Israel has the largest number of plant species per square meter of the countries in the Mediterranean Basin [ 303 ] and contains four terrestrial ecoregions: Eastern Mediterranean conifer–sclerophyllous–broadleaf forests , Southern Anatolian montane conifer and deciduous forests , Arabian Desert , and Mesopotamian shrub desert .

[ 304 ] Forests accounted for 8.5% of the area in 2016, up from 2% in 1948, as the result of a large-scale forest planting programme by the Jewish National Fund .

[ 305 ] [ 306 ] Tectonics and seismicity Further information: List of earthquakes in the Levant The Jordan Rift Valley is the result of tectonic movements within the Dead Sea Transform (DST) fault system. The DST forms the transform boundary between the African Plate to the west and the Arabian Plate to the east. The Golan Heights and all of Jordan are part of the Arabian Plate, while the Galilee, West Bank, Coastal Plain, and Negev along with the Sinai Peninsula are on the African Plate. This tectonic disposition leads to a relatively high seismic activity. The entire Jordan Valley segment is thought to have ruptured repeatedly, for instance during the last two major earthquakes along this structure in 749 and 1033 . The deficit in slip that has built up since 1033 is sufficient to cause an earthquake of M w ~7.4.

[ 307 ] The most catastrophic known earthquakes occurred in 31 BCE, 363 , 749, and 1033 CE, that is every ca.

400 years on average.

[ 308 ] Destructive earthquakes strike about every 80 years, leading to serious loss of life .

[ 309 ] While stringent construction regulations are in place and recently built structures are earthquake resistant, as of 2007 [update] many public buildings as well as 50,000 residential buildings did not meet the new standards and were "expected to collapse" if exposed to a strong earthquake.

[ 309 ] Climate Further information: Climate change in Israel The projections of the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report show clearly the impacts of climate change on Israel even at 2 degrees of warming.

Temperatures vary widely, especially during the winter. Coastal areas, such as those of Tel Aviv and Haifa, have a typical Mediterranean climate with cool, rainy winters and long, hot summers. The area of Beersheba and the northern Negev have a semi-arid climate with hot summers, cool winters, and fewer rainy days. The southern Negev and the Arabah areas have a desert climate with very hot, dry summers, and mild winters with few days of rain. The highest temperature of 54 °C (129 °F) was recorded in 1942 in the Tirat Zvi kibbutz.

[ 310 ] [ 311 ] Mountainous regions can be windy and cold, and areas at elevation of 750 metres (2,460 ft) or more (same elevation as Jerusalem) usually receive at least one snowfall each year.

[ 312 ] From May to September, rain is rare.

[ 313 ] [ 314 ] There are four different phytogeographic regions, due to its location between the temperate and tropical zones. For this reason, the flora and fauna are extremely diverse. There are 2,867 known species of plants in Israel . Of these, at least 253 species are introduced and non-native .

[ 315 ] There are 380 Israeli nature reserves .

[ 316 ] With scarce water resources, Israel has developed various water-saving technologies, including drip irrigation .

[ 317 ] [ 318 ] The considerable sunlight available for solar energy makes Israel the leading nation in solar energy use per capita—practically every house uses solar panels for water heating.

[ 319 ] The Ministry of Environmental Protection has reported that climate change "will have a decisive impact on all areas of life", particularly for vulnerable populations.

[ 320 ] Government and politics Main articles: Israeli system of government and Politics of Israel President Isaac Herzog Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu The Knesset chamber, home to the Israeli parliament Israel has a parliamentary system , proportional representation and universal suffrage . A member of parliament supported by a parliamentary majority becomes the prime minister —usually this is the chair of the largest party. The prime minister is the head of government and of cabinet .

[ 321 ] [ 322 ] The president is head of state , with largely ceremonial duties.

[ 321 ] Israel is governed by a 120-member parliament, known as the Knesset . Membership of the Knesset is based on proportional representation of political parties , [ 323 ] [ 324 ] with a 3.25% electoral threshold, which in practice has resulted in coalition governments. Residents of Israeli settlements in the West Bank are eligible to vote, [ 325 ] and after the 2015 election , 10 of the 120 members of the Knesset ( 8%) were settlers.

[ 326 ] Parliamentary elections are scheduled every four years, but unstable coalitions or a no-confidence vote can dissolve a government earlier.

[ 33 ] The first Arab-led party was established in 1988, [ 327 ] and as of 2022, Arab-led parties hold about 10% of seats.

[ 328 ] A party cannot run for election to the Knesset if its objectives or actions include the "negation of the existence of the State of Israel as the state of the Jewish people".

The Basic Laws of Israel function as an uncodified constitution . These define Israel as a Jewish and democratic state and the nation-state of exclusively the Jewish people.

[ 329 ] In 2003, the Knesset began to draft an official constitution based on these laws.

[ 296 ] [ 330 ] Israel has no official religion, [ 331 ] [ 332 ] [ 333 ] but the definition of the state as "Jewish and democratic" creates a strong connection with Judaism . On 19 July 2018, the Knesset passed a Basic Law that characterizes Israel as principally a " Nation State of the Jewish People " and Hebrew as its official language. The bill ascribes an undefined "special status" to the Arabic language.

[ 334 ] The same bill gives Jews a unique right to national self-determination and views the developing of Jewish settlement in the country as "a national interest", empowering the government to "take steps to encourage, advance and implement this interest".

[ 335 ] Administrative divisions Main article: Districts of Israel Districts of Israel Central Haifa Jerusalem Northern Southern Tel Aviv Judea and Samaria Area v t e The State of Israel is divided into six main administrative districts, known as mehozot (Hebrew: מחוזות ; sg.

: mahoz )— Center , Haifa , Jerusalem , North , South , and Tel Aviv , as well as the Judea and Samaria Area in the West Bank. All of the Judea and Samaria Area and parts of the Jerusalem and Northern districts are not recognised internationally as part of Israel. Districts are divided into 15 sub-districts known as nafot (Hebrew: נפות ; sg.

: nafa ), which are partitioned into 50 natural regions.

Israeli citizenship law Main article: Israeli citizenship law The 1950 Law of Return grants Jews the unrestricted right to immigrate to Israel and obtain Israeli citizenship. Individuals born within the country receive birthright citizenship if at least one parent is a citizen.

[ 339 ] Israeli law defines Jewish nationality as distinct from Israeli nationality, and the Supreme Court of Israel has ruled that an Israeli nationality does not exist.

[ 340 ] [ 341 ] A Jewish national is defined as any person practicing Judaism and their descendants.

Israel also captured the Sinai Peninsula but returned it to Egypt as part of the 1979 Egypt–Israel peace treaty.

[ 229 ] Between 1982 and 2000, Israel occupied part of southern Lebanon , in what was known as the Security Belt . Since capture of these territories, Israeli settlements and military installations have been built within each of them, except Lebanon.

The Golan Heights and East Jerusalem have been fully incorporated under Israeli law but not under international law. Israel has applied civilian law to both areas and granted their inhabitants permanent residency status and the ability to apply for citizenship. The UN Security Council has declared the annexation of the Golan Heights and East Jerusalem to be "null and void" and continues to view the territories as occupied.

[ 342 ] [ 343 ] The status of East Jerusalem in any future peace settlement has at times been a difficult issue in negotiations between Israeli governments and representatives of the Palestinians.

Israeli West Bank barrier is a separation barrier built by Israel along the Green Line and inside parts of the West Bank.

The West Bank excluding East Jerusalem is known as the Judea and Samaria Area. The almost 400,000 Israeli settlers residing in the area are considered part of Israel's population, have Knesset representation, are subject to a large part of Israel's civil and criminal laws , and their output is considered part of Israel's economy.

[ 344 ] [ fn 4 ] The land is not considered part of Israel under Israeli law, as Israel has consciously refrained from annexing the territory, without ever relinquishing its legal claim to the land or defining a border.

[ 344 ] Israeli political opposition to annexation primarily stems from the perceived "demographic threat" of incorporating the West Bank's Palestinian population into Israel.

[ 344 ] Outside of the Israeli settlements, the West Bank remains under direct Israeli military rule, and Palestinians in the area cannot become Israeli citizens.

The international community maintains that Israel does not have sovereignty in the West Bank and considers Israel's control of the area to be the longest military occupation in modern history.

[ 347 ] The West Bank was occupied and annexed by Jordan in 1950, following the 1949 Armistice Agreements. Only Britain recognised this annexation, and Jordan has since ceded its claim to the territory to the PLO. The population is mainly Palestinians, including refugees of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War.

[ 348 ] From their occupation in 1967 until 1993, the Palestinians living in these territories were under Israeli military administration . Since the Israel–PLO letters of recognition , most of the Palestinian population and cities have been under the internal jurisdiction of the Palestinian Authority, and only partial Israeli military control, although Israel has redeployed its troops and reinstated full military administration during periods of unrest. Israel's claim of universal suffrage has been questioned due to its blurred territorial boundaries, its simultaneous extension of voting rights to Israeli settlers in the occupied territories and denial of voting rights to their Palestinian neighbours, as well as the alleged ethnocratic nature of the state.

[ 349 ] [ 350 ] The Gaza Strip is considered to be a "foreign territory" under Israeli law. Israel and Egypt operate a land, air, and sea blockade of the Gaza Strip . The Gaza Strip was occupied by Israel after 1967. In 2005, as part of a unilateral disengagement plan , Israel removed its settlers and forces from the territory but continues to maintain control of its airspace and waters. The international community, including numerous international humanitarian organisations and UN bodies, consider Gaza to remain occupied.

[ 351 ] [ 352 ] [ 353 ] [ 354 ] [ 355 ] Following the 2007 Battle of Gaza, when Hamas assumed power in the Gaza Strip , [ 356 ] Israel tightened control of the Gaza crossings along its border , as well as by sea and air, and prevented persons from entering and exiting except for isolated cases it deemed humanitarian.

[ 356 ] Gaza has a border with Egypt , and an agreement between Israel, the EU, and the PA governs how border crossings take place.

[ 357 ] The application of democracy to its Palestinian citizens and the selective application of Israeli democracy in the Israeli-controlled Palestinian territories have been criticised.

[ 358 ] [ 359 ] International opinion See also: Israeli war crimes The International Court of Justice said, in its 2004 advisory opinion on the legality of the construction of the West Bank barrier, that the lands captured by Israel in the Six-Day War, including East Jerusalem, are occupied territory and found that the construction of the wall within the occupied Palestinian territory violates international law.

[ 360 ] Most negotiations relating to the territories have been on the basis of UN Security Council Resolution 242 , which emphasises "the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war", and calls on Israel to withdraw from occupied territories in return for normalisation of relations with Arab states (" Land for peace ").

[ 361 ] [ 362 ] [ 363 ] Israel has been criticised for engaging in systematic and widespread violations of human rights in the occupied territories , including occupation [ 364 ] and war crimes against civilians.

[ 365 ] [ 366 ] [ 367 ] [ 368 ] The allegations include violations of international humanitarian law [ 369 ] by the UN Human Rights Council .

[ 370 ] The U.S. State Department has called reports of abuses of significant human rights of Palestinians "credible" both within Israel [ 371 ] and the occupied territories.

[ 372 ] Amnesty International and other NGOs have documented mass arbitrary arrests, torture, unlawful killings, systemic abuses and impunity [ 373 ] [ 374 ] [ 375 ] [ 376 ] in tandem with a denial of the right to Palestinian self-determination .

[ 377 ] [ 378 ] [ 379 ] [ 380 ] [ 381 ] Prime Minister Netanyahu has defended the country's security forces for protecting the innocent from terrorists [ 382 ] and expressed contempt for what he describes as a lack of concern about the human rights violations committed by "criminal killers".

[ 383 ] The international community widely regards Israeli settlements in the occupied territories illegal under international law .

[ 384 ] United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334 (passed 2016) states that Israel's settlement activity constitutes a "flagrant violation" of international law and demands that Israel stop such activity and fulfill its obligations as an occupying power under the Fourth Geneva Convention .

[ 385 ] A United Nations special rapporteur concluded that the settlement programme was a war crime under the Rome Statute , [ 386 ] and Amnesty International found that the settlement programme constitutes an illegal transfer of civilians into occupied territory and "pillage", which is prohibited by the Hague Conventions and Geneva Conventions as well as being a war crime under the Rome Statute.

[ 387 ] In a 2024 advisory opinion , the International Court of Justice stated that occupation of the Palestinian territories violated international law; Israel should end its occupation as quickly as possible and pay reparations. In addition, the court found that Israel was in breach of article 3 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination , which requires states to prevent, prohibit and eradicate all practices of racial segregation and apartheid.

[ 388 ] [ 389 ] [ 390 ] Accusations of apartheid Main article: Israeli apartheid Treatment of Palestinians within the occupied territories and to a lesser extent in Israel itself have drawn widespread accusations that it is guilty of apartheid , a crime against humanity under the Rome Statute and the International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid .

[ 391 ] [ 392 ] The Washington Post' s 2021 survey of scholars and academic experts on the Middle East found an increase from 59% to 65% of these scholars describing Israel as a "one-state reality akin to apartheid".

[ 393 ] [ 394 ] The claim that Israel's policies for Palestinians within Israel or within Israeli-occupied territories amount to apartheid has been affirmed by Israeli human rights organisation B'tselem , [ 395 ] [ 396 ] University Network for Human Rights, [ 397 ] and international human rights organisations such as Amnesty International [ 398 ] and Human Rights Watch .

[ 392 ] [ 399 ] Israeli human rights organisation Yesh Din has also accused Israel of apartheid.

[ 399 ] Amnesty's claim was criticised by politicians and representatives from Israel and its closest allies such as, the US, [ 400 ] the UK, [ 401 ] the European Commission , [ 402 ] Australia, [ 403 ] Netherlands [ 404 ] and Germany, [ 405 ] while said accusations were welcomed by Palestinians [ 406 ] and the Arab League .

[ 407 ] In 2022, Michael Lynk, a Canadian law professor appointed by the U.N. Human Rights Council said that the situation met the legal definition of apartheid, and concluded: "Israel has imposed upon Palestine an apartheid reality in a post-apartheid world".

[ 408 ] [ 409 ] Subsequent reports from his successor, Francesca Albanese and from Permanent United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Israel Palestine conflict chair Navi Pillay echoed the opinion.

[ 410 ] [ 411 ] In February 2024, the ICJ held public hearings in regards to the legal consequences arising from the policies and practices of Israel in the occupied Palestinian territory including East Jerusalem. During the hearings, 24 states and three international organisations said that Israeli practices amount to a breach of the prohibition of apartheid and/or amount to prohibited acts of racial discrimination.

[ 412 ] The International Court of Justice in its 2024 advisory opinion found that Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories constitutes systemic discrimination and is in breach of Article 3 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination , which prohibits racial segregation and apartheid. The opinion is silent as to whether the discrimination amounts to apartheid; individual judges were split on the question.

It has 107 diplomatic missions ; [ 419 ] countries with which it has no diplomatic relations include most Muslim countries.

[ 420 ] Six out of 22 nations in the Arab League have normalised relations with Israel. Israel remains formally in a state of war with Syria , dating back uninterrupted to 1948. It has been in a similarly formal state of war with Lebanon since the end of the Lebanese Civil War in 2000, with the Israel–Lebanon border remaining unagreed by treaty.

Despite the peace treaty between Israel and Egypt, Israel is still widely considered an enemy country among Egyptians.

[ 421 ] Iran withdrew its recognition of Israel during the Islamic Revolution .

[ 422 ] Israeli citizens may not visit Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen without permission from the Ministry of the Interior .

[ 423 ] As a result of the 2008–09 Gaza War, Mauritania, Qatar, Bolivia, and Venezuela suspended political and economic ties with Israel, [ 424 ] though Bolivia renewed ties in 2019.

[ 425 ] Yitzhak Rabin and Yasser Arafat at the signing ceremony of the Oslo Accords with then US President Bill Clinton The United States and the Soviet Union were the first two countries to recognise the State of Israel, having declared recognition roughly simultaneously.

[ 426 ] Diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union were broken in 1967 following the Six-Day War and renewed in 1991.

[ 427 ] The United States regards Israel as its "most reliable partner in the Middle East", [ 428 ] based on "common democratic values, religious affinities, and security interests".

[ 429 ] The US has provided $68 billion in military assistance and $32 billion in grants to Israel since 1967, under the Foreign Assistance Act (period beginning 1962), [ 430 ] more than any other country for that period until 2003.

[ 430 ] [ 431 ] [ 432 ] Most surveyed Americans have held consistently favourable views of Israel.

[ 433 ] [ 434 ] The United Kingdom is seen as having a "natural" relationship with Israel because of the Mandate for Palestine.

[ 435 ] By 2007 [update] , Germany had paid 25 billion euros in reparations to Israel and individual Israeli Holocaust survivors.

[ 436 ] Israel is included in the European Union's European Neighbourhood Policy .

[ 437 ] Although Turkey and Israel did not establish full diplomatic relations until 1991, [ 438 ] Turkey has cooperated with the Jewish state since its recognition of Israel in 1949. Turkey's ties to other Muslim-majority nations in the region have at times resulted in pressure from Arab and Muslim states to temper its relationship with Israel.

[ 439 ] Relations took a downturn after the 2008–09 Gaza War and Israel's raid of the Gaza flotilla .

[ 440 ] Relations between Greece and Israel have improved since 1995 after decline of Israeli–Turkish relations.

[ 441 ] The two countries have a defence cooperation agreement and in 2010, the Israeli Air Force hosted Greece's Hellenic Air Force in a joint exercise. The joint Cyprus-Israel oil and gas explorations centered on the Leviathan gas field are an important factor for Greece, given its strong links with Cyprus.

[ 442 ] Cooperation in the world's longest submarine power cable , the EuroAsia Interconnector , has strengthened Cyprus–Israel relations .

[ 443 ] Azerbaijan is one of the few majority Muslim countries to develop strategic and economic relations with Israel .

[ 444 ] Kazakhstan also has an economic and strategic partnership with Israel.

[ 445 ] India established full diplomatic ties with Israel in 1992 and has fostered a strong military, technological and cultural partnership with the country since then.

[ 446 ] India is the largest customer of the Israeli military equipment , and Israel is the second-largest military partner of India after Russia.

[ 447 ] Ethiopia is Israel's main ally in Africa due to common political, religious and security interests.

[ 448 ] Foreign aid Israel has a history of providing emergency foreign aid and humanitarian response to disasters across the world.

[ 449 ] In 1955 Israel began its foreign aid programme in Burma and then shifted to Africa.

[ 450 ] Israel's humanitarian efforts officially began in 1957 with the establishment of Mashav , the Israel's Agency for International Development Cooperation.

[ 451 ] In this early period, whilst Israel's aid represented only a small percentage of total aid to Africa, its programme was effective in creating goodwill; however, following the 1967 war relations soured.

[ 452 ] Israel's foreign aid programme subsequently shifted its focus to Latin America.

[ 450 ] Since the late 1970s Israel's foreign aid has gradually decreased, although in recent years Israel has tried to reestablish aid to Africa.

[ 453 ] There are additional Israeli humanitarian and emergency response groups that work with the government, including IsraAid , a joint programme run by Israeli organisations and North American Jewish groups, [ 454 ] ZAKA , [ 455 ] The Fast Israeli Rescue and Search Team, [ 456 ] Israeli Flying Aid, [ 457 ] Save a Child's Heart [ 458 ] and Latet .

[ 459 ] Between 1985 and 2015, Israel sent 24 delegations of their search and rescue unit the Home Front Command to 22 countries.

[ 460 ] Currently Israeli foreign aid ranks low among OECD nations, spending less than 0.1% of its GNI on development assistance.

[ 461 ] The country ranked 38th in the 2018 World Giving Index .

Arab citizens of Israel (except the Druze ) and those engaged in full-time religious studies are exempt , although the exemption of yeshiva students has been a source of contention.

[ 467 ] [ 468 ] An alternative for those who receive exemptions on various grounds is Sherut Leumi , or national service, which involves a programme of service in social welfare frameworks.

[ 469 ] A small minority of Israeli Arabs also volunteer in the army.

[ 470 ] As a result of its conscription programme, the IDF maintains approximately 176,500 active troops and 465,000 reservists, giving Israel one of the world's highest percentage of citizens with military training .

[ 471 ] Iron Dome is the world's first operational anti- artillery rocket defence system.

[ 550 ] The natural gas reserves in these two fields could make Israel energy-secure for more than 50 years. Commercial production of natural gas from the Tamar field began in 2013, with over 7.5 billion cubic meters (bcm) produced annually.

[ 551 ] Israel had 199 billion bcm of proven reserves of natural gas as of 2016.

[ 552 ] The Leviathan gas field started production in 2019.

[ 553 ] Ketura Sun is Israel's first commercial solar field. Built in 2011 by the Arava Power Company , the field will produce about 9 gigawatt-hours of electricity per year, [ 554 ] sparing the production of some 125,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide over 20 years.

[ 608 ] These sentiments were reflected in the early policies of the Israeli government, which largely banned Yiddish theatre and publications.

[ 609 ] Until 2018, Arabic was also an official language; [ 11 ] in 2018 it was downgraded to having a "special status in the state".

To a large extent it is this approach that still guides the diplomatic behaviour of states and thus has greater force in international law." ^ Morris, Benny (1999).

The mass immigration from Arab countries began in mid-1949 and included three communities that relocated to Israel almost in their entirety: 31,000 Jews from Libya, 50,000 from Yemen, and 125,000 from Iraq. Additional immigrants arrived from Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia, Turkey, Iran, India, and elsewhere. Within three years, the Jewish population of Israel doubled. The ethnic composition of the population shifted as well, as immigrants from Muslim counties and their offspring now comprised one third of the Jewish population—an unprecedented phenomenon in global immigration history. From 1952–60, Israel regulated and restricted immigration from Muslim countries with a selective immigration policy based on economic criteria, and sent these immigrants, most of whom were North African, to peripheral Israeli settlements. The selective immigration policy ended in 1961 when, following an agreement between Israel and Morocco, about 100,000 Jews immigrated to the State. From 1952–68 about 600,000 Jews arrived in Israel, three quarters of whom were from Arab countries and the remaining immigrants were largely from Eastern Europe. Today fewer than 30,000 remain in Muslim countries, mostly concentrated in Iran and Turkey.

Not only was there no Palestinian Arab state, but the vast majority of the Arab population in the territory that became Israel-over 700,000 people-had become refugees. The Arab flight from Palestine began during the intercommunal war and was at first the normal reaction of a civilian population to nearby fighting-a temporary evacuation from the zone of combat with plans to return once hostilities ceased. However, during spring and early summer 1948, the flight of the Palestinian Arabs was transformed into a permanent mass exodus... .

As a West Semitic personal name it existed long before it became a tribal or a geographical name. This is not without significance, though is it rarely mentioned. We learn of a maryanu named ysr"il (*Yi¡sr—a"ilu) from Ugarit living in the same period, but the name was already used a thousand years before in Ebla. The word Israel originated as a West Semitic personal name. One of the many names that developed into the name of the ancestor of a clan, of a tribe and finally of a people and a nation.

The ensuing power struggle left Hyrcanus with a free hand in Judea, and he quickly reasserted Jewish sovereignty... Hyrcanus then engaged in a series of military campaigns aimed at territorial expansion. He first conquered areas in the Transjordan. He then turned his attention to Samaria, which had long separated Judea from the northern Jewish settlements in Lower Galilee. In the south, Adora and Marisa were conquered; (Aristobulus') primary accomplishment was annexing and Judaizing the region of Iturea, located between the Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon mountains ^ Ben-Sasson, H.H. (1976).

The expansion of Hasmonean Judea took place gradually. Under Jonathan, Judea annexed southern Samaria and began to expand in the direction of the coast plain... The main ethnic changes were the work of John Hyrcanus... it was in his days and those of his son Aristobulus that the annexation of Idumea, Samaria and Galilee and the consolidation of Jewish settlement in Trans-Jordan was completed. Alexander Jannai, continuing the work of his predecessors, expanded Judean rule to the entire coastal plain, from the Carmel to the Egyptian border... and to additional areas in Trans-Jordan, including some of the Greek cities there.

The year 70 ce marked transformations in demography, politics, Jewish civic status, Palestinian and more general Jewish economic and social structures, Jewish religious life beyond the sacrificial cult, and even Roman politics and the topography of the city of Rome itself. [...] The Revolt's failure had, to begin with, a demographic impact on the Jews of Palestine; many died in battle and as a result of siege conditions, not only in Jerusalem. [...] As indicated above, the figures for captives are conceivably more reliable. If 97,000 is roughly correct as a total for the war, it would mean that a huge percentage of the population was removed from the country, or at the very least displaced from their homes.

Scholars have long doubted the historical accuracy of Cassius Dio's account of the consequences of the Bar Kokhba War (Roman History 69.14). According to this text, considered the most reliable literary source for the Second Jewish Revolt, the war encompassed all of Judea: the Romans destroyed 985 villages and 50 fortresses, and killed 580,000 rebels. This article reassesses Cassius Dio's figures by drawing on new evidence from excavations and surveys in Judea, Transjordan, and the Galilee. Three research methods are combined: an ethno-archaeological comparison with the settlement picture in the Ottoman Period, comparison with similar settlement studies in the Galilee, and an evaluation of settled sites from the Middle Roman Period (70–136 CE). The study demonstrates the potential contribution of the archaeological record to this issue and supports the view of Cassius Dio's demographic data as a reliable account, which he based on contemporaneous documentation.

Land confiscation in Judaea was part of the suppression of the revolt policy of the Romans and punishment for the rebels. But the very claim that the sikarikon laws were annulled for settlement purposes seems to indicate that Jews continued to reside in Judaea even after the Second Revolt. There is no doubt that this area suffered the severest damage from the suppression of the revolt. Settlements in Judaea, such as Herodion and Bethar, had already been destroyed during the course of the revolt, and Jews were expelled from the districts of Gophna, Herodion, and Aqraba. However, it should not be claimed that the region of Judaea was completely destroyed. Jews continued to live in areas such as Lod (Lydda), south of the Hebron Mountain, and the coastal regions. In other areas of the Land of Israel that did not have any direct connection with the Second Revolt, no settlement changes can be identified as resulting from it.

The Jewish community strove to recover from the catastrophic results of the Bar Kokhva revolt (132–135 CE). Although some of these attempts were relatively successful, the Jews never fully recovered. During the Late Roman and Byzantine periods, many Jews emigrated to thriving centres in the diaspora, especially Iraq, whereas some converted to Christianity and others continued to live in the Holy Land, especially in Galilee and the coastal plain. During the Byzantine period, the three provinces of Palestine included more than thirty cities, namely, settlements with a bishop see. After the Muslim conquest in the 630s, most of these cities declined and eventually disappeared. As a result, in many cases the local ecclesiastical administration weakened, while in others it simply ceased to exist. Consequently, many local Christians converted to Islam. Thus, almost twelve centuries later, when the army led by Napoleon Bonaparte arrived in the Holy Land, most of the local population was Muslim.

Few would disagree that, in the century and a half before our period begins, the Jewish population of Judah () suffered a serious blow from which it never recovered. The destruction of the Jewish metropolis of Jerusalem and its environs and the eventual refounding of the city... had lasting repercussions. [...] However, in other parts of Palestine the Jewish population remained strong [...] What does seem clear is a different kind of change. Immigration of Christians and the conversion of pagans, Samaritans and Jews eventually produced a Christian majority ^ Bar, Doron (2003).

The dominant view of the history of Palestine during the Byzantine period links the early phases of the consecration of the land during the fourth century and the substantial external financial investment that accompanied the building of churches on holy sites on the one hand with the Christianisation of the population on the other. Churches were erected primarily at the holy sites, 12 while at the same time Palestine's position and unique status as the Christian 'Holy Land' became more firmly rooted. All this, coupled with immigration and conversion, allegedly meant that the Christianisation of Palestine took place much more rapidly than that of other areas of the Roman empire, brought in its wake the annihilation of the pagan cults and meant that by the middle of the fifth century there was a clear Christian majority.

From the data given above it can be concluded that the Muslim population of Central Samaria, during the early Muslim period, was not an autochthonous population which had converted to Christianity. They arrived there either by way of migration or as a result of a process of sedentarization of the nomads who had filled the vacuum created by the departing Samaritans at the end of the Byzantine period [...] To sum up: in the only rural region in Palestine in which, according to all the written and archeological sources, the process of Islamization was completed already in the twelfth century, there occurred events consistent with the model propounded by Levtzion and Vryonis: the region was abandoned by its original sedentary population and the vacuum was apparently filled by nomads who, at a later stage, gradually became sedentarized ^ Al-Fasi, D.

Another major cause of antagonism was the labor controversy. The hard core of Second Aliyah socialists, who were to become the Yishuv's leaders in the 1920s and 1930s, believed that the settler economy must not depend on or exploit Arab labor... But, in reality, rather than "meshing," the nationalist ethos had simply overpowered and driven out the socialist ethos... There were other reasons for the "conquest of labor." The socialists of the Second Aliyah used the term to denote three things: overcoming the Jews' traditional remove from agricultural labor and helping them transform into the "new Jews"; struggling against employers for better conditions; and replacing Arabs with Jews in manual jobs.

In addition, according to British records relied upon by the ad hoc committee, the Jewish population possessed registered ownership of only 5.6 percent of Palestine, and was eclipsed by the Arabs in land ownership in every one of Palestine's 16 sub-districts. Moreover, the quality of the land granted to the proposed Jewish state was highly skewed in its favour. UNSCOP reported that under its majority plan "[t]he Jews will have the more economically developed part of the country embracing practically the whole of the citrus-producing area"—Palestine's staple export crop—even though approximately half of the citrus-bearing land was owned by the Arabs. In addition, according to updated British records submitted to the ad hoc committee's two sub-committees, "of the irrigated, cultivable areas" of the country, 84 per cent would be in the Jewish State and 16 per cent would be in the Arab State"."

Although they were of the view that the Jewish national home promised in the Mandate was equivalent to a Jewish state, they well understood that such a claim could not be maintained under prevailing international law..Based on its own terms, it is impossible to escape the conclusion that the partition plan privileged European interests over those of Palestine's indigenous people and, as such, was an embodiment of the Eurocentricity of the international system that was allegedly a thing of the past. For this reason, the Arabs took a more principled position in line with prevailing international law, rejecting partition outright . .This rejection has disingenuously been presented in some of the literature as indicative of political intransigence,69 and even hostility towards the Jews as Jews' ^ Morris 2008 , p. 66: at 1946 "The League demanded independence for Palestine as a "unitary" state, with an Arab majority and minority rights for the Jews.", p. 67: at 1947 "The League's Political Committee met in Sofar, Lebanon, on 16–19 September, and urged the Palestine Arabs to fight partition, which it called "aggression," "without mercy."

the removal of the Egyptian blockade of the Straits of Tiran at the entrance of the Gulf of Aqaba. The blockade closed Israel's sea lane to East Africa and the Far East, hindering the development of Israel's southern port of Eilat and its hinterland, the Nege. Another important objective of the Israeli war plan was the elimination of the terrorist bases in the Gaza Strip, from which daily fedayeen incursions into Israel made life unbearable for its southern population. And last but not least, the concentration of the Egyptian forces in the Sinai Peninsula, armed with the newly acquired weapons from the Soviet bloc, prepared for an attack on Israel. Here, Ben-Gurion believed, was a time bomb that had to be defused before it was too late. Reaching the Suez Canal did not figure at all in Israel's war objectives.

The escalation continued with the Egyptian blockade of the Straits of Tiran, and Nasser's nationalization of the Suez Canal in July 1956. On October 14, Nasser made clear his intent:"I am not solely fighting against Israel itself. My task is to deliver the Arab world from destruction through Israel's intrigue, which has its roots abroad. Our hatred is very strong. There is no sense in talking about peace with Israel. There is not even the smallest place for negotiations." Less than two weeks later, on October 25, Egypt signed a tripartite agreement with Syria and Jordan placing Nasser in command of all three armies. The continued blockade of the Suez Canal and Gulf of Aqaba to Israeli shipping, combined with the increased fedayeen attacks and the bellicosity of recent Arab statements, prompted Israel, with the backing of Britain and France, to attack Egypt on October 29, 1956.

Although Eshkol denounced the Egyptians, his response to this development was a model of moderation. His speech on 21 May demanded that Nasser withdraw his forces from Sinai but made no mention of the removal of UNEF from the Straits nor of what Israel would do if they were closed to Israeli shipping. The next day Nasser announced to an astonished world that henceforth the Straits were, indeed, closed to all Israeli ships ^ Segev 2007 , p. 289.

This report focuses on the Israeli authorities' policies and actions in Gaza as part of the military offensive they launched in the wake of the Hamas-led attacks on 7 October 2023 while situating them within the broader context of Israel's unlawful occupation, and system of apartheid against Palestinians in Gaza, the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and Israel. It assesses allegations of violations and crimes under international law by Israel in Gaza within the framework of genocide under international law, concluding that there is sufficient evidence to believe that Israel's conduct in Gaza following 7 October 2023 amounts to genocide.

Killing tens of thousands of people; causing bodily or mental harm to hundreds of thousands more; destroying homes and civilian infrastructure on a massive scale; starvation, displacement, and denying humanitarian aid — all this is being perpetrated systematically, as part of a coordinated attack aimed at annihilating all facets of life in the Gaza Strip." ^ "Gaza: UN experts call on international community to prevent genocide against the Palestinian people" .

Grave violations committed by Israel against Palestinians in the aftermath of 7 October, particularly in Gaza, point to a genocide in the making, UN experts said today. They illustrated evidence of increasing genocidal incitement, overt intent to "destroy the Palestinian people under occupation", loud calls for a 'second Nakba' in Gaza and the rest of the occupied Palestinian territory, and the use of powerful weaponry with inherently indiscriminate impacts, resulting in a colossal death toll and destruction of life-sustaining infrastructure.

^ Jewish settlers can vote in Israeli elections, though West Bank is officially not Israel , Fox News, February 2015: "When Israelis go to the polls next month, tens of thousands of Jewish settlers in the West Bank will also be casting votes, even though they do not live on what is sovereign Israeli territory. This exception in a country that doesn't allow absentee voting for citizens living abroad is a telling reflection of Israel's somewhat ambiguous and highly contentious claim to the territory, which has been under military occupation for almost a half century." ^ The Social Composition of the 20th Knesset , Israeli Democracy Institute, 30 March 2015 ^ Halbfinger, David M.; McCann, Allison (28 February 2020).

The compromise, therefore, was to choose constructive ambiguity: as surprising as it may seem, there is no law that declares Judaism the official religion of Israel. However, there is no other law that declares Israel's neutrality toward all confessions. Judaism is not recognized as the official religion of the state, and even though the Jewish, Muslim and Christian clergy receive their salaries from the state, this fact does not make Israel a neutral state. This apparent pluralism cannot dissimulate the fact that Israel displays a clear and undoubtedly hierarchical pluralism in religious matters. ... It is important to note that from a multicultural point of view, this self-restrained secularism allows Muslim law to be practiced in Israel for personal matters of the Muslim community. As surprising as it seems, if not paradoxical for a state in war, Israel is the only Western democratic country in which Sharia enjoys such an official status.

It is true that Jewish Israelis, and secular Israelis in particular, conceive of religion as shaped by a state-sponsored religious establishment. There is no formal state religion in Israel, but the state gives its official recognition and financial support to particular religious communities, Jewish, Islamic and Christian, whose religious authorities and courts are empowered to deal with matters of personal status and family law, such as marriage, divorce, and alimony, that are binding on all members of the communities.

Although there is no official religion in Israel, there is also no clear separation between religion and state. In Israeli public life, tensions frequently arise among different streams of Judaism: Ultra-Orthodox, National-Religious, Mesorati (Conservative), Reconstructionist Progressive (Reform), and varying combinations of traditionalism and non-observance. Despite this variety in religious observances in society, Orthodox Judaism prevails institutionally over the other streams. This boundary is an historical consequence of the unique evolution of the relationship between Israel nationalism and state building. ... Since the founding period, in order to defuse religious tensions, the State of Israel has adopted what is known as the 'status quo,' an unwritten agreement stipulating that no further changes would be made in the status of religion, and that conflict between the observant and non-observant sectors would be handled circumstantially. The 'status quo' has since pertained to the legal status of both religious and secular Jews in Israel. This situation was designed to appease the religious sector, and has been upheld indefinitely through the disproportionate power of religious political parties in all subsequent coalition governments. ... On one hand, the Declaration of Independence adopted in 1948 explicitly guarantees freedom of religion. On the other, it simultaneously prevents the separation of religion and state in Israel.

Although the basic philosophy behind the law of military occupation is that it is a temporary situation modem occupations have well demonstrated that rien ne dure comme le provisoire A significant number of post-1945 occupations have lasted more than two decades such as the occupations of Namibia by South Africa and of East Timor by Indonesia as well as the ongoing occupations of Northern Cyprus by Turkey and of Western Sahara by Morocco.

It is now clear that Israel is a true democracy in its broadest sense only for its Jewish citizens. The Arab-Israeli (or, as some prefer, the Palestinian-Israeli) peoples, roughly 20 percent of the total population of Israel its pre-1967 boundaries, are citizens and have voting rights, but they face political, economic, and social discrimination. And, of course, Israeli democracy is inapplicable to the nearly 4 million Palestinian Arabs in the West Bank and Gaza, conquered by Israel in June 1967, who are occupied, repressed, and in many ways, directly and indirectly, effectively ruled by Israel.

The real controversy hovering over all the litigation on the security barrier concerns the fate of the Israeli settlements in the occupied territories. Since 1967, Israel has allowed and even encouraged its citizens to live in the new settlements established in the territories, motivated by religious and national sentiments attached to the history of the Jewish nation in the land of Israel. This policy has also been justified in terms of security interests, taking into consideration the dangerous geographic circumstances of Israel before 1967 (where Israeli areas on the Mediterranean coast were potentially threatened by Jordanian control of the West Bank ridge). The international community, for its part, has viewed this policy as patently illegal, based on the provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention that prohibit moving populations to or from territories under occupation.

(p.28) "The positions of the participants in the focus groups reflect the strength of Palestinian-Arab identity among Arab citizens and the fact that they do not see a contradiction between Palestinian-Arab national identity and Israeli civic identity. The designation "Israeli-Arab" aroused great opposition in the focus groups, as did Israel's Independence Day. ... The collective position presented in the focus group discussions finds expression in the public sphere and emphasizes the Palestinian national identity. Conversely, the responses of the survey participants reveal individual attitudes that assign a broader (albeit secondary, identity) dimension to the component of Israeli civic identity"; quote (p.25): The designation "Arab citizens of Israel" was acceptable to them on the basis of the understanding that it is impossible to live without citizenship, and as long as Israeli citizenship does not harm the national consciousness.

In 1948, the newly independent state of Israel took over the old British regulations that had set English, Arabic, and Hebrew as official languages for Mandatory Palestine but, as mentioned, dropped English from the list. In spite of this, official language use has maintained a de facto role for English, after Hebrew but before Arabic.
