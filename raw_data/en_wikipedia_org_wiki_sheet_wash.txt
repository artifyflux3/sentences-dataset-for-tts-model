[ 1 ] It occurs in a wide range of settings such as coastal plains , hill slopes, floodplains , beaches , [ 2 ] savanna plains [ 3 ] and semi-arid plains.

[ 4 ] Water moving fairly uniformly with a similar thickness over a surface is called sheet flow, and is the cause of sheet erosion.

[ 2 ] Sheet erosion implies that any flow of water that causes the erosion is not canalized.

[ 2 ] If a hillslope surface contains many irregularities, sheet erosion may give way to erosion along small channels called rills , which can then converge forming gullies .

[ 2 ] [ 5 ] However, sheet erosion may occur despite some limited unevenness in the sheet flow arising from clods of earth, rock fragments, or vegetation.

[ 2 ] Sheet erosion occurs in two steps. First, rainsplash dislodges small particles of the substrate and then the particles are carried away, usually short distances, by a thin and uniform layer of water (sheet flow).

[ 5 ] Transport by the sheet flow is usually over small distances, meaning that sheet erosion is a low magnitude process.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] However, the frequency over time with which this occurs may be high, compensating for the small change observed in each individual episode of sheet erosion.

[ 6 ] A sheetflood can be distinguished from an ordinary sheet flow by its much greater magnitude and much lesser frequency.

[ 6 ] Sheetfloods have been associated by various scientists with a number of causes, including high-intensity rain, low relief , lack of vegetation, low permeability of the substrate, strong weather contrast between seasons, slope form and climate change . Sheetfloods are commonly turbulent while sheetflow may be laminar or turbulent.

[ 6 ] Sheet erosion is common in recently ploughed fields and bare ground where the substrate, typically soil, is not consolidated.

[ 5 ] The resulting loss of material by sheet erosion may result in the destruction of valuable topsoils .

[ 5 ] Tough grass , such as vetiver , hinders the development of sheet flow.

[ 7 ] The sheet erosion caused by a single rainstorm may account for the loss of up to hundred tons of small particles in an acre .

[ 5 ] It has been argued that in the late Neoproterozoic Era , sheet erosion was a dominant erosion process due to the lack of plants on land.

[ 8 ] As such, sheet erosion may have contributed to shaping important landforms like the Sub-Cambrian peneplain that covers much of the Baltic Shield .
