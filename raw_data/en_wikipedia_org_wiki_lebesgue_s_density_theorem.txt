Additionally, the "density" of A is 1 at almost every point in A .   Intuitively, this means that the "edge" of A , the set of points in A whose "neighborhood" is partially in A and partially outside of A , is negligible .

Let Œº be the Lebesgue measure on  the Euclidean space R n and A be a Lebesgue measurable subset of R n . Define the approximate density of A in a Œµ-neighborhood of a point x in R n as d Œµ Œµ ( x ) = Œº Œº ( A ‚à© ‚à© B Œµ Œµ ( x ) ) Œº Œº ( B Œµ Œµ ( x ) ) {\displaystyle d_{\varepsilon }(x)={\frac {\mu (A\cap B_{\varepsilon }(x))}{\mu (B_{\varepsilon }(x))}}} where B Œµ denotes the closed ball of radius Œµ centered at x .

Lebesgue's density theorem asserts that for almost every point x of R n the density d ( x ) = lim Œµ Œµ ‚Üí ‚Üí 0 d Œµ Œµ ( x ) {\displaystyle d(x)=\lim _{\varepsilon \to 0}d_{\varepsilon }(x)} exists and is equal to 0 or 1.

In other words, for every measurable set A , the density of A is 0 or 1 almost everywhere in R n .

[ 1 ] However, if Œº( A )¬†>¬†0 and Œº( R n \ A ) > 0 , then there are always points of R n where the density either does not exist or exists but is neither 0 nor¬†1 (, [ 2 ] Lemma 4).

For example, given a square in the plane, the density at every point inside the square is 1, on the edges is 1/2, and at the corners is 1/4.  The set of points in the plane at which the density is neither 0 nor 1 is non-empty (the square boundary), but it is negligible.

The Lebesgue density theorem is a particular case of the Lebesgue differentiation theorem .

Thus, this theorem is also true for every finite Borel measure on R n instead of Lebesgue measure, see Discussion .
