However, several alternative measures of stress can be defined: [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] The Kirchhoff stress ( τ τ {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\tau }}} ).

The nominal stress ( N {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {N}}} ).

The Piola–Kirchhoff stress tensors The first Piola–Kirchhoff stress ( P {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {P}}} ).  This stress tensor is the transpose of the nominal stress ( P = N T {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {P}}={\boldsymbol {N}}^{T}} ).

The second Piola–Kirchhoff stress or PK2 stress ( S {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {S}}} ).

The Biot stress ( T {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {T}}} ) Definitions [ edit ] Consider the situation shown in the following figure. The following definitions use the notations shown in the figure.

Quantities used in the definition of stress measures In the reference configuration Ω Ω 0 {\displaystyle \Omega _{0}} , the outward normal to a surface element d Γ Γ 0 {\displaystyle d\Gamma _{0}} is N ≡ ≡ n 0 {\displaystyle \mathbf {N} \equiv \mathbf {n} _{0}} and the traction acting on that surface (assuming it deforms like a generic vector belonging to the deformation) is t 0 {\displaystyle \mathbf {t} _{0}} leading to a force vector d f 0 {\displaystyle d\mathbf {f} _{0}} .  In the deformed configuration Ω Ω {\displaystyle \Omega } , the surface element changes to d Γ Γ {\displaystyle d\Gamma } with outward normal n {\displaystyle \mathbf {n} } and traction vector t {\displaystyle \mathbf {t} } leading to a force d f {\displaystyle d\mathbf {f} } .  Note that this surface can either be a hypothetical cut inside the body or an actual surface.  The quantity F {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {F}}} is the deformation gradient tensor , J {\displaystyle J} is its determinant.

Cauchy stress [ edit ] The Cauchy stress (or true stress) is a measure of the force acting on an element of area in the deformed configuration.  This tensor is symmetric and is defined via d f = t d Γ Γ = σ σ T ⋅ ⋅ n d Γ Γ {\displaystyle d\mathbf {f} =\mathbf {t} ~d\Gamma ={\boldsymbol {\sigma }}^{T}\cdot \mathbf {n} ~d\Gamma } or t = σ σ T ⋅ ⋅ n {\displaystyle \mathbf {t} ={\boldsymbol {\sigma }}^{T}\cdot \mathbf {n} } where t {\displaystyle \mathbf {t} } is the traction and n {\displaystyle \mathbf {n} } is the normal to the surface on which the traction acts.

Kirchhoff stress [ edit ] The quantity, τ τ = J σ σ {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\tau }}=J~{\boldsymbol {\sigma }}} is called the Kirchhoff stress tensor , with J {\displaystyle J} the determinant of F {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {F}}} . It is used widely in numerical algorithms in metal plasticity (where there
is no change in volume during plastic deformation). It can be called weighted Cauchy stress tensor as well.

Piola–Kirchhoff stress [ edit ] Main article: Piola–Kirchhoff stress tensor Nominal stress/First Piola–Kirchhoff stress [ edit ] The nominal stress N = P T {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {N}}={\boldsymbol {P}}^{T}} is the transpose of the first Piola–Kirchhoff stress (PK1 stress, also called engineering stress) P {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {P}}} and is defined via d f = t d Γ Γ = N T ⋅ ⋅ n 0 d Γ Γ 0 = P ⋅ ⋅ n 0 d Γ Γ 0 {\displaystyle d\mathbf {f} =\mathbf {t} ~d\Gamma ={\boldsymbol {N}}^{T}\cdot \mathbf {n} _{0}~d\Gamma _{0}={\boldsymbol {P}}\cdot \mathbf {n} _{0}~d\Gamma _{0}} or t 0 = t d Γ Γ d Γ Γ 0 = N T ⋅ ⋅ n 0 = P ⋅ ⋅ n 0 {\displaystyle \mathbf {t} _{0}=\mathbf {t} {\dfrac {d{\Gamma }}{d\Gamma _{0}}}={\boldsymbol {N}}^{T}\cdot \mathbf {n} _{0}={\boldsymbol {P}}\cdot \mathbf {n} _{0}} This stress is unsymmetric and is a two-point tensor like the deformation gradient.

The asymmetry derives from the fact that, as a tensor, it has one index attached to the reference configuration and one to the deformed configuration.

[ 4 ] Second Piola–Kirchhoff stress [ edit ] If we pull back d f {\displaystyle d\mathbf {f} } to the reference configuration we obtain the traction acting on that surface before the deformation d f 0 {\displaystyle d\mathbf {f} _{0}} assuming it behaves like a generic vector belonging to the deformation. In particular we have d f 0 = F − − 1 ⋅ ⋅ d f {\displaystyle d\mathbf {f} _{0}={\boldsymbol {F}}^{-1}\cdot d\mathbf {f} } or, d f 0 = F − − 1 ⋅ ⋅ N T ⋅ ⋅ n 0 d Γ Γ 0 = F − − 1 ⋅ ⋅ t 0 d Γ Γ 0 {\displaystyle d\mathbf {f} _{0}={\boldsymbol {F}}^{-1}\cdot {\boldsymbol {N}}^{T}\cdot \mathbf {n} _{0}~d\Gamma _{0}={\boldsymbol {F}}^{-1}\cdot \mathbf {t} _{0}~d\Gamma _{0}} The PK2 stress ( S {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {S}}} ) is symmetric and is defined via the relation d f 0 = S T ⋅ ⋅ n 0 d Γ Γ 0 = F − − 1 ⋅ ⋅ t 0 d Γ Γ 0 {\displaystyle d\mathbf {f} _{0}={\boldsymbol {S}}^{T}\cdot \mathbf {n} _{0}~d\Gamma _{0}={\boldsymbol {F}}^{-1}\cdot \mathbf {t} _{0}~d\Gamma _{0}} Therefore, S T ⋅ ⋅ n 0 = F − − 1 ⋅ ⋅ t 0 {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {S}}^{T}\cdot \mathbf {n} _{0}={\boldsymbol {F}}^{-1}\cdot \mathbf {t} _{0}} Biot stress [ edit ] The Biot stress is useful because it is energy conjugate to the right stretch tensor U {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {U}}} .  The Biot stress is defined as the symmetric part of the tensor P T ⋅ ⋅ R {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {P}}^{T}\cdot {\boldsymbol {R}}} where R {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {R}}} is the rotation tensor obtained from a polar decomposition of the deformation gradient.  Therefore, the Biot stress tensor is defined as T = 1 2 ( R T ⋅ ⋅ P + P T ⋅ ⋅ R ) .

{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {T}}={\tfrac {1}{2}}({\boldsymbol {R}}^{T}\cdot {\boldsymbol {P}}+{\boldsymbol {P}}^{T}\cdot {\boldsymbol {R}})~.} The Biot stress is also called the Jaumann stress.

The quantity T {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {T}}} does not have any physical interpretation.  However, the unsymmetrized Biot stress has the interpretation R T d f = ( P T ⋅ ⋅ R ) T ⋅ ⋅ n 0 d Γ Γ 0 {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {R}}^{T}~d\mathbf {f} =({\boldsymbol {P}}^{T}\cdot {\boldsymbol {R}})^{T}\cdot \mathbf {n} _{0}~d\Gamma _{0}} Relations [ edit ] Relations between Cauchy stress and nominal stress [ edit ] From Nanson's formula relating areas in the reference and deformed configurations: n d Γ Γ = J F − − T ⋅ ⋅ n 0 d Γ Γ 0 {\displaystyle \mathbf {n} ~d\Gamma =J~{\boldsymbol {F}}^{-T}\cdot \mathbf {n} _{0}~d\Gamma _{0}} Now, σ σ T ⋅ ⋅ n d Γ Γ = d f = N T ⋅ ⋅ n 0 d Γ Γ 0 {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\sigma }}^{T}\cdot \mathbf {n} ~d\Gamma =d\mathbf {f} ={\boldsymbol {N}}^{T}\cdot \mathbf {n} _{0}~d\Gamma _{0}} Hence, σ σ T ⋅ ⋅ ( J F − − T ⋅ ⋅ n 0 d Γ Γ 0 ) = N T ⋅ ⋅ n 0 d Γ Γ 0 {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\sigma }}^{T}\cdot (J~{\boldsymbol {F}}^{-T}\cdot \mathbf {n} _{0}~d\Gamma _{0})={\boldsymbol {N}}^{T}\cdot \mathbf {n} _{0}~d\Gamma _{0}} or, N T = J ( F − − 1 ⋅ ⋅ σ σ ) T = J σ σ T ⋅ ⋅ F − − T {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {N}}^{T}=J~({\boldsymbol {F}}^{-1}\cdot {\boldsymbol {\sigma }})^{T}=J~{\boldsymbol {\sigma }}^{T}\cdot {\boldsymbol {F}}^{-T}} or, N = J F − − 1 ⋅ ⋅ σ σ and N T = P = J σ σ T ⋅ ⋅ F − − T {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {N}}=J~{\boldsymbol {F}}^{-1}\cdot {\boldsymbol {\sigma }}\qquad {\text{and}}\qquad {\boldsymbol {N}}^{T}={\boldsymbol {P}}=J~{\boldsymbol {\sigma }}^{T}\cdot {\boldsymbol {F}}^{-T}} In index notation, N I j = J F I k − − 1 σ σ k j and P i J = J σ σ k i F J k − − 1 {\displaystyle N_{Ij}=J~F_{Ik}^{-1}~\sigma _{kj}\qquad {\text{and}}\qquad P_{iJ}=J~\sigma _{ki}~F_{Jk}^{-1}} Therefore, J σ σ = F ⋅ ⋅ N = F ⋅ ⋅ P T .

{\displaystyle J~{\boldsymbol {\sigma }}={\boldsymbol {F}}\cdot {\boldsymbol {N}}={\boldsymbol {F}}\cdot {\boldsymbol {P}}^{T}~.} Note that N {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {N}}} and P {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {P}}} are (generally) not symmetric because F {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {F}}} is (generally) not symmetric.

Relations between nominal stress and second P–K stress [ edit ] Recall that N T ⋅ ⋅ n 0 d Γ Γ 0 = d f {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {N}}^{T}\cdot \mathbf {n} _{0}~d\Gamma _{0}=d\mathbf {f} } and d f = F ⋅ ⋅ d f 0 = F ⋅ ⋅ ( S T ⋅ ⋅ n 0 d Γ Γ 0 ) {\displaystyle d\mathbf {f} ={\boldsymbol {F}}\cdot d\mathbf {f} _{0}={\boldsymbol {F}}\cdot ({\boldsymbol {S}}^{T}\cdot \mathbf {n} _{0}~d\Gamma _{0})} Therefore, N T ⋅ ⋅ n 0 = F ⋅ ⋅ S T ⋅ ⋅ n 0 {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {N}}^{T}\cdot \mathbf {n} _{0}={\boldsymbol {F}}\cdot {\boldsymbol {S}}^{T}\cdot \mathbf {n} _{0}} or (using the symmetry of S {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {S}}} ), N = S ⋅ ⋅ F T and P = F ⋅ ⋅ S {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {N}}={\boldsymbol {S}}\cdot {\boldsymbol {F}}^{T}\qquad {\text{and}}\qquad {\boldsymbol {P}}={\boldsymbol {F}}\cdot {\boldsymbol {S}}} In index notation, N I j = S I K F j K T and P i J = F i K S K J {\displaystyle N_{Ij}=S_{IK}~F_{jK}^{T}\qquad {\text{and}}\qquad P_{iJ}=F_{iK}~S_{KJ}} Alternatively, we can write S = N ⋅ ⋅ F − − T and S = F − − 1 ⋅ ⋅ P {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {S}}={\boldsymbol {N}}\cdot {\boldsymbol {F}}^{-T}\qquad {\text{and}}\qquad {\boldsymbol {S}}={\boldsymbol {F}}^{-1}\cdot {\boldsymbol {P}}} Relations between Cauchy stress and second P–K stress [ edit ] Recall that N = J F − − 1 ⋅ ⋅ σ σ {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {N}}=J~{\boldsymbol {F}}^{-1}\cdot {\boldsymbol {\sigma }}} In terms of the 2nd PK stress, we have S ⋅ ⋅ F T = J F − − 1 ⋅ ⋅ σ σ {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {S}}\cdot {\boldsymbol {F}}^{T}=J~{\boldsymbol {F}}^{-1}\cdot {\boldsymbol {\sigma }}} Therefore, S = J F − − 1 ⋅ ⋅ σ σ ⋅ ⋅ F − − T = F − − 1 ⋅ ⋅ τ τ ⋅ ⋅ F − − T {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {S}}=J~{\boldsymbol {F}}^{-1}\cdot {\boldsymbol {\sigma }}\cdot {\boldsymbol {F}}^{-T}={\boldsymbol {F}}^{-1}\cdot {\boldsymbol {\tau }}\cdot {\boldsymbol {F}}^{-T}} In index notation, S I J = F I k − − 1 τ τ k l F J l − − 1 {\displaystyle S_{IJ}=F_{Ik}^{-1}~\tau _{kl}~F_{Jl}^{-1}} Since the Cauchy stress (and hence the Kirchhoff stress) is symmetric, the 2nd PK stress is also symmetric.

Alternatively, we can write σ σ = J − − 1 F ⋅ ⋅ S ⋅ ⋅ F T {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\sigma }}=J^{-1}~{\boldsymbol {F}}\cdot {\boldsymbol {S}}\cdot {\boldsymbol {F}}^{T}} or, τ τ = F ⋅ ⋅ S ⋅ ⋅ F T .

{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\tau }}={\boldsymbol {F}}\cdot {\boldsymbol {S}}\cdot {\boldsymbol {F}}^{T}~.} Clearly, from definition of the push-forward and pull-back operations, we have S = φ φ ∗ ∗ [ τ τ ] = F − − 1 ⋅ ⋅ τ τ ⋅ ⋅ F − − T {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {S}}=\varphi ^{*}[{\boldsymbol {\tau }}]={\boldsymbol {F}}^{-1}\cdot {\boldsymbol {\tau }}\cdot {\boldsymbol {F}}^{-T}} and τ τ = φ φ ∗ ∗ [ S ] = F ⋅ ⋅ S ⋅ ⋅ F T .

{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\tau }}=\varphi _{*}[{\boldsymbol {S}}]={\boldsymbol {F}}\cdot {\boldsymbol {S}}\cdot {\boldsymbol {F}}^{T}~.} Therefore, S {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {S}}} is the pull back of τ τ {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\tau }}} by F {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {F}}} and τ τ {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\tau }}} is the push forward of S {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {S}}} .
