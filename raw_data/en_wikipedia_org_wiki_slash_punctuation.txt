The **slash** is a slanting line [punctuation mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punctuation_mark "Punctuation mark")/. It is also known as a **stroke**, a **solidus**, a **forward slash** and [several other historical or technical names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#Alternative_names). Once used as the equivalent of the modern [period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop "Full stop") and [comma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma "Comma"), the slash is now used to represent [division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#Division) and [fractions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#Fractions), as a [date separator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#Dating), in between multiple alternative or related terms, and to indicate abbreviation.

A slash in the reverse direction \ is a [backslash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backslash "Backslash").

Slashes may be found in early writing as a variant form of [dashes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dash_(typography) "Dash (typography)"), [vertical strokes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_bar "Vertical bar"), etc. The present use of a slash distinguished from such other marks derives from the [medieval European](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_Europe "Medieval Europe")[virgule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#virgule) ([Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_language "Latin language"): _virgula_, lit. "twig"), which was used as a [period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop "Full stop"), [scratch comma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#scratch), and [caesura mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesura_mark "Caesura mark").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#cite_note-virg-1) (The first sense was eventually lost to the [low dot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop "Full stop") and the other two developed separately into the [comma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma "Comma"), and [caesura mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesura_mark "Caesura mark")||) Its use as a comma became especially widespread in [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_France "Kingdom of France"), where it was also used to mark the continuation of a word onto the next line of a page, a sense later taken on by the [hyphen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen "Hyphen")-.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#cite_note-partridge-2) The [Fraktur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraktur "Fraktur") script used throughout [Central Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Europe "Central Europe") in the [early modern period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_modern_period "Early modern period") used a single slash as a scratch comma and a double slash // as a dash. The double slash developed into the [double oblique hyphen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_hyphen "Double hyphen")⸗ and [double hyphen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_hyphen "Double hyphen")⹀ before being usually simplified into [various single dashes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dash "Dash").

In the 18th century, the mark was generally known in English as the "[oblique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#oblique)".[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#cite_note-oedobli-3) but particularly the less vertical [fraction slash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#fraction).[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#cite_note-4) The variant "oblique stroke" was increasingly shortened to "[stroke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#stroke)", which became the common British name for the character, although printers and publishing professionals often instead referred to it as an "oblique". In the 19th and early 20th century, it was also widely known as the "[shilling mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#shilling)" or "[solidus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#solidus)", from its use as a notation or abbreviation for the [shilling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shilling "Shilling").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#cite_note-oedshill-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#cite_note-oedsolid-6) The name "slash" is a recent development, not appearing in [Webster's Dictionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webster%27s_Dictionary "Webster's Dictionary") until the Third Edition (1961)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#cite_note-7)[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#cite_note-9) but has gained wide currency through its use in [computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#Computing), a context where it is sometimes used in British English in preference to "stroke". Clarifying terms such as "forward slash" have been coined owing to widespread use of [Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft "Microsoft")'s [DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS "MS-DOS") and [Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_(OS) "Windows (OS)")[operating systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system "Operating system"), which use the [backslash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backslash "Backslash") extensively.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#cite_note-jed-10)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#cite_note-turton-11)

### Disjunction and conjunction

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Slash_(punctuation)&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Disjunction and conjunction")]

#### Connecting alternatives

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Slash_(punctuation)&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Connecting alternatives")]

The slash is commonly used in many languages as a shorter substitute for the [conjunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunction_(grammar)#Coordinating_conjunctions "Conjunction (grammar)") "or", typically with the sense of [exclusive or](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or "Exclusive or") (e.g., Y/N permits yes or no but not both).[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#cite_note-solidhart-12) Its use in this sense is somewhat informal,[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#cite_note-cms104-13) although it is used in [philology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philology "Philology") to note variants (e.g., _virgula/uirgula_) and [etymologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etymology "Etymology") (e.g., [F.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language "French language")_virgule_/[LL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Latin "Late Latin"). _virgula_/[L.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Latin "Classical Latin")_virga_/[PIE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European "Proto-Indo-European"). *_wirgā_).[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#cite_note-partridge-2)

Such slashes may be used to avoid taking a position in [naming disputes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnonym "Ethnonym"). One example is the [Assyrian naming dispute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terms_for_Syriac_Christians "Terms for Syriac Christians"), which prompted the [US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_census "US census") and [Swedish censuses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_census "Swedish census") to use the respective official designations "[Assyrian/Chaldean/Syriac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assyrian/Chaldean/Syriac "Assyrian/Chaldean/Syriac")" and "[Assyrier/Syrianer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assyrier/Syrianer "Assyrier/Syrianer")" for the ethnic group.

In particular, since the late 20th century, the slash is used to permit more [gender-neutral language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender-neutral_language "Gender-neutral language") in place of the traditional [masculine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/He_(pronoun) "He (pronoun)") or [plural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_they "Singular they") gender neutrals. In the case of [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language "English language"), this is usually restricted to [degendered pronouns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender-specific_and_gender-neutral_pronouns "Gender-specific and gender-neutral pronouns") such as "he/she" or "s/he". Most other [Indo-European languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_languages "Indo-European languages") include more far-reaching use of [grammatical gender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_gender "Grammatical gender"). In these, the separate gendered [desinences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desinence "Desinence") (grammatical suffices) of the words may be given divided by slashes or set off with [parentheses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parentheses "Parentheses"). For example, in [Spanish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language "Spanish language"), _hijo_ is a son and a _hija_ is a daughter; some proponents of gender-neutral language advocate the use of _hijo/a_, _hijo(a)_ or _hija/hijo_ when writing for a general audience or addressing a listener of unknown gender.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#cite_note-14)[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#cite_note-15)[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#cite_note-16) Less commonly, [at sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_sign#Gender_neutrality_in_Spanish "At sign")⟨@⟩ is used instead: _hij@_. Similarly, in [German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language "German language") and some Scandinavian and Baltic languages, _Sekretär_ refers to any secretary and _Sekretärin_ to an explicitly female secretary; some advocates of gender neutrality support forms such as _Sekretär/-in_ for general use. This does not always work smoothly, however: problems arise in the case of words like _Arzt_ ('doctor') where the explicitly female form _Ärztin_ is [umlauted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umlaut_(diacritic) "Umlaut (diacritic)") and words like _Chinese_ ('Chinese person') where the explicitly female form _Chinesin_ loses the terminal _-e_.

Although not as common as [brackets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brackets "Brackets"), slashes can also be used for [words the author do not know is plural or singular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertain_plural "Uncertain plural") such as "child/ren", "is/are", "book/s", "answer/s" or "fix/es".

#### Connecting non-contrasting items

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Slash_(punctuation)&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Connecting non-contrasting items")]

The slash is also used as a shorter substitute for the conjunction "and" or [inclusive or](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclusive_or "Inclusive or") (i.e., A or B or both),[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#cite_note-cms104-13) typically in situations where it fills the role of a hyphen or [en dash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/En_dash "En dash"). For example, the "Hemingway/Faulkner generation" might be used to discuss the era of the [Lost Generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Generation "Lost Generation") inclusive of the people around and affected by both [Hemingway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Hemingway "Ernest Hemingway") and [Faulkner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Faulkner "William Faulkner"). This use is sometimes proscribed, as by _[New Hart's Rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New\_Hart%27s\_Rules "New Hart's Rules")_, the style guide for the [Oxford University Press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_University_Press "Oxford University Press").[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#cite_note-solidhart-12)

The slash, as a form of inclusive or, is also used to punctuate the stages of a route (e.g., [Shanghai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai "Shanghai")/[Nanjing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanjing "Nanjing")/[Wuhan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan "Wuhan")/[Chongqing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chongqing "Chongqing") as stops on a tour of the [Yangtze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangtze_River "Yangtze River")).[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#cite_note-partridge-2)

#### Introducing topic shifts

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Slash_(punctuation)&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Introducing topic shifts")]

The word _slash_ is also developing as a way to introduce topic shifts or follow-up statements. _Slash_ can introduce a follow-up statement, such as, "I really love that hot dog place on Liberty Street. Slash can we go there tomorrow?" It can also indicate a shift to an unrelated topic, as in "JUST SAW ALEX! Slash I just chubbed on oatmeal raisin cookies at north quad and i miss you." The new usage of "slash" appears most frequently in spoken conversation, though it can also appear in writing.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#cite_note-17)

Sometimes the word _slash_ is used in speech as a [conjunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunction_(grammar) "Conjunction (grammar)") to represent the written role of the character (as if a written slash were being read aloud from text), e.g. "bee slash mosquito protection" for a beekeeper's net hood,[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#cite_note-18) and "There's a little bit of nectar slash honey over here, but really it's not a lot." (said by a beekeeper examining in a beehive),[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#cite_note-19) and "_[Gastornis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastornis "Gastornis")_ slash _[Diatryma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diatryma "Diatryma")_" for two supposed genera of prehistoric birds which are now thought to be one genus.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#cite_note-20)

The slash is used between two numbers to indicate a [fraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction "Fraction") or [ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio "Ratio"). Such formatting developed as a way to write the horizontal [fraction bar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction_bar "Fraction bar") on a single line of text. It is first attested in [England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_England "Kingdom of England") and [Mexico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viceroyalty_of_Mexico "Viceroyalty of Mexico") in the 18th century.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#cite_note-jeff-21) This notation is known as an online, solidus,[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#cite_note-Eckersley_et_al-22) or shilling fraction.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#cite_note-Eckersley_et_al-22) Nowadays fractions, unlike inline division, are often given using smaller numbers, [superscript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superscript "Superscript"), and [subscript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subscript "Subscript") (e.g., 23/43). This notation is responsible for the current form of the [percent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent_sign "Percent sign")%, [permille](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permille "Permille")‰, and [permyriad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permyriad "Permyriad")‱ signs, developed from the horizontal form ⁠0/0⁠ which represented an early modern corruption of an Italian abbreviation of _per cento_.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#cite_note-23)

This notation can also be used when the concept of fractions is extended from numbers to arbitrary rings by the method of [localization of a ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Localization_of_a_ring "Localization of a ring").

The division slash ∕ is used between two numbers to indicate [division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_(math) "Division (math)").[[b]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#cite_note-25) This use developed from the [fraction slash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction_slash "Fraction slash") in the late 18th or early 19th century.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#cite_note-jeff-21) The formatting was advocated by [De Morgan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus_De_Morgan "Augustus De Morgan") in the mid-19th century.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#cite_note-26)[_[full citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing\_sources#What\_information\_to\_include "Wikipedia:Citing sources")_],[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#cite_note-DeM-27) who wrote:

The occurrence of fractions, such as ⁠a/b⁠, ⁠a+b/c+d⁠, in the verbal part of mathematical works is a source of considerable loss of room, and creates an inelegant and even confused appearance in the printed page. It is very desirable, in every point of view, except the strictly mathematical one, that some method of representation should be adopted which does not require a larger space than is usual between two successive lines. At the same time, it is by no means of very great importance that the verbal part should entirely coincide with the mathematical part in notation, so long as the latter remains to preserve the usual conventions. The symbol ÷ has been disused for a sufficient reason, namely, the number of times which the pen must be taken off to form it. This has been, and we imagine always will be, the cause either of abandonment or abbreviation. The question is, whether a new and easy notation could not be substituted; and it is desirable that it should be derived from analogy, such as (accidentally, we believe) does exist in >, =, and <. If we look at × and +, and observe that the first is made by turning the second through half a right angle, denoting multiplication, which is primarily an extension of addition in like manner as division is an extension of subtraction, we may thus invent the symbol / or \ to denote division, which is also the symbol of subtraction turned through half a right angle. If a/b were used to denote a divided by b, and (a+b)/(c+d) to denote a + b divided by c + d, all necessity for increased spacing would be avoided; but this alteration should not be introduced into completely mathematical expressions, though it would be convenient in particular cases.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#cite_note-DeM-27)
A _quotient of a set_ is informally a new set obtained by identifying some elements of the original set. This is denoted as a fraction ![Image 1: {\displaystyle S/R}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2223297d422eaf46aeca7b62cb8479918422b29b) (sometimes even as a built fraction), where the numerator ![Image 2: {\displaystyle S}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4611d85173cd3b508e67077d4a1252c9c05abca2) is the original set (often equipped with some algebraic structure). What is appropriate as denominator depends on the context.

In the most general case, the denominator is an [equivalence relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_relation "Equivalence relation")![Image 3: {\displaystyle \sim }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/afcc42adfcfdc24d5c4c474869e5d8eaa78d1173) on the original set ![Image 4: {\displaystyle S}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4611d85173cd3b508e67077d4a1252c9c05abca2), and elements are to be identified in the quotient ![Image 5: {\displaystyle S/{\sim }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/da3d666eebe304481e0ad243dcdf61fa68751063) if they are equivalent according to ![Image 6: {\displaystyle \sim }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/afcc42adfcfdc24d5c4c474869e5d8eaa78d1173); this is technically achieved by making ![Image 7: {\displaystyle S/{\sim }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/da3d666eebe304481e0ad243dcdf61fa68751063) the set of all [equivalence classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_class "Equivalence class") of ![Image 8: {\displaystyle \sim }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/afcc42adfcfdc24d5c4c474869e5d8eaa78d1173).

In [group theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_theory "Group theory"), the slash is used to mark [quotient groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotient_group "Quotient group"). The general form is ![Image 9: {\displaystyle G/N}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ab52bff253c690c4e0d473400ab8c365ea019298), where ![Image 10: {\displaystyle G}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f5f3c8921a3b352de45446a6789b104458c9f90b) is the original group and ![Image 11: {\displaystyle N}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f5e3890c981ae85503089652feb48b191b57aae3) is the normal subgroup; this is read "![Image 12: {\displaystyle G}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f5f3c8921a3b352de45446a6789b104458c9f90b) mod ![Image 13: {\displaystyle N}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f5e3890c981ae85503089652feb48b191b57aae3)", where "mod" is short for "[modulo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation "Modulo operation")". Formally this is a special case of quotient by an equivalence relation, where ![Image 14: {\displaystyle g\sim h}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c8907be3a0d650cab1a9cf751e7727155d73a03d) iff ![Image 15: {\displaystyle g=hn}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fad68b6b40cc511feadd7dbfaeb75fb94e4949f2) for some ![Image 16: {\displaystyle n\in N}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/aedc99ee9cd35f9c34b0f743f8c26b34359ca2fe). Since many algebraic structures ([rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_(mathematics) "Ring (mathematics)"), [vector spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space"), etc.) in particular are groups, the same style of quotients extend also to these, although the denominator may need to satisfy additional [closure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(mathematics) "Closure (mathematics)") properties for the quotient to preserve the full algebraic structure of the original (e.g. for the quotient of a ring to be a ring, the denominator must be an [ideal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_(ring_theory) "Ideal (ring theory)")).

When the original set is the set of [integers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer "Integer")![Image 17: {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/449494a083e0a1fda2b61c62b2f09b6bee4633dc), the denominator may alternatively be just an integer: ![Image 18: {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} /n}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/64813bfce60c9ac335f0c1efa5d03ed7a6550172). This is an alternative notation for the set ![Image 19: {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} _{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7b729c334a9863c47f0b7e3ad61342c2f0881bdb) of [integers modulo _n_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_arithmetic#Integers_modulo_m "Modular arithmetic") (needed because ![Image 20: {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} _{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7b729c334a9863c47f0b7e3ad61342c2f0881bdb) is also notation for the very different [ring of _n_-adic integers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-adic_number "P-adic number")). ![Image 21: {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} /n}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/64813bfce60c9ac335f0c1efa5d03ed7a6550172) is an abbreviation of ![Image 22: {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} /n\mathbb {Z} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f2120ebbc85f91df66c6de5446367bf9fd620844) or ![Image 23: {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} /(n)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0639d2973f71226a502767b14c0b7f9f5876c6c2), which both are ways of writing the set in question as a quotient of groups.

Slashes may also be used as a [combining character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combining_character "Combining character") in mathematical formulae. The most important use of this is that combining a slash with a [relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_relation "Binary relation") negates it, producing e.g. 'not equal' ![Image 24: {\displaystyle \neq }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/38cc3d8d8c60120bc2f905bae4d5e10d8ad6a3f4) as negation of ![Image 25: {\displaystyle =}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/505a4ceef454c69dffd23792c84b90f488543743) or 'not in' ![Image 26: {\displaystyle \notin }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/33dea9a3a3f311cc734ffd570e8f697ea1560a90) as negation of ![Image 27: {\displaystyle \in }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6fe4d5b0a594c1da89b5e78e7dfbeed90bdcc32f); these slashed relation symbols are always implicitly defined in terms of the non-slashed base symbol. The graphical form of the negation slash is mostly the same as for a division slash, except in some cases where that would look odd; the negation ![Image 28: {\displaystyle \nmid }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0698c887774735c30f8ae93987bc2f1b6d442962) of ![Image 29: {\displaystyle \mid }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8f7b2136e276c4aec285a6c40b91180c16432b9b) (divides) and negation ![Image 30: {\displaystyle \nsim }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0bb24e1914cfde8a8abf56fce4f6370532c16e0e) of ![Image 31: {\displaystyle \sim }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/afcc42adfcfdc24d5c4c474869e5d8eaa78d1173) (various meanings) customarily both have their negations slashes less steep and in particular shorter than the usual one.

The [Feynman slash notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feynman_slash_notation "Feynman slash notation") is an unrelated use of combining slashes, mostly seen in [quantum field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory "Quantum field theory"). This kind of combining slash takes a vector base symbol and converts it to a matrix quantity. Technically this notation is a shorthand for contracting the vector with the [Dirac gamma matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_matrix "Gamma matrix"), so ![Image 32: {\displaystyle A\!\!\!/=\gamma ^{\mu }A_{\mu }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d3148c4897693619dd00898e421778e4c1ec5879); what one gains is not only a more compact formula, but also not having to allocate a letter as the contracted index.

The slash, sometimes distinguished as "forward slash", is used in [computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing "Computing") in a number of ways, primarily as a separator among levels in a given hierarchy, for example in the path of a filesystem.

The slash is used as the [path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(computing) "Path (computing)") component separator in many [computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer "Computer") operating systems (e.g., Unix's pictures/image.png). In [Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix "Unix") and [Unix-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like "Unix-like") systems, such as [macOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS "MacOS") and [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux "Linux"), the slash is also used for the [volume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume_(computing) "Volume (computing)")[root directory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_directory "Root directory") (e.g., the initial slash in /usr/john/pictures). Confusion of the slash with the backslash ⟨\⟩ largely arises from the use of the latter as the path component separator in the widely used MS-DOS and [Microsoft Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows "Microsoft Windows") systems.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#cite_note-jed-10)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#cite_note-turton-11)

The slash is used in a similar fashion in internet [URLs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Locator "Uniform Resource Locator") (e.g., https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)).[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#cite_note-solidhart-12) Often this portion of such URLs corresponds with files on a Unix [server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_server "Computer server") with the same name, and this is where this convention for [internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet "Internet") URLs comes from.

The slash in an [IP address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address "IP address") (e.g., 192.0.2.0/29) indicates the prefix size in [CIDR notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIDR_notation "CIDR notation"). The number of addresses of a [subnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subnetwork "Subnetwork") may be calculated as 2 address size − prefix size, in which the address size is 128 for [IPv6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6 "IPv6") and 32 for [IPv4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4 "IPv4"). For example, in IPv4, the prefix size/29 gives: 2 32–29 = 2 3 = 8 addresses.

The slash is used as a [division operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#Division) in most [programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language "Programming language") while [APL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_(programming_language) "APL (programming language)") uses it for reduction ([fold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fold_(higher-order_function) "Fold (higher-order function)")) and compression ([filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_(higher-order_function) "Filter (higher-order function)")). The double slash is used by [Rexx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rexx "Rexx") as a [modulo operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#Mod), and [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language) "Python (programming language)") (starting in version 2.2) uses a double slash for division which rounds (using [floor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_and_ceiling_functions "Floor and ceiling functions")) to an integer. In [Raku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raku_(programming_language) "Raku (programming language)") the double slash is used as a "defined-or" alternative to **||**. A dot and slash ⟨./⟩ is used in [MATLAB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MATLAB "MATLAB") and [GNU Octave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Octave "GNU Octave") to indicate an element-by-element division of matrices.

[Comments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comment_(computer_programming) "Comment (computer programming)") that begin with **/*** (a slash and an asterisk) and end with ***/** were introduced in [PL/I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PL/I "PL/I") and subsequently adopted by [SAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAS_System "SAS System"), [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language) "C (programming language)"), Rexx, [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B "C++"), [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language) "Java (programming language)"), [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript "JavaScript"), [PHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP "PHP"), [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets "Cascading Style Sheets"), and [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language) "C Sharp (programming language)"). A double slash **//** is also used by [C99](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C99 "C99"), C++, C#, PHP, Java, [Swift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_(programming_language) "Swift (programming language)"), [Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language) "Pascal (programming language)") and JavaScript to start a single line comment.

In [SGML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SGML "SGML") and derived languages such as [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML "HTML") and [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML "XML"), a slash is used in closing tags. For example, in HTML, <b> begins a section of **bold** text and </b> closes it. In XHTML, slashes are also necessary for "self-closing" elements such as the [newline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline "Newline") command <br /> where HTML has simply <br>.

In a style originating in the [Digital Equipment Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation "Digital Equipment Corporation") line of operating systems ([OS/8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS/8 "OS/8"), [RT-11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RT-11 "RT-11"), [TOPS-10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOPS-10 "TOPS-10"), et cetera), [Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_(operating_system) "Windows (operating system)"), [DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS "DOS"), some [CP/M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP/M "CP/M") programs, [OpenVMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenVMS "OpenVMS"), and [OS/2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS/2 "OS/2") all use the slash to indicate [command-line options](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_option "Command-line option"). For example, the command dir/w is understood as using the command [dir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dir_(command) "Dir (command)") ("directory") with the "wide" option. No space is required between the command and the switch; this was the reason for the choice to use backslashes as the path separator since one would otherwise be unable to run a program in a different directory.

Slashes are used as the standard delimiters for [regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression "Regular expression"), although other characters can be used instead.

[IBM JCL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_JCL "IBM JCL") uses a double slash to start each line in a batch job stream except for /* and /&.

[IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat "Internet Relay Chat") and many in-game chat clients use the slash to mark commands, such as joining and leaving a chat room or sending private messages. For example, in IRC, /join #services is a command to join the [channel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRC_channels "IRC channels") "services" and /me is a command to format the following message as though it were an action instead of a spoken message. In _[Minecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft "Minecraft")_'s chat function, the slash is used for executing console and plugin commands. In _[Second Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second\_Life "Second Life")_'s chat function, the slash is used to select the "communications channel", allowing users to direct commands to virtual objects "listening" on different channels. For example, if a virtual house's lights were set to use channel 42, the command "/42 on" would turn them on. In [Discord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discord_(software) "Discord (software)"), slash commands are used to send special messages and execute commands, like sending a [shrug emoji (¯\_(ツ)_/¯)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrug "Shrug") or a table flip emoji ((╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻), or changing one's nickname using "/nick". Slash commands can also be used to use Discord bots.

The [Gedcom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gedcom "Gedcom") standard for exchanging computerized genealogical data uses slashes to delimit surnames; an example would be Bill /Smith/ Jr. Slashes around surnames are also used in [Personal Ancestral File](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_Ancestral_File "Personal Ancestral File").

A leading slash is one of several common conventions for indicating an [active-low](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active-low#Active_state "Active-low") digital signal, which performs the named function when at a low voltage level.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#cite_note-28) For example, [dynamic random-access memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_random-access_memory "Dynamic random-access memory") has active-low Chip Select, Row Address Strobe and Column Address Strobe signals, commonly written /CS, /RAS, and /CAS.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#cite_note-29) This extends to signals which select between two options, such as "R/W", which indicates that the function is "read" when high and "write" when low. (Sometimes written as R/W for greater clarity.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#cite_note-30)

[![Image 33](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/038_35_Kisoro%2C_2000_constructed_under_swTws_Project_%287928190604%29.jpg/250px-038_35_Kisoro%2C_2000_constructed_under_swTws_Project_%287928190604%29.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:038_35_Kisoro,_2000_constructed_under_swTws_Project_(7928190604).jpg)

Sign in [Kisoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kisoro "Kisoro") with prices in [Ugandan shillings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ugandan_shilling "Ugandan shilling"); note the use of the '/=' notation.

The slash (as the "shilling mark" or "solidus")[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#cite_note-Fowler_solidus-31) was an abbreviation for the [shilling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shilling "Shilling"), a former [coin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coin "Coin") of the United Kingdom and [its former colonies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations "Commonwealth of Nations"). Before the [decimalisation of currency in Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_Day "Decimal Day"), its currency abbreviations (collectively [£sd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C2%A3sd "£sd")) represented their [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin "Latin") names, derived from a [medieval French modification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_livre "French livre") of the late [Roman libra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Roman_units_of_measurement#Mass_and_coins "Ancient Roman units of measurement"), [solidus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidus_(coin) "Solidus (coin)"), and [denarius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denarius "Denarius").[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#cite_note-32) Thus, one [penny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penny "Penny") less than two [pounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling "Pound sterling") was written £1 19s 11d or £1 19ſ 11d. During the period when [English orthography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_orthography "English orthography") included the [long s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_s "Long s"), ſ or _ſ_, (abbreviating _shilling_) the ſ came to be written as a single slash.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#cite_note-33)[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#cite_note-34) The d. might be omitted, and "2ſ6" ("two shillings and sixpence") became simplified as 2/6.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#cite_note-Fowler_solidus-31) Amounts in full pounds, shillings and pence could be written in many different ways, for example: £1 9s 6d, £1.9.6, £1-9-6, and even £1/9/6d (with a slash used _also_ to separate pounds and shillings).[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#cite_note-35) The same style was also used under the [British Raj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Raj "British Raj") and early independent India for the predecimalization [rupee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee "Indian rupee")/[anna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_anna "Indian anna")/[pie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_pie "Indian pie") system.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#cite_note-36)

In five East African countries ([Kenya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya "Kenya"), [Tanzania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanzania "Tanzania"), [Uganda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uganda "Uganda"), [Somalia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somalia "Somalia"), and the _de facto_ country of [Somaliland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somaliland "Somaliland")), where the national currencies are denominated in shillings, the [decimal separator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_separator "Decimal separator") is a slash mark (e.g., 2/50). Where the minor unit is zero, an [equals sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equals_sign "Equals sign") is used (e.g., 5/=).

Slashes are a common [calendar date](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar_date "Calendar date") separator[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#cite_note-solidhart-12) used [across many countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Date_format_by_country "Date format by country") and by some standards such as the [Common Log Format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Log_Format "Common Log Format") used by web servers. Depending on context, it may be in the form Day/Month/Year, Month/Day/Year, or Year/Month/Day. If only two elements are present, they typically denote a day and month in some order. For example, [9/11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9/11 "9/11") is a common American way of writing the date 11 September; Britons write this as 11/9. Owing to the ambiguity across cultures, the practice of using only two elements to denote a date is sometimes proscribed.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#cite_note-37)

Because of the world's many varying [conventional date and time formats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Date_and_time_notation_by_country "Date and time notation by country"), [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601 "ISO 8601") advocates the use of a Year-Month-Day system separated by hyphens (e.g., [Victory in Europe Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victory_in_Europe_Day "Victory in Europe Day") occurred on 1945-05-08). In the ISO 8601 system, slashes represent date ranges: "1939/1945" represents what is more commonly written in [Anglophone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglophone "Anglophone") countries as "1939–1945". The autumn term of a northern-hemisphere school year might be marked "2010-09-01/12-22".

In English, a range marked by a slash often has a separate meaning from one marked by a dash or hyphen.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#cite_note-solidhart-12) "24/25 December" would mark the time shared by both days (i.e., the night from [Christmas Eve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Eve "Christmas Eve") to [Christmas morning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Day "Christmas Day")) rather than the time made up by both days together, which would be written "24–25 December". Similarly, a historical reference to "1066/67" might imply an event occurred during the winter of late 1066 and early 1067,[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#cite_note-38) whereas a reference to 1066–67 would cover the entirety of both years. The usage was particularly common in British English during [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II"), where such slash dates were used for [night-bombing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night-bombing "Night-bombing")[air raids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_bombing "Strategic bombing"). It is also used by some police forces in the United States.

The slash is used in numbering to note totals. For example, "page 17/35" indicates that the relevant passage is on the 17th page of a 35-page document. Similarly, the marking "#333/500" on a product indicates it is the 333rd out of 500 identical products or out of a batch of 500 such products. For scores on schoolwork, in games, and so on, "85/100" indicates 85 points were attained out of a possible 100.

Slashes are also sometimes used to mark ranges in numbers that already include hyphens or dashes. One example is the [ISO treatment of dating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#Dating). Another is the [US Air Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Air_Force "US Air Force")'s treatment of aircraft serial numbers, which are normally written to note the fiscal year and aircraft number. For example, "85-1000" notes the thousandth aircraft ordered in fiscal year 1985. To indicate the next fifty subsequent aircraft, a slash is used in place of a hyphen or dash: "85-1001/1050".

### Linguistic transcription

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Slash_(punctuation)&action=edit&section=23 "Edit section: Linguistic transcription")]

A pair of slashes (as "[slants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#slants)") are used in the [transcription](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(linguistics) "Transcription (linguistics)") of [speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech "Speech") to enclose [pronunciations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pronunciation "Pronunciation") (i.e., [phonetic transcriptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonetic_transcription "Phonetic transcription")). For example, the [IPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet "International Phonetic Alphabet") transcription of the English pronunciation of "solidus" is written /ˈsɒlɪdəs/.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#cite_note-oedsolid-6) Properly, slashes mark [broad or phonemic transcriptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonemic_transcription "Phonemic transcription"), whereas narrow, [allophonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allophone "Allophone") transcriptions are enclosed by [square brackets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_bracket "Square bracket"). For example, the word _little_ may be broadly rendered as /ˈlɪtəl/ but a careful transcription of the [velarization of the second L](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_L "Dark L") would be written [ˈlɪɾɫ̩].

In [sociolinguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociolinguistics "Sociolinguistics"), a double or triple slash may also be used in the transcription of a [traditional sociolinguistic interview](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociolinguistics#Sociolinguistic_interview "Sociolinguistics") or in other type of linguistic elicitation to represent simultaneous speech, interruptions, and certain types of [speech disfluencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_disfluencies "Speech disfluencies").

Single and double slashes are often used as typographic substitutes for the [click letters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Click_letter "Click letter")[ǀ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C7%80 "ǀ"), [ǁ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C7%81 "ǁ").

A [diaphonemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaphoneme "Diaphoneme") transcription may be marked in several ways, e.g. with a pair of slash marks (⫽◌⫽).

The slash is used in various [scansion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scansion "Scansion") notations for representing the metrical pattern of a line of verse, typically to indicate a stressed syllable.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

The slash (as a "virgule") offset by spaces to either side is used to mark [line breaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_(poetry) "Line (poetry)") when transcribing text from a multi-line format into a single-line one.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#cite_note-solidhart-12)[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#cite_note-39) It is particularly common in quoting [poetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poetry "Poetry"), [song lyrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyrics "Lyrics"), and [dramatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama "Drama") scripts, formats where omitting the line breaks risks losing meaningful context. For example, here is a part of [Hamlet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamlet "Hamlet")'s [soliloquy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soliloquy "Soliloquy"):

> [To be, or not to be](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_be,_or_not_to_be "To be, or not to be"), that is the question:
> 
>  Whether 'tis Nobler in the mind to suffer
> 
>  The Slings and Arrows of outrageous Fortune,
> 
>  Or to take Arms against a Sea of troubles,
> 
>  And by opposing end them...

— _[Hamlet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamlet "Hamlet")_, Act II, Scene ii[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#cite_note-40)

[_[full citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing\_sources#What\_information\_to\_include "Wikipedia:Citing sources")_]

If someone wanted to quote the above [soliloquy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soliloquy "Soliloquy") in a prose paragraph, it is standard to mark the line breaks as follows: "To be, or not to be, that is the question: / Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer / The slings and arrows of outrageous [Fortune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_(goddess) "Fortune (goddess)"), / Or to take arms against a sea of troubles, / And by opposing end them..." Less often, virgules are used in marking [paragraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paragraph "Paragraph") breaks when quoting a [prose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prose "Prose") passage. Some style guides, such as _[New Hart's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New\_Hart%27s\_Rules "New Hart's Rules")_, prefer to use a pipe | in place of the slash to mark these line and paragraph breaks.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#cite_note-solidhart-12)

The virgule may be thinner than a standard slash when typeset. In computing contexts, it may be necessary to use a [non-breaking space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-breaking_space "Non-breaking space") before the virgule to prevent it from being [widowed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widows_and_orphans "Widows and orphans") on the next line.

The slash has become standard in several abbreviations. Generally, it is used to mark two-letter [initialisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initialism "Initialism") such as A/C (short for "air conditioner"), w/o ("without"), b/w ("black and white" or, less often, "between"), w/e ("whatever" or, less often, "weekend" or "week ending"), i/o ("[input/output](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output "Input/output")"), r/w ("read/write"), and n/a ("not applicable" or, in aviation, "not authorized"). Other initialisms employing the slash include w/ ("with") and w/r/t ("with regard to"). Such slashed abbreviations are somewhat more common in British English and were more common around the [Second World War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War "Second World War") (as with "S/E" to mean "single-engined"). The abbreviation 24/7 (denoting 24 hours a day, 7 days a week) describes a business that is always open or unceasing activity.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#cite_note-solidhart-12)

The slash in [derived units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derived_unit "Derived unit") such as m/s (meters per second) is not an abbreviation slash, but a straight division. It is however in that position read as 'per' rather than e.g. 'over', which can be seen as analogous to units whose symbols are pure abbreviations such as mph (miles per hour), although in abbreviations 'per' is 'p' or dropped entirely (psi, pounds per square inch) rather than a slash.

In the [US government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_United_States "Government of the United States"), the names of offices within various departments are abbreviated using slashes, starting with the larger office and following with its subdivisions. For example, the [Federal Aviation Administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration "Federal Aviation Administration")'s [Office of Commercial Space Transportation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Commercial_Space_Transportation "Office of Commercial Space Transportation") is formally abbreviated FAA/AST.

The slash or vertical bar (as a "[separatrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#separatrix)") is used in [proofreading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proofreading "Proofreading") to mark the end of [margin notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginalia "Marginalia")[[c]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#cite_note-42) or to separate margin notes from one another. The slash is also sometimes used in various proofreading [initialisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#Abbreviation), such as l/c and u/c for changes to [lower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_case "Lower case") and [upper case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_case "Upper case"), respectively.

### Business correspondence

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Slash_(punctuation)&action=edit&section=28 "Edit section: Business correspondence")]

In formal business correspondence, when a letter is typed by someone other than the person responsible for its contents, it is standard to add a suffix with the initials of the author (in upper-case), and typist (in lower-case) after the signature block, separated by a slash. For example, a letter typed by D.E. at the direction of A.B.C. would include the line "ABC/de".[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#cite_note-43)

The slash is used in [fan fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan_fiction "Fan fiction") to mark the [romantic pairing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_attraction "Sexual attraction") a piece will focus upon (e.g., a K/S denoted a _[Star Trek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star\_Trek "Star Trek")_ story would focus on a sexual relationship between [Kirk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_T._Kirk "James T. Kirk") and [Spock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spock "Spock")), a usage which developed in the 1970s from the earlier friendship pairings marked by [ampersands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampersand "Ampersand") (e.g., K&S). The genre as a whole is now known as [slash fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_fiction "Slash fiction"). Because it is more generally associated with [homosexual male](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male_homosexuality "Male homosexuality") relationships, lesbian slash fiction is sometimes distinguished as [femslash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femslash "Femslash"). In situations where other pairings occur, the genres may be distinguished as m/m, f/f, and so on.

The slash is used under the [Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AACR2 "AACR2") to separate the title of a work from its statement of responsibility (i.e., the listing of its author, director, etc.). Like a [line break](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#Line_breaks), this slash is surrounded by a single space on either side. For example:

*   Gone with the Wind / by Margaret Mitchell.
*   Star Trek II. The Wrath of Khan [videorecording] / Paramount Pictures.

The format is used in both [card catalogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_catalog "Card catalog") and online records.

The slash is sometimes used as an abbreviation for building numbers. For example, in some contexts,[_[where?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Naming\_conventions\_(geographic\_names) "Wikipedia:Naming conventions (geographic names)")_] 8/A Evergreen Gardens specifies Apartment 8 in Building A of the residential complex Evergreen Gardens. In the United States, however, such an address refers to the first division of Apartment 8 and is simply a variant of Apartment 8A or 8-A. Similarly in the United Kingdom, an address such as 12/2 Anywhere Road means flat (or apartment) 2 in the building numbered 12 on Anywhere Road.

The slash is also used in the United States in the postal abbreviation for "care of." For example, Judy Smith c/o Bob Smith could be used when Bob Smith is receiving mail on Judy's behalf. Typically, this would be used in a situation where someone is either out of town, in an institution or hotel, or temporarily staying at another's address.

In Spanish address writings, "c/" is used as the abbreviation of "calle" (or "carrer" in Catalan) meaning "street".

Slashes are used in [musical notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_notation "Musical notation") as an alternative to writing out specific [notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_note "Musical note") where it is easier to read than traditional notation or where the player can [improvise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improvisation "Improvisation"). They are commonly used to indicate [chords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_(music) "Chord (music)") either in place of or in combination with traditional notation, notably in the form of [slash chords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_chord "Slash chord"). For [drummers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drummer "Drummer"), they find use as an indication to continue with a previously indicated style.

A slash is used to mark a [spare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spare_(bowling) "Spare (bowling)") (knocking down all ten pins in two throws) when scoring [ten-pin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten-pin_bowling "Ten-pin bowling") and [duckpin bowling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duckpin_bowling "Duckpin bowling").[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#cite_note-44)

In online messaging, a slash might be used to imitate the formatting of a chat command (e.g., writing "/fliptable" as though there were such a command) or the closing tags of languages such as HTML (e.g., writing "/endrant" to end a diatribe or "/s" to mark the preceding text as [sarcastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcasm "Sarcasm")). A pair of slashes is sometimes used as a way to mark [italic text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italics "Italics"), where no special formatting is available (e.g., /italics/).[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

### Before an e-signature

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Slash_(punctuation)&action=edit&section=35 "Edit section: Before an e-signature")]

In legal writing, especially in a pleading, attorneys often sign their name with an "s" that is either enclosed by two slashes or followed by a single slash and preceding the attorney's name.[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#cite_note-45) An example would be the following:

> /s/ Bob Smith
> 
> Attorney for Plaintiff

The [Iraqw language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraqw_language "Iraqw language") of Tanzania uses the slash as a letter, representing the [voiced pharyngeal fricative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiced_pharyngeal_fricative "Voiced pharyngeal fricative"), as in [/ameeni](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki//ameeni "wikt:/ameeni"), "woman".[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#cite_note-46)

There are usually no spaces either before or after a slash. According to _[New Hart's Rules: The Oxford Style Guide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New\_Hart%27s\_Rules:\_The\_Oxford\_Style\_Guide "New Hart's Rules: The Oxford Style Guide")_, a slash is usually written without spacing on either side when it connects single words, letters or symbols.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#cite_note-solidhart-12) Exceptions are in [representing the start of a new line when quoting verse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#Poetry), or a new paragraph when quoting prose. _[The Chicago Manual of Style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Chicago\_Manual\_of\_Style "The Chicago Manual of Style")_ also allows spaces when either of the separated items is a compound that itself includes a space: "Our New Zealand / Western Australia trip".[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#cite_note-47) (Compare [use of an en dash used to separate such compounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dash#Attributive_compounds "Dash").) _The Canadian Style: A Guide to Writing and Editing_ prescribes: "No space before or after an oblique when used between individual words, letters or symbols; one space before and after the oblique when used between longer groups which contain internal spacing", giving the examples "n/a" and "Language and Society / _Langue et société_".[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#cite_note-48)

According to _The Chicago Manual of Style_, when typesetting a URL or computer path, line breaks should occur before a slash but not in the text between two slashes.[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#cite_note-49)

[![Image 34](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Big_solidus_in_folder_name_compared_with_slash_in_text.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Big_solidus_in_folder_name_compared_with_slash_in_text.png)

Though the "ASCII slash" is a [reserved character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserved_character "Reserved character") that is prohibited in Windows file and folder names, the **big solidus** is permitted (first box above). In this context, it is very similar to the slash (second box).

As a very common character, the slash (as "slant") was originally encoded in [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII "ASCII") with the decimal code 47 or [0x](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal "Hexadecimal")2F.[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#cite_note-rfc20-50) The same value was used in [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode "Unicode"), which calls it "solidus" and also adds some more characters:

[![Image 35](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/123_fraction_slash_456.svg/250px-123_fraction_slash_456.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:123_fraction_slash_456.svg)

A fraction automatically generated by the font from basic digits and the Unicode fraction bar, 123⁄456.

FRACTION SLASH is supposed to reformat the preceding and succeeding digits as numerator and denominator glyphs (e.g., display of "1, FRACTION SLASH, 2" as "½", and similarly "123, FRACTION SLASH, 456" as 123⁄456).[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#cite_note-52) This is supported by an increasing number of environments and [computer fonts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_font "Computer font"). Because support is not yet universal (this browser, for instance, renders "123⁄456"), some authors still use [Unicode subscripts and superscripts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_subscripts_and_superscripts#Uses "Unicode subscripts and superscripts") to compose fractions, and many computer fonts design these characters for this purpose. In addition, [precomposed fractions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precomposed_character "Precomposed character") of the multiples less than 1 of 1/n for 2 ≤ n ≤ 6 and n = 8 (e.g. ⅔ and ⅝, as well as ⅐, ⅑, and ⅒, are found in the Unicode [Number Forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_Forms "Number Forms") or [Latin-1 Supplement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin-1_Supplement_(Unicode_block) "Latin-1 Supplement (Unicode block)") blocks.[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#cite_note-53)

When used as a fraction bar, this form of the mark is less vertical than an ASCII slash, generally close to 45° and [kerned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerning "Kerning") on both sides;[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#cite_note-bringhurst-56) this use is distinguished by Unicode as the fraction slash.[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#cite_note-uni8-54) (This use is sometimes mistakenly described as the _sole_ meaning of "solidus", with its use as a shilling mark and slash distinguished under the name "virgule".[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#cite_note-bringhurst-56)[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#cite_note-designorati-57)) |
