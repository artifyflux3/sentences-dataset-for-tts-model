306 – 373 ), also known as Ephraem the Deacon , Ephrem of Edessa or Aprem of Nisibis , (Syriac: ܡܪܝ ܐܦܪܝܡ ܣܘܪܝܝܐ — Mâr Aphrêm Sûryâyâ) was a prominent Christian theologian and writer who is revered as one of the most notable hymnographers of Eastern Christianity . He was born in Nisibis , served as a deacon and later lived in Edessa .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Ephrem is venerated as a saint by all traditional Churches. He is especially revered in Syriac Christianity , both in East Syriac tradition and West Syriac tradition , and also counted as a Holy and Venerable Father (i.e., a sainted monk) in the Eastern Orthodox Church , especially in the Slovak tradition. He was declared a Doctor of the Church in the Catholic Church in 1920. Ephrem is also credited as the founder of the School of Nisibis , which in later centuries was the center of learning for the Church of the East .

Ephrem wrote a wide variety of hymns, poems, and sermons in verse, as well as prose exegesis . These were works of practical theology for the edification of the Church in troubled times. His performance practice of all-women choirs singing his madrāšê (teaching hymns) was particularly notable, and from it emerged the Syriac Christian tradition of "deaconess" choir members. Ephrem's works were so popular that, for centuries after his death, Christian authors wrote hundreds of pseudepigraphal works in his name. He has been called the most significant of all the fathers of the Syriac -speaking church tradition, the next most famous after him being Jacob of Serugh and Narsai .

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] Life [ edit ] Ephrem was born around the year 306 in the city of Nisibis (modern Nusaybin , Turkey ), in the Roman province of Mesopotamia , that was recently acquired by the Roman Empire .

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] Internal evidence from Ephrem's hymnody suggests that both his parents were part of the growing Christian community in the city, although later hagiographers wrote that his father was a pagan priest.

[ 9 ] In those days, religious culture in the region of Nisibis included local polytheism , Judaism and several varieties of the Early Christianity . Most of the population spoke the Aramaic language , while Greek and Latin were languages of administration. The city had a complex ethnic composition, consisting of "Assyrians, Arabs, Greeks, Jews, Parthians, Romans, and Iranians".

[ 10 ] Newly excavated Church of Saint Jacob of Nisibis , where Ephrem taught and ministered The interior of the Church of Saint Jacob in Nisibis Jacob , the second bishop of Nisibis, [ 11 ] was appointed in 308, and Ephrem grew up under his leadership of the community. Jacob of Nisibis is recorded as a signatory at the First Council of Nicea in 325. Ephrem was baptized as a youth and almost certainly became a son of the covenant , an unusual form of Assyrian proto- monasticism . Jacob appointed Ephrem as a teacher (Syriac malp̄ānâ , a title that still carries great respect for Syriac Christians). He was ordained as a deacon either at his baptism or later.

[ 12 ] He began to compose hymns and write biblical commentaries as part of his educational office. In his hymns, he sometimes refers to himself as a "herdsman" ( ܥܠܢܐ , ' allānâ ), to his bishop as the "shepherd" ( ܪܥܝܐ , rā'yâ ), and to his community as a 'fold' ( ܕܝܪܐ , dayrâ ). Ephrem is popularly credited as the founder of the School of Nisibis , which, in later centuries, was the centre of learning of the Church of the East .

[ 13 ] In 337, Emperor Constantine I , who had legalised and promoted the practice of Christianity in the Roman Empire, died. Seizing on this opportunity, Shapur II of Persia began a series of attacks into Roman North Mesopotamia . Nisibis was besieged in 338, 346 and 350. During the first siege, Ephrem credits Bishop Jacob as defending the city with his prayers. In the third siege, of 350, Shapur rerouted the River Mygdonius to undermine the walls of Nisibis. The Nisibenes quickly repaired the walls while the Persian elephant cavalry became bogged down in the wet ground. Ephrem celebrated what he saw as the miraculous salvation of the city in a hymn that portrayed Nisibis as being like Noah's Ark , floating to safety on the flood.

[ citation needed ] One important physical link to Ephrem's lifetime is the baptistery of Nisibis. The inscription tells that it was constructed under Bishop Vologeses in 359. In that year, Shapur attacked again. The cities around Nisibis were destroyed one by one, and their citizens killed or deported.

Constantius II was unable to respond; the campaign of Julian in 363 ended with his death in battle. His army elected Jovian as the new emperor, and to rescue his army, he was forced to surrender Nisibis to Persia (also in 363) and to permit the expulsion of the entire Christian population.

[ 14 ] Ephrem declined being ordained a bishop by feigning madness , because he regarded himself unworthy for it.

[ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] Ephrem, with the others, went first to Amida ( Diyarbakır ), eventually settling in Edessa (Urhay, in Aramaic) in 363.

[ 18 ] Ephrem, in his late fifties, applied himself to ministry in his new church and seems to have continued his work as a teacher, perhaps in the School of Edessa .

Edessa had been an important center of the Aramaic-speaking world, and the birthplace of a specific Middle Aramaic dialect that came to be known as the Syriac language .

[ 19 ] The city was rich with rivaling philosophies and religions. Ephrem comments that orthodox Nicene Christians were simply called "Palutians" in Edessa, after a former bishop.

Arians , Marcionites , Manichees , Bardaisanites and various gnostic sects proclaimed themselves as the true church. In this confusion, Ephrem wrote a great number of hymns defending Nicene orthodoxy. A later Syriac writer, Jacob of Serugh , wrote that Ephrem rehearsed all-female choirs to sing his hymns set to Syriac folk tunes in the forum of Edessa. In 370 he visited Basil the Great at Caesarea, and then journeyed to the monks of Egypt. As he preached a panegyric on St. Basil, who died in 379, his own death must be placed at a later date.

[ clarification needed ] After a ten-year residency in Edessa, in his sixties, Ephrem succumbed to the plague as he ministered to its victims. He died in 373.

[ 20 ] [ 21 ] Writings and authorship [ edit ] Ephrem wrote exclusively in his native Aramaic language , using the local Edessan ( Urhaya ) dialect, that later came to be known as the Classical Syriac .

Chester Beatty Library Manuscripts [ edit ] According to the Catalogues of Syriac Manuscripts in the British Library published by Forshall & Rosen (1839) and Wright (1870–72), there are "ninety or so manuscripts which contain works by or attributed to Ephraem."

Hymns [ edit ] Over four hundred hymns attributed to Ephrem still exist.

[ according to whom?

] Granted that some have been lost, Ephrem's productivity is not in doubt.

[ according to whom?

] The church historian Sozomen credits Ephrem with having written three million verses.

[ 23 ] Ephrem combines in his writing a threefold heritage: he draws on the models and methods of early Rabbinic Judaism , he engages skillfully with Greek science and philosophy, and he delights in the Mesopotamian/Persian tradition of mystery symbolism.

[ 24 ] The most important of his works are his lyric, teaching hymns (ܡܕܖ̈ܫܐ, madrāšê ). These hymns are full of rich, poetic imagery drawn from biblical sources, folk tradition, and other religions and philosophies. The madrāšê are written in stanzas of syllabic verse and employ over fifty different metrical schemes. The form is defined by an antiphon , or congregational refrain (ܥܘܢܝܬܐ, ' ûnîṯâ ), between each independent strophe (or verse), and the refrain's melody mimics that of the opening half of the strophe.

[ 25 ] Each madrāšâ had its qālâ (ܩܠܐ), a traditional tune identified by its opening line. All of these qālê are now lost. It seems that Bardaisan and Mani composed madrāšê , and Ephrem felt that the medium was a suitable tool to use against their claims.

[ 25 ] Saints Ephrem (right) George (top) and John Damascene on a 14th-century triptych The madrāšê are gathered into various hymn cycles. In the CSCO critical edition of Beck et al. (1955–1975), these have been given standardised names and abbreviations.

[ 26 ] By the year 2000, English translations had been published for the following: [ 27 ] 52 hymns On Virginity [ 27 ] 28 hymns On the Nativity [ 27 ] 15 hymns On Paradise [ 27 ] 4 hymns Against [Emperor Caesar] Julian [ 27 ] Carmina Nisibena or On Nisibis [ 27 ] On the Church [ 27 ] On Lent [ 27 ] On the Paschal Season [ 27 ] Against Heresies [ 27 ] Some of these titles do not do justice to the entirety of the collection (for instance, only the first half of the Carmina Nisibena is about Nisibis).

[ citation needed ] Bates (2000) remarked: "[Various] collections of Ephrem's hymns [...] appear to be randomly assembled by later editors and named for the subject of the first hymn in the collection only".

[ 27 ] Particularly influential were his Hymns Against Heresies .

[ 28 ] Ephrem used these to warn his flock of the heresies that threatened to divide the early church. He lamented that the faithful were "tossed to and fro and carried around with every wind of doctrine, by the cunning of men, by their craftiness and deceitful wiles" (Eph 4:14).

[ 29 ] He devised hymns laden with doctrinal details to inoculate right-thinking Christians against heresies such as docetism . The Hymns Against Heresies employ colourful metaphors to describe the Incarnation of Christ as fully human and divine. Ephrem asserts that Christ's unity of humanity and divinity represents peace, perfection and salvation; in contrast, docetism and other heresies sought to divide or reduce Christ's nature and, in doing so, rend and devalue Christ's followers with their false teachings.

[ citation needed ] Authenticity of hymns On Epiphany [ edit ] The most complete, critical text of writings attributed to Ephrem was compiled between 1955 and 1979 by Dom Edmund Beck, OSB, as part of the Corpus Scriptorum Christianorum Orientalium (CSCO).

[ 30 ] Beck's 1959 critical edition of the madrashe (hymns) and mêmrê (homilies) attributed to Ephrem led to much scholarly debate on the authenticity of the madrashe known as On Epiphany , as Ephrem was certainly not familiar with Epiphany as a feast celebrating Jesus' baptism on 6 January .

[ 30 ] Unlike in Europe, where the Nativity of Jesus was celebrated on 25 December, but the baptism of Jesus would evolve into a separate feast called "Epiphany" on 6 January, there was only one Christian feast celebrated in winter in the time and place where Ephrem lived, namely the Nativity on 6 January, when baptism was also performed.

[ 31 ] A 1956 paper written by Beck himself therefore warned researchers not to base their reconstructions of Ephrem's baptismal theology on the contents of these madrashe, given the fact that many of the hymns presuppose that Epiphany and Nativity were two separate feasts celebrated two weeks apart, thereby challenging Ephrem's authorship.

[ 32 ] While the oldest surviving manuscripts of Ephrem's hymns date to the 6th century and contain hymns on the Nativity that Beck thought were certainly authentic, the contested hymns On Epiphany are missing from them.

[ 31 ] They do not appear in manuscripts until much later, in the 9th century, suggesting that they were interpolated .

[ 31 ] Scholars have largely accepted Beck's arguments that the collection as a whole was established after the 4th century, and that some hymns in them were not written by Ephrem, or at least not in the form that they have been preserved in, but that other hymns should nevertheless be considered authentic.

[ 33 ] Performance practices and gender [ edit ] Ephrem the Syriac in a 16th-century Russian illustration The relationship between Ephrem's compositions and femininity is shown again in documentation suggesting that the madrāšê were sung by all-women choirs with an accompanying lyre. These women's choirs were composed of members of the Daughters of the Covenant, an important institution in historical Syriac Christianity , but they weren't always labeled as such.

[ 34 ] Ephrem, like many Syriac liturgical poets, believed that women's voices were important to hear in the church as they were modeled after Mary, mother of Jesus, whose acceptance of God's call led to salvation for all through the birth of Jesus.

[ 35 ] One variety of the madrāšê, the soghyatha , was sung in a conversational style between male and female choirs.

[ 35 ] The women's choir would sing the role of biblical women, and the men's choir would sing the male role. Through the role of singing Ephrem's madrāšê, women's choirs were granted a role in worship.

[ 34 ] Further writings [ edit ] Ephrem also wrote verse homilies ( ܡܐܡܖ̈ܐ , mêmrê ). These sermons in poetry are far fewer in number than the madrāšê. The mêmrê were written in heptasyllabic couplets (pairs of lines of seven syllables each).

[ citation needed ] The third category of Ephrem's writings is his prose work. He wrote a biblical commentary on the Diatessaron (the single gospel harmony of the early Syriac church), the Syriac original of which was found in 1957. His Commentary on Genesis and Exodus is an exegesis of Genesis and Exodus . Some fragments exist in Armenian of his commentaries on the Acts of the Apostles and Pauline Epistles .

[ citation needed ] He also wrote refutations against Bardaisan , Mani , Marcion and others.

[ 36 ] [ 37 ] Symbols and metaphors [ edit ] Ephrem's writings contain a rich variety of symbols and metaphors. Christopher Buck gives a summary of analysis of a selection of six key scenarios (the way, robe of glory, sons and daughters of the Covenant , wedding feast, harrowing of hell , Noah's Ark /Mariner) and six root metaphors (physician, medicine of life, mirror, pearl, Tree of life , paradise ).

[ 38 ] Selected works [ edit ] Boasting an extensive corpus, Ephrem's poems, hymns, prayers and prose has been incorporated deeply into every facet of the Syriac tradition, from the Liturgy of the Hours ( Shehimo ) to Divine Liturgy . The following is a bedtime prayer, found in the Compline of the Shehimo for some weekdays.

Syriac Orthodox icon of Mor Ephrem Portrait of Ephrem Lord have mercy upon us, kindly accept our service Sending from Thy treasu-ry, kindness, mercy – and pardon.

Grant me Oh Lord, while I stand, keeping vigil before Thee Should I fall to slumber’s hand, guard thou me from – sinful sleep.

Father, Son and Holy Ghost; who is the One and true God.

[ 39 ] Pseudepigraphy and misattributions [ edit ] Ephrem's meditations on the symbols of Christian faith and his stand against heresy made him a popular source of inspiration throughout the church. There is a huge corpus of Ephrem pseudepigraphy and legendary hagiography in many languages. Some of these compositions are in verse, often mimicking Ephrem's heptasyllabic couplets.

[ citation needed ] Syriac churches still use many of Ephrem's hymns as part of the annual cycle of worship. However, most of these liturgical hymns are edited and conflated versions of the originals.

[ citation needed ] Another one of the works attributed to Ephrem was the Cave of Treasures , written in Syriac, but by a much later, unknown author, who lived at the end of the 6th and the beginning of the 7th century.

[ 40 ] Greek Ephrem [ edit ] "It is a mark of Ephraem's enormous reputation that such an extensive corpus of works in Greek was gathered under his name. Where no Syriac original has survived, the question of authenticity arises. (...) The Greek works may not be so much translations as adaptations in the spirit of Ephraem using his favourite images. A widely held judgment is that the corpus is 'sporadically authentic'." – T.S. Pattie (1990) [ 41 ] There is a very large number of works by "Ephrem" extant in Greek. In the literature this material is often referred to as "Greek Ephrem", or Ephraem Graecus ("Ephrem the Greek", as opposed to the real Ephrem the Syrian), as if it was by a single author. This is not the case, but the term is used for convenience. Some texts are in fact Greek translations of genuine works by Ephrem, but most are not.

[ 41 ] Ephrem is attributed with writing hagiographies such as The Life of Saint Mary the Harlot (extant in Greek and Latin), though this credit is called into question.

[ 42 ] The best known of these writings is the Prayer of Saint Ephrem , which is recited at every service during Great Lent and other fasting periods in Eastern Christianity .

[ 43 ] [ 44 ] There has been very little critical examination of any of these works. They were edited uncritically by Assemani, and there is also a modern Greek edition by Phrantzolas.

[ 45 ] Amongst scholars, there is a broad consensus that the Greek corpus attributed to Ephrem is only 'sporadically authentic'.

[ 41 ] Latin Ephrem and other languages [ edit ] There are also works by "Ephrem" in Latin , Slavonic and Arabic . "Ephrem Latinus" is the term given to Latin translations of "Ephrem Graecus". None is by Ephrem the Syrian. "Pseudo-Ephrem Latinus" is the name given to Latin works under the name of Ephrem which are imitations of the style of Ephrem Latinus. One example is the Apocalypse of Pseudo-Ephraem , extant in one Latin and one Syriac version.

[ citation needed ] Also attributed to Ephrem are the Parenesis or "precepts", found in the 10th-century Rila fragments and the early 13th-century Kyiv Caves Patericon , translated into Old Church Slavonic .

[ citation needed ] Veneration as a saint [ edit ] Contemporary Romanian icon (2005) Soon after Ephrem's death, legendary accounts of his life began to circulate. One of the earlier "modifications" is the statement that Ephrem's father was a pagan priest of Abnil or Abizal. However, internal evidence from his authentic writings suggest that he was raised by Christian parents.

[ 46 ] Ephrem is venerated as an example of monastic discipline in Eastern Christianity . In the Eastern Orthodox scheme of hagiography, Ephrem is counted as a Venerable Father (i.e., a sainted monk). His feast day is celebrated on 28 January and on the Saturday of the Venerable Fathers ( Cheesefare Saturday), which is the Saturday before the beginning of Great Lent .

[ 47 ] On 5 October 1920, Pope Benedict XV proclaimed Ephrem a Doctor of the Church ("Doctor of the Syrians").

[ 48 ] The most popular title for Ephrem is Harp of the Spirit (Syriac: ܟܢܪܐ ܕܪܘܚܐ , Kenārâ d-Rûḥâ ). He is also referred to as the Deacon of Edessa, the Sun of the Syrians and a Pillar of the Church.

[ 49 ] His Roman Catholic feast day of 9 June conforms to his date of death. For 48 years (1920–1969), it was on 18 June, and this date is still observed in the Extraordinary Form.

[ 50 ] Ephrem is honored with a feast day on the liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church (USA) on June 10.

[ 51 ] Ephrem is remembered in the Church of England with a commemoration on 9 June .
