It is affiliated with the Southern Baptist Conservatives of Virginia ( Southern Baptist Convention ). Founded in 1971 by Jerry Falwell Sr.

and Elmer L. Towns as Lynchburg Baptist College , Liberty is among the world's largest Christian universities and one of the largest private non-profit universities in the United States by total student enrollment.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] Liberty University consists of 17 colleges, including the Helms School of Government and the Rawlings School of Divinity.

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] Most of its enrollment is in online courses ; [ 13 ] [ 14 ] in 2020, the university enrolled about 15,000 in its residential program and 80,000 online.

[ 15 ] [ 16 ] Its high number of students can be explained in particular by its tuition fees, which are among the lowest in the United States.

[ 17 ] Liberty's athletic teams compete in Division I of the NCAA and are collectively known as the Liberty Flames . Their athletics program joined Conference USA as a full member in 2023.

[ 18 ] The university requires undergraduate students to take three Evangelical Bible-studies classes.

[ 19 ] Its honor code , called the "Liberty Way", prohibits premarital sex , cohabitation , any kind of romantic relationship between members of the same sex, [ 20 ] and alcohol use.

[ 21 ] [ 22 ] Liberty University is perceived as a "bastion of the Christian right ", playing a prominent role in Republican politics under Falwell and his son and successor Jerry Falwell Jr.

; Falwell Jr. left in 2020 amid allegations of sexual and professional impropriety and was later sued by the university.

[ 23 ] Dondi E. Costin is the current president of Liberty University.

History [ edit ] Establishment [ edit ] Jerry Falwell, evangelist and leader of the Moral Majority The school was founded as Lynchburg Baptist College [ 24 ] in 1971 by televangelist Jerry Falwell Sr.

and Elmer L. Towns . Falwell, already a pastor of Thomas Road Baptist Church , served as the first chancellor of the school. From 1979 to the late 1980s, Falwell Sr. also headed the Moral Majority , a right-wing political organization.

[ 24 ] [ 25 ] The school changed its name to Liberty Baptist College in 1976. Officials said the change aimed to distance the school from the name Lynchburg, which is often mistakenly associated with lynching ; co-founder Towns also said that Falwell Sr. wanted to use the name "Liberty" to ride the enthusiasm for the Bicentennial of the United States .

[ 26 ] The name changed again in 1984, to Liberty University . In 1985, the university launched a distance-learning program by mailing VHS tapes to students; [ 15 ] this was the forerunner to Liberty University's current online program.

[ 15 ] [ 27 ] In 1987, Liberty University's 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status was formally recognized by the IRS.

In its early decades, the university was kept afloat financially by major donors.

[ 15 ] The university was placed on probation multiple times in the 1990s by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools due to heavy debt loads.

[ 15 ] In 1990, the university's debt totaled $110 million; by 1996, this had decreased to $40 million.

[ 15 ] In 1994, Sun Myung Moon's Women's Federation for World Peace funneled $3.5 million to Liberty University.

[ 28 ] Modern history [ edit ] In 2004, Liberty University named its School of Government for Jesse Helms , a former U.S. senator from North Carolina and a Falwell family friend.

[ 29 ] In 2005, Barron 's Profiles of American Colleges ranked undergraduate admission to LU as "competitive", its fourth-highest of six ranks.

[ 30 ] [ 31 ] When high-speed Internet connections became more widespread around 2005, Liberty began to offer online courses to a larger adult population.

After Falwell Sr. died in 2007, his son Jerry Falwell Jr.

became the university's second chancellor and fourth president.

[ 25 ] At the time, the university listed $259 million in assets.

[ 32 ] Liberty University Online Academy was formed in 2007, serving 23 students.

In 2009, Liberty University withdrew official recognition of the student Young Democrats club , saying that the club's political positions, including support of abortion rights , conflicted with the school's. The school's College Republicans club remains officially recognized.

[ 33 ] In 2010, Liberty students received about $445 million in federal financial aid money, the highest total of any school in Virginia and one of the highest in the country.

[ 34 ] [ 35 ] A 56 percent increase over the previous year, the money was mostly in the form of student loans, but also included some grants and other forms of aid.

[ 34 ] In 2011, Liberty blocked campus internet access to the website of a local newspaper, the News & Advance , after it reported that the university received more federal financial aid than any other school in Virginia.

[ 34 ] [ 36 ] Falwell Jr. refused to say why the block was imposed, said it was unrelated to anything published in the newspaper, and said that the News & Advance had been blocked on campus before. The block was lifted one day after the financial-aid article was published.

[ 37 ] [ 38 ] As of 2017 [update] , the university's endowment stood at more than $1 billion and gross assets exceeded $2 billion.

[ 39 ] In November 2020, Liberty University graduate and athletics booster Bob Good won a seat in the US House of Representatives, making him the first Liberty graduate to be in the House.

[ 40 ] On March 31, 2023, Dondi Costin was named president of Liberty University.

[ 41 ] Liberty University is a member of the advisory board of Project 2025 , [ 42 ] a collection of conservative and right-wing policy proposals from the Heritage Foundation to reshape the United States federal government and consolidate executive power should the Republican nominee win the 2024 presidential election .

[ 186 ] [ 187 ] A 2021 ProPublica investigation found that "an ethos of sexual purity, as embodied by the Liberty Way, has led to school officials discouraging, dismissing and even blaming female students who have tried to come forward with claims of sexual assault." [ 188 ] The school sought for years to conceal campus crime and safety statistics, according to a preliminary 2023 report by the U.S. Department of Education reviewed by the Washington Post.

The report, whose findings may yet be appealed by the school, documents alleged violations of the Clery Act , which requires schools that receive federal money to disclose crime and safety statistics.

[ 200 ] Sexual relations are only permitted in a Biblically ordained marriage between a man and a woman. The student handbook says gay sex is prohibited by the Bible , and thus by the school.

[ 201 ] Kissing, holding hands, or dating a member of the same sex are also prohibited under The Liberty Way .

In 2019, Will Young, a former editor of the Champion , recalled his experiences in a lengthy Washington Post article. In his first week in that role, he had been rebuked for attempting to get the campus's police blotter . He found that school officials often overrode student editors' decisions and imposed censorship, which was part of "an infrastructure of thought-control that Falwell and his lieutenants [had] introduced into every aspect of Liberty University life". Young wrote that when he eventually resigned, the school did not appoint a new student editor, opting instead to turn the newspaper "into a faculty-run, student-written organ and seizing complete control of its content." [ 223 ] Student journalists became so frustrated that they launched an independent newspaper, the Lynchburg Torch , to cover stories the administration tried to suppress.

[ 223 ] [ 224 ] It operated from 2017 to 2019.

[ 225 ] Speech and debate [ edit ] Liberty's Inter-Collegiate policy debate program ranked first overall (i.e., combining the results at the varsity, junior varsity, and novice levels) for their division at the National Debate Tournament in 2006, 2007, 2009, 2010, and 2011.

[ 262 ] Subsidiaries [ edit ] Liberty University Online [ edit ] Liberty University has an Internet education component called Liberty University Online, also known as LU Online or LUO, which provides degrees from associate's level to doctorate.Liberty University offers 100% online associate degrees and bachelor's degrees, as well as certificates, in many areas of study.

Online students constitute the overwhelming majority of the university's students and revenue, "subsidizing the university" and making them "a killing", according to faculty members, despite the "steep drop-off in quality from the traditional college to the online courses." Critics have argued that the online division subsidizes campus resources, such as the ski resort and gun range, and that online enrollment is run in a boiler room fashion. Online instructors are mainly engaged in answering emails and grading rather than creating and delivering content.

[ 85 ] Liberty University Online Academy [ edit ] Established in 2007, the Liberty University Online Academy (LUOA) is a K-12 private school serving about 18,000 students for academically talented students worldwide. It is accredited by SACS (Southern Association of Schools and Colleges).

[ 19 ] Standing for Freedom Center [ edit ] In November 2019, Liberty and Charlie Kirk of Turning Point USA launched a think tank subsidiary called the Falkirk Center for Faith and Liberty.

[ 268 ] [ 269 ] The name was derived, in part, from the portmanteau combining the names of Jerry Falwell Jr. and Charlie Kirk, as well as Falwell's affinity for the film Braveheart and the Battle of Falkirk , which was depicted in the film.

[ 270 ] The think tank hired Trump attorney Jenna Ellis and Trump surrogate Sebastian Gorka as fellows and paid for political Facebook ads promoting Trump and other Republican candidates during the 2020 election campaign.

[ 271 ] In March 2021, the university renamed the organization the "Standing for Freedom Center", having chosen not to renew Kirk's contract several months earlier.

[ 272 ] In November 2021, the Standing for Freedom Center hosted former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo , author Eric Metaxas , and former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee .

[ 273 ] Publications [ edit ] The Journal of Statesmanship and Public Policy explores topics in the realms of national security, international relations, domestic policy, and political philosophy from a deeply thoughtful, ethical, and Christian perspective."

In its early years, the university was held afloat financially by major donors.

[ 15 ] In 1987, Liberty University's 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status was formally recognized by the IRS.

In the 1990s, the university was placed on probation several times by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools because of heavy debt.

[ 15 ] In 1990, the university owed $110 million; in 1996, it owed $40 million.

[ 15 ] The Unification Church was an early donor.

[ 279 ] In 1994, the university received $3.5 million through Sun Myung Moon's Women's Federation for World Peace.

[ 28 ] In 1996 News World Communications loaned $400,000 to Liberty.

[ 279 ] In 2006, the university had net assets—cash, property, investments and other holdings—of roughly $100 million.

[ 17 ] At the start of Jerry Falwell Jr.'s presidency in 2007, the university listed $259 million in assets.

[ 32 ] Five years later, in May 2012, Falwell Jr. said the total had risen to $1 billion, thanks to proceeds from its online learning program and from accelerated facility expansion.

[ 234 ] [ 17 ] In December 2010, Liberty sold $120 million in facilities bonds to finance expansion.

[ 280 ] It sold an additional $100 million in taxable bonds in January 2012 to help finance $225.2 million of planned capital projects around the campus over the next five years.

[ 281 ] The bond offering was part of Liberty University's campus transformation plan [ 282 ] which included several renovations and additions to academic buildings and student housing, as well as fund the new Jerry Falwell Library and formation of a medical school. The bonds received a rating of "AA" from Standard & Poor's and in 2013 received an upgraded rating of "Aa3" along with a "stable outlook" projection from Moody's Investors Services based on "the increasing scope of the University's activity", "its large pool of financial reserves", "uncommonly strong operating performance", and "discipline around building and maintaining reserves".

[ 283 ] [ 284 ] In March 2017, Falwell Jr. said that the university's endowment stood at more than $1 billion and gross assets are in excess of $2 billion. The U.S. Department of Education rated Liberty as having a "perfect" financial responsibility score.

[ 39 ] According to a 2018 report by The New York Times , most of Liberty University's revenue comes from taxpayer-funded sources.

[ 19 ] In 2019, Falwell Jr. was accused of using the university for his family's financial benefit.

[ 285 ] [ 286 ] [ 287 ] [ 288 ] [ 289 ] Staff members said the university has funneled tuition money into real estate investments that benefit friends and family of the Falwells, including a shopping mall owned by the university and managed by Falwell's son Trey, a university vice president.

[ 290 ] Falwell responded to the accusations by asserting that the FBI would investigate a "criminal conspiracy" in which individuals stole university property and shared it with reporters in an effort to damage his reputation.

[ 291 ] Marketing and recruitment practices [ edit ] In 2018, ProPublica and The New York Times reported that Liberty University students were sixth in terms of receiving federal aid for the year 2017. Most of Liberty University's revenue came from taxpayer-funded sources. ProPublica/ The New York Times reported that each of the university's 300 salespeople were pressured to enroll up to eight students per day. A division of 60 salespeople targeted members of the military specifically because they had greater access to federal tuition assistance. The university's salespeople were instructed to make the university appear more affordable by describing the tuition costs per credits rather than per course. The salespeople were also instructed to not inform potential students of the Christian orientation of the education; the first classes include three required Bible-studies classes. The credits for the Bible-studies classes are usually not transferable to other universities, which disincentivizes students from leaving Liberty University for other universities. According to a former employee, the university accepts any student with a grade point average above 0.5 (equivalent to a D-minus).

[ 25 ] Sponsorships [ edit ] Liberty University has sponsored NASCAR driver William Byron , also a LU student, since 2014 in a late model program run by Dale Earnhardt Jr.

[ 292 ] Liberty is in the midst of a deal with Byron and NASCAR Cup Series team Hendrick Motorsports that runs through 2026.

[ 293 ] [ 294 ] Federal funding [ edit ] In 2019, Liberty University reportedly received about $700 million in federal funding.

[ 295 ] Student loans and defaults [ edit ] Liberty University students have a lower default rate compared to the national average of graduates from all schools. However, Liberty University students have a higher rate of defaults within three years of completing their studies compared to graduates of other private, non-profit, four-year colleges.

[ 19 ] [ 214 ] Liberty University spends far less on instruction than traditional private universities, for-profit colleges and other nonprofit religious colleges.

[ 19 ] In connection with being named to a Trump administration task force on deregulating higher education, university president Falwell alluded, as an example of regulatory overreach and "micromanagement", to Obama-era regulations that govern student loan forgiveness for students who have been cheated by fraudulent colleges.

[ 267 ] [ 296 ] Politics [ edit ] Influence [ edit ] Senator Bernie Sanders delivering remarks at Liberty in September 2015 Liberty University has been described as a "stage of choice in Republican presidential politics", [ 23 ] and a "pilgrimage site for GOP candidates." [ 21 ] According to The Washington Post , Republican candidates are drawn to the university because it is viewed as a "bastion of the Christian right".

[ 23 ] Ronald Reagan 's close relationship with the university gave it significant publicity in its early years.

[ 21 ] In 1990, 41st U.S president George H. W. Bush was the first sitting U.S. president to speak at Liberty's commencement.

[ 297 ] In 1996, U.S.

Supreme Court justice Clarence Thomas gave the commencement address at Liberty University.

[ 298 ] Republican leaders Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush , Mitt Romney , Newt Gingrich , Jeb Bush , Bobby Jindal , and John McCain have visited the campus.

[ 19 ] [ 24 ] Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson spoke at the university.

[ 299 ] In 2017, President Donald Trump gave his first college commencement speech as sitting president at Liberty University.

[ 300 ] In 2019, Vice President Mike Pence gave the school's commencement address.

[ 301 ] [ 302 ] Liberty was a satellite location for CPAC 2019, hosting numerous conservative speakers on-campus.

[ 303 ] [ 304 ] In 2009, LU stopped recognizing LU's Democratic Party student group; school officials said this was because the Democratic Party platform goes against the school's conservative Christian principles.

[ 305 ] Democrats such as Ted Kennedy , Bernie Sanders , and Jesse Jackson have spoken there.

[ 21 ] [ 22 ] In 2018, former 39th U.S. president Jimmy Carter gave the commencement speech.

[ 306 ] However, Barack Obama , Joe Biden , and Hillary Clinton have rejected invitations to speak at LU.

[ 21 ] In 2021, Interim President Jerry Prevo told Scott Lamb, then the university's senior vice president for communications and public engagement, that he wanted the school to become "a more effective political player by helping to influence elections." Prevo said getting conservative candidates elected was "one of our main goals".

Politico wrote that his comments "raise new questions about the blurred line between education and politics at the university, which as a 501(c)(3) charity is not supposed to participate directly in political campaigns".

[ 307 ] 2015 concealed handguns remarks [ edit ] In a December 5, 2015, convocation speech, President Jerry Falwell Jr. encouraged the student body to obtain concealed handgun permits .

[ 308 ] Falwell discussed the attack in San Bernardino and said, "If more good people had concealed-carry permits, then we could end those Muslims before they walked in." [ 308 ] This was met with public condemnation for singling out the Muslim religion rather than the attack itself. Governor Terry McAuliffe called the statement "repugnant". Falwell later said he was referring to the Muslim shooters in the San Bernardino attack, not all Muslims.

[ 308 ] [ 309 ] Links to Donald Trump [ edit ] President Donald Trump speaks at Liberty University Commencement Ceremony Donald Trump and Jerry Falwell Jr. at Liberty University's commencement ceremony in 2017 The school is noted for its official embrace of Donald Trump before and during his term as U.S. president. The businessman twice spoke at the university Convocation: in 2012, when he was awarded an honorary doctor of business degree, [ 310 ] and in 2016.

[ 311 ] As U.S. president, Trump was the keynote speaker at the May 2017 commencement, when he received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree. Falwell Jr. commended Trump for "bombing those in the Middle East who persecute and kill Christians," and that Trump had "proved that he is a man of his word." [ 311 ] As of 2022, three honorary degrees Trump received from other institutions have been rescinded, but Liberty has not rescinded the two it granted Trump.

[ 312 ] Falwell Jr.'s uncritical support for Trump [ 313 ] [ 314 ] was characterized as a repudiation of Christian values.

[ 315 ] [ 316 ] Various school officials and students criticized this support and the university's ties with Trump.

[ 24 ] [ 317 ] Among them was Mark DeMoss, Falwell's chief of staff, who was forced to resign from Liberty's board of trustees.

[ 318 ] Another was Liberty alumnus Jonathan Merritt, whose invitation to speak on campus was rescinded. Still another was Christian author Jonathan Martin, who was expelled from campus.

[ 318 ] [ 319 ] The school reportedly censored articles critical of Trump in the student newspaper. In 2016, a student editor said that Falwell had censored an opinion column that criticized Trump [ 24 ] [ 15 ] [ 214 ] [ 320 ] for his lewd comments caught on an Access Hollywood tape.

[ 320 ] Other articles in the student newspaper which mentioned Trump were reportedly spiked by faculty members.

[ 321 ] [ 322 ] In 2018, two student editors were fired, reportedly for running articles critical of Trump; one of the student editors lost a $3,000-a-semester scholarship.

[ 321 ] [ 323 ] In 2019, this censorship and other factors led the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education to rank Liberty University among the worst universities in terms of free speech.

[ 324 ] In 2017, some students protested after President Trump criticized both white supremacists and counter-protesters at the August Charlottesville rally where three people died and 33 were injured.

[ 325 ] Following Trump's remarks, Falwell said that he was "so proud" of Trump for his "bold truthful" statement on the tragedy.

[ 325 ] A number of alumni returned their diplomas to Liberty University and called on the university to disavow Trump's remarks.

[ 325 ] [ 326 ] [ 327 ] The graduates argued that Trump's remarks were "incompatible with Liberty University's stated values, and incompatible with a Christian witness." [ 325 ] In 2018, some Liberty students went to Washington, D.C., to support President Trump's Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh .

[ 328 ] That same year, students at the university gave a standing ovation to First Lady of the United States Melania Trump , along with several Trump cabinet officials who spoke at the university during a convocation that focused on the opioid epidemic .

[ 329 ] [ 330 ] [ 331 ] In spring 2018, Liberty's Zaki Gordon Cinematic Arts Center co-produced a feature film called The Trump Prophecy . The film focuses on a retired firefighter from Florida who says God revealed to him in 2011 that Trump would one day be president. The film was shown in some cinemas in October 2018.

[ 332 ] [ 333 ] In 2019, The Wall Street Journal and Inside Higher Education reported that Liberty CIO John Gauger allegedly accepted cash, through his IT consulting firm unaffiliated with the school, to rig two online polls for Trump before he became a candidate.

[ 334 ] [ 335 ] Controversies [ edit ] Jerry Falwell Jr.

In 2019, Will E. Young, a former editor-in-chief of Liberty's Champion student newspaper, described the "culture of fear" at Liberty University, noting that the school "founded on principles of fundamental Christianity, is now a place that has zero tolerance for new questions and ideas. Those who harbor them must remain silent, or leave." [ 336 ] Young later argued that Liberty must address its racist past, beginning with Jerry Falwell Sr. and that it must include people of color and LGBTQ people as it makes decisions.

[ 337 ] In spring 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Liberty allowed some students to return to campus after spring break over the objections of the city's mayor and contrary to the practices of most U.S. colleges and universities.

[ 338 ] [ 339 ] When a ProPublica reporter and The New York Times photographer investigated why the university remained partially open, the university pushed the local district attorney to charge them with trespassing.

[ 340 ] A few months later, then-president Falwell Jr. posted a picture of Virginia's then-governor Ralph Northam 's black face in a tweet that many found racist. Some staff resigned in protest; some black students pursued transfers, [ 341 ] many contending that the tweet was a symptom of a larger problem at the university.

[ 342 ] In response to internal and external criticism, Liberty University officials hired Kelvin Edwards , an alumnus and former NFL player, to lead diversity initiatives on campus, [ 343 ] then fired him three months later. Edwards sued the university, alleging a breach of contract.

[ 343 ] [ 344 ] In fall 2021, an outbreak of COVID-19 forced all classes on the Lynchburg campus to go online-only for two weeks. More than 400 students and 50 staff members tested positive for the virus.

[ 345 ] The campus did not require COVID-19 vaccinations , masks, or social distancing. Outdoor events, including a convocation and football game, were scheduled to continue.

[ 346 ] [ 347 ] In July 2024, Liberty was sued for $300,000 by Ellenor Zinski, whose lawsuit alleges that the university violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 when it fired Zinski, who is transgender, since the university explicitly cited Zinski's gender as the reason for her firing.

[ 348 ] Liberty University contends that Zinski's contract was violated by knowingly breaking LU's policies that are based in their religious beliefs and thus protected by the Constitution.

[ 349 ] Liberty University's doctrinal statement lists "denial of birth sex by self-identification with a different gender" is an example of "sinful acts prohibited by God." [ 350 ] In February 2025, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia denied Liberty's motion to dismiss the case. Liberty's motion to dismiss had been based on first amendment grounds, and parts of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act .

[ 351 ] [ 352 ] Falwell Jr. scandals [ edit ] See also: Jerry Falwell Jr.

Falwell Jr. was placed on indefinite leave on August 7, 2020, after media began reporting allegations, including photographs, of personal and professional impropriety.

[ 353 ] [ 354 ] A few weeks later, he resigned.

[ 355 ] [ 356 ] [ 357 ] [ 358 ] He claimed that he was entitled to $10.5 million in compensation from the university because he resigned without either admitting to wrongdoing or having formal accusations opened against him.

[ 359 ] At the end of Falwell Jr.'s presidency in 2020, the university listed over $2.5 billion in assets.

[ 32 ] Following Falwell's resignation, Times Higher Education reported that Liberty University was "facing growing criticism over perceived resistance to diversity" following the departures of Edwards, board chair Allen McFarland, and pastor David Nasser.

[ 360 ] Jonathan Falwell , a son of Jerry Falwell Sr., replaced Nasser.

In late 2020, three reform efforts took place. A group of Liberty University alumni called Save71 was organized in an effort to reform the school. Three Liberty University athletes, Kennedi Williams, Dee Brown, and TreShaun Clark, organized a Black Lives Matter protest on campus, drawing a crowd of about two hundred people. Student leaders also created an online petition to force Liberty to shut down the school's think tank, the Falkirk Center, named after Jerry Falwell Jr. and conservative activist Charlie Kirk . The petition garnered about 400 signatures.

[ 361 ] In 2020, the university's former president Jerry Falwell Jr. was accused of nepotism , racism, and alcohol use contravening Baptist teaching on teetotalism .

[ 362 ] Falwell and his wife Rebecca were involved in a number of sex scandals.

[ 363 ] [ 364 ] [ 362 ] [ 365 ] These eventually led to his resignation on August 24, 2020.

[ 356 ] The following year, the university sued Falwell Jr. for $40 million in damages for breach of contract and violation of fiduciary duty.

[ 366 ] In the same month, the Liberty University board of trustees replaced acting chairman Allen McFarland, the first African American board chair, with Tim Lee, "a pro-Trump pastor".

[ 367 ] In fall 2024, Falwell's ban on attending on-campus events was rescinded, and he attended that year's homecoming game.

[ 368 ] In May 2025, it was reported that Liberty had paid Falwell Jr. about $15 million to settle all litigation between Liberty and Falwell.

[ 368 ] Mismanagement of sexual assault [ edit ] In July 2021, the university was sued by twelve anonymous women, including two employees, who alleged that the university created an environment that increased the likelihood of sexual assault and rape in violation of federal Title IX law. The lawsuit alleged that the school's student honor code makes it difficult to report sexual violence because it does not clearly shield students; that the university had a tacit policy that condoned sexual violence, especially by male student athletes, by weighing a denial more heavily than an allegation; and that the school retaliates against women who report sexual violence. In one of the alleged incidents, a 15-year-old who was allegedly attacked by Jesse Matthew (Matthew later confessed to murdering Hannah Graham ), was told she would be criminally charged with filing a false report, before they began an "investigation" into her claim.  The investigation allegedly only consisted of a demand that she strip and submit to being photographed naked by the chief of police—which she refused to do. She later was not taken to the hospital but the police later pestered her until she agreed to be photographed naked by a female debate coach. In a written response to the lawsuit, Liberty University officials said "The allegations are deeply troubling, if they turn out to be true", and said that would look into each allegation detailed in the lawsuit.

[ 369 ] [ 370 ] [ 371 ] Ten of the women settled in a confidential agreement.

[ 372 ] Also in July 2021, Liberty University diversity retention officer LeeQuan McLaurin, a black gay man, filed a discrimination lawsuit against the school, claiming that his supervisor's view that Christianity condemns homosexuality forced him to quit.

[ 373 ] An October 2021, a ProPublica investigative report found that Liberty University discouraged and dismissed students coming forward about sexual assault; former students said they were threatened with punishment after coming forward with accusations of sexual assault. Multiple witnesses said school officials manipulated their statements in support of a sexual assault victims to undercut the victims' accounts, eventually expelling one such witness. Additionally, the school neglected to report every case to the Title IX office or to inform students of their option of reporting incidents to law enforcement. Sexual assault victims shared accounts of university staff erroneously telling them that speaking to law enforcement would compromise a Title IX investigation and of being made to sign documents agreeing not to report their sexual assault to the police. According to a Liberty alumna who spoke to ProPublica , after she reported her rape to the university's Title IX office, a school official listed the potential infractions she could be disciplined for in the incident, including having premarital sex.

[ 184 ] Politico also reported that a former Liberty University official, Scott Lamb, also accused Liberty University of violating its 501(c)(3) nonprofit status.

Politico had previously reported that the school had invested in "Republican causes and efforts to promote the Trump administration".

[ 374 ] Lamb told ProPublica that he was fired on October 6, 2021, for telling school officials about staff members' failure to report sexual assaults appropriately. He characterized the tendency of university leaders to ignore sexual assault reports once they made their way up the chain of command as "a conspiracy of silence".

[ 184 ] In fall 2023, a preliminary report by the U.S. Department of Education alleged that school officials had failed to report campus crime and safety statistics, had destroyed evidence of assaults, and had retaliated against at least one employee who raised concerns about violations of the Clery Act , the federal law that requires such disclosures by schools that receive federal funding.

[ 189 ] Crimes the report finds were covered up include sexual assault, stalking, and intimate partner violence. Specific acts by Liberty employees detailed in the report include tasking IT with wiping specific hard drives, failing to secure and potentially shredding incident reports, failing to log or follow up on a police report alleging a rape by an unnamed former university president, re-promoting an employee who was demoted after accusations of drugging and assaulting a colleague, and allowing a football player to remain on the team from 2018 to 2022 despite accusations of rape and of stalking a university employee during that time.

[ 375 ] The report states that the university's culture of "substantially and systematically underreported" crime statistics might trace back as far to 1992.

[ 376 ] Liberty faces a fine of up to $37.5 million for Clery Act violations.

[ 376 ] An alumna who says Liberty pressured her to retract a report of sexual assault told USA Today of potential fines, "A little fine is not going to make them change their ways. They can make back any amount of money with a snap of fingers".

[ 375 ] In March 2024, Liberty University was fined $14 million for the Clery Act violations. As described by NPR , the investigators' final 105-page report documents "serious, persistent, and systemic violations" by officials who "discouraged students from reporting crimes, did not adequately respond to incidents of sexual violence, failed to tell the campus about criminal activities or dangerous situations (such as gas leaks), and did not maintain an accurate or complete list of crimes".

[ 377 ] Liberty was placed on Federal monitoring until April 2026.
