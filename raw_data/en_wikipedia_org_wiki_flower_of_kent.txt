This apple tree at the Botanic Gardens in Cambridge is a descendant of a tree which grew in Isaac Newton's garden at Woolsthorpe Manor . Erroneously photographed with an apple of the "Red Delicious" variety.

The Flower of Kent is a green cultivar of cooking apple . It is pear-shaped, mealy, and sub-acid, and of generally poor quality by today's standards. As its name suggests, this cultivar likely originated from Kent, England .

[ 1 ] Though now largely gone from commercial cultivation, a handful of Flower of Kent trees remain.  Most, if not all, are said to descend from trees at Newton's Woolsthorpe Manor , and nearly all that exist descend from a single tree in East Malling , Kent. One such tree is located in the President's Garden at MIT , although it is known to have produced only one apple.

[ 2 ] Currently, this cultivar remains available at Antique Apple Orchard Inc. in Sweet Home, Oregon.

[ 3 ] According to the story, this is the apple Isaac Newton saw falling to ground from its tree , inspiring his laws of universal gravitation .

The National Fruit Collection at Brogdale [ 4 ] contains an example, listed as "Isaac Newton's Tree" (1948-729).
