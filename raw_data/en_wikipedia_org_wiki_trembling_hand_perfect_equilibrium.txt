[ 1 ] A trembling hand perfect equilibrium is an equilibrium that takes the possibility of off-the-equilibrium play into account by assuming that the players, through a "slip of the hand" or tremble, may choose unintended strategies , albeit with negligible probability .

Definition [ edit ] First define a perturbed game .  A perturbed game is a copy of a base game, with the restriction that only totally mixed strategies are allowed to be played.
A totally mixed strategy is a mixed strategy in an n {\displaystyle n} -player strategic game where every pure strategy is played with positive probability.
This is the "trembling hands" of the players; they sometimes play a different strategy, other than the one they intended to play.  Then define a mixed strategy profile σ σ = ( σ σ 1 , … … , σ σ n ) {\displaystyle \sigma =(\sigma _{1},\ldots ,\sigma _{n})} as being trembling hand perfect if there is a sequence of perturbed games strategy profiles { σ σ k } k = 1 , 2 , … … {\displaystyle \{\sigma ^{k}\}_{k=1,2,\ldots }} that converges to σ σ {\displaystyle \sigma } such that for every k {\displaystyle k} and every player 1 ≤ ≤ i ≤ ≤ n {\displaystyle 1\leq i\leq n} the strategy σ σ i {\displaystyle \sigma _{i}} is the best reply to σ σ − − i k {\displaystyle \sigma _{-i}^{k}} .

Note: All completely mixed Nash equilibria are perfect.

Note 2: The mixed strategy extension of any finite normal-form game has at least one perfect equilibrium.

[ 2 ] Example [ edit ] The game represented in the following normal form matrix has two pure strategies Nash equilibria , namely ⟨ ⟨ Up , Left ⟩ ⟩ {\displaystyle \langle {\text{Up}},{\text{Left}}\rangle } and ⟨ ⟨ Down , Right ⟩ ⟩ {\displaystyle \langle {\text{Down}},{\text{Right}}\rangle } . However, only ⟨ ⟨ U , L ⟩ ⟩ {\displaystyle \langle {\text{U}},{\text{L}}\rangle } is trembling-hand perfect.

Left Right Up 1, 1 2, 0 Down 0, 2 2, 2 Trembling hand perfect equilibrium Assume player 1 (the row player) is playing a mixed strategy ( 1 − − ε ε , ε ε ) {\displaystyle (1-\varepsilon ,\varepsilon )} , for 0 < ε ε < 1 {\displaystyle 0<\varepsilon <1} .

Player 2's expected payoff from playing L is: 1 ( 1 − − ε ε ) + 2 ε ε = 1 + ε ε {\displaystyle 1(1-\varepsilon )+2\varepsilon =1+\varepsilon } Player 2's expected payoff from playing the strategy R is: 0 ( 1 − − ε ε ) + 2 ε ε = 2 ε ε {\displaystyle 0(1-\varepsilon )+2\varepsilon =2\varepsilon } For small values of ε ε {\displaystyle \varepsilon } , player 2 maximizes his expected payoff by placing a minimal weight on R and a maximal weight on L. By symmetry, player 1 should place a minimal weight on D and a maximal weight on U if player 2 is playing the mixed strategy ( 1 − − ε ε , ε ε ) {\displaystyle (1-\varepsilon ,\varepsilon )} .  Hence ⟨ ⟨ U , L ⟩ ⟩ {\displaystyle \langle {\text{U}},{\text{L}}\rangle } is trembling-hand perfect.

However, a similar analysis fails for the strategy profile ⟨ ⟨ D , R ⟩ ⟩ {\displaystyle \langle {\text{D}},{\text{R}}\rangle } .

Assume player 2 is playing a mixed strategy ( ε ε , 1 − − ε ε ) {\displaystyle (\varepsilon ,1-\varepsilon )} . Player 1's expected payoff from playing U is: 1 ε ε + 2 ( 1 − − ε ε ) = 2 − − ε ε {\displaystyle 1\varepsilon +2(1-\varepsilon )=2-\varepsilon } Player 1's expected payoff from playing D is: 0 ε ε + 2 ( 1 − − ε ε ) = 2 − − 2 ε ε {\displaystyle 0\varepsilon +2(1-\varepsilon )=2-2\varepsilon } For all positive values of ε ε {\displaystyle \varepsilon } , player 1 maximizes his expected payoff by placing a minimal weight on D and maximal weight on U. Hence ⟨ ⟨ D , R ⟩ ⟩ {\displaystyle \langle {\text{D}},{\text{R}}\rangle } is not trembling-hand perfect because player 2 (and, by symmetry, player 1) maximizes his expected payoff by deviating most often to L if there is a small chance of error in the behavior of player 1.

Equilibria of two-player games [ edit ] For 2×2 games, the set of trembling-hand perfect equilibria coincides with the set of equilibria consisting of two undominated strategies. In the example above, we see that the equilibrium <Down,Right> is imperfect, as Left (weakly) dominates Right for Player 2 and Up (weakly) dominates Down for Player 1.

[ 3 ] Equilibria of extensive form games [ edit ] Extensive-form trembling hand perfect equilibrium Solution concept in game theory Relationship Subset of Subgame perfect equilibrium , Perfect Bayesian equilibrium , Sequential equilibrium Significance Proposed by Reinhard Selten Used for Extensive form games There are two possible ways of extending the definition of trembling hand perfection to extensive form games .

One may interpret the extensive form as being merely a concise description of a normal form game and apply the concepts described above to this normal form game. In the resulting perturbed games, every strategy of the extensive-form game must be played with non-zero probability. This leads to the notion of a normal-form trembling hand perfect equilibrium .

Alternatively, one may recall that trembles are to be interpreted as modelling mistakes made by the players with some negligible probability when the game is played. Such a mistake would most likely consist of a player making another move than the one intended at some point during play. It would hardly consist of the player choosing another strategy than intended, i.e. a wrong plan for playing the entire game.  To capture this, one may define the perturbed game by requiring that every move at every information set is taken with non-zero probability. Limits of equilibria of such perturbed games as the tremble probabilities go to zero are called extensive-form trembling hand perfect equilibria .

The notions of normal-form and extensive-form trembling hand perfect equilibria are incomparable, i.e., an equilibrium of an extensive-form game may be normal-form trembling hand perfect but not extensive-form trembling hand perfect and vice versa.
As an extreme example of this, Jean-François Mertens has given an example of a two-player extensive form game where no extensive-form trembling hand perfect equilibrium is admissible, i.e., the sets of extensive-form and normal-form trembling hand perfect equilibria for this game are disjoint.

[ citation needed ] An extensive-form trembling hand perfect equilibrium is also a sequential equilibrium . A normal-form trembling hand perfect equilibrium of an extensive form game may be sequential but is not necessarily so. In fact, a normal-form trembling hand perfect equilibrium does not even have to be subgame perfect .

Problems with perfection [ edit ] Myerson (1978) [ 4 ] pointed out that perfection is sensitive to the addition of a strictly dominated strategy, and instead proposed another refinement, known as proper equilibrium .
