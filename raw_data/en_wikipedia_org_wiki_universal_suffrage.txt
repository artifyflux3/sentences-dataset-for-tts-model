For many, the term universal suffrage assumes the exclusion of the young and non-citizens (among others).

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] At the same time, some insist that more inclusion is needed before suffrage can be truly universal.

[ 4 ] Democratic theorists, especially those hoping to achieve more universal suffrage, support presumptive inclusion , where the legal system would protect the voting rights of all subjects unless the government can clearly prove that disenfranchisement is necessary.

[ 5 ] Universal full suffrage includes both the right to vote, also called active suffrage, and the right to be elected, also called passive suffrage .

[ 6 ] History [ edit ] Voting is an important part of the formal democratic process .

The European Parliament is the only international organ elected with universal suffrage (since 1979).

In the first modern democracies, governments restricted the vote to those with property and wealth, which almost always meant a minority of the male population.

[ 7 ] In some jurisdictions, other restrictions existed, such as requiring voters to practice a given religion.

[ 8 ] In all modern democracies, the number of people who could vote has increased progressively with time.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] The 19th century saw many movements advocating "universal [male] suffrage", most notably in Europe and North America.

[ 11 ] [ 9 ] Female suffrage was largely ignored until the latter half of the century, when movements began to thrive; the first of these was in New Zealand, in which all adult women of all ethnicities gained the right to vote in 1893.

[ 12 ] A year later, South Australia granted all citizens the right to vote and stand for election, making it the first place in the world where women could stand as candidates for election to parliament. From there, this groundbreaking reform set a precedent for broader suffrage rights worldwide. However, voting rights were often limited to those of the dominant ethnicity.

[ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] In the United States, after the principle of " One person, one vote " was established in the early 1960s by the U.S. Supreme Court under Earl Warren , [ 16 ] [ 17 ] the U.S. Congress , together with the Warren Court , continued to protect and expand the voting rights of all Americans , especially African Americans, through the Civil Rights Act of 1964 , Voting Rights Act of 1965 and several Supreme Court rulings.

[ 18 ] [ 19 ] In addition, the term " suffrage " is also associated specifically with women's suffrage in the United States ; a movement to extend the franchise to women began in the mid-19th century and culminated in 1920, [ citation needed ] when the United States ratified the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution , guaranteeing the right of women to vote.

[ 20 ] It would be 1928 before voting rights were guaranteed to all women in the UK .

[ 21 ] In more detail [ edit ] France, under the 1793 Jacobin constitution , was the first major country to enact suffrage for all adult males, though it was never formally used in practice (the constitution was immediately suspended before being implemented, and the subsequent election occurred in 1795 after the fall of the Jacobin government in 1794 discredited most ideas associated with them, including that constitution). Elsewhere in the Francophone world, the Republic of Haiti legislated for universal male suffrage in 1816.

[ 22 ] The Second French Republic instituted adult male suffrage after the revolution of 1848 .

[ 9 ] Following the French revolutions, movements in the Western world toward more universal suffrage occurred in the early 19th century, and focused on removing property requirements for voting. In 1867 Germany (the North German Confederation ) enacted suffrage for all adult males. In the United States following the American Civil War , slaves were freed and granted rights of citizens , including suffrage for adult males (although several states established restrictions largely, though not completely, diminishing these rights). In the late-19th and early-20th centuries, the focus of the universal suffrage movement came to include the extension of the right to vote to women , as happened from the post-Civil War era in several Western states and during the 1890s in a number of British colonies.

On 19 September 1893 the British Governor of New Zealand, Lord Glasgow , gave assent to a new electoral act, which meant that New Zealand became the first British-controlled colony in which women had the right to vote in parliamentary elections.

[ 23 ] This was followed shortly after by the colony of South Australia in 1894, which was the second to allow women to vote, but the first colony to permit women to stand for election as well.

[ 24 ] In 1906, the autonomous Russian territory known as Grand Duchy of Finland (which became the Republic of Finland in 1917) became the first territory in the world to implement unrestricted universal suffrage, as women could stand as candidates, unlike in New Zealand, and without indigenous ethnic exclusion, like in Australia. It also led to the election of the world's first female members of parliament the following year .

[ 25 ] [ 26 ] Federal states and colonial or autonomous territories prior to World War I have multiple examples of early introduction of universal suffrage. However, these legal changes were effected with the permission of the British, Russian or other government bodies, which were considered the sovereign nation at the time. For this reason, Australia (1901), New Zealand (1908) and Finland (1917) all have different dates of achieving independent nationhood.

Satirical drawing by Touchatout depicting the birth of universal suffrage, "one of the most sacred rights of Man, born in France on 24 february 1848." The First French Republic adopted universal male suffrage briefly in 1792; it was one of the first national systems that abolished all property requirements as a prerequisite for allowing men to register and vote. Greece recognized full male suffrage in 1844.

[ 27 ] Spain recognized it in the Constitution of 1869 and France and Switzerland have continuously done so since the 1848 Revolution (for resident male citizens). Upon independence in the 19th century, several Latin-American countries and Liberia in Africa initially extended suffrage to all adult males, but subsequently restricted it based on property requirements. The German Empire implemented full male suffrage in 1871.

[ 28 ] In the United States, the Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution , ratified in 1870 during the Reconstruction era , provided that "The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude." This amendment aimed to guarantee the right to vote to African Americans, many of whom had been enslaved in the South prior to the end (1865) of the American Civil War and the 1864–1865 abolition of slavery . Despite the amendment, however, blacks were disfranchised in the former Confederate states after 1877 ; Southern officials ignored the amendment and blocked black citizens from voting through a variety of devices, including poll taxes , literacy tests , and grandfather clauses ; [ 29 ] violence and terrorism were used to intimidate some would-be voters.

[ 30 ] Southern blacks did not effectively receive the right to vote until the Voting Rights Act of 1965 .

[ 29 ] In 1893 the self-governing colony New Zealand became the first country in the world (except for the short-lived 18th-century Corsican Republic ) to grant active universal suffrage by giving women the right to vote. It did not grant universal full suffrage (the right to both vote and be a candidate, or both active and passive suffrage) until 1919.

[ 31 ] In 1902, the Commonwealth of Australia became the first country to grant full suffrage for women, i.e. the rights both to vote and to run for office.

[ 32 ] However, Australia did not implement universal suffrage at this time – nationwide voting rights for Aboriginal Australians were not established until 1962, before that varying by state.

Many societies in the past have denied or abridged political representation on the basis of race or ethnicity, related to discriminatory ideas about citizenship . For example, in apartheid -era South Africa, non-White people could generally not vote in national elections until the first multi-party elections in 1994 . However, a nonracial franchise existed under the Cape Qualified Franchise , which was replaced by a number of separate MPs in 1936 (Blacks) and 1958 (Coloureds). Later, the Tricameral Parliament established separate chambers for Whites, Coloureds and Indians. Rhodesia enacted a similar statute to the former in its proclaimed independence of 1965, which however allowed a smaller number of representatives for the considerably larger Black majority (under its 1961 constitution, the voting classes had been based on socio-economic standards, which marginalized most Black and a few White voters to a separate set of constituencies, under the principle of weighted voting ; this was replaced in 1969 by an explicitly racial franchise, with delegated all Blacks to the 'B' voters roll).

Women's suffrage [ edit ] Main article: Women's suffrage In Sweden (including Swedish-ruled Finland ), women's suffrage was granted during the Age of Liberty from 1718 until 1772.

[ 33 ] In Corsica , women's suffrage was granted in 1755 and lasted until 1769.

[ 34 ] Women's suffrage (with the same property qualifications as for men) was granted in New Jersey in 1776 (the word "inhabitants" was used instead of "men" in the 1776 Constitution) and rescinded in 1807.

The Pitcairn Islands granted restricted women's suffrage in 1838. Various other countries and states granted restricted women's suffrage in the later half of the nineteenth century, starting with South Australia in 1861.

The first unrestricted women's suffrage in a major country was granted in New Zealand in 1893.

[ 31 ] The women's suffrage bill was adopted mere weeks before the general election of 1893. Māori men had been granted suffrage in 1867, white men in 1879. The Freedom in the World index lists New Zealand as the only free country in the world in 1893.

[ 34 ] South Australia first granted women suffrage and allowed them to stand for parliament in 1894 .

In 1906, the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland became the first territory to give women full political rights, i.e. both the right to vote and to run for office, and was the second in the world and the first in Europe to give women the right to vote.

[ 25 ] [ 26 ] The world's first female members of parliament were elected in Finland the following year, 1907. After the German Revolution of 1918–19, the Weimar Constitution established universal suffrage in 1919 with a minimum voting age of 20.

The UK gave women the right to vote at the same age as men (21) in 1928.

In 1931, the Second Spanish Republic allowed women the right of passive suffrage with three women being elected.

During a discussion on extending women's right to active suffrage, the Radical Socialist Victoria Kent confronted the Radical Clara Campoamor . Kent argued that Spanish women were not yet prepared to vote and, since they were too influenced by the Catholic Church , they would vote for right-wing candidates. Campoamor however pleaded for women's rights regardless of political orientation. Her point finally prevailed and, in the election of 1933, the political right won with the vote of citizens of any sex over 23. Both Campoamor and Kent lost their seats.

In Switzerland, women's suffrage was introduced at the federal level, by a nationwide (male) referendum in 1971, but the referendum did not give women the right to vote at the local Cantonal level. The Cantons independently voted to grant women the right to vote. The first Canton to give women the right to vote was Vaud in 1959. The last Canton, Appenzell Innerrhoden , had a centuries-old law forbidding women to vote. This was only changed in 1990 when Switzerland's Federal Court ordered the Canton to grant women the right to vote.

[ 35 ] Youth suffrage [ edit ] Main article: Youth suffrage The movement to lower the voting age many consider an aspect of universal suffrage [ 36 ] that the youth rights movement has helped to lead. Organizations such as the National Youth Rights Association are active in the United States to advocate for a lower voting age, with some success, [ 37 ] among other issues related to youth rights. A related movement, suffrage for Americans with disabilities provides important precedents and intersectionality with the movement to extend voting rights to children and youth.

[ 5 ] Non-resident citizen voting [ edit ] Main article: Non-resident citizen voting Some jurisdictions don't require to be present in the country of citizenship to vote.

[ 38 ] Multiple citizenship and non-citizen suffrage [ edit ] Main articles: Multiple citizenship and Non-citizen suffrage Some persons have the right to vote in multiple countries due to multiple citizenship or due to non-citizen suffrage and residency status.

Switzerland 1990 1848 1990 1866 In the short-lived Helvetic Republic (1798–1803) men above the age of 20 had the right to vote. At the formation of today's federal state in 1848, Switzerland reintroduced universal male suffrage, but Jews did not have the same political rights as Christian citizens until 1866.

Women's suffrage was introduced at the national level after a nationwide (male) referendum in 1971, but the referendum did not give women the right to vote at the cantonal level.

Among the constituent states of the Old Swiss Confederacy , universal male suffrage is first attested in Uri in 1231, in Schwyz in 1294, in Unterwalden in 1309, and in Appenzell in 1403. In these rural communities all men fit for military service were allowed to participate in the Landsgemeinde , which managed political and judicial affairs.

[ 104 ] The UAE is an authoritarian state.

[ 105 ] [ 106 ] United Kingdom 1928 1918 1928 1791 The Roman Catholic Relief Act 1791 removed the dependence of voting rights on religion [ nb 4 ] in the Kingdom of Great Britain . The right to vote has never since been based on race or religion.

[ nb 6 ] All adult men in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland were enfranchised by the Representation of the People Act 1918 .

[ 77 ] This Act granted women over 30 the right to vote in national elections, [ nb 5 ] but about 60% of women (those under 30 or not meeting property qualifications) were excluded until the Equal Franchise Act 1928 , when women were granted the vote on the same terms as men in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

[ 113 ] The Representation of the People Act 1948 removed plural voting rights held by about 7% of the electorate.

[ 114 ] [ nb 7 ] The Representation of the People Act 1969 reduced the voting age from 21 to 18, the first major democratic country to do so.

[ 116 ] [ 117 ] As of 2019, 529,902 British nationals ( 257,646 people in Crown Dependencies and 272,256 people in British Overseas Territories ) are represented in local legislatures in their territories but not in the House of Commons , unless they are resident in the United Kingdom.

[ 118 ] [ nb 8 ] United States 1965 [ nb 9 ] 1856 [ nb 10 ] 1920 [ nb 11 ] 1965 [ nb 9 ] In the colonial era, there had been various restrictions on suffrage in what is today the United States. Property restrictions on voting disenfranchised more than half of the white male population in most states.

[ 126 ] After the American Revolution, the Constitution did not originally define who was eligible to vote, allowing each state to determine who was eligible. In the early history of the U.S., most states allowed only white male adult property owners to vote (about 6% of the population).

[ 127 ] [ 128 ] Vermont, Pennsylvania, and Kentucky were the three states to have full adult suffrage for white males before 1800. New Jersey allowed women's suffrage for landowners until the early 1800s.

In the 1820 election , there were 108,359 ballots cast. In the 1840 election , 2,412,694 ballots were cast, an increase that far outstripped natural population growth. Poor voters became a huge part of the electorate. By 1856, after the period of Jacksonian democracy , all states had almost universal white adult male suffrage regardless of property ownership. Tax-paying requirements remained in five states, and two into the 20th century.

[ 129 ] [ 130 ] In 1868, the 14th Amendment altered the way each state is represented in the House of Representatives . It counted all residents for apportionment including former slaves, overriding the three-fifths compromise , and reduced a state's apportionment if it wrongfully denied men aged 21 and above the right to vote. However, this was not enforced in practice. In 1870, the 15th Amendment granted suffrage to all males of any race, skin color, and ethnicity, including former slaves (freedmen), meaning that male African Americans in theory had the right to vote throughout the United States.

[ 131 ] Starting in 1888, former Confederate states passed Jim Crow laws and amendments to effectively disfranchise black and poor white voters through poll taxes , literacy tests , grandfather clauses and other restrictions, applied in a discriminatory manner. During this period, the Supreme Court generally upheld state efforts to discriminate against racial minorities; only later in the 20th century were these laws ruled unconstitutional. Black males in the Northern states could vote, but the majority of African Americans lived in the South.

[ 132 ] [ 133 ] Wyoming was the first territory to enfranchise all women in 1869. From then until 1916, all Western states legalized women suffrage, but few Eastern states followed suit. However, in 1920 the 19th Amendment extended the franchise to women in all states.

[ 134 ] In 1924 the Indian Citizenship Act gave suffrage to all Native Americans, nearly two-thirds of whom already had citizenship and the right to vote.

[ 135 ] In 1943 Chinese immigrants were given the right to citizenship and the right to vote by the Magnuson Act . It allowed some Chinese immigration for the first time since the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, and permitted some Chinese immigrants already residing in the country to become naturalized citizens .

In 1962–1964, the nationwide " one man, one vote " electoral system was lawfully established mainly through the Warren Court 's rulings in Baker v. Carr (1962), Reynolds v. Sims (1964), as well as Wesberry v. Sanders (1964).

[ 136 ] [ 137 ] [ 138 ] In 1964–1965, the 24th Amendment , which abolished the use of poll taxes as a requirement for voting in federal elections, was passed.

[ 139 ] [ 140 ] Full enfranchisement was revived in 1965, with the passage of Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965 , which provided for federal enforcement of rights.

[ 18 ] For state elections, it was not until the Warren Court ruled 6–3 in Harper v. Virginia Board of Elections (1966) that all state poll taxes were unconstitutional as violating the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

[ 19 ] This removed a burden on the poor.

[ 124 ] [ 125 ] In 1971, the 26th Amendment ratified, which granted suffrage for men and women aged 18.

Currently 4 million American citizens living in the Territories of the United States do not have representation in the United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate .

The 1979 Lancaster House constitution agreed to accommodate the nationalists and also affirmed universal suffrage but with a special role for whites. Universal suffrage with no special consideration for race came in 1987. Before 1978, Rhodesia (the name for the region that would become Zimbabwe in 1980) had a merit qualification to vote. This was controversial because it excluded the vast majority of native Africans. Though white women were granted the right to vote in 1919.

^ a b Over the years suffrage increased and decreased based on the introduction, repeal and reintroduction of various degrees of universal, property and census-based suffrage. Universal male suffrage was given in 1848 and in 1944 women had equal universal suffrage rights to men. The military obtained the right to vote in 1945.

^ In 1792, the Convention assembly was elected by all French males 21 and over regardless of one's ethnicity. While not an ethnicity, those serving in the military obtained the right to vote in 1945.

^ a b the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829 reflects eligibility for office, not the eligibility to vote.

^ a b Until the Reform Act 1832 specified "male persons", a few women had been able to vote in parliamentary elections through property ownership, although this was rare.

[ 108 ] In local government elections, women lost the right to vote under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835 . Unmarried women ratepayers received the right to vote in the Municipal Franchise Act 1869. This right was confirmed in the Local Government Act 1894 and extended to include some married women.

[ 109 ] [ 110 ] [ 111 ] By 1900, over 1 million women were registered for local government elections in England.

[ 112 ] ^ While local government gerrymandering in Northern Ireland was one of the factors which led to the Troubles , [ 107 ] parliamentary elections still took place for all British citizens. In 1972 the British Parliament was unwilling to grant the mostly Protestant unionist Northern Ireland government more authoritarian special powers since it was now convinced of its inability to restore order. So they suspended the Parliament of Northern Ireland and the post of Governor and made provision for direct rule by the elected government of the United Kingdom.

^ Graduates of universities lost the right to vote in university constituencies as well as parliamentary boroughs and property owners lost the right to vote both in the constituency where their property lay and that in which they lived, if the two were different. For elections to the Parliament of Northern Ireland , these changes were made under the Electoral Law Act 1968.

[ 115 ] ^ Most of the British Overseas Territories and all of the Crown Dependencies have a local representative government, although ultimate authority still resides in Westminster. Legislation has been proposed in past to create parliamentary districts for the British Overseas Territories and the Crown Dependencies, though as of 2020 no bill has been put forward by the British government [ 119 ] [ 120 ] [ 121 ] [ 122 ] [ 123 ] British nationality law has changed over the years has redefined who has the birthright to live and work in the UK. In 1968 and 1971 , as a result of fears about increasing immigration by non-white British citizens, the UK Government introduced immigration restrictions and stripped birthrights on British subjects from some British Overseas Territories. The current principal British nationality law in force, since 1 January 1983, is the British Nationality Act 1981 , which established the system of multiple categories of British nationality.

^ a b While constitutionally given the right to vote by the Fifteenth Amendment in 1870 and 19th Amendment in 1920, the reality of the country was such that most African Americans and some poor whites could not vote until the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 .

Starting in 1888 Southern states legalized disenfranchisement by enacting Jim Crow laws ; they amended their constitutions and passed legislation to impose various voting restrictions, including literacy tests, poll taxes, property-ownership requirements, moral character tests, requirements that applicants interpret a particular document, and grandfather clauses that allowed otherwise-ineligible persons to vote if their grandfathers voted (which excluded many African Americans whose grandfathers had been ineligible). During this period, the Supreme Court generally upheld state efforts to discriminate against racial minorities. In Giles v. Harris (1903), the Court held that irrespective of the Fifteenth Amendment, the judiciary did not have the remedial power to force states to register racial minorities to vote. The Indian Citizenship Act in 1924 gave Native Americans the right to vote and officially recognized them as citizens, nearly two-thirds of whom already had citizenship and the right to vote. In 1943 Chinese immigrants were given the right to citizenship and the right to vote by the Magnuson Act . African Americans and others gained full enfranchisement through passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 .

^ The 1828 presidential election was the first in which non-property-holding white males could vote in the vast majority of states, but this was not consistent across the country until the last state, North Carolina, abolished property qualification in 1856 resulting in a close approximation to universal white male suffrage (however tax-paying requirements remained in five states in 1860 and survived in two states until the 20th century). The Fourteenth Amendment in 1868 altered the way each state is represented in the House of Representatives . It counted all residents for apportionment including slaves, overriding the three-fifths compromise , and reduced a state's apportionment if it wrongfully denied males over the age of 21 the right to vote; however, this was not enforced in practice. Some poor white men remained excluded at least until 1965.

[ 124 ] [ 125 ] For state elections, it was not until the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 6–3 in Harper v. Virginia Board of Elections (1966) that all state poll taxes were unconstitutional as violating the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. This removed a burden on the poor.

Abdullah was already the first Saudi ruler to have presided over elections. Admittedly the voting, held in the spring of 2005, was only for local, virtually powerless municipal councils -- and then for only half the seats on those; women were not allowed to stand for office or to vote. But the male electorate got the change to eat large quantities of mutton for three weeks since Saudi electioneering proved to revolve around lamb and tents ... the candidate held court, inviting voters inside [their tents] and plying them with mountains of rice and whole roasted sheep.

By 1840, only three states retained a property qualification, North Carolina (for some state-wide offices only), Rhode Island, and Virginia. In 1856 North Carolina was the last state to end the practice. Tax-paying qualifications were also gone in all but a few states by the Civil War, but they survived into the 20th century in Pennsylvania and Rhode Island.
