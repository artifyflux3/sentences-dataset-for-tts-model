Aravindan , Hariharan , M. T. Vasudevan Nair , Padmarajan , Bharathan and Lohithadas .

[ 38 ] Mohanlal, along with actor and scriptwriter Sreenivasan , who played his sidekick in several films, showcased the angst of unemployed, educated Malayali youth forced to adapt to hostile environments in many realistic social satires, [ 39 ] some of which were written by Sreenivasan himself.

He played Solomon in Padmarajan's Namukku Parkkan Munthirithoppukal .

[ 36 ] Mohanlal later recalled that his portrayal of Sethumadhavan's mental agony, commended as a natural performance, was spontaneous and that he "did what Sethumadhavan, my character, would have done in such a situation", adding that acting was "akin to entering another person's body."

[ 43 ] [ 44 ] In 1989, he starred in another one of Padmarajan's movies; Season .

His romantic comedy Kilukkam in 1991 won him a State Film Award for Best Actor. The film is considered one of the greatest comedy films of all time in Malayalam. It also became the highest-grossing Malayalam film of the time. In 1991, Mohanlal produced and starred in Bharatham , which is interpreted as a modern-day adaptation of the Ramayana from Bharath 's perspective.

[ 53 ] [ 54 ] In 1998, he produced and starred in Harikrishnans , co-starring Mammootty and Juhi Chawla . The film was a commercial success, but was not well received by critics.

[ 55 ] The film had dual climaxes , which were screened in different regions, based on the popularity of the two lead actors in each particular region.

[ 56 ] This, however, became controversial and took a communal turn when lawsuits were filed claiming that prints exhibited in Hindu -dominated areas showed Mohanlal marrying the heroine, whereas the ones in Muslim -dominated areas showed Mammootty marrying her. The major issue was that the film showed uncensored scenes, as the submitted cut of the film to the Central Board of Film Certification was the version in which Mohanlal wins the leading lady. Hence they were forced to remove the Mammootty version from theatres, replacing it with the original. However, in television premieres, both film versions were shown.

[ 57 ] Mohanlal depicted a Kathakali artist whose personal life is a tragedy in the 1999 Indo-French period drama Vanaprastham , produced by him and directed by Shaji N. Karun .

Except for Ravanaprabhu , these films were widely criticised for their repetitive plots, lewd dialogues, punch lines and male chauvinistic outlook.

[ 63 ] [ 64 ] [ 65 ] A critic from The New Indian Express wrote: "The Narasimham hangover is terrifically strong and it has, at least for the moment, killed the prospects of good films. I don't see any other reason for the failure of well made female-oriented films like Mazha and Madhuranombarakkattu ".
