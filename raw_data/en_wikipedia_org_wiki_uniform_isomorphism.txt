Uniform spaces with uniform maps form a category . An isomorphism between uniform spaces is called a uniform isomorphism.

Definition [ edit ] A function f {\displaystyle f} between two uniform spaces X {\displaystyle X} and Y {\displaystyle Y} is called a uniform isomorphism if it satisfies the following properties f {\displaystyle f} is a bijection f {\displaystyle f} is uniformly continuous the inverse function f − − 1 {\displaystyle f^{-1}} is uniformly continuous In other words, a uniform isomorphism is a uniformly continuous bijection between uniform spaces whose inverse is also uniformly continuous.

If a uniform isomorphism exists between two uniform spaces they are called uniformly isomorphic or uniformly equivalent .

Uniform embeddings A uniform embedding is an injective uniformly continuous map i : X → → Y {\displaystyle i:X\to Y} between uniform spaces whose inverse i − − 1 : i ( X ) → → X {\displaystyle i^{-1}:i(X)\to X} is also uniformly continuous, where the image i ( X ) {\displaystyle i(X)} has the subspace uniformity inherited from Y .

{\displaystyle Y.} Examples [ edit ] The uniform structures induced by equivalent norms on a vector space are uniformly isomorphic.
