**White blood cells** (scientific name **leukocytes**), also called **immune cells** or **immunocytes**, are [cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology) "Cell (biology)") of the [immune system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system "Immune system") that are involved in protecting the body against both [infectious disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_disease "Infectious disease") and foreign entities. White blood cells are generally larger than [red blood cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cells "Red blood cells"). They include three main subtypes: [granulocytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granulocyte "Granulocyte"), [lymphocytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte "Lymphocyte") and [monocytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocyte "Monocyte").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell#cite_note-2)

All white blood cells are produced and derived from [multipotent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multipotent "Multipotent") cells in the [bone marrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow "Bone marrow") known as [hematopoietic stem cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell "Hematopoietic stem cell").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell#cite_note-Monga-3) Leukocytes are found throughout the body, including the [blood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood "Blood") and [lymphatic system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphatic_system "Lymphatic system").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell#cite_note-4) All white blood cells have [nuclei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus "Cell nucleus"), which distinguishes them from the other [blood cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_cell "Blood cell"), the anucleated [red blood cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell "Red blood cell") (RBCs) and [platelets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet "Platelet"). The different white blood cells are usually classified by [cell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_division "Cell division") lineage ([myeloid cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelocyte "Myelocyte") or [lymphoid cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte "Lymphocyte")). White blood cells are part of the body's immune system. They help the body fight [infection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection "Infection") and other diseases. Types of white blood cells are granulocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils), and agranulocytes ([monocytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocyte "Monocyte"), and [lymphocytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte "Lymphocyte") (T cells and B cells)).[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell#cite_note-5) Myeloid cells ([myelocytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelocytes "Myelocytes")) include [neutrophils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrophil_granulocyte "Neutrophil granulocyte"), [eosinophils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eosinophil_granulocyte "Eosinophil granulocyte"), [mast cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mast_cells "Mast cells"), [basophils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basophil_granulocyte "Basophil granulocyte"), and [monocytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocyte "Monocyte").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell#cite_note-isbn978-0-323-04950-4-6) Monocytes are further subdivided into [dendritic cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendritic_cells "Dendritic cells") and [macrophages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophages "Macrophages"). Monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils are [phagocytic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phagocytic "Phagocytic"). Lymphoid cells ([lymphocytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocytes "Lymphocytes")) include [T cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cells "T cells") (subdivided into [helper T cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helper_T_cell "Helper T cell"), [memory T cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_T_cell "Memory T cell"), [cytotoxic T cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxic_T_cell "Cytotoxic T cell")), [B cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_cells "B cells") (subdivided into [plasma cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_cells "Plasma cells") and [memory B cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_B_cells "Memory B cells")), and [natural killer cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_killer_cells "Natural killer cells"). Historically, white blood cells were classified by their physical characteristics ([granulocytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granulocytes "Granulocytes") and [agranulocytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agranulocytes "Agranulocytes")), but this classification system is less frequently used now. Produced in the [bone marrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow "Bone marrow"), white blood cells defend the body against [infections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection "Infection") and [disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease "Disease"). An excess of white blood cells is usually due to infection or inflammation. Less commonly, a high white blood cell count could indicate certain blood cancers or bone marrow disorders.

The number of leukocytes in the blood is often an indicator of [disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease "Disease"), and thus the _white blood cell count_ is an important subset of the [complete blood count](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_blood_count "Complete blood count"). The normal white cell count [is usually](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_ranges_for_blood_tests "Reference ranges for blood tests") between 4 billion/L and 11 billion/L. In the US, this is usually expressed as 4,000 to 11,000 white blood cells per microliter of blood.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell#cite_note-7) White blood cells make up approximately 1% of the total blood volume in a healthy adult,[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell#cite_note-alberts_table-8) making them substantially less numerous than the [red blood cells at 40% to 45%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematocrit "Hematocrit"). However, this 1% of the blood makes a huge difference to health because [immunity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical) "Immunity (medical)") depends on it. An increase in the number of leukocytes over the [upper limits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_ranges_for_blood_tests#White_blood_cells_2 "Reference ranges for blood tests") is called [leukocytosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukocytosis "Leukocytosis"). It is normal when it is part of healthy immune responses, which happen frequently. It is occasionally abnormal when it is [neoplastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm "Neoplasm") or [autoimmune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmunity "Autoimmunity") in origin. A decrease below the lower limit is called [leukopenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukopenia "Leukopenia"), which indicates a weakened immune system.

The name "white blood cell" derives from the physical appearance of a blood sample after [centrifugation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrifugation "Centrifugation"). White cells are found in the _[buffy coat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffy\_coat "Buffy coat")_, a thin, typically white layer of nucleated cells between the sedimented [red blood cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell "Red blood cell") and the [blood plasma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma "Blood plasma"). The scientific term _leukocyte_ directly reflects its description. It is derived from the [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language "Greek language") roots _[leuk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_Greek\_and\_Latin\_roots#L "List of Greek and Latin roots")-_ meaning "white" and _[cyt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_Greek\_and\_Latin\_roots#C "List of Greek and Latin roots")-_ meaning "cell". The [buffy coat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffy_coat "Buffy coat") may sometimes be green if there are large amounts of [neutrophils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrophil "Neutrophil") in the sample, due to the [heme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heme "Heme")-containing enzyme [myeloperoxidase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloperoxidase "Myeloperoxidase") that they produce.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

All white blood cells are nucleated, which distinguishes them from the anucleated red blood cells and platelets. Types of leukocytes can be classified in standard ways. Two pairs of broadest categories classify them either by structure ([granulocytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granulocyte "Granulocyte") or [agranulocytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agranulocyte "Agranulocyte")) or by cell lineage (myeloid cells or lymphoid cells). These broadest categories can be further divided into the five main types: [neutrophils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrophil "Neutrophil"), [eosinophils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eosinophil "Eosinophil"), [basophils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basophil "Basophil"), [lymphocytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte "Lymphocyte"), and [monocytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocyte "Monocyte").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell#cite_note-isbn978-0-323-04950-4-6) A good way to remember the relative proportions of WBCs is "Never Let Monkeys Eat Bananas".[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell#cite_note-9) These types are distinguished by their physical and functional characteristics. Monocytes and neutrophils are [phagocytic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phagocytic "Phagocytic"). Further subtypes can be classified.

Granulocytes are distinguished from agranulocytes by their nucleus shape (lobed versus round, that is, polymorphonuclear versus mononuclear) and by their cytoplasm [granules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granule_(cell_biology) "Granule (cell biology)") (present or absent, or more precisely, visible on light microscopy or not thus visible). The other dichotomy is by lineage: Myeloid cells (neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils and basophils) are distinguished from lymphoid cells (lymphocytes) by [hematopoietic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematopoiesis "Haematopoiesis") lineage ([cellular differentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation "Cellular differentiation") lineage).[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell#cite_note-10) Lymphocytes can be further classified as T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells.

Neutrophil engulfing [anthrax bacteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacillus_anthracis "Bacillus anthracis")

Neutrophils are the most abundant white blood cell, constituting 60–70% of the circulating leukocytes.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell#cite_note-alberts_table-8) They defend against [bacterial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria "Bacteria") or [fungal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungal "Fungal") infection. They are usually first responders to microbial infection; their activity and death in large numbers form [pus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pus "Pus"). They are commonly referred to as polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocytes, although, in the technical sense, PMN refers to all granulocytes. They have a multi-lobed nucleus, which consists of three to five lobes connected by slender strands.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell#cite_note-Saladin-13) This gives the neutrophils the appearance of having multiple nuclei, hence the name polymorphonuclear leukocyte. The cytoplasm may look transparent because of fine granules that are pale lilac when stained. Neutrophils are active in phagocytosing bacteria and are present in large amount in the pus of wounds. These cells are not able to renew their [lysosomes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysosome "Lysosome") (used in digesting microbes) and die after having phagocytosed a few pathogens.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell#cite_note-14) Neutrophils are the most common cell type seen in the early stages of acute inflammation. The average lifespan of inactivated human neutrophils in the circulation has been reported by different approaches to be between 5 and 135 hours.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell#cite_note-Tak2013-15)[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell#cite_note-16)

Eosinophils compose about 2–4% of white blood cells in circulating blood. This count fluctuates throughout the day, seasonally, and during [menstruation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstruation "Menstruation"). It rises in response to allergies, parasitic infections, collagen diseases, and disease of the spleen and central nervous system. They are rare in the blood, but numerous in the mucous membranes of the respiratory, digestive, and lower urinary tracts.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell#cite_note-Saladin-13)

They primarily deal with [parasitic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitic "Parasitic") infections. Eosinophils are also the predominant inflammatory cells in allergic reactions. The most important causes of eosinophilia include allergies such as asthma, hay fever, and hives; and parasitic infections. They secrete chemicals that destroy large parasites, such as hookworms and tapeworms, that are too big for any one white blood cell to phagocytize. In general, their nuclei are bi-lobed. The lobes are connected by a thin strand.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell#cite_note-Saladin-13) The cytoplasm is full of granules that assume a characteristic pink-orange color with [eosin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eosin "Eosin") staining.

The movement of leukocytes in the blood, phase-contrast microscopy

Basophils are chiefly responsible for [allergic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy "Allergy") and [antigen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen "Antigen") response by releasing the chemical [histamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histamine "Histamine") causing the [dilation of blood vessels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation "Vasodilation"). Because they are the rarest of the white blood cells (less than 0.5% of the total count) and share physicochemical properties with other blood cells, they are difficult to study.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell#cite_note-17) They can be recognized by several coarse, dark violet granules, giving them a blue hue. The nucleus is bi- or tri-lobed, but it is hard to see because of the number of coarse granules that hide it.

They secrete two chemicals that aid in the body's defenses: [histamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histamine "Histamine") and [heparin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heparin "Heparin"). Histamine is responsible for widening blood vessels and increasing the flow of blood to injured tissue. It also makes blood vessels more permeable so neutrophils and clotting proteins can get into connective tissue more easily. Heparin is an anticoagulant that inhibits blood clotting and promotes the movement of white blood cells into an area. Basophils can also release chemical signals that attract eosinophils and neutrophils to an infection site.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell#cite_note-Saladin-13)

Lymphocytes are much more common in the lymphatic system than in blood. Lymphocytes are distinguished by having a deeply staining nucleus that may be eccentric in location, and a relatively small amount of cytoplasm. Lymphocytes include:

*   [B cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_cell "B cell") make [antibodies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody "Antibody") that can bind to [pathogens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogens "Pathogens"), block pathogen invasion, activate the [complement system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_system "Complement system"), and enhance pathogen destruction.
*   [T cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell "T cell"): 
    *   [CD4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4 "CD4")+ [T helper cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell "T helper cell"): T cells displaying [co-receptor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-receptor "Co-receptor")[CD4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4 "CD4") are known as CD4+ T cells. These cells have [T-cell receptors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-cell_receptor "T-cell receptor") and CD4 molecules that, in combination, bind [antigenic peptides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigens "Antigens") presented on [major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MHC_class_II "MHC class II") molecules on [antigen-presenting cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen-presenting_cells "Antigen-presenting cells"). Helper T cells make [cytokines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine "Cytokine") and perform other functions that help coordinate the [immune response](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_response "Immune response"). In [HIV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV "HIV") infection, these T cells are the main index to identify the individual's immune system integrity.
    *   [CD8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD8 "CD8")+ [cytotoxic T cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxic_T_cells "Cytotoxic T cells"): T cells displaying co-receptor [CD8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD8 "CD8") are known as CD8+ T cells. These cells bind antigens presented on [MHC I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MHC_I "MHC I") complex of virus-infected or tumour cells and kill them. Nearly all nucleated cells display MHC I.
    *   [γδ T cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%93%CE%B4_T_cell "Γδ T cell") possess an alternative [T cell receptor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell_receptor "T cell receptor") (different from the αβ TCR found on conventional CD4+ and CD8+ T cells). Found in tissue more commonly than in blood, γδ T cells share characteristics of helper T cells, cytotoxic T cells, and natural killer cells.

*   [Natural killer cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_killer_cell "Natural killer cell") are able to kill cells of the body that do not display [MHC class I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MHC_class_I "MHC class I") molecules, or display stress markers such as [MHC class I polypeptide–related sequence A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MHC_class_I_polypeptide%E2%80%93related_sequence_A "MHC class I polypeptide–related sequence A") (MIC-A). Decreased expression of MHC class I and up-regulation of MIC-A can happen when cells are infected by a virus or become cancerous.

Monocytes, the largest type of white blood cell, share the "vacuum cleaner" ([phagocytosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phagocytosis "Phagocytosis")) function of neutrophils, but are much longer lived as they have an extra role: they present pieces of [pathogens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen "Pathogen") to T cells so that the pathogens may be recognized again and killed. This causes an antibody response to be mounted. Monocytes eventually leave the bloodstream and become tissue [macrophages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage "Macrophage"), which remove dead cell debris as well as attack microorganisms. Neither dead cell debris nor attacking microorganisms can be dealt with effectively by the neutrophils. Unlike neutrophils, monocytes are able to replace their [lysosomal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysosome "Lysosome") contents and are thought to have a much longer active life. They have the kidney-shaped nucleus and are typically not granulated. They also possess abundant cytoplasm.

Some leucocytes migrate into the tissues of the body to take up a permanent residence at that location rather than remaining in the blood. Often these cells have specific names depending upon which tissue they settle in, such as fixed macrophages in the liver, which become known as [Kupffer cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kupffer_cell "Kupffer cell"). These cells still serve a role in the immune system.

The two commonly used categories of white blood cell disorders divide them [quantitatively](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/quantitative#Adjective "wikt:quantitative") into those causing excessive numbers ([proliferative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth "Cell growth") disorders) and those causing insufficient numbers ([leukopenias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukopenia "Leukopenia")).[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell#cite_note-Al2010-18)[Leukocytosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukocytosis "Leukocytosis") is usually healthy (e.g., fighting an [infection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection "Infection")), but it also may be dysfunctionally proliferative. Proliferative disorders of white blood cells can be classed as [myeloproliferative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloproliferative_neoplasm "Myeloproliferative neoplasm") and [lymphoproliferative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoproliferative_disorders "Lymphoproliferative disorders"). Some are [autoimmune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmunity "Autoimmunity"), but many are [neoplastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm "Neoplasm").

Another way to categorize disorders of white blood cells is [qualitatively](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/qualitative#Adjective "wikt:qualitative"). There are various disorders in which the number of white blood cells is normal but the cells do not function normally.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell#cite_note-Williamshematology2010-19)

Neoplasia of white blood cells can be [benign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benign_tumor "Benign tumor") but is often [malignant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy "Malignancy"). Of the various [tumors of the blood and lymph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumors_of_the_hematopoietic_and_lymphoid_tissues "Tumors of the hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues"), [cancers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer "Cancer") of white blood cells can be broadly classified as [leukemias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia "Leukemia") and [lymphomas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma "Lymphoma"), although those categories overlap and are often grouped together.

A range of disorders can cause decreases in white blood cells. This type of white blood cell decreased is usually the neutrophil. In this case the decrease may be called [neutropenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutropenia "Neutropenia") or granulocytopenia. Less commonly, a decrease in lymphocytes (called [lymphocytopenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocytopenia "Lymphocytopenia") or lymphopenia) may be seen.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell#cite_note-Al2010-18)

[Neutropenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutropenia "Neutropenia") can be [acquired](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquired_characteristic "Acquired characteristic") or [intrinsic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder "Congenital disorder").[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell#cite_note-20) A decrease in levels of neutrophils on lab tests is due to either decreased production of neutrophils or increased removal from the blood.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell#cite_note-Al2010-18)

*   Medications – [chemotherapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy "Chemotherapy"), sulfas or other [antibiotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic "Antibiotic"), [phenothiazines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenothiazine "Phenothiazine"), [benzodiazepines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines "Benzodiazepines"), [antithyroid medications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antithyroid_medications "Antithyroid medications"), [anticonvulsants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticonvulsant "Anticonvulsant"), [quinine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinine "Quinine"), [quinidine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinidine "Quinidine"), [indometacin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indometacin "Indometacin"), [procainamide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procainamide "Procainamide"), [thiazides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiazide "Thiazide")

*   Any major infection
*   Miscellaneous – [starvation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starvation "Starvation"), [hypersplenism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersplenism "Hypersplenism")

Symptoms of neutropenia are associated with the underlying cause of the decrease in neutrophils. For example, the most common cause of acquired neutropenia is drug-induced, so an individual may have symptoms of [medication overdose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_overdose "Drug overdose") or toxicity. Treatment is also aimed at the underlying cause of the neutropenia.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell#cite_note-Schafer_a-21) One severe consequence of neutropenia is that it can increase the risk of infection.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell#cite_note-Williamshematology2010-19)

Defined as total lymphocyte count below 1.0 billion/L, the cells most commonly affected are CD4+ T cells. Like neutropenia, lymphocytopenia may be acquired or intrinsic and there are many causes.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell#cite_note-Williamshematology2010-19) This is not a complete list.

Like neutropenia, symptoms and treatment of lymphocytopenia are directed at the underlying cause of the change in cell counts.

### Proliferative disorders

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=White_blood_cell&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Proliferative disorders")]

An increase in the number of white blood cells in [circulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system "Circulatory system") is called [leukocytosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukocytosis "Leukocytosis").[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell#cite_note-Al2010-18) This increase is most commonly caused by [inflammation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation "Inflammation").[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell#cite_note-Al2010-18) There are four major causes: increase of production in bone marrow, increased release from storage in bone marrow, decreased attachment to veins and arteries, decreased uptake by tissues.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell#cite_note-Al2010-18) Leukocytosis may affect one or more cell lines and can be neutrophilic, eosinophilic, basophilic, monocytosis, or lymphocytosis.

Neutrophilia is an increase in the absolute neutrophil count in the [peripheral circulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_circulation "Systemic circulation"). Normal blood values vary by age.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell#cite_note-Williamshematology2010-19) Neutrophilia can be caused by a direct problem with blood cells (primary disease). It can also occur as a consequence of an underlying disease (secondary). Most cases of neutrophilia are secondary to inflammation.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell#cite_note-Schafer_a-21)

Primary causes[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell#cite_note-Schafer_a-21)

*   Conditions with normally functioning neutrophils – [hereditary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hereditary "Hereditary") neutrophilia, chronic [idiopathic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic "Idiopathic") neutrophilia

*   [Surgical removal of spleen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splenectomy "Splenectomy")[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell#cite_note-22)

Secondary causes[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell#cite_note-Schafer_a-21)

*   [Infection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection "Infection")
*   Chronic [inflammation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation "Inflammation") – especially [juvenile idiopathic arthritis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juvenile_idiopathic_arthritis "Juvenile idiopathic arthritis"), [rheumatoid arthritis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatoid_arthritis "Rheumatoid arthritis"), [Still's disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult-onset_Still%27s_disease "Adult-onset Still's disease"), [Crohn's disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crohn%27s_disease "Crohn's disease"), [ulcerative colitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcerative_colitis "Ulcerative colitis"), [granulomatous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granulomatous "Granulomatous") infections (for example, [tuberculosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis "Tuberculosis")), and chronic [hepatitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis "Hepatitis")
*   [Cigarette smoking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigarette_smoking "Cigarette smoking") – occurs in 25–50% of chronic smokers and can last up to 5 years after quitting
*   Stress – exercise, surgery, general stress
*   Medication induced – [corticosteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucocorticoids "Glucocorticoids") (for example, [prednisone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prednisone "Prednisone"), β-agonists, [lithium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium "Lithium"))
*   Cancer – either by [growth factors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor "Growth factor") secreted by the tumor or invasion of bone marrow by the cancer
*   Increased destruction of cells in [peripheral circulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_circulation "Systemic circulation") can stimulate bone marrow. This can occur in [hemolytic anemia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemolytic_anemia "Hemolytic anemia") and [idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic_thrombocytopenic_purpura "Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura")

A normal eosinophil count is considered to be less than 0.65×10 9/L.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell#cite_note-Williamshematology2010-19) Eosinophil counts are higher in newborns and vary with age, time (lower in the morning and higher at night), exercise, environment, and exposure to allergens.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell#cite_note-Williamshematology2010-19) Eosinophilia is never a normal lab finding. Efforts should always be made to discover the underlying cause, though the cause may not always be found.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell#cite_note-Williamshematology2010-19)

Counting and reference ranges
-----------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=White_blood_cell&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Counting and reference ranges")]

The [complete blood cell count](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_blood_count "Complete blood count") is a [blood panel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_panel "Blood panel") that includes the overall white blood cell count and [differential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell_differential "White blood cell differential") count, a count of each type of white blood cell. [Reference ranges for blood tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_ranges_for_blood_tests "Reference ranges for blood tests") specify the typical counts in healthy people.

The normal total leucocyte count in an adult is 4000 to 11,000 per mm 3 of blood.

Differential leucocyte count: number/ (%) of different types of leucocytes per cubic mm. of blood. Below are reference ranges for various types leucocytes.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell#cite_note-23)
