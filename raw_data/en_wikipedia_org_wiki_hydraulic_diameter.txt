Using this term, one can calculate many things in the same way as for a round tube. When the cross-section is uniform along the tube or channel length, it is defined as [ 1 ] [ 2 ] D H = 4 A P , {\displaystyle D_{\text{H}}={\frac {4A}{P}},} where A is the cross-sectional area of the flow, P is the wetted perimeter of the cross-section.

More intuitively, the hydraulic diameter can be understood as a function of the hydraulic radius R H , which is defined as the cross-sectional area of the channel divided by the wetted perimeter. Here, the wetted perimeter includes all surfaces acted upon by shear stress from the fluid.

[ 3 ] R H = A P , {\displaystyle R_{\text{H}}={\frac {A}{P}},} D H = 4 R H , {\displaystyle D_{\text{H}}=4R_{\text{H}},} Note that for the case of a circular pipe, D H = 4 π π R 2 2 π π R = 2 R {\displaystyle D_{\text{H}}={\frac {4\pi R^{2}}{2\pi R}}=2R} The need for the hydraulic diameter arises due to the use of a single dimension in the case of a dimensionless quantity such as the Reynolds number , which prefers a single variable for flow analysis rather than the set of variables as listed in the table below. The Manning formula contains a quantity called the hydraulic radius . Despite what the name may suggest, the hydraulic diameter is not twice the hydraulic radius, but four times larger.

Hydraulic diameter is mainly used for calculations involving turbulent flow .

Secondary flows can be observed in non-circular ducts as a result of turbulent shear stress in the turbulent flow. Hydraulic diameter is also used in calculation of heat transfer in internal-flow problems.

[ 4 ] Non-uniform and non-circular cross-section channels [ edit ] In the more general case, channels with non-uniform non-circular cross-sectional area, such as the Tesla valve , the hydraulic diameter is defined as: [ 5 ] D H = 4 V S , {\displaystyle D_{\text{H}}={\frac {4V}{S}},} where V is the total wetted volume of the channel, S is the total wetted surface area.

This definition is reduced to 4 A P {\displaystyle {\frac {4A}{P}}} for uniform non-circular cross-section  channels, and 2 R {\displaystyle 2R} for circular pipes.

List of hydraulic diameters [ edit ] Geometry Hydraulic diameter Comment Circular tube D H = 4 ⋅ ⋅ π π D 2 4 π π D = D {\displaystyle D_{\text{H}}={\frac {4\cdot {\frac {\pi D^{2}}{4}}}{\pi D}}=D} For a circular tube the hydraulic diameter is simply the diameter of the tube.

Annulus D H = 4 ⋅ ⋅ π π ( D out 2 − − D in 2 ) 4 π π ( D out + D in ) = D out − − D in {\displaystyle D_{\text{H}}={\frac {4\cdot {\frac {\pi (D_{\text{out}}^{2}-D_{\text{in}}^{2})}{4}}}{\pi (D_{\text{out}}+D_{\text{in}})}}=D_{\text{out}}-D_{\text{in}}} Square duct D H = 4 a 2 4 a = a {\displaystyle D_{\text{H}}={\frac {4a^{2}}{4a}}=a} here a represents the length of a side, not the cross sectional area Rectangular duct (fully filled). The duct is closed so that the wetted perimeter consists of the 4 sides of the duct.

D H = 4 a b 2 ( a + b ) = 2 a b a + b {\displaystyle D_{\text{H}}={\frac {4ab}{2(a+b)}}={\frac {2ab}{a+b}}} For the limiting case of a very wide duct, i.e. a slot of width b , where b ≫ a , then D H = 2 a .

Channel of water or partially filled rectangular duct. Open from top by definition so that the wetted perimeter consists of the 3 sides of the duct (2 on the side and the base).

D H = 4 a b 2 a + b {\displaystyle D_{\text{H}}={\frac {4ab}{2a+b}}} For the limiting case of a very wide duct, i.e. a slot of width b , where b ≫ a , and a is the water depth, then D H = 4 a .

For a fully filled duct or pipe whose cross-section is a convex regular polygon , the hydraulic diameter is equivalent to the diameter D {\displaystyle D} of a circle inscribed within the wetted perimeter .
This can be seen as follows: The N {\displaystyle N} -sided regular polygon is a union of N {\displaystyle N} triangles, each of height D / 2 {\displaystyle D/2} and base B = D tan ⁡ ⁡ ( π π / N ) {\displaystyle B=D\tan(\pi /N)} .
Each such triangle contributes B D / 4 {\displaystyle BD/4} to the total area and B {\displaystyle B} to the total perimeter, giving D H = 4 N B D / 4 N B = D {\displaystyle D_{\text{H}}=4{\frac {NBD/4}{NB}}=D} for the hydraulic diameter.
