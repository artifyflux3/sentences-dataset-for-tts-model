He was famous for his scientific studies of the eruptions of Mount Vesuvius , for his  researches on earthquakes and meteorological phenomena and for improving the seismograph of the time.

[ 1 ] Biography [ edit ] Palmieri was born in Faicchio , Benevento, Italy and died in Naples , Italy at the age of 89.

Palmieri received a degree in physics from the University of Naples . In 1845, he was made Professor of Physics at the Royal Naval School in Naples and in 1847 was appointed as Chair of Physics at the university. In 1848, he began working at the Vesuvius Observatory and in 1854  was appointed as Director of the Observatory. Using an electromagnetic seismometer for the detection and measurement of ground tremors ,  Palmieri was able to detect very slight movements in trying to predict volcanic  eruptions. Furthermore, he was the first to detect the presence of Helium on Earth on the lava of Mount Vesuvius.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] Using a modified Peltier electrometer , he also carried out research in the field of atmospheric electricity . Other scientific contributions included the development of a modified Morse telegraph , and improvements to the anemometer and pluviometer .

Raccolsi alcun tempo fa una sostanza amorfa di consistenza butirracea e di colore giallo sbiadato sublimata sull'orlo di una fumarola prossima alla bocca di eruzione. Saggiata questa sublimazione allo spettroscopio, ho ravvisato le righe del sodio e del potassio ed una lineare ben distinta che corrisponde esattamente alla D 3 che è quella dell'Helium. Do per ora il semplice annunzio del fatto, proponendomi di ritornare sopra questo argomento, dopo di aver sottoposta la sublimazione ad una analisi chimica.

(I collected some time ago an amorphous substance having a buttery consistency and a faded yellow color which had sublimated on the rim of a fumarole near the mouth of the eruption. Having analyzed this sublimated substance with a spectroscope, I recognized the lines of sodium and potassium and a very distinct linear line which corresponds exactly to D 3 , which is that of helium. For the present, I'm making a mere announcement of the fact, proposing to return to this subject after having subjected the sublimate to a chemical analysis.) ^ Stewart, Alfred Walter (2008).
