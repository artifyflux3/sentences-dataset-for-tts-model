In the following perspective projections , cube is 3-cube and tesseract is 4-cube.

In geometry , a hypercube is an n -dimensional analogue of a square ( n = 2 ) and a cube ( n = 3 ); the special case for n = 4 is known as a tesseract . It is a closed , compact , convex figure whose 1- skeleton consists of groups of opposite parallel line segments aligned in each of the space's dimensions , perpendicular to each other and of the same length.  A unit hypercube's longest diagonal in n dimensions is equal to n {\displaystyle {\sqrt {n}}} .

An n -dimensional hypercube is more commonly referred to as an n -cube or sometimes as an n -dimensional cube .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] The term measure polytope (originally from Elte, 1912) [ 3 ] is also used, notably in the work of H. S. M. Coxeter who also labels the hypercubes the γ n polytopes.

[ 4 ] The hypercube is the special case of a hyperrectangle (also called an n-orthotope ).

A unit hypercube is a hypercube whose side has length one unit .  Often, the hypercube whose corners (or vertices ) are the 2 n points in R n with each coordinate equal to 0 or 1 is called the unit hypercube.

Construction [ edit ] By the number of dimensions [ edit ] An animation showing how to create a tesseract from a point.

A hypercube can be defined by increasing the numbers of dimensions of a shape: 0 – A point is a hypercube of dimension zero.

1 – If one moves this point one unit length, it will sweep out a line segment, which is a unit hypercube of dimension one.

2 – If one moves this line segment its length in a perpendicular direction from itself; it sweeps out a 2-dimensional square.

3 – If one moves the square one unit length in the direction perpendicular to the plane it lies on, it will generate a 3-dimensional cube.

4 – If one moves the cube one unit length into the fourth dimension, it generates a 4-dimensional unit hypercube (a unit tesseract ).

This can be generalized to any number of dimensions. This process of sweeping out volumes can be formalized mathematically as a Minkowski sum : the d -dimensional hypercube is the Minkowski sum of d mutually perpendicular unit-length line segments, and is therefore an example of a zonotope .

The 1-skeleton of a hypercube is a hypercube graph .

Vertex coordinates [ edit ] Projection of a rotating tesseract .

A unit hypercube of dimension n {\displaystyle n} is the convex hull of all the 2 n {\displaystyle 2^{n}} points whose n {\displaystyle n} Cartesian coordinates are each equal to either 0 {\displaystyle 0} or 1 {\displaystyle 1} . These points are its vertices . The hypercube with these coordinates is also the cartesian product [ 0 , 1 ] n {\displaystyle [0,1]^{n}} of n {\displaystyle n} copies of the unit interval [ 0 , 1 ] {\displaystyle [0,1]} . Another unit hypercube, centered at the origin of the ambient space, can be obtained from this one by a translation . It is the convex hull of the 2 n {\displaystyle 2^{n}} points whose vectors of Cartesian coordinates are ( ± ± 1 2 , ± ± 1 2 , ⋯ ⋯ , ± ± 1 2 ) .

{\displaystyle \left(\pm {\frac {1}{2}},\pm {\frac {1}{2}},\cdots ,\pm {\frac {1}{2}}\right)\!.} Here the symbol ± ± {\displaystyle \pm } means that each coordinate is either equal to 1 / 2 {\displaystyle 1/2} or to − − 1 / 2 {\displaystyle -1/2} . This unit hypercube is also the cartesian product [ − − 1 / 2 , 1 / 2 ] n {\displaystyle [-1/2,1/2]^{n}} . Any unit hypercube has an edge length of 1 {\displaystyle 1} and an n {\displaystyle n} -dimensional volume of 1 {\displaystyle 1} .

The n {\displaystyle n} -dimensional hypercube obtained as the convex hull of the points with coordinates ( ± ± 1 , ± ± 1 , ⋯ ⋯ , ± ± 1 ) {\displaystyle (\pm 1,\pm 1,\cdots ,\pm 1)} or, equivalently as the Cartesian product [ − − 1 , 1 ] n {\displaystyle [-1,1]^{n}} is also often considered due to the simpler form of its vertex coordinates. Its edge length is 2 {\displaystyle 2} , and its n {\displaystyle n} -dimensional volume is 2 n {\displaystyle 2^{n}} .

Faces [ edit ] Every hypercube admits, as its faces, hypercubes of a lower dimension contained in its boundary. A hypercube of dimension n {\displaystyle n} admits 2 n {\displaystyle 2n} facets, or faces of dimension n − − 1 {\displaystyle n-1} : a ( 1 {\displaystyle 1} -dimensional) line segment has 2 {\displaystyle 2} endpoints; a ( 2 {\displaystyle 2} -dimensional) square has 4 {\displaystyle 4} sides or edges; a 3 {\displaystyle 3} -dimensional cube has 6 {\displaystyle 6} square faces; a ( 4 {\displaystyle 4} -dimensional) tesseract has 8 {\displaystyle 8} three-dimensional cubes as its facets. The number of vertices of a hypercube of dimension n {\displaystyle n} is 2 n {\displaystyle 2^{n}} (a usual, 3 {\displaystyle 3} -dimensional cube has 2 3 = 8 {\displaystyle 2^{3}=8} vertices, for instance).

[ 5 ] The number of the m {\displaystyle m} -dimensional hypercubes (just referred to as m {\displaystyle m} -cubes from here on) contained in the boundary of an n {\displaystyle n} -cube is E m , n = 2 n − − m ( n m ) {\displaystyle E_{m,n}=2^{n-m}{n \choose m}} , [ 6 ] where ( n m ) = n !

m !

( n − − m ) !

{\displaystyle {n \choose m}={\frac {n!}{m!\,(n-m)!}}} and n !

{\displaystyle n!} denotes the factorial of n {\displaystyle n} .

For example, the boundary of a 4 {\displaystyle 4} -cube ( n = 4 {\displaystyle n=4} ) contains 8 {\displaystyle 8} cubes ( 3 {\displaystyle 3} -cubes), 24 {\displaystyle 24} squares ( 2 {\displaystyle 2} -cubes), 32 {\displaystyle 32} line segments ( 1 {\displaystyle 1} -cubes) and 16 {\displaystyle 16} vertices ( 0 {\displaystyle 0} -cubes). This identity can be proven by a simple combinatorial argument: for each of the 2 n {\displaystyle 2^{n}} vertices of the hypercube, there are ( n m ) {\displaystyle {\tbinom {n}{m}}} ways to choose a collection of m {\displaystyle m} edges incident to that vertex. Each of these collections defines one of the m {\displaystyle m} -dimensional faces incident to the considered vertex. Doing this for all the vertices of the hypercube, each of the m {\displaystyle m} -dimensional faces of the hypercube is counted 2 m {\displaystyle 2^{m}} times since it has that many vertices, and we need to divide 2 n ( n m ) {\displaystyle 2^{n}{\tbinom {n}{m}}} by this number.

The number of facets of the hypercube can be used to compute the ( n − − 1 ) {\displaystyle (n-1)} -dimensional volume of its boundary: that volume is 2 n {\displaystyle 2n} times the volume of a ( n − − 1 ) {\displaystyle (n-1)} -dimensional hypercube; that is, 2 n s n − − 1 {\displaystyle 2ns^{n-1}} where s {\displaystyle s} is the length of the edges of the hypercube.

These numbers can also be generated by the linear recurrence relation .

E m , n = 2 E m , n − − 1 + E m − − 1 , n − − 1 {\displaystyle E_{m,n}=2E_{m,n-1}+E_{m-1,n-1}\!} ,     with E 0 , 0 = 1 {\displaystyle E_{0,0}=1} , and E m , n = 0 {\displaystyle E_{m,n}=0} when n < m {\displaystyle n<m} , n < 0 {\displaystyle n<0} , or m < 0 {\displaystyle m<0} .

For example, extending a square via its 4 vertices adds one extra line segment (edge) per vertex. Adding the opposite square to form a cube provides E 1 , 3 = 12 {\displaystyle E_{1,3}=12} line segments.

The extended f-vector for an n -cube can also be computed by expanding ( 2 x + 1 ) n {\displaystyle (2x+1)^{n}} (concisely, (2,1) n ), and reading off the coefficients of the resulting polynomial . For example, the elements of a tesseract is (2,1) 4 = (4,4,1) 2 = (16,32,24,8,1).

[ 8 ] The hypercube family is one of three regular polytope families, labeled by Coxeter as γ n . The other two are the hypercube dual family, the cross-polytopes , labeled as β n, and the simplices , labeled as α n . A fourth family, the infinite tessellations of hypercubes , is labeled as δ n .

Another related family of semiregular and uniform polytopes is the demihypercubes , which are constructed from hypercubes with alternate vertices deleted and simplex facets added in the gaps, labeled as hγ n .

n -cubes can be combined with their duals (the cross-polytopes ) to form compound polytopes: In two dimensions, we obtain the octagrammic star figure {8/2}, In three dimensions we obtain the compound of cube and octahedron , In four dimensions we obtain the compound of tesseract and 16-cell.

Relation to ( n −1)-simplices [ edit ] The graph of the n -hypercube's edges is isomorphic to the Hasse diagram of the ( n −1)- simplex 's face lattice . This can be seen by orienting the n -hypercube so that two opposite vertices lie vertically, corresponding to the ( n −1)-simplex itself and the null polytope, respectively. Each vertex connected to the top vertex then uniquely maps to one of the ( n −1)-simplex's facets ( n −2 faces), and each vertex connected to those vertices maps to one of the simplex's n −3 faces, and so forth, and the vertices connected to the bottom vertex map to the simplex's vertices.

This relation may be used to generate the face lattice of an ( n −1)-simplex efficiently, since face lattice enumeration algorithms applicable to general polytopes are more computationally expensive.

Generalized hypercubes [ edit ] Regular complex polytopes can be defined in complex Hilbert space called generalized hypercubes , γ p n = p {4} 2 {3}...

2 {3} 2 , or ..

. Real solutions exist with p = 2, i.e. γ 2 n = γ n = 2 {4} 2 {3}...

2 {3} 2 = {4,3,..,3}. For p > 2, they exist in C n {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} ^{n}} . The facets are generalized ( n −1)-cube and the vertex figure are regular simplexes .

The regular polygon perimeter seen in these orthogonal projections is called a Petrie polygon . The generalized squares ( n = 2) are shown with edges outlined as red and blue alternating color p -edges, while the higher n -cubes are drawn with black outlined p -edges.

The number of m -face elements in a p -generalized n -cube are: p n − − m ( n m ) {\displaystyle p^{n-m}{n \choose m}} . This is p n vertices and pn facets.

For example, the exponent 2 will yield a square number or "perfect square", which can be arranged into a square shape with a side length corresponding to that of the base. Similarly, the exponent 3 will yield a perfect cube , an integer which can be arranged into a cube shape with a side length of the base. As a result, the act of raising a number to 2 or 3 is more commonly referred to as " squaring " and "cubing", respectively. However, the names of higher-order hypercubes do not appear to be in common use for higher powers.
