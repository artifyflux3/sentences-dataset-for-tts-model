( December 2014 ) The COSPAR International Reference Atmosphere (CIRA) is an empirical model of the atmosphere of Earth. It consists of a set of tables of average air pressures , altitudes and temperatures . The CIRA models are developed by the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR) and have been important for the planning of spaceflight.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] History [ edit ] Orbit determinations and flight planning of the very first satellites proved to be more complicated than expected due to a lack of knowledge on the upper atmosphere . The Committee on Space Research therefore set up a long lasting special project to elaborate a reference model of the  most important parameters of the upper atmosphere. The first CIRA appeared 1961 as "CIRA1961". It was a set of tables reconsidered year for year by the Task Group on the CIRA originally chaired by Hildegard Kallmann-Bijl .

Today [ edit ] Presently "CIRA 1986" or CIRA-86 covers the height range up to 120 km as a set of tables. In the thermosphere, above about 100 km, CIRA-86 is identical to the more complicated NASA MSIS-86 model. All models are now available on the Web. The task group takes account of more recent data at bi-annual meetings in connection to COSPAR meeting.

The most recent version is the "CIRA 2014".
