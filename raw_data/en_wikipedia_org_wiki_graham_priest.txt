Life [ edit ] Priest was educated at St John's College, Cambridge [ 3 ] and the London School of Economics . His thesis advisor was John Lane Bell . He also holds a DLitt from the University of Melbourne .

[ 4 ] Priest was elected a corresponding fellow of the Australian Academy of the Humanities in 1995.

[ 5 ] In addition to his work in philosophy and logic, Priest practised karate-do . He is 3rd dan, International Karate-do Shobukai; 4th dan, shitō-ryū , and an Australian National kumite referee and kata judge. Presently, he practices tai chi .

[ citation needed ] Philosophical work [ edit ] Priest is known for his defence of dialetheism , his in-depth analyses of the logical paradoxes (holding the thesis that there is a uniform treatment for many well-known paradoxes, such as the semantic, set-theoretic and liar paradoxes ), and his many writings related to paraconsistent and other non-classical logics . In these he draws on the history of philosophy, including Asian philosophy .

Priest, a long-time resident of Australia, now residing in New York City, is the author of numerous books (most notably the textbook An Introduction to Non-Classical Logic ), and has published articles in nearly every major philosophical and logical journal. He was a frequent collaborator with the late Richard Sylvan , a fellow proponent of dialetheism and paraconsistent logic.

Priest has also published on metaphilosophy ( Beyond the Limits of Thought , 1995/2002).
