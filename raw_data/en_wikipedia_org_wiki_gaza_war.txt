Attacks on US bases during the Gaza war 2024 Erbil attack Tower 22 drone attack The Gaza war [ o ] is an armed conflict in the Gaza Strip and Israel , fought since 7 October 2023, as part of the unresolved Israeli–Palestinian and Gaza–Israel conflicts dating back to the 20th century. On 7 October 2023, Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups launched a surprise attack on Israel , in which 1,195 Israelis and foreign nationals, including 815 civilians, were killed, and 251 taken hostage with the stated goal of forcing Israel to release Palestinian prisoners . Since the start of the Israeli offensive that followed, over 61,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed , [ p ] almost half of them women and children , and more than 155,000 injured.

[ 78 ] [ 79 ] [ 18 ] A study in The Lancet estimated 64,260 deaths in Gaza from traumatic injuries by June 2024, while noting a potentially larger death toll when "indirect" deaths are included.

[ 14 ] [ 80 ] [ 81 ] [ 82 ] As of May 2025, a comparable figure for traumatic injury deaths would be 93,000.

[ 83 ] The Gaza war follows those of 2008–2009 , 2012 , 2014 , and the 2021 clashes . After clearing militants from its territory, Israel launched a bombing campaign and invaded Gaza on 27 October with the stated objectives of destroying Hamas and freeing the hostages.

Israeli forces launched numerous campaigns, including the Rafah offensive from May 2024, three battles fought around Khan Yunis , and the siege of North Gaza from October 2024, and have assassinated Hamas leaders inside and outside of Gaza.

A temporary ceasefire in November 2023 broke down, and a second ceasefire in January 2025 ended with a surprise attack by Israel in March 2025.

The war has resulted in a humanitarian crisis in Gaza .

Israel's tightened blockade of Gaza cut off basic necessities, causing a severe hunger crisis, malnutrition, and imminent famine as of July 2025 [update] .

[ 84 ] [ 85 ] [ 86 ] By early 2025, Israel had caused unprecedented destruction in Gaza and made large parts of it uninhabitable, [ 87 ] leveling entire cities [ 88 ] and destroying hospitals (including children's hospitals ), religious and cultural landmarks , [ 89 ] educational facilities , [ 90 ] [ 91 ] agricultural land , [ 92 ] and cemeteries .

[ 93 ] Gazan journalists , [ 94 ] health workers , [ 95 ] aid workers and other members of civil society have been detained , tortured and killed.

[ 96 ] Nearly all of the strip's 2.3 million Palestinian population have been forcibly displaced .

[ 97 ] [ 98 ] Over 100,000 Israelis were internally displaced at the height of the conflict.

[ 99 ] The first day was the deadliest in Israel's history, and the war is the deadliest for Palestinians in the broader conflict.

[ 100 ] Many human rights organizations and scholars of genocide studies and international law say that a genocide is taking place in Gaza , though some dispute this.

[ 101 ] [ 102 ] [ 103 ] [ 104 ] Experts and human rights organizations have also stated that Israel and Hamas have committed war crimes .

A case accusing Israel of committing genocide in Gaza is being reviewed by the International Court of Justice , while the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Benjamin Netanyahu , Yoav Gallant and Mohammed Deif , though Deif's was withdrawn because he was killed.

[ 105 ] Torture and sexual violence have been committed by Palestinian militant groups and by Israeli forces .

[ 106 ] Israel has received extensive military and diplomatic support from the United States , which has vetoed multiple pro-ceasefire resolutions from the UN Security Council .

[ 107 ] The war has reverberated regionally , with Axis of Resistance groups across several Arab countries and Iran clashing with the United States and Israel, including the 12-day Iran–Israel war .

A year of strikes between Israel and Hezbollah led to the Israeli invasion of Lebanon , the ongoing Israeli operations in Syria , as well as contributing to the fall of the Assad regime . The war continues to have significant regional and international repercussions, with large protests worldwide calling for a ceasefire, as well as a surge of antisemitism and anti-Palestinian racism .

Names The Gaza war is referred to by different names. Israel calls it the "Iron Swords war" ( Hebrew : מלחמת חרבות ברזל ).

[ 108 ] [ q ] It has also been referred to as the "Simchat Torah war", as the war started on the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah , reminiscent of the Yom Kippur War .

[ 111 ] Palestinian militant groups refer to it as the "battle of al-Aqsa Flood" ( Arabic : معركة طوفان الأقصى ), in reference to Operation al-Aqsa Flood .

[ 112 ] [ 113 ] Western media outlets have variably described it as the "Israel–Hamas war" [ 114 ] while others use "war on Gaza".

[ 115 ] Others have used the term "October 7 war", [ 116 ] [ 117 ] " Gaza genocide ", [ 118 ] [ 87 ] "second Nakba ", [ 119 ] or "Nakba 2023".

[ 120 ] [ 121 ] Background Main article: Background to the Gaza war Israeli and Palestinian deaths preceding the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel, of which most were civilians [ 49 ] [ 122 ] In the 1948 Palestine war , the Zionist movement culminated in the establishment of the State of Israel over most of what had been Mandatory Palestine , with the exception of two separated territories that became known as the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, which were held by Jordan and Egypt respectively. Following the 1967 Six-Day War , Israel occupied the Palestinian territories of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.

[ 123 ] The upcoming period witnessed two popular uprisings by Palestinians against the Israeli occupation ; the First and Second Intifadas in 1987 and 2000 respectively, [ 124 ] with the latter's end seeing Israel's unilateral withdrawal from Gaza in 2005.

[ 125 ] [ 126 ] Since 2007, the Gaza Strip has been governed by Hamas , an Islamist militant group, while the West Bank remained under the control of the Fatah -led Palestinian Authority . After Hamas's takeover, Israel imposed a blockade of the Gaza Strip [ 127 ] [ 128 ] that significantly damaged its economy .

[ 129 ] Israel justified the blockade by citing security concerns, [ 130 ] but international rights groups have characterized it as a form of collective punishment .

[ 131 ] [ 132 ] [ 133 ] By 2023, UNRWA reported that 81% of people were living below the poverty level , with 63% being food insecure and dependent on international assistance.

[ 122 ] [ 134 ] Since 2007, Israel and Hamas, along with other Palestinian militant groups based in Gaza, have engaged in conflict, [ 130 ] [ 128 ] [ 135 ] including in four wars: in 2008–2009 , 2012 , 2014 , and 2021 .

[ 136 ] [ 137 ] [ 138 ] Combined, these conflicts killed approximately 6,400 Palestinians and 300 Israelis .

[ 139 ] [ 49 ] [ 122 ] In 2018–2019, there were large weekly organized protests near the Gaza-Israel border to call for the right to return . The Israel Defense Forces violently suppressed the protests, killing hundreds and injuring thousands of Palestinians by sniper fire.

[ 140 ] [ 141 ] Soon after a short 2021 conflict occurred, Hamas's military wing, the Al-Qassam Brigades , started planning an operation against Israel, which became the 7 October attacks.

[ 142 ] [ 143 ] According to diplomats, Hamas had repeatedly said in the months leading up to October 2023 that it did not want another military escalation in Gaza as it would worsen the humanitarian crisis that occurred after the 2021 conflict.

[ 133 ] Hamas officials stated that the attack was a response to the Israeli occupation , blockade of the Gaza Strip , desecration of the Al-Aqsa Mosque , Israeli settler violence against Palestinians, restrictions on the movement of Palestinians , and imprisonment of thousands of Palestinians , whom Hamas sought to release by taking Israeli hostages.

[ 144 ] [ 145 ] [ 146 ] Numerous commentators have identified the broader context of Israeli occupation as a cause of the war.

[ 147 ] [ 148 ] [ 149 ] The Associated Press wrote that Palestinians are "in despair over a never-ending occupation in the West Bank and suffocating blockade of Gaza".

[ 150 ] Several human rights organizations, including Amnesty International , [ 151 ] B'Tselem [ 152 ] and Human Rights Watch [ 153 ] have likened the Israeli occupation to apartheid , although supporters of Israel dispute this characterization.

[ 154 ] [ 155 ] However, an advisory opinion by the International Court of Justice published in July 2024 affirmed the occupation as being illegal and said it violated Article 3 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination , which prohibits racial segregation and apartheid.

[ 156 ] The Netanyahu government has been criticized within Israel for granting work permits to Gazan residents , facilitating the transfer of funds to Hamas and pursuing relative calm. These actions have been criticized as having backfired in light of the attacks on 7 October 2023.

[ 157 ] [ 158 ] [ 159 ] US President Joe Biden has said the aim of the 7 October attacks was to disrupt the Saudi–Israel normalization talks .

7 October Hamas-led attack on Israel Main article: October 7 attacks See also: List of Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel in 2023 Clockwise from top : Approximate situation on 7–8 October A blood-stained floor in the aftermath of the Nahal Oz attack Aftermath of a Hamas airstrike on the maternity ward of the Barzilai Medical Center Satellite view of widespread fires in Israeli areas surrounding the Gaza Strip Footage of Israeli soldiers securing the area after the Nova music festival massacre In the morning of 7 October 2023, [ 161 ] during the Jewish holidays of Simchat Torah and Shemini Atzeret on Shabbat , [ 162 ] Hamas announced the start of what it called " Operation Al-Aqsa Flood ", firing between 3,000 and 5,000 rockets from the Gaza Strip into Israel within a span of 20 minutes, killing at least five people.

[ 163 ] [ 164 ] [ 165 ] In the evening, Hamas launched another barrage of 150 rockets towards Israel.

[ 164 ] Simultaneously, around 3,000 Hamas militants [ 33 ] infiltrated Israel from Gaza using trucks, motorcycles, bulldozers, speedboats, and paragliders.

[ 150 ] [ 161 ] [ 166 ] They took over checkpoints at Kerem Shalom and Erez , and created openings in the border fence in five other places.

[ 167 ] Militants massacred civilians in several kibbutzim , [ 168 ] [ 169 ] where they took hostages [ 170 ] and set fire to homes.

[ 171 ] In a massacre at an outdoor music festival near Re'im , at least 325 people were killed, with more injured or taken hostage.

[ 172 ] [ 173 ] In total, 251 people, mostly civilians, were taken hostage , including [ 174 ] [ 175 ] children, elderly people, and soldiers.

[ 176 ] Hamas militants also reportedly engaged in mutilation, torture, and sexual and gender-based violence .

[ 177 ] [ 178 ] [ 179 ] The 7 October attacks were described as "an intelligence failure for the ages" [ 180 ] and a " failure of imagination " on the part of the Israeli government.

[ 181 ] A BBC report commented on Hamas's "extraordinary levels of operational security".

[ 182 ] It later emerged that abnormal Hamas movements had been detected the previous day by Israeli intelligence, but the military's alert level was not raised and political leaders were not informed.

[ 183 ] A briefing in The Economist noted that "the assault dwarf[ed] all other mass murders of Israeli civilians", and that "the last time before October 7th that this many Jews were murdered on a single day was during the Holocaust ." [ 169 ] According to both Hamas officials and external observers, the attack was a calculated effort to create a "permanent" state of war and revive the Palestinian cause.

[ 184 ] [ 185 ] Initial Israeli counter-operation (October 2023) For a chronological guide, see Timeline of the Gaza war (7 October 2023 – 27 October 2023) .

[ 186 ] The first helicopters sent to support the military reached the Israeli areas surrounding the Gaza Strip an hour after the fighting began.

[ 172 ] Their crews encountered difficulties in determining which places were occupied by invading militants, and distinguishing between Israeli civilians, IDF soldiers, and Palestinian militants on the ground.

[ 172 ] A June 2024 UN report [ 187 ] [ 188 ] and a July 2024 Haaretz investigation revealed that the IDF ordered the Hannibal Directive to be used, killing an unknown number of Israeli civilians and soldiers.

[ 189 ] [ 190 ] [ 191 ] The attack was a complete surprise to the Israelis.

[ 192 ] In a televised broadcast, Benjamin Netanyahu , Prime Minister of Israel , announced that the country was at war.

[ 166 ] He threatened to "turn all the places where Hamas is organized and hiding into cities of ruins", called Gaza "the city of evil", and urged its residents to leave.

[ 193 ] [ 144 ] Overnight, Israel's Security Cabinet voted to act to bring about the "destruction of the military and governmental capabilities of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad ".

[ 194 ] The Israel Electric Corporation , which supplies 80% of the Gaza Strip's electricity, cut off power to the area.

[ 195 ] This reduced Gaza's power supply from 120 MW to 20 MW, provided by power plants paid for by the Palestinian Authority.

[ 196 ] The IDF declared a "state of readiness for war", [ 164 ] mobilized tens of thousands of army reservists , [ 161 ] [ 195 ] and declared a state of emergency for areas within 80 kilometers (50 mi) of Gaza.

[ 197 ] The Yamam counterterrorism unit was deployed, [ 198 ] along with four new divisions, augmenting 31 existing battalions.

[ 150 ] Reservists were reported deployed in Gaza, in the West Bank, and along borders with Lebanon and Syria.

[ 199 ] Residents near Gaza were asked to stay inside, while civilians in southern and central Israel were "required to stay next to shelters".

[ 195 ] The southern region of Israel was closed to civilian movement, [ 198 ] and roads were closed around Gaza [ 150 ] and Tel Aviv.

[ 195 ] While Ben Gurion Airport and Ramon Airport remained operational, multiple airlines cancelled flights to and from Israel.

[ 200 ] On 9 or 10 October, Hamas offered to release all civilian hostages held in Gaza if Israel would call off its planned invasion of the Gaza Strip, but the Israeli government rejected the offer.

[ 201 ] Blockade, bombardment, and evacuation of northern Gaza Main articles: 2023 Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip , Israeli bombing of the Gaza Strip , and Evacuation of the northern Gaza Strip See also: Attacks on Palestinians evacuating Gaza City and al-Ahli Arab Hospital explosion Clockwise from top : Doctors treat a Palestinian injured by an Israeli airstrike in Deir el-Balah, Gaza Strip Injured Palestinian children receiving treatment A newborn baby killed as a result of an Israeli airstrike People fleeing following an Israeli airstrike on a house in Deir el-Balah, Gaza Strip Video interviews conducted with several survivors of Israeli airstrikes in October 2023 Following the surprise attack, the Israeli Air Force conducted airstrikes that they said targeted Hamas targets, [ 164 ] [ 197 ] [ 202 ] employing its artificial intelligence Habsora ("The Gospel") software.

[ 203 ] [ 204 ] These airstrikes were killing, on average, 350 persons per day during the first 20 days, totaling over 7,000 deaths during that time.

[ 205 ] Israel also rescued two hostages before declaring a state of war for the first time since the 1973 Yom Kippur War .

[ 206 ] [ 207 ] On 9 October, Defense Minister Gallant announced a "complete siege" of the Gaza Strip, cutting off electricity and blocking the entry of food and fuel.

[ 208 ] This order drew criticism from Human Rights Watch (HRW) who described it as "abhorrent" and as a "call to commit a war crime".

[ 209 ] [ 210 ] Gallant backed down under pressure from US President Joe Biden , and a deal was struck ten days later to allow aid into Gaza.

[ 211 ] The first such aid convoy entered Gaza on 21 October, [ 212 ] while fuel did not arrive until November.

[ 213 ] On 13 October, the IDF ordered all civilians in Gaza City to evacuate to areas south of the Wadi Gaza [ 214 ] within 24 hours. The Hamas Authority for Refugee Affairs responded by telling residents in northern Gaza to defy those orders.

[ 215 ] The Israeli order was widely condemned as "outrageous" and "impossible", and calls were made for it to be reversed.

[ 216 ] As a part of the order, the IDF outlined a six-hour window on 13 October for refugees to flee south along specified routes.

[ 217 ] An explosion along one of the safe routes killed 70 Palestinians. Israel and Hamas blamed each other for the attack.

[ 218 ] The IDF said Hamas set up roadblocks to keep Gaza residents from evacuating.

[ 219 ] Israeli officials, foreign governments and intergovernmental organizations condemned Hamas's alleged use of hospitals and civilians as human shields , which has been contested by Amnesty International [ 220 ] and by Hamas themselves.

[ 221 ] [ 222 ] Israeli soldiers and Palestinians, as well as human rights groups, have also accused the IDF of similarly using human shields .

[ 223 ] [ 224 ] [ 225 ] On 17 October, Israel bombed areas of southern Gaza.

It claimed that the initial deal allowed Israel to resume war at any moment after 1 March if negotiations were deemed ineffective.

[ 432 ] Israel stated the attack was due to the refusal of Hamas to extend the first phase of the ceasefire by releasing more hostages, and was also in response to Hamas's rearming and reorganizing over the course of the two months of ceasefire.

[ 433 ] Hamas said that it had adhered to the ceasefire agreement, implementing it precisely, and that Israel had resumed aggression and war. Internationally, the strikes were seen to stymie hopes for a lasting ceasefire.

[ 371 ] On 27 May, the US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation began operations in Tel al-Sultan to deliver humanitarian aid. As thousands of starving Palestinians overwhelmed the distribution center, Israeli forces fired into the crowd, killing ten and injuring at least 62 Palestinians.

[ 477 ] In a series of subsequent attacks on aid seekers , more than 1,300 were killed.

[ 478 ] On 30 June, an Israeli airstrike on al-Baqa cafeteria killed at least 41 Palestinians—including photojournalist Ismail Abu Hatab —and injured another 75.

[ 479 ] On 19 June, the IDF announced that it killed Muhammad Nasser Ali Kanita, the senior Hamas militant who participated in the 7 October attacks and held Israeli-British hostage Emily Damari in his house at the beginning of the war.

[ 480 ] On 20 July, the IDF issued evacuation orders for the city of Deir al-Balah , where it had not launched a ground offensive since the start of the war.

[ 481 ] On the following day, Israeli forces advanced into the outskirts of Deir al-Balah as airstrikes hit the city.

[ 482 ] During this offensive, the IDF stated that it controlled 65% of territory in Gaza. However, Israeli journalist Yoav Zeitun argued that this figure was misleading, as it ignored the fact that in much of Gaza there is no IDF presence and that Hamas still acts as a governing body capable of controlling the territory and providing civilian services to the population.

[ 483 ] In early August 2025, the Israeli security cabinet approved a plan to occupy Gaza City. The plan drew international condemnation from the UN, Germany, the European Council president, the United Kingdom, Denmark, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and China. Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid called it "a disaster that will lead to many more disasters." Germany said it would suspend the approval of arms exports to Israel in response to the plan, and Norway said it would re-evaluate its sovereign wealth fund's investments in Israel.

[ 484 ] [ 485 ] On 10 August 2025, Israeli forces struck a press tent outside al-Shifa Hospital, killing six Al-Jazeera journalists including Anas Al-Sharif , [ 486 ] [ 487 ] bringing the total number of journalists killed by Israel during the war to 192.

[ 488 ] On 12 August 2025, the IDF announced that it had killed five militants in the Gaza Strip who had posed as aid workers for the World Central Kitchen. According to the IDF, they were killed in a targeted airstrike in the previous week after they deliberately attached the aid group's logo to their vehicles and wore yellow vests in an attempt to disguise their activities and avoid being targeted.

[ 489 ] World Central Kitchen confirmed that armed operatives had posed as its employees and condemned their actions.

[ 490 ] Post-war plans Israeli leaders' plans On 16 October 2023, the Israeli war cabinet defined four central goals for the war as outlined in the document: toppling the Hamas regime and dismantling its capabilities, remove the terrorist threat from Gaza, intensive action to return the hostages, and maintaining the security of Israel's borders and its residents.

[ 491 ] About a month after the start of the war, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that overall security responsibility for what happens in the Gaza Strip would rest with Israel after the war, for an indefinite period of time.

[ 492 ] In another interview, he said that the Strip was "demilitarized and under a civilian government, but a reliable force would be required to enter and kill the murderers so that an entity like Hamas would not emerge".

[ 493 ] He told the heads of the authorities in the western Negev that the IDF would continue to hold the Gaza Strip for a certain period after the war and that after the elimination of Hamas there would be overall Israeli security control over the Gaza Strip, including full demilitarization.

[ 494 ] On November 11, Netanyahu expressed opposition to the possibility of the Palestinian Authority assuming civilian control over the Strip.

[ 495 ] In response to a question about the possibility of returning Jewish settlement to the Strip in one form or another, he objected and said that he did not see this as a realistic goal.

[ 496 ] In February 2024, Netanyahu presented his proposal for the “Day After Hamas” to Security Cabinet of Israel . It included management by local people and was not rejected or approved by a vote at the cabinet.

[ 497 ] About 100 days after the start of the war, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant spoke of the need for a political-diplomatic decision and said that the end of the military campaign must be anchored in a political act. According to him, political thought guides the military action and the lack of a political decision could harm the progress of the military operation.

[ 498 ] About six months after the start of the war, it was reported that Netanyahu was preventing a strategic discussion on the goals of the war in light of its progress, contrary to the agreement reached in the war cabinet.

[ 499 ] On May 12 2024, it was reported that the IDF leadership was demanding that the prime minister make a decision on post war  issue.

[ 500 ] On May 15, Gallant convened a press conference in which he criticized Netanyahu for rejecting dealing with the post war issue in the Gaza Strip. Gallant called on Netanyahu to announce that Israel would not control Gaza, and expressed his opposition to a Israeli civilian and military government in the Strip. His remarks drew criticism from coalition and opposition figures, and were supported by the leader of the National Unity party, Benny Gantz .

[ 501 ] On 24 July, Netanyahu outlined his vision for the post-war Gaza Strip before the US Congress: "A demilitarized Gaza free of weapons and extremism. We do not want to settle in Gaza, but we will have to maintain security responsibility there. It should be run by Palestinians who do not want to destroy Israel. A new generation of Palestinians should learn no more to hate Jews but to live in peace with us. After our victory, with the help of partners in the region, the demilitarization of Gaza and the end of extremism in Gaza, we can bring about a future of peace and prosperity." [ 502 ] In February 2025, the leader of the Israeli opposition, Yair Lapid , proposed that Gaza be returned to Egypt for up to 15 years in exchange for the cancellation of its external debt. Egypt rejected the proposal stating it undermined the Palestinian cause.

[ 503 ] On 2 April, Israel Katz announced the Israeli government's intention to "seize large areas" of Gaza as large air and ground operations resumed following the end of the March ceasefire.

[ 504 ] On 17 April, Katz said that Israeli forces would remain in areas of Gaza, Lebanon and Syria indefinitely.

[ 505 ] On 5 May, the Israeli cabinet approved plans to capture the entire Gaza Strip and occupy it for an unspecified amount of time.

[ 506 ] Far-right Minister of Finance Bezalel Smotrich said that Gaza would be "entirely destroyed" in Israel's new offensive and that the population would be expelled to other countries.

[ 507 ] On 8 August 2025, the Security Cabinet approved five principles for ending the war, including disarming Hamas, returning all hostages, demilitarizing the Gaza Strip, maintaining Israeli security control over it, and establishing an alternative civilian government not affiliated with Hamas or the Palestinian Authority .

[ 508 ] Bezalel Smotrich then withdrew confidence in Netanyahu’s war leadership, criticizing his Gaza strategy as weak and calling for a decisive military victory over Hamas.

[ 509 ] Donald Trump's proposal Main article: Donald Trump's Gaza Strip proposal After the announcement of a second ceasefire in January 2025, Donald Trump announced his intention to displace the Palestinian population of Gaza , reiterating his position that they should be resettled in neighboring Arab countries three more times that month.

[ 510 ] Ahead of a 4 February meeting with Netanyahu, Trump specified his intention to permanently displace Gaza's Palestinian inhabitants, which would be in violation of international law. He proposed a US takeover of Gaza that evening during a press conference with Netanyahu.

[ 511 ] Trump insisted that neighboring countries would pay for Gaza's reconstruction and that "world people" would live there. He did not rule out deploying US troops if necessary. On 5 and 6 February, Trump aides and Trump himself walked back some of his comments, including his willingness to deploy US soldiers. On 10 February, Trump said that Palestinians who leave Gaza would have no right of return . In a meeting with King Abdullah II of Jordan , Trump said that the US would take rather than buy Gaza because "It's a war torn area. It's Gaza. There is nothing to buy." [ 512 ] Trump had proposed Jordan take in the displaced Palestinians from Gaza, which Jordanian foreign minister Ayman Safadi categorically rejected, stating "They don't want to come to Jordan and we don't want them to come to Jordan." [ 513 ] Trump's statements were met with condemnation from world leaders; however, in Israel, far-right national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir praised Trump, saying that Palestinian "migration" was the only solution to the war.

[ 514 ] Netanyahu and Ben-Gvir characterized the planned displacement of Gazans as a "voluntary migration", but communications minister Shlomo Karhi said the transfer will be forced rather than voluntary.

[ 515 ] Trump has rejected the Arab League plan claiming that "The current proposal does not address the reality that Gaza is currently uninhabitable and residents cannot humanely live in a territory covered in debris and unexploded ordnance ," and that the Trump administration will go ahead with seizing the territory "to bring peace and prosperity to the region".

[ 516 ] In May 2025, US special envoy Steve Witkoff proposed a ceasefire in Gaza. This proposal reportedly included a 60-day truce, freeing of 28 hostages, release of over 1000 Palestinian prisoners and supply of humanitarian aid. Israel accepted the proposal. Hamas requested amendments to the plan and reiterated calls for the complete withdrawal of the IDF from Gaza.

[ 517 ] Arab League proposal Arab governments rejected Trump's transfer plan, instead backing an Egyptian proposal. The Arab League , meeting on 4 March in Cairo, devised a $53bn plan detailing the reconstruction of Gaza while keeping its population in place.

[ 518 ] The proposal also included the requirement that Hamas disarm, step down and fresh elections to a reformed Palestinian Authority be held.

[ 516 ] Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune boycotted the league meeting claiming that it was "monopolized by a limited and narrow group of Arab countries" namely the Arab states of the Persian Gulf .

[ 516 ] Hamas also reiterated that the group's arms were non-negotiable and rejected the plan.

[ 516 ] Others In March 2025, the United States and Israel said they have contacted officials from Egypt , Jordan , Sudan , Syria , Morocco , Puntland , and Somaliland to discuss the resettlement of Gaza residents in their territories.

[ 519 ] [ 520 ] [ 521 ] Egypt, [ 522 ] Jordan, [ 513 ] and Sudan, [ 523 ] rejected the proposal while Somalia and Somaliland denied that they had been con tacted.

[ 524 ] In May 2025, reports emerged that the Trump administration was working on a plan to permanently relocate 1 million Gazans to Libya , while offering the release of around $30 billion in funds frozen by the US since the toppling of the regime of Muammar Gaddafi in exchange for Libyan authorities agreeing to the deal.

[ 525 ] [ 526 ] In August 2025, reports suggested that Nethanyahu was in talks with South Sudan to discuss the resettlement of Gaza residents.

[ 527 ] [ 528 ] [ 529 ] The plan allegedly involved Israel, USA and the UAE 's backing and would see financial and diplomatic support. However, whilst the South Sudanese cabinet actually agreed to the deal, it fell short in parliament and other parts of the South Sudanese government.

[ 528 ] South Sudan later officially refused to hold broader talks on the subject with Israel.

[ 529 ] On 9 April, French president Emmanuel Macron said that France could recognize a Palestinian state by June, adding that he wanted to be part of a collective dynamic where those who defend Palestine also recognize Israel in turn.

The war's spillover has resulted in a major escalation of existing tensions between Israel and Iran, with groups in the Axis of Resistance launching attacks on American military bases , and the Yemeni Houthi movement attacking commercial vessels in the Red Sea and incurring a US-led military operation .

[ 531 ] Hezbollah in southern Lebanon and the Houthi movement in Yemen launched attacks against Israel shortly after the start of the war. Iranian-backed militias in Iraq and Syria have also traded attacks with the US and IDF.

[ 532 ] Israel has bombed targets in and around Damascus throughout the war, [ 533 ] [ 534 ] [ 535 ] with an attack on the Iranian embassy in Damascus on 1 April 2024 leading to a series of retaliatory airstrikes on Israel in response.

[ 536 ] [ 537 ] On 31 July, Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in Tehran , where he had traveled to attend the inauguration of President Masoud Pezeshkian , [ 538 ] and on 1 October, Iran fired approximately 200 missiles at Israel.

[ 539 ] [ 540 ] By the end of 2024, a year-long exchange of strikes between Israel and Hezbollah escalated into an Israeli invasion of Lebanon , before it was paused after a ceasefire .

[ 541 ] Under the November 2024 agreement, Israeli forces were to withdraw from Lebanon by January 2025, but Israel refused and the deadline was extended to February 2025, where Israel withdrew its forces from Lebanese villages but kept Israeli forces maintaining five military outposts on highlands in Southern Lebanon, against Lebanon's wishes.

[ 542 ] [ 543 ] The crisis has also seen the fall of the Assad regime and an ongoing Israeli invasion of Syria .

[ 544 ] [ 545 ] Israeli defense minister Israel Katz in April 2025 declared that Israeli forces would indefinitely remain in "security zones" that they "cleared and seized" in Gaza, Lebanon and Syria.

[ 546 ] West Bank and Israel Further information: Israeli incursions in the West Bank during the Gaza war , 2023 Givat Shaul shooting , and 2024 Kiryat Malakhi attack West Bank sector of war West Bank Palestinian enclaves ( Areas A & B ) West Bank under Israeli control ( Area C ) Israeli-annexed East Jerusalem Amnesty International released a report [ 547 ] on 5 February 2024 stating that Israel is carrying out unlawful killings in the West Bank and displaying "a chilling disregard for Palestinian lives" and that Israeli forces are carrying out numerous illegal acts of violence that constitute clear violations of international law.

[ 548 ] [ 549 ] Before the war, 2023 was the deadliest year for Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank in 20 years. Violence in the West Bank has increased since the war began with more than 607 Palestinians and over 25 Israelis killed.

[ 550 ] [ 551 ] At the same time, Israeli settler violence further increased to around 1,270 attacks, against 856 for all of 2022.

[ 552 ] About 1,000 Palestinians have been forcibly displaced by settlers since 7 October and almost half of the clashes have included "Israeli forces accompanying or actively supporting Israeli settlers while carrying out the attacks" according to a U.N. report.

[ 553 ] According to the West Bank Protection Consortium, since the 7 October attacks six Palestinian communities have been abandoned due to the violence.

[ 554 ] On 19 October, more than 60 Hamas members were arrested and 12 people were killed in overnight Israeli raids across the West Bank. Those arrested included the movement's spokesperson in the West Bank, Hassan Yousef .

[ 555 ] In July, Israeli authorities approved the seizure of 12.7 square kilometers of land in the occupied West Bank. According to Peace Now , this was the largest single appropriation approved since the 1993 Oslo accords." [ 556 ] Israeli authorities also approved plans for almost 5,300 new houses in occupied West Bank.

[ 557 ] By July 2024, Israeli land seizures exceeded the combined total of the previous 20 years.

[ 558 ] The following month, the Israeli government approved new settlements in the occupied West Bank, [ 559 ] [ 560 ] and it was reported that Israeli settlers had taken advantage of the ongoing war to expand settlement activity supported by a far-right Israeli government , [ 561 ] [ 552 ] [ 562 ] including land seizure and large scale settlement plans.

[ 563 ] On 7 August, Wafa reported that Israeli forces destroyed the regional headquarters of Fatah in the Balata Camp .

[ 564 ] [ 565 ] On 28 August, Israel launched the largest military operation into the northern West Bank in more than 20 years. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said that the operation was a "full-fledged war".

[ 566 ] Israeli forces carried out simultaneous operations in Jenin, Tubas, Nablus, Ramallah and Tulkarem. In Jenin, Israeli forces destroyed the city's infrastructure and carried out mass arrests of men and boys. Civilians were trapped in their homes and denied access to food, water and medicine. Members of the press were denied access to the city and the army blocked access to hospitals and ambulances.

[ 567 ] A day later, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres called for a halt to the operations, [ 568 ] and EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the operations "must not constitute the premises of a war extension from Gaza, including full-scale destruction." [ 569 ] On 3 September, Israeli media reported that the IDF had classified the West Bank as a "combat zone" and now viewed it as the second most important front in the war.

[ 570 ] [ 571 ] Yoav Gallant said that Israel was " mowing the lawn " with its West Bank operations, but that it would eventually need to "pull out the roots".

[ 572 ] On 6 September, Turkish-American protestor Ayşenur Eygi was killed by an Israeli sniper at a demonstration near Nablus.

[ 573 ] On 3 October, an Israeli airstrike in Tulkarm Camp killed at least 20 people.

[ 574 ] [ 575 ] On 13 November, Israeli far-right finance minister Bezalel Smotrich said that with Donald Trump 's victory in the 2024 United States presidential election , Israel was "a step away" from "sovereignty in Judea and Samaria." Later comments by Mike Huckabee , chosen by Trump as the next ambassador to Israel, corroborated the possibility of an Israeli annexation of the West Bank.

[ 576 ] On 21 January 2025, the IDF said it launched a major raid in West Bank.

[ 577 ] [ 578 ] On 29 January, the IDF said that it conducted a drone strike targeting a group of militants in Tammun , killing at least 10 people.

[ 579 ] [ 580 ] [ 581 ] Attacks in Israel On 30 November, two Palestinian gunmen killed three and wounded 11 Israeli civilians at a bus stop on the Givat Shaul Interchange in Jerusalem. Hamas claimed responsibility.

[ 582 ] On 16 February 2024, a Palestinian gunman shot and killed two Israeli civilians and injured four others in Kiryat Malakhi , Israel. The shooter was killed by an off-duty IDF reservist at the scene.

[ 583 ] On 12 April, a 14-year-old Israeli shepherd went missing near Ramallah and was found dead a day later. On 15 April, two Palestinians were killed by Israeli settlers in Aqraba .

[ 584 ] On 13 May, at the Tarqumiya checkpoint, a convoy of trucks carrying food supplies to Gaza was attacked by Israeli settlers, who damaged the trucks and threw supplies on the ground.

[ 585 ] Israeli prisons and detention camps Israel has increased its administrative detention of Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza, as well as Palestinian citizens of Israel, since the start of the war. Administrative detention was already at a 20-year high before October 2023.

[ 586 ] More than 11,000 Palestinians are held in Israeli jails, not counting detainees taken from Gaza during the war.

[ 587 ] At least 60 Palestinians have died in Israeli detention since 7 October.

[ 588 ] They are held without charge or trial, which violates international law.

[ 589 ] In December 2023, a military base at Sde Teiman in the Negev Desert was converted to a detention camp by the IDF. Whistleblowers and detainees reported beatings and torture of Palestinian detainees at the camp, as well as amputations of limbs due to injuries sustained from handcuffing, medical neglect, arbitrary punishment and sexual abuse. Prisoners have been coerced to make confessions that they are members of Hamas.

[ 590 ] [ 591 ] [ 592 ] After conditions in the camp came to light in May 2024, the Supreme Court of Israel held a hearing and the IDF began transferring 1,200 of the prisoners to Ofer Prison .

[ 593 ] Detainees have reported severe instances of violence during transfers between prisons.

[ 588 ] [ 95 ] Several Palestinian healthcare workers have been abducted from Gaza hospitals during sieges by Israeli forces.

[ 95 ] On 5 December, Israeli forces abducted the adult men present at Al-Awda hospital and took them to Sde Teiman camp. Dr. Adnan Al-Bursh was detained and later died in Israeli custody.

[ 594 ] In March, Israeli forces abducted Khaled Alser, lead author of the first Lancet paper on trauma among Gazan ER patients and doctors, from Nasser Hospital. As of 31 August, he remains in detention and his whereabouts are unknown.

[ 595 ] Al-Araby TV correspondent Mohammed Arab was abducted from the Gaza strip in March 2024 and transferred to Ofer prison in July. After reports of his treatment were leaked to al-Araby, he was beaten, threatened and tortured. According to Arab's testimony, prison guards used dogs and fire extinguishers to enact sexual violence on other prisoners.

[ 587 ] In July 2024, military police raided Sde Teiman to arrest ten soldiers "suspected of the serious sexual abuse" of a Palestinian detainee. Israeli national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and other members of the far-right Otzma Yehudit party condemned the arrests.

[ 590 ] Supporters of the arrested soldiers including Ben Gvir, Amihai Eliyahu , Zvi Sukkot , and Nissim Vaturi stormed Sde Teiman that night in protest. Hours later, protestors broke into Beit Lid where the soldiers were being held.

[ 596 ] On 7 October 2024, American journalist Jeremy Loffredo and three other international and Israeli journalists were detained at a checkpoint in the West Bank on suspicion of "assisting an enemy in war" for their reporting on the October 2024 Iranian strikes against Israel . The journalists' cameras and phones were confiscated. Loffredo was released after four days in detention, and barred from leaving the country until 20 October.

[ 597 ] As of February 2025, at least 160 healthcare workers from Gaza were believed to be held in detention by Israel, with another 24 missing after being taken from hospitals in Gaza. Al-Shifa hospital director Mohammed Abu Selmia, who was detained for 7 months and released without charges, detailed many of the abuses he faced and said that "no day passes without torture" in Israeli prisons.

[ 598 ] American involvement Further information: Potential American ownership of the Gaza Strip US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Israeli President Isaac Herzog in Tel Aviv , Israel, 9 January 2024 The extent of American support for Israel has led the war to be labelled as 'the first US-Israeli joint war'.

[ 599 ] Alongside substantial military, financial, and diplomatic support , the US also intervened in the war directly. 100 American soldiers were deployed in combat to man a THAAD anti-air battery.

[ 600 ] [ 601 ] In addition, America piloted drones over Gaza in order to provide intelligence to Israel.

[ 602 ] This intelligence was aimed at locating Palestinian militant leaders in Gaza and the location of hostages; [ 603 ] this also included information on Sinwar's location.

[ 604 ] On 18 March 2025, after Israel's surprise attack on the Gaza Strip, Israeli government spokesman David Mencer stated that the operation had "fully coordinated with Washington" and thanked the Trump administration "for their unyielding support for Israel".

[ 605 ] On 6 April, a second THAAD system was deployed to Israel by the US.

[ 619 ] Scholars have estimated 80% of Palestinians killed are civilians.

[ 611 ] [ 610 ] [ 612 ] [ 620 ] A study by OHCHR , which verified fatalities from three independent sources, found that 70% of the Palestinians killed in residential buildings or similar housing were women and children.

[ 335 ] [ 621 ] The majority of casualties have been in the Gaza Strip . The GHM total casualty count is the number of deaths directly caused by the war. The demographic breakdown is a subset of those individually identified.

[ 622 ] [ 623 ] On 17 September 2024, the GHM published the names, gender and birth date of 34,344 individual Palestinians whose identities were confirmed and continues to attempt to identify all casualties.

[ 622 ] The GHM count does not include those who have died from "preventable disease, malnutrition and other consequences of the war".

[ 624 ] An analysis by the Gaza Health Projections Working Group predicted thousands of excess deaths from disease and birth complications.

[ 625 ] In January 2025, a peer-reviewed analysis of deaths in the Gaza war between October 2023 and 30 June 2024 was published in The Lancet . The paper estimated 64,260 deaths from traumatic injury during this period, and likely exceeding 70,000 by October 2024, with 59.1% of them being women, children and the elderly. It concluded that the GHM undercounted trauma-related deaths by 41% in its report, and also noted that its findings "underestimate the full impact of the military operation in Gaza, as they do not account for non-trauma-related deaths resulting from health service disruption, food insecurity, and inadequate water and sanitation." [ 14 ] A comparable figure for May 2025 would be 93,000 (77,000 to 109,000), representing 4–5% of Gaza's pre-war population.

[ 626 ] A survey by PCPSR reported showed over 60% of Gazans have lost family members since the war began.

[ 627 ] [ 628 ] Thousands of more dead bodies are thought to be under the rubble of destroyed buildings.

[ 629 ] [ 630 ] The number of injured is greater than 100,000; [ 631 ] Gaza has the most amputated children per capita in the world.

[ 632 ] The 7 October attacks on Israel killed 1,195 people, including 815 civilians.

[ 607 ] Casualties have also occurred in other parts of Israel, as well as in southern Lebanon , [ 633 ] Syria , [ 634 ] Yemen , [ 635 ] and Iran .

[ 636 ] According to the Israeli Ministry of Defense's Rehabilitation Division, about 1,000 soldiers are wounded every month.

[ 637 ] On 14 August 2024, the ministry predicted that it would have to account for 100,000 disabled IDF veterans by 2030 due to the war.

[ 638 ] Humanitarian crisis Main article: Gaza humanitarian crisis (2023–present) Further information: Gaza Strip famine and Timeline of the Gaza Strip healthcare collapse See also: Humanitarian aid during the Gaza war , Effect of the Gaza war on children in the Gaza Strip , and Gaza Strip evacuations Residents inspect the ruins of an apartment in Gaza destroyed by Israeli airstrikes The Gaza Strip is experiencing a humanitarian crisis as a result of the war, [ 639 ] [ 640 ] including a hunger crisis, in which famine-like conditions occurred in some areas of the strip and a high risk of famine persists as of October 2024, [ 641 ] [ 85 ] as well as a healthcare collapse . At the start of the war, Israel tightened its blockade on the strip , resulting in significant shortages of fuel, food, medication, water, and essential medical supplies.

[ 639 ] [ 642 ] [ 643 ] This siege resulted in a 90% drop in electricity availability, impacting hospital power supplies, sewage plants, and shutting down the desalination plants that provide drinking water.

[ 644 ] In July 2024, available water worked out to 4.74 litres per person per day, just under a third of the recommended minimum in emergencies.

[ 645 ] Doctors warned of disease outbreaks spreading due to overcrowded hospitals.

[ 640 ] A polio epidemic was the target of mostly-successful vaccination campaigns.

[ 646 ] Heavy bombardment by Israeli airstrikes caused catastrophic damage to Gaza's infrastructure, further deepening the crisis. Direct attacks on telecommunications infrastructure by Israel, electricity blockades, and fuel shortages caused the near-total collapse of Gaza's largest cell network providers.

[ 647 ] [ 648 ] [ 649 ] Lack of internet access has obstructed Gazan citizens from communicating with loved ones, learning of IDF operations, and identifying both the areas most exposed to bombing and possible escape routes.

[ 647 ] The blackouts impeded emergency services, making it harder to locate and access the time-critical injured, [ 647 ] and have impeded humanitarian aid agencies and journalists.

[ 647 ] By December 2023, 200,000 Gazans (approximately 10% of the population) had received internet access through an eSIM provided by Connecting Humanity .

[ 650 ] UN OCHA casualties summary, as of 19 June 2024 The Gaza Health Ministry reported over 4,000 children killed in the war's first month.

[ 651 ] UN Secretary-General António Guterres stated that Gaza had "become a graveyard for children." [ v ] [ 654 ] [ 655 ] Indirect Palestinian deaths are expected to be much higher due to the intensity of the conflict, destruction of healthcare infrastructure, lack of food, water, shelter, and safe places for civilians to flee to, and reduction in UNRWA funding, with a Lancet non peer-reviewed correspondence estimating that the death toll in Gaza, including future deaths indirectly caused by the war, may exceed 186,000.

[ 611 ] [ 656 ] In mid-April 2025, 12 CEOs of humanitarian organizations signed a statement that aid systems were in danger of collapsing.

[ 657 ] On 16 May, Donald Trump acknowledged starvation in Gaza and promoted a US-Israeli humanitarian aid plan where food would be distributed through a system of hubs run by private contractors and protected by Israeli soldiers. The US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation was set up to carry out this plan and announced it would be ready to begin operations by the end of May.

[ 658 ] [ 659 ] International aid agencies have rejected US-Israeli aid plans, saying that they weaponize humanitarian aid, violate principles of neutrality, will exacerbate mass displacement and would not be able to meet the scale of aid that is required.

[ 660 ] On 25 May, the UN's World Food Programme Executive Director Cindy McCain said only about 100 trucks a day were getting through, whereas prior to the blockade it had been upwards of 600 trucks a day.

[ 661 ] USAID had concluded that in the majority of cases of theft of food aid, the perpetuators could not be identified, although there was no evidence of the widespread diversion by Hamas.

[ 662 ] In July 2025, UN Humanitarian Chief Tom Fletcher said not enough "lorries" (trucks) of food aid were getting through. For example on July 27, 110 trucks entered Gaza, whereas during the two-month ceasefire earlier in 2025 the volume of aid trucks was more in the range of 600 to 700 trucks a day.

[ 663 ] Trump said Gaza is experiencing "real starvation", while Netanyahu blamed Hamas.

[ 663 ] [ 664 ] Projections show 100% of the population in Gaza is experiencing "high levels of acute food insecurity", with about 20% experiencing catastrophic levels as of July 2025.

[ 670 ] As of January 2024, researchers at Oregon State University and the City University of New York estimated that 50–62% of buildings in the Gaza Strip had been damaged or destroyed.

[ 672 ] [ 673 ] [ x ] [ y ] The damage to buildings in northern Gaza reportedly exceeds that in Bakhmut and Mariupol in the Russian invasion of Ukraine , [ 669 ] Aleppo in the Battle of Aleppo , [ 665 ] and Mosul and Raqqa in the War against the Islamic State .

[ 665 ] The 29,000 munitions Israel had dropped on Gaza in three months exceeded the amount (3,678) dropped by the US between 2004 and 2010 after its invasion of Iraq .

[ 676 ] According to satellite analyses, 68% of roads, 70% of greenhouses, and nearly 70% of tree crops have been damaged or destroyed.

[ 677 ] After a year, the UN estimates that a total of 42m tonnes of rubble clutter the Strip, to clear and rebuild which might take 80 years and cost over $80bn.

[ 678 ] The Guardian reported that the scale of destruction has led international legal experts to raise the concept of domicide , which it describes as "the mass destruction of dwellings to make [a] territory uninhabitable".

[ 666 ] The term urbicide has also been used to refer to the destruction of Gazan cities and their institutions.

[ 679 ] In October 2024, after monitoring and analyzing Israel's war conduct in Gaza for more than a year, Forensic Architecture published a cartographic map platform detailing Israel's campaign in Gaza titled "A Cartography of Genocide", accompanied by an 827-page text report that concludes that "Israel's military campaign in Gaza is organised, systematic, and intended to destroy conditions of life and life-sustaining infrastructure".

[ 680 ] War crimes Main article: War crimes in the Gaza war See also: Gaza genocide , Palestinian war crimes , and Israeli war crimes Palestinians mourn relatives killed when Israel bombed the Nuseirat refugee camp Memorial to the Israelis killed during the Nova music festival massacre in Re'im A UN Commission to the Israel–Palestine conflict stated that there is "clear evidence that war crimes may have been committed in the latest explosion of violence in Israel and Gaza, and all those who have violated international law and targeted civilians must be held accountable." [ 681 ] [ 682 ] [ 683 ] On 27 October, a spokesperson for the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) called for an independent court to review potential war crimes committed by both sides.

[ 684 ] The International Criminal Court (ICC) said that its mandate to investigate alleged war crimes committed since June 2014 in the State of Palestine extends to the current conflict.

[ 685 ] [ 686 ] On 20 May, ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan announced his intention to seek arrest warrants against Hamas leaders Yahya Sinwar, Mohammed Deif and Ismail Haniyeh, as well as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and then-Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant, for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity during the war.

[ 687 ] [ 688 ] [ 689 ] On 21 November, the ICC issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu, Gallant, and Deif for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity.

[ 690 ] [ 691 ] [ 692 ] The ICC canceled Deif's arrest warrant after confirming his death.

[ 693 ] On 7 June 2024, both Israel and Hamas were added to the list of shame , an annex attached to an annual report submitted by the UN Secretary-General documenting rights violations against children in armed conflict. While past reports accused Israel of grave rights violations against children, the country was never included in the annex.

[ 694 ] [ 695 ] [ 696 ] On 19 June 2024, the UN Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory presented a detailed report to the United Nations Human Rights Council covering the war from 7 October to 31 December 2023, affirming that both Hamas and Israel committed war crimes and that Israel's actions also constituted crimes against humanity.

[ 697 ] In a second report, the Commission found that Israel had carried out a policy of destroying Gaza's healthcare system.

[ 698 ] [ 699 ] The June report found that the military wing of Hamas and six other Palestinian armed groups were responsible for the war crimes of intentionally directing attacks against civilians, murder or willful killing, torture, inhuman or cruel treatment, destroying or seizing property, outrages upon personal dignity, and taking hostages, including children.

[ 700 ] [ 701 ] In relation to IDF operations and attacks in Gaza, the commission concluded that Israeli authorities are responsible for the war crimes of starvation as a method of warfare, murder or willful killing, intentionally directing attacks against civilians and civilian objects, forcible transfer, sexual violence, torture and inhuman or cruel treatment, arbitrary detention and outrages upon personal dignity. It also found that Israel committed numerous crimes against humanity, including carrying out the extermination of Palestinians and gender persecution targeting Palestinian men and boys.

[ 702 ] [ 703 ] [ 704 ] The commission said that they had submitted 7,000 pieces of evidence to the ICC related to crimes committed by Israel and Hamas, as part of the International Criminal Court investigation in Palestine .

[ 705 ] Photos of Palestinian healthcare workers killed in the Gaza war , 25 November 2023 In another report published in October 2024, the commission accused Israel of "committing war crimes and the crime against humanity of extermination with relentless and deliberate attacks on medical personnel and facilities" as well as accusing the IDF of deliberately killing and torturing medical personnel, targeting medical vehicles, and restricting patients from leaving Gaza. The report also addressed the detention of Palestinians in Israeli military camps and facilities, finding that thousands of child and adult detainees, many arbitrarily detained, faced widespread abuse, including physical and psychological violence, rape and other forms of sexual and gender-based violence, and conditions amounting to torture, highlighting that deaths resulting from such abuse or neglect constituted war crimes and violations of the right to life. Israel refused to cooperate with the investigation, contending that it had an "anti-Israel" bias.

[ 699 ] [ 706 ] On 5 December 2024, Amnesty International published a report concluding that Israel was committing genocide against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip; [ 87 ] [ 707 ] and on 19 December 2024, Human Rights Watch published a 179-page report concluding that Israel is responsible for the crime of genocide by intentionally depriving Palestinians in Gaza of access to safe water for drinking and sanitation needed for basic human survival.

[ 708 ] On 13 March 2025, the UN Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory released a report stating that Israel's attacks on women's healthcare facilities in Gaza amounted to genocidal acts, destroying "in part the reproductive capacity of Palestinians in Gaza as a group".

[ 709 ] Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the report as "false and absurd", and accused UN Human Rights Council of being anti-Israel and anti-Semitic.

[ 710 ] On 13 July 2025, Brazilian minister of foreign relations Mauro Vieira announced that Brazil would officially join South Africa's ICJ case accusing Israel of committing genocide in Gaza .

[ 711 ] On 28 July 2025, Israeli human rights groups B'Tselem [ 712 ] and Physicians for Human Rights–Israel [ 713 ] released reports calling Israel's campaign in Gaza a genocide. The B'Tselem report also claimed that European and US leaders were enabling the genocide.

[ 712 ] [ 714 ] Various genocide studies and international law scholars have also said that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza.

[ 102 ] Diplomatic impact Main article: Diplomatic impact of the Gaza war Further information: 2023 Gaza war ceasefire , 2023 Israeli–Palestinian prisoner exchange , and 2024 Beijing Declaration See also: Israeli–Palestinian peace process and Two-state solution US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and foreign ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council member states in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, 19 April 2024 The war sparked a diplomatic crisis , with countries around the world reacting strongly to the conflict, that affected the momentum of regional relations.

[ 715 ] At least nine countries withdrew their ambassadors or cut diplomatic ties with Israel.

[ 716 ] [ 717 ] The war has also resulted in a renewed focus on a two-state solution to the broader conflict.

[ 718 ] [ 719 ] Global public opinion of Israel dropped during the war; a Morning Consult poll published in January 2024 indicated that the United States was the only remaining wealthy country in which Israel had net positive approval.

[ 720 ] Negotiations have focused on the possibility of a ceasefire , with the US, Egypt and Qatar serving as negotiation mediators between Israel and Hamas.

[ 721 ] [ 722 ] The United Nations Security Council passed resolution 2728 in March 2024, calling for an immediate ceasefire and the unconditional release of hostages for the month of Ramadan .

[ 293 ] [ 723 ] The United Nations Security Council passed resolution 2735 in June 2024, calling for acceptance of the three-phase ceasefire proposal.

[ 724 ] Following talks mediated by China , on 23 July 2024, Palestinian groups including Hamas and Fatah reached an agreement to end their divisions and form a unity government for Gaza, which they announced in the Beijing Declaration .

[ 725 ] At the UNGA, Saudi Arabia announced a global alliance to push for a two-state solution. Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said almost 90 countries were at the launch of The Global Alliance for the Implementation of a Palestinian State and a Two-State Solution.

[ 726 ] [ 727 ] [ 728 ] On 29 September, Saudi Arabia said they would send aid to the Palestinian Authority, $60 million in six installments according to a senior PA official. The aid is seen as means of keeping the PA solvent and maintaining the push for a two-state solution, notwithstanding Israeli financial restrictions.

[ 729 ] On 9 August 2025, the Qatari Prime Minister met with U.S. Envoy Steve Witkoff regarding a potential deal for the return of all hostages, living and dead, in return for an end to the war. The meeting is towards making “workable” a joint Egyptian-Qatari proposal.

[ 730 ] The Director of Israel’s spy agency Mossad traveled to Qatar on 14 August for negotiations. In addition to Qatar and Egypt, Turkey is also involved in negotiations to end the war.

[ 731 ] Reactions Main article: International reactions to the Gaza war See also: Arms embargoes on Israel Israel Main article: Israeli government response to the October 7 attacks The Israeli government's response to the 7 October Hamas-led attack on Israel has multiple aspects, including a military response leading to the Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip . In October, the Knesset approved a war cabinet in Israel , adding National Unity ministers and altering the government; Benjamin Netanyahu and Benny Gantz froze non-war legislation, establishing a war cabinet with military authority.

Settler expansions and officials' remarks heightened unrest, leading to protests within Israel . The Knesset's law criminalizing "terrorist materials" consumption drew criticism.

[ 732 ] In an interview to the Wall Street Journal on 25 December, Netanyahu said that Israel's objectives were to "destroy Hamas, demilitarize Gaza and deradicalize the whole of Palestinian society".

[ 733 ] There was broad support in Israeli society for military operations in Gaza.

[ 734 ] [ 735 ] A public opinion poll conducted in December 2023 by the Israel Democracy Institute found that 87% of Jewish Israelis supported the war in Gaza.

[ 736 ] In another Israel Democracy Institute survey of 510 Israeli citizens in early February 2024, 68% of respondents supported preventing all international aid from entering Gaza.

[ 737 ] A poll commissioned by Penn State University and conducted in March 2025 among a representative sample of 1,005 Israeli Jews found that 82% supported the forced expulsion of Gaza residents. Additionally, 47% responded affirmatively to the question: "When conquering an enemy city, should the IDF act like the Israelites led by Joshua when they conquered Jericho , that is, kill all its inhabitants?" [ 738 ] [ 739 ] Occupied Palestinian territories Initially, Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas asserted the Palestinian people's right to self-defense against the "terror of settlers and occupation troops" [ 740 ] and condemned the orders by Israel for residents to evacuate north Gaza, labeling it a "second Nakba".

[ 741 ] Later, Abbas rejected the killing of civilians on both sides, and said that the Palestinian Liberation Organization was the sole representative of the Palestinian people.

[ 742 ] A December 2023 poll by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research found that 72% of respondents (52% of Gazans and 85% of West Bank residents) approved of the October 7 attacks.

[ 743 ] A 2024 follow-up poll found that two-thirds of respondents continued to approve of the attacks.

[ 744 ] About 90% of respondents did not believe that Hamas committed atrocities (killing women and children, sexual violence) during the October 7 attacks, seeing this as enemy propaganda.

[ 744 ] Half of respondents in Gaza expected Hamas to win the war, while a quarter expected Israel to win.

[ 744 ] International Main article: International reactions to the Gaza war Further information: Arms embargoes on Israel since 2023 , United States support for Israel in the Gaza war , United Kingdom and the Gaza war , European Union reactions to the Gaza war , Gaza war protests , Violent incidents in reaction to the Gaza war , and Calls for a ceasefire during the Gaza war US Vice President Kamala Harris with Israeli President Isaac Herzog at the 60th Munich Security Conference in Germany, February 2024 Significant geopolitical divisions emerged during the war. Israel's traditional Western allies provided diplomatic backing and weaponry to Israel; [ 745 ] including the United States, [ 746 ] United Kingdom, [ 747 ] and Germany.

[ 748 ] However several European nations have been less supportive of Israel's actions, most notably Spain , Norway , and Ireland who formally recognized the State of Palestine in a coordinated move in June 2024.

[ 749 ] Spain and Ireland have also supported South Africa's genocide case against Israel .

[ 750 ] [ 751 ] This has led to retaliatory action by Israel, who recalled its ambassadors to all three countries and later announced that it would be closing its embassy in Dublin.

[ 752 ] [ 753 ] [ 754 ] Hugh Lovatt of the European Council on Foreign Relations says that during the Cold War, Israel sided with the West against the Arab countries supported by the Soviets, and Western leaders generally see Israel "as a fellow member of the liberal democratic club" and that this partially "explains the continued strong Western support for Israel – which has now largely become reflexive".

[ 745 ] At least 44 nations denounced Hamas and explicitly condemned its conduct on 7 October as terrorism, including a joint statement by the US, UK, France, Italy, and Germany.

[ 755 ] In contrast, the Islamic world and much of the Global South denounced the actions of Israel and its allies, criticizing the "moral authority of the West" and alleging that it holds double standards surrounding human rights .

[ 745 ] [ 756 ] The double standards, in their view, is condemning Russia's invasion and occupation of Ukrainian land while standing firmly behind Israel's occupation of Palestinian territory.

[ 757 ] Bolivia has cut all ties with Israel as a result of the conflict, while Colombia and Chile recalled their ambassadors to the country.

[ 237 ] [ 756 ] The United States and Germany have supplied Israel with substantial military and medical aid.

[ 747 ] [ 758 ] [ 759 ] The United Kingdom issues licenses for British companies to sell weapons to Israel, supplying less than 1% of Israel's military imports.

[ 760 ] In September 2024, the UK suspended some military exports to Israel because there was a "clear risk" they might be used to violate international law.

[ 761 ] The Israeli government's response prompted international protests , arrests, and harassment .

[ 762 ] Evacuations of foreign nationals Main article: Evacuations during the Gaza war Brazil announced a rescue operation of nationals using an air force transport aircraft.

[ 763 ] Poland announced that it would deploy two C-130 transport planes to evacuate 200 Polish nationals.

[ 764 ] Hungary evacuated 215 of its nationals from Israel using two aircraft on 9 October, while Romania evacuated 245 of its citizens, including two pilgrimage groups, on two TAROM planes and two private aircraft on the same day.

[ 765 ] Australia also announced repatriation flights.

[ 766 ] 300 Nigerian pilgrims in Israel fled to Jordan before being airlifted home.

[ 767 ] On 12 October, the United Kingdom arranged flights for its citizens in Israel; the first plane departed Ben Gurion Airport that day. The government had said before that it would not be evacuating its nationals due to available commercial flights. However, most commercial flights were suspended.

[ 768 ] Nepal arranged a flight to evacuate at least 254 of its citizens who were studying in Israel.

[ 769 ] India launched Operation Ajay to evacuate its citizens from Israel.

[ 770 ] Ukraine facilitated the evacuation of ~450 of its citizens from Israel as of 18 October, with additional evacuation flights planned for the near future.

[ 771 ] Impacts Main article: Impacts of the Gaza war Regional impact According to Daniel Byman and Alexander Palmer, the attack showcased the decline of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and the rise of Hamas as a power center in Palestinian politics . They predicted the PLO's further decline if the status quo held.

[ 772 ] Laith Alajlouni wrote that the immediate effect of the Hamas offensive was to unite Hamas and PLO.

[ 773 ] Amit Segal , chief political commentator for Israel's Channel 12 , said that the conflict would test Benjamin Netanyahu's survival as prime minister , noting that past wars had toppled the governments of several of his predecessors such as that of Golda Meir following the 1973 Yom Kippur War, Menachem Begin following the 1982 Lebanon War , and Ehud Olmert following the 2006 Lebanon War .

[ 774 ] Citing the Israeli intelligence failure, which some observers attributed to the incumbent government focusing more on internal dissent, the judicial reform , and efforts to deepen Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories, [ 775 ] some commentators criticized Netanyahu for putting aside the PLO and propping up Hamas, [ 157 ] and described him as a liability.

[ 776 ] [ 777 ] In an analysis by The Times of Israel , the newspaper wrote, "Hamas has violently shifted the world's eyes back to the Palestinians and dealt a severe blow to the momentum for securing a landmark US-brokered deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia." [ 778 ] Andreas Kluth wrote in his Bloomberg News column that Hamas "torched Biden's deal to remake the Middle East", arguing that the deal that was being discussed between Saudi Arabia, Israel, and the US would have left Palestinians in the cold, so the group decided to "blow the whole thing up". He added that viewed from Gaza, things were only going to get worse, considering that Netanyahu's coalition partners opposed a two-state solution. He suggested they would prefer to annex the entirety of the West Bank, even at the expense of turning Israel into an apartheid state.

[ 779 ] Economic impact Main article: Economic impact of the Gaza war The Bank of Israel estimates that by 2025, the war will have cost the country US$ 67 billion, notwithstanding a $14.5 billion US aid package, part of the $22.76 billion the US has so far allocated for military assistance.

[ 780 ] [ z ] As early as 9 November 2023, the Bank of Israel reported that the drop in labor supply caused by the war was costing the Israeli economy $600 million a week, or 6% of weekly GDP. The bank also stated that the estimate did not include damage caused by the absence of Palestinian and foreign workers.

[ 782 ] In the final quarter of 2023, the Israeli economy shrank by 5.2% quarter-to-quarter due to labor shortages in construction and from the mobilization of 300,000 reservists.

[ 783 ] While Israel did still see economic growth of 2%, this was down from 6.5% growth in the year before the war. Consumer spending declined by 27%, imports declined by 42% and exports declined by 18%.

Israel's high-tech factories reported in December that recent bureaucratic obstacles with electronic imports from China had led to higher import costs and delayed delivery times.

[ 784 ] Israeli officials also reported that China had refused to send workers to their country during the war against the backdrop of a worker shortage in Israel's construction and farming sectors.

[ 785 ] China's actions were described as a de facto sanction .

[ 786 ] [ 784 ] The 3,500-member Water Transport Workers Federation of India said it would refuse to operate shipments carrying weapons to Israel.

[ 787 ] The declaration came a few months after one Indian company halted production of Israeli police uniforms due to the war in Gaza.

[ 788 ] About 9,855 Thai workers in the agricultural sector, 4,331 workers in the construction sector and 2,997 in the nursing sector left Israel following the 7 October attack. In addition, the prevention of 85,000 Palestinian workers from entering Israel created a shortage of about 100,000 foreign and Palestinian workers.

[ 789 ] It has been calculated that the carbon cost in terms of climate impact of rebuilding Gaza would exceed the annual greenhouse emissions of 135 countries.

[ 790 ] Media coverage Main article: Media coverage of the Gaza war See also: Media coverage of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict In reporting on the conflict, foreign media have limited access to Gaza and only in the presence of Israeli soldiers.

Vox reported that the news organizations "have to submit all materials and footage to the IDF for review before publication".

[ 791 ] The conflict has also seen large numbers of journalists wounded or killed in action. On 14 December, CBS reported on a statement from the International Federation of Journalists that "the number of journalists killed in the past two months in the war in Gaza has surpassed the amount killed in the Vietnam War , which lasted two decades".

[ 792 ] Reporters Without Borders filed a complaint with the International Criminal Court under section 8.2.b of the Rome Statute , accusing Israel of committing war crimes against eight journalists.

[ 793 ] [ 791 ] It also lodged a complaint against Hamas under section 8.2.a of the Rome Statute for the killing of a reporter covering the 7 October attack.

[ 793 ] The Committee to Protect Journalists accused Israel of targeting journalists reporting from Gaza and their families, saying that in at least two cases, "journalists reported receiving threats from Israeli officials and Israel Defense Forces officers before their family members were killed".

The "Lavender" system is designed to identify individuals suspected of being part of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), even targeting those with lower ranks for potential aerial bombardments. In the initial stages of the conflict, the military heavily relied on Lavender, leading to the system labeling up to 37,000 Palestinians as militants, along with their residences, for potential airstrikes.

Netanyahu said last week that Israel has killed 14,000 Hamas militants; the IDF put its estimate at 13,000 last month. The numbers are not possible to independently verify — and no evidence has been offered to support them — but even the high-end figure would amount to less than half of Hamas's estimated fighting force before the war. Thousands of other militants belong to smaller groups that vie with Hamas for local influence.

In recent conflicts, such indirect deaths range from three to 15 times the number of direct deaths. Applying a conservative estimate of four indirect deaths per one direct death to the 37,396 deaths reported, it is not implausible to estimate that up to 186,000 or even more deaths could be attributable to the current conflict in Gaza. Using the 2022 Gaza Strip population estimate of 2,375,259, this would translate to 7.9% of the total population in the Gaza Strip.

The researchers found that the overlap was so small that the true number of deaths was probably 46-107% higher than the official ministry total. If you assume that the ratio has stayed the same since last June (and not fallen, as systems caught up during the ceasefire, say) and apply them to the current tally, it would suggest that between 77,000 and 109,000 Gazans have been killed, 4-5% of the territory's pre-war population (see chart).

It assesses allegations of violations and crimes under international law by Israel in Gaza within the framework of genocide under international law, concluding that there is sufficient evidence to believe that Israel's conduct in Gaza following 7 October 2023 amounts to genocide.

The review presented in this report leaves no room for doubt: since October 2023, the Israeli regime has been responsible for carrying out genocide against the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. Killing tens of thousands of people; causing bodily or mental harm to hundreds of thousands more; destroying homes and civilian infrastructure on a massive scale; starvation, displacement, and denying humanitarian aid — all this is being perpetrated systematically, as part of a coordinated attack aimed at annihilating all facets of life in the Gaza Strip.

In most of the Gaza Strip, even at this moment, there are no IDF fighters, and the IDF, legally and apparently factually, is not defined as an occupier because Hamas still controls the territory to one degree or another and provides civilian services to the local population. This does not prevent government ministers from boasting of terms that are pleasing to the right ear, "the IDF is occupying," despite the distance between this statement and reality.

The Economist . 8 May 2025.

The researchers found that the overlap was so small that the true number of deaths was probably 46-107% higher than the official ministry total. If you assume that the ratio has stayed the same since last June (and not fallen, as systems caught up during the ceasefire, say) and apply them to the current tally, it would suggest that between 77,000 and 109,000 Gazans have been killed, 4-5% of the territory's pre-war population (see chart).

The Guardian . Retrieved 6 June 2024 .

The carbon cost of rebuilding Gaza will be greater than the annual greenhouse gas emissions generated individually by 135 countries, exacerbating the global climate emergency on top of the unprecedented death toll, new research reveals. Reconstructing the estimated 200,000 apartment buildings, schools, universities, hospitals, mosques, bakeries, water and sewage plants damaged and destroyed by Israel in the first four months of the war on Gaza will generate as much as 60m tonnes of CO2 equivalent (tCO2e), according to new analysis by researchers in the UK and US. This is on a par with the total 2022 emissions generated by countries such as Portugal and Sweden – and more than twice the annual emissions of Afghanistan.
