Most historical scholars refer to the works of Euler by their Eneström index.

[ 1 ] Eneström received a Bachelor of Science ( filosofie kandidat ) degree from Uppsala university in 1871, received a position at Uppsala University Library in 1875, and at the National Library of Sweden in 1879.

From 1884 to 1914, he was the publisher of the mathematical-historical journal Bibliotheca Mathematica , which he had founded and partially funded with his own means. Concerning the history of mathematics, he was known as critical to Moritz Cantor .

With Soichi Kakeya , he is known for the Eneström-Kakeya theorem [ 2 ] which determines an annulus containing the roots of a real polynomial . Specifically, it states that for an n {\displaystyle n} -degree polynomial P ( z ) = ∑ ∑ k = 0 n a k z k {\displaystyle P(z)=\sum _{k=0}^{n}a_{k}z^{k}} with a complex variable z {\displaystyle z} and real coefficients satisfying 0 ≤ ≤ a 0 ≤ ≤ a 1 ≤ ≤ ⋯ ⋯ ≤ ≤ a n {\displaystyle 0\leq a_{0}\leq a_{1}\leq \cdots \leq a_{n}} , all zeros of P ( z ) {\displaystyle P(z)} lie within the disk | z | ≤ ≤ 1 {\displaystyle |z|\leq 1} .

In 1923 George Sarton wrote, "No one has done more for the sound development of our studies". Sarton went on: "the very presence of Eneström obliged every scholar devoting himself to the history of mathematics to increase his circumspection and improve his work." [ 3 ] Eneström has also developed an election method similar to Phragmen's voting rules .
