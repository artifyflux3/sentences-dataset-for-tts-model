American Nitrox Divers International Abbreviation ANDI Formation 1988 Type NGO Headquarters Freeport, New York Location 74 Woodcleft Avenue Freeport New York 11520-3342 Region served World wide President Ed Betts Website www .andihq .com American Nitrox Divers International (or ANDI ) was founded by Ed Betts and Dick Rutkowski in 1988.

[ 1 ] ANDI has since expanded to include offices in The United Kingdom, Israel, Australia, Sweden, Italy, Germany, The Netherlands, Greece, Japan, Taiwan, Republic of Korea, Republic of Maldives, Republic of Philippines, Latin America, Middle East, with its home office in the United States of America.

[ 2 ] " SafeAir " is ANDI's term of art for breathing mixtures with extra oxygen added that are commonly known as nitrox or Enriched Air Nitrox (EAN).

[ 3 ] Origins and history [ edit ] ANDI was founded by Ed Betts and Dick Rutkowski in 1988 for the following purpose - "to standardize Instructor Training, Sport Diver Training, and refill station dispensing procedures for Enriched Air Nitrox diving." [ 1 ] [ 4 ] It is one of the first diver training organisations to specialize in technical diving and in the delivery of training for the use of nitrox.

[ 5 ] Between the years 1989 and 2000, ANDI is reported by the Divers Alert Network as certifying 49,118 divers out of a global total of 233,798 in the use of nitrox along with the certification of 3,196 instructors (out of a global total of 32,924) to specifically teach nitrox.

[ 6 ] Certification [ edit ] ANDI offers training programs for recreational diving, use of nitrox, technical diving (including rebreather), gas blending, equipment service, diver first aid and hyperbaric chamber personnel.

[ 7 ] Each program is identified by “a three-letter course code”. Programs specific to diver training are also classified by a “Level of Training” in order to “differentiate the programs and their scope of training” with Level 1 (L1) being “an introductory program for new divers or divers-in-training” while Level 5 (L5) is used for the highest level of training, i.e. “exploration courses" that "involve the use of other inert gases".
