{\displaystyle u_{x,y}+{\frac {N(u_{x}+u_{y})}{x+y}}=0.} This equation is named for Siméon Poisson , Leonhard Euler , and Gaston Darboux . It plays an important role in solving the classical wave equation .

This equation is related to u r r + m r u r − − u t t = 0 , {\displaystyle u_{rr}+{\frac {m}{r}}u_{r}-u_{tt}=0,} by x = r + t {\displaystyle x=r+t} , y = r − − t {\displaystyle y=r-t} , where N = m 2 {\displaystyle N={\frac {m}{2}}} [ 2 ] and some sources quote this equation when referring to the Euler–Poisson–Darboux equation.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] The EPD equation  equation is the simplest linear hyperbolic equation in two independent variables whose coefficients exhibit singularities, therefore it has an interest  as a paradigm to relativity theory.

[ 7 ] Compact support self-similar solution of the EPD equation for thermal conduction was derived starting from the modified Fourier-Cattaneo law.

[ 8 ] It is also possible to solve the non-linear EPD equations with the method of generalized separation of variables .
