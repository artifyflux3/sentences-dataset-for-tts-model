It was founded in Durham, North Carolina , in 1980 at Duke University to provide 24/7 telephone diving medical assistance. Since then the organisation has expanded globally and now has independent regional organisations in North America , Europe , Japan , Asia-Pacific and Southern Africa .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] DAN publishes research results on a wide range of matters relating to diving safety and medicine and diving accident analysis, including annual reports on decompression illness and diving fatalities. Most are freely available on the internet, many of these were at the  now defunct Rubicon Research Repository .

[ needs update ] This list includes publications where one or more authors are staff or members of one of the DAN affiliates, where a large part of the data is from one of the DAN Databases, or where the research was funded by DAN.

Alert Diver [ edit ] DAN publishes a periodical for members in print and online. Alert Diver is currently published quarterly. Back issues are often available on the DAN website.
