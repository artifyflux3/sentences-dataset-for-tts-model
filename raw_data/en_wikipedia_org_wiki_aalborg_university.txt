Founded in 1974, the university awards bachelor's degrees , master's degrees , and PhD degrees in a wide variety of subjects within humanities , social sciences , information technology , design , engineering , exact sciences , and medicine . The motto of the university in Danish is ad nye veje (on new paths).

History [ edit ] The movement for a university in the North Jutland Region started in 1961 when the North Jutland Committee for higher education institutions was established. On 19 August 1969 the Aalborg University Association was founded and a planning group was established with Eigil Hastrup as chairman. The same year in December, about 1,000 people from North Jutland demonstrated in front of the Folketinget (the Danish Parliament) for their cause.

[ 5 ] In 1970, the law for the establishment of a university centre in Aalborg was passed in the Danish Parliament. In 1972, it was decided that the first rector of the new university center should be the Swedish historian and professor Jörgen Weibull. On 1 September 1974, Aalborg University Center (AUC) was inaugurated by Queen Margrethe II of Denmark . Jørgen Weibull was replaced by Sven Caspersen as rector of Aalborg University Center (AUC) in 1976. At the same time, a new management organization was established under a consistory. The first formal cooperation agreement was signed with the University of Wisconsin–Green Bay in 1980. The North Jutland knowledge park was established in 1989 as a neighbor to Aalborg University Center (AUC).

[ citation needed ] In 1993, external representatives joined the consistory. In 1994, Aalborg University Center (AUC) changed its name to Aalborg University (AAU).

Aalborg University - Esbjerg was established through a merger between the engineering college in Esbjerg and Aalborg University in 1995. In 1998, the NOVI science park was connected to Aalborg University.

Aalborg University Copenhagen was formed in collaboration with the engineering college in Copenhagen in 2003. A new university board was formed and joined by its members on 1 February 2004, with Jørgen Østergaard appointed as rector. In 2005, Finn Kjærsdam was hired by the university board as rector. Aalborg University and the Danish Building Research Institute merged in 2007. In 2010, Aalborg University established a faculty of Medicine and created a medical education.

Per Michael Johansen was hired as rector by the university board in 2014.

[ 5 ] List of rectors [ edit ] Since Aalborg University's foundation in 1974, the university has had a total of five rectors in office.

[ citation needed ] Period Name Research area 1974–1976 Jörgen Weibull History 1976–2004 Sven Caspersen Economics 2004–2005 Jørgen Østergaard Engineering 2005–2014 Finn Kjærsdam Land Surveying and Urban Planning 2014–present Per Michael Johansen Engineering and Physics Profile [ edit ] Aalborg University differentiates itself from the older and more traditional Danish universities with its focus on interdisciplinary, inter-faculty studies; an experimental curriculum based on an interdisciplinary basic course with subsequent specialisation; a pedagogical structure based on problem-centred, real-life projects of educational and research relevance – which internationally has become known and recognised as The Aalborg Model . With the problem-based, project-organised model, semesters at AAU are centred around complex real-life problems which students attempt to find answers to in a scientific manner while working together in groups. In February 2007, the foundation of the UICEE Centre for Problem Based Learning (UCPBL) paid recognition to Aalborg University, which subsequently led to the appointment of AAU as UNESCO Chair in problem-based learning .

[ 11 ] In a Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) study which analyzed the global state of art in the engineering education, Aalborg University (AAU) was named as the leading university in Europe in engineering education by 50 thought leaders from all over the world.

[ 12 ] In 2021, Times Higher Education Impact Rankings ranked Aalborg University number 6 in the world, out of 1,117 universities from 94 countries/regions, according to the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals .

[ 13 ] That is the number 1 university in the European Union (EU). In 2022, Times Higher Education Impact Rankings ranked Aalborg University (AAU) as the best university in the world in Sustainable Development Goal 4 (Quality Education) for the third year in a row.

[ 14 ] For the academic year 2023, in overall terms, Aalborg University (AAU) has significantly dropped in worldwide university rankings, according to THE and QS.

The rector is appointed by the university board. The rector in turn appoints deans, and deans appoint heads of departments. There is no faculty senate and faculty are not involved in the appointment of rector, deans, or department heads. Hence the university has no faculty governance.

[ 16 ] Campuses [ edit ] Aalborg University (AAU) has campuses in Aalborg, Esbjerg, and Copenhagen.

[ citation needed ] Esbjerg [ edit ] Aalborg University Esbjerg (AAU-Esbjerg) is an organisational unit (department) under Aalborg University, but is geographically located in Esbjerg .

[ citation needed ] AAUE has approximately 500 students and educates mainly engineers , but also offers a number of niche programmes such as fishing technology and a graduate degree in computer science education (Bachelor of Science in software engineering).

[ citation needed ] Aalborg University Esbjerg was created through a merger of Engineering College Esbjerg and Aalborg University in 1995. Since the merger, the number of applicants for Aalborg University Esbjerg has risen steadily and therefore there have been a need for extensions of the physical environment in several stages.

[ citation needed ] The university offers programmes in information technology, with a Department of Software and Media Technology .
