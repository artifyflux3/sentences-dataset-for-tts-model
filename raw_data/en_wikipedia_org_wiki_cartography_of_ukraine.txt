Early maps [ edit ] The oldest-known 'map' of part of Ukraine is the Dura-Europos route map , found in 1923 on the shield of a Roman soldier (dated to the 230s) in Dura-Europos on the banks of the Euphrates in present-day Syria .

[ 1 ] It features part of the Black Sea coast, including the Greek names of cities on the territory of modern Ukraine, such as Τύρα μί(λια) πδ´ or Tyras , near modern Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi , and the Borysthenes river ( Dnipro ).

[ 1 ] Hand-drawn maps of Ukraine have been produced since the Middle Ages .

[ 1 ] Polish historian Bernard Wapowski was the first to create modern "maps of Poland and Lithuania (or Southern Sarmatia), includ[ing] Ukraine as far east as the Dnieper River and the Black Sea", in 1526 and 1528.

[ 1 ] Battista Agnese 's 1548 map was the first to include Ukrainian territory east of the Dnipro, and south of the Black Sea and Sea of Azov .

[ 1 ] Especially the Black Sea region was well-mapped due to its strategic and economic importance as the Ottoman Empire rose as a regional power.

[ 1 ] During the Turkish wars between 1568 and 1918, high-quality French maps were kept [ by whom?

] as state secrets amid diplomatic negotiations, while 20th-century maps have reflected the region's multiple changes of government.

Ukraine is largely absent from the maps of the Turkish manuscript mapping-tradition that flourished during the reign of the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II the Conqueror ( r.

1444–1446, 1451–1481 ); the Mediterranean received its own section in world maps, [ 2 ] : 5 but typical Turkish maps of the period omitted the Black Sea , and the entire region of the Rus' appeared as just a small portion of Asia between the Caspian and the Mediterranean.

[ 2 ] : 7 17th century [ edit ] Further information: General Map of Ukraine See also: Description of Ukraine Two centuries later Guillaume le Vasseur, sieur de Beauplan became one of the more prominent cartographers working with Ukrainian data.  His 1639 descriptive map of the region was the first such one produced, and after he published a pair of Ukraine maps of different scale in 1660, his drawings were republished [ by whom?

] throughout much of Europe.

[ 3 ] A copy of de Beauplan's maps played a crucial role in negotiations between the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Ottoman Empire in 1640; its depiction of the disputed Kodak Fortress was of such quality that the head Polish ambassador, Wojciech Miaskowski , deemed it dangerous to exhibit it to his Turkish counterparts.

[ 4 ] Giacomo Cantelli da Vignola 's 1684 map of Tartaria d'Europa [ 5 ] includes "Vkraina o Paese dei Cossachi de Zaporowa" [Ukraine or the land of the Zaporozhian Cossacks ].

18th century [ edit ] English-language maps of 1769 depicted the Crimean Khanate as part of its suzerain , the Ottoman Empire, with clear boundaries between the Muslim -ruled states in the south and the Christian -ruled states to the north.  Another map from the eighteenth century, inscribed in Latin, was careful to depict a small buffer zone between Kiev and the Polish border.

( August 2014 ) In more recent history, maps of the country have reflected its tumultuous political status and relations with Russia ; for example, the city known as "Lvov" ( Russian : Львов ) during the Soviet era (until 1991) was depicted as "Leopol" or "Lemberg" during its time (1772-1918) in the Habsburg realms , while post-Soviet maps produced in Ukraine have referred to it by its endonym of "Lviv" [ 6 ] ( Ukrainian : Львів ). (Under Polish rule (1272-1772) it went by the Polish name of Lwów ).

1154 Map of al-Idrisi Abu Abdullah Muhammad al-Idrisi al-Qurtubi al-Hasani al-Sabti The map of al-Idrisi in 1154 shows not only the territorial placement of Ukraine , but also for the first time the name "Rusia" (meaning Kievan Rus' ). The inscriptions on the map include "Ard al Rusia" - the land of Rus' (the territory of Right-bank and Left-bank Ukraine ), "muttasil ard al Rusia" - the connected land of Rus', "minal Rusia al tuani" - dependent on Rus'. The rivers - Dnipro , Dniester , Danube - are marked and labeled, as well as Kyiv (Kiau) and other Ukrainian cities .

1375 Atles Català Catalan Atlas ( Portolan ) Abraham Cresques The cartography was done during the decline of the Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia during the Galicia–Volhynia Wars , as well as the Great Troubles of the Golden Horde . The map shows the cities of Lviv ( Ciutà de Leó ) [ 7 ] and Kyiv ( Chiva ), as well as the country of Rus' ( Rossia ) on the right bank of the Dnipro . Lviv is marked as a European city with a flag whose coat of arms appears in the Castilian armorial Book of Knowledge of All Kingdoms . Kyiv is depicted as an independent Asian city; it is located in the lower reaches of the Dnipro .

It makes some general observations about the size of Ukraine's territory and population, comparing it to other European countries, while its economy is compared to the rest of the former Russian Empire, claiming that "Ukraine was the economic backbone of Russian power", dwarfing "the rest of Russia" in peacetime production of grain , sugar, iron, coal, anthracite , and coke .

See also [ edit ] Ukrainian Wikisource has original text related to this article: Україна на карті Європи Geography of Ukraine Maria Vavrychyn Notes [ edit ] ^ The overall Tendenz of the caption is negative towards Ukrainian independence; at the time, the United States and other Allies of World War I were trying to assist the Whites to restore the Russian Empire (which had been "dismembered" into "fragments", suggesting it should be put back together), and engaged in direct combat with the Central Powers , which had just (depending on one's point of view) invaded/liberated Ukraine .

On the other hand, the Allies did favour an independent Polish state , primarily as an ally against Germany and Austria-Hungary. Reflecting a pro-Polish perspective, the caption states that the transfer of Kholm to Ukraine was done "on the basis of the extreme claims of the Ukrainians", while pointing out "Ukraine gets no Austro-Hungarian territory"; UPR diplomats had indeed sought the inclusion of Eastern Galicia .

Perhaps somewhat ironically, right next to this map, The New York Times reprinted "Ukraine's Struggle for Self-Government" , an article written just before the war by Mykhailo Hrushevsky (president of the Ukrainian People's Republic , 28 March–29 April 1918), with a very positive attitude towards Ukrainian independence.

^ Ukraine has long been known as "the Breadbasket of Europe "; the map states In der Ukraine liegt das berühmte Schwarzerdegebiet. Dieses erzeugte fast das ganze Ausfuhrgetreide Rußlands.

("Ukraine is home to the famous black earth region. This produced almost all of Russia's export grain.") It was especially the unfolding food crisis and famine in Austria in late 1917 and early 1918 which pushed diplomats of Austria-Hungary to conclude a separate peace with the Ukrainian People's Republic, recognising its independence on the basis of national self-determination , knowing this would embolden ethnic separatism within their own multi-ethnic empire; because without access to Ukrainian foodstuffs to feed its starving military and civilians, a domestic revolution was expected to topple the Habsburg monarchy within weeks. (This is why the Treaty of 9 February 1918 was labelled a "Bread Peace". In the end, the foodstuffs from Ukraine only bought Austria-Hungary several more months of time, before the emboldened separatists indeed pushed for independence, and caused the Dissolution of Austria-Hungary in late 1918).

[ 15 ] The map goes on to summarise how Ukraine's mineral industry might benefit the Central Powers: "The economic production of Ukraine in peacetime could secure the need of the Central Powers, its rich deposits of coal, iron ore, salt and petroleum would leave a surplus for Central Europe."
