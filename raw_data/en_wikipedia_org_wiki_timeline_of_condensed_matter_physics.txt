This branch of physics focuses on understanding and studying the physical properties and transitions between phases of matter . Condensed matter refers to materials where particles ( atoms , molecules , or ions ) are closely packed together or under interaction, such as solids and liquids . This field explores a wide range of phenomena, including the electronic , magnetic , thermal , and mechanical properties of matter .

This timeline includes developments in subfields of condensed matter physics such as theoretical crystallography , solid-state physics , soft matter physics, mesoscopic physics , material physics , low-temperature physics , microscopic theories of magnetism in matter and optical properties of matter and metamaterials .

Even if material properties were modeled before 1900, condensed matter topics were considered as part of physics since the development of quantum mechanics and microscopic theories of matter. According to Philip W. Anderson , the term "condensed matter" appeared about 1965.
