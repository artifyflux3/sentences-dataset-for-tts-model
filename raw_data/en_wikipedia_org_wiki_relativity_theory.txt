The **theory of relativity** usually encompasses two interrelated [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics") theories by [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein"): [special relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity "Special relativity") and [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity"), proposed and published in 1905 and 1915, respectively.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_theory#cite_note-1) Special relativity applies to all physical phenomena in the absence of [gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity "Gravity"). General relativity explains the law of gravitation and its relation to the forces of nature.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_theory#cite_note-londontimes-2) It applies to the [cosmological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological "Cosmological") and astrophysical realm, including astronomy.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_theory#cite_note-relativity-3)

The theory transformed [theoretical physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_physics "Theoretical physics") and [astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy "Astronomy") during the 20th century, superseding a 200-year-old [theory of mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics "Classical mechanics") created primarily by [Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_theory#cite_note-relativity-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_theory#cite_note-spacetime-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_theory#cite_note-fitz-loren-5) It introduced concepts including 4-[dimensional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension "Dimension")[spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime "Spacetime") as a unified entity of [space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space "Space") and [time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_physics "Time in physics"), [relativity of simultaneity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_of_simultaneity "Relativity of simultaneity"), [kinematic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinematics "Kinematics") and [gravitational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity "Gravity")[time dilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_dilation "Time dilation"), and [length contraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_contraction "Length contraction"). In the field of physics, relativity improved the science of [elementary particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_particle "Elementary particle") and their fundamental interactions, along with ushering in the [nuclear age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_age "Atomic age"). With relativity, [cosmology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_cosmology "Physical cosmology") and [astrophysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics "Astrophysics") predicted extraordinary [astronomical phenomena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy "Astronomy") such as [neutron stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_star "Neutron star"), [black holes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole "Black hole"), and [gravitational waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_wave "Gravitational wave").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_theory#cite_note-relativity-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_theory#cite_note-spacetime-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_theory#cite_note-fitz-loren-5)

Development and acceptance
--------------------------

[Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein") published the theory of [special relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity "Special relativity") in 1905, building on many theoretical results and empirical findings obtained by [Albert A. Michelson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_A._Michelson "Albert A. Michelson"), [Hendrik Lorentz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hendrik_Lorentz "Hendrik Lorentz"), [Henri Poincaré](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Poincar%C3%A9 "Henri Poincaré") and others. [Max Planck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Planck "Max Planck"), [Hermann Minkowski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Minkowski "Hermann Minkowski") and others did subsequent work.

Einstein developed [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity") between 1907 and 1915, with contributions by many others after 1915. The final form of general relativity was published in 1916.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_theory#cite_note-relativity-3)

The term "theory of relativity" was based on the expression "relative theory" ([German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language "German language"): _Relativtheorie_) used in 1906 by Planck, who emphasized how the theory uses the [principle of relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_relativity "Principle of relativity"). In the discussion section of the same paper, [Alfred Bucherer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Bucherer "Alfred Bucherer") used for the first time the expression "theory of relativity" ([German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language "German language"): _Relativitätstheorie_).[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_theory#cite_note-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_theory#cite_note-7)

By the 1920s, the physics community understood and accepted special relativity.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_theory#cite_note-8) It rapidly became a significant and necessary tool for theorists and experimentalists in the new fields of [atomic physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_physics "Atomic physics"), [nuclear physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_physics "Nuclear physics"), and [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics").

By comparison, general relativity did not appear to be as useful, beyond making minor corrections to predictions of Newtonian gravitation theory.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_theory#cite_note-relativity-3) It seemed to offer little potential for experimental test, as most of its assertions were on an astronomical scale. Its [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_analysis "Tensor analysis") seemed difficult and fully understandable only by a small number of people. Around 1960, general relativity became central to physics and astronomy. New mathematical techniques to apply to general relativity streamlined calculations and made its concepts more easily visualized. As astronomical [phenomena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomena "Phenomena") were discovered, such as [quasars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasars "Quasars") (1963), the 3-kelvin [microwave background radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave_background_radiation "Microwave background radiation") (1965), [pulsars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulsar "Pulsar") (1967), and the first [black hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole "Black hole") candidates (1981),[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_theory#cite_note-relativity-3) the theory explained their attributes, and measurement of them further confirmed the theory.

Special relativity
------------------

[![Image 2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Einstein_Portrait.png/250px-Einstein_Portrait.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Einstein_Portrait.png)

Albert Einstein, physicist, 1879-1955, Graphic: Heikenwaelder Hugo,1999

Special relativity is a theory of the structure of [spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime "Spacetime"). It was introduced in Einstein's 1905 paper "[On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Electrodynamics_of_Moving_Bodies "On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies")" (for the contributions of many other physicists and mathematicians, see [History of special relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_special_relativity "History of special relativity")). Special relativity is based on two postulates which are contradictory in [classical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics "Classical mechanics"):

1.   The [laws of physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_of_physics "Laws of physics") are the same for all observers in any [inertial frame of reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_frame_of_reference "Inertial frame of reference") relative to one another ([principle of relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_relativity "Principle of relativity")).
2.   The [speed of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light "Speed of light") in [vacuum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum "Vacuum") is the same for all observers, regardless of their relative motion or of the motion of the [light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light "Light") source.

The resultant theory copes with experiment better than classical mechanics. For instance, postulate 2 explains the results of the [Michelson–Morley experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelson%E2%80%93Morley_experiment "Michelson–Morley experiment"). Moreover, the theory has many surprising and counterintuitive consequences. Some of these are:

*   [Relativity of simultaneity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_of_simultaneity "Relativity of simultaneity"): Two events, simultaneous for one observer, may not be simultaneous for another observer if the observers are in relative motion.
*   [Time dilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_dilation "Time dilation"): Moving [clocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock "Clock") are measured to tick more slowly than an observer's "stationary" clock.
*   [Length contraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_contraction "Length contraction"): Objects are measured to be shortened in the direction that they are moving with respect to the observer.
*   [Maximum speed is finite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light#Upper_limit_on_speeds "Speed of light"): No physical object, message or field line can travel faster than the speed of light in vacuum. 
    *   The effect of gravity can only travel through space at the speed of light, not faster or instantaneously.

*   [Mass–energy equivalence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass%E2%80%93energy_equivalence "Mass–energy equivalence"): _E_ = _mc_ 2, energy and mass are equivalent and transmutable.
*   [Relativistic mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_in_special_relativity "Mass in special relativity"), idea used by some researchers.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_theory#cite_note-:0-9)

The defining feature of special relativity is the replacement of the [Galilean transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galilean_transformation "Galilean transformation") of classical mechanics by the [Lorentz transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_transformation "Lorentz transformation"). (See [Maxwell's equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations "Maxwell's equations") of [electromagnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetism "Electromagnetism").)

General relativity
------------------

General relativity is a theory of gravitation developed by Einstein in the years 1907–1915. The development of general relativity began with the [equivalence principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_principle "Equivalence principle"), under which the states of [accelerated motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerated_motion "Accelerated motion") and being at rest in a [gravitational field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity "Gravity") (for example, when standing on the surface of the Earth) are physically identical. The upshot of this is that [free fall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_fall "Free fall") is [inertial motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertia "Inertia"): an object in free fall is falling because that is how objects move when there is no [force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force "Force") being exerted on them, instead of this being due to the force of [gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity "Gravity") as is the case in [classical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics "Classical mechanics"). This is incompatible with classical mechanics and [special relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity "Special relativity") because in those theories inertially moving objects cannot accelerate with respect to each other, but objects in free fall do so. To resolve this difficulty Einstein first proposed that [spacetime is curved](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curved_space "Curved space"). Einstein discussed his idea with mathematician [Marcel Grossmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Grossmann "Marcel Grossmann") and they concluded that general relativity could be formulated in the context of [Riemannian geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_geometry "Riemannian geometry") which had been developed in the 1800s.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_theory#cite_note-10) In 1915, he devised the [Einstein field equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_field_equations "Einstein field equations") which relate the curvature of spacetime with the mass, energy, and any momentum within it.

Some of the consequences of general relativity are:

*   [Gravitational time dilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_time_dilation "Gravitational time dilation"): Clocks run slower in deeper gravitational wells.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_theory#cite_note-11)
*   [Precession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precession#Relativistic_(Einsteinian) "Precession"): Orbits precess in a way unexpected in Newton's theory of gravity. (This has been observed in the orbit of [Mercury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(planet) "Mercury (planet)") and in [binary pulsars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_pulsar "Binary pulsar")).
*   [Light deflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity#Light_deflection_and_gravitational_time_delay "General relativity"): Rays of [light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light "Light") bend in the presence of a gravitational field.
*   [Frame-dragging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame-dragging "Frame-dragging"): Rotating masses "drag along" the [spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime "Spacetime") around them.
*   [Expansion of the universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansion_of_the_universe "Expansion of the universe"): The universe is expanding, and certain components within the universe can [accelerate the expansion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerated_expansion "Accelerated expansion").

Technically, general relativity is a theory of [gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitation "Gravitation") whose defining feature is its use of the [Einstein field equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_field_equations "Einstein field equations"). The solutions of the field equations are [metric tensors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_tensor_(general_relativity) "Metric tensor (general relativity)") which define the [topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology "Topology") of the spacetime and how objects move inertially.

Experimental evidence
---------------------

Einstein explained that the theory of relativity falls under a category of scientific frameworks known as "principle-theories"—theories that start not from speculative constructs or imagined mechanisms, but from well-established empirical facts and observed regularities in nature. Unlike constructive theories, which attempt to build models of phenomena from assumed underlying processes, principle-theories, such as relativity, adopt an analytic approach: they begin with experimentally verified principles and work deductively to uncover the logical consequences and constraints that any physical process must obey. By observing natural processes, we understand their general characteristics, devise mathematical models to describe what we observed, and by analytical means we deduce the necessary conditions that have to be satisfied. Measurement of separate events must satisfy these conditions and match the theory's conclusions.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_theory#cite_note-londontimes-2)

### Tests of special relativity

[![Image 3](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Michelson-Morley_experiment_%28en%29.svg/250px-Michelson-Morley_experiment_%28en%29.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Michelson-Morley_experiment_(en).svg)

A diagram of the [Michelson–Morley experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelson%E2%80%93Morley_experiment "Michelson–Morley experiment")

Relativity is a [falsifiable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability "Falsifiability") theory: It makes predictions that can be tested by experiment. In the case of special relativity, these include the principle of relativity, the constancy of the speed of light, and time dilation.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_theory#cite_note-faq-12) The predictions of special relativity have been confirmed in numerous tests since Einstein published his paper in 1905, but three experiments conducted between 1881 and 1938 were critical to its validation. These are the [Michelson–Morley experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelson%E2%80%93Morley_experiment "Michelson–Morley experiment"), the [Kennedy–Thorndike experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy%E2%80%93Thorndike_experiment "Kennedy–Thorndike experiment"), and the [Ives–Stilwell experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ives%E2%80%93Stilwell_experiment "Ives–Stilwell experiment"). Einstein derived the [Lorentz transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_transformation "Lorentz transformation") from first principles in 1905, but these three experiments allow the transformations to be induced from experimental evidence.

[Maxwell's equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations "Maxwell's equations")—the foundation of classical electromagnetism—describe light as a wave that moves with a characteristic velocity. The modern view is that light needs no medium of transmission, but Maxwell and his contemporaries were convinced that light waves were propagated in a medium, analogous to sound propagating in air, and ripples propagating on the surface of a pond. This hypothetical medium was called the [luminiferous aether](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminiferous_aether "Luminiferous aether"), at rest relative to the "fixed stars" and through which the Earth moves. Fresnel's [partial ether dragging hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aether_drag_hypothesis#Partial_aether_dragging "Aether drag hypothesis") ruled out the measurement of first-order (v/c) effects, and although observations of second-order effects (v 2/c 2) were possible in principle, Maxwell thought they were too small to be detected with then-current technology.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_theory#cite_note-maxb-13)[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_theory#cite_note-Pais_1982_111%E2%80%93113-14)

The Michelson–Morley experiment was designed to detect second-order effects of the "aether wind"—the motion of the aether relative to the Earth. Michelson designed an instrument called the [Michelson interferometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelson_interferometer "Michelson interferometer") to accomplish this. The apparatus was sufficiently accurate to detect the expected effects, but he obtained a null result when the first experiment was conducted in 1881,[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_theory#cite_note-michel1-15) and again in 1887.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_theory#cite_note-michel2-16) Although the failure to detect an aether wind was a disappointment, the results were accepted by the scientific community.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_theory#cite_note-Pais_1982_111%E2%80%93113-14) In an attempt to salvage the aether paradigm, FitzGerald and Lorentz independently created an [_ad hoc_ hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hoc_hypothesis "Ad hoc hypothesis") in which the length of material bodies changes according to their motion through the aether.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_theory#cite_note-17) This was the origin of [FitzGerald–Lorentz contraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FitzGerald%E2%80%93Lorentz_contraction "FitzGerald–Lorentz contraction"), and their hypothesis had no theoretical basis. The interpretation of the null result of the Michelson–Morley experiment is that the round-trip travel time for light is [isotropic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotropic "Isotropic") (independent of direction), but the result alone is not enough to discount the theory of the aether or validate the predictions of special relativity.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_theory#cite_note-robertson-18)[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_theory#cite_note-tw-19)

[![Image 4](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Kennedy-Thorndike_experiment_DE.svg/250px-Kennedy-Thorndike_experiment_DE.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Kennedy-Thorndike_experiment_DE.svg)

The [Kennedy–Thorndike experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy%E2%80%93Thorndike_experiment "Kennedy–Thorndike experiment") shown with interference fringes

While the Michelson–Morley experiment showed that the velocity of light is isotropic, it said nothing about how the magnitude of the velocity changed (if at all) in different [inertial frames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_frame "Inertial frame"). The Kennedy–Thorndike experiment was designed to do that, and was first performed in 1932 by Roy Kennedy and Edward Thorndike.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_theory#cite_note-KT-20) They obtained a null result, and concluded that "there is no effect ... unless the velocity of the solar system in space is no more than about half that of the earth in its orbit".[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_theory#cite_note-tw-19)[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_theory#cite_note-21) That possibility was thought to be too coincidental to provide an acceptable explanation, so from the null result of their experiment it was concluded that the round-trip time for light is the same in all inertial reference frames.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_theory#cite_note-robertson-18)[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_theory#cite_note-tw-19)

The Ives–Stilwell experiment was carried out by Herbert Ives and G.R. Stilwell first in 1938[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_theory#cite_note-22) and with better accuracy in 1941.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_theory#cite_note-Ives1941-23) It was designed to test the [transverse Doppler effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transverse_Doppler_effect "Transverse Doppler effect")– the [redshift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift "Redshift") of light from a moving source in a direction perpendicular to its velocity—which had been predicted by Einstein in 1905. The strategy was to compare observed Doppler shifts with what was predicted by classical theory, and look for a [Lorentz factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_factor "Lorentz factor") correction. Such a correction was observed, from which was concluded that the frequency of a moving atomic clock is altered according to special relativity.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_theory#cite_note-robertson-18)[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_theory#cite_note-tw-19)

Those classic experiments have been repeated many times with increased precision. Other experiments include, for instance, [relativistic energy and momentum increase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tests_of_relativistic_energy_and_momentum "Tests of relativistic energy and momentum") at high velocities, [experimental testing of time dilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_testing_of_time_dilation "Experimental testing of time dilation"), and [modern searches for Lorentz violations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_searches_for_Lorentz_violation "Modern searches for Lorentz violation").[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

### Tests of general relativity

General relativity has also been confirmed many times, the classic experiments being the perihelion precession of [Mercury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(planet) "Mercury (planet)")'s orbit, the [deflection of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_lens "Gravitational lens") by the [Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun "Sun"), and the [gravitational redshift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_redshift "Gravitational redshift") of light. Other tests confirmed the [equivalence principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_principle "Equivalence principle") and [frame dragging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_dragging "Frame dragging").

Modern applications
-------------------

Far from being simply of theoretical interest, relativistic effects are important practical engineering concerns. Satellite-based measurement needs to take into account relativistic effects, as each satellite is in motion relative to an Earth-bound user, and is thus in a different frame of reference under the theory of relativity. Global positioning systems such as [GPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS "GPS"), [GLONASS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLONASS "GLONASS"), and [Galileo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_(satellite_navigation) "Galileo (satellite navigation)"), must account for all of the relativistic effects in order to work with precision, such as the consequences of the Earth's gravitational field.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_theory#cite_note-24) This is also the case in the high-precision measurement of time.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_theory#cite_note-Francis2002-25) Instruments ranging from electron microscopes to particle accelerators would not work if relativistic considerations were omitted.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_theory#cite_note-26)
