In set theory , the topological space 2 ω is called "the" Cantor space.

Examples [ edit ] The Cantor set itself is a Cantor space.  But the canonical example of a Cantor space is the countably infinite topological product of the discrete 2-point space {0, 1}.  This is usually written as 2 N {\displaystyle 2^{\mathbb {N} }} or 2 ω (where 2 denotes the 2-element set {0,1} with the discrete topology ). A point in 2 ω is an infinite binary sequence, that is a sequence that assumes only the values 0 or 1.  Given such a sequence a 0 , a 1 , a 2 ,...,  one can map it to the real number ∑ ∑ n = 0 ∞ ∞ 2 a n 3 n + 1 .

{\displaystyle \sum _{n=0}^{\infty }{\frac {2a_{n}}{3^{n+1}}}.} This mapping gives a homeomorphism from 2 ω onto the Cantor set, demonstrating that 2 ω is indeed a Cantor space.

Cantor spaces occur abundantly in real analysis . For example, they exist as subspaces in every perfect , complete metric space .  (To see this, note that in such a space, any non-empty perfect set contains two disjoint non-empty perfect subsets of arbitrarily small diameter, and so one can imitate the construction
of the usual Cantor set .)  Also, every uncountable , separable , completely metrizable space contains
Cantor spaces as subspaces.  This includes most of the common spaces in real analysis.

Characterization [ edit ] A topological characterization of Cantor spaces is given by Brouwer 's theorem: [ 1 ] Brouwer's theorem — Any two non-empty compact Hausdorff spaces without isolated points and having countable bases consisting of clopen sets are homeomorphic to each other.

The topological property of having a base consisting of clopen sets is sometimes known as " zero-dimensionality ". Brouwer's theorem can be restated as: Theorem — A topological space is a Cantor space if and only if it is non-empty, perfect , compact, totally disconnected , and metrizable .

This theorem is also equivalent (via Stone's representation theorem for Boolean algebras ) to the fact that any two countable atomless Boolean algebras are isomorphic .

Properties [ edit ] As can be expected from Brouwer's theorem, Cantor spaces appear in several forms.  But many properties of Cantor spaces can be established using 2 ω , because its construction as a product makes it amenable to analysis.

Cantor spaces have the following properties: The cardinality of any Cantor space is 2 ℵ ℵ 0 {\displaystyle 2^{\aleph _{0}}} , that is, the cardinality of the continuum .

The product of two (or even any finite or countable number of) Cantor spaces is a Cantor space. Along with the Cantor function , this fact can be used to construct space-filling curves .

A (non-empty) Hausdorff topological space is compact metrizable if and only if it is a continuous image of a Cantor space.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Let C ( X ) denote the space of all real-valued, bounded continuous functions on a topological space X . Let K denote a compact metric space , and Δ denote the Cantor set. Then the Cantor set has the following property: C ( K ) is isometric to a closed subspace of C (Δ).

[ 5 ] In general, this isometry is not unique, and thus is not properly a universal property in the categorical sense.

The group of all homeomorphisms of the Cantor space is simple .
