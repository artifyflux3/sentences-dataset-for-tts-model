A laser experiment on an optical table Laser modules (bottom to top: 405, 445, 520, 532, 635, and 660 nm) Laser science or laser physics is a branch of optics that describes the theory and practice of lasers .

[ 1 ] Laser science is principally concerned with quantum electronics , laser construction , optical cavity design, the physics of producing a population inversion in laser media , and the temporal evolution of the light field in the laser. It is also concerned with the physics of laser beam propagation, particularly the physics of Gaussian beams , with laser applications , and with associated fields such as nonlinear optics and quantum optics .

History [ edit ] See also: Laser Laser science predates the invention of the laser itself.

Albert Einstein created the foundations for the laser and maser in 1917, via a paper in which he re-derived Max Planck ’s law of radiation using a formalism based on probability coefficients ( Einstein coefficients ) for the absorption , spontaneous emission , and stimulated emission of electromagnetic radiation.

[ 2 ] The existence of stimulated emission was confirmed in 1928 by Rudolf W. Ladenburg .

[ 3 ] In 1939, Valentin A. Fabrikant made the earliest laser proposal. He specified the conditions required for light amplification using stimulated emission.

[ 4 ] In 1947, Willis E. Lamb and R. C. Retherford found apparent stimulated emission in hydrogen spectra and effected the first demonstration of stimulated emission; [ 3 ] in 1950, Alfred Kastler (Nobel Prize for Physics 1966) proposed the method of optical pumping , experimentally confirmed, two years later, by Brossel, Kastler, and Winter.

[ 5 ] The theoretical principles describing the operation of a microwave laser (a maser) were first described by Nikolay Basov and Alexander Prokhorov at the All-Union Conference on Radio Spectroscopy in May 1952. The first maser was built by Charles H. Townes , James P. Gordon , and Herbert J. Zeiger in 1953. Townes, Basov and Prokhorov were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1964 for their research in the field of stimulated emission.

Arthur Ashkin , Gérard Mourou , and Donna Strickland were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2018 for groundbreaking inventions in the field of laser physics.

[ 6 ] The first working laser (a pulsed ruby laser ) was demonstrated on May 16, 1960, by Theodore Maiman at the Hughes Research Laboratories .
