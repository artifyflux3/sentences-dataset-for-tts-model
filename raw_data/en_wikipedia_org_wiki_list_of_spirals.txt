For ρ ρ < 1 {\displaystyle \rho <1} , spiral-ring pattern; ρ ρ = 1 , {\displaystyle \rho =1,} regular spiral; ρ ρ > 1 , {\displaystyle \rho >1,} loose spiral. R is the distance of spiral starting point (0, R) to the center. The calculated x and y have to be rotated backward by ( − − θ θ {\displaystyle -\theta } ) for plotting.
