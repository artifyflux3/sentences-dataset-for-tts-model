[ 1 ] Wendy McElroy speaking in Springfield, Illinois , September 16, 2006 McElroy is the author of the book Rape Culture Hysteria , in which she contends that rape culture is a result of popular hysteria to the disadvantage of men, and in particular, white men.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] In November 2014, McElroy was scheduled to debate Jessica Valenti at a Brown University Janus Forum debate on "How Should Colleges Handle Sexual Assault?". Before the debate, Brown President Christina Paxson sent out a campus-wide e-mail saying she disagreed with McElroy's views, and set up an alternative event at the same time to compete with the debate.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] The actions of Brown students and Paxson were criticized by various commentators.
