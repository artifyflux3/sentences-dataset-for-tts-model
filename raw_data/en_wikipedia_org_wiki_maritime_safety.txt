The executive institutions are the national and transnational maritime administrations .

maritime accidents , while characterized by a level of safety of the order of 10 −5 (1 serious accident per 100,000 movements), which is only slightly inferior to that of the field of air transportation (10 −6 ) are a significant source of risk for insurance companies , transport companies and property owners.

[ 1 ] Beyond that, of course, ship owners and maritime institutions have to ensure that casualties at sea (mostly by drowning ) are kept to the possible minimum. Organizational and human factors are critical antecedents to accidents such as MV Prestige , Herald of Free Enterprise , MS Sleipner , MS Estonia , Bow Mariner and Hoegh Osaka as well as the infamous Titanic .

[ 2 ] Technology and innovation [ edit ] In recent years, advances in sensor fusion, artificial intelligence and computer vision have led to the development of predictive safety systems, including Maritime Collision Avoidance Systems , aimed at reducing maritime accidents. AI-powered platforms such as Sea.AI and Watchit.ai assist in identifying non-cooperative objects (e.g., floating debris, small vessels) and alerting operators in real time to potential collision risks, particularly in recreational and coastal navigation contexts.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] International regulation [ edit ] International maritime safety is primarily governed by a set of conventions and codes developed by the International Maritime Organization (IMO), a specialized agency of the United Nations . The cornerstone of this regulatory framework is the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), first adopted in 1914 in response to the sinking of the Titanic . SOLAS establishes minimum safety standards for ship construction, equipment, and operations. Complementary agreements such as the International Safety Management Code (ISM Code), the Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs), the Maritime Labour Convention (MLC), and the International Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue (SAR Convention) contribute to a comprehensive global safety regime. National maritime authorities are responsible for implementing and enforcing these standards, often through classification societies and flag state controls.

The emergence of advanced technologies, particularly in artificial intelligence and autonomous navigation, is reshaping the regulatory landscape. Maritime Collision Avoidance Systems (MCAS), powered by AI and real-time sensor fusion, are increasingly deployed to detect potential hazards and prevent collisions, especially in busy coastal waters and recreational zones. While such systems offer enhanced situational awareness, they also introduce complex legal and operational questions regarding certification, liability, and integration into traditional navigation protocols. The IMO is actively addressing these challenges through its Maritime Safety Committee, working to adapt existing conventions and develop new guidance for Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships (MASS) and next-generation safety technologies.
