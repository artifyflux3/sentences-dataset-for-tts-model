He received his B.A. in physics from the University of Cambridge in 1979, and obtained his Ph.D. from MIT in 1983. Kardar is particularly known for the Kardar–Parisi–Zhang (KPZ) equation [ 1 ] in theoretical physics , which has been named after him and his two coauthors: the Nobel Prize laureate Giorgio Parisi , and Yi-Cheng Zhang. He was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 2001.
