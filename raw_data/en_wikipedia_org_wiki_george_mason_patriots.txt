The Patriots compete in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) as members of the Atlantic 10 Conference for most sports.

History [ edit ] The Patriots began to move from NAIA and NCAA Division II status into the NCAA Division I ranks with men's basketball in the 1978–1979 season. According to the History of George Mason basketball , both the men's and women's basketball program have been fixtures of campus life. Within a few years, all other sports also were elevated to Division I status. George Mason reached its current level of 20 varsity sports with the addition of women's lacrosse (1993–1994), women's rowing (1997–1998) and men's and women's swimming & diving (1999–2000). In addition, George Mason has fielded a varsity club football team since 1993 that competes intercollegiately. Their opponents range from other club teams to NCAA Division I FCS programs. GMU was a founding member of the CAA but joined the Atlantic 10 in 2013.

The menʼs basketball team has played at the Patriot Center since 1985 after playing prior seasons in the PE Building on the west side of the Fairfax Campus. The menʼs basketball team has made the NCAA tournament six times ( 1989 , 1999 , 2001 , 2006 , 2008 , and 2011 ) and the NIT tournament five times (1986, 2002, 2004, 2009 and 2025). The Patriot basketball team is most famous for its 2006 NCAA run to the Final Four. GMU beat perennial powers UNC , Connecticut , and Michigan State , as well as a highly ranked Wichita State team, before losing to eventual National Champion Florida in the Final Four.

The programʼs largest rivals include conference foes George Washington and Virginia Commonwealth . New rivalries are forming via George Masonʼs admission to the A-10.

The best-known player in Patriots history is George Evans , a Gulf War veteran who played from 1997 to 2001 and was a CAA player of year three consecutive seasons.  He shares the CAA record with NBA legend David Robinson for winning the award three straight times. Other Patriot standouts include Andre Gaddy , Carlos Yates , Kenny Sanders , Curtis McCants , Nate Langley , Robert Dykes , Robert Rose , Jason Miskiri , Jai Lewis , Lamar Butler , Tony Skinn , Gabe Norwood , Folarin Campbell , and Will Thomas .
