Eugène Sue Portrait of Sue in 1835 Born Joseph Marie Eugène Sue ( 1804-01-26 ) 26 January 1804 Paris , France Died 3 August 1857 (1857-08-03) (aged 53) Annecy-le-Vieux , Kingdom of Sardinia Resting place Cimetière de Loverchy, Annecy Occupation Novelist Education Lycée Condorcet Period 1830–1857 Literary movement Romanticism Notable works The Mysteries of Paris , The Wandering Jew Notable awards Legion of Honour Marie-Joseph " Eugène " Sue ( French pronunciation: [øʒɛn sy] ; 26 January 1804 – 3 August 1857) was a French novelist. He was one of several authors who popularized the genre of the serial novel in France with his very popular and widely imitated The Mysteries of Paris , which was published in a newspaper from 1842 to 1843.

[ 1 ] Early life [ edit ] Sue was born in Paris, France. He was the son of a distinguished surgeon in Napoleon 's army, Jean-Joseph Sue , and had Empress Joséphine as his godmother.

[ 2 ] Sue himself acted as surgeon both in the 1823 French campaign in Spain and at the Battle of Navarino in 1827.

[ 3 ] In 1829 his father's death put him in possession of a considerable fortune, and he settled in Paris.

[ 4 ] Literary career [ edit ] Sue's naval experiences supplied much of the material for his first novels, Kernock le pirate (1830), Atar-Gull (1831), La Salamandre (1832), La Coucaratcha (1832–1834), and others, written at the height of the Romantic movement of 1830 . In the quasi-historical style he wrote Jean Cavalier, ou Les Fanatiques des Cevennes (1840) and Latréaumont (1837).

[ 4 ] His Mathilde (1841 [ 5 ] ) contains the first known expression of the popular proverb " La vengeance se mange très-bien froide ", [ 5 ] translated in 1846 as " Revenge is very good eaten cold " by D. G. Osborne, [ 6 ] also constituting the first known English usage of the proverb later expressed in English as "Revenge is a dish best served cold" .

[ 7 ] He was strongly affected by the socialist ideas of the day, and these prompted his most famous works, the anti-Catholic novels: The Mysteries of Paris ( Les Mystères de Paris ) (published in Journal des débats from 19 June 1842 until 15 October 1843) and The Wandering Jew ( Le Juif errant ; 1844–1845), which were among the most popular specimens of the serial novel .

[ 4 ] [ 8 ] The Wandering Jew is a Gothic novel depicting the titular character in conflict with the villain, a murderous Jesuit named Rodin.

[ 1 ] These works depicted the intrigues of the nobility and the harsh life of the underclass to a wide public.

Les Mystères de Paris spawned a class of imitations all over the world, the city mysteries . Sue's books caused controversy because of their strongly violent scenes, and also because of their socialist and anti-clerical subtexts.

[ 1 ] He followed up with some singular books: Les Sept pêchés capitaux (1847–1849) contained stories to illustrate each of the seven deadly sins ; [ 4 ] Les Mystères du peuple (1849–1856),
a long series of historical novels which was suppressed by the censor in 1857; and several others, all on a very large scale, though the number of volumes gives an exaggerated idea of their length.

[ 4 ] Les Mystères du peuple is a lengthy series of novels and novellas dealing with French history.

Les Mystères du peuple begins with a novel graphically depicting slavery in the Roman Empire ( The Iron Collar ).

[ 1 ] Other Les Mystères du peuple novels dealt with Early Christianity ( The Silver Cross ), King Clovis I ( The Poniard's Hilt ), the founding of the Duchy of Normandy ( The Iron Arrow-Head ), the Crusades in Palestine ( The Pilgrim's Shell ), the Albigensian Crusade ( The Iron Pincers ), the Jacquerie ( The Iron Trevet ), Joan of Arc ( The Executioner's Knife ) and the French Revolution ( Sword of Honor ). The novels were translated into English (as the "Mysteries of the People") and published in New York by Daniel De Leon and his son, Solon .

[ 1 ] [ 9 ] Some of Sue's books, among them The Wandering Jew and The Mysteries of Paris , were dramatized by himself, usually in collaboration with others. His period of greatest success and popularity coincided with that of Alexandre Dumas , with whom he has been compared.

[ 4 ] According to Umberto Eco , parts of Sue's book Les Mystères du peuple served as a source for Maurice Joly in his 1864 work Dialogue in Hell Between Machiavelli and Montesquieu , a book attacking Napoleon III and his political ambitions. The two are depicted in Will Eisner 's cartoon book The Plot , co-authored with Eco.

[ 10 ] Political career [ edit ] After the French Revolution of 1848 , Sue was elected to the Legislative Assembly from the Paris-Seine constituency in April 1850. He was exiled from Paris in consequence of his protest against the French coup d'état of 1851 . This exile stimulated his literary production.

[ 4 ] Sue died in Annecy-le-Vieux , Savoy on 3 August 1857 and was buried at the Cimetière de Loverchy ( Annecy ) in the Non-Catholic's Carré des "Dissidents".

Legacy [ edit ] Rue Eugène Sue in the 18th arrondissement of Paris near the Marcadet-Poissonniers station of the Paris Métro , not far from Montmartre and the Sacré-Cœur .

Calle Eugenio Sue in Polanco .

Sue is a character in Umberto Eco 's 2010 novel The Prague Cemetery .
