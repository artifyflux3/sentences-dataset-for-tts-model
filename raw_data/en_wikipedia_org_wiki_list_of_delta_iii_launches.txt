The first Delta III launch was on August 26, 1998.

[ 1 ] Of its three flights, the first two were failures, and the third, though declared successful, reached the low end of its targeted orbit range and carried only a dummy (inert) payload. The Delta III could deliver up to 8,400 pounds (3,800 kilograms) to geostationary transfer orbit , twice the payload of its predecessor, the Delta II .

[ 2 ] Under the four-digit designation system from earlier Delta rockets, the Delta III is classified as the Delta 8930.
