SI units ≈ 1.355 818 N⋅m [ 1 ] Gravitational metric system ≈ 0.1382550 kgf⋅m A pound-foot ( lb⋅ft ), abbreviated from pound-force foot ( lbf · ft ), is a unit of torque representing one pound of force acting at a perpendicular distance of one foot from a pivot point.

[ 2 ] Conversely one foot pound-force (ft · lbf) is the moment about an axis that applies one pound-force at a radius of one foot.

Unit [ edit ] The value in Système International (SI) units is given by multiplying the following exact factors: One pound (mass) = 0.453 592 37 kilograms [ 1 ] Standard gravity = 9.80665 m/s 2 [ 1 ] One foot = 0.3048 m [ 1 ] This gives the exact conversion factor: One pound-foot = 1.355 817 948 331 400 4 newton metres .

The name "pound-foot", intended to minimize confusion with the foot-pound as a unit of work , was apparently first proposed by British physicist Arthur Mason Worthington .

[ 3 ] Despite this, in practice torque units are commonly called the foot-pound (denoted as either lb-ft or ft-lb) or the inch-pound (denoted as in-lb).

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] Practitioners depend on context and the hyphenated abbreviations to know that these refer to neither energy nor moment of mass (as the symbol ft-lb rather than lbf-ft would imply).

Similarly, an inch-pound (or pound-inch ) is the torque of one pound of force applied to one inch of distance from the pivot, and is equal to 1 ⁄ 12 lbf⋅ft (0.1129848 N⋅m).  It is commonly used on torque wrenches and torque screwdrivers for setting specific fastener tension. An inch-ounce is a smaller unit, equal to 1 ⁄ 16 of an inch-pound.
