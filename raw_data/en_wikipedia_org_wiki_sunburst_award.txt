A young adult category was created in 2008, to differentiate from adult works; and a short fiction award as well. The award has been on hiatus since 2020.

History [ edit ] The name of the award comes from the title of the first novel by Phyllis Gotlieb , Sunburst (1964).

The first award was given out in 2001. The award consists of a cash prize ( CA$ 1,000 for novel length work, and CA$ 500 for short stories) and a medallion. The winner is selected by jury; a new jury is struck each year.

On 2 June 2020, the Sunburst Award Society announced the awards were going on a hiatus due to impacts related to COVID-19.

[ 1 ] Winners [ edit ] General [ edit ] Prior to 2008, the Sunburst Award was presented in a single category. In later years, it was broken down into two or three categories, including adult, young adult, and short story.
