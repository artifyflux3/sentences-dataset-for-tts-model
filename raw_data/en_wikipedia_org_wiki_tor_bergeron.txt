Born 15 August 1891 Godstone , Surrey , England Died 13 June 1977 ( 1977-06-14 ) (aged 85) Uppsala , Sweden Nationality Swedish Known for Bergeron Process Awards Symons Gold Medal (1949) International Meteorological Organization Prize (1966) Scientific career Fields Meteorology Tor Bergeron [ pronunciation?

] (15 August 1891 – 13 June 1977) was a Swedish meteorologist who proposed a mechanism for the formation of precipitation in clouds . In the 1930s, Bergeron and Walter Findeisen [ fr ] developed the concept that clouds contain both supercooled water and ice crystals. According to Bergeron, most precipitation is formed as a consequence of water evaporating from small supercooled droplets and accreting onto ice crystals, which then fall as snow , or melt and fall as cold rain depending on the ambient air temperature. This process is known as the Bergeron Process , and is believed to be the primary process by which precipitation is formed.

Bergeron was one of the principal scientists in the Bergen School of Meteorology , which transformed this science by introducing a new conceptual foundation for understanding and predicting weather. While developing innovative methods of forecasting, the Bergen scientists established the notion of weather fronts and elaborated a new model of extratropical cyclones that accounted for their birth, growth, and decay. Bergeron is credited with discovering the occlusion process , which marks the final stage in the life cycle of an extratropical cyclone .

In 1949 he was awarded the Symons Gold Medal of the Royal Meteorological Society .

[ 1 ] In 1966 he was awarded the prestigious International Meteorological Organization Prize from the World Meteorological Organization .
