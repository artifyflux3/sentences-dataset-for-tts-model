[ 1 ] The concept was coined by the Italian Germanist Claudio Magris in his 1963 thesis Il mito asburgico nella letteratura austriaca moderna ("The Habsburg myth in modern Austrian literature").

[ 2 ] Some important novelists that helped the emergence of what is nowadays referred to as the Habsburg myth were Stefan Zweig and Joseph Roth .

[ 3 ] A possible correlation has been made between the Habsburg myth and the rise of fascism in parts of Europe in the 20th century.

[ 4 ] It has also been related to the current European Union (EU), as some early proponents of European integration and a pan-European identity were inspired in the supranational multiethnic Habsburg Monarchy.
