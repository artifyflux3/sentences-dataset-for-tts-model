The duo had a [top 10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_40 "Top 40")[UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom "United Kingdom")[hit single](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_single "Hit single") with an electronic [cover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_version "Cover version") of [the Beatles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles "The Beatles")' "[Strawberry Fields Forever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strawberry_Fields_Forever "Strawberry Fields Forever")" in 1990.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candy_Flip#cite_note-Larkin90-3) The track [sampled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music) "Sampling (music)") the drum beat from [James Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Brown "James Brown")'s "[Funky Drummer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funky_Drummer "Funky Drummer")",[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candy_Flip#cite_note-7) overdubbing a [hi hat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hi-hat_(instrument) "Hi-hat (instrument)") and heavy [reverb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverb "Reverb"). Candy Flip's track was initially a [club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightclub "Nightclub") hit on the [rave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rave "Rave") scene before crossing over into the pop chart.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candy_Flip#cite_note-Larkin90-3) The track was reissued on [vinyl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record "Gramophone record") in 2005 on S12 Records. The UK [DJ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disc_jockey "Disc jockey")[remix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remix "Remix") service [Disco Mix Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disco_Mix_Club "Disco Mix Club") remixed the Candy Flip version, removing the beat and adding an [interpolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpolation_(popular_music) "Interpolation (popular music)") of "[Hey Jude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hey_Jude "Hey Jude")" to the outro.

The [B-side](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-side_and_B-side "A-side and B-side") of the first [12" single](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12%22_single "12\" single") contained another electronic track entitled "Can You Feel the Love".[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candy_Flip#cite_note-Larkin90-3) A second 12" single release featured the 'Raspberry Ripple Remix' of the lead track backed by "Rhythim of Love" (_[sic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sic "Sic")_).

In 1991, Candy Flip released their first [album](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Album "Album"), _[Madstock...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madstock... "Madstock...")_,[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candy_Flip#cite_note-Larkin90-3) which combined rave beats with [synthpop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthpop "Synthpop"), strongly influenced by bands such as the [Pet Shop Boys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet_Shop_Boys "Pet Shop Boys"), [New Order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Order_(band) "New Order (band)") and [the Beloved](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beloved_(band) "The Beloved (band)").[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] A further two [singles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music) "Single (music)") were released, the first being "Space" which made UK No. 98 and "This Can Be Real", which fared slightly better, reaching UK No. 60.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candy_Flip#cite_note-British_Hit_Singles_&_Albums-4) Candy Flip split up in 1992.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candy_Flip#cite_note-Larkin90-3)

Peet became a [record producer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer "Record producer") and [engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_engineer "Audio engineer"), working with bands such as the [Charlatans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Charlatans_(English_band) "The Charlatans (English band)") and [Six by Seven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_by_Seven "Six by Seven").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candy_Flip#cite_note-Larkin90-3)

In the early 1990s, Spencer, together with his brother Kelvin Andrews, became the remix duo Sure Is Pure who provided remixes for other artists such as UK band [Space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(English_band) "Space (English band)") and [Eurythmics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurythmics "Eurythmics")' [Dave Stewart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Stewart_(Eurythmics) "Dave Stewart (Eurythmics)").[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candy_Flip#cite_note-8) The duo's remixes of the [Sister Sledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sister_Sledge "Sister Sledge") back catalogue, scored the 1970s disco group a couple of UK top 20 chart hits in 1993, including a number 5 position for an updated version of "We Are Family".[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candy_Flip#cite_note-9)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candy_Flip#cite_note-10)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candy_Flip#cite_note-11) Sure Is Pure also had a label called Pharm, which scored a UK number 8 hit in 1997 with [Blue Boy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Boy_(DJ) "Blue Boy (DJ)")'s "[Remember Me](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remember_Me_(Blue_Boy_song) "Remember Me (Blue Boy song)")" after it was licensed to [Jive Records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jive_Records "Jive Records").[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candy_Flip#cite_note-12)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candy_Flip#cite_note-13)

In the late 1990s, Spencer and Andrews went on to form Sound 5, releasing the album _No Illicit Dancing_ in 2000 on [Gut Records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gut_Records "Gut Records"), before the duo became Soul Mekanik. In 2006, the duo (as Soul Mekanik) produced four songs on the [Robbie Williams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robbie_Williams "Robbie Williams") album _[Rudebox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudebox\_(album) "Rudebox (album)")_ and, under the name Central Midfield, co-wrote ten of the tracks on Williams' 2009 album _[Reality Killed the Video Star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality\_Killed\_the\_Video\_Star "Reality Killed the Video Star")_.

By 2021, Andrews was presenting a radio show _Down to the Sea & Back_ on Brighton and Hove-based community radio station 1 BTN 101.4FM (1 Brighton FM).[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candy_Flip#cite_note-14)
