Instances of this are: The whole topological information of a smooth manifold M {\displaystyle M} is encoded in the algebraic properties of its R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } - algebra of smooth functions A = C ∞ ∞ ( M ) , {\displaystyle A=C^{\infty }(M),} as in the Banach–Stone theorem .

Vector bundles over M {\displaystyle M} correspond to projective finitely generated modules over A , {\displaystyle A,} via the functor Γ Γ {\displaystyle \Gamma } which associates to a vector bundle its module of sections.

Vector fields on M {\displaystyle M} are naturally identified with derivations of the algebra A {\displaystyle A} .

More generally, a linear differential operator of order k, sending sections of a vector bundle E → → M {\displaystyle E\rightarrow M} to sections of another bundle F → → M {\displaystyle F\rightarrow M} is seen to be an R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } -linear map Δ Δ : Γ Γ ( E ) → → Γ Γ ( F ) {\displaystyle \Delta :\Gamma (E)\to \Gamma (F)} between the associated modules, such that for any k + 1 {\displaystyle k+1} elements f 0 , … … , f k ∈ ∈ A {\displaystyle f_{0},\ldots ,f_{k}\in A} : [ f k [ f k − − 1 [ ⋯ ⋯ [ f 0 , Δ Δ ] ⋯ ⋯ ] ] ] = 0 {\displaystyle \left[f_{k}\left[f_{k-1}\left[\cdots \left[f_{0},\Delta \right]\cdots \right]\right]\right]=0} where the bracket [ f , Δ Δ ] : Γ Γ ( E ) → → Γ Γ ( F ) {\displaystyle [f,\Delta ]:\Gamma (E)\to \Gamma (F)} is defined as the commutator [ f , Δ Δ ] ( s ) = Δ Δ ( f ⋅ ⋅ s ) − − f ⋅ ⋅ Δ Δ ( s ) .

{\displaystyle [f,\Delta ](s)=\Delta (f\cdot s)-f\cdot \Delta (s).} Denoting the set of k {\displaystyle k} th order linear differential operators from an A {\displaystyle A} -module P {\displaystyle P} to an A {\displaystyle A} -module Q {\displaystyle Q} with D i f f k ( P , Q ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {Diff} _{k}(P,Q)} we obtain a bi-functor with values in the category of A {\displaystyle A} -modules. Other natural concepts of calculus such as jet spaces , differential forms are then obtained as representing objects of the functors D i f f k {\displaystyle \mathrm {Diff} _{k}} and related functors.

Seen from this point of view calculus may in fact be understood as the theory of these functors and their representing objects.

Replacing the real numbers R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } with any commutative ring , and the algebra C ∞ ∞ ( M ) {\displaystyle C^{\infty }(M)} with any commutative algebra the above said remains meaningful, hence differential calculus can be developed for arbitrary commutative algebras. Many of these concepts are widely used in algebraic geometry , differential geometry and secondary calculus . Moreover, the theory generalizes naturally to the setting of graded commutative algebra , allowing for a natural foundation of calculus on supermanifolds , graded manifolds and associated concepts like the Berezin integral .
