A member of the Democratic Party , he was the first African American president. Obama previously served as a U.S. senator representing Illinois from 2005 to 2008 and as an Illinois state senator from 1997 to 2004.

Born in Honolulu , Hawaii, Obama graduated from Columbia University in 1983 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science and later worked as a community organizer in Chicago . In 1988, Obama enrolled in Harvard Law School , where he was the first black president of the Harvard Law Review . He became a civil rights attorney and an academic, teaching constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School from 1992 to 2004. In 1996, Obama was elected to represent the 13th district in the Illinois Senate , a position he held until 2004, when he successfully ran for the U.S. Senate . In the 2008 presidential election , after a close primary campaign against Hillary Clinton , he was nominated by the Democratic Party for president. Obama selected Joe Biden as his running mate and defeated Republican nominee John McCain and his running mate Sarah Palin .

Obama was awarded the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize for efforts in international diplomacy, a decision which drew both criticism and praise. During his first term, his administration responded to the 2008 financial crisis with measures including the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 , a major stimulus package to guide the economy in recovering from the Great Recession ; a partial extension of the Bush tax cuts ; legislation to reform health care ; and the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act , a major financial regulation reform bill. Obama also appointed Supreme Court justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan , the former being the first Hispanic American on the Supreme Court. He oversaw the end of the Iraq War and ordered Operation Neptune Spear , the raid that killed Osama bin Laden , who was responsible for the September 11 attacks . Obama downplayed Bush's counterinsurgency model, expanding air strikes and making extensive use of special forces, while encouraging greater reliance on host-government militaries. He also ordered the 2011 military intervention in Libya to implement United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973 , contributing to the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi .

Obama defeated Republican opponent Mitt Romney and his running mate Paul Ryan in the 2012 presidential election . In his second term, Obama advocated for gun control in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting , took steps to combat climate change , signing the Paris Agreement , a major international climate agreement, and an executive order to limit carbon emissions . Obama also presided over the implementation of the Affordable Care Act and other legislation passed in his first term. He initiated sanctions against Russia following the invasion in Ukraine and again after Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections , ordered military intervention in Iraq in response to gains made by ISIL following the 2011 withdrawal from Iraq, negotiated the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (a nuclear agreement with Iran), and normalized relations with Cuba . The number of American soldiers in Afghanistan decreased during Obama's second term, though U.S. soldiers remained in the country throughout the remainder of his presidency. Obama promoted inclusion for LGBT Americans , becoming the first sitting U.S. president to publicly support same-sex marriage .

Obama left office in 2017 with high approval ratings both within the United States and among foreign advisories. He continues to reside in Washington, D.C., and remains politically active, campaigning for candidates in various American elections, including in Biden's successful presidential bid in the 2020 presidential election . Outside of politics, Obama has published three books : Dreams from My Father (1995) , The Audacity of Hope (2006), and A Promised Land (2020).

His presidential library began construction in the South Side of Chicago in 2021. Historians and political scientists rank Obama among the upper tier in historical rankings of U.S. presidents .

Early life and career Main article: Early life and career of Barack Obama Obama (right) with grandfather Stanley Armour Dunham , mother Ann Dunham , and half-sister Maya Soetoro , mid-1970s in Honolulu Barack Obama was born on August 4, 1961, [ 2 ] at Kapiolani Medical Center for Women and Children in Honolulu , Hawaii.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] He is the only president born outside the contiguous 48 states .

[ 7 ] He was born to an 18-year-old American mother and a 27-year-old Kenyan father. His mother, Ann Dunham (1942–1995), was born in Wichita, Kansas , and was of English, Welsh, German, Swiss, and Irish descent. In 2007 it was discovered her great-great-grandfather Falmouth Kearney emigrated from the village of Moneygall, Ireland to the U.S. in 1850.

[ 8 ] In July 2012, Ancestry.com found a strong likelihood that Dunham was descended from John Punch , an enslaved African man who lived in the Colony of Virginia during the seventeenth century.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] Obama has described the ancestors of his grandparents as Scotch-Irish mostly.

[ 12 ] Obama's father, Barack Obama Sr.

(1934–1982), [ 13 ] was a married [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] Luo Kenyan from Nyang'oma Kogelo .

[ 14 ] [ 17 ] His last name, Obama, was derived from his Luo descent.

[ 18 ] Obama's parents met in 1960 in a Russian language class at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa , where his father was a foreign student on a scholarship.

[ 19 ] [ 20 ] The couple married in Wailuku, Hawaii , on February 2, 1961, six months before Obama was born.

[ 21 ] [ 22 ] In late August 1961, a few weeks after he was born, Barack and his mother moved to the University of Washington in Seattle , where they lived for a year. During that time, Barack's father completed his undergraduate degree in economics in Hawaii, graduating in June 1962. He left to attend graduate school on a scholarship at Harvard University , where he earned a Master of Arts in economics. Obama's parents divorced in March 1964.

[ 23 ] Obama Sr. returned to Kenya in 1964, where he married for a third time and worked for the Kenyan government as the senior economic analyst in the Ministry of Finance.

[ 24 ] [ page needed ] He visited his son in Hawaii only once, at Christmas 1971, [ 25 ] before he was killed in an automobile accident in 1982, when Obama was 21 years old.

[ 26 ] Recalling his early childhood, Obama said: "That my father looked nothing like the people around me—that he was black as pitch, my mother white as milk—barely registered in my mind." [ 20 ] He described his struggles as a young adult to reconcile social perceptions of his multiracial heritage.

[ 27 ] In 1963, Dunham met Lolo Soetoro at the University of Hawaii ; he was an Indonesian East–West Center graduate student in geography . The couple married on Molokai on March 15, 1965.

[ 28 ] After two one-year extensions of his J-1 visa , Lolo returned to Indonesia in 1966. His wife and stepson followed sixteen months later in 1967. The family initially lived in the Menteng Dalam neighborhood in the Tebet district of South Jakarta . From 1970, they lived in a wealthier neighborhood in the Menteng district of Central Jakarta .

[ 29 ] Education Obama's Indonesian school record in St. Francis of Assisi Catholic Elementary School. Obama was enrolled as "Barry Soetoro" (no. 1), and was wrongly recorded as an Indonesian citizen (no. 3) and a Muslim (no. 4).

[ 30 ] At the age of 6, Obama and his mother had moved to Indonesia to join his stepfather. From age six to ten, he was registered in school as "Barry" [ 30 ] and attended local Indonesian-language schools: Sekolah Dasar Katolik Santo Fransiskus Asisi (St. Francis of Assisi Catholic Elementary School) for two years and Sekolah Dasar Negeri Menteng 01 (State Elementary School Menteng 01) for one and a half years, supplemented by English-language Calvert School homeschooling by his mother.

[ 31 ] [ 32 ] As a result of his four years in Jakarta , he was able to speak Indonesian fluently as a child.

[ 33 ] During his time in Indonesia, Obama's stepfather taught him to be resilient and gave him "a pretty hardheaded assessment of how the world works".

[ 34 ] In 1971, Obama returned to Honolulu to live with his maternal grandparents, Madelyn and Stanley Dunham . He attended Punahou School —a private college preparatory school —with the aid of a scholarship from fifth grade until he graduated from high school in 1979.

[ 35 ] In high school, Obama continued to use the nickname "Barry" which he kept until making a visit to Kenya in 1980.

[ 36 ] Obama lived with his mother and half-sister, Maya Soetoro , in Hawaii for three years from 1972 to 1975 while his mother was a graduate student in anthropology at the University of Hawaii.

[ 37 ] Obama chose to stay in Hawaii when his mother and half-sister returned to Indonesia in 1975, so his mother could begin anthropology field work.

[ 38 ] His mother spent most of the next two decades in Indonesia, divorcing Lolo Soetoro in 1980 and earning a PhD degree in 1992, before dying in 1995 in Hawaii following unsuccessful treatment for ovarian and uterine cancer .

[ 39 ] Of his years in Honolulu, Obama wrote: "The opportunity that Hawaii offered — to experience a variety of cultures in a climate of mutual respect — became an integral part of my world view, and a basis for the values that I hold most dear." [ 40 ] Obama has also written and talked about using alcohol , marijuana , and cocaine during his teenage years to "push questions of who I was out of my mind".

[ 41 ] Obama was also a member of the "Choom Gang" (the slang term for smoking marijuana), a self-named group of friends who spent time together and smoked marijuana.

[ 42 ] [ 43 ] College and research jobs After graduating from high school in 1979, Obama moved to Los Angeles to attend Occidental College on a full scholarship. In February 1981, Obama made his first public speech, calling for Occidental to participate in the disinvestment from South Africa in response to that nation's policy of apartheid .

[ 44 ] In mid-1981, Obama traveled to Indonesia to visit his mother and half-sister Maya and visited the families of college friends in Pakistan for three weeks.

[ 44 ] Later in 1981, he transferred to Columbia University in New York City as a junior , where he majored in political science with a specialty in international relations [ 45 ] and in English literature [ 46 ] and lived off-campus on West 109th Street.

[ 47 ] He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1983 and a 3.7 GPA . After graduating, Obama worked for about a year at the Business International Corporation , where he was a financial researcher and writer, [ 48 ] [ 49 ] then as a project coordinator for the New York Public Interest Research Group on the City College of New York campus for three months in 1985.

[ 50 ] [ 51 ] [ 52 ] Community organizer and Harvard Law School Two years after graduating from Columbia, Obama moved from New York to Chicago when he was hired as director of the Developing Communities Project , a faith-based community organization originally comprising eight Catholic parishes in Roseland , West Pullman , and Riverdale on Chicago's South Side . He worked there as a community organizer from June 1985 to May 1988.

[ 51 ] [ 53 ] He helped set up a job training program, a college preparatory tutoring program, and a tenants' rights organization in Altgeld Gardens .

[ 54 ] Obama also worked as a consultant and instructor for the Gamaliel Foundation , a community organizing institute.

[ 55 ] In mid-1988, he traveled for the first time in Europe for three weeks and then for five weeks in Kenya, where he met many of his paternal relatives for the first time.

[ 56 ] [ 57 ] External videos Derrick Bell threatens to leave Harvard , April 24, 1990, 11:34, Boston TV Digital Archive [ 58 ] Student Barack Obama introduces Professor Derrick Bell starting at 6:25.

Despite being offered a full scholarship to Northwestern University School of Law , Obama enrolled at Harvard Law School in the fall of 1988, living in nearby Somerville, Massachusetts .

[ 59 ] He was selected as an editor of the Harvard Law Review at the end of his first year, [ 60 ] president of the journal in his second year, [ 54 ] [ 61 ] and research assistant to the constitutional scholar Laurence Tribe while at Harvard.

[ 62 ] During his summers, he returned to Chicago, where he worked as a summer associate at the law firms of Sidley Austin in 1989 and Hopkins & Sutter in 1990.

[ 63 ] Obama's election as the first black president of the Harvard Law Review gained national media attention [ 54 ] [ 61 ] and led to a publishing contract and advance for a book about race relations, [ 64 ] which evolved into a personal memoir. The manuscript was published in mid-1995 as Dreams from My Father .

[ 64 ] Obama graduated from Harvard Law in 1991 with a Juris Doctor magna cum laude .

[ 65 ] [ 60 ] University of Chicago Law School In 1991, Obama accepted a two-year position as Visiting Law and Government Fellow at the University of Chicago Law School to work on his first book.

[ 64 ] [ 66 ] He then taught constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School for twelve years, first as a lecturer from 1992 to 1996, and then as a senior lecturer from 1996 to 2004.

[ 67 ] From April to October 1992, Obama directed Illinois's Project Vote , a voter registration campaign with ten staffers and seven hundred volunteer registrars; it achieved its goal of registering 150,000 of 400,000 unregistered African Americans in the state, leading Crain's Chicago Business to name Obama to its 1993 list of "40 under Forty" powers to be.

[ 68 ] Family and personal life Main article: Family of Barack Obama In a 2006 interview, Obama highlighted the diversity of his extended family : "It's like a little mini-United Nations," he said. "I've got relatives who look like Bernie Mac , and I've got relatives who look like Margaret Thatcher ." [ 69 ] Obama has a half-sister with whom he was raised (Maya Soetoro-Ng) and seven other half-siblings from his Kenyan father's family, six of them living.

[ 70 ] Obama's mother was survived by her Kansas-born mother, Madelyn Dunham, [ 71 ] until her death on November 2, 2008, [ 72 ] two days before his election to the presidency. Obama also has roots in Ireland; he met with his Irish cousins in Moneygall in May 2011.

[ 73 ] In Dreams from My Father , Obama ties his mother's family history to possible Native American ancestors and distant relatives of Jefferson Davis , President of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War . He also shares distant ancestors in common with George W. Bush and Dick Cheney , among others.

[ 74 ] [ 75 ] [ 76 ] Obama lived with anthropologist Sheila Miyoshi Jager while he was a community organizer in Chicago in the 1980s.

[ 77 ] He proposed to her twice, but both Jager and her parents turned him down.

[ 77 ] [ 78 ] The relationship was not made public until May 2017, several months after his presidency had ended.

[ 78 ] Obama poses in the Green Room of the White House with wife Michelle and daughters Sasha and Malia, September 2009 In June 1989, Obama met Michelle Robinson when he was employed at Sidley Austin .

[ 79 ] Robinson was assigned for three months as Obama's adviser at the firm, and she joined him at several group social functions but declined his initial requests to date.

[ 80 ] They began dating later that summer, became engaged in 1991, and were married on October 3, 1992.

[ 81 ] After suffering a miscarriage, Michelle underwent in vitro fertilization to conceive their children.

[ 82 ] The couple's first daughter, Malia Ann, was born in 1998, [ 83 ] followed by a second daughter, Natasha ("Sasha"), in 2001.

[ 84 ] The Obama daughters attended the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools . When they moved to Washington, D.C., in January 2009, the girls started at the Sidwell Friends School .

[ 85 ] The Obamas had two Portuguese Water Dogs ; the first, a male named Bo , was a gift from Senator Ted Kennedy .

[ 86 ] In 2013, Bo was joined by Sunny , a female.

[ 87 ] Bo died of cancer on May 8, 2021.

[ 88 ] Obama is a supporter of the Chicago White Sox , and he threw out the first pitch at the 2005 ALCS when he was still a senator.

[ 89 ] In 2009, he threw out the ceremonial first pitch at the All-Star Game while wearing a White Sox jacket.

[ 90 ] He is also primarily a Chicago Bears football fan in the NFL , but in his childhood and adolescence was a fan of the Pittsburgh Steelers and rooted for them ahead of their victory in Super Bowl XLIII 12 days after he took office as president.

[ 91 ] In 2011, Obama invited the 1985 Chicago Bears to the White House; the team had not visited the White House after their Super Bowl win in 1986 due to the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster .

[ 92 ] He plays basketball , a sport he participated in as a member of his high school's varsity team, [ 93 ] and he is left-handed.

[ 94 ] In 2005, the Obama family applied the proceeds of a book deal and moved from a Hyde Park, Chicago condominium to a $1.6 million house (equivalent to $2.6 million in 2024) in neighboring Kenwood, Chicago .

[ 95 ] The purchase of an adjacent lot—and sale of part of it to Obama by the wife of developer, campaign donor and friend Tony Rezko —attracted media attention because of Rezko's subsequent indictment and conviction on political corruption charges that were unrelated to Obama.

[ 96 ] In December 2007, Money Magazine estimated Obama's net worth at $1.3 million (equivalent to $2 million in 2024).

[ 97 ] Their 2009 tax return showed a household income of $5.5 million—up from about $4.2 million in 2007 and $1.6 million in 2005—mostly from sales of his books.

[ 98 ] [ 99 ] On his 2010 income of $1.7 million, he gave 14 percent to non-profit organizations, including $131,000 to Fisher House Foundation , a charity assisting wounded veterans' families, allowing them to reside near where the veteran is receiving medical treatments.

[ 100 ] [ 101 ] Per his 2012 financial disclosure, Obama may be worth as much as $10 million.

[ 102 ] Religious views Obama is a Protestant Christian whose religious views developed in his adult life.

[ 103 ] He wrote in The Audacity of Hope that he "was not raised in a religious household." He described his mother, raised by non-religious parents, as being detached from religion, yet "in many ways the most spiritually awakened person ... I have ever known", and "a lonely witness for secular humanism ." He described his father as a "confirmed atheist " by the time his parents met, and his stepfather as "a man who saw religion as not particularly useful." Obama explained how, through working with black churches as a community organizer while in his twenties, he came to understand "the power of the African-American religious tradition to spur social change." [ 104 ] The Obamas worship at African Methodist Episcopal Church in Washington, D.C., January 2013 In January 2008, Obama told Christianity Today : "I am a Christian, and I am a devout Christian. I believe in the redemptive death and resurrection of Jesus Christ . I believe that faith gives me a path to be cleansed of sin and have eternal life." [ 105 ] On September 27, 2010, Obama released a statement commenting on his religious views, saying: I'm a Christian by choice. My family didn't—frankly, they weren't folks who went to church every week. And my mother was one of the most spiritual people I knew, but she didn't raise me in the church. So I came to my Christian faith later in life, and it was because the precepts of Jesus Christ spoke to me in terms of the kind of life that I would want to lead—being my brothers' and sisters' keeper, treating others as they would treat me .

[ 106 ] [ 107 ] Obama met Trinity United Church of Christ pastor Jeremiah Wright in October 1987 and became a member of Trinity in 1992.

[ 108 ] During Obama's first presidential campaign in May 2008, he resigned from Trinity after some of Wright's statements were criticized .

[ 109 ] Since moving to Washington, D.C., in 2009, the Obama family has attended several Protestant churches, including Shiloh Baptist Church and St. John's Episcopal Church , as well as Evergreen Chapel at Camp David , but the members of the family do not attend church on a regular basis.

[ 110 ] [ 111 ] [ 112 ] In 2016, Obama said that he gets inspiration from a few items that remind him "of all the different people I've met along the way", adding: "I carry these around all the time. I'm not that superstitious, so it's not like I think I necessarily have to have them on me at all times." The items, "a whole bowl full", include rosary beads given to him by Pope Francis , a figurine of the Hindu deity Hanuman , a Coptic cross from Ethiopia, a small Buddha statue given by a monk, and a metal poker chip that used to be the lucky charm of a motorcyclist in Iowa.

[ 113 ] [ 114 ] Legal career From 1994 to 2002, Obama served on the boards of directors of the Woods Fund of Chicago —which in 1985 had been the first foundation to fund the Developing Communities Project—and of the Joyce Foundation .

[ 51 ] He served on the board of directors of the Chicago Annenberg Challenge from 1995 to 2002, as founding president and chairman of the board of directors from 1995 to 1999.

[ 51 ] Obama's law license became inactive in 2007.

[ 115 ] [ 116 ] Legislative career Illinois Senate (1997–2004) Main article: Illinois Senate career of Barack Obama State senator Obama and others celebrate the naming of a street in Chicago after ShoreBank co-founder Milton Davis in 1998 Obama was elected to the Illinois Senate in 1996, succeeding Democratic state senator Alice Palmer from Illinois's 13th District , which, at that time, spanned Chicago South Side neighborhoods from Hyde Park–Kenwood south to South Shore and west to Chicago Lawn .

[ 117 ] Once elected, Obama gained bipartisan support for legislation that reformed ethics and health care laws.

[ 118 ] [ 119 ] He sponsored a law that increased tax credits for low-income workers, negotiated welfare reform , and promoted increased subsidies for childcare.

[ 120 ] In 2001, as co-chairman of the bipartisan Joint Committee on Administrative Rules, Obama supported Republican governor George Ryan 's payday loan regulations and predatory mortgage lending regulations aimed at averting home foreclosures .

[ 205 ] Obama reduced the secrecy given to presidential records.

[ 206 ] He also revoked President George W. Bush's restoration of President Ronald Reagan 's Mexico City policy which prohibited federal aid to international family planning organizations that perform or provide counseling about abortion.

[ 219 ] Following the 2013 global surveillance disclosures by whistleblower Edward Snowden , Obama condemned the leak as unpatriotic, [ 220 ] but called for increased restrictions on the National Security Agency (NSA) to address violations of privacy.

[ 221 ] [ 222 ] Obama continued and expanded surveillance programs set up by George W. Bush, while implementing some reforms.

[ 223 ] He supported legislation that would have limited the NSA's ability to collect phone records in bulk under a single program and supported bringing more transparency to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC).

[ 223 ] Racial issues See also: Race and ethnicity in the United States In his speeches as president, Obama did not make more overt references to race relations than his predecessors, [ 224 ] [ 225 ] but according to one study, he implemented stronger policy action on behalf of African-Americans than any president since the Nixon era.

[ 226 ] Following Obama's election, many pondered the existence of a " post-racial America ".

[ 227 ] [ 228 ] However, lingering racial tensions quickly became apparent, [ 227 ] [ 229 ] and many African-Americans expressed outrage over what they saw as an intense racial animosity directed at Obama.

[ 230 ] The acquittal of George Zimmerman following the killing of Trayvon Martin sparked national outrage, leading to Obama giving a speech in which he said that "Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago." [ 231 ] The shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri , sparked a wave of protests .

[ 232 ] These and other events led to the birth of the Black Lives Matter movement, which campaigns against violence and systemic racism toward black people .

[ 232 ] Though Obama entered office reluctant to talk about race, by 2014 he began openly discussing the disadvantages faced by many members of minority groups.

[ 233 ] Several incidents during Obama's presidency generated disapproval from the African-American community and with law enforcement, and Obama sought to build trust between law enforcement officials and civil rights activists, with mixed results. Some in law enforcement criticized Obama's condemnation of racial bias after incidents in which police action led to the death of African-American men, while some racial justice activists criticized Obama's expressions of empathy for the police.

[ 234 ] In a March 2016 Gallup poll, nearly one third of Americans said they worried "a great deal" about race relations, a higher figure than in any previous Gallup poll since 2001.

[ 235 ] LGBT rights On October 8, 2009, Obama signed the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act , a measure that expanded the 1969 United States federal hate-crime law to include crimes motivated by a victim's actual or perceived gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability.

In 2016, the Pentagon ended the policy that barred transgender people from serving openly in the military .

[ 240 ] Same-sex marriage As a candidate for the Illinois state senate in 1996, Obama stated he favored legalizing same-sex marriage .

[ 241 ] During his Senate run in 2004, he said he supported civil unions and domestic partnerships for same-sex partners but opposed same-sex marriages.

[ 242 ] In 2008, he reaffirmed this position by stating "I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. I am not in favor of gay marriage." [ 243 ] On May 9, 2012, shortly after the official launch of his campaign for re-election as president, Obama said his views had evolved, and he publicly affirmed his personal support for the legalization of same-sex marriage, becoming the first sitting U.S. president to do so.

[ 244 ] [ 245 ] During his second inaugural address on January 21, 2013, [ 200 ] Obama became the first U.S. president in office to call for full equality for gay Americans, and the first to mention gay rights or the word "gay" in an inaugural address.

[ 246 ] [ 247 ] In 2013, the Obama administration filed briefs that urged the Supreme Court to rule in favor of same-sex couples in the cases of Hollingsworth v. Perry (regarding same-sex marriage) [ 248 ] and United States v. Windsor (regarding the Defense of Marriage Act ).

[ 249 ] Economic policy Main article: Economic policy of the Barack Obama administration On February 17, 2009, Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 , a $787 billion (equivalent to $1153 billion in 2024) economic stimulus package aimed at helping the economy recover from the deepening worldwide recession .

[ 250 ] The act includes increased federal spending for health care, infrastructure, education, various tax breaks and incentives , and direct assistance to individuals.

[ 251 ] In March 2009, Obama's Treasury Secretary, Timothy Geithner , took further steps to manage the 2008 financial crisis , including introducing the Public–Private Investment Program for Legacy Assets , which contains provisions for buying up to $2 trillion in depreciated real estate assets.

[ 252 ] Deficit and debt increases, 2001–2016 Obama intervened in the troubled automotive industry [ 253 ] in March 2009, renewing loans for General Motors (GM) and Chrysler to continue operations while reorganizing. Over the following months the White House set terms for both firms' bankruptcies, including the sale of Chrysler to Italian automaker Fiat [ 254 ] and a reorganization of GM giving the U.S. government a temporary 60 percent equity stake in the company.

[ 255 ] In June 2009, dissatisfied with the pace of economic stimulus, Obama called on his cabinet to accelerate the investment.

[ 256 ] He signed into law the Car Allowance Rebate System , known colloquially as "Cash for Clunkers", which temporarily boosted the economy.

[ 257 ] [ 258 ] [ 259 ] The Bush and Obama administrations authorized spending and loan guarantees from the Federal Reserve and the Department of the Treasury . These guarantees totaled about $11.5 trillion, but only $3 trillion had been spent by the end of November 2009.

[ 260 ] On August 2, 2011, after a lengthy congressional debate over whether to raise the nation's debt limit, Obama signed the bipartisan Budget Control Act of 2011 . The legislation enforced limits on discretionary spending until 2021, established a procedure to increase the debt limit, created a Congressional Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to propose further deficit reduction with a stated goal of achieving at least $1.5 trillion in budgetary savings over 10 years, and established automatic procedures for reducing spending by as much as $1.2 trillion if legislation originating with the new joint select committee did not achieve such savings.

[ 261 ] By passing the legislation, Congress was able to prevent a U.S. government default on its obligations.

[ 262 ] The unemployment rate rose in 2009, reaching a peak in October at 10.0 percent and averaging 10.0 percent in the fourth quarter. Following a decrease to 9.7 percent in the first quarter of 2010, the unemployment rate fell to 9.6 percent in the second quarter, where it remained for the rest of the year.

[ 263 ] Between February and December 2010, employment rose by 0.8 percent, which was less than the average of 1.9 percent experienced during comparable periods in the past four employment recoveries.

[ 264 ] By November 2012, the unemployment rate fell to 7.7 percent, [ 265 ] decreasing to 6.7 percent in the last month of 2013.

[ 266 ] During 2014, the unemployment rate continued to decline, falling to 6.3 percent in the first quarter.

[ 266 ] GDP growth returned in the third quarter of 2009, expanding at a rate of 1.6 percent, followed by a 5.0 percent increase in the fourth quarter.

[ 267 ] Growth continued in 2010, posting an increase of 3.7 percent in the first quarter, with lesser gains throughout the rest of the year.

[ 267 ] In July 2010, the Federal Reserve noted that economic activity continued to increase, but its pace had slowed, and chairman Ben Bernanke said the economic outlook was "unusually uncertain".

[ 268 ] Overall, the economy expanded at a rate of 2.9 percent in 2010.

[ 269 ] U.S.

unemployment rate and monthly changes in net employment during Obama's tenure as president [ 266 ] [ 270 ] Job growth during the presidency of Obama compared to other presidents, as measured as a cumulative percentage change from month after inauguration to end of his term The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and a broad range of economists credit Obama's stimulus plan for economic growth.

[ 271 ] [ 272 ] The CBO released a report stating that the stimulus bill increased employment by 1–2.1 million, [ 272 ] [ 273 ] [ 274 ] while conceding that "it is impossible to determine how many of the reported jobs would have existed in the absence of the stimulus package." [ 271 ] Although an April 2010, survey of members of the National Association for Business Economics showed an increase in job creation (over a similar January survey) for the first time in two years, 73 percent of 68 respondents believed the stimulus bill has had no impact on employment.

[ 275 ] The economy of the United States has grown faster than the other original NATO members by a wider margin under President Obama than it has anytime since the end of World War II .

[ 276 ] The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development credits the much faster growth in the United States to the stimulus plan of the U.S. and the austerity measures in the European Union.

[ 277 ] Within a month of the 2010 midterm elections , Obama announced a compromise deal with the Congressional Republican leadership that included a temporary, two-year extension of the 2001 and 2003 income tax rates , a one-year payroll tax reduction, continuation of unemployment benefits, and a new rate and exemption amount for estate taxes .

[ 278 ] The compromise overcame opposition from some in both parties, and the resulting $858 billion (equivalent to $1.2 trillion in 2024) Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 passed with bipartisan majorities in both houses of Congress before Obama signed it on December 17, 2010.

[ 279 ] In December 2013, Obama declared that growing income inequality is a "defining challenge of our time" and called on Congress to bolster the safety net and raise wages. This came on the heels of the nationwide strikes of fast-food workers and Pope Francis ' criticism of inequality and trickle-down economics .

[ 280 ] Obama urged Congress to ratify a 12-nation free trade pact called the Trans-Pacific Partnership .

[ 281 ] Environmental policy See also: Climate change policy of the United States and Energy policy of the Barack Obama administration Obama at a 2010 briefing on the BP oil spill at the Coast Guard Station Venice in Venice, Louisiana On April 20, 2010, an explosion destroyed an offshore drilling rig at the Macondo Prospect in the Gulf of Mexico , causing a major sustained oil leak . Obama visited the Gulf, announced a federal investigation, and formed a bipartisan commission to recommend new safety standards, after a review by Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar and concurrent Congressional hearings. He then announced a six-month moratorium on new deepwater drilling permits and leases, pending regulatory review.

[ 282 ] As multiple efforts by BP failed, some in the media and public expressed confusion and criticism over various aspects of the incident, and stated a desire for more involvement by Obama and the federal government.

[ 283 ] Prior to the oil spill, on March 31, 2010, Obama ended a ban on oil and gas drilling along the majority of the East Coast of the United States and along the coast of northern Alaska in an effort to win support for an energy and climate bill and to reduce foreign imports of oil and gas.

[ 284 ] In July 2013, Obama expressed reservations and said he "would reject the Keystone XL pipeline if it increased carbon pollution [or] greenhouse emissions." [ 285 ] [ 286 ] On February 24, 2015, Obama vetoed a bill that would have authorized the pipeline.

[ 287 ] It was the third veto of Obama's presidency and his first major veto.

[ 288 ] In December 2016, Obama permanently banned new offshore oil and gas drilling in most United States-owned waters in the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans using the 1953 Outer Continental Shelf Act.

[ 289 ] [ 290 ] [ 291 ] Obama emphasized the conservation of federal lands during his term in office. He used his power under the Antiquities Act to create 25 new national monuments during his presidency and expand four others, protecting a total of 553,000,000 acres (224,000,000 ha) of federal lands and waters, more than any other U.S. president.

[ 292 ] [ 293 ] [ 294 ] Health care reform Main article: Healthcare reform in the United States Obama called for Congress to pass legislation reforming health care in the United States , a key campaign promise and a top legislative goal.

[ 295 ] He proposed an expansion of health insurance coverage to cover the uninsured, cap premium increases, and allow people to retain their coverage when they leave or change jobs. His proposal was to spend $900 billion over ten years and include a government insurance plan, also known as the public option , to compete with the corporate insurance sector as a main component to lowering costs and improving quality of health care. It would also make it illegal for insurers to drop sick people or deny them coverage for pre-existing conditions , and require every American to carry health coverage. The plan also includes medical spending cuts and taxes on insurance companies that offer expensive plans.

[ 296 ] [ 297 ] Maximum Out-of-Pocket Premium as Percentage of Family Income and federal poverty level , under Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act , starting in 2014 (source: CRS ) [ 298 ] On July 14, 2009, House Democratic leaders introduced a 1,017-page plan for overhauling the U.S. health care system, which Obama wanted Congress to approve by the end of 2009.

[ 295 ] After public debate during the Congressional summer recess of 2009, Obama delivered a speech to a joint session of Congress on September 9 where he addressed concerns over the proposals.

[ 299 ] In March 2009, Obama lifted a ban on using federal funds for stem cell research.

[ 300 ] On November 7, 2009, a health care bill featuring the public option was passed in the House.

[ 301 ] [ 302 ] On December 24, 2009, the Senate passed its own bill—without a public option—on a party-line vote of 60–39.

[ 303 ] On March 21, 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA, colloquially "Obamacare") passed by the Senate in December was passed in the House by a vote of 219 to 212. Obama signed the bill into law on March 23, 2010.

[ 304 ] The ACA includes health-related provisions , most of which took effect in 2014, including expanding Medicaid eligibility for people making up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL) starting in 2014, [ 305 ] subsidizing insurance premiums for people making up to 400 percent of the FPL ($88,000 for family of four in 2010) so their maximum "out-of-pocket" payment for annual premiums will be from 2 percent to 9.5 percent of income, [ 306 ] providing incentives for businesses to provide health care benefits, prohibiting denial of coverage and denial of claims based on pre-existing conditions, establishing health insurance exchanges , prohibiting annual coverage caps, and support for medical research. According to White House and CBO figures, the maximum share of income that enrollees would have to pay would vary depending on their income relative to the federal poverty level.

[ 307 ] Percentage of Individuals in the United States without Health Insurance, 1963–2015 (source: JAMA ) [ 308 ] The costs of these provisions are offset by taxes, fees, and cost-saving measures, such as new Medicare taxes for those in high-income brackets , taxes on indoor tanning , cuts to the Medicare Advantage program in favor of traditional Medicare, and fees on medical devices and pharmaceutical companies; [ 309 ] there is also a tax penalty for those who do not obtain health insurance, unless they are exempt due to low income or other reasons.

[ 310 ] In March 2010, the CBO estimated that the net effect of both laws will be a reduction in the federal deficit by $143 billion over the first decade.

[ 311 ] The law faced several legal challenges, primarily based on the argument that an individual mandate requiring Americans to buy health insurance was unconstitutional. On June 28, 2012, the Supreme Court ruled by a 5–4 vote in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius that the mandate was constitutional under the U.S. Congress's taxing authority.

[ 312 ] In Burwell v. Hobby Lobby the Court ruled that "closely-held" for-profit corporations could be exempt on religious grounds under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act from regulations adopted under the ACA that would have required them to pay for insurance that covered certain contraceptives. In June 2015, the Court ruled 6–3 in King v. Burwell that subsidies to help individuals and families purchase health insurance were authorized for those doing so on both the federal exchange and state exchanges, not only those purchasing plans "established by the State", as the statute reads.

Starting with information received from Central Intelligence Agency operatives in July 2010, the CIA developed intelligence over the next several months that determined what they believed to be the hideout of Osama bin Laden . He was living in seclusion in a large compound in Abbottabad , Pakistan, a suburban area 35 miles (56 km) from Islamabad .

[ 349 ] CIA head Leon Panetta reported this intelligence to President Obama in March 2011.

Legacy and recognition Obama has been described as one of the most effective campaigners in American history (his 2008 campaign being particularly highlighted) as well as one of the most talented political orators of the 21st century.

[ 501 ] [ 502 ] [ 503 ] Historian Julian Zelizer credits Obama with "a keen sense of how the institutions of government work and the ways that his team could design policy proposals." Zeitzer notes Obama's policy successes included the economic stimulus package which ended the Great Recession and the Dodd-Frank financial and consumer protection reforms, as well as the Affordable Care Act . Zeitzer also notes the Democratic Party lost power and numbers of elected officials during Obama's term, saying that the consensus among historians is that Obama "turned out to be a very effective policymaker but not a tremendously successful party builder." Zeitzer calls this the "defining paradox of Obama's presidency".

[ 504 ] The Brookings Institution noted that Obama passed "only one major legislative achievement (Obamacare)—and a fragile one at that—the legacy of Obama's presidency mainly rests on its tremendous symbolic importance and the fate of a patchwork of executive actions." [ 505 ] David W. Wise noted that Obama fell short "in areas many Progressives hold dear", including the continuation of drone strikes, not going after big banks during the Great Recession, and failing to strengthen his coalition before pushing for Obamacare. Wise called Obama's legacy that of "a disappointingly conventional president".

[ 506 ] Obama's most significant accomplishment is generally considered to be the Affordable Care Act (ACA), provisions of which went into effect from 2010 to 2020. Many attempts by Senate Republicans to repeal the ACA, including a "skinny repeal", have thus far failed.

[ 507 ] However, in 2017, the penalty for violating the individual mandate was repealed effective 2019.

[ 508 ] Together with the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act amendment, it represents the U.S. healthcare system's most significant regulatory overhaul and expansion of coverage since the passage of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965.

[ 509 ] [ 510 ] [ 511 ] [ 512 ] Many commentators credit Obama with averting a threatened depression and pulling the economy back from the Great Recession.

[ 507 ] According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics , the Obama administration created 11.3 million jobs from the month after his first inauguration to the end of his second term.

[ 513 ] In 2010, Obama signed into effect the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Passed as a response to the 2008 financial crisis , it brought the most significant changes to financial regulation in the United States since the regulatory reform that followed the Great Depression under Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt.

[ 514 ] In 2009, Obama signed into law the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 , which contained in it the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, the first addition to existing federal hate crime law in the United States since Democratic President Bill Clinton signed into law the Church Arson Prevention Act of 1996. The act expanded existing federal hate crime laws in the United States , and made it a federal crime to assault people based on sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability.

[ 515 ] As president, Obama advanced LGBT rights.

[ 516 ] In 2010, he signed the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act , which brought an end to "don't ask, don't tell" policy in the U.S. armed forces that banned open service from LGBT people; the law went into effect the following year.

[ 517 ] In 2016, his administration brought an end to the ban on transgender people serving openly in the U.S. armed forces.

[ 518 ] [ 240 ] A Gallup poll , taken in the final days of Obama's term, showed that 68 percent of Americans believed the U.S. had made progress on LGBT rights during Obama's eight years in office.

[ 519 ] Obama substantially escalated the use of drone strikes against suspected militants and terrorists associated with al-Qaeda and the Taliban .

[ 520 ] In 2016, the last year of his presidency, the U.S. dropped 26,171 bombs on seven different countries.

[ 521 ] [ 522 ] Obama left about 8,400 U.S. troops in Afghanistan , 5,262 in Iraq, 503 in Syria, 133 in Pakistan, 106 in Somalia, seven in Yemen, and two in Libya at the end of his presidency.

[ 523 ] According to Pew Research Center and United States Bureau of Justice Statistics , from December 31, 2009, to December 31, 2015, inmates sentenced in U.S. federal custody declined by five percent. This is the largest decline in sentenced inmates in U.S. federal custody of any president since Jimmy Carter . By contrast, the federal prison population increased significantly under presidents Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush.

[ 524 ] Human Rights Watch (HRW) called Obama's human rights record "mixed", adding that "he has often treated human rights as a secondary interest—nice to support when the cost was not too high, but nothing like a top priority he championed." [ 223 ] Obama left office in January 2017 with a 60 percent approval rating.

[ 525 ] [ 526 ] He gained 10 spots from the same survey in 2015 from the Brookings Institution that ranked him the 18th-greatest American president.

[ 527 ] In Gallup's 2018 job approval poll for the past 10 U.S. presidents, he received a 63 percent approval rating.

[ 486 ] Presidential library Main article: Barack Obama Presidential Center The Barack Obama Presidential Center is Obama's planned presidential library . It will be hosted by the University of Chicago and located in Jackson Park on the South Side of Chicago.

[ 528 ] Awards and honors Main article: List of awards and honors received by Barack Obama Obama received the Norwegian Nobel Committee 's Nobel Peace Prize in 2009, The Shoah Foundation Institute for Visual History and Education's Ambassador of Humanity Award in 2014, the John F.
