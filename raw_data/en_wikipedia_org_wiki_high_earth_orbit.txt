For a more common disambiguation of HEO, see Highly elliptical orbit .

Geocentric orbit with an altitude entirely above that of a geosynchronous orbit Space of high Earth orbits (HEO), between medium Earth orbits (MEO) and the orbit of the Moon .

A high Earth orbit is a geocentric orbit with an apogee farther than that of the geosynchronous orbit , which is 35,786 km (22,236 mi) away from Earth .

[ 1 ] In this article, the non-standard abbreviation of HEO is used for high Earth orbit.

[ 2 ] The development of HEO technology has had a significant impact on space exploration and has paved the way for future missions to deep space . The ability to place satellites in HEO has allowed scientists to make groundbreaking discoveries in astronomy and Earth science , while also enabling global communication and navigation systems .

[ 3 ] The Moon's Hill sphere is entered at a distance to the Moon of 60,000 km (37,000 mi), [ 4 ] lunar orbits until a distance of 690 km (430 mi) are unstable due to Earth's gravitational reach.

[ 5 ] Near-rectilinear halo orbits around the Moon are within these distances to the Moon, occupying cislunar space .
Earth's hill sphere extends to a distance of 1,471,400 km (914,300 mi), encompassing halo orbits , orbits around the Sun-Earth Lagrange points , with orbits increasingly being heliocentric , co-orbiting with Earth the Sun before orbits go deeper into interplanetary space .

Orbit Name GEO Geostationary orbit GSO Geosynchronous orbit GTO Geostationary transfer orbit HEO Highly elliptical orbit NRHO Near-rectilinear halo orbit Satellites in High Earth orbits are primarily used for communication , navigation , scientific research , and military applications .

[ 6 ] One of the main benefits of HEO is that it provides a nearly unobstructed view of the Earth and deep space. This makes it an ideal location for astronomical observations and Earth monitoring. In addition, satellites in HEO can provide a continuous coverage of the Earth's surface, making it very useful for communication and navigation purposes.

[ 7 ] A variety of satellites, such as TESS , [ 8 ] have been placed in HEO.

There are four main reasons that most satellite are placed in lower orbits. First, a HEO can take a month or more per orbit. This is because HEOs are very large orbits and move at only 3000 m/s (11,000 km/h, 7000 mph). Meanwhile, a LEO (low Earth orbit) can take less than 90 minutes.

[ 9 ] So, for satellites that need to orbit quickly, HEO is not a good fit. Second, HEOs take far more energy to place a satellite into than LEOs. To place a satellite into HEO takes nearly as much energy as to place it into a heliocentric orbit . For example, an expended Falcon 9 can carry 22,500 kg (50,000 lbs) to LEO. However, it can only carry around 4500 kg (10,000 lbs) to HEO.

[ 10 ] This means that it costs 5 times more to place a payload in HEO versus placing it in LEO. Third, HEOs are extremely far from Earth. This means that there is a constant communication delay when sending signals to and from the satellite. This is actually because the signals can only travel at the speed of light . This means that it can take around 0.1 to 4.5 seconds in delay time each way. This makes it useless for internet , and hard to use for other things as well. The fourth reason is radiation . HEO is outside of the magnetic field of Earth . This means that there is far more radiation in HEO. As a result, spacecraft in HEO require specialized equipment and shielding to protect them from radiation. As a result, only satellites that require the unique characteristics of HEO use this orbit.

A special case of a high Earth orbit is the highly elliptical orbit where altitude at perigee may reach as low as 2,000 km (1,200 mi).
