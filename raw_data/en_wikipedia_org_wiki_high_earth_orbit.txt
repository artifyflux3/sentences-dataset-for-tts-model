This article is about a type of geocentric orbit defined by altitude. For a more common disambiguation of HEO, see [Highly elliptical orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highly_elliptical_orbit "Highly elliptical orbit").

Space of high Earth orbits (HEO), between [medium Earth orbits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium_Earth_orbit "Medium Earth orbit") (MEO) and the [orbit of the Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_of_the_Moon "Orbit of the Moon").

A **high Earth orbit** is a [geocentric orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentric_orbit "Geocentric orbit") with an [apogee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsis "Apsis") farther than that of the [geosynchronous orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geosynchronous_orbit "Geosynchronous orbit"), which is 35,786 km (22,236 mi) [away from Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Height_above_mean_sea_level "Height above mean sea level").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Earth_orbit#cite_note-1) In this article, the non-standard abbreviation of _HEO_ is used for high Earth orbit.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Earth_orbit#cite_note-2)

The development of HEO technology has had a significant impact on [space exploration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_exploration "Space exploration") and has paved the way for [future missions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_of_space_exploration "Future of space exploration") to [deep space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_space_exploration "Deep space exploration"). The ability to place satellites in HEO has allowed scientists to make groundbreaking discoveries in [astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy "Astronomy") and [Earth science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_science "Earth science"), while also enabling [global communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_communication "International communication") and [navigation systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation_system "Navigation system").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Earth_orbit#cite_note-3)

The Moon's [Hill sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_sphere "Hill sphere") is entered at a distance to the Moon of 60,000 km (37,000 mi),[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Earth_orbit#cite_note-4)[lunar orbits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_orbit "Lunar orbit") until a distance of 690 km (430 mi) are unstable due to Earth's gravitational reach.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Earth_orbit#cite_note-Phys.org_2006_k599-5)[Near-rectilinear halo orbits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-rectilinear_halo_orbit "Near-rectilinear halo orbit") around the Moon are within these distances to the Moon, occupying [cislunar space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cislunar_space "Cislunar space"). Earth's hill sphere extends to a distance of 1,471,400 km (914,300 mi), encompassing [halo orbits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_orbit "Halo orbit"), [orbits around the Sun-Earth Lagrange points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_objects_at_Lagrange_points "List of objects at Lagrange points"), with orbits increasingly [being heliocentric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentric_orbit "Heliocentric orbit"), [co-orbiting with Earth the Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-orbiting "Co-orbiting") before orbits go deeper into [interplanetary space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interplanetary_space "Interplanetary space").

Satellites in High Earth orbits are primarily used for [communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication "Communication"), [navigation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation "Navigation"), [scientific research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method "Scientific method"), and [military applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_applications "Military applications").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Earth_orbit#cite_note-6) One of the main benefits of HEO is that it provides a nearly unobstructed view of the Earth and deep space. This makes it an ideal location for astronomical observations and Earth monitoring. In addition, satellites in HEO can provide a continuous coverage of the Earth's surface, making it very useful for communication and navigation purposes.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Earth_orbit#cite_note-7) A variety of satellites, such as [TESS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TESS "TESS"),[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Earth_orbit#cite_note-:0-8) have been placed in HEO.

There are four main reasons that most satellite are placed in lower orbits. First, a HEO can take a month or more per orbit. This is because HEOs are very large orbits and move at only 3000 m/s (11,000 km/h, 7000 mph). Meanwhile, a [LEO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit "Low Earth orbit") (low Earth orbit) can take less than 90 minutes.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Earth_orbit#cite_note-9) So, for satellites that need to orbit quickly, HEO is not a good fit. Second, HEOs take far more energy to place a satellite into than LEOs. To place a satellite into HEO takes nearly as much energy as to place it into a [heliocentric orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentric_orbit "Heliocentric orbit"). For example, an [expended](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expendable_launch_system "Expendable launch system")[Falcon 9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_9 "Falcon 9") can carry 22,500 kg (50,000 lbs) to LEO. However, it can only carry around 4500 kg (10,000 lbs) to HEO. [[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Earth_orbit#cite_note-10) This means that it costs 5 times more to place a [payload](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payload "Payload") in HEO versus placing it in LEO. Third, HEOs are extremely far from Earth. This means that there is a constant [communication delay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_satellite "Communications satellite") when [sending signals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transmission "Signal transmission") to and from the satellite. This is actually because the signals can only travel at the [speed of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light "Speed of light"). This means that it can take around 0.1 to 4.5 seconds in delay time each way. This makes it [useless for internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_Internet_access "Satellite Internet access"), and hard to use for other things as well. The fourth reason is [radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_radiation "Space radiation"). HEO is outside of the [magnetic field of Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_magnetic_field "Earth's magnetic field"). This means that there is far more radiation in HEO. As a result, [spacecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft "Spacecraft") in HEO require specialized equipment and [shielding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_shield "Radiation shield") to protect them from radiation. As a result, only satellites that require the unique characteristics of HEO use this orbit.

A special case of a high Earth orbit is the [highly elliptical orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highly_elliptical_orbit "Highly elliptical orbit") where altitude at perigee may reach as low as 2,000 km (1,200 mi).
