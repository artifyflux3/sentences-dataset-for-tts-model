They are a three-time Grammy Award –nominated troupe who express their history as black women through song, dance, and sign language .

[ 1 ] Originally a four-person ensemble, the group has expanded to five-part harmonies, with a sixth member acting as a sign-language interpreter. Although the members have changed over five decades, the group continues to sing and perform worldwide.

Musical career [ edit ] Sweet Honey in the Rock was founded in 1973 by Bernice Johnson Reagon , who was teaching a vocal workshop with the Washington, D.C.

Black Repertory Company. It was going to be group of 10 to 13 people, (women and men) but because of life getting in the way for a lot of people, the group officially started with only 4 women, who were Bernice Johnson Reagon , Louise Robinson, Carol Lynn Maillard , and Mie Fredericks. And after singing 5 songs together they said "This is it!" [ 1 ] In December 2002 Bernice Johnson Reagon announces to all the members of sweet honey, that she will be retired from the group after the 30th anniversary year (2003), and she told the order members that if they wanted to continued without her she will support and accept that, but if not then 2003 would be Sweet Honey in the Rock's final year. the other members of sweet honey decided to continue singing and performing shows without her, and they did 3 days of auditioning with 10 different women, who either was a substitute/former singer or someone that the members knew personally, after 3 days they decided to pick 2 singers to rejoin Sweet Honey in the Rock. Louise Robinson (who is the 2nd member of sweet honey and one of the original member of the group, who stayed from 1973 to 1976,) and Arnae Batson (Who is the 22nd sweet honey singer, who had been a substitute singer seen 1994.) By 2004 Bernice Johnson Reagon started to leave the group and come back to perform with sweet honey sometimes between 2004 and 2006, before completely retiring in 2006.

[ 2 ] The name of the group was derived from a song, based on Psalm 81:16 , which tells of a land so rich that when rocks were cracked open, honey flowed from them.

[ 3 ] Johnson has said that this first song in which four women blended their voices was so powerful, that there was no question what the name of the group should be. The ensemble's most powerful messages are proclaimed through an enormous catalog of songs addressing the world's woes. They are currently occupied with immigration injustices, congressional greed and lack of compassion for citizens, the environmental imbalance, racial issues and women's issues.

[ 4 ] Sweet Honey in the Rock has received several Grammy Award nominations , including one for their children's album, “Still The Same Me” which received the Silver Award from the National Association of Parenting Publications. They contributed their version of Lead Belly 's "Grey Goose" from the compilation album Folkways: A Vision Shared which won the Grammy Award for Best Traditional Folk Album .

[ 5 ] Performing at the White House on Feb 18, 2009 Their vocals appeared in a number of animated counting cartoons on the PBS series Sesame Street , and the group was the subject of the 2005 documentary Sweet Honey in the Rock: Raise Your Voice .

The group has ventured through 25 vocalists since its creation. Embarking on a new chapter in their musical journey, Sweet Honey In The Rock now includes four core vocalists—Louise Robinson, Carol Lynn Maillard , (both founding members), Nitanju Bolade Casel , and Aisha Kahlil .

Shirley Childress Johnson Saxton , an American Sign Language Interpreter, performed live with the group from 1980 until she died in 2017.

[ 4 ] Influences [ edit ] Sweet Honey in the Rock has been making music since the mid-1970s. Although the members of the group have changed over time, their music has consistently combined contemporary rhythms and narratives with a musical style rooted in the Gospel music , spirituals and hymns of the African-American Church. The ensemble composes much of their own music. They have addressed topics including motherhood, spirituality , freedom , civil rights , domestic violence , immigration issues, and racism .

[ 6 ] In their latest album, "#LoveinEvolution," they address the additional topics of police shootings, specifically the Charleston church shooting , and the environment.

[ 7 ] Members [ edit ] Sweet Honey In The Rock's 10th anniversary concert on Nov 18, 1983 with a reunion of 15 out of 19 singers at Gallaudet College Auditorium.

Over the decades, more than 20 individuals have lent their voices to Sweet Honey in the Rock. Beginning as a quartet , the group is now composed of six African-American women (including a professional American Sign Language interpreter who accompanies the group on concert tours).
