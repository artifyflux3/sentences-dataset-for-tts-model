For quotients of topological spaces, see Quotient space (topology) .

In linear algebra , the quotient of a vector space V {\displaystyle V} by a subspace U {\displaystyle U} is a vector space obtained by "collapsing" U {\displaystyle U} to zero. The space obtained is called a quotient space and is denoted V / U {\displaystyle V/U} (read " V {\displaystyle V} mod U {\displaystyle U} " or " V {\displaystyle V} by U {\displaystyle U} ").

Definition [ edit ] Formally, the construction is as follows.

[ 1 ] Let V {\displaystyle V} be a vector space over a field K {\displaystyle \mathbb {K} } , and let U {\displaystyle U} be a subspace of V {\displaystyle V} . We define an equivalence relation ∼ ∼ {\displaystyle \sim } on V {\displaystyle V} by stating that x ∼ ∼ y {\displaystyle x\sim y} iff x − − y ∈ ∈ U {\displaystyle x-y\in U} . That is, x {\displaystyle x} is related to y {\displaystyle y} if and only if one can be obtained from the other by adding an element of U {\displaystyle U} . This definition implies that any element of U {\displaystyle U} is related to the zero vector; more precisely, all the vectors in U {\displaystyle U} get mapped into the equivalence class of the zero vector.

The equivalence class – or, in this case, the coset – of x {\displaystyle x} is defined as [ v ] := { v + u : u ∈ ∈ U } {\displaystyle [v]:=\{v+u:u\in U\}} and is often denoted using the shorthand [ v ] = v + U {\displaystyle [v]=v+U} .

The quotient space V / U {\displaystyle V/U} is then defined as V / ∼ ∼ {\displaystyle V/_{\sim }} , the set of all equivalence classes induced by ∼ ∼ {\displaystyle \sim } on U {\displaystyle U} . Scalar multiplication and addition are defined on the equivalence classes by [ 2 ] [ 3 ] α α [ x ] = [ α α x ] {\displaystyle \alpha [x]=[\alpha x]} for all α α ∈ ∈ K {\displaystyle \alpha \in \mathbb {K} } , and [ x ] + [ y ] = [ x + y ] {\displaystyle [x]+[y]=[x+y]} .

It is not hard to check that these operations are well-defined (i.e. do not depend on the choice of representatives ). These operations turn the quotient space V / U {\displaystyle V/U} into a vector space over K {\displaystyle \mathbb {K} } with U {\displaystyle U} being the zero class, [ 0 ] {\displaystyle [0]} .

The mapping that associates to v ∈ ∈ V {\displaystyle v\in V} the equivalence class [ v ] {\displaystyle [v]} is known as the quotient map .

Alternatively phrased, the quotient space V / U {\displaystyle V/U} is the set of all affine subsets of V {\displaystyle V} which are parallel to U {\displaystyle U} [ 4 ] Examples [ edit ] Lines in Cartesian Plane [ edit ] Let X = R 2 be the standard Cartesian plane , and let Y be a line through the origin in X .  Then the quotient space X / Y can be identified with the space of all lines in X which are parallel to Y .  That is to say that, the elements of the set X / Y are lines in X parallel to Y .  Note that the points along any one such line will satisfy the equivalence relation because their difference vectors belong to Y . This gives a way to visualize quotient spaces geometrically. (By re-parameterising these lines, the quotient space can more conventionally be represented as the space of all points along a line through the origin that is not parallel to Y . Similarly, the quotient space for R 3 by a line through the origin can again be represented as the set of all co-parallel lines, or alternatively be represented as the vector space consisting of a plane which only intersects the line at the origin.) Subspaces of Cartesian Space [ edit ] Another example is the quotient of R n by the subspace spanned by the first m standard basis vectors .  The space R n consists of all n -tuples of real numbers ( x 1 , ..., x n ) .  The subspace, identified with R m , consists of all n -tuples such that the last n − m entries are zero: ( x 1 , ..., x m , 0, 0, ..., 0) .  Two vectors of R n are in the same equivalence class modulo the subspace if and only if they are identical in the last n − m coordinates. The quotient space R n / R m is isomorphic to R n − m in an obvious manner.

Polynomial Vector Space [ edit ] Let P 3 ( R ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {P}}_{3}(\mathbb {R} )} be the vector space of all cubic polynomials over the real numbers. Then P 3 ( R ) / ⟨ ⟨ x 2 ⟩ ⟩ {\displaystyle {\mathcal {P}}_{3}(\mathbb {R} )/\langle x^{2}\rangle } is a quotient space, where each element is the set corresponding to polynomials that differ by a quadratic term only. For example, one element of the quotient space is { x 3 + a x 2 − − 2 x + 3 : a ∈ ∈ R } {\displaystyle \{x^{3}+ax^{2}-2x+3:a\in \mathbb {R} \}} , while another element of the quotient space is { a x 2 + 2.7 x : a ∈ ∈ R } {\displaystyle \{ax^{2}+2.7x:a\in \mathbb {R} \}} .

General Subspaces [ edit ] More generally, if V is an (internal) direct sum of subspaces U and W, V = U ⊕ ⊕ W {\displaystyle V=U\oplus W} then the quotient space V / U is naturally isomorphic to W .

[ 5 ] Lebesgue Integrals [ edit ] An important example of a functional quotient space is an L p space .

Properties [ edit ] There is a natural epimorphism from V to the quotient space V / U given by sending x to its equivalence class [ x ]. The kernel (or nullspace) of this epimorphism is the subspace U . This relationship is neatly summarized by the short exact sequence 0 → → U → → V → → V / U → → 0.

{\displaystyle 0\to U\to V\to V/U\to 0.\,} If U is a subspace of V , the dimension of V / U is called the codimension of U in V . Since a basis of V may be constructed from a basis A of U and a basis B of V / U by adding a representative of each element of B to A , the dimension of V is the sum of the dimensions of U and V / U . If V is finite-dimensional , it follows that the codimension of U in V is the difference between the dimensions of V and U : [ 6 ] [ 7 ] c o d i m ( U ) = dim ⁡ ⁡ ( V / U ) = dim ⁡ ⁡ ( V ) − − dim ⁡ ⁡ ( U ) .

{\displaystyle \mathrm {codim} (U)=\dim(V/U)=\dim(V)-\dim(U).} Let T : V → W be a linear operator . The kernel of T , denoted ker( T ), is the set of all x in V such that Tx = 0. The kernel is a subspace of V . The first isomorphism theorem for vector spaces says that the quotient space V /ker( T ) is isomorphic to the image of V in W . An immediate corollary , for finite-dimensional spaces, is the rank–nullity theorem : the dimension of V is equal to the dimension of the kernel (the nullity of T ) plus the dimension of the image (the rank of T ).

The cokernel of a linear operator T : V → W is defined to be the quotient space W /im( T ).

Isomorphism Theorems [ edit ] First Isomorphism Theorem [ edit ] Let V,W be K-Vector Spaces and T:V->W linear. Define the map T ¯ ¯ : V / ker ⁡ ⁡ T → → im ⁡ ⁡ ( T ) {\displaystyle {\overline {T}}:V/\ker T\to \operatorname {im} (T)} by T ¯ ¯ ( [ v ] ) = T ( v ) .

{\displaystyle {\overline {T}}([v])=T(v).} Then T ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle {\overline {T}}} is well-defined and an isomorphism.

Quotient of a Banach space by a subspace [ edit ] If X is a Banach space and M is a closed subspace of X , then the quotient X / M is again a Banach space. The quotient space is already endowed with a vector space structure by the construction of the previous section. We define a norm on X / M by ‖ ‖ [ x ] ‖ ‖ X / M = inf m ∈ ∈ M ‖ ‖ x − − m ‖ ‖ X = inf m ∈ ∈ M ‖ ‖ x + m ‖ ‖ X = inf y ∈ ∈ [ x ] ‖ ‖ y ‖ ‖ X .

{\displaystyle \|[x]\|_{X/M}=\inf _{m\in M}\|x-m\|_{X}=\inf _{m\in M}\|x+m\|_{X}=\inf _{y\in [x]}\|y\|_{X}.} Examples [ edit ] Let C [0,1] denote the Banach space of continuous real-valued functions on the interval [0,1] with the sup norm . Denote the subspace of all functions f ∈ C [0,1] with f (0) = 0 by M . Then the equivalence class of some function g is determined by its value at 0, and the quotient space C [0,1]/ M is isomorphic to R .

If X is a Hilbert space , then the quotient space X / M is isomorphic to the orthogonal complement of M .

Generalization to locally convex spaces [ edit ] The quotient of a locally convex space by a closed subspace is again locally convex.

[ 8 ] Indeed, suppose that X is locally convex so that the topology on X is generated by a family of seminorms { p α | α ∈ A } where A is an index set.  Let M be a closed subspace, and define seminorms q α on X / M by q α α ( [ x ] ) = inf v ∈ ∈ [ x ] p α α ( v ) .

{\displaystyle q_{\alpha }([x])=\inf _{v\in [x]}p_{\alpha }(v).} Then X / M is a locally convex space, and the topology on it is the quotient topology .

If, furthermore, X is metrizable , then so is X / M .  If X is a Fréchet space , then so is X / M .
