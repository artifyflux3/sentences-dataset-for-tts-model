[ 5 ] The population was 49,328 at the 2020 census .

[ 6 ] The Dublin Irish Festival advertises itself as the largest three-day Irish festival in the world.

History [ edit ] Aerial view of Dublin in May 1929 Native Americans [ edit ] Native Americans from the Hopewell , Adena , Delaware , Shawnee , and Wyandot were among the first known inhabitants of the countryside that was to become Dublin, Ohio.

The Wyandot had moved to the Ohio countryside after being decimated by disease and a disastrous war with the Five Nations of the Iroquois in their homeland near Georgian Bay. In 1794, General Anthony Wayne defeated the Wyandot and other Ohio American Indian peoples at the Battle of Fallen Timbers, leading to the Wyandot surrendering most of their land in Ohio with the signing of the Treaty of Greenville .

[ 7 ] Chief Shateyaronyah, an important leader known to locals as " Leatherlips ", [ 8 ] [ 9 ] had signed the Treaty of Greenville on August 3, 1795, and encouraged cooperation with white settlers near the end of his life. That policy of accommodating Europeans led to conflict with a movement led by two Shawnee brothers, Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa (The Prophet). Tenskwatawa reacted strongly against Leatherlips and condemned him to death for signing away native lands, and for "witchcraft". More likely was that this was for his refusal to join the Shawnee. Rather than break the pledge that he signed in 1795, Leatherlips was killed in 1810.

[ 10 ] [ 11 ] The Leatherlips sculpture in Scioto Park was created to honor Chief Shateyaronyah in 1990.

[ 8 ] [ 12 ] After the Revolutionary War , the United States Government gave 2,000 acres (810 ha) of land along the Scioto River to Lieutenant James Holt as payment for his service. In 1802, Peter and Benjamin Sells from Huntingdon, Pennsylvania , purchased 400 acres (160 ha) of this land for their brother, John. The site of the John Sells' original purchase is known as Historic Dublin.

[ 13 ] Post-Ohio statehood [ edit ] In 1808, John Sells brought his family to the region, and by 1810, he had begun to survey lots for the new village with his business partner, an Irish gentleman named John Shields. According to historians, Shields is responsible for naming the town after his birthplace: "If I have the honor conferred upon me to name your village, with the brightness of the morn, and the beaming of the sun on the hills and dales surrounding this beautiful valley, it would give me great pleasure to name your new town after my birthplace, Dublin , Ireland." [ 14 ] In 1833, Dublin contained several mills and one store, [ 15 ] and was incorporated in 1881.

[ 16 ] In 1970, Dublin was still a small town with only 681 residents. However, the construction of Interstate 270 facilitated a population boom, spearheaded by the acquisition of major corporate headquarters such as Ashland Inc and Wendy's International . In addition, the growth of the Muirfield Village Golf Club and its residential subdivision attracted people to the rapidly growing suburb . It was then officially declared a city in August 1987, after reaching a population of 5,000 residents.

[ citation needed ] As part of this boom Dublin significantly expanded its area, annexing parts of Washington , Perry , Concord , and Jerome townships.

In 2020, the city began redeveloping the Bridge Street District. The 1,100-acre (450 ha) project includes 400 apartments and condominiums , retail, offices, and other space along the Scioto River .

[ 17 ] During a survey for the new Wexner Medical Center, an African-American cemetery was discovered. In 2024, the city held a dedication ceremony which included local resident descendants of some of the more than 20 people who are buried there.

[ 18 ] Geography [ edit ] According to the United States Census Bureau , the city has a total area of 24.80 square miles (64.23 km 2 ), of which 24.44 square miles (63.30 km 2 ) is land and 0.36 square miles (0.93 km 2 ) is water.

[ 19 ] The Scioto River passes through Dublin. In this area the river and its tributaries cut deep gorges through the limestone bedrock, and the riverbed is stony. Some of these tributaries feature waterfalls .

Topography [ edit ] Located on the Glaciated Allegheny Plateau , Dublin has a relatively flat topography. Nevertheless, there are numerous ravines surrounding the tributaries of the Scioto River, which make for steep cliffs in some areas. Elevations range from 780 feet (240 m) above sea level where the Scioto River leaves the city at Hayden Run Road, while the high point is 1,000 feet (300 m) at Glacier Ridge Metro Park.

[ 34 ] Japanese community [ edit ] See also: Japanese community of Columbus, Ohio Honda first established operations in Marysville in 1979.

And also as of 2010, 122 Japanese live in Union County , making up 0.2% of the county's population; Marysville is in this county.
