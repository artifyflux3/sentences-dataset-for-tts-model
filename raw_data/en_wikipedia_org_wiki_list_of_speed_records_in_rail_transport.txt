Current speed records [ edit ] An L0 Series trainset, holding the non-conventional train world speed record of 603 km/h (375 mph) TGV 4402 (operation V150 ) reaching 574.8 km/h (357 mph) The world record for a conventional wheeled passenger train is held by a modified French TGV high-speed (with standard equipment) code named V150, set in 2007 when it reached 574.8 km/h (357.2 mph) on a 140 km (87 mi) section of LGV Est line, part of the Trans-European high-speed rail network .

[ 1 ] Japan's experimental maglev train L0 Series achieved 603 km/h (375 mph) on a 42.8 km (26.6 mi) magnetic levitation track in 2015.

[ 2 ] Under commercial traffic and practical conditions where trains carry passengers across from one station to another, the world records for top operating speeds of maglev and single-phase trains are held respectively by China's Shanghai Maglev Train with a top speed of 431 km/h (268 mph) and CR400 Fuxing Hao at 350 km/h (220 mph). They are followed by France's TGV Duplex , Japan's E5 Series Shinkansen and the German ICE 3 (when operating in France [ 3 ] ) which all have maximum operating speeds of 320 km/h (200 mph) for commercial services.

[ 75 ] [ 76 ] Note: ^ The speed was measured and recorded using a mechanical device. The record was available for public inspection.

^ This was recorded by Charles Rous-Marten , a highly experienced railway journalist who subsequently published his notebook. But since the times were recorded using a stopwatch they must remain unauthenticated. His stated figure of 102.3 mph comes from a single quarter-mile taking 8.8 seconds on a stopwatch with a 0.2 second minimum interval; the next step, 9.0 seconds, would equate to 100 mph.
