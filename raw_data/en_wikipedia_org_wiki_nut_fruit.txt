For foods called nuts, which may not be true botanical nuts, see Nut (food) . For other kinds of nut, see Nut (disambiguation) .

Fruit with outer shell protecting kernel A nut is a fruit consisting of a hard or tough nutshell protecting a kernel which is usually edible. In general usage and in a culinary sense, many dry seeds are called nuts, but in a botanical context, "nut" implies that the shell does not open to release the seed ( indehiscent ).

[ 1 ] Most seeds come from fruits that naturally free themselves from the shell, but this is not the case in nuts such as hazelnuts , chestnuts , and acorns , which have hard shell walls and originate from a compound ovary.

[ 2 ] Definition [ edit ] Diagram of a shagbark hickory nut A seed is the mature fertilised ovule of a plant; it consists of three parts, the embryo which will develop into a new plant, stored food for the embryo, and a protective seed coat.

Botanically , a nut is a fruit with a woody pericarp developing from a syncarpous gynoecium . Nuts may be contained in an involucre , a cup-shaped structure formed from the flower bracts . The involucre may be scaly, spiny, leafy or tubular, depending on the species of nut.

[ 3 ] Most nuts come from the pistils with inferior ovaries (see flower ) and all are indehiscent (not opening at maturity). True nuts are produced, for example, by some plant families of the order Fagales . These include beech ( Fagus ), chestnut ( Castanea ), oak ( Quercus ), stone-oak ( Lithocarpus ) and tanoak ( Notholithocarpus ) in the family Fagaceae , as well as hazel , filbert ( Corylus ) and hornbeam ( Carpinus ) in the family Betulaceae .

A small nut may be called a "nutlet" (formerly called a nucule, [ 4 ] a term otherwise referring to the oogonium of stoneworts [ 5 ] ). In botany , the term "nutlet" can be used to describe a pyrena or pyrene, which is a seed covered by a stony layer, such as the kernel of a drupe .

[ 6 ] Walnuts and hickories , including pecans , ( Juglandaceae ) have fruits that are difficult to classify. They are considered to be nuts under some definitions but are also referred to as drupaceous nuts.

( January 2025 ) Toxicity [ edit ] See also: Tree nut allergy Nuts used for food are a common source of food allergens.

[ 7 ] Reactions can range from mild symptoms to severe ones, a condition known as anaphylaxis , which can be life-threatening. The reaction is due to the release of histamine by the body in response to an allergen in the nuts, causing skin and other possible reactions .

[ 8 ] Tree nut allergies are distinct from peanut allergy , as peanuts are legumes , whereas a tree nut is a hard-shelled nut; however, experts suggest that a person with an allergy to peanuts should avoid eating tree nuts, and vice versa.

[ 7 ] [ 9 ] Consumption as food [ edit ] Main article: Nut (food) Chocolate cake with hazelnuts Nuts contain the diverse nutrients that are needed for the growth of a new plant.

[ 7 ] Composition varies, but they tend to have a low water and carbohydrate content, with high levels of fats, protein , dietary minerals , and vitamins .

[ 7 ] An Eastern chipmunk ( Tamias striatus ) with a hazelnut in its mouth Nuts are eaten by humans and wildlife.

[ 7 ] Because nuts generally have a high oil content, they are a significant energy source.

[ 7 ] Many seeds are edible by humans and used in cooking, eaten raw, sprouted, or roasted as a snack food , soaked in water and filtered to make nut milk , ground to make nut butters, or pressed for oil that is used in cooking and cosmetics.

[ 7 ] Constituents [ edit ] Nuts are the source of energy and nutrients for the new plant. They contain a relatively large quantity of calories, essential unsaturated and monounsaturated fats including linoleic acid and linolenic acid , vitamins, and essential amino acids.
