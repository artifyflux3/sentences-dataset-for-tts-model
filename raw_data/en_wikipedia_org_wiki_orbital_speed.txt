In [gravitationally bound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_binding_energy "Gravitational binding energy") systems, the **orbital speed** of an [astronomical body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_object "Astronomical object") or object (e.g. [planet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet "Planet"), [moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_satellite "Natural satellite"), [artificial satellite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite "Satellite"), [spacecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft "Spacecraft"), or [star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star "Star")) is the [speed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed "Speed") at which it [orbits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit "Orbit") around either the [barycenter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barycenter "Barycenter") (the combined center of mass) or, if one body is much more massive than the other bodies of the system combined, its speed relative to the [center of mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_mass "Center of mass") of the [most massive body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_body "Primary body").

The term can be used to refer to either the mean orbital speed (i.e. the average speed over an entire orbit) or its instantaneous speed at a particular point in its orbit. The maximum (instantaneous) orbital speed occurs at [periapsis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsis "Apsis") (perigee, perihelion, etc.), while the minimum speed for objects in closed orbits occurs at apoapsis (apogee, aphelion, etc.). In ideal [two-body systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-body_problem "Two-body problem"), objects in open orbits continue to slow down forever as their distance to the barycenter increases.

When a system approximates a two-body system, instantaneous orbital speed at a given point of the orbit can be computed from its distance to the central body and the object's [specific orbital energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_orbital_energy "Specific orbital energy"), sometimes called "total energy". Specific orbital energy is constant and independent of position.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_speed#cite_note-lissauer2019-1)

Radial trajectories
-------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Orbital_speed&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Radial trajectories")]

In the following, it is assumed that the system is a two-body system and the orbiting object has a negligible mass compared to the larger (central) object. In real-world orbital mechanics, it is the system's barycenter, not the larger object, which is at the focus.

[Specific orbital energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_orbital_energy "Specific orbital energy"), or total energy, is equal to _E_ k−_E_ p (the difference between kinetic energy and potential energy). The sign of the result may be positive, zero, or negative and the sign tells us something about the type of orbit:[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_speed#cite_note-lissauer2019-1)

*   If the [specific orbital energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_orbital_energy "Specific orbital energy") is positive the orbit is unbound, or open, and will follow a [hyperbola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbola "Hyperbola") with the larger body the [focus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_(geometry) "Focus (geometry)") of the hyperbola. Objects in open orbits do not return; once past periapsis their distance from the focus increases without bound. See [radial hyperbolic trajectory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radial_hyperbolic_trajectory "Radial hyperbolic trajectory")
*   If the total energy is zero, (_E_ k=_E_ p): the orbit is a [parabola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabola "Parabola") with [focus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_(geometry) "Focus (geometry)") at the other body. See [radial parabolic trajectory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radial_parabolic_trajectory "Radial parabolic trajectory"). Parabolic orbits are also open.
*   If the total energy is negative, _E_ k − _E_ p< 0: The orbit is bound, or closed. The motion will be on an [ellipse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipse "Ellipse") with one [focus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_(geometry) "Focus (geometry)") at the other body. See [radial elliptic trajectory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radial_elliptic_trajectory "Radial elliptic trajectory"), [free-fall time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-fall_time "Free-fall time"). Planets have bound orbits around the Sun.

Transverse orbital speed
------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Orbital_speed&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Transverse orbital speed")]

The [transverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transverse_direction "Transverse direction") orbital speed is inversely proportional to the distance to the central body because of the law of conservation of [angular momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_momentum "Angular momentum"), or equivalently, [Kepler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Kepler "Johannes Kepler")'s [second law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_laws_of_planetary_motion "Kepler's laws of planetary motion"). This states that as a body moves around its orbit during a fixed amount of time, the line from the barycenter to the body sweeps a constant area of the orbital plane, regardless of which part of its orbit the body traces during that period of time.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_speed#cite_note-2)

This law implies that the body moves slower near its [apoapsis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoapsis "Apoapsis") than near its [periapsis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periapsis "Periapsis"), because at the smaller distance along the arc it needs to move faster to cover the same area.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_speed#cite_note-lissauer2019-1)

For orbits with small [eccentricity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eccentricity_(orbit) "Eccentricity (orbit)"), the length of the orbit is close to that of a circular one, and the mean orbital speed can be approximated either from observations of the [orbital period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_period "Orbital period") and the [semimajor axis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semimajor_axis "Semimajor axis") of its orbit, or from knowledge of the [masses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass "Mass") of the two bodies and the semimajor axis.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_speed#cite_note-3)

![Image 1: {\displaystyle v\approx {2\pi a \over T}\approx {\sqrt {\mu  \over a}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c86493d99fd1b940ca6e1ed1fdc0157c86580263)
where _v_ is the orbital velocity, _a_ is the [length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length "Length") of the [semimajor axis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semimajor_axis "Semimajor axis"), _T_ is the orbital period, and _μ_ = _GM_ is the [standard gravitational parameter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_gravitational_parameter "Standard gravitational parameter"). This is an approximation that only holds true when the orbiting body is of considerably lesser mass than the central one, and eccentricity is close to zero.

When one of the bodies is not of considerably lesser mass see: [Gravitational two-body problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_two-body_problem "Gravitational two-body problem")

So, when one of the masses is almost negligible compared to the other mass, as the case for [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth") and [Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun "Sun"), one can approximate the orbit velocity ![Image 2: {\displaystyle v_{o}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ccb64ce4687f1ac02ef3ad2175694ea72bfe950e) as:[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_speed#cite_note-lissauer2019-1)

![Image 3: {\displaystyle v_{o}\approx {\sqrt {\frac {GM}{r}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ff5595cb6d81d417863e0f83dfa78c4e7dc0479d)
or:

![Image 4: {\displaystyle v_{o}\approx {\frac {v_{e}}{\sqrt {2}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bb2ae1bb1e77931d72a0f31eae45884f85c63703)
Where _M_ is the (greater) mass around which this negligible mass or body is orbiting, and _v e_ is the [escape velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_velocity "Escape velocity") at a distance from the center of the primary body equal to the radius of the orbit.

For an object in an eccentric orbit orbiting a much larger body, the length of the orbit decreases with [orbital eccentricity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_eccentricity "Orbital eccentricity")_e_, and is an [ellipse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipse#Circumference "Ellipse"). This can be used to obtain a more accurate estimate of the average orbital speed:[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_speed#cite_note-4)

![Image 5: {\displaystyle v_{o}={\frac {2\pi a}{T}}\left[1-{\frac {1}{4}}e^{2}-{\frac {3}{64}}e^{4}-{\frac {5}{256}}e^{6}-{\frac {175}{16384}}e^{8}-\cdots \right]}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ad5791feac5142d389ffda8b958ab12c3ac7de32)
The mean orbital speed decreases with eccentricity.

Instantaneous orbital speed
---------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Orbital_speed&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Instantaneous orbital speed")]

For the instantaneous orbital speed of a body at any given point in its trajectory, both the mean distance and the instantaneous distance are taken into account:

![Image 6: {\displaystyle v={\sqrt {\mu \left({2 \over r}-{1 \over a}\right)}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9d733c1c483f781ff1c83c4d1a178f9050d24d18)
where _μ_ is the [standard gravitational parameter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_gravitational_parameter "Standard gravitational parameter") of the orbited body, _r_ is the distance at which the speed is to be calculated, and _a_ is the length of the semi-major axis of the elliptical orbit. This expression is called the [vis-viva equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vis-viva_equation "Vis-viva equation").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_speed#cite_note-lissauer2019-1)

For the Earth at [perihelion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perihelion "Perihelion"), the value is:

![Image 7: {\displaystyle {\sqrt {1.327\times 10^{20}~{\text{m}}^{3}{\text{s}}^{-2}\cdot \left({2 \over 1.471\times 10^{11}~{\text{m}}}-{1 \over 1.496\times 10^{11}~{\text{m}}}\right)}}\approx 30,300~{\text{m}}/{\text{s}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fc3a66102e09b864b6df3ff0db936ed104fc5c04)
which is slightly faster than Earth's average orbital speed of 29,800 m/s (67,000 mph), as expected from [Kepler's 2nd Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_laws_of_planetary_motion#Second_law "Kepler's laws of planetary motion").

The lower axis gives orbital speeds of some orbits.

The closer an object is to the Sun the faster it needs to move to maintain the orbit. Objects move fastest at perihelion (closest approach to the Sun) and slowest at aphelion (furthest distance from the Sun). Since planets in the Solar System are in nearly circular orbits their individual orbital velocities do not vary much. Being closest to the Sun and having the most eccentric orbit, Mercury's orbital speed varies from about 59 km/s at perihelion to 39 km/s at aphelion.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_speed#cite_note-Mercury-5)
