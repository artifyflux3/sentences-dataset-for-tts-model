Bloomsbury's head office is located on Bedford Square [ 3 ] in Bloomsbury , an area of the London Borough of Camden . It has a US publishing office located in New York City , an India publishing office in New Delhi , an Australian sales office in Sydney CBD , and other publishing offices in the UK, including in Oxford . It is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index .

[ 4 ] History [ edit ] The company was founded in 1986 by Nigel Newton , who  had previously been employed by other publishing companies. It was floated as a public registered company in 1994, raising £5.5 million, which was used to fund expansion of the company into paperback and children's books.

For most of its existence, Bloomsbury was a minor player in the British publishing scene. In 1997, Bloomsbury took a chance on publishing the Harry Potter series after it had been rejected by multiple publishers. That decision catapulted the company’s fortunes, as Harry Potter would go on to become the best-selling book series in history.

A rights issue of shares in 1998 further raised £6.1 million, which was used to expand the company, in particular to found a U.S. branch. In 1998, Bloomsbury USA was established. Bloomsbury USA Books for Young Readers was established in 2002, and in 2005, Bloomsbury acquired Walker & Co, a small company dedicated to publishing nonfiction.

[ 5 ] The Walker brand was discontinued in 2015 and sold to Walker Publishing Company.

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] In December 2008, Bloomsbury opened a branch in Doha, Qatar in a joint-partnership with Qatar Foundation .

[ 8 ] The partnership created a publishing house, Bloomsbury Qatar Foundation Publishing ; it worked mainly with English and Arabic literature.

[ 9 ] Bloomsbury Qatar Foundation Journals (BQFJ), an open access and peer reviewed academic publisher, was created in December 2010 as a joint venture with Qatar Foundation. Journal research articles were published through BQFJ's website QScience.com .

[ 10 ] The company's partnership with Qatar Foundation ended in December 2015 and all of Bloomsbury Qatar Foundation Publishing works were incorporated in Qatari-owned HBKU Press. At the time of BQFP's dissolution it had published over 200 books. BQFJ's works were also incorporated in HBKU Press.

[ 11 ] In 2012, Bloomsbury established a publishing office in India .

[ 12 ] In 2018, an article disclosed that much of the profit in the children's division was due to the Harry Potter series by J. K. Rowling .

[ 13 ] In May 2023, an article in The Verge reported that the cover of the UK edition of House of Earth and Blood , published by Bloomsbury, uses an AI-generated image.

[ 14 ] Acquisitions and imprints [ edit ] Among the companies, book lists and imprints that Bloomsbury has acquired are: [ 15 ] Bloomsbury Academic (1986) A & C Black (2000) Whitaker's Almanack (2002) T & AD Poyser (2002) Thomas Reed Publications (2002) Peter Collin Publishing (2002) Andrew Brodie Publications (2003) Adlard Coles Nautical (2003) Walker Publishing Company (2004) Methuen Drama (2006) Berg Publishers (2008) John Wisden & Co (2008) Arden Shakespeare (2008) Tottel Publishing (2009) Bristol Classical Press (2010) Continuum International Publishing Group (2011) Absolute Press (2011) [ 16 ] Fairchild Books (2012) Applied Visual Arts Publishing (2012) Hart Publishing (2013) Osprey Publishing (2014) I.B.
