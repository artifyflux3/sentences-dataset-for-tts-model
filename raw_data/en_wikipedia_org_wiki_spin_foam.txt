These structures are employed in loop quantum gravity as a version of quantum foam .

In loop quantum gravity [ edit ] Main article: Loop quantum gravity The covariant formulation of loop quantum gravity provides the best formulation of the dynamics of the theory of quantum gravity – a quantum field theory where the invariance under diffeomorphisms of general relativity applies. The resulting path integral represents a sum over all the possible configurations of spin foam.

[ how?

] Spin network [ edit ] Main article: Spin network A spin network is a two-dimensional graph , together with labels on its vertices and edges which encode aspects of a spatial geometry.

A spin network is defined as a diagram like the Feynman diagram which makes a basis of connections between the elements of a differentiable manifold for the Hilbert spaces defined over them, and for computations of amplitudes between two different hypersurfaces of the manifold . Any evolution of the spin network provides a spin foam over a manifold of one dimension higher than the dimensions of the corresponding spin network.

[ clarification needed ] A spin foam is analogous to quantum history .

[ why?

] Spacetime [ edit ] Spin networks provide a language to describe the quantum geometry of space. Spin foam does the same job for spacetime.

Spacetime can be defined as a superposition of spin foams, which is a generalized Feynman diagram where instead of a graph, a higher-dimensional complex is used. In topology this sort of space is called a 2- complex . A spin foam is a particular type of 2- complex , with labels for vertices , edges and faces . The boundary of a spin foam is a spin network, just as in the theory of manifolds, where the boundary of an n-manifold is an (n-1)-manifold.

In loop quantum gravity, the present spin foam theory has been inspired by the work of Ponzano–Regge model . The idea was introduced by Reisenberger and Rovelli in 1997, [ 2 ] and later developed into the Barrett–Crane model . The formulation that is used nowadays is commonly called EPRL after the names of the authors of a series of seminal papers, [ 3 ] but the theory has also seen fundamental contributions from the work of many others, such as Laurent Freidel (FK model) and Jerzy Lewandowski (KKL model).

Definition [ edit ] The summary partition function for a spin foam model is Z := ∑ ∑ Γ Γ w ( Γ Γ ) [ ∑ ∑ j f , i e ∏ ∏ f A f ( j f ) ∏ ∏ e A e ( j f , i e ) ∏ ∏ v A v ( j f , i e ) ] {\displaystyle Z:=\sum _{\Gamma }w(\Gamma )\left[\sum _{j_{f},i_{e}}\prod _{f}A_{f}(j_{f})\prod _{e}A_{e}(j_{f},i_{e})\prod _{v}A_{v}(j_{f},i_{e})\right]} with: a set of 2-complexes Γ Γ {\displaystyle \Gamma } each consisting out of faces f {\displaystyle f} , edges e {\displaystyle e} and vertices v {\displaystyle v} . Associated to each 2-complex Γ Γ {\displaystyle \Gamma } is a weight w ( Γ Γ ) {\displaystyle w(\Gamma )} a set of irreducible representations j {\displaystyle j} which label the faces and intertwiners i {\displaystyle i} which label the edges.

a vertex amplitude A v ( j f , i e ) {\displaystyle A_{v}(j_{f},i_{e})} and an edge amplitude A e ( j f , i e ) {\displaystyle A_{e}(j_{f},i_{e})} a face amplitude A f ( j f ) {\displaystyle A_{f}(j_{f})} , for which we almost always have A f ( j f ) = dim ⁡ ⁡ ( j f ) {\displaystyle A_{f}(j_{f})=\dim(j_{f})} See also [ edit ] Group field theory Loop quantum gravity Lorentz invariance in loop quantum gravity String-net liquid References [ edit ] ^ Perez, Alejandro (2004).
