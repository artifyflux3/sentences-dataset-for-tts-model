The Gulf of Oman or Sea of Oman ( Arabic : خليج عمان khalīj ʿumān ; Persian : دریای عمان daryâ-ye omân ), also known as Gulf of Makran or Sea of Makran ( Arabic : خلیج مکران khalīj makrān ; Persian : دریای مکران daryâ-ye makrān ), is a gulf in the Indian Ocean that connects the Arabian Sea with the Strait of Hormuz , which then runs to the Persian Gulf . It borders Iran and Pakistan on the north, Oman on the south, and the United Arab Emirates on the west.

Extent The International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of the Gulf of Oman as follows: [ 1 ] On the Northwest: A line joining Ràs Limah (25°57'N) on the coast of Arabia and Ràs al Kuh (25°48'N) on the coast of Iran (Persia).

On the Southeast: The Northern limit of the Arabian Sea [A line joining Ràs al Hadd , East point of Arabia (22°32'N) and Ràs Jiyùni (61°43'E) on the coast of Pakistan ].

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] Makran Sea Akhzar Sea Persian Sea (consists of the whole of the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman) Until the 18th century, it was known as Makran Sea and is also visible on historical maps and museums.

[ 11 ] Ecology Further information: Gulf of Oman desert and semi-desert and Persian Gulf § Wildlife In 2018, scientists confirmed the Gulf of Oman contains one of the world's largest marine dead zones , where the ocean contains little or no oxygen and marine wildlife cannot exist. The dead zone encompasses nearly the entire 165,000-square-kilometre (63,700 sq mi) Gulf of Oman and equivalent to the size of Florida, United States of America. The cause is a combination of increased ocean warming and increased runoff of nitrogen and phosphorus from fertilizers.

[ 12 ] International underwater rail tunnel In 2018, a rail tunnel under the sea was suggested to link the UAE with the western coast of India. The bullet train tunnel would be supported by pontoons and be nearly 2,000 kilometres (1,200 mi) in length.
