[ 2 ] He received a PhD in 1969 from Columbia University ( Functional Morphology of Locomotion in Birds ).

[ 2 ] His research interests include: theory and methods of comparative biology, evolutionary theory, biological diversification, systematics, the evolution of morphological systems, historical biogeography, molecular systematics and evolution.

[ 1 ] From 1970 he has been a research associate at the Field Museum of Natural History , Chicago; from 1970 to 1992, full professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago ; from 1993 to 1994, acting director of the Center for Biodiversity and Conservation at the American Museum of Natural History ; from 1992, adjunct professor at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York ; from 1997 adjunct professor at Columbia University ; from 1992 curator at American Museum of Natural History; and from 2002 Lamont Curator of Birds at American Museum of Natural History.
