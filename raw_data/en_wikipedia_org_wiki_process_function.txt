As an example, mechanical work and heat are process functions because they describe quantitatively the transition between equilibrium states of a thermodynamic system.

Path functions depend on the path taken to reach one state from another. Different routes give different quantities. Examples of path functions include work , heat and arc length .  In contrast to path functions, state functions are independent of the path taken. Thermodynamic state variables are point functions, differing from path functions. For a given state, considered as a point, there is a definite value for each state variable and state function.

Infinitesimal changes in a process function X are often indicated by δX to distinguish them from infinitesimal changes in a state function Y which is written dY . The quantity dY is an exact differential , while δX is not, it is an inexact differential . Infinitesimal changes in a process function may be integrated, but the integral between two states depends on the particular path taken between the two states, whereas the integral of a state function is simply the difference of the state functions at the two points, independent of the path taken.

In general, a process function X may be either holonomic or non-holonomic. For a holonomic process function, an auxiliary state function (or integrating factor) λ may be defined such that Y = λX is a state function. For a non-holonomic process function, no such function may be defined. In other words, for a holonomic process function, λ may be defined such that dY = λδX is an exact differential. For example, thermodynamic work is a holonomic process function since the integrating factor λ = ⁠ 1 / p ⁠ (where p is pressure) will yield exact differential of the volume state function dV = ⁠ δW / p ⁠ . The second law of thermodynamics as stated by Carathéodory essentially amounts to the statement that heat is a holonomic process function since the integrating factor λ = ⁠ 1 / T ⁠ (where T is temperature) will yield the exact differential of an entropy state function dS = ⁠ δQ / T ⁠ .
