A sanctuary area is a type of New Zealand protected area . They exist to preserve populations of important forest types, like the remnants of kauri forests in Northland .

[ 1 ] Sanctuary areas are relatively rare. Like ecological areas , most sanctuary areas were set aside by the now defunct New Zealand Forest Service in the 1970s and 1970s in response to activism by the conservationist movement .

[ 1 ] The 9,105-hectare Waipoua Forest Sanctuary , featuring giant kauri such as Tāne Mahuta , was established as the first Sanctuary Area in 1952.

[ 1 ] The Whirinaki Sanctuary, created in the 1980s to protect the podocarp forests of Whirinaki Forest Park , was one of the last to be established.

[ 1 ] The Land Information New Zealand website lists 10 sanctuary areas recognised by the New Zealand Geographic Board : [ 2 ] Te Arai Sanctuary , Northland Wairaki Forest Sanctuary , Auckland Otawa Sanctuary Area , Bay of Plenty , Bay of Plenty Sugar Loaf Islands Sanctuary , Taranaki Ngā Motu / Sugar Loaf Islands Sanctuary , Taranaki Oapui Sanctuary , Taranaki Erua Forest Sanctuary , Manawatū-Whanganui Esk Kiwi Sanctuary , Hawke's Bay Hihitahi Forest Sanctuary , Manawatū-Whanganui Rocky Hills Sanctuary Area , Wellington References [ edit ] ^ a b c d Molloy, Les.
