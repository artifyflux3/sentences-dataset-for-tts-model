Matrix multiplication is an example.

A bilinear map can also be defined for modules . For that, see the article pairing .

Definition [ edit ] Vector spaces [ edit ] Let V , W {\displaystyle V,W} and X {\displaystyle X} be three vector spaces over the same base field F {\displaystyle F} . A bilinear map is a function B : V × × W → → X {\displaystyle B:V\times W\to X} such that for all w ∈ ∈ W {\displaystyle w\in W} , the map B w {\displaystyle B_{w}} v ↦ ↦ B ( v , w ) {\displaystyle v\mapsto B(v,w)} is a linear map from V {\displaystyle V} to X , {\displaystyle X,} and for all v ∈ ∈ V {\displaystyle v\in V} , the map B v {\displaystyle B_{v}} w ↦ ↦ B ( v , w ) {\displaystyle w\mapsto B(v,w)} is a linear map from W {\displaystyle W} to X .

{\displaystyle X.} In other words, when we hold the first entry of the bilinear map fixed while letting the second entry vary, the result is a linear operator, and similarly for when we hold the second entry fixed.

Such a map B {\displaystyle B} satisfies the following properties.

For any λ λ ∈ ∈ F {\displaystyle \lambda \in F} , B ( λ λ v , w ) = B ( v , λ λ w ) = λ λ B ( v , w ) .

{\displaystyle B(\lambda v,w)=B(v,\lambda w)=\lambda B(v,w).} The map B {\displaystyle B} is additive in both components: if v 1 , v 2 ∈ ∈ V {\displaystyle v_{1},v_{2}\in V} and w 1 , w 2 ∈ ∈ W , {\displaystyle w_{1},w_{2}\in W,} then B ( v 1 + v 2 , w ) = B ( v 1 , w ) + B ( v 2 , w ) {\displaystyle B(v_{1}+v_{2},w)=B(v_{1},w)+B(v_{2},w)} and B ( v , w 1 + w 2 ) = B ( v , w 1 ) + B ( v , w 2 ) .

{\displaystyle B(v,w_{1}+w_{2})=B(v,w_{1})+B(v,w_{2}).} If V = W {\displaystyle V=W} and we have B ( v , w ) = B ( w , v ) for all v , w ∈ ∈ V , {\displaystyle v,w\in V,} then we say that B is symmetric .  If X is the base field F , then the map is called a bilinear form , which are well-studied (for example: scalar product , inner product , and quadratic form ).

Modules [ edit ] The definition works without any changes if instead of vector spaces over a field F , we use modules over a commutative ring R . It generalizes to n -ary functions, where the proper term is multilinear .

For non-commutative rings R and S , a left R -module M and a right S -module N , a bilinear map is a map B : M × N → T with T an ( R , S ) - bimodule , and for which any n in N , m ↦ B ( m , n ) is an R -module homomorphism, and for any m in M , n ↦ B ( m , n ) is an S -module homomorphism.  This satisfies B ( r ⋅ m , n ) = r ⋅ B ( m , n ) B ( m , n ⋅ s ) = B ( m , n ) ⋅ s for all m in M , n in N , r in R and s in S , as well as B being additive in each argument.

Properties [ edit ] An immediate consequence of the definition is that B ( v , w ) = 0 X whenever v = 0 V or w = 0 W . This may be seen by writing the zero vector 0 V as 0 ⋅ 0 V (and similarly for 0 W ) and moving the scalar 0 "outside", in front of B , by linearity.

The set L ( V , W ; X ) of all bilinear maps is a linear subspace of the space ( viz.

vector space , module ) of all maps from V × W into X .

If V , W , X are finite-dimensional , then so is L ( V , W ; X ) . For X = F , {\displaystyle X=F,} that is, bilinear forms, the dimension of this space is dim V × dim W (while the space L ( V × W ; F ) of linear forms is of dimension dim V + dim W ). To see this, choose a basis for V and W ; then each bilinear map can be uniquely represented by the matrix B ( e i , f j ) , and vice versa. 
Now, if X is a space of higher dimension, we obviously have dim L ( V , W ; X ) = dim V × dim W × dim X .

Examples [ edit ] Matrix multiplication is a bilinear map M( m , n ) × M( n , p ) → M( m , p ) .

If a vector space V over the real numbers R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } carries an inner product , then the inner product is a bilinear map V × × V → → R .

{\displaystyle V\times V\to \mathbb {R} .} In general, for a vector space V over a field F , a bilinear form on V is the same as a bilinear map V × V → F .

If V is a vector space with dual space V ∗ , then the canonical evaluation map , b ( f , v ) = f ( v ) is a bilinear map from V ∗ × V to the base field.

Let V and W be vector spaces over the same base field F . If f is a member of V ∗ and g a member of W ∗ , then b ( v , w ) = f ( v ) g ( w ) defines a bilinear map V × W → F .

The cross product in R 3 {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}} is a bilinear map R 3 × × R 3 → → R 3 .

{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}\times \mathbb {R} ^{3}\to \mathbb {R} ^{3}.} Let B : V × × W → → X {\displaystyle B:V\times W\to X} be a bilinear map, and L : U → → W {\displaystyle L:U\to W} be a linear map , then ( v , u ) ↦ B ( v , Lu ) is a bilinear map on V × U .

Continuity and separate continuity [ edit ] Suppose X , Y , {\displaystyle X,Y,} and Z {\displaystyle Z} are topological vector spaces and let b : X × × Y → → Z {\displaystyle b:X\times Y\to Z} be a bilinear map. 
Then b is said to be separately continuous if the following two conditions hold: for all x ∈ ∈ X , {\displaystyle x\in X,} the map Y → → Z {\displaystyle Y\to Z} given by y ↦ ↦ b ( x , y ) {\displaystyle y\mapsto b(x,y)} is continuous; for all y ∈ ∈ Y , {\displaystyle y\in Y,} the map X → → Z {\displaystyle X\to Z} given by x ↦ ↦ b ( x , y ) {\displaystyle x\mapsto b(x,y)} is continuous.

Many separately continuous bilinear that are not continuous satisfy an additional property: hypocontinuity .

[ 1 ] All continuous bilinear maps are hypocontinuous.

Sufficient conditions for continuity [ edit ] Many bilinear maps that occur in practice are separately continuous but not all are continuous. 
We list here sufficient conditions for a separately continuous bilinear map to be continuous.

If X is a Baire space and Y is metrizable then every separately continuous bilinear map b : X × × Y → → Z {\displaystyle b:X\times Y\to Z} is continuous.

[ 1 ] If X , Y , and Z {\displaystyle X,Y,{\text{ and }}Z} are the strong duals of Fréchet spaces then every separately continuous bilinear map b : X × × Y → → Z {\displaystyle b:X\times Y\to Z} is continuous.

[ 1 ] If a bilinear map is continuous at (0, 0) then it is continuous everywhere.

[ 2 ] Composition map [ edit ] See also: Topology of uniform convergence Let X , Y , and Z {\displaystyle X,Y,{\text{ and }}Z} be locally convex Hausdorff spaces and let C : L ( X ; Y ) × × L ( Y ; Z ) → → L ( X ; Z ) {\displaystyle C:L(X;Y)\times L(Y;Z)\to L(X;Z)} be the composition map defined by C ( u , v ) := v ∘ ∘ u .

{\displaystyle C(u,v):=v\circ u.} In general, the bilinear map C {\displaystyle C} is not continuous (no matter what topologies the spaces of linear maps are given). 
We do, however, have the following results: Give all three spaces of linear maps one of the following topologies: give all three the topology of bounded convergence; give all three the topology of compact convergence ; give all three the topology of pointwise convergence .

If E {\displaystyle E} is an equicontinuous subset of L ( Y ; Z ) {\displaystyle L(Y;Z)} then the restriction C | L ( X ; Y ) × × E : L ( X ; Y ) × × E → → L ( X ; Z ) {\displaystyle C{\big \vert }_{L(X;Y)\times E}:L(X;Y)\times E\to L(X;Z)} is continuous for all three topologies.

[ 1 ] If Y {\displaystyle Y} is a barreled space then for every sequence ( u i ) i = 1 ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \left(u_{i}\right)_{i=1}^{\infty }} converging to u {\displaystyle u} in L ( X ; Y ) {\displaystyle L(X;Y)} and every sequence ( v i ) i = 1 ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \left(v_{i}\right)_{i=1}^{\infty }} converging to v {\displaystyle v} in L ( Y ; Z ) , {\displaystyle L(Y;Z),} the sequence ( v i ∘ ∘ u i ) i = 1 ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \left(v_{i}\circ u_{i}\right)_{i=1}^{\infty }} converges to v ∘ ∘ u {\displaystyle v\circ u} in L ( Y ; Z ) .
