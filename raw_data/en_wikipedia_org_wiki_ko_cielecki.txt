They used the Ogończyk coat of arms .

The Kościeleccy came from Dobrzyń Land , from the regions around Skępe but signed themselves as
"of Kościelca, near Inowrocław " where another branch of the family resided.

Members of the family were voivodes of Inowrocław, Brześć Kujawski , Poznań , Kalisz , starostas of Kujawy , Pomorze and Wielkopolska , as well as bishops of Chełm . After the Thirteen Years' War many of them also served at the court of King of Poland which allowed them to amass considerable land and wealth.
