The specific weight , also known as the unit weight (symbol γ , the Greek letter gamma ), is a volume-specific quantity defined as the weight W divided by the volume V of a material: γ γ = W / V {\displaystyle \gamma =W/V} Equivalently, it may also be formulated as the product of density , ρ , and gravity acceleration , g : γ γ = ρ ρ g {\displaystyle \gamma =\rho \,g} Its unit of measurement in the International System of Units (SI) is newton per cubic metre (N/m 3 ), with base units of kg ⋅ m −2 ⋅ s −2 .
A commonly used value is the specific weight of water on Earth at 4 °C (39 °F), which is 9.807 kilonewtons per cubic metre or 62.43 pounds-force per cubic foot .

[ 1 ] Discussion [ edit ] The density of a material is defined as mass divided by volume, typically expressed in units of kg/m 3 . 
Unlike density, specific weight is not a fixed property of a material, as it depends on the value of the gravitational acceleration , which varies with location (e.g., Earth's gravity ). 
For simplicity, the standard gravity (a constant) is often assumed, usually taken as 9.81 m/s 2 .

Pressure may also affect values, depending upon the bulk modulus of the material, but generally, at moderate pressures, has a less significant effect than the other factors.

[ 2 ] Applications [ edit ] Fluid mechanics [ edit ] In fluid mechanics , specific weight represents the force exerted by gravity on a unit volume of a fluid.  For this reason, units are expressed as force per unit volume (e.g., N/m 3 or lbf/ft 3 ).  Specific weight can be used as a characteristic property of a fluid.

[ 2 ] Soil mechanics [ edit ] Specific weight is often used as a property of soil to solve earthwork problems.

In soil mechanics, specific weight may refer to: Moist unit weight The unit weight of a soil when void spaces of the soil contain both water and air.

γ γ = ( 1 + w ) G s γ γ w 1 + e {\displaystyle \gamma ={\frac {(1+w)G_{s}\gamma _{w}}{1+e}}} where γ is the moist unit weight of the material γ w is the unit weight of water w is the moisture content of the material G s is the specific gravity of the solid e is the void ratio Dry unit weight The unit weight of a soil when all void spaces of the soil are completely filled with air, with no water.

The formula for dry unit weight is: γ γ d = G s γ γ w 1 + e = γ γ 1 + w {\displaystyle \gamma _{d}={\frac {G_{s}\gamma _{w}}{1+e}}={\frac {\gamma }{1+w}}} where γ is the moist unit weight of the material γ d is the dry unit weight of the material γ w is the unit weight of water w is the moisture content of the material G s is the specific gravity of the solid e is the void ratio Saturated unit weight The unit weight of a soil when all void spaces of the soil are completely filled with water, with no air.

The formula for saturated unit weight is: γ γ s = ( G s + e ) γ γ w 1 + e {\displaystyle \gamma _{s}={\frac {(G_{s}+e)\gamma _{w}}{1+e}}} where γ s is the saturated unit weight of the material γ w is the unit weight of water G s is the specific gravity of the solid e is the void ratio [ 3 ] Submerged unit weight The difference between the saturated unit weight and the unit weight of water.

[ 4 ] It is often used in the calculation of the effective stress in a soil.

The formula for submerged unit weight is: γ γ ′ = γ γ s − − γ γ w {\displaystyle \gamma '=\gamma _{s}-\gamma _{w}} where γ ′ is the submerged unit weight of the material γ s is the saturated unit weight of the material γ w is the unit weight of water Civil and mechanical engineering [ edit ] Specific weight can be used in civil engineering and mechanical engineering to determine the weight of a structure designed to carry certain loads while remaining intact and remaining within limits regarding deformation .
