His writings seem to have been of very great importance and value.

[ 2 ] They are repeatedly referred to by the ancient writers, under many titles, of which, however, most, if not all, seem to have been chapters of his great biographical work, which is often quoted under the title of Lives ( Bioi ). The work contained the biographies of a great many ancient figures, including orators, poets, historians, and philosophers. It contained the earliest known biography of Aristotle , as well as philosophers such as Pythagoras , Empedocles , Heraclitus , Democritus , Zeno , Socrates , Plato , Antisthenes , Diogenes , Stilpo , Epicurus , Theophrastus , Heraclides , Demetrius Phalereus , and Chrysippus . The work has been lost, but many later Lives extensively quote it.

Josephus and Origen cite Hermippus to argue that Pythagoras owed a debt to Judaism .
