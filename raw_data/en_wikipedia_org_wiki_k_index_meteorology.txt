According to the National Weather Service , the index harnesses measurements such as "vertical temperature lapse rate , moisture content of the lower atmosphere , and the vertical extent of the moist layer." [ 1 ] It was developed by the American meteorologist Joseph J. George, and published in the 1960 book Weather Forecasting for Aeronautics .

[ 2 ] Definition [ edit ] The index is derived arithmetically by: [ 3 ] K = ( T 850 − − T 500 ) + T d 850 − − ( T 700 − − T d 700 ) {\displaystyle K=(T_{850}-T_{500})+T_{d_{850}}-(T_{700}-T_{d_{700}})} Where : T d 850 {\displaystyle T_{d_{850}}} = Dew point at 850 hPa T 850 {\displaystyle T_{850}} = Temperature at 850 hPa T d 700 {\displaystyle T_{d_{700}}} = Dew point at 700 hPa T 700 {\displaystyle T_{700}} = Temperature at 700 hPa T 500 {\displaystyle T_{500}} = Temperature at 500 hPa Interpretation [ edit ] The K Index is related to the probability of occurrence of a thunderstorm. It was developed with the idea that Potential = 4 x (KI - 15) , which gives the following interpretation: [ 1 ] [ 4 ] K-index values vs. Thunderstorm Probability K-index value (in °C) Thunderstorm Probability Less than 20 None 20 to 25 Isolated thunderstorms 26 to 30 Widely scattered thunderstorms 31 to 35 Scattered thunderstorms Above 35 Numerous thunderstorms References [ edit ] ^ a b "K-Index" .
