Indexing CODEN ( alt ) · JSTOR ( alt ) · LCCN ( alt ) MIAR · NLM ( alt ) · Scopus · W&L ISSN 2371-2570 Links Journal homepage Feminist Philosophy Quarterly (FPQ) is an online, open access , peer-reviewed journal dedicated to promoting feminist philosophical scholarship.

[ 1 ] Founded on 22 July 2015, [ 2 ] the journal is published quarterly and strives to include and incorporate the entirety of feminist philosophy across the world and including different traditions. The editors-in-chief are Samantha Brennan , Carla Fehr , Alice MacLachlan, [ 3 ] and Kathryn Norlock ; Brennan also served as a co-founder of the journal.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] The journal aims to enhance feminist philosophers' and women's position in the philosophical sphere and the world at large, as well as being a platform for philosophical research that engages the issues faced by wider society. FPQ prioritises aligning itself with people who work towards fighting oppression and achieving equality and fairness.

[ 6 ] Taking issues of bias in publication seriously, FPQ has a triple-anonymous review policy. This means that authors, editors, and reviewers are all anonymous to one another. In addition to publishing peer reviewed scholarly articles, the journal also publishes a variety of invited and submitted symposia.

FPQ's online platform is hosted by Digital Commons (powered by bepress ) at Scholarship at Western, in turn by Western University .
