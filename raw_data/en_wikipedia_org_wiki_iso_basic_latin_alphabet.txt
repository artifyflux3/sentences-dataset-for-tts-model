The **ISO basic Latin alphabet** is an international standard (beginning with ISO/IEC 646) for a [Latin-script alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin-script_alphabet "Latin-script alphabet") that consists of two sets ([uppercase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case "Letter case") and lowercase) of 26 letters, codified in[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_basic_Latin_alphabet#cite_note-terena-1) various national and [international standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_standards "International standards") and used widely in [international communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_communication "International communication"). They are the same letters that comprise the current [English alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_alphabet "English alphabet"). Since medieval times, they are also the same letters of the modern [Latin alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_alphabet "Latin alphabet"). The order is also important for sorting words into [alphabetical order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabetical_order "Alphabetical order").

The two sets contain the following 26 letters each:[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_basic_Latin_alphabet#cite_note-terena-1)

ISO basic Latin alphabet | Uppercase letter set | [A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A "A") | [B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B "B") | [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C "C") | [D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D "D") | [E](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E "E") | [F](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F "F") | [G](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G "G") | [H](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H "H") | [I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I "I") | [J](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J "J") | [K](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K "K") | [L](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L "L") | [M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M "M") | [N](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N "N") | [O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O "O") | [P](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P "P") | [Q](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q "Q") | [R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R "R") | [S](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S "S") | [T](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T "T") | [U](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U "U") | [V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V "V") | [W](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W "W") | [X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X "X") | [Y](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y "Y") | [Z](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z "Z") |

| Lowercase letter set | a | b | c | d | e | f | g | h | i | j | k | l | m | n | o | p | q | r | s | t | u | v | w | x | y | z |

By the 1960s it became apparent to the [computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer "Computer") and [telecommunications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunication "Telecommunication") industries in the [First World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World "First World") that a non-proprietary method of encoding characters was needed. The [International Organization for Standardization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization "International Organization for Standardization") (ISO) encapsulated the [Latin script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_script "Latin script") in their ([ISO/IEC 646](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_646 "ISO/IEC 646")) 7-bit character-encoding standard. To achieve widespread acceptance, this encapsulation was based on popular usage. The standard was based on the already published _American Standard Code for Information Interchange_, better known as [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII "ASCII"), which included in the [character set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_encoding "Character encoding") the 26 × 2 letters of the [English alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_alphabet "English alphabet"). Later standards issued by the ISO, for example [ISO/IEC 8859](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859 "ISO/IEC 8859") (8-bit character encoding) and [ISO/IEC 10646](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_10646 "ISO/IEC 10646") ([Unicode Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_characters_in_Unicode "Latin characters in Unicode")), have continued to define the 26 × 2 letters of the English alphabet as the basic Latin script with extensions to handle other letters in other languages.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_basic_Latin_alphabet#cite_note-terena-1)

The [Unicode block](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_block "Unicode block") that contains the alphabet is called "[C0 Controls and Basic Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Latin_(Unicode_block) "Basic Latin (Unicode block)")". Two subheadings exist:[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_basic_Latin_alphabet#cite_note-2)

*   "Uppercase Latin alphabet": the letters start at U+0041 and contain the string LATIN CAPITAL LETTER in their descriptions
*   "Lowercase Latin alphabet": the letters start at U+0061 and contain the string LATIN SMALL LETTER in their descriptions

There are also another two sets in the [Halfwidth and Fullwidth Forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halfwidth_and_Fullwidth_Forms "Halfwidth and Fullwidth Forms") block:[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_basic_Latin_alphabet#cite_note-3)

*   Uppercase: the letters start at U+FF21 and contain the string FULLWIDTH LATIN CAPITAL LETTER in their descriptions
*   Lowercase: the letters start at U+FF41 and contain the string FULLWIDTH LATIN SMALL LETTER in their descriptions

*   1972: [ISO 646](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_646 "ISO 646") ([ISO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO "ISO") 7-bit character-encoding standard, using the same alphabetic code values as ASCII, revised in second edition ISO 646:1983 and third edition ISO/IEC 646:1991 as a joint [ISO/IEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC "ISO/IEC") standard)
*   1983: ITU-T Rec. T.51 | [ISO/IEC 6937](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_6937 "ISO/IEC 6937") (a multi-byte extension of ASCII)

    *   Subsequently, other versions and parts of ISO/IEC 8859 have been published.

*   Mid-to-late 1980s: [Windows-1250](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows-1250 "Windows-1250"), [Windows-1252](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows-1252 "Windows-1252"), and other encodings used in [Microsoft Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows "Microsoft Windows") (some roughly similar to ISO/IEC 8859-1)
*   1990: [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode "Unicode") 1.0 (developed by the [Unicode Consortium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_Consortium "Unicode Consortium")),[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_basic_Latin_alphabet#cite_note-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_basic_Latin_alphabet#cite_note-Unicode1.0-7) contained in the block "[C0 Controls and Basic Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C0_Controls_and_Basic_Latin "C0 Controls and Basic Latin")" using the same alphabetic code values as ASCII and ISO/IEC 646 
    *   Subsequently, other versions of Unicode have been published and it later became a joint [ISO/IEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC "ISO/IEC") standard as well, as identified below.

*   1993: [ISO/IEC 10646-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_10646-1 "ISO/IEC 10646-1"):1993, ISO/IEC standard for characters in Unicode 1.1 
    *   Subsequently, other versions of ISO/IEC 10646-1 and one of ISO/IEC 10646-2 have been published. Since 2003, the standards have been published under the name "ISO/IEC 10646" without the separation into two parts.

The uppercase letters of the ISO basic Latin alphabet on a [16-segment display](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16-segment_display "16-segment display") (plus the [Arabic numerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_numerals "Arabic numerals")).

In ASCII the letters belong to the [printable characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#ASCII_printable_characters "ASCII") and in Unicode since version 1.0 they belong to the block "[C0 Controls and Basic Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C0_Controls_and_Basic_Latin "C0 Controls and Basic Latin")". In both cases, as well as in [ISO/IEC 646](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_646 "ISO/IEC 646"), [ISO/IEC 8859](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859 "ISO/IEC 8859") and [ISO/IEC 10646](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_10646 "ISO/IEC 10646") they are occupying the positions in hexadecimal notation 41 to 5A for uppercase and 61 to 7A for lowercase.

Not case sensitive, all letters have code words in the [ICAO spelling alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICAO_spelling_alphabet "ICAO spelling alphabet") and can be represented with [Morse code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code "Morse code").

All of the lowercase letters are used in the [International Phonetic Alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet "International Phonetic Alphabet") (IPA). In [X-SAMPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Speech_Assessment_Methods_Phonetic_Alphabet "Extended Speech Assessment Methods Phonetic Alphabet") and [SAMPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAMPA "SAMPA") these letters have the same sound value as in IPA.

### Alphabets containing the same set of letters

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=ISO_basic_Latin_alphabet&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Alphabets containing the same set of letters")]

The list below only includes alphabets that include all the 26 letters but exclude:

*   letters whose [diacritical marks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritical_marks "Diacritical marks") make them distinct letters.
*   [multigraphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multigraph_(orthography) "Multigraph (orthography)") that constitute distinct letters.
*   [ligatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligature_(writing) "Ligature (writing)") that are distinct letters.

Notable omissions due to these rules include [Spanish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_alphabet "Spanish alphabet"), [Esperanto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto_alphabet "Esperanto alphabet"), [Filipino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abakada_alphabet "Abakada alphabet") and [German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_alphabet "German alphabet"). The German alphabet is sometimes considered by tradition to contain only 26 letters (with ⟨ä⟩, ⟨ö⟩, ⟨ü⟩ considered variants and ⟨ß⟩ considered a ligature of ⟨ſ⟩ ([long s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_s "Long s")) and ⟨s⟩), but the current German orthographic rules include ⟨ä⟩, ⟨ö⟩, ⟨ü⟩, ⟨ß⟩ in the alphabet placed after ⟨Z⟩. In Spanish orthography, the letters ⟨n⟩ and ⟨ñ⟩ are distinct; the [tilde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilde "Tilde") is not considered a diacritic in this case.

English is one of the few modern European languages requiring no diacritics for native words (although a [diaeresis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaeresis_(diacritic) "Diaeresis (diacritic)") is used by some American publishers in words such as "[coöperation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co%C3%B6peration "Coöperation")").[[c]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_basic_Latin_alphabet#cite_note-11)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_basic_Latin_alphabet#cite_note-12)
2.   [Interlingua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interlingua "Interlingua"), a constructed language, never uses diacritics except in unassimilated loanwords. However, they can be removed if they are not used to modify the vowel (e.g. _[cafe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cafe "Cafe")_, from [French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language "French language"): _café_).[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_basic_Latin_alphabet#cite_note-13)
3.   [Latino sine flexione](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latino_sine_flexione "Latino sine flexione"), a.k.a. "Peano's Interlingua", [allows but does not require the placement of an accent for unusual stress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latino_sine_flexione#Stress "Latino sine flexione"). (It antedates the other "Interlingua" by roughly four decades.)
4.   Malay and Indonesian (based on Malay) use all the Latin alphabet and require no diacritics and ligatures. However, Malay and Indonesian learning materials may use ⟨é⟩ (E with acute) to clarify the pronunciation of the letter E; in that case, ⟨e⟩ is pronounced /ə/ while ⟨é⟩ is pronounced /e/ and (è) is pronounced /ɛ/. Many of the [700+ languages of Indonesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_Indonesia "Languages of Indonesia") also use the Indonesian alphabet to write their languages, some—such as [Javanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javanese_script "Javanese script")—adding diacritics é and è, and some omitting q, x, and z.
5.   Xhosa is usually written without diacritics, but may optionally use diacritics over ⟨a, e, i, o, u⟩ for tones: ⟨à, á, â, ä⟩.

The Roman (Latin) alphabet is commonly used for column numbering in a table or chart. This avoids confusion with row numbers using [Arabic numerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_numerals "Arabic numerals"). For example, a 3-by-3 table would contain columns A, B, and C, set against rows 1, 2, and 3. If more columns are needed beyond Z (normally the final letter of the alphabet), the column immediately after Z is AA, followed by AB, and so on[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_basic_Latin_alphabet#cite_note-14) (see [bijective base-26 system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijective_numeration#The_bijective_base-26_system "Bijective numeration")). This can be seen by scrolling far to the right in a spreadsheet program such as [Microsoft Excel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Excel "Microsoft Excel") or [LibreOffice Calc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LibreOffice_Calc "LibreOffice Calc").

The letters are often used for indexing nested bullet points. In this case after the 26th it is more common to use AA, BB, CC, ... instead of base-26 numbers.

1.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_basic_Latin_alphabet#cite_ref-8)**The Italian alphabet is traditionally considered to have only 21 letters, excluding _j_, _k_, _w_, _x_, _y_. However, in practice these letters occur in a number of loanwords. _J_ also occurs in some native Italian proper names as a variant of writing semivocalic _i_.
2.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_basic_Latin_alphabet#cite_ref-10)**Note for Portuguese: _k_ and _y_ (but not _w_) were part of the alphabet until several spelling reforms during the 20th century, the aim of which was to change the etymological Portuguese spelling into an easier phonetic spelling. These letters were replaced by other letters having the same sound: thus _psychologia_ became _psicologia_, _kioske_ became _quiosque_, _martyr_ became _mártir_, etc. Nowadays _k_, _w_, and _y_ are only found in foreign words and their derived terms and in scientific abbreviations (e.g. _km_, _byronismo_). These letters are considered part of the alphabet again following the [1990 Portuguese Language Orthographic Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990_Portuguese_Language_Orthographic_Agreement "1990 Portuguese Language Orthographic Agreement"), which came into effect on January 1, 2009, in Brazil. See [Reforms of Portuguese orthography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reforms_of_Portuguese_orthography "Reforms of Portuguese orthography").
