[ 1 ] History [ edit ] Cosmonaut corps [ edit ] On 7 January 2000, the Kazakh government decreed it would form a cosmonaut corps.

[ 2 ] At that time, two Kazakh cosmonauts had already flown, Toktar Aubakirov in 1991, and Talgat Musabayev (1994, 1998; later 2001).

[ 3 ] Out of 2000 candidates, two were selected, Aidyn Aimbetov and Mukhtar Aymakhanov , in 2002.

[ 4 ] They were sent to Star City for training from 2003 until 2009, when the world financial crisis indefinitely postponed the spaceflight. In 2009, they returned to work in KazCosmos.

[ 5 ] They had originally been projected for a spaceflight in 2005 or 2006.

[ 6 ] Aymakhanov left Kazakhstan in 2012 to become a Russian citizen to pursue a cosmonaut career.

[ 7 ] Aimbetov was still ready for spaceflight in April 2015, and had originally been projected to fly on a 2017 launch.

[ 8 ] In June 2015, he was selected as the replacement for Sarah Brightman on Soyuz TMA-18M / Soyuz TMA-16M , who had declined to fly, and her backup Satoshi Takamatsu also declined. He launched from Baikonur on 2 September 2015, docked with the International Space Station , and returned on 11 September 2015, touching down on the Kazakhstan Steppe, having spent 10 days in space.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] Satellites [ edit ] The year prior to establishment, on 18 June 2006, the communications satellite KazSat-1 was launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome , marking the beginning of Kazakhstan's independent inflight space operations.

[ 11 ] In 2008 communications with the satellite ended, and it was declared lost.

[ 12 ] The next planned satellite, KazSat-2 , experienced a series of delays, but was launched on 16 July 2011 on board a Proton rocket. KazSat-2 was built by Krunichev and Thales Alenia Space Italy.

[ 13 ] KazCosmos signed a contract with ISS-Reshetnev and Thales Alenia Space Italy on 21 June 2011 for the third telecommunications satellite, named KazSat-3 and launched it in 2014.

Operations [ edit ] The head of the agency, Talgat Musabayev , is a veteran of three spaceflights, including two long-duration stays aboard the Russian space station Mir . Musabayev says that the Baikonur Cosmodrome , which is in Kazakhstan, is the main component of the cooperation between the Russian and Kazakh space programs.

[ 11 ] The Russians still heavily use Baikonur for launches.
