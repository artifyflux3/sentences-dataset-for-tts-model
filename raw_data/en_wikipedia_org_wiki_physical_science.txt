It in turn has many branches, each referred to as a "physical science", together is called the "physical sciences".

Definition [ edit ] Physical science can be described as all of the following: A branch of science (a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe ).

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] A branch of natural science – natural science is a major branch of science that tries to explain and predict nature's phenomena, based on empirical evidence . In natural science, hypotheses must be verified scientifically to be regarded as scientific theory.  Validity, accuracy, and social mechanisms ensuring quality control, such as peer review and repeatability of findings, are amongst the criteria and methods used for this purpose. Natural science can be broken into two main branches: life science (for example biology) and physical science. Each of these branches, and all of their sub-branches, are referred to as natural sciences.

A branch of applied science - the application of the scientific method and scientific knowledge to attain practical goals. It includes a broad range of disciplines, such as engineering and medicine ., although medicine would not normally be considered a physical science. Applied science is often contrasted with basic science , which is focused on advancing scientific theories and laws that explain and predict natural or other phenomena.

Branches [ edit ] Physics – natural and physical science could involve the study of matter [ 4 ] and its motion through space and time, along with related concepts such as energy and force.

[ 5 ] More broadly, it is the general analysis of nature, conducted in order to understand how the universe behaves.

[ a ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] Branches of physics Astronomy – study of celestial objects (such as stars, galaxies, planets, moons, asteroids, comets and nebulae), the physics, chemistry, and evolution of such objects, and phenomena that originate outside the atmosphere of Earth, including supernovae explosions, gamma-ray bursts, and cosmic microwave background radiation.

Branches of astronomy Chemistry – studies the composition, structure, properties and change of matter .

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] In this realm, chemistry deals with such topics as the properties of individual atoms, the manner in which atoms form chemical bonds in the formation of compounds, the interactions of substances through intermolecular forces to give matter its general properties, and the interactions between substances through chemical reactions to form different substances.

Branches of chemistry Earth science – all-embracing term referring to the fields of science dealing with planet Earth. Earth science is the study of how the natural environment (ecosphere or Earth system) works and how it evolved to its current state.  It includes the study of the atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere , and biosphere.

Materials science - an interdisciplinary field of researching and discovering materials . Materials scientists emphasize understanding how the history of a material ( processing ) influences its structure, and also the material's properties and performance. The understanding of processing structure properties relationships is called the materials paradigm. This paradigm is used for advanced understanding in a variety of research areas, including nanotechnology , biomaterials , and metallurgy .

Computer science - the study of computation, information, and automation. Computer science spans theoretical disciplines (such as algorithms, theory of computation, and information theory) to applied disciplines (including the design and implementation of hardware and software).

History [ edit ] History of physical science – history of the branch of natural science that studies non-living systems, in contrast to the life sciences . It in turn has many branches, each referred to as a "physical science", together called the "physical sciences". However, the term "physical" creates an unintended, somewhat arbitrary distinction, since many branches of physical science also study biological phenomena (organic chemistry, for example). The four main branches of physical science are astronomy, physics, chemistry, and the Earth sciences, which include meteorology and geology. There are also a number of others which have become important in the twenty-first such as materials science and computer science.

General principles [ edit ] Principle – law or rule that has to be, or usually is to be followed, or can be desirably followed, or is an inevitable consequence of something, such as the laws observed in nature or the way that a system is constructed. The principles of such a system are understood by its users as the essential characteristics of the system, or reflecting system's designed purpose, and the effective operation or use of which would be impossible if any one of the principles was to be ignored.

Basic principles of physics [ edit ] Physics – branch of science that studies matter [ 4 ] and its motion through space and time , along with related concepts such as energy and force .

[ 5 ] Physics is one of the " fundamental sciences " because the other natural sciences (like biology, geology, etc.) deal with systems that seem to obey the laws of physics. According to physics, the physical laws of matter, energy, and the fundamental forces of nature govern the interactions between particles and physical entities (such as planets, molecules, atoms, or subatomic particles). Some of the basic pursuits of physics, which include some of the most prominent developments in modern science in the last millennium, include: Describing the nature, measuring and quantifying of bodies and their motion, dynamics etc.

Newton's laws of motion Mass , force and weight Momentum and conservation of energy Gravity , theories of gravity Energy , work , and their relationship Motion , position, and energy Different forms of Energy, their interconversion and the inevitable loss of energy in the form of heat (Thermodynamics) Energy conservation , conversion , and transfer.

Its studies include the following: The life and characteristics of stars and galaxies Origins of the universe. Physical science uses the Big Bang theory as the commonly accepted scientific theory of the origin of the universe.

A heliocentric Solar System. Ancient cultures saw the Earth as the centre of the Solar System or universe (geocentrism). In the 16th century, Nicolaus Copernicus advanced the ideas of heliocentrism, recognizing the Sun as the centre of the Solar System.

The structure of solar systems , planets , comets , asteroids , and meteors The shape and structure of Earth (roughly spherical, see also Spherical Earth ) Earth in the Solar System Time measurement The composition and features of the Moon Interactions of the Earth and Moon (Note: Astronomy should not be confused with astrology , which assumes [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] that people's destiny and human affairs in general correlate to the apparent positions of astronomical objects in the sky – although the two fields share a common origin, they are quite different; astronomers embrace the scientific method , while astrologers do not.) Basic principles of chemistry [ edit ] Chemistry – branch of science that studies the composition, structure, properties and change of matter .

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] Chemistry is chiefly concerned with atoms and molecules and their interactions and transformations, for example, the properties of the chemical bonds formed between atoms to create chemical compounds . As such, chemistry studies the involvement of electrons and various forms of energy in photochemical reactions , oxidation-reduction reactions , changes in phases of matter , and separation of mixtures . Preparation and properties of complex substances, such as alloys , polymers , biological molecules, and pharmaceutical agents are considered in specialized fields of chemistry.
