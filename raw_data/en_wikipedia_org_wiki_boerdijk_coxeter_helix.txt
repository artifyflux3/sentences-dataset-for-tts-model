A Boerdijk helical sphere packing has each sphere centered at a vertex of the Coxeter helix. Each sphere is in contact with 6 neighboring spheres.

The Boerdijk–Coxeter helix , named after H. S. M. Coxeter and Arie Hendrick Boerdijk [ es ] , is a linear stacking of regular tetrahedra , arranged so that the edges of the complex that belong to only one tetrahedron form three intertwined helices . There are two chiral forms, with either right-handed or left-handed windings. Unlike any other stacking of Platonic solids , the Boerdijk–Coxeter helix is not rotationally repetitive in 3-dimensional space. Even in an infinite string of stacked tetrahedra, no two tetrahedra will have the same orientation, because the helical pitch per cell is not a rational fraction of the circle. However, modified forms of this helix have been found which are rotationally repetitive, [ 2 ] and in 4-dimensional space this helix repeats in rings of exactly 30 tetrahedral cells that tessellate the 3-sphere surface of the 600-cell , one of the six regular convex polychora .

Buckminster Fuller named it a tetrahelix and considered them with regular and irregular tetrahedral elements.

[ 3 ] Geometry [ edit ] The coordinates of vertices of Boerdijk–Coxeter helix composed of tetrahedra with unit edge length can be written in the form ( r cos ⁡ ⁡ n θ θ , r sin ⁡ ⁡ n θ θ , n h ) {\displaystyle (r\cos n\theta ,r\sin n\theta ,nh)} where r = 3 3 / 10 {\displaystyle r=3{\sqrt {3}}/10} , θ θ = ± ± cos − − 1 ⁡ ⁡ ( − − 2 / 3 ) ≈ ≈ 131.81 ∘ ∘ {\displaystyle \theta =\pm \cos ^{-1}(-2/3)\approx 131.81^{\circ }} , h = 1 / 10 {\displaystyle h=1/{\sqrt {10}}} and n {\displaystyle n} is an arbitrary integer. The two different values of θ θ {\displaystyle \theta } correspond to the two chiral forms. All vertices are located on the cylinder with radius r {\displaystyle r} along z-axis. Given how the tetrahedra alternate, this gives an apparent twist of 2 θ θ − − 4 3 π π ≈ ≈ 23.62 ∘ ∘ {\displaystyle 2\theta -{\frac {4}{3}}\pi \approx 23.62^{\circ }} every two tetrahedra. There is another inscribed cylinder with radius 1 / 6 {\displaystyle 1/{\sqrt {6}}} inside the helix.

[ 4 ] Higher-dimensional geometry [ edit ] The 600-cell partitions into 20 rings of 30 tetrahedra , each a Boerdijk–Coxeter helix.

[ 5 ] When superimposed onto the 3-sphere curvature it becomes periodic, with a period of ten vertices, encompassing all 30 cells. The collective of such helices in the 600-cell represent a discrete Hopf fibration .

[ 6 ] [ failed verification ] While in 3 dimensions the edges are helices, in the imposed 3-sphere topology they are geodesics and have no torsion . They spiral around each other naturally due to the Hopf fibration.

[ 7 ] [ failed verification ] The collective of edges forms another discrete Hopf fibration of 12 rings with 10 vertices each. These correspond to rings of 10 dodecahedrons in the dual 120-cell .

In addition, the 16-cell partitions into two 8-tetrahedron rings , four edges long, [ citation needed ] and the 5-cell partitions into a single degenerate 5-tetrahedron ring .

This helix exists as finite ring of 30 pyramids in a 4-dimensional polytope .

And equilateral pentagonal pyramids can be chained with 3 vertex configurations, 3.3.5, 3.5.3.5, and 3.3.3.5.3.3.5: In architecture [ edit ] The Art Tower Mito is based on a Boerdijk–Coxeter helix.
