[ 19 ] [ 20 ] Devas shares were sold at a premium of ₹ 1,226,000 (US$15,000), taking the accumulated share premium to ₹ 5.78 billion (US$68 million), thus getting a high profit.

[ 19 ] [ 21 ] In late 2009, some ISRO insiders exposed information about the Devas-Antrix deal, [ 20 ] [ 22 ] and the ensuing investigations resulted in the deal being annulled.

G. Madhavan Nair (ISRO Chairperson when the agreement was signed) was barred from holding any post under the Department of Space. Some former scientists were found guilty of "acts of commission" or "acts of omission". Devas and Deutsche Telekom demanded US$2 billion and US$1 billion, respectively, in damages.

[ 23 ] The Central Bureau of Investigation concluded investigations into the Antrix-Devas scam and registered a case against the accused in the Antrix-Devas deal under Section 120-B, besides Section 420 of IPC and Section 13(2) read with 13(1)(d) of PC Act, 1988 on 18 March 2015 against the then executive director, Antrix Corporation Limited, Bengaluru; two officials of USA-based company; Bengaluru based private multi media company and other unknown officials of Antrix Corporation Limited /ISRO/Department of Space.
