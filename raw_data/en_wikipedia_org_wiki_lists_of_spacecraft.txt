The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to space exploration.

Space exploration – use of astronomy and space technology to explore outer space .

[ 1 ] Physical exploration of space is conducted both by human spaceflights and by robotic spacecraft .

Essence of space exploration [ edit ] Space exploration Big science – Term used to describe a series of changes in science occurred in industrial nations Exploration – Process of investigating unfamiliar things High tech – Most advanced technology available Space – Void between celestial bodies Spaceflight – Flight into or through outer space Branches of space exploration [ edit ] Human spaceflight – Spaceflight with a crew or passengers Uncrewed spaceflight – Autonomous space travel without human History of space exploration [ edit ] Main articles: History of space exploration and
