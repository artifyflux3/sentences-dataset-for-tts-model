[ 4 ] Surrounded by rolling hills, it lies in the state's Southern Tier region near the Pennsylvania border, in a bowl-shaped valley at the confluence of the Susquehanna and Chenango rivers.

[ 5 ] The population was 47,969 at the 2020 census .

[ 6 ] Binghamton is the principal city of the Binghamton metropolitan area (also known as Greater Binghamton, or historically the Triple Cities, including Endicott and Johnson City), home to a quarter million people.

[ 7 ] From the days of the railroad , Binghamton was a transportation crossroads and a manufacturing center, and has been known at different times for the production of cigars, shoes, and computers.

[ 8 ] IBM was founded nearby, and the flight simulator was invented in the city, leading to a notable concentration of electronics- and defense-oriented firms. This sustained economic prosperity earned Binghamton the moniker of the Valley of Opportunity .

[ 9 ] However, starting with job cuts made by defense firms towards the end of the Cold War , the region lost a large part of its manufacturing industry.

[ 10 ] Today, while there is a continued concentration of high-tech firms, Binghamton is emerging as a healthcare- and education-focused city, with Binghamton University acting as much of the driving force behind this revitalization.

[ 11 ] History [ edit ] Former DL&W Station, part of the Railroad Terminal Historic District Early settlement [ edit ] The first known people of European descent to come to the area were the troops of the Sullivan Expedition in 1779, during the American Revolutionary War , who destroyed local villages of the Onondaga and Oneida tribes.

[ 9 ] The city was named after William Bingham , a wealthy Philadelphian who bought the 10,000 acre patent for the land in 1786, then consisting of parts of the towns of Union and Chenango .

[ 9 ] [ 12 ] Joshua Whitney, Jr., Bingham's land agent, chose land at the junction of the Chenango and Susquehanna Rivers to develop a settlement, then named Chenango Point .

[ 9 ] [ 13 ] After being officially conveyed the land by Bingham on July 4, 1800, Whitney arranged for the construction of the settlement's first two streets, Court Street and Water Street, and the first residence was built later that year.

[ 14 ] [ 15 ] Whitney continued to expand Chenango Point and sell plots to new settlers, and helped erect the first bridge in 1808.

[ 9 ] The significant growth of Chenango Point led to its incorporation as a village , and its official renaming as Binghamton, in 1834.

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] Daniel S. Dickinson was chosen to be the first village president.

[ 9 ] Perspective map of Binghamton from 1882 published by L.R. Burleigh The Chenango Canal , completed in 1837, connected Binghamton to the Erie Canal , and was the impetus for the initial industrial development of the area.

[ 16 ] This growth accelerated with the completion of the Erie Railroad between Binghamton and Jersey City, NJ in 1849.

[ 17 ] With the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad arriving soon afterward, the village became an important regional transportation center.

[ 9 ] [ 18 ] Several buildings of importance were built at this time, including the New York State Inebriate Asylum , opened in 1858 as the first center in the United States to treat alcoholism as a disease.

[ 19 ] Growth as a manufacturing hub [ edit ] Binghamton incorporated as a city in 1867 and, due to the presence of several stately homes, was nicknamed the Parlor City .

[ 8 ] In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many immigrants moved to the area, finding an abundance of jobs. During the 1880s, Binghamton became the second-largest manufacturer of cigars in the United States.

[ 9 ] By the early 1920s, Endicott Johnson , a shoe manufacturer whose development of welfare capitalism resulted in many amenities for local residents, became the region's largest employer.

[ 20 ] An even larger influx of Europeans immigrated to Binghamton, and the working class prosperity resulted in the area being called the Valley of Opportunity.

[ 9 ] [ 20 ] Court Street , c. 1910 In 1913, 31 people perished in the Binghamton Clothing Company fire , which resulted in reforms to the New York fire code.

[ 21 ] [ 22 ] Major floods in 1935 and 1936 resulted in a number of deaths and washed out the Ferry Street Bridge (now the Clinton Street Bridge). The floods led the city to build flood walls along the length of the Susquehanna and Chenango Rivers.

[ 9 ] [ 23 ] During the Second World War , growth continued as IBM , which was founded in greater Binghamton, emerged as a global technology leader.

[ 24 ] Along with Edwin Link 's invention of the flight simulator in Binghamton, IBM's growth helped transition the region to a high-tech economy. Other major manufacturers included Ansco and General Electric .

[ 8 ] Until the Cold War ended, the area never experienced an economic downfall, due in part to its defense-oriented industries.

[ 9 ] The city's population peaked at around 85,000 in the mid-1950s.

[ 25 ] Decline and recovery [ edit ] Flooding in 2011 due to the remnants of Tropical Storm Lee Post-war suburban development led to a decline in the city's population and the rapid growth of the towns of Vestal and Union .

[ 9 ] Like many other Rust Belt cities, traditional manufacturers saw steep declines, though Binghamton's technology industry limited this impact.

Urban renewal efforts to reverse these trends dominated construction in the city during the 1960s and early 1970s and led to the destruction of many ornate city buildings.

[ 9 ] The construction included the creation of Government Plaza , the Broome County Veterans Memorial Arena , and the Brandywine Highway .

[ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] While these projects failed to stem most of the losses, they established Binghamton as the region's government and cultural center.

[ 9 ] The city's population declined from approximately 64,000 in 1969 to 56,000 by the early 1980s.

[ 29 ] As the Cold War ended in 1991 with the collapse of the Soviet Union, defense-related industries in the Binghamton area began to falter, resulting in several closures and widespread layoffs [ 1 ] These were most notable at IBM, which sold its Federal Systems division and laid off several thousands of workers.

[ 10 ] The local economy went into a deep recession, and the long-prevalent manufacturing jobs dropped by 64% from 1990 to 2013.

[ 30 ] In the 21st century, the city has tried to diversify its economic base to spur revitalization. The local economy has slowly transitioned toward services and healthcare.

[ 11 ] Major emphasis has been placed on Binghamton University , which built a downtown campus in 2007 [ 31 ] and several student housing complexes.

[ 32 ] The increased downtown residential population and the university's plans to build additional student housing have spurred development of supporting businesses and a renewed focus on the riverfront.

[ 33 ] Unfortunately, two severe floods have stymied the recovery: while most of the impact of the Mid-Atlantic United States flood of 2006 was in the surrounding metropolitan area, the remnants of Tropical Storm Lee topped city flood walls in September 2011, causing $1 billion of damage in greater Binghamton.

[ 34 ] On April 3, 2009, the deadliest mass shooting in New York history occurred at the American Civic Association 's offices in Binghamton.

[ 35 ] Geography [ edit ] Cityscape [ edit ] Confluence Park, facing west toward the confluence of the Susquehanna (left) and Chenango (right) rivers According to the U.S. Census Bureau , the city has an area of 11.14 square miles (28.9 km 2 ), of which 10.49 square miles (27.2 km 2 ) is land and 0.65 square miles (1.7 km 2 ) (5.83%) is water.

[ 7 ] Binghamton, like all of the Southern Tier of New York, lies on the Allegheny Plateau ; hence its hilly terrain. As such, elevations can vary in the city-- Downtown , for example, is at an elevation of around 860 feet (262 meters), while residential homes in the hills can go up to over 1,800 feet (548 meters), such as on Ingram Hill. The highest peak in Binghamton is Table Rock Ridge, which is at 1,854 feet.

[ 36 ] The Downtown area sits at the confluence of the Chenango and Susquehanna Rivers, in the middle of a long but relatively narrow valley.

[ 5 ] The north branch of the Susquehanna River passes south of downtown. This branch rises in eastern New York and receives a number of tributaries above Binghamton. In the center of the city, the Chenango River feeds into the Susquehanna from the north at Confluence Park. The Binghamton River Trail, a 1.5 mile trail along the Chenango, runs between Cheri Lindsey Park on the Northside and Confluence Park in Downtown.

[ 37 ] Eleven bridges span the rivers inside city limits. Broome County has 17.5 miles of levees , many of which are in Binghamton.

[ 38 ] Major floods have occurred in 1865, 1935, 1936, 2006 , and 2011 .

[ 9 ] [ 39 ] [ 40 ] The incorporation of Binghamton united various communities on both shores of the two rivers. The majority of the city's population and development lies along the rolling terrain nearest the riverbanks with sparse development in the hills that define the city limits. The old city was laid out on a grid system by Joshua Whitney, Jr., [ 9 ] but as development spread to the outer regions of the city and merged with other settlements, several grids were eventually juxtaposed against each other. In the Southside, the grid breaks down, as more curvilinear roads make up the predominantly residential areas along the hills.

The Beaux-Arts Security Mutual Life Building (1905) The city was the traditional economic center of the region and is home to several historic districts. The Railroad Terminal Historic District consists of several factories and buildings along the railroad line in the northern limits of downtown.

[ 41 ] Over 1,000 properties on the West Side contribute to the Abel Bennett Tract Historic District , mainly made up of residential properties along Riverside Drive.

[ 42 ] Downtown's State Street-Henry Street Historic District consists of several older low-rise buildings.

[ 43 ] The Court Street Historic District has some of the city's most notable architecture, including the Press Building and Security Mutual Building, early 20th century high rises, and the Broome County Courthouse .

[ 44 ] The Press Building was the tallest building in Binghamton until the completion of the State Office Building in Government Plaza , which remains the tallest in the city.

[ 45 ] Away from downtown, most of the buildings are single- and multi-family dwellings, along with low-rise business buildings lining commercial arteries. Along the railroad corridors, several factories, mostly abandoned, rise above the otherwise-uniform landscape.

Main Street runs through the West Side, and continues west to serve as Main Street in the villages of Johnson City and Endicott . On the east side of the Chenango River, the road becomes Court Street , the major east–west artery in downtown and the East Side.

Neighborhoods [ edit ] Roberson Mansion North Side, along Chenango Street Binghamton is divided into seven neighborhoods.

[ 46 ] [ 47 ] [ 48 ] Downtown Binghamton , also known as Center City, is home to most of the city's largest buildings and government services. Located at the northeast corner of the river confluence and increasingly populated by college students, it supports a flourishing arts scene.

[ 33 ] [ 49 ] The North Side is across the Norfolk Southern rail tracks from downtown, along the Chenango River.

[ 50 ] The North Side is a light commercial and working-class residential area of the city, with Chenango Street serving as its major artery. The East Side lies east of the Brandywine Highway , along the north bank of the Susquehanna River. The neighborhood is largely residential with commercial corridors along Robinson and Court streets, and it has pockets of industrial development along its borders.

Across the Chenango River lies the West Side , a primarily residential neighborhood along the banks of the Susquehanna that has a combination of family homes, student housing, and stately mansions. Main Street's large supermarkets, pharmacies, bank branches, pubs, restaurants, auto shops, and a few strip malls form the West Side's commercial corridor.

[ 51 ] The First Ward , a largely residential neighborhood opposite the railroad tracks from the West Side, is best known for Antique Row, a series of antique shops that line Clinton Street. This part of the city is home to several gold-domed Christian churches built by the area's many Eastern European immigrants.

[ 52 ] It is also home to several large supermarkets, churches, pharmacies, bank branches, a few bars and restaurants as well as mom and pop shops that provide such goods as video games and music. Ely Park, Binghamton's northernmost neighborhood, contains its municipal golf course.

[ 53 ] It lies on parts of Prospect Mountain and other hills north of the First Ward.

The Southside lies along the south bank of the Susquehanna River and is connected to downtown by several bridges. At the base of the historic South Washington Street Bridge is the Southbridge commercial district.

[ 54 ] The neighborhood is partitioned into two neighborhood assemblies, divided by Pennsylvania Avenue and Southbridge, due to their distinct characters.

[ 46 ] Southside East has working-class residences and some public housing projects and is home to the Islamic Awareness Center , while Southside West is primarily made up of larger middle-class residences.

[ 56 ] Summers in Binghamton are typified by warm yet temperate days, and there are an average of only 2.6 days annually where the high exceeds 90 °F (32 °C), with the highest recorded temperature at 98 °F (37 °C) on July 16, 1988.

[ 55 ] Winters are somewhat less moderate, with 5.8 days with sub-0 °F (−18 °C) lows annually on average; the lowest recorded temperature was −20 °F (−29 °C) on January 15, 1957.

[ 55 ] As with most cities in upstate New York, precipitation in Binghamton is spread evenly throughout the year.

[ 56 ] [ 55 ] Binghamton is the 10th rainiest city in the United States, with 162 rainy days a year.

[ 57 ] With 212 cloudy days annually, it is also the seventh cloudiest city in the country, and the cloudiest east of the Rocky Mountains .

[ 58 ] Binghamton's proximity to the Great Lakes results in significant cloudiness and precipitation. Weather systems traveling over the lake pick up significant moisture, and cooler air masses from the west and the north culminate in a continuously unsettled weather pattern.

[ 57 ] [ 59 ] [ 60 ] Snowfall is significant, with an annual total of 84.4 inches (214 cm). Binghamton is not as greatly affected by lake-effect snow as cities further north or west such as Syracuse and Buffalo , which are part of the Great Lakes snowbelt .

[ 61 ] However, persistent snow bands from both the Great Lakes and the Finger Lakes occasionally result in moderate snows.

[ 60 ] Binghamton receives occasional major snowfall from nor'easter storms as well (such as the 1993 Storm of the Century , or nearly four feet of snow in December 2020 [ 62 ] ), and competes for the Golden Snowball Award with other upstate cities.

As of the census [ 7 ] of 2010 , 47,376 people, 21,150 households, and 9,986 families resided in the city. The population density was 4,516.8 inhabitants per square mile (1,743.9/km 2 ). There were 23,842 housing units at an average density of 2,273.1 per square mile (877.6/km 2 ). Of all households, 20.8% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 26.9% were married couples living together, 15.6% had a female householder with no husband present, 4.7% had a male householder with no wife present, and 52.8% were non-families. 40.5% of all households were made up of individuals, and 25.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.18 and the average family size was 2.94.

Race and ethnicity [ edit ] Binghamton is home to an ethnically diverse population. During its industrial heyday, thousands of European immigrants moved to the city as they found an abundance of jobs and working-class prosperity. Many Irish, Italians, and Eastern Europeans settled in the area, and the American Civic Association was created to help their transition to life and assimilation in the United States.

[ 9 ] [ 52 ] This influx led to a temporary rise in the local Ku Klux Klan during the 1920s, with Binghamton serving as state headquarters. Area residents, who primarily embraced the different cultural heritages, quelled such anti-immigrant sentiment by founding several ethnic organizations and holding ethnic celebrations, at the encouragement of Endicott-Johnson .

[ 20 ] [ 67 ] This has had a lasting effect on the city, which sports many churches and contemporary ethnic festivals, along with a population that is still predominantly white (though steadily decreasing in proportion). Binghamton also has a sizeable Kurdish community.

[ 68 ] As of 2010, Binghamton's racial makeup was 77.6% White , 11.4% Black or African American , 0.3% Native American , 4.2% Asian , 0.04% Pacific Islander , 2.0% from other races , and 4.4% from two or more races. 6.4% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.

Due to its diversity, the region is home to many religious denominations. The First Ward, the historic home to much of the city's Eastern European population, houses several gold domed Orthodox churches.

The former Binghamton Mets have sent stars like Daniel Murphy , Noah Syndergaard , Steven Matz , Juan Lagares , José Reyes , David Wright , Preston Wilson , Ike Davis , Zack Wheeler , Edgardo Alfonzo , Jon Niese , Pete Alonso and Jay Payton to the majors.

Binghamton has a long history in professional baseball dating back to 1877. Teams nicknamed the Crickets, the Bingoes, and for many years the Triplets represented Binghamton in the New York State League (now defunct), the New York–Pennsylvania League , the International League , and the Eastern League (1892–94, 1938–1963, 1967–1968, 1992–2021).

The 1887 Binghamton Bingoes of the International League attracted national attention when the white players revolted against the two black players on the team. The reaction around the league forced Binghamton to release the black players, and the team folded soon after.

The Binghamton Triplets of the Eastern League, founded in 1923, became a farm club of the New York Yankees in 1932, and sent many players to New York through 1968, when the team folded. Notably, the Hall of Fame pitcher Whitey Ford was a starting pitcher for the Triplets in 1949.

Football [ edit ] Binghamton has also been home to two semiprofessional football teams, the Broome County Dragons (members of the Empire Football League) and the Southern Tier Green Machine (members of the North American Football League).

Golf [ edit ] The B.C. Open was an official PGA Tour event held annually from 1971 to 2005 at Endicott's En-Joie Golf Course. (Note that the 2006 B.C.

Hockey [ edit ] Professional hockey arrived in Binghamton in 1973 with the founding of the Broome Dusters of the North American Hockey League . The Dusters were known for their wide-open style of play, which was unusual in professional hockey at the time. While crowds were sparse at the beginning of the 1973 season, the team's popularity grew and the strength of the Dusters fan base, combined with continuous sellouts, led The Hockey News to declare Binghamton as Hockey Town USA .

[ 126 ] When the league folded in 1977, the Providence team of the American Hockey League moved to Binghamton and became the Binghamton Dusters . The team became the Binghamton Whalers from 1980 to 1990 and the Binghamton Rangers from 1990 to 1997 as a result of affiliations with the National Hockey League 's (NHL) Hartford Whalers and New York Rangers .

Later the Binghamton Senators who were the AHL affiliate of the Ottawa Senators were formed. The B-Sens won division titles in 2003 and 2005, reached the AHL conference finals in 2003 and won the Calder Cup in 2011. The B-Sens sent players such as Jason Spezza , Robin Lehner , Chris Kelly , Jakob Silfverberg , and Jean-Gabriel Pageau to the NHL. The B-Sens relocated to Canada for the 2017–18 season.

When the Senators were relocated, the NHL's New Jersey Devils brought their AHL franchise to the city as the Binghamton Devils with home games at Floyd L. Maines Veterans Memorial Arena . The B-Devils left Binghamton in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic and then relocated as the Utica Comets in 2021.

An expansion team in the Federal Prospects Hockey League (FPHL) called the Binghamton Black Bears replaced the Devils at the Veterans Memorial Arena starting with the 2021–22 season. In May 2024, the Binghamton Black Bears won the Commissioner's Cup, sweeping the Carolina Thunderbirds 3-0 in the best-of-five FPHL Finals.

[ 127 ] Tennis [ edit ] The area was home to an annual Professional Tennis Challenger, the Levene Gouldin & Thompson Tennis Challenger , part of the USTA pro circuit (Known as the Frito-Lay Tennis Challenger in years past) and ATP Challenger Tour , from 1994 to 2019.
