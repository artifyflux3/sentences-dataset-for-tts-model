In astrophysics , the Bondi accretion , named after Hermann Bondi , is spherical accretion onto a compact object traveling through the interstellar medium . It is generally used in the context of neutron star and black hole accretion. To achieve an approximate form of the Bondi accretion rate, accretion is assumed to occur at a rate M ˙ ˙ ≃ ≃ π π R 2 ρ ρ v {\displaystyle {\dot {M}}\simeq \pi R^{2}\rho v} .

where: ρ ρ {\displaystyle \rho } is the ambient density v {\displaystyle v} is the object's velocity v o {\displaystyle v_{o}} or the sound speed c s {\displaystyle c_{s}} in the surrounding medium if v o < c s {\displaystyle v_{o}<c_{s}} R {\displaystyle R} is the Bondi radius, defined as 2 G M / c s 2 {\displaystyle 2GM/c_{s}^{2}} .

The Bondi radius comes from setting escape velocity equal to the sound speed and solving for radius. It represents the boundary between subsonic and supersonic infall.

[ 1 ] Substituting the Bondi radius in the above equation yields: M ˙ ˙ ≃ ≃ π π ρ ρ G 2 M 2 c s 3 {\displaystyle {\dot {M}}\simeq {\frac {\pi \rho G^{2}M^{2}}{c_{s}^{3}}}} .

These are only scaling relations rather than rigorous definitions. A more complete solution can be found in Bondi's original work and two other papers.

Application to accreting protoplanets [ edit ] When a planet is forming in a protoplanetary disk, it needs the gas in the disk to fall into its Bondi sphere in order for the planet to be able to accrete an atmosphere. For a massive enough planet, the initial accreted gas can quickly fill up the Bondi sphere. At this point, the atmosphere must cool and contract (through the Kelvin–Helmholtz mechanism ) for the planet to be able to accrete more of an atmosphere.
