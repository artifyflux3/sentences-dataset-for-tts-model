The nodal period (or draconic period ) of a satellite is the time interval between successive passages of the satellite through either of its orbital nodes , [ 1 ] [ 2 ] typically the ascending node. This type of orbital period applies to artificial satellites, like those that monitor weather on Earth , and natural satellites like the Moon .

It is distinct from the sidereal period , which measures the period with respect to reference stars seemingly fixed onto a spherical background , since the location of a satellite's nodes precess over time.

[ 3 ] For example, the nodal period of the Moon is 27.2122 days [ 4 ] (one draconic month ), while its sidereal period is 27.3217 days [ 5 ] (one sidereal month ).

Near-Earth satellites [ edit ] The oblate figure of the Earth has important effects of the orbits of near-Earth satellites.

[ 6 ] An expression for the nodal period ( T n ) of a near circular orbit, such that the eccentricity ( ε ) is almost but not equal to zero, is the following: [ 7 ] T n = 2 π π a 3 2 μ μ 1 2 ( 1 − − 3 J 2 ( 4 − − 5 sin 2 ⁡ ⁡ i ) 4 ( a R ) 2 1 − − ε ε 2 ( 1 + ε ε cos ⁡ ⁡ ω ω ) 2 − − 3 J 2 ( 1 + ε ε cos ⁡ ⁡ ω ω ) 3 2 ( a R ) 2 ( 1 − − ε ε 2 ) 3 ) {\displaystyle T_{n}={\frac {2\pi a^{\frac {3}{2}}}{\mu ^{\frac {1}{2}}}}\left(1-{\frac {3J_{2}\left(4-5\sin ^{2}i\right)}{4\left({\frac {a}{R}}\right)^{2}{\sqrt {1-\varepsilon ^{2}}}\left(1+\varepsilon \cos \omega \right)^{2}}}-{\frac {3J_{2}\left(1+\varepsilon \cos \omega \right)^{3}}{2\left({\frac {a}{R}}\right)^{2}\left(1-\varepsilon ^{2}\right)^{3}}}\right)} where a {\displaystyle a} is the semi-major axis , μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } is the gravitational constant, J 2 {\displaystyle J_{2}} is a perturbation factor due to the oblateness of the earth, i {\displaystyle i} is the inclination , R {\displaystyle R} is the radius of the earth and ω ω {\displaystyle \omega } is the argument of the perigee .
