It criticizes how the term " brain drain " often overlooks these women while discussing human capital flight , which typically focuses on professionals leaving their home countries. Conversely, " care gain " refers to the benefits for women migrant workers, their families, and the receiving nations.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Care drain is notable in five migratory streams: [ 3 ] From Eastern Europe to Western Europe From Mexico, Central America, and South America to the United States From North Africa to Southern Europe From South Asia to the Gulf states From the Philippines to all over the world—Hong Kong, the US, Europe, and Israel See also [ edit ] Global care chain References [ edit ] ^ Cooray, Devoushi (2017-06-02).
