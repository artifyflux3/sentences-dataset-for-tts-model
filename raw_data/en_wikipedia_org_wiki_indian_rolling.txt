Social model of disability Social privilege Christian male white Social stigma Speciesism Stereotype The talk v t e Indian rolling (or Injun rollin' ) [ 1 ] [ 2 ] is the assault, and in some cases murder, of often homeless [ 3 ] Navajo and Apache individuals committed by non-Indians in the Southwestern United States , especially in the border towns surrounding the Navajo Nation and Jicarilla lands .
In her 2006 dissertation, Lisa Donaldson classifies Indian rolling as a "thrill-seeking hate crime" and traces its roots to the colonization of the Southwest which created a "power differential between groups that led to negative feelings toward minorities among law enforcement and local citizens".

[ 2 ] The assaults, which often target comparatively defenseless alcoholic men, are variously described as  "rites of passage", [ 1 ] "sport", [ 4 ] and a "recreational pastime" [ 2 ] to the perpetrators. 
Survivors report the act involves being assaulted with rocks, pellet guns , bottles, eggs, and baseball bats. Victims claim, furthermore, that law enforcement officials often refuse to intervene.

[ 5 ] The term first came to public notoriety in the spring of 1974 when three Navajos were beaten and murdered [ 4 ] by white teenagers in the city of Farmington, New Mexico , and their mutilated bodies were subsequently found in a nearby canyon.

[ 1 ] The perpetrators were not convicted of murder but were sent to a reform school . Subsequent protests by tribal members turned into riots when permits to march peacefully were revoked or not granted.

[ 6 ] The incident triggered a report by the New Mexico Advisory Committee to the United States Commission on Civil Rights and inspired the true crime -novel The Broken Circle—A True Story of Murder and Magic in Indian Country by Rodney Barker.

[ 5 ] [ 7 ] Concerns about the practice's revival emerged in the 1970s to 2000s after a resurgence of attacks against Native Americans in the area.

[ 1 ] [ 8 ] Assaults have allegedly taken place in the Arizona cities of Flagstaff , Phoenix , and Page and in Gallup , New Mexico.
