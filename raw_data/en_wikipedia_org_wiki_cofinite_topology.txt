In mathematics , a cofinite subset of a set X {\displaystyle X} is a subset A {\displaystyle A} whose complement in X {\displaystyle X} is a finite set . In other words, A {\displaystyle A} contains all but finitely many elements of X .

{\displaystyle X.} If the complement is not finite, but is countable, then one says the set is cocountable .

These arise naturally when generalizing structures on finite sets to infinite sets, particularly on infinite products, as in the product topology or direct sum .

This use of the prefix " co " to describe a property possessed by a set's co mplement is consistent with its use in other terms such as " co meagre set ".

Boolean algebras [ edit ] The set of all subsets of X {\displaystyle X} that are either finite or cofinite forms a Boolean algebra , which means that it is closed under the operations of union , intersection , and complementation. This Boolean algebra is the finite–cofinite algebra on X .

{\displaystyle X.} In the other direction, a Boolean algebra A {\displaystyle A} has a unique non-principal ultrafilter (that is, a maximal filter not generated by a single element of the algebra) if and only if there exists an infinite set X {\displaystyle X} such that A {\displaystyle A} is isomorphic to the finite–cofinite algebra on X .

{\displaystyle X.} In this case, the non-principal ultrafilter is the set of all cofinite subsets of X {\displaystyle X} .

Cofinite topology [ edit ] The cofinite topology or the finite complement topology is a topology that can be defined on every set X .

{\displaystyle X.} It has precisely the empty set and all cofinite subsets of X {\displaystyle X} as open sets. As a consequence, in the cofinite topology, the only closed subsets are finite sets, or the whole of X .

{\displaystyle X.} For this reason, the cofinite topology is also known as the finite-closed topology . Symbolically, one writes the topology as T = { A ⊆ ⊆ X : A = ∅ ∅ or X ∖ ∖ A is finite } .

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {T}}=\{A\subseteq X:A=\varnothing {\mbox{ or }}X\setminus A{\mbox{ is finite}}\}.} This topology occurs naturally in the context of the Zariski topology . Since polynomials in one variable over a field K {\displaystyle K} are zero on finite sets, or the whole of K , {\displaystyle K,} the Zariski topology on K {\displaystyle K} (considered as affine line ) is the cofinite topology. The same is true for any irreducible algebraic curve ; it is not true, for example, for X Y = 0 {\displaystyle XY=0} in the plane.

Properties [ edit ] Subspaces: Every subspace topology of the cofinite topology is also a cofinite topology.

Compactness: Since every open set contains all but finitely many points of X , {\displaystyle X,} the space X {\displaystyle X} is compact and sequentially compact .

Separation:  The cofinite topology is the coarsest topology satisfying the T 1 axiom ; that is, it is the smallest topology for which every singleton set is closed. In fact, an arbitrary topology on X {\displaystyle X} satisfies the T 1 axiom if and only if it contains the cofinite topology. If X {\displaystyle X} is finite then the cofinite topology is simply the discrete topology . If X {\displaystyle X} is not finite then this topology is not Hausdorff (T 2 ) , regular or normal because no two nonempty open sets are disjoint (that is, it is hyperconnected ).

Double-pointed cofinite topology [ edit ] The double-pointed cofinite topology is the cofinite topology with every point doubled; that is, it is the topological product of the cofinite topology with the indiscrete topology on a two-element set.  It is not T 0 or T 1 , since the points of each doublet are topologically indistinguishable .  It is, however, R 0 since topologically distinguishable points are separated .  The space is compact as the product of two compact spaces; alternatively, it is compact because each nonempty open set contains all but finitely many points.

For an example of the countable double-pointed cofinite topology, the set Z {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} } of integers can be given a topology such that every even number 2 n {\displaystyle 2n} is topologically indistinguishable from the following odd number 2 n + 1 {\displaystyle 2n+1} .  The closed sets are the unions of finitely many pairs 2 n , 2 n + 1 , {\displaystyle 2n,2n+1,} or the whole set.  The open sets are the complements of the closed sets; namely, each open set consists of all but a finite number of pairs 2 n , 2 n + 1 , {\displaystyle 2n,2n+1,} or is the empty set.

Other examples [ edit ] Product topology [ edit ] The product topology on a product of topological spaces ∏ ∏ X i {\displaystyle \prod X_{i}} has basis ∏ ∏ U i {\displaystyle \prod U_{i}} where U i ⊆ ⊆ X i {\displaystyle U_{i}\subseteq X_{i}} is open, and cofinitely many U i = X i .

{\displaystyle U_{i}=X_{i}.} The analog without requiring that cofinitely many factors are the whole space is the box topology .

Direct sum [ edit ] The elements of the direct sum of modules ⨁ ⨁ M i {\displaystyle \bigoplus M_{i}} are sequences α α i ∈ ∈ M i {\displaystyle \alpha _{i}\in M_{i}} where cofinitely many α α i = 0.

{\displaystyle \alpha _{i}=0.} The analog without requiring that cofinitely many summands are zero is the direct product .
