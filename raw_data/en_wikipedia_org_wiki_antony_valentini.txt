[ 1 ] Education and career [ edit ] Valentini obtained an undergraduate degree from Cambridge University , then earned his Ph.D. in 1992 [ 2 ] with Dennis Sciama at the International School for Advanced Studies (ISAS-SISSA) in Trieste , Italy.

[ 1 ] [ 3 ] In 1999, after seven years in Italy, he took up a post-doc grant to work at the Imperial College with Lee Smolin and Christopher Isham .

[ 1 ] He worked at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics . In February 2011, he became professor of physics and astronomy at Clemson University; as of 2022, he was listed as adjunct faculty.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] Together with Mike Towler , Royal Society research fellow of the University of Cambridge's Cavendish Laboratory , he organized a conference on the de Broglie-Bohm theory the Apuan Alps Centre for Physics in August 2010, hosted by the Towler Institute located in Vallico di Sotto in Tuscany , Italy, which is loosely associated with the Theory of Condensed Matter group of the Cavendish Laboratory.

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] Among the questions announced for discussion, the organizers included "Why should young people be interested in these ideas, when showing interest in quantum foundations still might harm their careers?" [ 8 ] Work [ edit ] Valentini has been working on an extension of the causal interpretation of quantum theory . This interpretation had been proposed in conceptual terms in 1927 by Louis de Broglie , was independently re-discovered by David Bohm who brought it to a complete and systematic form in 1952, and was expanded on by Bohm and Basil Hiley . Emphasizing de Broglie's contribution, Valentini has consistently referred to the causal interpretation of quantum mechanics underlying his work as the " de Broglie–Bohm theory ".

Quantum equilibrium, locality and uncertainty [ edit ] In 1991, Valentini provided indications for deriving the quantum equilibrium hypothesis which states that ρ ρ ( x , y , z , t ) = | ψ ψ ( x , y , z , t ) | 2 {\displaystyle \rho (x,y,z,t)=|\psi (x,y,z,t)|^{2}} in the frame work of the pilot wave theory . Valentini showed that the relaxation ρ ρ ( x , y , z , t ) {\displaystyle \rho (x,y,z,t)} → | ψ ψ ( x , y , z , t ) | 2 {\displaystyle |\psi (x,y,z,t)|^{2}} may be accounted for by a H-theorem constructed in analogy to the Boltzmann H-theorem of statistical mechanics. Valentini showed that his expansion of the De Broglie–Bohm theory would allow "signal nonlocality " for non-equilibrium cases in which ρ ρ ( x , y , z , t ) {\displaystyle \rho (x,y,z,t)} ≠ | ψ ψ ( x , y , z , t ) | 2 {\displaystyle |\psi (x,y,z,t)|^{2}} .

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] According to Valentini, the universe is fundamentally nonlocal, and quantum theory merely describes a special equilibrium state in which nonlocality is hidden in statistical noise.

[ 12 ] He furthermore showed that an ensemble of particles with known wave function and known nonequilibrium distribution could be used to perform, on another system, measurements that violate the uncertainty principle .

[ 13 ] In 1992, Valentini extended pilot wave theory to spin- 1 / 2 {\displaystyle 1/2} fields and to gravitation.

[ 14 ] Background and implications [ edit ] Valentini has been described as an "ardent admirer of de Broglie". He noted that "de Broglie (rather like Maxwell) emphasized an underlying 'mechanical' picture: particles were assumed to be singularities of physical waves in space".

[ 15 ] He emphasized that de Broglie, with the assistance of Erwin Schrödinger , had constructed pilot wave theory, but later abandoned it in favor of quantum formalism.

[ 3 ] Valentini's derivation of the quantum equilibrium hypothesis was criticized by Detlef Dürr and co-workers in 1992, and the derivation of the quantum equilibrium hypothesis has remained a topic of active investigation.

[ 16 ] "Signal nonlocality ", which is forbidden in orthodox quantum theory, would allow nonlocal quantum entanglement to be used as a stand-alone communication channel without the need of a classical light-speed limited retarded signal to unlock the entangled message from the sender to the receiver. This would possibly make the string theory landscape Popper falsifiable .
