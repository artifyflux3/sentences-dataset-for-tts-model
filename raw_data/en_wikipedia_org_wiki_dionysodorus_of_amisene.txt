For the 3rd century BC mathematician, see Dionysodorus of Caunus .

Dionysodorus of Amisene (1st century AD) was a Greek mathematician from Pontus , now on the Black Sea coast of Turkey . He was briefly described by Strabo , as one of the learned men of the city of Amisus.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Despite the similarity of his demonym to the inland city of Amaseia , where Strabo was born, translators H. C. Hamilton and W. Falconer instead footnote Amisus as being the modern city Samsun , near Amaseia on the coast. Amisene is a name for the region containing both cities.

[ 2 ] Strabo distinguishes him from Dionysodorus of Melos, a geometer, [ 2 ] whom Pliny the Elder describes as having calculated the circumference of the Earth, less accurately than the older calculation of Eratosthenes . He should also be distinguished from Dionysodorus of Caunus , who studied conic sections .

[ 1 ] Dionysodorus of Amisene was long thought to be the Dionysodorus who studied conic sections until, in the early 20th century, Wilhelm Crönert [ de ] found from a papyrus newly excavated at Herculaneum a connection from the study of conics to Dionysodorus of Caunus and his son, also named Dionysodorus, dating them to centuries before the time that Strabo wrote about.
