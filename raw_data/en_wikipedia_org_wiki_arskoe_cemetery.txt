Entrance Arskoe Cemetery Arskoe Cemetery is the central necropolis in Kazan , and is located in the city's Vakhitovsky City District , to the northeast of Kazan's centre in Tatarstan, Russia.

The cemetery church was built in 1796, and was the only church in Kazan to remain open during the Soviet era.
