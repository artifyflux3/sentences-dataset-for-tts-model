Early life [ edit ] Blandford was born in Grantham , England and grew up in Birmingham , where he attended King Edward's School .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Career [ edit ] Blandford is famous in the astrophysical community for the Blandford–Znajek process , which is a mechanism for powering relativistic jets by the extraction of rotational energy from a black hole.

[ 3 ] The Blandford–Znajek mechanism has been invoked by the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration to explain the jet power in the first observation of a black hole shadow in the giant elliptical galaxy M87 .

[ 4 ] Blandford also theorized another mechanism for jet formation through hydromagnetic winds launched from accretion disks.

[ 5 ] In addition to the Blandford–Znajek and Blandford–Payne mechanisms for the formation of relativistic jets, Roger Blandford also helped devise a widely used theoretical model for jet geometric and spectral properties, the Blandford–Königl conical jet model, [ 6 ] used to predict radio shifts and low-frequency spectral slopes for optically thick jet cores.

[ 7 ] He has also made significant contributions to other astrophysical phenomena such as supernovae, by extending the Sedov–Taylor blast wave solution to the ultra-relativistic limit of the Blandford–McKee solution.

[ 6 ] In April 2005 he wrote a letter to the astronomy community showing his concern about the George W. Bush administration US space science policy.

[ 8 ] He was also the chair of Astro2010 , the decadal survey that helps define and recommend funding priorities for U.S. astronomy research in the upcoming decade. The Astro2010 report was released 13 August 2010.

[ 9 ] Positions [ edit ] Blandford is a Fellow of the Royal Society , Member of the U.S.

National Academy of Sciences , Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society and Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences .

[ 10 ] He is currently Luke Blossom Professor in the School of Humanities and Sciences at Stanford University , Professor of Physics at Stanford University and at Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) National Accelerator Laboratory .

[ 11 ] He was the Pehong and Adele Chen Director, Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology from 2003 to 2013.

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] He was a co-editor of the Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics (2005–2011).

[ 13 ] [ 14 ] Awards [ edit ] 2020 – Elected a Legacy Fellow of the American Astronomical Society [ 15 ] 2020 – Shaw Prize in Astronomy [ 16 ] 2016 – Crafoord Prize [ 17 ] 2013 – Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society [ 18 ] 2011 – Humboldt Prize [ 19 ] 1999 – Eddington Medal [ 20 ] 1998 – Dannie Heineman Prize for Astrophysics [ 21 ] 1982 – Helen B.
