History [ edit ] NRC Handelsblad was first published on 1 October 1970 after a merger of the Amsterdam newspaper Algemeen Handelsblad (founded 1828 by J.W. van den Biesen) and the Rotterdam Nieuwe Rotterdamsche Courant (founded 1844 by Henricus Nijgh).

Editor Folkert Jensma [ nl ] was succeeded on 12 December 2006, by Birgit Donker [ de ] .
