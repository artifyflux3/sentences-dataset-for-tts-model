[ 1 ] The concept in English usage is very broad: in a general sense it refers to being one (adjectival) or a group (noun) of official, authentic or approved rules or laws, particularly ecclesiastical ; or group of official, authentic, or approved literary or artistic works, such as the literature of a particular author, of a particular genre, or a particular group of religious scriptural texts; [ 2 ] or similarly, one or a body of rules, principles, or standards accepted as axiomatic and universally binding in a religion, or a field of study or art.

[ 3 ] Examples [ edit ] This principle of grouping has led to more specific uses of the word in different contexts, such as the Biblical canon (which a particular religious community regards as authoritative) and thence to literary canons (of a particular "body of literature in a particular language, or from a particular culture, period, genre").

[ 1 ] W.C Sayers (1915–1916) established a system of canons of library classification .

[ 4 ] S. R. Ranganathan developed a theory of facet analysis , which he presented as a detailed series of 46 canons, 13 postulates and 22 principles.

[ 5 ] There is also the concept of the canons of rhetoric , including five key principles that, when grouped together, are the principles set for giving speeches.
