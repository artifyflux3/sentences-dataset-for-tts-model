He was a Class of 1961 professor of mathematics at College of William and Mary .

[ 1 ] The books Matrix Analysis and Topics in Matrix Analysis , co-written by him with Roger Horn , are standard texts in advanced linear algebra.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Career [ edit ] Johnson received a B.A. with distinction in Mathematics and Economics from Northwestern University in 1969. In 1972, he received a Ph.D. in Mathematics and Economics from the California Institute of Technology , where he was advised by Olga Taussky Todd ; his dissertation was entitled "Matrices whose Hermitian Part is Positive Definite".

[ 5 ] Johnson held various professorships over ten years at the University of Maryland, College Park starting in 1974. He was a professor at Clemson University from 1984 to 1987.

[ citation needed ] He was a professor of mathematics at the College of William and Mary from 1987 to 2024.
