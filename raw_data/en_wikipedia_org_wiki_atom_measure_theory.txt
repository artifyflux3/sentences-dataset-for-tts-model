A measure that has no atoms is called non-atomic or atomless .

Definition [ edit ] Given a measurable space ( X , Σ Σ ) {\displaystyle (X,\Sigma )} and a measure μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } on that space, a set A ⊂ ⊂ X {\displaystyle A\subset X} in Σ Σ {\displaystyle \Sigma } is called an atom if μ μ ( A ) > 0 {\displaystyle \mu (A)>0} and for any measurable subset B ⊆ ⊆ A {\displaystyle B\subseteq A} , either μ μ ( B ) = 0 {\displaystyle \mu (B)=0} or μ μ ( B ) = μ μ ( A ) {\displaystyle \mu (B)=\mu (A)} .

[ 1 ] The equivalence class of A {\displaystyle A} is defined by [ A ] := { B ∈ ∈ Σ Σ : μ μ ( A Δ Δ B ) = 0 } , {\displaystyle [A]:=\{B\in \Sigma :\mu (A\Delta B)=0\},} where Δ Δ {\displaystyle \Delta } is the symmetric difference operator. If A {\displaystyle A} is an atom then all the subsets in [ A ] {\displaystyle [A]} are atoms and [ A ] {\displaystyle [A]} is called an atomic class .

[ 2 ] If μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } is a σ σ {\displaystyle \sigma } -finite measure, there are countably many atomic classes.

Examples [ edit ] Consider the set X = {1, 2, ..., 9, 10} and let the sigma-algebra Σ Σ {\displaystyle \Sigma } be the power set of X . Define the measure μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } of a set to be its cardinality , that is, the number of elements in the set. Then, each of the singletons { i }, for i = 1, 2, ..., 9, 10 is an atom.

Consider the Lebesgue measure on the real line . This measure has no atoms.

Atomic measures [ edit ] A σ σ {\displaystyle \sigma } -finite measure μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } on a measurable space ( X , Σ Σ ) {\displaystyle (X,\Sigma )} is called atomic or purely atomic if every measurable set of positive measure contains an atom. This is equivalent to say that there is a countable partition of X {\displaystyle X} formed by atoms up to a null set.

[ 3 ] The assumption of σ σ {\displaystyle \sigma } -finitude is essential. Consider otherwise the space ( R , P ( R ) , ν ν ) {\displaystyle (\mathbb {R} ,{\mathcal {P}}(\mathbb {R} ),\nu )} where ν ν {\displaystyle \nu } denotes the counting measure . This space is atomic, with all atoms being the singletons , yet the space is not able to be partitioned into the disjoint union of countably many disjoint atoms, ⋃ ⋃ n = 1 ∞ ∞ A n {\textstyle \bigcup _{n=1}^{\infty }A_{n}} and a null set N {\displaystyle N} since the countable union of singletons is a countable set, and the uncountability of the real numbers shows that the complement N = R ∖ ∖ ⋃ ⋃ n = 1 ∞ ∞ A n {\textstyle N=\mathbb {R} \setminus \bigcup _{n=1}^{\infty }A_{n}} would have to be uncountable, hence its ν ν {\displaystyle \nu } -measure would be infinite, in contradiction to it being a null set. The validity of the result for σ σ {\displaystyle \sigma } -finite spaces follows from the proof for finite measure spaces by observing that the countable union of countable unions is again a countable union, and that the countable unions of null sets are null.

Discrete measures [ edit ] See also: Discrete measure A σ σ {\displaystyle \sigma } -finite atomic measure μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } is called discrete if the intersection of the atoms of any atomic class is non empty. 
It is equivalent [ 4 ] to say that μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } is the weighted sum of countably many Dirac measures, that is, there is a sequence x 1 , x 2 , .

.

.

{\displaystyle x_{1},x_{2},...} of points in X {\displaystyle X} , and a sequence c 1 , c 2 , .

.

.

{\displaystyle c_{1},c_{2},...} of positive real numbers (the weights) such that μ μ = ∑ ∑ k = 1 ∞ ∞ c k δ δ x k {\textstyle \mu =\sum _{k=1}^{\infty }c_{k}\delta _{x_{k}}} , which means that μ μ ( A ) = ∑ ∑ k = 1 ∞ ∞ c k δ δ x k ( A ) {\textstyle \mu (A)=\sum _{k=1}^{\infty }c_{k}\delta _{x_{k}}(A)} for every A ∈ ∈ Σ Σ {\displaystyle A\in \Sigma } . We can choose each point x k {\displaystyle x_{k}} to be a common point of the atoms
in the k {\displaystyle k} -th atomic class.

A discrete measure is atomic but the inverse implication fails: take X = [ 0 , 1 ] {\displaystyle X=[0,1]} , Σ Σ {\displaystyle \Sigma } the σ σ {\displaystyle \sigma } -algebra of countable and co-countable subsets, μ μ = 0 {\displaystyle \mu =0} in countable subsets and μ μ = 1 {\displaystyle \mu =1} in co-countable subsets. Then there is a single atomic class, the one formed by the co-countable subsets. The measure μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } is atomic but the intersection of the atoms in the unique atomic class is empty and μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } can't be put as a sum of Dirac measures.

If every atom is equivalent to a singleton, then μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } is discrete iff it is atomic. In this case the x k {\displaystyle x_{k}} above are the atomic singletons, so they are unique. Any finite measure in a separable metric space provided with the Borel sets satisfies this condition.

[ 5 ] Non-atomic measures [ edit ] A measure which has no atoms is called non-atomic measure or a diffuse measure . In other words, a measure μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } is non-atomic if for any measurable set A {\displaystyle A} with μ μ ( A ) > 0 {\displaystyle \mu (A)>0} there exists a measurable subset B {\displaystyle B} of A {\displaystyle A} such that μ μ ( A ) > μ μ ( B ) > 0.

{\displaystyle \mu (A)>\mu (B)>0.} A non-atomic measure with at least one positive value has an infinite number of distinct values, as starting with a set A {\displaystyle A} with μ μ ( A ) > 0 {\displaystyle \mu (A)>0} one can construct a decreasing sequence of measurable sets A = A 1 ⊃ ⊃ A 2 ⊃ ⊃ A 3 ⊃ ⊃ ⋯ ⋯ {\displaystyle A=A_{1}\supset A_{2}\supset A_{3}\supset \cdots } such that μ μ ( A ) = μ μ ( A 1 ) > μ μ ( A 2 ) > μ μ ( A 3 ) > ⋯ ⋯ > 0.

{\displaystyle \mu (A)=\mu (A_{1})>\mu (A_{2})>\mu (A_{3})>\cdots >0.} This may not be true for measures having atoms; see the first example above.

It turns out that non-atomic measures actually have a continuum of values. It can be proved that if μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } is a non-atomic measure and A {\displaystyle A} is a measurable set with μ μ ( A ) > 0 , {\displaystyle \mu (A)>0,} then for any real number b {\displaystyle b} satisfying μ μ ( A ) ≥ ≥ b ≥ ≥ 0 {\displaystyle \mu (A)\geq b\geq 0} there exists a measurable subset B {\displaystyle B} of A {\displaystyle A} such that μ μ ( B ) = b .

{\displaystyle \mu (B)=b.} This theorem is due to Wacław Sierpiński .

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] It is reminiscent of the intermediate value theorem for continuous functions.

Sketch of proof of Sierpiński's theorem on non-atomic measures. A slightly stronger statement, which however makes the proof easier, is that if ( X , Σ Σ , μ μ ) {\displaystyle (X,\Sigma ,\mu )} is a non-atomic measure space and μ μ ( X ) = c , {\displaystyle \mu (X)=c,} there exists a function S : [ 0 , c ] → → Σ Σ {\displaystyle S:[0,c]\to \Sigma } that is monotone with respect to inclusion, and a right-inverse to μ μ : Σ Σ → → [ 0 , c ] .

{\displaystyle \mu :\Sigma \to [0,c].} That is, there exists a one-parameter family of measurable sets S ( t ) {\displaystyle S(t)} such that for all 0 ≤ ≤ t ≤ ≤ t ′ ≤ ≤ c {\displaystyle 0\leq t\leq t'\leq c} S ( t ) ⊆ ⊆ S ( t ′ ) , {\displaystyle S(t)\subseteq S(t'),} μ μ ( S ( t ) ) = t .

{\displaystyle \mu \left(S(t)\right)=t.} The proof easily follows from Zorn's lemma applied to the set of all monotone partial sections to μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } : Γ Γ := { S : D → → Σ Σ : D ⊆ ⊆ [ 0 , c ] , S m o n o t o n e , for all t ∈ ∈ D ( μ μ ( S ( t ) ) = t ) } , {\displaystyle \Gamma :=\{S:D\to \Sigma \;:\;D\subseteq [0,c],\,S\;\mathrm {monotone} ,{\text{ for all }}t\in D\;(\mu (S(t))=t)\},} ordered by inclusion of graphs, g r a p h ( S ) ⊆ ⊆ g r a p h ( S ′ ) .

{\displaystyle \mathrm {graph} (S)\subseteq \mathrm {graph} (S').} It's then standard to show that every chain in Γ Γ {\displaystyle \Gamma } has an upper bound in Γ Γ , {\displaystyle \Gamma ,} and that any maximal element of Γ Γ {\displaystyle \Gamma } has domain [ 0 , c ] , {\displaystyle [0,c],} proving the claim.
