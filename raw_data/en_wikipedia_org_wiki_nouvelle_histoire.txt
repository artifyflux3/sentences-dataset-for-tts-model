The movement can be associated with cultural history , history of representations, and histoire des mentalités .

[ 2 ] The new history movement's inclusive definition of the proper matter of historical study has also given it the label total history . The movement was contrasted with the traditional ways of writing history which focused on politics and " great men ". The new history rejected any insistence on composing historical narrative ; an emphasis on administrative documents as basic source materials; concern with individuals' motivations and intentions as explanatory factors for historical events; and the old belief in objectivity .

[ citation needed ] The approach was rejected by Marxist historians because it downplayed what Marxists believed was the central role of class in shaping history.

[ 3 ] [ verification needed ] History in schools [ edit ] The teaching of history in French schools was influenced by the nouvelle histoire , as disseminated in the 1960s and 1970s by Cahiers pédagogiques [ fr ] and Enseignement 70 and other journals for teachers.

[ 4 ] Also influential was the Institut national de recherche et de documentation pédagogique .

[ 4 ] Joseph Leif, the inspector-general of teacher training, said pupils should learn about historians' approaches as well as facts and dates.

[ 4 ] Louis François, dean of the history/geography group in the Inspectorate of National Education, advised teachers to provide historic documents and promote "active methods", which would give pupils "the immense happiness of discovery".

[ 4 ] Proponents said it was a reaction against the memorization of names and dates that characterized traditional teaching and left bored students. Traditionalists protested loudly that it was a postmodern innovation that threatened to leave the youth ignorant of French patriotism and national identity.

[ 5 ] [ failed verification ] Germany [ edit ] The nouvelle histoire became controversial after 1945 in German historiography , where it especially influenced medieval studies .

[ 6 ] However most German historians considered the approach too positivistic for their taste, and not philosophical enough.
