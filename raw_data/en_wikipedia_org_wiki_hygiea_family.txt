Characteristics [ edit ] Location and structure of the Hygiea family.

By far the largest member is 10 Hygiea , a 400 km diameter C-type asteroid that is the fourth largest in the belt. The remaining members are much smaller so Hygiea contains about 94–98% of the mass in the family (depending on the exact criteria for inclusion). The two next largest members are 333 Badenia , and 538 Friederike , both just over 70 km in diameter. After that, the remaining members have diameters of less than 30 km.

The Hygiea family is thought to have arisen from a catastrophically disruptive impact, after which Hygiea re-accumulated. The two 70-kilometer-diameter bodies, which are much larger than, for example, the Vesta family , which contains no members above around 10 km in diameter, are consistent with this scenario.

The family contains a significant number of objects of the otherwise rare B spectral type (Mothé-Diniz 2001). The largest of these is the previously mentioned 538 Friederike .

Location and size [ edit ] A HCM numerical analysis by (Zappala 1995) found a 'core' group of family members, whose proper orbital elements lie in the approximate ranges a p e p i p min 3.06 AU 0.109 4.2° max 3.22 AU 0.163 5.8° At the present epoch , the range of osculating orbital elements of these core members is a e i min 3.06 AU 0.088 3.5° max 3.24 AU 0.191 6.8° The 1995 analysis by Zappalà found 103 core members, whereas a search of a recent proper element database (AstDys)for 96944 minor planets in 2005 yielded 1043 objects lying within the rectangular-shaped region defined by the first table above. This would give about 1% of all asteroids in the asteroid belt.

Interlopers [ edit ] This family contains quite a large number of identified interlopers. The following have been identified in a spectral survey (Mothé-Diniz 2001), and also by inspection of the PDS asteroid taxonomy data set for S- and D-type members: 100 Hekate , 108 Hecuba , 1109 Tata , 1209 Pumma , and 1599 Giomus .

In fact, some of the other asteroids of the C spectral type are probably interlopers as well, due to the prevalence of this spectral type in the region. Possible candidates include 333 Badenia and 538 Friederike , based on their unusually large size for cratering family members.

52 Europa , a very large 300 km diameter asteroid, orbits nearby with a proper inclination of 6.37°, and was sometimes considered part of the Hygiea family in the past, but it is an unrelated asteroid. A better sampling of asteroids in the area in recent years has clearly shown that it orbits well beyond the Hygiea family clump.
