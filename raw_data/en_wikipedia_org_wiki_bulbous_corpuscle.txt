Skin mechanoreceptor Ruffini ending Nerve ending of Ruffini.

Details Part of Skin Function Mechanoreceptor Identifiers Latin corpusculum sensorium fusiforme TH H3.11.06.0.00017 TE corpuscle_by_E5.17.1.0.2.0.15   E5.17.1.0.2.0.15 FMA 83602 Anatomical terminology [ edit on Wikidata ] The bulbous corpuscle , Ruffini ending or Ruffini corpuscle is a slowly adapting mechanoreceptor located in the cutaneous tissue between the dermal papillae and the hypodermis. It is named after Angelo Ruffini .

Structure [ edit ] Ruffini corpuscles are enlarged dendritic endings with elongated capsules.

[ 1 ] Ruffini corpuscle from original slide sent by Ruffini to Sir Charles Sherrington [ 2 ] Function [ edit ] This spindle-shaped receptor is sensitive to skin stretch, and contributes to the kinesthetic sense of and control of finger position and movement.

[ 3 ] They are at the highest density around the fingernails where they act in monitoring slippage of objects along the surface of the skin, allowing modulation of grip on an object.

[ citation needed ] Ruffini corpuscles respond to sustained pressure [ 4 ] and show very little adaptation.

[ 5 ] Ruffinian endings are located in the deep layers of the skin, and register mechanical deformation within joints, more specifically angle change, with a specificity of up to 2.75 degrees, as well as continuous pressure states.  They also act as thermoreceptors that respond for a long time, so in case of deep burn there will be no pain, as these receptors will be burned off.
