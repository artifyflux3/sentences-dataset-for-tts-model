Located in the Kendall Square area near MIT , the school serves 360 students in grades 6-12. CCSC opened in September 2005.

History [ edit ] The school was initially scheduled to open in the fall of 2005 with grades 7 and 8. It was to receive 180 students, with 150 being from Cambridge .

[ 2 ] Paula Evans, a former headmaster of the Cambridge Rindge & Latin School , co-founded the school with Emma Stellman, formerly a physics teacher from Cambridge Rindge & Latin, and Rob Riordan, a co-founder of High Tech High and former faculty member at Cambridge Rindge & Latin.

The school had a controversial start. Before it was granted a charter from the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education , the Cambridge Public Schools superintendent and members of the school committee of the Cambridge Public Schools (CPS) asked Evans to halt her project. Nancy Walser, a board member of CPS at the time, said that some members of the charter school board had resigned by February 2004 and that opponents to the charter school passed the information along but never pressured people.

[ 3 ] Notable alumni [ edit ] Dzhokhar Tsarnaev [ 4 ] – Boston Marathon bomber and terrorist; attended the middle school program, withdrew in grade 9.

[ 5 ] Moses Rakoff-O'Neill - Massachusetts public forum debater; attended the middle school program, withdrew in grade 9.
