Biography [ edit ] Voigt was born in Leipzig , and died in Göttingen . He was a student of Franz Ernst Neumann .

[ 2 ] Voigt taught at the Georg August University of Göttingen and eventually went on to head the Mathematical Physics Department there. He was succeeded in 1914 by Peter Debye , who took charge of the theoretical department of the Physical Institute.

Voigt worked on crystal physics , thermodynamics and electro-optics . His main work was the Lehrbuch der Kristallphysik ( Textbook on crystal physics ), first published in 1910. He discovered what is now called the Voigt effect in 1898. The word tensor in its current meaning was introduced by him in 1898.

[ 3 ] Voigt profile and Voigt notation are named after him. He was also an amateur musician and became known as a Bach expert (see External links). He was the first to suggest, in 1886, that Bach's Concerto for two harpsichords in C minor, BWV 1060 was originally scored for violin and oboe.

In 1887 Voigt formulated a form of the Lorentz transformation between a rest frame of reference and a frame moving with speed v {\displaystyle v} in the x {\displaystyle x} direction. However, as Voigt himself said, the transformation was aimed at a specific problem and did not carry with it the idea of a general coordinate transformation , as is the case in relativity theory .

[ 4 ] Voigt transformation [ edit ] Further information: History of Lorentz transformations In modern notation Voigt's transformation was x ′ = x − − v t , {\displaystyle x'=x-vt,} y ′ = y / γ γ , {\displaystyle y'=y/\gamma ,} z ′ = z / γ γ , {\displaystyle z'=z/\gamma ,} t ′ = t − − v x / c 2 , {\displaystyle t'=t-vx/c^{2},} where γ γ = 1 / 1 − − v 2 / c 2 {\displaystyle \gamma =1/{\sqrt {1-v^{2}/c^{2}}}} .
If the right-hand sides of his equations are multiplied by γ γ {\displaystyle \gamma } , they become the modern Lorentz transformation .

Hermann Minkowski said in 1908 that the transformations which play the main role in the principle of relativity were first examined by Voigt in 1887. Also Hendrik Lorentz (1909) is on record as saying that he could have taken these transformations into his theory of electrodynamics, if only he had known of them, rather than developing his own. It is interesting then to examine the consequences of these transformations from this point of view. Lorentz might then have seen that the transformation introduced relativity of simultaneity , and also time dilation . However, the magnitude of the dilation was greater than the now accepted value in the Lorentz transformations. Moving clocks, obeying Voigt's time transformation, indicate an elapsed time Δ Δ t Voigt = γ γ − − 2 Δ Δ t = γ γ − − 1 Δ Δ t Lorentz {\displaystyle \Delta t_{\text{Voigt}}=\gamma ^{-2}\Delta t=\gamma ^{-1}\Delta t_{\text{Lorentz}}} , while stationary clocks indicate an elapsed time Δ Δ t {\displaystyle \Delta t} .

Since Voigt's transformation preserves the speed of light in all frames, the Michelson–Morley experiment and the Kennedy–Thorndike experiment can not distinguish between the two transformations. The crucial question is the issue of time dilation. The experimental measurement of time dilation by Ives and Stillwell (1938) and others settled the issue in favor of the Lorentz transformation.

From page 20: "Wir wollen uns deshalb nur darauf stützen, dass Zustände der geschilderten Art bei Spannungen und Dehnungen nicht starrer Körper auftreten, und sie deshalb tensorielle, die für sie charakteristischen physikalischen Grössen aber Tensoren nennen." (We therefore want [our presentation] to be based only on [the assumption that] conditions of the type described occur during stresses and strains of non-rigid bodies, and therefore call them "tensorial" but call the characteristic physical quantities for them "tensors".) ^ Voigt, W.

Voigt, W. (1887), "Theorie des Lichts für bewegte Medien" , Göttinger Nachrichten (8): 177– 238 ; This article ends with the announcement that in a forthcoming article the principles worked out so far shall be applied to the problems of reflection and refraction. The article contains on p. 235, last paragraph, and on p. 236, 2nd paragraph, a judgment on the Michelson experiment of 1886, which Voigt, after a correspondence with H. A. Lorentz in 1887 and 1888, has partly withdrawn in the article announced, namely in a footnote in Voigt (1888). According to Voigt's first judgment, the Michelson experiment must yield a null result, independently of whether the Earth transports the luminiferous aether with it (Fizeau's 1st aether hypothesis), or whether the Earth moves through an entirely independent, self-consistent universal luminiferous aether (Fizeau's 2nd aether hypothesis).

A. Lorentz, he can no longer maintain that in the case of the validity of Fizeau's 2nd aether hypothesis the Michelson experiment must yield a null result too.
