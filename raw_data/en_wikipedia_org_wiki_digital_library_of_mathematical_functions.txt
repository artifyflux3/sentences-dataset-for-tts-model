It is intended as an update of Abramowitz's and Stegun's Handbook of Mathematical Functions (A&S).

[ 1 ] It was published online [ 2 ] on 7 May 2010, though some chapters appeared earlier. In the same year it appeared at Cambridge University Press under the title NIST Handbook of Mathematical Functions .

[ 3 ] In contrast to A&S, whose initial print run was done by the U.S. Government Printing Office and was in the public domain , NIST asserts that it holds copyright to the DLMF under Title 17 USC 105 of the U.S. Code.
