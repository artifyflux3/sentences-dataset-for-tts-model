John T. Graves

**John Thomas Graves** (4 December 1806–29 March 1870) was an Irish [jurist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurist "Jurist") and mathematician. He was a friend of [William Rowan Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton "William Rowan Hamilton"), and is credited both with inspiring [Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton "William Rowan Hamilton") to discover the [quaternions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion "Quaternion") in October 1843 and then discovering their generalization the [octonions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octonion "Octonion") himself (he called them _octaves_) later that same year.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_T._Graves#cite_note-1) He was the brother of both the mathematician and bishop [Charles Graves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Graves_(bishop) "Charles Graves (bishop)")[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_T._Graves#cite_note-2) and the writer and clergyman [Robert Perceval Graves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Perceval_Graves "Robert Perceval Graves").

Born in Dublin 4 December 1806, he was son of John Crosbie Graves, barrister, grandnephew of [Richard Graves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Graves "Richard Graves"), D.D., and cousin of [Robert James Graves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_James_Graves "Robert James Graves"), M.D. He was sent to school in England, in the parish of [Westbury-on-Trym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westbury-on-Trym "Westbury-on-Trym"), then a village outside Bristol, under the Rev. Samuel Feild (Field in the _[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford\_Dictionary\_of\_National\_Biography "Oxford Dictionary of National Biography")_), later vicar of [Hatherleigh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatherleigh "Hatherleigh").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_T._Graves#cite_note-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_T._Graves#cite_note-4) Feild has been described as a "prominent second generation evangelical Anglican";[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_T._Graves#cite_note-5) he was one of two curates in the parish, under Richard Carrow, the parish priest, as [perpetual curate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpetual_curate "Perpetual curate").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_T._Graves#cite_note-6)

Graves was an undergraduate at [Trinity College Dublin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_College_Dublin "Trinity College Dublin"), where he distinguished himself in both science and classics, and was a class-fellow and friend of [William Rowan Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton "William Rowan Hamilton"), graduating B.A. in 1827. He then moved to Oxford, where he became an incorporated member of [Oriel College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriel_College "Oriel College"), 11 November 1830. Graves proceeded M.A. at Oxford in 1831, and at Dublin in 1832.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_T._Graves#cite_note-DNB-7)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_T._Graves#cite_note-alox-8)

Having in 1830 entered the [King's Inns, Dublin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_Inns,_Dublin "King's Inns, Dublin"), Graves was [called to the English bar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Called_to_the_bar "Called to the bar") in 1831, as a member of the [Inner Temple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_Temple "Inner Temple").[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_T._Graves#cite_note-alox-8) For a short time he went the Western circuit. In 1839 he was appointed professor of jurisprudence in [London University College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_University_College "London University College") in a delayed succession to [John Austin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Austin_(legal_philosopher) "John Austin (legal philosopher)"). Not long after, he was elected an examiner in laws in the [University of London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_London "University of London").[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_T._Graves#cite_note-DNB-7)

Graves was one of the committee of the [Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_for_the_Diffusion_of_Useful_Knowledge "Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge"). In 1839 he was elected as a [Fellow of the Royal Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fellow_of_the_Royal_Society "Fellow of the Royal Society"), and he subsequently sat on its council. He was also a member of the [Philological Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philological_Society "Philological Society") and of the [Royal Society of Literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Society_of_Literature "Royal Society of Literature"). In 1846 Graves was appointed an assistant poor-law commissioner, and in the next year, under the new [Poor Law Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Poor_Law_Act&action=edit&redlink=1 "Poor Law Act (page does not exist)"), one of the poor-law inspectors of England and Wales.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_T._Graves#cite_note-DNB-7)

in 1846 Graves married Amelia Tooke, a daughter of [William Tooke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Tooke_(1777-1863) "William Tooke (1777-1863)"),[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_T._Graves#cite_note-9) and died without issue on 29 March 1870 at Cheltenham.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_T._Graves#cite_note-DNB-7)

In his twentieth year (1826) Graves engaged in researches on the [exponential function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_function "Exponential function") and the [complex logarithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_logarithm "Complex logarithm"); they were printed in the _[Philosophical Transactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical\_Transactions "Philosophical Transactions")_ for 1829 under the title _An Attempt to Rectify the Inaccuracy of some Logarithmic Formulæ._[Alexandre-Joseph-Hidulphe Vincent](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alexandre-Joseph-Hidulphe_Vincent&action=edit&redlink=1 "Alexandre-Joseph-Hidulphe Vincent (page does not exist)") claimed to have arrived in 1825 at similar results, which, however, were not published by him till 1832. The conclusions announced by Graves were not at first accepted by [George Peacock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Peacock_(mathematician) "George Peacock (mathematician)"), who referred to them in his _Report on Algebra_, nor by [Sir John Herschel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_John_Herschel "Sir John Herschel"). Graves communicated to the [British Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Association "British Association") in 1834 (_Report_ for that year) on his discovery.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_T._Graves#cite_note-DNB-7)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_T._Graves#cite_note-10)

In the same report is a supporting paper by Hamilton, _On Conjugate Functions or Algebraic Couples, as tending to illustrate generally the Doctrine of Imaginary Quantities, and as confirming the Results of Mr. Graves respecting the existence of Two independent Integers in the complete expression of an Imaginary Logarithm._ It was an anticipation, as far as publication was concerned, of an extended memoir, which had been read by Hamilton before the [Royal Irish Academy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Irish_Academy "Royal Irish Academy") on 24 November 1833, _On Conjugate Functions or Algebraic Couples_, and subsequently published in the seventeenth volume of the _Transactions_ of the Royal Irish Academy. To this memoir were prefixed _A Preliminary and Elementary Essay on Algebra as the Science of Pure Time_, and some _General Introductory Remarks_. In the concluding paragraphs of each of these three papers Hamilton acknowledges that it was "in reflecting on the important symbolical results of Mr. Graves respecting imaginary logarithms, and in attempting to explain to himself the theoretical meaning of those remarkable symbolisms", that he was conducted to "the theory of conjugate functions, which, leading on to a theory of triplets and sets of moments, steps, and numbers" were foundational for his own work, culminating in the discovery of quaternions.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_T._Graves#cite_note-DNB-7)

For many years Graves and Hamilton maintained a correspondence on the interpretation of imaginaries. In 1843 Hamilton discovered the quaternions, and it was to Graves that he made on 17 October his first written communication of the discovery. In his preface to the _Lectures on Quaternions_ and in a prefatory letter to a communication to the _[Philosophical Magazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical\_Magazine "Philosophical Magazine")_ for December 1844 are acknowledgments of his indebtedness to Graves for stimulus and suggestion. Immediately after the discovery of quaternions, before the end of 1843, Graves successfully extended to eight squares [Euler's four-square identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_four-square_identity "Euler's four-square identity"), and went on to conceive a theory of "octaves" (now called [octonions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octonion "Octonion")) analogous to Hamilton's theory of quaternions, introducing four imaginaries additional to Hamilton's _i_, _j_ and _k_, and conforming to "the law of the modulus".[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_T._Graves#cite_note-DNB-7) Octonions are a contemporary if abstruse area of contemporary research of the [Standard Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model "Standard Model") of particle physics.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_T._Graves#cite_note-The_Peculiar_Math_That_Could_Underlie_the_Laws_of_Nature-11) Shortly before the discovery, Graves wrote in a letter addressed to Hamilton on 26 October 1843, "If with your alchemy you can make three pounds of gold, why should you stop there?"[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_T._Graves#cite_note-12)

Graves devised also a pure-triplet system founded on the roots of positive unity, simultaneously with his brother Charles Graves, the bishop of Limerick. He afterwards stimulated Hamilton to the study of polyhedra, and was told of the discovery of the [icosian calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icosian_calculus "Icosian calculus").[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_T._Graves#cite_note-DNB-7)

Graves contributed also to the _Philosophical Magazine_ for April 1836 a paper _On the lately proposed Logarithms of Unity in reply to Professor De Morgan_, and in the _[London and Edinburgh Philosophical Magazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London\_and\_Edinburgh\_Philosophical\_Magazine "London and Edinburgh Philosophical Magazine")_ for the same year a "postscript" entitled _Explanation of a Remarkable Paradox in the Calculus of Functions, noticed by Mr. Babbage._ To the same periodical he contributed in September 1838 _A New and General Solution of Cubic Equations_; in 1839 a paper _On the Functional Symmetry exhibited in the Notation of certain Geometrical Porisms, when they are stated merely with reference to the arrangement of points_; and in April 1845 a paper on the _Connection between the General Theory of Normal Couples and the Theory of Complete Quadratic Functions of Two Variables_. A subsequent number contains a contribution _On the Rev. J. G. MacVicar's Experiment on Vision_, on the work of [John Gibson Macvicar](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Gibson_Macvicar&action=edit&redlink=1 "John Gibson Macvicar (page does not exist)"); and the _Report_ of the Cheltenham meeting in 1856 of the British Association contains abstracts of papers communicated by him _On the Polyhedron of Forces_ and _On the Congruence nx ≡ n + 1 (mod. p.)._[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_T._Graves#cite_note-DNB-7)

The records of Graves's work as a jurist are twelve lectures on the law of nations, reported in the _[Law Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law\_Times "Law Times")_, commencing 25 April 1845, and two elaborate articles contributed to the _[Encyclopædia Metropolitana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A6dia\_Metropolitana "Encyclopædia Metropolitana")_ on [Roman law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_law "Roman law") and [canon law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_law "Canon law"). He was also a contributor to [William Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Smith_(lexicographer) "William Smith (lexicographer)")'s _[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary\_of\_Greek\_and\_Roman\_Biography\_and\_Mythology "Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology")_, with lives of the jurists [Cato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Porcius_Cato_Licinianus "Marcus Porcius Cato Licinianus"), [Crassus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Licinius_Crassus "Lucius Licinius Crassus"), [Drusus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaius_Livius_Drusus_(jurist) "Gaius Livius Drusus (jurist)"), [Gaius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaius_(jurist) "Gaius (jurist)"), and an article on the legislation of [Justinian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justinian_I "Justinian I").[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_T._Graves#cite_note-DNB-7)

For many years Graves collected mathematical works. This portion of his library, more than ten thousand books and about five thousand pamphlets, was bequeathed to [University College London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_College_London "University College London") in 1870.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_T._Graves#cite_note-DNB-7)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_T._Graves#cite_note-13) The library, which is believed to be the largest collection of mathematical works in the UK, contains a first edition of [Sir Issac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton")'s _[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophi%C3%A6\_Naturalis\_Principia\_Mathematica "Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica")._[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_T._Graves#cite_note-14)

Notes for jurisprudence lectures given by Graves 1839–1843 are also held at [University College London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_College_London "University College London").[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_T._Graves#cite_note-15)
