For other uses, see Yuga (disambiguation) .

A yuga , in Hinduism , is generally used to indicate an age of time.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] In the Rigveda , a yuga refers to generations, a period of time (whether long or short), or a yoke (joining of two things).

[ 3 ] In the Mahabharata , the words yuga and kalpa (a day of Brahma ) are used interchangeably to describe the cycle of creation and destruction.

[ 4 ] In post-Vedic texts, the words  " yuga " and "age" commonly denote a catur-yuga (pronounced chatur yuga ), a cycle of four world ages—for example, in the Surya Siddhanta and Bhagavad Gita (part of the Mahabharata )—unless expressly limited by the name of one of its minor ages: Krita (Satya) Yuga , Treta Yuga , Dvapara Yuga , or Kali Yuga .

[ 1 ] [ 5 ] [ a ] The term " yuga " can represent the number 4. In early Indian astronomy, it referred to a five-year cycle starting with the conjunction of the sun and moon in the autumnal equinox.

[ 8 ] Etymology [ edit ] Yuga ( Sanskrit : युग ) means "a yoke " (joining of two things), "generations", or "a period of time" such as an age, where its archaic spelling is yug , with other forms of yugam , yugānāṃ , and yuge , derived from yuj ( Sanskrit : युज् , lit.

'to join or yoke'), believed derived from * yeug- ( Proto-Indo-European : lit.

'to join or unite').

[ 9 ] See also [ edit ] Hindu units of time Kalpa (day of Brahma ) Manvantara (age of Manu ) Pralaya (period of dissolution) Yuga Cycle (four yuga ages): Satya (Krita) , Treta , Dvapara , and Kali List of numbers in Hindu scriptures Explanatory notes [ edit ] ^ The general word " yuga " is sometimes used instead of the more specific word " catur-yuga ". A kalpa is described as lasting 1,000 catur-yuga in Bhagavata Purana 12.4.2 (" catur-yuga ") [ 6 ] and Bhagavad Gita 8.17 (" yuga ").

It is quite clear that the smallest unit was the 'nimisah' ['winking of eyes'], and that time in the general sense of past, present and future was indicated by the word 'yuga'.

The word yuga occurs at least thirty-eight times in the Rigveda, but the meaning is rather doubtful. In a few places yuga means yoke ... In many places it appears to refer to a very brief period ... Generally yuga appears to mean in the Rigveda 'generation' (lessening the life of human generations) ... In other places 'yuga' must be given the sense of a 'long period of time' ...

The cycle [of creation and destruction] is either called a yuga (MBh. 1.1.28; 12.327.89; 13.135.11), a kalpa, meaning a formation or a creation (MBh. 6.31.7 [= BhG. 9.7]; 12.326.70; 12.327.23), or a day of the brahman, or of Brahmā, the creator god (MBh. 12.224.28–31). Sometimes, it is simply referred to as the process of creation and destruction (saṃhāravikṣepa; MBh. 12.271.30, 40, 43, 47–49).

The period of 4,320,000 years is ordinarily styled Great Age (mahayuga), or, as above in two instances [1.15-16], Quadruple Age (caturyuga). In the Surya-Siddhanta, however, the former term is not once found, and the latter occurs only in these verses; elsewhere, Age (yuga) alone is employed to denote it, and always denotes it, unless expressly limited by the name of the Golden (krta) Age.
