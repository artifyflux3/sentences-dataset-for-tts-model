The amount of energy is directly proportional to the photon's electromagnetic frequency and thus, equivalently, is inversely proportional to the wavelength . The higher the photon's frequency, the higher its energy. Equivalently, the longer the photon's wavelength, the lower its energy.

Photon energy can be expressed using any energy unit . Among the units commonly used to denote photon energy are the electronvolt (eV) and the joule (as well as its multiples, such as the microjoule). As one joule equals 6.24 × 10 18 eV , the larger units may be more useful in denoting the energy of photons with higher frequency and higher energy, such as gamma rays , as opposed to lower energy photons as in the optical and radio frequency regions of the electromagnetic spectrum .

Formulas [ edit ] Physics [ edit ] Photon energy is directly proportional to frequency.

[ 1 ] E = h f {\displaystyle E=hf} where E {\displaystyle E} is energy ( joules in the SI system ) [ 2 ] h {\displaystyle h} is the Planck constant f {\displaystyle f} is frequency [ 2 ] This equation is known as the Planck relation .

Additionally, using equation f = c / λ , E = h c λ λ {\displaystyle E={\frac {hc}{\lambda }}} where E is the photon's energy λ is the photon's wavelength c is the speed of light in vacuum h is the Planck constant The photon energy at 1 Hz is equal to 6.626 070 15 × 10 −34 J , which is equal to 4.135 667 697 × 10 −15 eV .

Electronvolt [ edit ] Photon energy is often measured in electronvolts. One electronvolt (eV) is exactly 1.602 176 634 × 10 −19 J ‍ [ 3 ] or, using the atto prefix, 0.160 217 6634 aJ , in the SI system . To find the photon energy in electronvolt using the wavelength in micrometres , the equation is approximately E (eV) = 1.2398 λ λ (μm) {\displaystyle E{\text{ (eV)}}={\frac {1.2398}{\lambda {\text{ (μm)}}}}} since h c / e {\displaystyle hc/e} = 1.239 841 984 ...

× 10 −6 eV⋅m [ 4 ] where h is the Planck constant , c is the speed of light , and e is the elementary charge .

The photon energy of near infrared radiation at 1 μm wavelength is approximately 1.2398 eV.

Examples [ edit ] An FM radio station transmitting at 100 MHz emits photons with an energy of about 4.1357 × 10 −7 eV . This minuscule amount of energy is approximately 8 × 10 −13 times the electron 's mass (via mass–energy equivalence).

Very-high-energy gamma rays have photon energies of 100 GeV to over 1 PeV (10 11 to 10 15 electronvolts) or 16 nJ to 160 μJ.

[ 5 ] This corresponds to frequencies of 2.42 × 10 25 Hz to 2.42 × 10 29 Hz .

During photosynthesis , specific chlorophyll molecules absorb red-light photons at a wavelength of 700 nm in the photosystem I , corresponding to an energy of each photon of ≈ 2 eV ≈ 3 × 10 −19 J ≈ 75 k B T , where k B T denotes the thermal energy. A minimum of 48 photons is needed for the synthesis of a single glucose molecule from CO 2 and water (chemical potential difference 5 × 10 −18 J ) with a maximal energy conversion efficiency of 35%.
