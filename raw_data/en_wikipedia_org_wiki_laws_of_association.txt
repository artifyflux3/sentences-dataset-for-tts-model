Find sources: "Laws of association" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( January 2023 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Laws of association in Aristotle 's psychology. Impressions are stored in the seat of perception , linked by the laws of similarity, contrast, and contiguity.

In psychology , the principal laws of association are contiguity , repetition , attention , pleasure-pain , and similarity .  The basic laws were formulated by Aristotle in approximately 300 B.C. and by John Locke in the seventeenth century.  Both philosophers taught that the mind at birth is a blank slate and that all knowledge has to be acquired by learning.  The laws they taught still make up the backbone of modern learning theory .
