Its curved boundary of length L is a circular arc.

A circular arc is the arc of a circle between a pair of distinct points . If the two points are not directly opposite each other, one of these arcs, the minor arc , subtends an angle at the center of the circle that is less than π radians (180 degrees ); and the other arc, the major arc , subtends an angle greater than π radians. The arc of a circle is defined as the part or segment of the circumference of a circle. A straight line that connects the two ends of the arc is known as a chord of a circle. If the length of an arc is exactly half of the circle, it is known as a semicircular arc .

Length [ edit ] See also: Arc length § Arcs of circles The length (more precisely, arc length ) of an arc of a circle with radius r and subtending an angle θ (measured in radians) with the circle center — i.e., the central angle — is L = θ θ r .

{\displaystyle L=\theta r.} This is because L c i r c u m f e r e n c e = θ θ 2 π π .

{\displaystyle {\frac {L}{\mathrm {circumference} }}={\frac {\theta }{2\pi }}.} Substituting in the circumference L 2 π π r = θ θ 2 π π , {\displaystyle {\frac {L}{2\pi r}}={\frac {\theta }{2\pi }},} and, with α being the same angle measured in degrees, since θ = ⁠ α / 180 ⁠ π , the arc length equals L = α α π π r 180 .

{\displaystyle L={\frac {\alpha \pi r}{180}}.} A practical way to determine the length of an arc in a circle is to plot two lines from the arc's endpoints to the center of the circle, measure the angle where the two lines meet the center, then solve for L by cross-multiplying the statement: measure of angle in degrees/360° = L /circumference.

For example, if the measure of the angle is 60 degrees and the circumference is 24 inches, then 60 360 = L 24 360 L = 1440 L = 4.

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\frac {60}{360}}&={\frac {L}{24}}\\[6pt]360L&=1440\\[6pt]L&=4.\end{aligned}}} This is so because the circumference of a circle and the degrees of a circle, of which there are always 360, are directly proportional.

The upper half of a circle can be parameterized as y = r 2 − − x 2 .

{\displaystyle y={\sqrt {r^{2}-x^{2}}}.} Then the arc length from x = a {\displaystyle x=a} to x = b {\displaystyle x=b} is L = r [ arcsin ⁡ ⁡ ( x r ) ] a b .

{\displaystyle L=r{\Big [}\arcsin \left({\frac {x}{r}}\right){\Big ]}_{a}^{b}.} Sector area [ edit ] Main article: Circular sector § Area The area of the sector formed by an arc and the center of a circle (bounded by the arc and the two radii drawn to its endpoints) is A = r 2 θ θ 2 .

{\displaystyle A={\frac {r^{2}\theta }{2}}.} The area A has the same proportion to the circle area as the angle θ to a full circle: A π π r 2 = θ θ 2 π π .

{\displaystyle {\frac {A}{\pi r^{2}}}={\frac {\theta }{2\pi }}.} We can cancel π on both sides: A r 2 = θ θ 2 .

{\displaystyle {\frac {A}{r^{2}}}={\frac {\theta }{2}}.} By multiplying both sides by r 2 , we get the final result: A = 1 2 r 2 θ θ .

{\displaystyle A={\frac {1}{2}}r^{2}\theta .} Using the conversion described above, we find that the area of the sector for a central angle measured in degrees is A = α α 360 π π r 2 .

{\displaystyle A={\frac {\alpha }{360}}\pi r^{2}.} Segment area [ edit ] The area of the shape bounded by the arc and the straight line between its two end points is 1 2 r 2 ( θ θ − − sin ⁡ ⁡ θ θ ) .

{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}r^{2}(\theta -\sin \theta ).} To get the area of the arc segment , we need to subtract the area of the triangle, determined by the circle's center and the two end points of the arc, from the area A {\displaystyle A} . See Circular segment for details.

Radius [ edit ] The product of the line segments AP and PB equals the product of the line segments CP and PD. If the arc has a width AB and height CP, then the circle's diameter C D = A P ⋅ ⋅ P B C P + C P {\displaystyle CD={\frac {AP\cdot PB}{CP}}+CP} Using the intersecting chords theorem (also known as power of a point or secant tangent theorem) it is possible to calculate the radius r of a circle given the height H and the width W of an arc: Consider the chord with the same endpoints as the arc. Its perpendicular bisector is another chord, which is a diameter of the circle. The length of the first chord is W , and it is divided by the bisector into two equal halves, each with length ⁠ W / 2 ⁠ . The total length of the diameter is 2 r , and it is divided into two parts by the first chord. The length of one part is the sagitta of the arc, H , and the other part is the remainder of the diameter, with length 2 r − H . Applying the intersecting chords theorem to these two chords produces H ( 2 r − − H ) = ( W 2 ) 2 , {\displaystyle H(2r-H)=\left({\frac {W}{2}}\right)^{2},} whence 2 r − − H = W 2 4 H , {\displaystyle 2r-H={\frac {W^{2}}{4H}},} so r = W 2 8 H + H 2 .

{\displaystyle r={\frac {W^{2}}{8H}}+{\frac {H}{2}}.} The arc, chord, and sagitta derive their names respectively from the Latin words for bow, bowstring, and arrow .
