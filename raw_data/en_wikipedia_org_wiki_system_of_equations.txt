An equation system is usually classified in the same manner as single equations , namely as a: System of linear equations , System of nonlinear equations , System of bilinear equations , System of polynomial equations , System of differential equations , or a System of difference equations See also [ edit ] Simultaneous equations model , a statistical model in the form of simultaneous linear equations Elementary algebra , for elementary methods Index of articles associated with the same name This set index article includes a list of related items that share the same name (or similar names).
