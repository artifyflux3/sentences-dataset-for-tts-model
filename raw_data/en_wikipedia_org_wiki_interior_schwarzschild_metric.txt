This is a static solution, meaning that it does not change over time. It was discovered by Karl Schwarzschild in 1916, who earlier had found the exterior Schwarzschild metric .

[ 1 ] Mathematics [ edit ] Spherical coordinates The interior Schwarzschild metric is framed in a spherical coordinate system with the body's centre located at the origin, plus the time coordinate. Its line element is [ 2 ] [ 3 ] c 2 d τ τ 2 = − − 1 4 ( 3 1 − − r s r g − − 1 − − r 2 r s r g 3 ) 2 c 2 d t 2 + ( 1 − − r 2 r s r g 3 ) − − 1 d r 2 + r 2 ( d θ θ 2 + sin 2 ⁡ ⁡ θ θ d φ φ 2 ) , {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}c^{2}\,d\tau ^{2}=&-{\frac {1}{4}}\left(3{\sqrt {1-{\frac {r_{s}}{r_{g}}}}}-{\sqrt {1-{\frac {r^{2}r_{s}}{r_{g}^{3}}}}}\right)^{2}c^{2}\,dt^{2}\\&{}+\left(1-{\frac {r^{2}r_{s}}{r_{g}^{3}}}\right)^{-1}\,dr^{2}+r^{2}(d\theta ^{2}+\sin ^{2}\theta \,d\varphi ^{2}),\end{aligned}}} where τ τ {\displaystyle \tau } is the proper time (time measured by a clock moving along the same world line with the test particle ), c {\displaystyle c} is the speed of light , t {\displaystyle t} is the time coordinate (measured by a stationary clock located infinitely far from the spherical body), r {\displaystyle r} is the Schwarzschild radial coordinate; each surface of constant t {\displaystyle t} and r {\displaystyle r} has the geometry of a sphere with measurable (proper) circumference 2 π π r {\displaystyle 2\pi r} and area 4 π π r 2 {\displaystyle 4\pi r^{2}} (as by the usual formulas), but the warping of space means that the proper distance from each shell to the center of the body is greater than r {\displaystyle r} , θ θ {\displaystyle \theta } is the colatitude (angle from north, in units of radians ), φ φ {\displaystyle \varphi } is the longitude (also in radians), r s {\displaystyle r_{s}} is the Schwarzschild radius of the body, which is related to its mass M {\displaystyle M} by r s = 2 G M / c 2 {\displaystyle r_{s}=2GM/c^{2}} , where G {\displaystyle G} is the gravitational constant (for ordinary stars and planets, this is much less than their proper radius), r g {\displaystyle r_{g}} is the value of the r {\displaystyle r} coordinate at the body's surface; this is less than its proper (measurable interior) radius, although for the Earth the difference is only about 1.4 millimetres.

This solution is valid for r ≤ ≤ r g {\displaystyle r\leq r_{g}} . For a complete metric of the sphere's gravitational field, the interior Schwarzschild metric has to be matched with the exterior one, − − c 2 d τ τ 2 = ( 1 − − r s r ) c 2 d t 2 − − ( 1 − − r s r ) − − 1 d r 2 − − r 2 ( d θ θ 2 + sin 2 ⁡ ⁡ θ θ d φ φ 2 ) , {\displaystyle -c^{2}\,d\tau ^{2}=\left(1-{\frac {r_{s}}{r}}\right)c^{2}\,dt^{2}-\left(1-{\frac {r_{s}}{r}}\right)^{-1}\,dr^{2}-r^{2}(d\theta ^{2}+\sin ^{2}\theta \,d\varphi ^{2}),} at the surface. It can easily be seen that the two have the same value at the surface, i.e., at r = r g {\displaystyle r=r_{g}} .

Other formulations [ edit ] Defining a parameter R 2 = r g 3 / r s {\displaystyle {\mathcal {R}}^{2}=r_{g}^{3}/r_{s}} , we get − − c 2 d τ τ 2 = − − 1 4 ( 3 1 − − r g 2 R 2 − − 1 − − r 2 R 2 ) 2 c 2 d t 2 + ( 1 − − r 2 R 2 ) − − 1 d r 2 + r 2 ( d θ θ 2 + sin 2 ⁡ ⁡ θ θ d φ φ 2 ) .

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}-c^{2}d\tau ^{2}=&-{\frac {1}{4}}\left(3{\sqrt {1-{\frac {r_{g}^{2}}{{\mathcal {R}}^{2}}}}}-{\sqrt {1-{\frac {r^{2}}{{\mathcal {R}}^{2}}}}}\right)^{2}c^{2}\,dt^{2}\\&{}+\left(1-{\frac {r^{2}}{{\mathcal {R}}^{2}}}\right)^{-1}\,dr^{2}+r^{2}(d\theta ^{2}+\sin ^{2}\theta \,d\varphi ^{2}).\end{aligned}}} We can also define an alternative radial coordinate η η = arcsin ⁡ ⁡ r R {\displaystyle \eta =\arcsin {\frac {r}{\mathcal {R}}}} and a corresponding parameter η η g = arcsin ⁡ ⁡ r g R = arcsin ⁡ ⁡ r s r g {\displaystyle \eta _{g}=\arcsin {\frac {r_{g}}{\mathcal {R}}}=\arcsin {\sqrt {\frac {r_{s}}{r_{g}}}}} , yielding [ 4 ] c 2 d τ τ 2 = ( 3 cos ⁡ ⁡ η η g − − cos ⁡ ⁡ η η 2 ) 2 c 2 d t 2 − − d r 2 cos 2 ⁡ ⁡ η η − − r 2 ( d θ θ 2 + sin 2 ⁡ ⁡ θ θ d φ φ 2 ) .

{\displaystyle c^{2}d\tau ^{2}=\left({\frac {3\cos \eta _{g}-\cos \eta }{2}}\right)^{2}c^{2}\,dt^{2}-{\frac {dr^{2}}{\cos ^{2}\eta }}-r^{2}(d\theta ^{2}+\sin ^{2}\theta \,d\varphi ^{2}).} Properties [ edit ] Volume [ edit ] With g r r = ( 1 − − r s r 2 / r g 3 ) − − 1 {\displaystyle g_{rr}=(1-r_{s}r^{2}/r_{g}^{3})^{-1}} and the area A = 4 π π r 2 {\displaystyle A=4\pi r^{2}} , the integral for the proper volume is V = ∫ ∫ 0 r g A g r r d r = 2 π π ( r g 9 / 2 arcsin ⁡ ⁡ r s r g r s 3 / 2 − − r g 4 1 − − r s r g r s ) , {\displaystyle V=\int _{0}^{r_{g}}A{\sqrt {g_{rr}}}\,dr=2\pi \left({\frac {r_{g}^{9/2}\arcsin {\sqrt {\dfrac {r_{s}}{r_{g}}}}}{r_{s}^{3/2}}}-{\frac {r_{g}^{4}{\sqrt {1-{\dfrac {r_{s}}{r_{g}}}}}}{r_{s}}}\right),} which is larger than the volume of a euclidean reference shell.

Density [ edit ] The fluid has a constant density by definition. It is given by ρ ρ = M 4 π π 3 r g 3 = 3 κ κ R 2 , {\displaystyle \rho ={\frac {M}{{\frac {4\pi }{3}}r_{g}^{3}}}={\frac {3}{\kappa {\mathcal {R}}^{2}}},} where κ κ = 8 π π G / c 2 {\displaystyle \kappa =8\pi G/c^{2}} is the Einstein gravitational constant .

[ 3 ] [ 5 ] It may be counterintuitive that the density is the mass divided by the volume of a sphere with radius r g {\displaystyle r_{g}} , which seems to disregard that this is less than the proper radius, and that space inside the body is curved so that the volume formula for a "flat" sphere shouldn't hold at all. However, M {\displaystyle M} is the mass measured from the outside, for example by observing a test particle orbiting the gravitating body (the " Kepler mass"), which in general relativity is not necessarily equal to the proper mass. This mass difference exactly cancels out the difference of the volumes.

Pressure and stability [ edit ] The pressure of the incompressible fluid can be found by calculating the Einstein tensor G μ μ ν ν {\displaystyle G_{\mu \nu }} from the metric. The Einstein tensor is diagonal (i.e., all off-diagonal elements are zero), meaning there are no shear stresses , and has equal values for the three spatial diagonal components, meaning pressure is isotropic . Its value is p = ρ ρ c 2 cos ⁡ ⁡ η η − − cos ⁡ ⁡ η η g 3 cos ⁡ ⁡ η η g − − cos ⁡ ⁡ η η .

{\displaystyle p=\rho c^{2}{\frac {\cos \eta -\cos \eta _{g}}{3\cos \eta _{g}-\cos \eta }}.} As expected, the pressure is zero at the surface of the sphere and increases towards the centre. It becomes infinite at the centre if cos ⁡ ⁡ η η g = 1 / 3 {\displaystyle \cos \eta _{g}=1/3} , which corresponds to r s = 8 9 r g {\displaystyle r_{s}={\frac {8}{9}}r_{g}} or η η g ≈ ≈ 70.5 ∘ ∘ {\displaystyle \eta _{g}\approx 70.5^{\circ }} , which is true for a body that is extremely dense or large. Such a body suffers gravitational collapse into a black hole . As this is a time dependent process, the Schwarzschild solution does not hold any longer.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] Redshift [ edit ] Gravitational redshift for radiation from the sphere's surface (for example, light from a star) is z = 1 cos ⁡ ⁡ η η g − − 1.

{\displaystyle z={\frac {1}{\cos \eta _{g}}}-1.} From the stability condition cos ⁡ ⁡ η η g > 1 / 3 {\displaystyle \cos \eta _{g}>1/3} follows z < 2 {\displaystyle z<2} .

[ 3 ] Visualization [ edit ] Embedding of a Schwarzschild metric's slice in three-dimensional Euclidean space. The interior solution is the darker cap at the bottom.

This embedding should not be confused with the unrelated concept of a gravity well .

The spatial curvature of the interior Schwarzschild metric can be visualized by taking a slice (1) with constant time and (2) through the sphere's equator, i.e.

t = c o n s t .

, θ θ = π π / 2 {\displaystyle t=const.,\theta =\pi /2} . This two-dimensional slice can be embedded in a three-dimensional Euclidean space and then takes the shape of a spherical cap with radius R {\displaystyle {\mathcal {R}}} and half opening angle η η g {\displaystyle \eta _{g}} . Its Gaussian curvature K {\displaystyle K} is proportional to the fluid's density and equals R − − 2 = r s / r g 3 = ρ ρ κ κ / 3 {\displaystyle {\mathcal {R}}^{-2}=r_{s}/r_{g}^{3}=\rho \kappa /3} . As the exterior metric can be embedded in the same way (yielding Flamm's paraboloid ), a slice of the complete solution can be drawn like this: [ 5 ] [ 6 ] In this graphic, the blue circular arc represents the interior metric, and the black parabolic arcs with the equation w = 2 r s ( r − − r s ) {\displaystyle w=2{\sqrt {r_{s}(r-r_{s})}}} represent the exterior metric, or Flamm's paraboloid. The η η {\displaystyle \eta } -coordinate is the angle measured from the centre of the cap, that is, from "above" the slice. The proper radius of the sphere – intuitively, the length of a measuring rod spanning from its centre to a point on its surface – is half the length of the circular arc, or η η g R {\displaystyle \eta _{g}{\mathcal {R}}} .

This is a purely geometric visualization and does not imply a physical "fourth spatial dimension" into which space would be curved. (Intrinsic curvature does not imply extrinsic curvature .) Examples [ edit ] Here are the relevant parameters for some astronomical objects, disregarding rotation and inhomogeneities such as deviation from the spherical shape and variation in density.
