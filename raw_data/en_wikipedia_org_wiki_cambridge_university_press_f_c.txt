They play home matches at the Cass Centre.

History [ edit ] The club was established in 1893, and won its first major trophy, the Cambridgeshire Senior Cup , in 1914. They won Division Two of the Cambridgeshire League in 1928–29, Division One in 1930–31, and the Premier Division in 1934–35.

[ 1 ] Following relegations, in 1967–68, Cambridge University Press won Division 2B. The Cambridgeshire Junior Cup was won in 1986, and Division 2A in 1992–93. They won the Senior B division in 2003–04, and were promoted to the Premier Division in 2004–05 after finishing second in the Senior A division. They won the Premier League Cup in 2007–08. After finishing as runners-up in the Premier Division in 2009–10, the club were promoted to Division One of the Eastern Counties League.

[ 2 ] In 2011 Cambridge University Press moved its home games to Histon 's Bridge Road ground, as they were unable to erect floodlights at the Cass Centre. Despite winning Division One in 2012–13, the club left the league in order to return to the Cass Centre, returning to the Premier Division of the Cambridgeshire League. In 2014–15 they finished second-from-bottom of the Premier Division, [ 3 ] and were relegated to the Senior A Division. The 2016–17 season saw them finish as runners-up in the division, resulting in promotion back to the Premier Division. In 2021–22 the club won the Premier Division Cup, beating Eaton Socon 4–2 on penalties after a 3–3 draw (in which they recovered from being 3–0 down in the 87th minute).

The club withdrew from the Cambridgeshire County League at the end of the 2024–25 season.
