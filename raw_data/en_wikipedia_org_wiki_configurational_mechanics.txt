By contrast, in classical mechanics , reckoning is commonly made from the perspective of spatial coordinates .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Configurational mechanics has been applied to the analysis of crack growth . In these applications, growth of the crack corresponds to a material displacement , and the configurational force causing crack growth emerges as the Energy release rate .
