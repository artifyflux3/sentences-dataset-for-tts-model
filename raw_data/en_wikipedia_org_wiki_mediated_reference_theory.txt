It thus stands opposed to direct reference theory .

Gottlob Frege is a well-known advocate of mediated reference theories.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] Similar theories were widely held in the middle of the twentieth century by philosophers such as Peter Strawson and John Searle .

Saul Kripke , a proponent of direct reference theory, in his Naming and Necessity dubbed mediated reference theory the Frege–Russell view and criticized it.

[ 4 ] Subsequent scholarship refuted the claim that Bertrand Russell 's views on reference theory were the same as Frege's, since Russell was also a proponent of direct reference theory.

One can refer to it, as we might say, directly ."
