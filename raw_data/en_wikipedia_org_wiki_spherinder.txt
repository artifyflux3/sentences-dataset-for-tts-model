In four-dimensional geometry , the spherinder , or spherical cylinder or spherical prism , is a geometric object, defined as the Cartesian product of a 3- ball (or solid 2- sphere ) of radius r 1 and a line segment of length 2 r 2 : D = { ( x , y , z , w ) | x 2 + y 2 + z 2 ≤ ≤ r 1 2 , w 2 ≤ ≤ r 2 2 } {\displaystyle D=\{(x,y,z,w)|x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}\leq r_{1}^{2},\ w^{2}\leq r_{2}^{2}\}} Like the duocylinder , it is also analogous to a cylinder in 3-space, which is the Cartesian product of a disk with a line segment . It is a rotatope and a toratope.

It can be seen in 3-dimensional space by stereographic projection as two concentric spheres, in a similar way that a tesseract (cubic prism) can be projected as two concentric cubes, and how a circular cylinder can be projected into 2-dimensional space as two concentric circles.

Spherindrical coordinate system [ edit ] One can define a "spherindrical" coordinate system ( r , θ , φ , w ) , consisting of spherical coordinates with an extra coordinate w . This is analogous to how cylindrical coordinates are defined: r and φ being polar coordinates with an elevation coordinate z . Spherindrical coordinates can be converted to Cartesian coordinates using the formulas x = r cos ⁡ ⁡ φ φ sin ⁡ ⁡ θ θ y = r sin ⁡ ⁡ φ φ sin ⁡ ⁡ θ θ z = r cos ⁡ ⁡ θ θ w = w {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}x&=r\cos \varphi \sin \theta \\y&=r\sin \varphi \sin \theta \\z&=r\cos \theta \\w&=w\end{aligned}}} where r is the radius, θ is the zenith angle, φ is the azimuthal angle, and w is the height. Cartesian coordinates can be converted to spherindrical coordinates using the formulas r = x 2 + y 2 + z 2 φ φ = arctan ⁡ ⁡ y x θ θ = arccot ⁡ ⁡ z x 2 + y 2 w = w {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}r&={\sqrt {x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}}}\\\varphi &=\arctan {\frac {y}{x}}\\\theta &=\operatorname {arccot} {\frac {z}{\sqrt {x^{2}+y^{2}}}}\\w&=w\end{aligned}}} The hypervolume element for spherindrical coordinates is d H = r 2 sin ⁡ ⁡ θ θ d r d θ θ d φ φ d w , {\displaystyle \mathrm {d} H=r^{2}\sin {\theta }\,\mathrm {d} r\,\mathrm {d} \theta \,\mathrm {d} \varphi \,\mathrm {d} w,} which can be derived by computing the Jacobian .

Measurements [ edit ] Hypervolume [ edit ] Given a spherinder with a spherical base of radius r and a height h , the hypervolume of the spherinder is given by H = 4 3 π π r 3 h {\displaystyle H={\frac {4}{3}}\pi r^{3}h} Surface volume [ edit ] The surface volume of a spherinder, like the surface area of a cylinder, is made up of three parts: the volume of the top base: 4 3 π π r 3 {\textstyle {\frac {4}{3}}\pi r^{3}} the volume of the bottom base: 4 3 π π r 3 {\textstyle {\frac {4}{3}}\pi r^{3}} the volume of the lateral 3D surface: 4 π π r 2 h {\textstyle 4\pi r^{2}h} , which is the surface area of the spherical base times the height Therefore, the total surface volume is S V = 8 3 π π r 3 + 4 π π r 2 h {\displaystyle SV={\frac {8}{3}}\pi r^{3}+4\pi r^{2}h} Proof [ edit ] The above formulas for hypervolume and surface volume can be proven using integration. The hypervolume of an arbitrary 4D region is given by the quadruple integral H = ⨌ ⨌ D d H {\displaystyle H=\iiiint \limits _{D}\mathrm {d} H} The hypervolume of the spherinder can be integrated over spherindrical coordinates.

H s p h e r i n d e r = ⨌ ⨌ D d H = ∫ ∫ 0 h ∫ ∫ 0 2 π π ∫ ∫ 0 π π ∫ ∫ 0 R r 2 sin ⁡ ⁡ θ θ d r d θ θ d φ φ d w = 4 3 π π R 3 h {\displaystyle H_{\mathrm {spherinder} }=\iiiint \limits _{D}\mathrm {d} H=\int _{0}^{h}\int _{0}^{2\pi }\int _{0}^{\pi }\int _{0}^{R}r^{2}\sin {\theta }\,\mathrm {d} r\,\mathrm {d} \theta \,\mathrm {d} \varphi \,\mathrm {d} w={\frac {4}{3}}\pi R^{3}h} Related 4-polytopes [ edit ] The related truncated icosidodecahedral prism is constructed from two truncated icosidodecahedra connected by prisms , shown here in stereographic projection with some prisms hidden.

The spherinder is related to the uniform prismatic polychora , which are Cartesian products of a regular or semiregular polyhedron and a line segment . There are eighteen convex uniform prisms based on the Platonic and Archimedean solids ( tetrahedral prism , truncated tetrahedral prism , cubic prism , cuboctahedral prism , octahedral prism , rhombicuboctahedral prism , truncated cubic prism , truncated octahedral prism , truncated cuboctahedral prism , snub cubic prism , dodecahedral prism , icosidodecahedral prism , icosahedral prism , truncated dodecahedral prism , rhombicosidodecahedral prism , truncated icosahedral prism , truncated icosidodecahedral prism , snub dodecahedral prism ), plus an infinite family based on antiprisms , and another infinite family of uniform duoprisms , which are products of two regular polygons .
