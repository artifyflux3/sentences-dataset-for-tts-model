Latitude 41° 09′ N to 42° 01′ N Longitude 71° 07′ W to 71° 54′ W Website ri .gov Rhode Island ( / ˌ r oʊ d -/ ⓘ ROHD ) [ 6 ] [ 7 ] is a state in the New England region of the Northeastern United States . It borders Connecticut to its west; Massachusetts to its north and east; and the Atlantic Ocean to its south via Rhode Island Sound and Block Island Sound ; and shares a small maritime border with New York , east of Long Island .

[ 8 ] Rhode Island is the smallest U.S. state by area and the seventh-least populous , with slightly more than 1.1 million residents as of 2024 [update] .

[ 9 ] The state's population, however, has continually recorded growth in every decennial census since 1790, and it is the second-most densely populated state after New Jersey . The state takes its name from the eponymous island , though most of its land area is on the mainland.

Providence is its capital and most populous city.

Native Americans lived around Narragansett Bay before English settlers began arriving in the early 17th century.

[ 10 ] Rhode Island was unique among the Thirteen British Colonies in having been founded by a refugee, Roger Williams , who fled religious persecution in the Massachusetts Bay Colony to establish a haven for religious liberty. He founded Providence in 1636 on land purchased from local tribes, creating the first settlement in North America with an explicitly secular government.

[ 10 ] The Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations subsequently became a destination for religious and political dissenters and social outcasts, earning it the moniker "Rogue's Island".

[ 11 ] Rhode Island was the first colony to call for a Continental Congress , in 1774, and the first to renounce its allegiance to the British Crown , on May 4, 1776.

[ 12 ] After the American Revolution , during which it was heavily occupied and contested, Rhode Island became the fourth state to ratify the Articles of Confederation , on February 9, 1778.

[ 13 ] Because its citizens favored a weaker central government, it boycotted the 1787 convention that had drafted the United States Constitution , [ 14 ] which it initially refused to ratify; [ 15 ] it finally ratified it on May 29, 1790, the last of the original 13 states to do so.

[ 16 ] [ 17 ] The state was officially named the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations since the colonial era but came to be commonly known as "Rhode Island". On November 3, 2020, the state's voters approved an amendment to the state constitution formally dropping "and Providence Plantations" from its full name.

[ 18 ] Its official nickname, found on its welcome sign, is the "Ocean State", a reference to its 400 mi (640 km) of coastline and the large bays and inlets that make up about 14% of its area.

[ 19 ] Name [ edit ] Origin of the name [ edit ] Despite its name, most of Rhode Island is on the U.S. mainland. Its official name was State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations from its beginning in 1636 until 2020, and it is referred to in that manner in the United States Constitution .

[ 20 ] This name was derived from the merger of Colonial settlements around Narragansett Bay , and outside the jurisdiction of Plymouth colony. The settlements of Rhode Island ( Newport and Portsmouth ) were on Rhode Island, also known as Aquidneck Island .

[ b ] [ 21 ] Providence Plantations referred to settlements on the mainland of Providence and Warwick .

[ 22 ] It is unclear how the island came to be named Rhode Island , but two historical events may have been influential: Explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano noted the presence of an island near the mouth of Narragansett Bay in 1524 which he likened to the island of Rhodes off the coast of Greece.

[ 23 ] Subsequent European explorers were unable to precisely identify the island Verrazzano described, but the colonists who settled the area assumed that it was this island.

[ c ] Adriaen Block passed by the island during his expeditions in the 1610s, and described it in a 1625 account of his travels as "an island of reddish appearance", which was " een rodlich Eylande " in 17th-century Dutch, meaning a red or reddish island, supposedly evolving into the designation Rhode Island.

[ 24 ] [ 25 ] Historians have theorized that this "reddish appearance" resulted from either red autumn foliage or red clay on portions of the shore.

[ 26 ] The earliest documented use of the name "Rhode Island" for Aquidneck was in 1637 by Roger Williams. The name was officially applied to the island in 1644 with these words: "Aquethneck shall be henceforth called the Isle of Rodes or Rhode-Island." The name "Isle of Rodes" is used in a legal document as late as 1646.

[ 27 ] [ 28 ] Dutch maps as early as 1659 call the island "Red Island" ( Roodt Eylandt ).

[ 29 ] Changes to the name [ edit ] The first English settlement in Rhode Island was the town of Providence, which the Narragansett granted to Roger Williams in 1636.

[ citation needed ] At that time, Williams obtained no permission from the English crown, as he believed the English had no legitimate claim on Narragansett and Wampanoag territory.

[ 30 ] [ verification needed ] Williams traveled to London in 1643, during the English Civil War, to obtain legal recognition of the new settlements. A Patent was granted to "the incorporation of Providence Plantations in Narragansett Bay in New England" by the Parliamentary committee on Foreign Plantations .

[ 31 ] After the English Civil war, a Royal Charter was granted in 1663, giving the colony an official name of the "Governor and Company of the English Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, in New England, in America." [ 32 ] Following the American Revolution , in 1790 the new state incorporated as the "State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations". However, as matter of convenience, the state came to be commonly known as simply "Rhode Island".

The word plantation in the state's name became a contested issue during the 20th century and the increased awareness of slavery and its role in early Rhode Island history. The General Assembly voted in 2009 to hold a referendum in November 2010 on removing "and Providence Plantations" from the official name. Advocates for excising plantation argued that the word symbolized a legacy of disenfranchisement for many Rhode Islanders, as well as the proliferation of slavery in the colonies and in the post-colonial United States. Advocates for retaining the name argued that plantation was simply an archaic synonym for colony and bore no relation to slavery. The people voted overwhelmingly (78% to 22%) to retain the entire original name.

[ 33 ] In June 2020, state senator Harold Metts introduced a resolution for another ballot referendum on the subject, saying, "Whatever the meaning of the term 'plantations' in the context of Rhode Island's history, it carries a horrific connotation when considering the tragic and racist history of our nation." [ 34 ] Governor Gina Raimondo issued an executive order to remove the phrase from a range of official documents and state websites.

[ 35 ] In July, amidst the George Floyd protests and nationwide calls to address systemic racism, the resolution referring the question to the voters was passed by both houses of the Rhode Island General Assembly : 69–1 in the House of Representatives , [ 36 ] and 35–0 in the Senate .

[ 37 ] The change was then approved by voters 52.8% to 47.2% as part of the 2020 United States elections , taking effect in November 2020 upon certification of the results.

[ 18 ] [ 38 ] History [ edit ] Main article: History of Rhode Island Colonial era: 1636–1770 [ edit ] Main article: Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations In 1636, Roger Williams and his followers founded the settlement of Providence Plantations.

At the onset of European colonization what is now Rhode Island was inhabited mainly by five Native American tribes — by far most of the state's territory was inhabited by the Narragansett , eastern borderlands were occupied by the Wampanoag , south-western coast by the Niantic , western borderlands by the Pequot and northern borderlands by the Nipmuc .

[ 39 ] [ self-published source?

] [ 40 ] In 1636, Roger Williams was banished from the Massachusetts Bay Colony for his religious views, and he settled at the top of Narragansett Bay on land sold or given to him by Narragansett sachem Canonicus . He named the site Providence, "having a sense of God's merciful providence unto me in my distress", [ 41 ] and it became a place of religious freedom where all were welcome.

In 1936, on the 300th anniversary of the settlement of Rhode Island in 1636, the U.S. Post Office issued a commemorative stamp, depicting Roger Williams In 1638 (after conferring with Williams), Anne Hutchinson , William Coddington , John Clarke , Philip Sherman , and other religious dissenters were allowed to settle on Aquidneck Island (also known as Rhode Island), by the Narragansett Sachems Canonicus and Miantonomi . They were given a few items in reciprocity for their generosity. However, as Roger Williams made clear in a letter to John Winthrop in June 1638: "Sir, concerning the islands Prudence and…Aquedenick…neither of them were sold properly, for a thousand fathom would not have bought either, by strangers. The truth is, not a penny was demanded for either, and what was paid was only gratuity, though I chose, for better assurance and form, to call it sale." [ 42 ] This settlement was first called Pocasset and then changed in 1639 to Portsmouth . The town was governed by the Portsmouth Compact . The island's southern part became the separate settlement of Newport after disagreements among the founders.

Samuel Gorton purchased lands at Shawomet in 1642 from the Narragansetts, precipitating a dispute with the Massachusetts Bay Colony. In 1644, Providence, Portsmouth, and Newport united for their common independence as the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations , governed by an elected council and "president". Gorton received a separate charter for his settlement in 1648 which he named Warwick after his patron.

[ 43 ] Metacomet was the Wampanoag tribe's war leader, whom the colonists called King Philip. They invaded and burned down several of the towns in the area during King Philip's War (1675–1676), including Providence which was attacked twice.

[ 41 ] A force of Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Plymouth militia under General Josiah Winslow invaded and destroyed the fortified Narragansett Indian village in the Great Swamp in South Kingstown, Rhode Island , on December 19, 1675.

[ 44 ] In one of the final actions of the war, an Indian associated with Benjamin Church killed King Philip in Bristol, Rhode Island .

[ 45 ] In 1680, Newport was the third largest Anglo-American city. It remained a prosperous population center until the 1770s.

[ 46 ] The colony was amalgamated into the Dominion of New England in 1686, as King James II attempted to enforce royal authority over the autonomous colonies in British North America , but the colony regained its independence under the Royal Charter after the Glorious Revolution of 1688. Slaves were introduced in Rhode Island at this time, although there is no record of any law legalizing slave-holding. The colony later prospered under the slave trade, distilling rum to sell in Africa as part of a profitable triangular trade in slaves and sugar with the Caribbean.

[ 47 ] Rhode Island's legislative body passed an act in 1652 abolishing the holding of slaves (the first British colony to do so), but this edict was never enforced and Rhode Island continued to be heavily involved in the slave trade during the post-revolution era.

[ 48 ] In 1774, the slave population of Rhode Island was 6.3% of the total (nearly twice the ratio of other New England colonies).

[ 49 ] [ 50 ] Brown University was founded in 1764 as the College in the British Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations. It was one of nine Colonial colleges granted charters before the American Revolution and was the first college in America to accept students regardless of religious affiliation.

[ 51 ] Revolutionary to Civil War period: 1770–1860 [ edit ] Providence Revolutionaries burned HMS Gaspee in Warwick in protest of British customs laws.

Rhode Island's tradition of independence and dissent gave it a prominent role in the American Revolution . At approximately 2 a.m. on June 10, 1772, a band of Providence residents attacked the grounded revenue schooner HMS Gaspée , burning it to the waterline for enforcing unpopular trade regulations within Narragansett Bay.

[ 52 ] Rhode Island was the first of the thirteen colonies to renounce its allegiance to the British Crown on May 4, 1776.

[ 53 ] It was also the last of the thirteen colonies to ratify the United States Constitution on May 29, 1790, and only under threat of heavy trade tariffs from the other former colonies and after assurances were made that a Bill of Rights would become part of the Constitution.

[ 54 ] A nine-pence banknote issued by Rhode Island in 1786 During the Revolution, the British occupied Newport in December 1776. A combined Franco-American force fought to drive them off Aquidneck Island. Portsmouth was the site of the first African-American military unit, the 1st Rhode Island Regiment , to fight for the U.S. in the unsuccessful Battle of Rhode Island of August 29, 1778.

[ 55 ] A month earlier, the appearance of a French fleet off Newport caused the British to scuttle some of their own ships in an attempt to block the harbor. The British abandoned Newport in October 1779, concentrating their forces in New York City. An expedition of 5,500 French troops under Count Rochambeau arrived in Newport by sea on July 10, 1780.

[ 56 ] The celebrated march to Yorktown, Virginia , in 1781 ended with the defeat of the British at the Siege of Yorktown and the Battle of the Chesapeake .

Rhode Island was also heavily involved in the Industrial Revolution , which began in America in 1787 when Thomas Somers reproduced textile machine plans which he imported from England. He helped to produce the Beverly Cotton Manufactory , in which Moses Brown of Providence took an interest. Moses Brown teamed up with Samuel Slater and helped to create the second cotton mill in America, a water-powered textile mill. The Industrial Revolution moved large numbers of workers into the cities. With the 1663 colonial charter still in effect, voting was restricted to landowners holding at least $134 in property. At the time of the revolution, 80% of White men in Rhode Island could vote; by 1840, only 40% were still eligible.

[ 57 ] The charter apportioned legislative seats equally among the state's towns, over-representing rural areas and under-representing the growing industrial centers. Additionally, the charter disallowed landless citizens from filing civil suits without endorsement from a landowner.

[ 58 ] Bills were periodically introduced in the legislature to expand suffrage, but they were invariably defeated.

In 1841, activists led by Thomas W. Dorr organized an extralegal convention to draft a state constitution, [ 59 ] arguing the charter government violated the Guarantee Clause in Article Four, Section Four of the United States Constitution . In 1842, the charter government and Dorr's supporters held separate elections, and two rival governments claimed sovereignty over the state. Dorr's supporters led an armed rebellion against the charter government, and Dorr was arrested and imprisoned for treason against the state.

[ 60 ] In response, the legislature drafted a state constitution which replaced property requirements for American-born citizens with a $1 poll tax , equivalent to $33 in 2024. In a heavily boycotted election in November 1842, voters approved the constitution.

[ citation needed ] Voters also declined to limit the change to "white" men, thus re-enfranchising Black men—Black men meeting the property requirements had been able to vote in Rhode Island until 1822. The constitution also ended slavery. Immigrants remained subject to the property requirement, effectively disenfranchising many Irish-Americans and maintaining urban under-representation.

[ 61 ] [ 62 ] In 1849, in Luther v. Borden , the US Supreme Court declined to rule on the constitutional question raised in Dorr's rebellion, holding that it was a political question outside its jurisdiction.

In the early 19th century, Rhode Island was subject to a tuberculosis outbreak which led to public hysteria about vampirism .

[ 63 ] [ 64 ] Civil War [ edit ] The United States Naval Academy was moved to Fort Adams in Newport during the Civil War.

Main article: Rhode Island in the American Civil War During the American Civil War , Rhode Island was the first Union state to send troops in response to President Lincoln 's request for help from the states. Rhode Island furnished 23,700 fighting men, of whom 1,685 died.

[ 65 ] On the home front, Rhode Island and the other northern states used their industrial capacity to supply the Union Army with the materials it needed to win the war. The United States Naval Academy moved to Rhode Island temporarily during the war.

In 1866, Rhode Island abolished racial segregation in the public schools throughout the state.

[ 66 ] Gilded Age [ edit ] Interior of The Breakers , a Newport symbol of the Gilded Age The 50 years following the Civil War were a time of prosperity and affluence that author William G. McLoughlin calls "Rhode Island's halcyon era". Rhode Island was a center of the Gilded Age and provided a home or summer home to many of the country's most prominent industrialists. This was a time of growth in textile mills and manufacturing and brought an influx of immigrants to fill those jobs, bringing population growth and urbanization. In Newport , New York's wealthiest industrialists created a summer haven to socialize and build grand mansions . Thousands of French-Canadian, Italian, Irish, and Portuguese immigrants arrived to fill jobs in the textile and manufacturing mills in Providence, Pawtucket, Central Falls, and Woonsocket.

[ 67 ] World War I [ edit ] During World War I, Rhode Island furnished 28,817 soldiers, of whom 612 died. After the war, the state was hit hard by the Spanish Influenza .

[ 68 ] In the 1920s and 1930s, rural Rhode Island saw a surge in Ku Klux Klan membership, largely in reaction to large waves of immigrants moving to the state. The Klan is believed to be responsible for burning the Watchman Industrial School in Scituate , which was a school for African-American children.

[ 69 ] Growth in the modern era: 1929–present [ edit ] Since the Great Depression , the Rhode Island Democratic Party has dominated local politics. Rhode Island has comprehensive health insurance for low-income children and a large social safety net . However, many urban areas still have a high rate of child poverty. Due to an influx of residents from Boston , increasing housing costs have resulted in more homelessness in Rhode Island.

[ 70 ] Downtown Providence in 2008 The 350th anniversary of the founding of Rhode Island was celebrated with a free concert held on the tarmac of the Quonset State Airport on August 31, 1986. Performers included Chuck Berry , Tommy James , and headliner Bob Hope .

Geography [ edit ] Further information: Geology of New England and Climate change in Rhode Island Topographic map of Rhode Island Rhode Island covers an area of 1,034 square miles (2,678 km 2 ) [ 2 ] within the New England region of the Northeastern United States and is bordered on the north and east by Massachusetts, on the west by Connecticut, and on the south by Rhode Island Sound and the Atlantic Ocean.

[ 19 ] It shares a narrow maritime border with New York State between Block Island and Long Island . The state's mean elevation is 200 feet (61 m). It is only 37 miles (60 km) wide and 48 miles (77 km) long, yet the state has a tidal shoreline on Narragansett Bay and the Atlantic Ocean of 384 miles (618 km).

[ 71 ] Rhode Island is nicknamed the Ocean State and has a number of oceanfront beaches . It is mostly flat with no real mountains, and the state's highest natural point is Jerimoth Hill , 812 feet (247 m) above sea level.

[ 72 ] The state has two distinct natural regions. Eastern Rhode Island contains the lowlands of the Narragansett Bay, while Western Rhode Island forms part of the New England upland. Rhode Island's forests are part of the Northeastern coastal forests ecoregion.

[ 73 ] Narragansett Bay is a major feature of the state's topography. There are more than 30 islands within the bay; the largest is Aquidneck Island , which holds the municipalities of Newport, Middletown, and Portsmouth. The second-largest island is Conanicut , and the third is Prudence .

Block Island lies about 12 miles (19 km) off the southern coast of the mainland and separates Block Island Sound and the Atlantic Ocean proper.

[ 74 ] [ 75 ] A rare type of rock called Cumberlandite can be found in Cumberland (the only place within the United States in which it can be found) and is the state rock. There were initially two known deposits of the mineral, but it is an ore of iron, and one of the deposits was extensively mined for its ferrous content.

The basic climate features warm to hot summers and cool winters with a mix of rain and snow.

Block Island has an oceanic climate . The highest temperature recorded in Rhode Island was 104 °F (40 °C), recorded on August 2, 1975, in Providence.

[ 78 ] The lowest recorded temperature in Rhode Island was −23 °F (−31 °C) on February 5, 1996, in Greene .

[ 79 ] Monthly average temperatures range from a high of 83 °F (28 °C) to a low of 20 °F (−7 °C).

[ 80 ] Rhode Island is vulnerable to tropical storms and hurricanes due to its location along the East Coast.  Hurricanes that have done significant damage in the state include the 1938 New England hurricane , Hurricane Carol (1954), Hurricane Donna (1960), and Hurricane Bob (1991).

Due to the relatively flat nature of Rhode Island's seashore, the state is vulnerable to storm surge and coastal erosion, especially as sea levels rise.

Cities and towns [ edit ] Main article: List of municipalities in Rhode Island See also: Rhode Island locations by per capita income and Category:Villages in Rhode Island Rhode Island is divided into five counties but it has no county governments. The entire state is divided into 39 municipalities, which handle all local government affairs.

There are 8 cities and 31 towns in Rhode Island. Major population centers today result from historical factors; development took place predominantly along the Blackstone , Seekonk , and Providence Rivers with the advent of the water-powered mill. Providence is the base of a large metropolitan area .

The state's 19 largest municipalities ranked by population are: [ 81 ] Providence (190,934) Cranston (82,934) Warwick (82,823) Pawtucket (75,604) East Providence (47,139) Woonsocket (43,240) Cumberland (36,405) Coventry (35,688) North Providence (34,114) South Kingstown (31,931) West Warwick (31,012) Johnston (29,568) North Kingstown (27,732) Newport (25,163) Westerly (23,359) Central Falls (22,583) Lincoln (22,529) Bristol (22,493) Smithfield (22,118) Some of Rhode Island's cities and towns are further partitioned into villages, in common with many other New England states. Notable villages include Kingston in the town of South Kingstown, which houses the University of Rhode Island; Wickford in the town of North Kingstown, the site of an annual international art festival; and Wakefield where the Town Hall is for the Town of South Kingstown.

The state capitol building is made of white Georgian marble. On top is the world's fourth largest self-supported marble dome.

[ 83 ] It houses the Rhode Island Charter granted by King Charles II in 1663, the Brown University charter, and other state treasures.

The First Baptist Church of Providence is the oldest Baptist church in the Americas, founded by Roger Williams in 1638.

The first fully automated post office in the country is in Providence. There are many historic mansions in the seaside city of Newport, including The Breakers , Marble House , and Belcourt Castle . Also there is the Touro Synagogue , dedicated on December 2, 1763, considered by locals to be the first synagogue within the United States (see below for information on New York City's claim), and still serving. The synagogue showcases the religious freedoms established by Roger Williams, as well as impressive architecture in a mix of the classic colonial and Sephardic style. The Newport Casino is a National Historic Landmark building complex that houses the International Tennis Hall of Fame and features an active grass-court tennis club.

The Towers are a Narragansett landmark.

Scenic Route 1A (known locally as Ocean Road) is in Narragansett . " The Towers " is also in Narragansett featuring a large stone arch. It was once the entrance to a famous Narragansett casino that burned down in 1900. The Towers now serve as an event venue and host the local Chamber of Commerce, which operates a tourist information center.

The Newport Tower has been hypothesized to be of Viking origin, although most experts believe it was a Colonial-era windmill.

[ 85 ] On May 29, 2014, Governor Lincoln D. Chafee announced that Rhode Island was one of eight states to release a collaborative Action Plan to put 3.3 million zero-emission vehicles on its roads by 2025. The plan's purpose is to reduce greenhouse gas and smog-causing emissions. The plan promotes zero-emissions vehicles and investments in the infrastructure to support them.

[ 86 ] In 2014, Rhode Island received grants of $2,711,685 from the Environmental Protection Agency to clean up Brownfield sites in eight locations. The grants provided communities with funding to assess, clean up, and redevelop contaminated properties, boost local economies, and leverage jobs while protecting public health and the environment.

[ 87 ] In 2013, the "Lots of Hope" program was established in the City of Providence to focus on increasing the city's green space and local food production, improve urban neighborhoods, promote healthy lifestyles and improve environmental sustainability. Supported by a $100,000 grant, the program will partner with the City of Providence, the Southside Community Land Trust, and the Rhode Island Foundation to convert city-owned vacant lots into productive urban farms.

[ 88 ] In 2012, Rhode Island passed bill S2277/H7412, "An act relating to Health and Safety – Environmental Cleanup Objectives for Schools", informally known as the School Siting Bill. Sponsored by Senator Juan Pichardo and Representative Scott Slater , and signed into law by the governor, it made Rhode Island the first US State to prohibit school construction on Brownfield sites where toxic vapors can potentially affect indoor air quality. It also creates a public participation process whenever a city or town considers building a school on any other kind of contaminated site.

[ 89 ] On April 14, 2021, the 2021 Act on Climate was signed. It specified a set of increasingly stringent emissions mandates for the state for the first year of every decade from 2020 until 2050, with the ultimate goal of the state producing net-zero emissions by 2050.

In 2018, The top countries of origin for Rhode Island's immigrants were the Dominican Republic , Guatemala , Portugal , Cape Verde and India .

[ 103 ] Hispanics in the state make up 12.8% of the population, predominantly Dominican, Puerto Rican, and Guatemalan populations.

[ 105 ] The state's most populous ethnic group, non-Hispanic white, has declined from 96.1% in 1970 to 76.5% in 2011.

[ 104 ] [ 106 ] In 2011, 40.3% of Rhode Island's children under the age of one belonged to racial or ethnic minority groups, meaning they had at least one parent who was not non-Hispanic white.

[ 102 ] Rhode Island has some of the highest percentages of Irish Americans and Italian Americans.

[ 108 ] Italian Americans make up a plurality in central and southern Providence County and French-Canadian Americans form a large part of northern Providence County. Irish Americans have a strong presence in Newport and Kent counties. Americans of English ancestry still have a presence in the state as well, especially in Washington County , and are often referred to as " Swamp Yankees ".

Rhode Island has a notable Lusophone community, having a higher percentage of Americans of Portuguese ancestry than any other state, including Portuguese Americans and Cape Verdean Americans . Additionally, the state also has the highest percentage of Liberian immigrants, with more than 15,000 residing in the state.

Religion [ edit ] Religious affiliation per the PRRI (2022) Christian 72% Unaffiliated 24% Jewish 2% Other faiths 2% A Pew survey of Rhode Island residents' religious self-identification in 2014 showed the following distribution of affiliations: Catholic 42%, Protestant 30%, Jewish 1%, Jehovah's Witnesses 2%, Buddhism 1%, Mormonism 1%, Hinduism 1%, and Non-religious 20%.

[ 121 ] The largest Christian denominations as of 2010 were the Catholic Church with 456,598 adherents, the Episcopal Church with 19,377, the American Baptist Churches USA with 15,220, and the United Methodist Church with 6,901 adherents.

[ 122 ] Rhode Island has had the highest proportion of Catholic residents of any state according to a study in 2000, [ 123 ] mainly due to large Irish, Italian, and French-Canadian immigration in the past; recently, significant Portuguese and various Hispanic or Latino communities have also been established in the state. Though it has the highest overall Catholic percentage of any state, none of Rhode Island's individual counties ranks among the 10 most Catholic in the United States, as Catholics are evenly spread throughout the state.

According to the Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI) in 2020, 67% of the population were Christian, spread among evangelical and mainline Protestantism , and Roman Catholicism.

[ 124 ] In 2022, the Public Religion Research Institute revealed 72% of the population were Christian.

[ 125 ] Touro Synagogue in Newport is the oldest existing synagogue building in the United States.

Rhode Island's Jewish community, centered in the Providence area, emerged during a wave of Jewish immigration predominantly from Eastern Europeans shtetls between 1880 and 1920. The presence of the Touro Synagogue in Newport, the oldest existing synagogue in the United States, emphasizes that these second-wave immigrants did not create Rhode Island's first Jewish community; a comparatively smaller wave of Spanish and Portuguese Jews immigrated to Newport during the colonial era. In 2022, they made up 2% of the state's population.

[ 125 ] The religiously unaffiliated since 2014 were 20% of the population, though the separate study by the Public Religion Research Institute determined the irreligious increased to 29% of the adult population.

[ 124 ] In 2022, the religiously unaffiliated declined to 24% of the population.

[ 125 ] Native American tribes [ edit ] Today, many inhabitants of Rhode Island identify as being Native American alone (6,058 people in 2010 census and 7,385 in 2020) or Native American in combination with one or more other races (8,336 people in 2010 census and 15,972 in 2020).

[ 126 ] Many inhabitants of Rhode Island also reported belonging to tribes in 2010 census, the largest of which were the Narragansett (2,820 people), the Cherokee (987), the Wampanoag (559) and the Pequot (424). Other tribes included the Iroquois (278), the Micmac (101), the Abenaki (100), the Nipmuc (99) and more.

[ 127 ] Economy [ edit ] See also: Rhode Island locations by per capita income The Rhode Island economy had a colonial base in fishing.

Slater Mill in Pawtucket is cited as the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution in the United States .

[ 128 ] The Blackstone River Valley was a major contributor to the American Industrial Revolution. It was in Pawtucket that Samuel Slater set up Slater Mill in 1793, [ 129 ] using the waterpower of the Blackstone River to power his cotton mill . For a while, Rhode Island was one of the leaders in textiles. However, with the Great Depression , most textile factories relocated to southern U.S. states. The textile industry still constitutes a part of the Rhode Island economy but does not have the same power.

Other important industries in Rhode Island's past included toolmaking, costume jewelry , and silverware . An interesting by-product of Rhode Island's industrial history is the number of abandoned factories, many of which are now condominiums, museums, offices, and low-income and elderly housing. Today, much of Rhode Island's economy is based on services, particularly healthcare and education, and still manufacturing to some extent.

[ 130 ] The state's nautical history continues in the 21st century in the form of nuclear submarine construction.

Per the 2013 American Communities Survey, Rhode Island has the highest paid elementary school teachers in the country, with an average salary of $75,028 (adjusted to inflation).

[ 131 ] The headquarters of Textron and Citizens Financial Group in downtown Providence The headquarters of Citizens Financial Group , the 14th largest bank in the United States, is in Providence .

[ 132 ] The Fortune 500 companies CVS Caremark and Textron are based in Woonsocket and Providence, respectively.

FM Global , GTECH Corporation , Hasbro , American Power Conversion , Nortek, and Amica Mutual Insurance are all Fortune 1000 companies based in Rhode Island.

[ 133 ] According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis , Rhode Island's gross state product in 2024 was $ 82.5 billion, ranking 44th in the nation.

[ 134 ] Rhode Island's 2000 total gross state production was $46.18 billion (adjusted to inflation), placing it 45th in the nation. Its 2000 per capita personal income was $41,484 (adjusted to inflation), 16th in the nation. Rhode Island has the lowest level of energy consumption per capita of any state.

[ 135 ] [ 136 ] [ 137 ] Additionally, Rhode Island is rated as the 5th most energy efficient state in the country.

[ 138 ] [ 139 ] In December 2012, the state's unemployment rate was 10.2%.

[ 140 ] This has gradually reduced to 3.5% in November 2019, however, the coronavirus pandemic brought the unemployment rate to a high of 18.1% in April 2020. This has since reduced to 10.5% in September 2020 and is projected to further decrease to 7% in October 2020.

[ 141 ] [ 142 ] Health services are Rhode Island's largest industry. Second is tourism, supporting 39,000 jobs, with tourism-related sales at $4.56 billion (adjusted to inflation) in the year 2000. The third-largest industry is manufacturing.

[ 143 ] Its industrial outputs are submarine construction, shipbuilding, costume jewelry, fabricated metal products, electrical equipment, machinery, and boatbuilding. Rhode Island's agricultural outputs are nursery stock, vegetables, dairy products, and eggs. The largest single product is milk , which in 2017 totaled $4,563,000 in sales.

[ 144 ] Rhode Island's taxes were appreciably higher than those of neighboring states, [ 145 ] because Rhode Island's income tax was based on 25% of the payer's federal income tax payment.

[ 146 ] Former governor Donald Carcieri claimed the higher tax rate had an inhibitory effect on business growth in the state and called for reductions to increase the competitiveness of the state's business environment. In 2010, the Rhode Island General Assembly passed a new state income tax structure that Governor Carcieri signed into law on June 9, 2010.

[ 147 ] The income tax overhaul has made Rhode Island competitive with other New England states by lowering its maximum tax rate to 5.99% and reducing the number of tax brackets to three.

[ 148 ] The state's first income tax was enacted in 1971.

[ 149 ] Largest employers [ edit ] As of March 2011 [update] , Rhode Island's largest employers (excluding employees of municipalities) are: [ 150 ] Rank Employer Employees Notes 1 State of Rhode Island 14,904 Full-time equivalents 2 Brown University Health 11,869 Rhode Island Hospital (7,024 employees), The Miriam Hospital (2,410), Newport Hospital (919), Emma Pendleton Bradley Hospital (800), Lifespan Corporate Services (580), Newport Alliance Newport (68), Lifespan MSO (53), and Home Medical (15) 3 U.S. federal government 11,581 Excludes 3,000 active duty military personnel and 7,000 reservists , but includes 250 employees of the Naval War College .

1,780 Transportation [ edit ] Further information: Rhode Island Department of Transportation Bus [ edit ] The Rhode Island Public Transit Authority operates a statewide system of bus transport.

The Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA) operates statewide intra- and intercity bus transport from its hubs at Kennedy Plaza in Providence, Pawtucket , and Newport . RIPTA bus routes serve 38 of Rhode Island's 39 cities and towns. ( New Shoreham on Block Island is not served). RIPTA operates 58 routes, including daytime trolley service (using trolley-style replica buses) in Providence and Newport.

Ferry [ edit ] From 2000 through 2008, RIPTA offered seasonal ferry service linking Providence and Newport (already connected by highway) funded by grant money from the United States Department of Transportation . Though the service was popular with residents and tourists, RIPTA was unable to continue after the federal funding ended. Service was discontinued as of 2010 [update] .

[ 152 ] The service resumed in 2016 and has been successful. The privately run Block Island Ferry [ 153 ] links Block Island with Newport and Narragansett with traditional and fast-ferry service, while the Prudence Island Ferry [ 154 ] connects Bristol with Prudence Island . Private ferry services also link several Rhode Island communities with ports in Connecticut , Massachusetts , and New York.

Rail [ edit ] A southbound Northeast Regional train at Kingston Station See also: List of Rhode Island railroads The MBTA Commuter Rail 's Providence/Stoughton Line links Providence and T. F. Green Airport with Boston's South Station , with an intermediate stop at Pawtucket/Central Falls and several stations in Massachusetts. The line was later extended southward to Wickford Junction , with service beginning April 23, 2012. The state has considered proposals for extending the MBTA line to Kingston and Westerly , as well as explore the possibility of extending Connecticut's Shore Line East to T.F. Green Airport.

[ 155 ] Other proposals have contemplated a light-rail tram or rapid bus transit through: Cumberland, Central Falls, Pawtucket, Providence, Cranston, and Warwick as well.

[ 156 ] [ 157 ] The Federal government's Amtrak Acela Express stops at Providence Station (the only Acela stop in Rhode Island), linking Providence to other cities in the Northeast Corridor . Amtrak's Northeast Regional service makes stops at Providence Station , Kingston , and Westerly .

Rhode Island is one of four states to have high-speed Northeast Corridor tracks capable of 165 mph. This was due to the fact that in the 1990s, Amtrak upgraded the NEC north of New Haven, CT to get it ready for the high-speed Acela Express trains and to extend electrified Northeast Corridor services to Boston.

[ 158 ] Aviation [ edit ] See also: Aviation in Rhode Island and List of airports in Rhode Island Rhode Island's primary airport for passenger and cargo transport is T. F. Green Airport in Warwick , though Rhode Islanders who wish to travel internationally on direct flights and those who seek a greater availability of flights and destinations often fly through Logan International Airport in Boston.

Limited access highways [ edit ] The Jamestown Verrazzano Bridge (foreground) and Claiborne Pell Newport Bridge (background) Interstate 95 (I-95) runs southwest to northeast across the state, linking Rhode Island with other states along the East Coast .

I-295 functions as a partial beltway encircling Providence to the west.

I-195 provides a limited-access highway connection from Providence (and Connecticut and New York via I-95) to Cape Cod. Initially built as the easternmost link in the (now cancelled) extension of I-84 from Hartford, Connecticut , a portion of U.S. Route 6 (US 6) through northern Rhode Island is limited-access and links I-295 with downtown Providence.

Several Rhode Island highways extend the state's limited-access highway network.

Route 4 is a major north–south freeway linking Providence and Warwick (via I-95) with suburban and beach communities along Narragansett Bay .

Route 10 is an urban connector linking downtown Providence with Cranston and Johnston .

Route 37 is an important east–west freeway through Cranston and Warwick and links I-95 with I-295.

Route 99 links Woonsocket with Providence (via Route 146 ). Route 146 travels through the Blackstone Valley , linking Providence and I-95 with Worcester, Massachusetts and the Massachusetts Turnpike .

Route 403 links Route 4 with Quonset Point .

Several bridges cross Narragansett Bay connecting Aquidneck Island and Conanicut Island to the mainland, most notably the Claiborne Pell Newport Bridge and the Jamestown-Verrazano Bridge .

Bicycle paths [ edit ] The East Bay Bike Path in Riverside The East Bay Bike Path stretches from Providence to Bristol along the eastern shore of Narragansett Bay, while the Blackstone River Bikeway will eventually link Providence and Worcester. In 2011, Rhode Island completed work on a marked on-road bicycle path through Pawtucket and Providence, connecting the East Bay Bike Path with the Blackstone River Bikeway, completing a 33.5 miles (54 km) bicycle route through the eastern side of the state.

[ 159 ] The William C. O'Neill Bike Path (commonly known as the South County Bike Path) is an 8 mi (13 km) path through South Kingstown and Narragansett. The 19 mi (31 km) Washington Secondary Bike Path stretches from Cranston to Coventry, and the 2 mi (3.2 km) Ten Mile River Greenway path runs through East Providence and Pawtucket.

Future [ edit ] In late 2019, the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority released a draft of the Rhode Island Transit Master Plan, documenting and describing a variety of proposed improvements and additions to be made to the state's public transit network by 2040. Several different proposals were offered and still under consideration as of December 2020, [ 160 ] including implementation of a bus rapid transit system, express bus routes, expansion of Amtrak and MBTA services throughout the state, and construction of a new light rail network through downtown Providence.

[ 163 ] Many Rhode Islanders distinguish a strong aw sound [ɔə] (i.e., resist the cot–caught merger of Boston) much like one might hear in New Jersey or New York City; for example, the word coffee is pronounced [ˈkʰɔəfi] .

[ 164 ] Rhode Islanders sometimes refer to drinking fountains as "bubblers", milkshakes as "cabinets", and overstuffed foot-long sandwiches (of whatever kind) as "grinders".

The state voted for the Republican presidential candidate until 1908 . Since then, it has voted for the Republican nominee for president seven times, and the Democratic nominee 17 times. The last 16 presidential elections in Rhode Island have resulted in the Democratic Party winning the Ocean State's Electoral College votes 12 times. In the 1980 presidential election , Rhode Island was one of six states to vote against Republican Ronald Reagan . Reagan was the last Republican to win any of the state's counties in a Presidential election until Donald Trump won Kent County in 2016. In 1988, George H. W. Bush won over 40% of the state's popular vote, something no Republican has done since.

Rhode Island was the Democrats' leading state in 1960, 1964, 1968, 1988 and 2000, and second-best in 1968, 1972, 1996, and 2004. Rhode Island's most one-sided Presidential election result was in 1964, with over 80% of Rhode Island's votes going for Lyndon B. Johnson . In 2004, Rhode Island gave John Kerry more than a 20-percentage-point margin of victory (the third-highest of any state), with 59.4% of its vote. All but three of Rhode Island's 39 cities and towns voted for the Democratic candidate. The exceptions were East Greenwich, West Greenwich, and Scituate.

[ 206 ] In 2008, Rhode Island gave Barack Obama a 28-percentage-point margin of victory (the third-highest of any state), with 63% of its vote. All but one of Rhode Island's 39 cities and towns voted for the Democratic candidate (the exception being Scituate).

[ 207 ] In a 2020 study, Rhode Island was ranked as the 19th easiest state for citizens to vote in.

[ 208 ] Party registration as of June 2025: [ 209 ] Party Total voters Percentage Unaffiliated 369,484 49.53% Democratic 267,947 35.91% Republican 108,531 14.54% Total 745,962 100.00% Legislation and taxes [ edit ] Rhode Island is one of 21 states that have abolished capital punishment; it was second do so, just after Michigan , and carried out its last execution in the 1840s. Rhode Island was the second to last state to make prostitution illegal. Until November 2009 Rhode Island law made prostitution legal provided it took place indoors.

[ 210 ] In a 2009 study Rhode Island was listed as the 9th safest state in the country.

[ 211 ] In 2011, Rhode Island became the third state in the United States to pass legislation to allow the use of medical marijuana. On May 25, 2022, Rhode Island fully legalized recreational use of marijuana, becoming the nineteenth state to do so.

[ 212 ] Additionally, the Rhode Island General Assembly passed legislation that allowed civil unions which Governor Lincoln Chafee signed into law on July 2, 2011. Rhode Island became the eighth state to fully recognize either same-sex marriage or civil unions.

[ 213 ] Same-sex marriage became legal on May 2, 2013, and took effect August 1.

[ 214 ] Rhode Island has some of the highest taxes in the country, particularly its property taxes, ranking seventh in local and state taxes, and sixth in real estate taxes.
