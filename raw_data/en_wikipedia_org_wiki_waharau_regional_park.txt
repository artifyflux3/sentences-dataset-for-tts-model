It is just south of the border with the Auckland Region , and is owned and operated by Auckland Council .

[ 2 ] It runs from the eastern side of the Hunua Ranges , where it adjoins Hunua Ranges Regional Park, down to the Firth of Thames coast.

History [ edit ] The southern edge of the park is Waihihi Bay, which was a landing site of the Tainui migratory waka. Settled for a prolonged period during the pre-colonial era, Waharau was renowned for known for its paper mulberry (aute) and karaka groves.

[ 3 ] Since the 17th century, Waharau has been settled by the Ngāti Puku hapū of Ngāti Whanaunga .

[ 3 ] From the 1860s, the area was a site of kauri tree logging by early European settlers.

[ 3 ] The area was purchased by the Auckland Regional Authority between 1970 and 1973, in order to provide vehicle access to the eastern water catchment of the Hunua Ranges . It was later developed into a regional park, and opened by Te Atairangikaahu , the Māori queen , in 1979.
