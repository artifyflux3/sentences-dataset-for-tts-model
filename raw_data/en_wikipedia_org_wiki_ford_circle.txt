Circles with q ≤ 10 are labelled as ⁠ p / q ⁠ and color-coded according to q . Each circle is tangent to the base line and its neighboring circles. Irreducible fractions with the same denominator have circles of the same size.

In mathematics , a Ford circle is a circle in the Euclidean plane , in a family of circles that are all tangent to the x {\displaystyle x} -axis at rational points. For each rational number p / q {\displaystyle p/q} , expressed in lowest terms, there is a Ford circle whose center is at the point ( p / q , 1 / ( 2 q 2 ) ) {\displaystyle (p/q,1/(2q^{2}))} and whose radius is 1 / ( 2 q 2 ) {\displaystyle 1/(2q^{2})} . It is tangent to the x {\displaystyle x} -axis at its bottom point, ( p / q , 0 ) {\displaystyle (p/q,0)} . The two Ford circles for rational numbers p / q {\displaystyle p/q} and r / s {\displaystyle r/s} (both in lowest terms) are tangent circles when | p s − − q r | = 1 {\displaystyle |ps-qr|=1} and otherwise these two circles are disjoint.

[ 1 ] History [ edit ] Ford circles are a special case of mutually tangent circles; the base line can be thought of as a circle with infinite radius. Systems of mutually tangent circles were studied by Apollonius of Perga , after whom the problem of Apollonius and the Apollonian gasket are named.

[ 2 ] In the 17th century René Descartes discovered Descartes' theorem , a relationship between the reciprocals of the radii of mutually tangent circles.

[ 2 ] Ford circles also appear in the Sangaku (geometrical puzzles) of Japanese mathematics . A typical problem, which is presented on an 1824 tablet in the Gunma Prefecture , covers the relationship of three touching circles with a common tangent . Given the size of the two outer large circles, what is the size of the small circle between them? The answer is equivalent to a Ford circle: [ 3 ] 1 r middle = 1 r left + 1 r right .

{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{\sqrt {r_{\text{middle}}}}}={\frac {1}{\sqrt {r_{\text{left}}}}}+{\frac {1}{\sqrt {r_{\text{right}}}}}.} Ford circles are named after the American mathematician Lester R. Ford, Sr.

, who wrote about them in 1938.

[ 1 ] Properties [ edit ] Comparison of Ford circles and a Farey diagram with circular arcs for n from 1 to 9. Note that each arc intersects its corresponding circles at right angles. In the SVG image, hover over a circle or curve to highlight it and its terms.

The Ford circle associated with the fraction p / q {\displaystyle p/q} is denoted by C [ p / q ] {\displaystyle C[p/q]} or C [ p , q ] .

{\displaystyle C[p,q].} There is a Ford circle associated with every rational number . In addition, the line y = 1 {\displaystyle y=1} is counted as a Ford circle – it can be thought of as the Ford circle associated with infinity , which is the case p = 1 , q = 0.

{\displaystyle p=1,q=0.} Two different Ford circles are either disjoint or tangent to one another. No two interiors of Ford circles intersect, even though there is a Ford circle tangent to the x -axis at each point on it with rational coordinates. If p / q {\displaystyle p/q} is between 0 and 1, the Ford circles that are tangent to C [ p / q ] {\displaystyle C[p/q]} can be described variously as the circles C [ r / s ] {\displaystyle C[r/s]} where | p s − − q r | = 1 , {\displaystyle |ps-qr|=1,} [ 1 ] the circles associated with the fractions r / s {\displaystyle r/s} that are the neighbors of p / q {\displaystyle p/q} in some Farey sequence , [ 1 ] or the circles C [ r / s ] {\displaystyle C[r/s]} where r / s {\displaystyle r/s} is the next larger or the next smaller ancestor to p / q {\displaystyle p/q} in the Stern–Brocot tree or where p / q {\displaystyle p/q} is the next larger or next smaller ancestor to r / s {\displaystyle r/s} .

[ 1 ] If C [ p / q ] {\displaystyle C[p/q]} and C [ r / s ] {\displaystyle C[r/s]} are two tangent Ford circles, then the circle through ( p / q , 0 ) {\displaystyle (p/q,0)} and ( r / s , 0 ) {\displaystyle (r/s,0)} (the x-coordinates of the centers of the Ford circles) and that is perpendicular to the x {\displaystyle x} -axis (whose center is on the x-axis) also passes through the point where the two circles are tangent to one another.

The centers of the Ford circles constitute a discrete (and hence countable) subset of the plane, whose closure is the real axis - an uncountable set.

Ford circles can also be thought of as curves in the complex plane . The modular group of transformations of the complex plane maps Ford circles to other Ford circles.

[ 1 ] Ford circles are a sub-set of the circles in the Apollonian gasket generated by the lines y = 0 {\displaystyle y=0} and y = 1 {\displaystyle y=1} and the circle C [ 0 / 1 ] .

{\displaystyle C[0/1].} [ 4 ] By interpreting the upper half of the complex plane as a model of the hyperbolic plane (the Poincaré half-plane model ), Ford circles can be interpreted as horocycles .
In hyperbolic geometry any two horocycles are congruent . When these horocycles are circumscribed by apeirogons they tile the hyperbolic plane with an order-3 apeirogonal tiling .

Total area of Ford circles [ edit ] There is a link between the area of Ford circles, Euler's totient function φ φ , {\displaystyle \varphi ,} the Riemann zeta function ζ ζ , {\displaystyle \zeta ,} and Apéry's constant ζ ζ ( 3 ) .

{\displaystyle \zeta (3).} [ 5 ] As no two Ford circles intersect, it follows immediately that the total area of the Ford circles { C [ p , q ] : 0 < p q ≤ ≤ 1 } {\displaystyle \left\{C[p,q]:0<{\frac {p}{q}}\leq 1\right\}} is less than 1. In fact the total area of these Ford circles is given by a convergent sum, which can be evaluated. From the definition, the area is A = ∑ ∑ q ≥ ≥ 1 ∑ ∑ ( p , q ) = 1 1 ≤ ≤ p < q π π ( 1 2 q 2 ) 2 .

{\displaystyle A=\sum _{q\geq 1}\sum _{(p,q)=1 \atop 1\leq p<q}\pi \left({\frac {1}{2q^{2}}}\right)^{2}.} Simplifying this expression gives A = π π 4 ∑ ∑ q ≥ ≥ 1 1 q 4 ∑ ∑ ( p , q ) = 1 1 ≤ ≤ p < q 1 = π π 4 ∑ ∑ q ≥ ≥ 1 φ φ ( q ) q 4 = π π 4 ζ ζ ( 3 ) ζ ζ ( 4 ) , {\displaystyle A={\frac {\pi }{4}}\sum _{q\geq 1}{\frac {1}{q^{4}}}\sum _{(p,q)=1 \atop 1\leq p<q}1={\frac {\pi }{4}}\sum _{q\geq 1}{\frac {\varphi (q)}{q^{4}}}={\frac {\pi }{4}}{\frac {\zeta (3)}{\zeta (4)}},} where the last equality reflects the Dirichlet generating function for Euler's totient function φ φ ( q ) .

{\displaystyle \varphi (q).} Since ζ ζ ( 4 ) = π π 4 / 90 , {\displaystyle \zeta (4)=\pi ^{4}/90,} this finally becomes A = 45 2 ζ ζ ( 3 ) π π 3 ≈ ≈ 0.872284041.

{\displaystyle A={\frac {45}{2}}{\frac {\zeta (3)}{\pi ^{3}}}\approx 0.872284041.} Note that as a matter of convention, the previous calculations excluded the circle of radius 1 2 {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}} corresponding to the fraction 0 1 {\displaystyle {\frac {0}{1}}} . It includes the complete circle for 1 1 {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{1}}} , half of which lies outside the unit interval, hence the sum is still the fraction of the unit square covered by Ford circles.

Ford spheres (3D) [ edit ] Ford spheres above the complex domain The concept of Ford circles can be generalized from the rational numbers to the Gaussian rationals , giving Ford spheres. In this construction, the complex numbers are embedded as a plane in a three-dimensional Euclidean space , and for each Gaussian rational point in this plane one constructs a sphere tangent to the plane at that point. For a Gaussian rational represented in lowest terms as p / q {\displaystyle p/q} , the diameter of this sphere should be 1 / 2 q q ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle 1/2q{\bar {q}}} where q ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle {\bar {q}}} represents the complex conjugate of q {\displaystyle q} . The resulting spheres are tangent for pairs of Gaussian rationals P / Q {\displaystyle P/Q} and p / q {\displaystyle p/q} with | P q − − p Q | = 1 {\displaystyle |Pq-pQ|=1} , and otherwise they do not intersect each other.
