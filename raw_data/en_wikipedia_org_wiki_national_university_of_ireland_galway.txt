The university was founded in 1845 as Queen's College, Galway . It was known as "University College, Galway" (UCG) ( Irish : Coláiste na hOllscoile, Gaillimh ) from 1908 to 1997 and as "National University of Ireland Galway" (NUI Galway) ( Irish : Ollscoil na hÉireann Gaillimh; OÉ Gaillimh ) from 1997 to 2022. In September 2022, it changed its name to "Ollscoil na Gaillimhe - University of Galway".

[ 5 ] The University of Galway is a member of the Coimbra Group , a network of 40 long-established European universities.

History [ edit ] The university was established in 1845 as Queen's College, Galway, together with Queen's College, Cork , and Queen's College, Belfast . It opened for teaching on 30 October 1849 with 68 students.

[ 6 ] In 1850, it became part of the Queen's University of Ireland , and its degrees were conferred in the name of that university.

[ 7 ] The Quadrangle Building Located close to the city centre, the university campus stretches along the River Corrib . The oldest part of the university, the Quadrangle with its Aula Maxima , was designed by John Benjamin Keane in a Tudor Gothic architectural style and was constructed from local limestone; it is a replica of Christ Church , one of the colleges at the University of Oxford .

[ 8 ] The Queen's University was dissolved on 3 February 1882 under the University Education (Ireland) Act 1879, and was replaced by the Royal University of Ireland (RUI), which had been established on 27 April 1880.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] Under the Irish Universities Act 1908 , the RUI was dissolved and was replaced by the National University of Ireland (NUI) and Queen's University of Belfast (QUB). The name of Queen's College, Galway, was changed to University College, Galway (UCG), and it became a constituent college of the new National University of Ireland, together with University College Dublin (UCD), and University College Cork (UCC). Queen's College, Belfast, became an independent university, called the Queen's University of Belfast.

[ 11 ] [ 6 ] University College, Galway (UCG), was given special statutory responsibility under the University College Galway Act 1929 with respect of the use of the Irish language as a working language of the university.

[ 12 ] Members of the Franciscan Order from St. Anthony's College would have studied for degrees in UCG, [ 13 ] similarly members of the Society of African Missions at their House of Philosophy, at Cloughballymore, Kilcolgan, Co Galway, studied for degrees in UCG. St. Anthony's is now used by the economics department.

Several new buildings were constructed on the university campus in the 1970s and were designed by architects Scott Tallon Walker . The 1990s also saw considerable development, including the conversion of an old munitions factory into a student centre. Under the early 21st-century Presidency of Iognáid G. Ó Muircheartaigh , the university announced details of plans to make the university a "campus of the future" at a cost of around €400 million.

[ 14 ] Ó Muircheartaigh's successor James J. Browne continued and implemented that plan.

[ 15 ] Under the Universities Act 1997, the name of University College, Galway, was changed to National University of Ireland, Galway (NUI Galway), and it became a university in its own right, as a constituent university of the National University of Ireland (NUI).

[ 16 ] [ 6 ] The university had hoped to change its name to University of Galway, but had received legal advice that this was not possible under the provisions of the Act.

[ 17 ] [ 18 ] Visiting the university in 2003, on what was to be his last visit to Ireland, Nelson Mandela condemned U.S. foreign policy and received an honorary doctorate from the NUI Chancellor, Garret FitzGerald .

[ 19 ] [ 20 ] 21st-century developments include a state-of-the-art University Sports Centre ( Ionad Spóirt ), Áras Moyola, J.E. Cairnes School of Business & Economics, the Alice Perry Engineering Building, the BioSciences Research Building, the Life Course Institute, the Lambe Institute and the O'Donoghue Centre for Drama, Theatre and Performance, and the Human Biology Building.

[ 21 ] In 2014, the Equality Tribunal ruled in favor of Dr Micheline Sheehy Skeffington, granddaughter of the famous Irish feminist couple Hannah Sheehy Skeffington and Francis Sheehy Skeffington , who claimed she had been discriminated against on the grounds of gender during 2009.  The university "unreservedly" accepted the decision that the "hiring process was flawed".

[ 22 ] [ 23 ] In 2015 with "widespread concern" among staff, mandatory unconscious bias training was introduced for senior staff, including heads of school and interview boards.

[ 24 ] In 2017 Dr Elizabeth Tilley was deemed to have exceeded qualifications for senior lectureship following a Labour Court hearing and promoted.

[ 25 ] In 2017, the gender ratio of senior lecturers in the university was 60:40 in favour of men. The ratio of professorships, the most senior academic grade, was 87:13 in favor of men.

[ 26 ] In 2018 the university achieved bronze status [ 27 ] in the Athena SWAN [ 28 ] recognises a commitment to advancing gender equality in higher education and research careers. In 2018 a further four female lecturers who had also applied for promotion in 2009 were promoted having settled their cases "amicably".

[ 29 ] [ 30 ] The university launched its Strategic Plan "Shared Vision, Shaped By Values" (for the period 2020–2025) in 2020. Also in 2020, the university was awarded €4 million from the EU's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation programme to support its Solar2chem project.

[ 31 ] In April 2022, it was announced that NUI Galway would be renamed "Ollscoil na Gaillimhe – University of Galway" in summer 2022, amid confusion over its proper title.

[ 32 ] On 1 September 2022, the university changed its name to the "University of Galway".

[ 5 ] This change took legal effect in February 2024.

[ 33 ] Bilingual status [ edit ] Under the University College Galway Act, 1929 (which came into effect on 17 December 1929), the university was given special statutory responsibility with respect of the use of the Irish language as a working language of the university.

[ 34 ] The Act of 1929 provided that when recruiting a person to work for the university, a person competent in the Irish language must be appointed to the position unless no such person with the necessary competence to carry out the role could be found among the candidates for the position. As a result, every president appointed to the university thereafter was fluent in Irish. The university's governing authority complained that this requirement limited the pool of potential candidates for the office of president (in particular, candidates from overseas). As a result, the Act was amended in 2006 to replace the requirement for fluency in the Irish language amongst staff and management with a commitment to provide for education through the Irish language. In 2016, the university amended its recruitment criteria to allow for the possibility of a non-Irish-speaking president.

[ 35 ] In August 2025, a non-Irish-speaking president was appointed to the university for the first time since the appointment of Alexander Anderson in 1899.

[ 36 ] Colleges and schools [ edit ] Up until 2007, the university was divided into seven faculties (Arts, Celtic Studies, Commerce, Law, Medicine and Health Sciences, and Science), which were further subdivided into some 69 departments.

[ 37 ] In 2007–2008, the university transitioned from the faculties and departments structure to a structure of five colleges divided into various schools.

[ 38 ] Áras Moyola, which houses the School of Nursing and Midwifery, the School of Political Science and Sociology and the School of Health Sciences St Anthony's, which houses part of the JE Cairnes School of Business & Economics Alice Perry Engineering Building, which houses the College of Science and Engineering The following are the current colleges and schools of the university: [ 39 ] College of Arts, Social Sciences and Celtic Studies Acadamh na hOllscolaíochta Gaeilge School of Political Science and Sociology School of Psychology School of Education School of Geography, Archaeology and Irish Studies School of English, Media and Creative Arts School of History and Philosophy School of Languages, Literatures and Cultures College of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences School of Health Sciences School of Medicine School of Nursing and Midwifery Adult Learning and Professional Development College of Business, Public Policy and Law JE Cairnes School of Business and Economics School of Law Shannon College of Hotel Management College of Science and Engineering School of Biological and Chemical Sciences School of Computer Science School of Engineering School of Mathematical and Statistical Sciences School of Natural Sciences Since 2015 the Shannon College of Hotel Management has been fully incorporated into the university — becoming part of the College of Business, Public Policy & Law at Galway — formally marked by the then Minister for Education and Skills Jan O'Sullivan at an event held in Shannon College on 9 November 2015. All staff of Shannon College of Hotel Management became staff of the university and all students of Shannon College of Hotel Management became students of the university.

GUMS, the university musical society, hosts annual musicals in the Dubhlann/Black Box Theatre.

[ 60 ] In 2014, the Christian and LGBT societies were involved in a showdown over same-sex marriage .

[ 61 ] The incident was provoked by the auditor of the Christian Society, running for the position of Equality Officer in that year's student union election.

[ 62 ] Earlier, in the late part of 2013, the university suspended the Legion of Mary Society after it failed to satisfactorily explain its connection to posters containing information on a Christian support group for homosexual persons.

[ 63 ] An Cumann Gaelach and An Cumann Drámaíochta are the university's main Irish language societies, following the demise of the Cumann Craic.

[ 64 ] Clubs [ edit ] University of Galway has more than 40 sports clubs based on campus, ranging from indoor sports (such as archery , badminton , fencing , weightlifting , table tennis , and squash ), to water sports (such as rowing , kayaking , sailing , windsurfing , and scuba diving ), as well as martial arts (such as judo , karate , aikido , Muay Thai , kendo , and taekwondo ), plus equestrian , triathlon , athletics, and snow sports.

Connacht Rugby [ edit ] In 2013, the university announced it would sponsor Connacht Rugby , the nearby professional Pro12 (now URC ) rugby union team, for the following three years and would put in place a "High Performance Education Partnership" that would give players from the Connacht Rugby Academy and age-grade teams the chance to educated there. At the time of the announcement 17 members of Connacht's squad were either attending the university as students or were graduates.

[ 67 ] Within a few years of the start of the university's sponsorship of the Connacht Rugby Academy, the team had won, what was then the 2015–16 Pro12 title, for the first time by defeating Leinster in the 2016 Pro12 Grand Final . Seven players from the Connacht Rugby Academy played 55 times for their team during that campaign, with others in that squad also graduates of the Connacht Rugby Academy.

[ 68 ] The deal was renewed in 2017, covering the period until 2019.

[ 69 ] Students' Union [ edit ] Main article: University of Galway Students' Union The Students' Union's primary role is to provide a recognised representative channel between undergraduates and the university and college authorities.

In February 2009, the university announced the Students' Union-run RAG Week would "no longer form part of the university calendar". The President of the Students' Union expressed the belief that the decision was unjustified, citing the more than €20,000 raised for charities that year.

Developing partnerships with sports organisations, particularly at elite level, will be a key component of the strategy, with the success of Connacht Rugby in winning the Guinness Pro12 title in May - the province's first trophy in its 131 year history - a good example of what can be achieved. NUI Galway is the main sponsor of the Connacht Rugby Academy, which has helped develop players for the professional game over the last few years. Seven players from the academy last season - Sean O'Brien, Peter Robb, Conor McKeon, Conan O'Donnell, James Connolly, Shane Delahunt and Rory Parata - played 55 times for Connacht during that historic Pro12 campaign, while several other members of the squad were academy graduates. Many of the academy players also study at NUI Galway, while there are a number of areas where the University and Connacht Rugby exchange expertise.
