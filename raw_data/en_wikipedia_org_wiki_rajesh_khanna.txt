Regarded as one of the greatest and most successful actors in the history of Indian cinema , he is considered the first Superstar of Hindi cinema .

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] His accolades include five Filmfare Awards , and in 2013, he was posthumously awarded the Padma Bhushan , India's third highest civilian honour.

Khanna made his acting debut in 1966 with Aakhri Khat , which was India's first official Academy Awards entry in 1967.

[ 10 ] Khanna died on 18 July 2012, after a period of illness.

[ 11 ] He has been honoured with a stamp and statue in his likeness, and a road renamed after him by the Prime Minister of India .

Early life and background [ edit ] Rajesh Khanna was born on 29 December 1942, in Amritsar , in the Punjab Province of British India (now in Punjab, India ), [ 1 ] as 'Jatin Khanna' into a Punjabi Hindu Khatri family.

[ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] He was adopted and raised by Chunnilal Khanna and Leelawati Khanna, [ 16 ] who were relatives of his biological parents.

Khanna's biological parents were Lala Hiranand Khanna and Chandrani Khanna. His father had migrated from the Vehari District in West Punjab (now in Pakistan ) to Gali Tiwarian in Amritsar . Lala worked as headmaster of the MC High School in Burewala .

[ 17 ] [ 18 ] His adoptive parents belonged to a family of railway contractors who had moved from Lahore to Bombay in 1935.

[ 19 ] Khanna lived in Saraswati Niwas [ 20 ] in Thakur-dwar, near Girgaon , Mumbai.

Khanna attended St. Sebastian's Goan High School with his friend Ravi Kapoor, who later took the stage name Jeetendra .

[ 21 ] Khanna gradually started taking an interest in theatre, did many stage and theatre plays in his school and college days, and won many prizes in inter-college drama competitions.

[ 22 ] In 1962 Khanna played a wounded mute soldier in the play Andha Yug and impressed with his performance; the chief guest suggested that he get into films soon.

[ 23 ] Khanna became a rare newcomer who had his own MG sports car , who once struggled to get work in theatre and films in the early 1960s.

[ 24 ] Khanna did his first two years of Bachelor of Arts at Nowrosjee Wadia College in Pune from 1959 to 1961.

[ 25 ] He later studied at Kishinchand Chellaram College , Mumbai and Jeetendra studied at Siddharth Jain College. Khanna tutored Jeetendra for his first film audition. Khanna's uncle KK Talwar changed Khanna's first name to Rajesh when he decided to enter films.

[ 26 ] His friends and his wife called him Kaka (meaning a baby faced boy in Punjabi).

[ 27 ] Acting career [ edit ] Early works (1966–1968) [ edit ] Rajesh Khanna was one of eight finalists from more than 10,000 contestants in the 1965 All India Talent Contest, organised by United Producers and Filmfare, along with other FTII students Subhash Ghai and Dheeraj Kumar .

[ 28 ] [ 29 ] Khanna won the contest along with Farida Jalal .

[ 30 ] BR Chopra , Bimal Roy , GP Sippy , HS Rawail , Nasir Husain , J.Om Prakash , Mohan Saigal, Shakti Samanta and Subodh Mukherji and others had created the United Producers organisation and were then judges of the contest.

[ 19 ] He made his film debut in the 1966 film Aakhri Khat , directed by Chetan Anand , followed by Raaz (1967), directed by Ravindra Dave , both of which were a part of his predetermined prize for winning the All-India United Producers' Talent Competition.

[ 31 ] G.P. Sippy and Nasir Hussain were the first to sign Khanna after he won the contest.

[ 32 ] "Though 'Aakhri Khat' is my first film, I received my first break as a leading actor in Ravindra Dave's, 'Raaz', in 1967. My heroine was Babita, already a popular actress then. Though I had lots of confidence, I was shy in facing the camera initially. In my first three shots, I had to perform with stress on my body language and dialogue delivery. Though I was right with my dialogues, my movements were not up to the mark. Ravindra Dave explained me my scenes and movements very clearly correcting my way of walking." Khanna's remarks after Aakhri Khat was India's entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 40th Oscar Academy Awards in 1967.

[ 33 ] Being under contract with United Producers, he got projects, such as Aurat (1967) and Baharon Ke Sapne (1967), of which latter did break even and the former was commercially successful.

[ 34 ] [ 35 ] Superstardom (1969–1975) [ edit ] The year 1969 proved to be a game changer for Khanna and saw his rise to superstardom.

[ 36 ] It began with Shakti Samanta 's romantic musical Aradhana starring Sharmila Tagore .

[ 37 ] The film went to become a massive blockbuster at the box office and made him an overnight sensation.

[ 38 ] Its soundtrack composed by S. D. Burman and lyrics written by Anand Bakshi was the third best-selling Hindi film album of the 1960s and made Kishore Kumar the leading playback singer of Hindi cinema .

[ 39 ] [ 40 ] That same year, he starred in Raj Khosla 's romantic family drama Do Raaste opposite Mumtaz .

[ 41 ] Backed up with chartbuster songs, including "Yeh Reshmi Zulfen", "Bindiya Chamkegi", "Chup Gaye Saare Nazaare", it went a step ahead and emerged an All Time Blockbuster , in turn making Khanna and Mumtaz a hit pair.

[ 42 ] [ 43 ] In the United Kingdom , the film was released in 1970. It became the first Indian film to gross £100,000 in the UK, equivalent to ₹ 900,000 (US$118,940.64). Its UK box office record was broken a year later by Purab Aur Paschim , which released in the UK in 1971.

[ 44 ] The huge box office success of Aradhana and Do Raaste was followed by a superhit in Narendra Bedi 's romantic drama Bandhan again with Mumtaz, a hit in Yash Chopra 's songless mystery thriller Ittefaq co-starring Nanda , followed by another successful film, Doli alongside Babita to go with the major grossers.

[ 45 ] These films turned Khanna into a Superstar and marked the beginning of Rajesh Khanna Mania of the early-1970s.

[ 46 ] [ 26 ] He continued his domination at the box office in 1970 and 1971 with films, such as – The Train , Sachaa Jhutha , Safar , Aan Milo Sajna , Kati Patang , Mehboob Ki Mehndi , Anand , Andaz , Maryada , Haathi Mere Saathi , Chhoti Bahu and Khamoshi , eventually giving 17 consecutive successes in a span of three years, a record which remains unbroken to date.

[ 47 ] Khanna won his first Filmfare Award for Best Actor for playing a double role in Sachaa Jhutha .

[ 48 ] He won his second Filmfare Award for Best Actor and first BFJA Award for Best Actor (Hindi) for portraying a cancer-patient in Anand which is also considered his career-best performance by many of his fans as well as critics.

[ 49 ] Khanna began the next year with Dulal Guha 's drama film Dushmun .

[ 50 ] It opened to excellent audience response and emerged a blockbuster as well as one of the highest-earning films of the year .

[ 51 ] Dushmun was later remade in Tamil , Telugu , Malayalam and Kannada .

[ 52 ] [ 53 ] For portraying a rash truck driver in the film, Khanna received a nomination in the Filmfare Award for Best Actor category.

[ 54 ] His next release, the action drama Apna Desh also performed very well at the box office and added one more superhit in his kitty.

[ 55 ] It also had some highly popular songs like "Duniya Mein Logon Ko", "Kajra Lagake Gajra Sajake", "Ro Na Kabhi Nahin Rona".

[ 56 ] In the late 1972, Khanna's amazing run came to an abrupt halt with release of Badnaam Farishte. As per the book The Most Versatile Superstar Actor of Hindi Cinema, he had 10 hits in 1972 which included Shehzada , Mere Jeevan Saathi , Bawarchi , Apna Desh , Amar Prem , Joroo Ka Ghulam , Bangaru Babu , Anuraag . However the last release Maalik was box office flop.

[ 57 ] Out of them, Hrishikesh Mukherjee 's musical comedy drama Bawarchi is regarded as a cult classic today and was remade in many Indian languages, including Hindi itself.

[ 58 ] It also won Khanna his second BFJA Award for Best Actor (Hindi) .

[ 59 ] In 1973, his first release was Sachin Bhowmick 's romantic drama Raja Rani in which he starred alongside his Aradhana co-star Sharmila Tagore [ 60 ] which ended up as a commercially successful venture.

[ 61 ] Khanna then played a brief role in Samanta's Anuraag , which went on to become a blockbuster and won him Filmfare Special Award .

[ 62 ] [ 63 ] After this, he reunited with Tagore for Yash Chopra's maiden production and sixth directional venture Daag: A Poem of Love which also had Rakhee in the lead.

[ 64 ] Inspired from Thomas Hardy 's novel The Mayor of Casterbridge , it was a major critical and commercial success, eventually emerging a blockbuster and laying the foundation of Yash Raj Films (which is the biggest production house in India till today).

[ 65 ] [ 66 ] Its soundtrack composed by Laxmikant–Pyarelal dominated the musical charts and was one of the best-selling Hindi film albums of the 1970s.

[ 67 ] His final release that year was the social drama film Namak Haraam , which too received positive reception and proved to be a superhit at the box office.

[ 68 ] [ 69 ] Khanna received his fifth nomination in the best actor category at the Filmfare Awards for Daag and won his third BFJA Award for Best Actor (Hindi) for Namak Haraam . 1974 was a great year for Khanna with both critical and commercial appreciation coming his way. His first film Humshakal did not do well, but his second release Aap Ki Kasam which was also J. Om Prakash 's debut as a filmmaker proved to be a superhit.

[ 70 ] All of its songs were major hits too, especially "Zindagi Ke Safar Mein Guzar Jate Hain Jo Maqaam" sung by Kishore Kumar.

[ 71 ] This was followed by Prem Nagar which was a remake of Akkineni Nageswara Rao 's all time Telugu hit Prema Nagar (1971).

[ 72 ] Prem Nagar like the original opened to excellent response from the audience, eventually doing more business than Khanna's last major hit Aap Ki Kasam and emerging a blockbuster.

[ 2 ] [ 62 ] Basu Bhattacharya 's art-house film Avishkaar and Shakti Samanta's crime thriller Ajanabee were his next two releases.

[ 73 ] [ 74 ] Both Ajanabee and Avishkaar did reasonable business, the later again opposite Sharmila Tagore earned huge critical acclaim and won Khanna his third and final Filmfare Award for Best Actor for his subtle portrayal of a disillusioned husband.

[ 75 ] His last film of the year was Manmohan Desai 's action drama Roti which released alongside another biggie Roti Kapada Aur Makaan , but still went on to become a blockbuster.

[ 62 ] Due to its huge success, Roti was also remade in Telugu as Neram Nadi Kadu Akalidi (1976).

[ 76 ] Career downfall (1976–1983) [ edit ] The declaration of emergency in 1975 had angered the masses and this helped films having the lead character revolting against corruption and establishment to become successes.

[ 77 ] The shift from romantic and social movies to action oriented multi-starrers changed the box office equation and saw the emergence of another rival Superstar in the form of Amitabh Bachchan .

[ 78 ] When coincidentally some of his good films faced commercial failures, Khanna suffered a major career setback from 1976 to 1978.

[ 79 ] [ 80 ] In 1975, Khanna starred alongside Shashi Kapoor and Mumtaz in Raj Khosla's Prem Kahani and did a guest appearance in the war film Aakraman .

[ 81 ] [ 82 ] The former emerged a box office hit, but his contemporaries, including Bachchan, Dharmendra and Manoj Kumar had bigger hits in their kitty with Sholay , Deewaar , Pratiggya and Sanyasi , which were also among the top 5 highest-grossing films of the year.

[ 83 ] [ 84 ] The following year, he reunited with Hema Malini for Shakti Samanta's highly anticipated romantic drama Mehbooba based on Gulshan Nanda 's novel Sisakate Saaz .

[ 85 ] In spite of impressive performances by the lead pair and two hit songs, "Mere Naina Sawan Bhadon" and "Parbat Ke Peeche", the film ended up as average hit.

[ 2 ] [ 86 ] [ 87 ] This was followed by another moderate fare in Narendra Bedi's action comedy Maha Chor opposite Neetu Singh and a flop in Shammi Kapoor 's romantic comedy Bundal Baaz co-starring Sulakshana Pandit .

[ 87 ] In 1977, Khanna's first release was again a Shakti Samanta directional Anurodh .

[ 88 ] Its soundtrack composed by Laxmikant–Pyarelal topped the year-end annual list of Binaca Geetmala , but commercially the film was an average runner.

[ 89 ] [ 90 ] His next five releases, included - Din Dayal Sharma's Tyaag , Joy Mukherjee 's Chhailla Babu , B.R. Chopra 's Karm , Bhappi Sonie 's Chalta Purza and Meraj's Palkon Ki Chhaon Mein . While Tyaag and Palkon Ki Chhaon Mein didn't do well, Chhailla Babu , Karm and Chalta Purza proved to be decent box office successes.

[ 90 ] Before the end of year, he appeared in another of J. Om Prakash's directional Aashiq Hoon Baharon Ka , which was highly anticipated before release, but flopped commercially.

[ 90 ] Comeback, and further works as a lead (1983–1991) [ edit ] The next year, he had four releases, out of which, Ramanand Sagar 's romantic drama film Prem Bandhan , Muqabla , Amardeep , proved to be a successful venture, but Naya Bakra and Janta Hawaldar were commercial failures.

[ 2 ] In 1979, Khanna appeared alongside Shabana Azmi and Vinod Mehra in the romantic drama Amar Deep .

[ 91 ] The film opened to positive response from critics and emerged a hit at the box office thus ending his dry run and also proving to be one of the highest-grossing films of that year.

[ 92 ] He began the 1980s with Bharathiraja 's psychological thriller Red Rose .

[ 93 ] A remake of blockbuster Tamil film Sigappu Rojakkal , the film couldn't repeat the success of original and flopped commercially.

[ 94 ] His next release was Esmayeel Shroff 's family drama Thodisi Bewafaii opposite Shabana Azmi .

[ 95 ] It performed well at the box office and proved to be a hit with Khanna receiving his 12th nomination in the Filmfare Award for Best Actor category and Kishore Kumar winning Filmfare Award for Best Male Playback Singer for the song "Hazaar Rahen Mud Ke Dekhin".

[ 96 ] [ 97 ] His other releases of the year were - Anil Ganguly 's drama film Aanchal , Danny Denzongpa 's horror thriller Phir Wahi Raat and K. Bapaiah 's romantic drama Bandish .

[ 98 ] [ 99 ] [ 100 ] While Phir Wahi Raat and Bandish were super-hits, Aanchal was a major commercial success.

[ 96 ] In 1981, he co-starred alongside Raaj Kumar , Vinod Khanna , Hema Malini and Priya Rajvansh in Chetan Anand's reincarnation drama Kudrat .

[ 2 ] In spite of presence of some of the biggest stars of that time and its soundtrack being one of the best-selling Hindi film albums of the 1980s, Kudrat was  proved to be a superhit.

[ 101 ] [ 102 ] Khanna's next release, Dard again with Malini and Dhanwan opposite Reena Roy were hits.

[ 2 ] His final release of the year, Shomu Mukherjee 's Fiffty Fiffty co-starring Tina Munim also performed moderately well.

[ 109 ] After almost a decade of occasional success, Khanna made a notable comeback in 1983.

[ 116 ] The film went on to become a superhit and also one of the best-selling Hindi film albums of the 1980s.

[ 111 ] [ 101 ] Khanna completed his hat-trick with another hit in Lekh Tandon 's Agar Tum Na Hote .

[ 117 ] With three back-to-back hits in 1983, he proved that audience still adored him.

[ 35 ] His good run continued in 1984 with a huge hit in K. Bapaiah 's action comedy film Maqsad , which also had Jeetendra , Jaya Prada and Sridevi in the lead, followed by two more successes in Naya Kadam and Dharm Aur Qanoon .

[ 127 ] In 1991, Khanna had three releases – Begunaah , Rupaye Dus Karod and Ghar Parivar , all of which did well commercially.

[ 2 ] Sabbatical, work in television and later career (1992–2012) [ edit ] He quit acting for sometime in 1992, to focus on his political career.

[ 128 ] From 1992 to 1998, he had only two releases - Khudai (1994), which was a film released directly in Zee TV and the much delayed Sautela Bhai (1996), which became an average hit in 1996.

[ 135 ] It was panned by critics across the board and was a box office flop.

[ 136 ] [ 137 ] Khanna appeared in a rare interview in the show Aap Ki Adalat in 1992, where he quoted to the interviewer Rajat Sharma , "I would just ask if I am arrogant, how come all these producers made so many films with me. My fans who turned this actor into a superstar would have never accepted me if I was arrogant. If I was arrogant people would not have made me a Lok Sabha member because if someone is arrogant, that arrogance is visible. And this public knows everything and understand everything".

His successful TV serial Raghukul Reet Sada Chali Aayi began in November 2008 and ended in September 2009.

[ 143 ] Khanna cited the lack of good roles for actors like him in films as the reason for him not appearing much in films after 2001. He said in an interview on being queried about his decision to do TV serials: "The reach of TV is much more than cinema today and one episode of my serial is likely to be watched by more people than a super-hit film".

[ 171 ] [ 172 ] A textbook prescribed by the Mumbai University contained an essay, "The Charisma of Rajesh Khanna!" [ 173 ] Khanna acted alongside Mumtaz in ten films. She stated "I would pull his leg and tease him about his fan following. Whenever Rajesh entered a hotel in Madras , there was a queue of 600 girls waiting to see him at midnight. As a result, even I would get some importance, as people would ask for my autograph as well. He was very generous with his associates." [ 174 ] During the peak of his career, he would be mobbed during public appearances. Fans kissed his car, which would be covered with lipstick marks, and lined the road, cheering and chanting his name. Female fans sent him letters written in their blood.

[ 175 ] Actor Mehmood parodied him in Bombay to Goa where the driver and conductor of the bus were called 'Rajesh' and 'Khanna' respectively. A scene of Amar Prem , to be shot at Howrah Bridge , was cancelled due to his popularity.

[ 176 ] Film critic Monojit Lahiri said: "Girls married themselves to photographs of Khanna, cutting their fingers and applying the blood as sindoor. He was God, there has never been such hysteria." [ 177 ] Several songs sung by Kishore Kumar in the 1970s were based on Khanna. In the 1970s, his chemistry with Sharmila Tagore , Mumtaz, Asha Parekh , Zeenat Aman , Tanuja and Hema Malini were popular with the audience.

[ 178 ] Sharmila Tagore , with whom he made the best onscreen pairing, said in an interview to The Indian Express that "women came out in droves to see Kaka . They would stand in queues outside the studios to catch a glimpse. He needed police protection when he was in public. I have never seen anything like this before or since." [ 179 ] Music remained one of the biggest attractions of his career. Khanna used to personally sit in music sessions with music directors and used to be personally present for recording of songs picturised on him.

Kamal in an interview, narrated his experience of Khanna's stardom, in an incident in 1985 – "He probably hadn't been to a public theatre since he became a star. When we reached, things were okay. He enjoyed the film ( The Swarm ) and refused to leave until the end titles. That's when I panicked. This was Rajesh Khanna, the star of the millennium. All hell broke loose as audiences realised he was there, his shirt was torn, but he was enjoying himself thoroughly. He giggled and chuckled like a child." [ 187 ] Shah Rukh Khan idolised Khanna and has opined; "Rajesh Khanna, you can't touch".

[ 188 ] Anupam Kher said "Kishore Kumar, Sanjeev Kumar , S. D. Burman, R. D. Burman, Rajesh Khanna and Smita Patil changed the face of Indian cinema. They're remembered by the films that they did." [ 189 ] Actor Tom Alter confessed "I still dream of being Rajesh Khanna. For me, in the early 1970s, he was the only hero – romantic to the core, not larger than life, so Indian and real – he was my hero; the reason I came into films and he still is." [ 190 ] Actor Irrfan Khan stated in an interview, "The kind of craze witnessed by Rajesh Khanna has not been duplicated by anyone. He was the biggest and the most real star Bollywood has produced. I'd say stardom is that feeling of being possessed by your idol; you are so overwhelmed with euphoria you lose touch with reality." [ 191 ] The trend of wearing guru kurtas and belts on shirts became famous because of Khanna.

[ 192 ] Actor Salman Khan has stated: "I, Shahrukh or Aamir have not even achieved 10% of what Khanna had in acting or his stardom."

[ 230 ] While Shahid Kapoor quoted: "RIP to the First King of Romance ... Rajesh Khanna." Subhash Ghai added that Khanna " was the powerhouse of the Hindi film industry.

[ 232 ] Vyjayanthimala commented that "His death is a big loss to the industry. It's my bad luck that I didn't have the chance to work with him because he came much later.

[ 233 ] Manna Dey said: "He was a great actor, truly a superstar, no doubt about it. I am honoured to have done playback for him. I have worked for him in several movies, and actors like him are a rarity." [ 234 ] Mrinal Sen recollected how Khanna had wanted to cast him in one of his films, but the latter could not manage due to date problems. "We had met several times. Once I had wanted to cast him in one of my films, but somehow that didn't work out due to his date problems." Film historian S. M. M. Ausaja added: "He never acted in a Bengali cinema . But right from the late 1960s to the 70s he was the top star and worked with the top directors of his era, most of whom were Bengalis."

[ 237 ] Buddhadeb Dasgupta said Khanna's acting would continue to inspire young actors in the future. "He was a great actor and was the first superstar. He was a much bigger star than Amitabh Bachchan . His acting will continue to inspire young actors of the coming generations." [ 238 ] Rituparno Ghosh said: "In the film 'Anand', he delivered some of Indian cinema's most memorable dialogues. The use of the word 'Babu Moshai' by Rajesh Khanna to Amitabh Bachchan , who played a Bengali doctor in the film, is so deeply etched in the minds of Indians that it has almost become a synonym for Bengalis for the rest of the countrymen. "In a dhoti and kurta, you showed the rest of India how truly elegant Bengal was" [ 235 ] Madhur Bhandarkar said, "The epitome of superstardom is no more amongst us. There was none, there is none and there won't be any like you, Kakaji."

So many fond memories from his movies and songs.", while Syed Noor said: "Rajesh Khanna was such a huge actor of the subcontinent that he will be remembered by the people for many years to come. The era he reigned over is unlikely to be experienced by any other actor of this subcontinent." Geo TV also aired a nearly hour-long tribute with contributions from actors, filmmakers and musicians.
