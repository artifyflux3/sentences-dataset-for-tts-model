( June 2025 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) The three spheres of sustainability Sustainability studies is an academic discipline that examines sustainability through an interdisciplinary lens. Programs include instruction in sustainable development , geography , agriculture , environmental policies , ethics , ecology , landscape architecture , urban planning , regional planning , economics , natural resources , sociology , and anthropology .

[ 1 ] Numerous universities offer degree programs in sustainability studies, focusing on interdisciplinary approaches to address environmental challenges .

[ 2 ] History [ edit ] Origins of sustainability studies [ edit ] Early ideas of sustainability revolved around preventing overexploitation .  The Industrial Revolution increased the demand for raw material and energy due to scaled manufacturing and mass production. Resources such as coal, oil, and iron were extracted from the natural environment with little to no regulation. This led to ecological damage and was a concern of early environmental advocates.

[ 3 ] Early conservation groups, like the National Audubon Society and the Sierra Club , were founded in the late nineteenth century to protect wildlife and wildlands.

[ 4 ] The Lacey Act of 1900 , the first federal wildlife protection law in the United States, was passed soon after.

[ 5 ] As environmentalism spread in the early twentieth century, more laws and regulations were introduced for environmental protection. Advocates like Gene Stratton-Porter spoke about preservation and sustainability.

[ 6 ] Meanwhile, scientists like George Washington Carver and Marie Curie discovered more sustainable agricultural and energy production methods.

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] Conservation was also a concern of United States president Theodore Roosevelt , who established multiple government-protected National Parks and Reserves. Roosevelt protected about 230 million acres of land and inspired more concern about the natural world.

[ 9 ] Towards the end of the 1980s, environmental concerns and ecological sustainability saw an increase in global attention.

[ 10 ] The Brundtland Commission , chaired by Norway’s Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland , [ 11 ] was appointed in 1983 to study the consequences of global environmental change.

[ 12 ] In 1987, the commission delivered the Brundtland Report , which introduced the concept of sustainable development, which was defined as "development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs".

[ 12 ] [ 13 ] Five years after the report was published, the 1992 UN Earth Summit in Rio adopted the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).

[ 11 ] In 1997, this framework contributed to the creation of the Kyoto Protocol , an agreement for wealthy nations to reduce their carbon emissions.

[ 11 ] All countries that participated in the UNFCCC also signed the Kyoto Protocol. However, the United States did not subsequently ratify the Kyoto Protocol. Canada withdrew in 2011, and some other nations did not meet their pledges in the agreement.

[ 11 ] [ 14 ] In 2015, the UN outlined seventeen Sustainable Development Goals , with a target achievement date of 2030.

Development of the field [ edit ] While numerous definitions have been proposed [ 15 ] , researchers have suggested that sustainability assessments should fulfill certain criteria: integrate economic, environmental, social, and institutional issues while considering their interdependencies; consider the long-term consequences of present actions; acknowledge uncertainties concerning the result of present actions and act with precautionary bias; engage the public; and include equity considerations both within and between generations.

[ 16 ] Spheres of sustainability [ edit ] Sustainability consists of three major dimensions: the social sphere , the economic sphere , and the environmental sphere. These three spheres are also referred to as the "triple bottom line" or the three pillars of sustainability.

[ 17 ] While distinct, they represent interconnected aspects affecting societal well-being and environmental health. Some scholars and sustainability professionals describe sustainability as being achieved when the three spheres are in balance.

[ citation needed ] Social sphere: The social sphere addresses issues that affect human populations and examines negative human activities that affect society.

[ 18 ] Social issues include food insecurity or shortages, housing costs, (extreme) poverty, healthcare, and access to proper education. Equity and equal access to opportunities are crucial considerations within the social sphere.

[ 19 ] This sphere involves subject fields such as sociology , psychology , and anthropology . Nonprofit and government organizations are often central to the social sphere, with policies aimed at social sustainability often seeking to represent all populations and ensure that all human rights are met.

[ 19 ] Economic sphere: The economic sphere focuses on economical performance and activity in an area, with consumerism often central to this dimension. Individuals, countries, and organizations working in business or finance are included in this sphere. In the context of sustainable development, businesses are encouraged to establish efficient practices and policies for development and growth that limit potential risks to the environment of the planet.

[ 18 ] Environmental sphere: The environmental sphere promotes the health of the physical biosphere. This dimension evaluates environmental issues and proposes solutions to problems that could be implemented at any level, ranging from small-scale to global challenges. Examples of environmental issues include natural disasters (e.g., earthquakes, volcanic eruptions), pollution, energy resources, and deforestation of extensive primary rainforests, such as the Amazon Rainforest . Scientists and activists involved in environmental protection are closely associated with this sphere.

[ 18 ] Sustainability is an interdisciplinary subject, and these three spheres are often represented as overlapping entities ( Venn diagrams ). The intersection of the social and economic spheres relates to concepts such as social justice . The intersection of the economic and environmental spheres gives rise to the subject of environmental stewardship . Finally, environmental justice is a concept that arises from the intersection of the environmental and social spheres.

[ 20 ] Social justice [ edit ] Main article: Social justice Social justice in the context of sustainability seeks to ensure equitable opportunities and living conditions, while also promoting economic stability. Key issues within social justice include the allocation of funding for welfare programs and balancing the support of citizens with the efficient functioning of government. Another prominent concern involves workers' rights, with policies on safe working conditions and fair wages aiming to ensure the ethical treatment of labor. For instance, fair trade certification on products serves to verify that the resources used in their production comply with specific ethical standards.

Environmental stewardship [ edit ] Main article: Environmental stewardship Environmental stewardship involves collaboration between businesses and environment-centered initiatives. Practices associated with environmental stewardship aim to benefit the environment and can sometimes result in cost savings for businesses. Organizations may seek to reduce waste by switching from plastic to paper packaging or recycling unused products. Businesses might also look for ways to manage energy more efficiently, such as using a renewable energy source rather than nonrenewable , and limiting production during peak energy demand periods.

[ 21 ] Environmental justice [ edit ] Main article: Environmental justice Environmental justice is the intersection between social and environmental issues; it examines how environmental issues and protections disproportionately affect different populations.

[ 22 ] Climate change events like natural disasters, increased temperatures, and unpredictable weather patterns can disproportionately impact lower-income and impoverished communities, which often lack the resources to move away from affected neighborhoods. An example of an environmental justice issue in the United States is the lack of properly working septic tanks in Lowndes County, Alabama. In her book Waste: A Woman's Fight Against America's Dirty Secret , Catherine Coleman Flowers discusses the environmental issues this impoverished community faces. In this predominantly African American area, many residents live with raw sewage in their backyards because they cannot afford to buy or install a septic system. Furthermore, these residents can be criminally charged for not having working septic tanks, even though they may not have the means to repair them. Coleman Flowers and other environmental justice advocates have advocated for justice for the residents of Lowndes County .

[ 23 ] A key concern in environmental justice is the impact that climate change events have on developing nations. Former Irish President Mary Robinson published "Climate Justice," a book that shares stories of people in countries around the world addressing climate change. Robinson presents the story of Constance Okollet, a resident of Uganda, who faces regular seasons of floods and droughts, making food and clean water difficult to obtain. An activist from Vietnam, Vu Thi Hien, shares the impacts that war and deforestation have had on her country's land and people. The former president of Kiribati, Anote Tong , has considered relocating the entire nation because of rising sea levels. Robinson's book presents case studies from developing nations to highlight the disparate global impacts of climate change.

[ 24 ] Careers in sustainability studies [ edit ] Sustainability studies emphasize an interdisciplinary approach to environmental problems, drawing from fields such as: Law Politics Policy and planning Journalism Business and Architectural design Marine sciences Sustainability professionals Urban planning Agriculture [ 25 ] Pharmaceutical industry Herbal medicine Salaries for sustainability professionals in the United States have risen significantly since 2017. As of 2024, sustainability specialists and managers typically earn between $85,000 and $115,000 per year, while chief sustainability executives (such as Chief Sustainability Officers) average between $180,000 and $230,000 [ 26 ] , with top-tier compensation packages reaching even higher. Entry-level roles, such as sustainability analysts or coordinators, generally offer salaries ranging from $60,000 to $85,000 [ 27 ] . These increases reflect the heightened importance of ESG initiatives and sustainability leadership in various industries.

Criticism [ edit ] The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have been criticized for being overly broad, difficult to quantify, and at times internally inconsistent. Critics contend that tensions can arise between socio-economic development objectives and environmental sustainability goals, complicating both implementation and monitoring. Furthermore, the SDGs are non-binding, with ambiguous financial commitments and divergent national strategies. Some analyses suggest that while environmental policies are vital, developed countries may need to place greater emphasis on social and environmental dimensions, whereas developing nations might initially prioritize economic and social development efforts.
