There are two hexagons and one heptagon on each vertex , forming a pattern similar to a conventional soccer ball ( truncated icosahedron ) with heptagons in place of pentagons . It has Schläfli symbol of t{3,7}.

Hyperbolic soccerball (football) [ edit ] This tiling is called a hyperbolic soccerball (football) for its similarity to the truncated icosahedron pattern used on soccer balls. Small portions of it as a hyperbolic surface can be constructed in 3-space.

Related tilings [ edit ] This hyperbolic tiling is topologically related as a part of sequence of uniform truncated polyhedra with vertex configurations (n.6.6), and [n,3] Coxeter group symmetry.
