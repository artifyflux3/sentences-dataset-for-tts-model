[ 1 ] A set E {\displaystyle E} , not necessarily measurable, is said to be a locally measurable set if for every measurable set A {\displaystyle A} of finite measure, E ‚à© ‚à© A {\displaystyle E\cap A} is measurable.

œÉ œÉ {\displaystyle \sigma } -finite measures and measures arising as the restriction of outer measures are saturated.
