[ citation needed ] It was initially called the American Journal of Science and Arts [ 1 ] until a name change [ 1 ] in 1880, [ citation needed ] but its focus was always on natural sciences and especially on geology and related subjects.

[ citation needed ] In early years, the journal was often referred to as "Silliman's Journal", [ 1 ] and the publication became associated with Yale University due to his long tenure there (1804–1853).

[ citation needed ] The editorship long remained in the family of Professor Silliman, as he was assisted by his son, Benjamin Silliman Jr.

, from 1838. On the death of the elder Silliman in 1864, he was succeeded as chief editor by his son-in-law, James Dwight Dana , and then from 1895 till 1926 by Dana's son Edward Salisbury Dana . Associate editors included the botanist Asa Gray and the zoologist Louis Agassiz .

The current editors are Mark T. Brandon, professor at Yale University , C. Page Chamberlain, professor at Stanford University , Francis Macdonald UC Berkeley , and Ann Pearson Harvard University .
