Canup (born November 20, 1968) is an American planetary scientist . Her main area of research concerns the origins of planets and satellites.

[ 1 ] In 2003, Canup was awarded the Harold C. Urey Prize .

[ 2 ] In April, 2022, Canup presented the findings of the Planetary Science Decadal Survey as co-chair of the Survey Steering Committee with Philip R. Christensen .

[ 3 ] Biography [ edit ] She received her B.S. from Duke University and her PhD from the University of Colorado at Boulder .

Canup is known for her research based upon the giant impact hypothesis , using intensive modeling to simulate how planetary collisions unfold.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] In 2012, Canup first published a refinement to the giant impact hypothesis, arguing that the Moon and the Earth formed in a series of steps that started with a massive collision of two planetary bodies, each larger than Mars, which then re-collided to form what we now call Earth.

[ 8 ] After the re-collision, Earth was surrounded by a disk of material, which combined to form the Moon.

[ 9 ] She has written a book on the origin of the Earth and Moon.

[ 10 ] Canup has also published research describing a giant impact origin for Pluto and Charon .

[ 11 ] Canup is an accomplished ballet dancer and danced the lead role in Coppélia in the Boulder Ballet one week after finishing her dissertation.
