George Lichtheim was the son of the scholar and Zionist activist Richard Lichtheim.

[ 1 ] He defined himself as a socialist and stated in a 1964 letter to The New York Review of Books that "I am not a liberal and never have been. I find liberalism almost as boring as communism and have no wish to be drawn into an argument over which of these two antiquated creeds is less likely to advance us any further." [ 2 ] His work appeared in the Palestine Post , Commentary , Partisan Review , Dissent , the New Leader , Encounter , the Times Literary Supplement and The New York Review of Books . He also translated Gershom Scholem 's Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism .

Having moved to London after the Nazis came to power in 1933, he committed suicide in Hampstead in 1973.

[ 3 ] His sister was the Egyptologist Miriam Lichtheim .
