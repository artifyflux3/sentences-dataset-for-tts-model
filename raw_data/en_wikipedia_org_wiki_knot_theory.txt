A knot diagram of the trefoil knot, the simplest non-trivial knot

In [topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology "Topology"), **knot theory** is the study of [mathematical knots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_(mathematics) "Knot (mathematics)"). While inspired by [knots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot "Knot") which appear in daily life, such as those in shoelaces and rope, a mathematical knot differs in that the ends are joined so it cannot be undone, the simplest knot being a ring (or "[unknot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unknot "Unknot")"). In mathematical language, a knot is an [embedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedding "Embedding") of a [circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle "Circle") in 3-dimensional [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space"), ![Image 3: {\displaystyle \mathbb {E} ^{3}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b1f81bfef66c67c01e157738c3bd11dc82a98be0). Two mathematical knots are equivalent if one can be transformed into the other via a deformation of ![Image 4: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f936ddf584f8f3dd2a0ed08917001b7a404c10b5) upon itself (known as an [ambient isotopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_isotopy "Ambient isotopy")); these transformations correspond to manipulations of a knotted string that do not involve cutting it or passing it through itself.

Knots can be described in various ways. Using different description methods, there may be more than one description of the same knot. For example, a common method of describing a knot is a planar diagram called a knot diagram, in which any knot can be drawn in many different ways. Therefore, a fundamental problem in knot theory is determining when two descriptions represent the same knot.

A complete algorithmic solution to this problem exists, which has unknown [complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity "Computational complexity").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory#cite_note-1) In practice, knots are often distinguished using a _[knot invariant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot\_invariant "Knot invariant")_, a "quantity" which is the same when computed from different descriptions of a knot. Important invariants include [knot polynomials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_polynomials "Knot polynomials"), [knot groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_group "Knot group"), and hyperbolic invariants.

The original motivation for the founders of knot theory was to create a table of knots and [links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_(knot_theory) "Link (knot theory)"), which are knots of several components entangled with each other. More than six billion knots and links [have been tabulated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_tabulation "Knot tabulation") since the beginnings of knot theory in the 19th century.

To gain further insight, mathematicians have generalized the knot concept in several ways. Knots can be considered in other [three-dimensional spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-manifold "3-manifold") and objects other than circles can be used; see _[knot (mathematics)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot\_(mathematics) "Knot (mathematics)")_. For example, a higher-dimensional knot is an [_n_-dimensional sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-sphere "N-sphere") embedded in (_n_+2)-dimensional Euclidean space.

Archaeologists have discovered that knot tying dates back to prehistoric times. Besides their uses such as [recording information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khipu "Khipu") and [tying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_tying "Knot tying") objects together, knots have interested humans for their aesthetics and spiritual symbolism. Knots appear in various forms of Chinese artwork dating from several centuries BC (see [Chinese knotting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_knotting "Chinese knotting")). The [endless knot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endless_knot "Endless knot") appears in [Tibetan Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibetan_Buddhism "Tibetan Buddhism"), while the [Borromean rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borromean_rings "Borromean rings") have made repeated appearances in different cultures, often representing strength in unity. The [Celtic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_Christianity "Celtic Christianity") monks who created the [Book of Kells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Kells "Book of Kells") lavished entire pages with intricate [Celtic knotwork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_knot "Celtic knot").

The first knot tabulator, [Peter Guthrie Tait](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Guthrie_Tait "Peter Guthrie Tait")

A mathematical theory of knots was first developed in 1771 by [Alexandre-Théophile Vandermonde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandre-Th%C3%A9ophile_Vandermonde "Alexandre-Théophile Vandermonde") who explicitly noted the importance of topological features when discussing the properties of knots related to the geometry of position. Mathematical studies of knots began in the 19th century with [Carl Friedrich Gauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss "Carl Friedrich Gauss"), who defined the [linking integral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linking_integral "Linking integral") ([Silver 2006](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory#CITEREFSilver2006)). In the 1860s, [Lord Kelvin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Thomson,_1st_Baron_Kelvin "William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin")'s [theory that atoms were knots in the aether](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vortex_theory_of_the_atom "Vortex theory of the atom") led to [Peter Guthrie Tait](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Guthrie_Tait "Peter Guthrie Tait")'s creation of the first knot tables for complete classification. Tait, in 1885, published a table of knots with up to ten crossings, and what came to be known as the [Tait conjectures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tait_conjectures "Tait conjectures"). This record motivated the early knot theorists, but knot theory eventually became part of the emerging subject of [topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology "Topology").

These topologists in the early part of the 20th century—[Max Dehn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Dehn "Max Dehn"), [J. W. Alexander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Waddell_Alexander_II "James Waddell Alexander II"), and others—studied knots from the point of view of the [knot group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_group "Knot group") and invariants from [homology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(mathematics) "Homology (mathematics)") theory such as the [Alexander polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_polynomial "Alexander polynomial"). This would be the main approach to knot theory until a series of breakthroughs transformed the subject.

In the late 1970s, [William Thurston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Thurston "William Thurston") introduced [hyperbolic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry "Hyperbolic geometry") into the study of knots with the [hyperbolization theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometrization_conjecture "Geometrization conjecture"). Many knots were shown to be [hyperbolic knots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_knot "Hyperbolic knot"), enabling the use of geometry in defining new, powerful [knot invariants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_invariant "Knot invariant"). The discovery of the [Jones polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jones_polynomial "Jones polynomial") by [Vaughan Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaughan_Jones "Vaughan Jones") in 1984 ([Sossinsky 2002](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory#CITEREFSossinsky2002), pp.71–89), and subsequent contributions from [Edward Witten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Witten "Edward Witten"), [Maxim Kontsevich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxim_Kontsevich "Maxim Kontsevich"), [Louis Kauffman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Kauffman "Louis Kauffman"), and others, revealed deep connections between knot theory and mathematical methods in [statistical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_mechanics "Statistical mechanics") and [quantum field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory "Quantum field theory"). A plethora of knot invariants have been invented since then, utilizing sophisticated tools such as [quantum groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_group "Quantum group") and [Floer homology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floer_homology "Floer homology").

In the last several decades of the 20th century, scientists became interested in studying [physical knots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_knot_theory "Physical knot theory") in order to understand knotting phenomena in [DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA "DNA") and other polymers. Knot theory can be used to determine if a molecule is [chiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chirality_(chemistry) "Chirality (chemistry)") (has a "handedness") or not ([Simon 1986](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory#CITEREFSimon1986)). [Tangles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangle_(mathematics) "Tangle (mathematics)"), strings with both ends fixed in place, have been effectively used in studying the action of [topoisomerase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topoisomerase "Topoisomerase") on DNA ([Flapan 2000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory#CITEREFFlapan2000)). Knot theory may be crucial in the construction of quantum computers, through the model of [topological quantum computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_quantum_computation "Topological quantum computation") ([Collins 2006](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory#CITEREFCollins2006)).

On the left, the unknot, and a knot equivalent to it. It can be more difficult to determine whether complex knots, such as the one on the right, are equivalent to the unknot.

A knot is created by beginning with a one-[dimensional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension "Dimension") line segment, wrapping it around itself arbitrarily, and then fusing its two free ends together to form a closed loop ([Adams 2004](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory#CITEREFAdams2004)) ([Sossinsky 2002](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory#CITEREFSossinsky2002)). Simply, we can say a knot ![Image 9: {\displaystyle K}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2b76fce82a62ed5461908f0dc8f037de4e3686b0) is a "simple closed curve" (see [Curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve "Curve")) — that is: a "nearly" [injective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injective "Injective") and [continuous function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function "Continuous function")![Image 10: {\displaystyle K\colon [0,1]\to \mathbb {R} ^{3}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3527c328346ff511b17bd2fe2ae5f3504df3d2e9), with the only "non-injectivity" being ![Image 11: {\displaystyle K(0)=K(1)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/52b777ceb922b136715855af6364a3c8e71fc399). Topologists consider knots and other entanglements such as [links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_(knot_theory) "Link (knot theory)") and [braids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braid_theory "Braid theory") to be equivalent if the knot can be pushed about smoothly, without intersecting itself, to coincide with another knot.

The idea of **knot equivalence** is to give a precise definition of when two knots should be considered the same even when positioned quite differently in space. A formal mathematical definition is that two knots ![Image 12: {\displaystyle K_{1},K_{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/20e1ca4f18aed738f059171d774a63a07835d325) are equivalent if there is an [orientation-preserving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientation-preserving "Orientation-preserving")[homeomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeomorphism "Homeomorphism")![Image 13: {\displaystyle h\colon \mathbb {R} ^{3}\to \mathbb {R} ^{3}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b5c0019c7ed674928b50ef302901844595448582) with ![Image 14: {\displaystyle h(K_{1})=K_{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9816f3eae5285f249b1725b04093a81ade864522).

What this definition of knot equivalence means is that two knots are equivalent when there is a continuous family of homeomorphisms ![Image 15: {\displaystyle \{h_{t}:\mathbb {R} ^{3}\rightarrow \mathbb {R} ^{3}\ \mathrm {for} \ 0\leq t\leq 1\}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/178d69636ac401950e3f90e605e93578ec894d22) of space onto itself, such that the last one of them carries the first knot onto the second knot. (In detail: Two knots ![Image 16: {\displaystyle K_{1}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8520077dbcf03c2aabefd98d41a2269ed41a54fa) and ![Image 17: {\displaystyle K_{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/57e1b324cf5b68f2729a8634ff76e396b634b75d) are **equivalent** if there exists a continuous mapping ![Image 18: {\displaystyle H:\mathbb {R} ^{3}\times [0,1]\rightarrow \mathbb {R} ^{3}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1dc228092f3ea7de7bbd32a579a7498ea08e9fb2) such that a) for each ![Image 19: {\displaystyle t\in [0,1]}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/31a5c18739ff04858eecc8fec2f53912c348e0e5) the mapping taking ![Image 20: {\displaystyle x\in \mathbb {R} ^{3}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/04753232bfa03dc57d5dbf46f4f122e62f99a324) to ![Image 21: {\displaystyle H(x,t)\in \mathbb {R} ^{3}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/acbea4adbce617fd4bf5ff7f417f6cc361a9dc35) is a homeomorphism of ![Image 22: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f936ddf584f8f3dd2a0ed08917001b7a404c10b5) onto itself; b) ![Image 23: {\displaystyle H(x,0)=x}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9181aff6335c0d9d177e25026ba437e348e8aac3) for all ![Image 24: {\displaystyle x\in \mathbb {R} ^{3}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/04753232bfa03dc57d5dbf46f4f122e62f99a324); and c) ![Image 25: {\displaystyle H(K_{1},1)=K_{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d81fda6cc35678b8855cd3d6640e3c7d67f1766c). Such a function ![Image 26: {\displaystyle H}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/75a9edddcca2f782014371f75dca39d7e13a9c1b) is known as an [ambient isotopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_isotopy "Ambient isotopy").)

These two notions of knot equivalence agree exactly about which knots are equivalent: Two knots that are equivalent under the orientation-preserving homeomorphism definition are also equivalent under the ambient isotopy definition, because any orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of ![Image 27: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f936ddf584f8f3dd2a0ed08917001b7a404c10b5) to itself is the final stage of an ambient isotopy starting from the identity. Conversely, two knots equivalent under the ambient isotopy definition are also equivalent under the orientation-preserving homeomorphism definition, because the ![Image 28: {\displaystyle t=1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/970dea4a5f5ec5355c4cdd62f6396fbc8b1baaa1) (final) stage of the ambient isotopy must be an orientation-preserving homeomorphism carrying one knot to the other.

The basic problem of knot theory, the **recognition problem**, is determining the equivalence of two knots. [Algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm "Algorithm") exist to solve this problem, with the first given by [Wolfgang Haken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Haken "Wolfgang Haken") in the late 1960s ([Hass 1998](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory#CITEREFHass1998)). Nonetheless, these algorithms can be extremely time-consuming, and a major issue in the theory is to understand how hard this problem really is ([Hass 1998](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory#CITEREFHass1998)). The special case of recognizing the [unknot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unknot "Unknot"), called the [unknotting problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unknotting_problem "Unknotting problem"), is of particular interest ([Hoste 2005](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory#CITEREFHoste2005)). In February 2021 [Marc Lackenby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Lackenby "Marc Lackenby") announced a new unknot recognition algorithm that runs in [quasi-polynomial time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity "Time complexity").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory#cite_note-2)

Tenfold Knottiness, plate IX, from [Peter Guthrie Tait](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Guthrie_Tait "Peter Guthrie Tait")'s article "On Knots", 1884

A useful way to visualise and manipulate knots is to project the knot onto a plane—think of the knot casting a shadow on the wall. A small change in the direction of projection will ensure that it is [one-to-one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injective_function "Injective function") except at the double points, called _crossings_, where the "shadow" of the knot crosses itself once transversely ([Rolfsen 1976](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory#CITEREFRolfsen1976)). At each crossing, to be able to recreate the original knot, the over-strand must be distinguished from the under-strand. This is often done by creating a break in the strand going underneath. The resulting diagram is an [immersed plane curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immersed_plane_curve "Immersed plane curve") with the additional data of which strand is over and which is under at each crossing. (These diagrams are called **knot diagrams** when they represent a [knot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_(mathematics) "Knot (mathematics)") and **link diagrams** when they represent a [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_(knot_theory) "Link (knot theory)").) Analogously, knotted surfaces in 4-space can be related to [immersed surfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immersed_surface "Immersed surface") in 3-space.

A **reduced diagram** is a knot diagram in which there are no **reducible crossings** (also **nugatory** or **removable crossings**), or in which all of the reducible crossings have been removed.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWeisstein2013-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWeisstein2013a-4) A [petal projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petal_projection "Petal projection") is a type of projection in which, instead of forming double points, all strands of the knot meet at a single crossing point, connected to it by loops forming non-nested "petals".[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAdamsCrawfordDeMeoLandry2015-5)

In 1927, working with this diagrammatic form of knots, [J. W. Alexander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Waddell_Alexander_II "James Waddell Alexander II") and [Garland Baird Briggs](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Garland_Baird_Briggs&action=edit&redlink=1 "Garland Baird Briggs (page does not exist)"), and independently [Kurt Reidemeister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Reidemeister "Kurt Reidemeister"), demonstrated that two knot diagrams belonging to the same knot can be related by a sequence of three kinds of moves on the diagram, shown below. These operations, now called the _Reidemeister moves_, are:

1.   Twist and untwist in either direction.
2.   Move one strand completely over another.
3.   Move a strand completely over or under a crossing.

**Reidemeister moves**[![Image 30](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/Reidemeister_move_1.png/250px-Reidemeister_move_1.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Reidemeister_move_1.png)[![Image 31](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/Frame_left.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Frame_left.png)[![Image 32](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Reidemeister_move_2.png/250px-Reidemeister_move_2.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Reidemeister_move_2.png)

Type III

The proof that diagrams of equivalent knots are connected by Reidemeister moves relies on an analysis of what happens under the planar projection of the movement taking one knot to another. The movement can be arranged so that almost all of the time the projection will be a knot diagram, except at finitely many times when an "event" or "catastrophe" occurs, such as when more than two strands cross at a point or multiple strands become tangent at a point. A close inspection will show that complicated events can be eliminated, leaving only the simplest events: (1) a "kink" forming or being straightened out; (2) two strands becoming tangent at a point and passing through; and (3) three strands crossing at a point. These are precisely the Reidemeister moves ([Sossinsky 2002](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory#CITEREFSossinsky2002), ch. 3) ([Lickorish 1997](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory#CITEREFLickorish1997), ch. 1).

A knot invariant is a "quantity" that is the same for equivalent knots ([Adams 2004](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory#CITEREFAdams2004)) ([Lickorish 1997](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory#CITEREFLickorish1997)) ([Rolfsen 1976](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory#CITEREFRolfsen1976)). For example, if the invariant is computed from a knot diagram, it should give the same value for two knot diagrams representing equivalent knots. An invariant may take the same value on two different knots, so by itself may be incapable of distinguishing all knots. An elementary invariant is [tricolorability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tricolorability "Tricolorability").

"Classical" knot invariants include the [knot group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_group "Knot group"), which is the [fundamental group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_group "Fundamental group") of the [knot complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_complement "Knot complement"), and the [Alexander polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_polynomial "Alexander polynomial"), which can be computed from the Alexander invariant, a module constructed from the infinite cyclic cover of the knot complement ([Lickorish 1997](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory#CITEREFLickorish1997))([Rolfsen 1976](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory#CITEREFRolfsen1976)). In the late 20th century, invariants such as "quantum" knot polynomials, [Vassiliev invariants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vassiliev_invariant "Vassiliev invariant") and hyperbolic invariants were discovered. These aforementioned invariants are only the tip of the iceberg of modern knot theory.

A knot polynomial is a [knot invariant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_invariant "Knot invariant") that is a [polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial "Polynomial"). Well-known examples include the [Jones polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jones_polynomial "Jones polynomial"), the [Alexander polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_polynomial "Alexander polynomial"), and the [Kauffman polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kauffman_polynomial "Kauffman polynomial"). A variant of the Alexander polynomial, the [Alexander–Conway polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander%E2%80%93Conway_polynomial "Alexander–Conway polynomial"), is a polynomial in the variable _z_ with [integer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer "Integer") coefficients ([Lickorish 1997](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory#CITEREFLickorish1997)).

The Alexander–Conway polynomial is actually defined in terms of [links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_(knot_theory) "Link (knot theory)"), which consist of one or more knots entangled with each other. The concepts explained above for knots, e.g. diagrams and Reidemeister moves, also hold for links.

Consider an oriented link diagram, _i.e._ one in which every component of the link has a preferred direction indicated by an arrow. For a given crossing of the diagram, let ![Image 35: {\displaystyle L_{+},L_{-},L_{0}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/82c068537cef53c832e1388400f99b3a33892af0) be the oriented link diagrams resulting from changing the diagram as indicated in the figure:

[![Image 36](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/Skein_%28HOMFLY%29.svg/250px-Skein_%28HOMFLY%29.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Skein_(HOMFLY).svg)

The original diagram might be either ![Image 37: {\displaystyle L_{+}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7e0400c11cecda7bb058ba191989776ed7b60d35) or ![Image 38: {\displaystyle L_{-}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/68e31496c2dfd353cf10c89b0d86a82831c71abf), depending on the chosen crossing's configuration. Then the Alexander–Conway polynomial, ![Image 39: {\displaystyle C(z)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2f93d5873532147d908311b46a43b70422d3503b), is recursively defined according to the rules:

The second rule is what is often referred to as a [skein relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skein_relation "Skein relation"). To check that these rules give an invariant of an oriented link, one should determine that the polynomial does not change under the three Reidemeister moves. Many important knot polynomials can be defined in this way.

The following is an example of a typical computation using a skein relation. It computes the Alexander–Conway polynomial of the [trefoil knot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trefoil_knot "Trefoil knot"). The yellow patches indicate where the relation is applied.

_C_([![Image 40](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/db/Skein-relation-trefoil-plus-sm.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Skein-relation-trefoil-plus-sm.png))=_C_([![Image 41](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/Skein-relation-trefoil-minus-sm.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Skein-relation-trefoil-minus-sm.png))+_z_ _C_([![Image 42](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/Skein-relation-trefoil-zero-sm.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Skein-relation-trefoil-zero-sm.png))
gives the unknot and the [Hopf link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopf_link "Hopf link"). Applying the relation to the Hopf link where indicated,

_C_([![Image 43](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/ba/Skein-relation-link22-plus-sm.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Skein-relation-link22-plus-sm.png)) = _C_([![Image 44](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/Skein-relation-link22-minus-sm.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Skein-relation-link22-minus-sm.png)) + _z_ _C_([![Image 45](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/Skein-relation-link22-zero-sm.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Skein-relation-link22-zero-sm.png))
gives a link deformable to one with 0 crossings (it is actually the [unlink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unlink "Unlink") of two components) and an unknot. The unlink takes a bit of sneakiness:

_C_([![Image 46](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1e/Skein-relation-link20-plus-sm.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Skein-relation-link20-plus-sm.png)) = _C_([![Image 47](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/Skein-relation-link20-minus-sm.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Skein-relation-link20-minus-sm.png)) + _z_ _C_([![Image 48](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ab/Skein-relation-link20-zero-sm.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Skein-relation-link20-zero-sm.png))
which implies that _C_(unlink of two components) = 0, since the first two polynomials are of the unknot and thus equal.

Putting all this together will show:

![Image 49: {\displaystyle C(\mathrm {trefoil} )=1+z(0+z)=1+z^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/dbadee567dd1017599001d6546a30a3946794c43)
Since the Alexander–Conway polynomial is a knot invariant, this shows that the trefoil is not equivalent to the unknot. So the trefoil really is "knotted".

*   [![Image 50: The left-handed trefoil knot.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Trefoil_knot_left.svg/120px-Trefoil_knot_left.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Trefoil_knot_left.svg "The left-handed trefoil knot.")

The left-handed trefoil knot.

*   [![Image 51: The right-handed trefoil knot.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/TrefoilKnot_01.svg/120px-TrefoilKnot_01.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:TrefoilKnot_01.svg "The right-handed trefoil knot.")

The right-handed trefoil knot.

Actually, there are two trefoil knots, called the right and left-handed trefoils, which are [mirror images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiral_knot "Chiral knot") of each other (take a diagram of the trefoil given above and change each crossing to the other way to get the mirror image). These are not equivalent to each other, meaning that they are not amphichiral. This was shown by [Max Dehn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Dehn "Max Dehn"), before the invention of knot polynomials, using [group theoretical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_theory "Group theory") methods ([Dehn 1914](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory#CITEREFDehn1914)). But the Alexander–Conway polynomial of each kind of trefoil will be the same, as can be seen by going through the computation above with the mirror image. The _Jones_ polynomial can in fact distinguish between the left- and right-handed trefoil knots ([Lickorish 1997](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory#CITEREFLickorish1997)).

### Hyperbolic invariants

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Knot_theory&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Hyperbolic invariants")]

[William Thurston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Thurston "William Thurston") proved many knots are [hyperbolic knots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_knot "Hyperbolic knot"), meaning that the [knot complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_complement "Knot complement") (i.e., the set of points of 3-space not on the knot) admits a geometric structure, in particular that of [hyperbolic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry "Hyperbolic geometry"). The hyperbolic structure depends only on the knot so any quantity computed from the hyperbolic structure is then a knot invariant ([Adams 2004](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory#CITEREFAdams2004)).

[![Image 52](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/BorromeanRings.svg/250px-BorromeanRings.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:BorromeanRings.svg)

The [Borromean rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borromean_rings "Borromean rings") are a link with the property that removing one ring unlinks the others.

[![Image 53](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/SnapPea-horocusp_view.png/250px-SnapPea-horocusp_view.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:SnapPea-horocusp_view.png)

[SnapPea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SnapPea "SnapPea")'s cusp view: the [Borromean rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borromean_rings "Borromean rings") complement from the perspective of an inhabitant living near the red component.

Geometry lets us visualize what the inside of a knot or link complement looks like by imagining light rays as traveling along the [geodesics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic "Geodesic") of the geometry. An example is provided by the picture of the complement of the [Borromean rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borromean_rings "Borromean rings"). The inhabitant of this link complement is viewing the space from near the red component. The balls in the picture are views of [horoball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horoball "Horoball") neighborhoods of the link. By thickening the link in a standard way, the horoball neighborhoods of the link components are obtained. Even though the boundary of a neighborhood is a torus, when viewed from inside the link complement, it looks like a sphere. Each link component shows up as infinitely many spheres (of one color) as there are infinitely many light rays from the observer to the link component. The fundamental parallelogram (which is indicated in the picture), tiles both vertically and horizontally and shows how to extend the pattern of spheres infinitely.

This pattern, the horoball pattern, is itself a useful invariant. Other hyperbolic invariants include the shape of the fundamental parallelogram, length of shortest geodesic, and volume. Modern knot and link tabulation efforts have utilized these invariants effectively. Fast computers and clever methods of obtaining these invariants make calculating these invariants, in practice, a simple task ([Adams, Hildebrand & Weeks 1991](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory#CITEREFAdamsHildebrandWeeks1991)).

A knot in three dimensions can be untied when placed in four-dimensional space. This is done by changing crossings. Suppose one strand is behind another as seen from a chosen point. Lift it into the fourth dimension, so there is no obstacle (the front strand having no component there); then slide it forward, and drop it back, now in front. Analogies for the plane would be lifting a string up off the surface, or removing a dot from inside a circle.

In fact, in four dimensions, any non-intersecting closed loop of one-dimensional string is equivalent to an unknot. First "push" the loop into a three-dimensional subspace, which is always possible, though technical to explain.

Four-dimensional space occurs in classical knot theory, however, and an important topic is the study of [slice knots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slice_knot "Slice knot") and [ribbon knots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribbon_knot "Ribbon knot").

A notorious open problem, often attributed to [Ralph Fox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Fox "Ralph Fox"),[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory#cite_note-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory#cite_note-KirbyProblemList-7) asks whether every slice knot is also ribbon. A knot is considered smoothly slice if it can be the boundary of a disk that is smoothly embedded in a four-dimensional ball. (The adjective "smoothly" is usually assumed, and smoothly slice knots are referred to as slice. There are other types of knots, such as rationally slice, which are not necessarily smoothly slice.) A ribbon knot is one that bounds a disk D immersed in the 3-sphere. All ribbon knots are known to be slice knots.

### Knotting spheres of higher dimension

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Knot_theory&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Knotting spheres of higher dimension")]

Since a knot can be considered topologically a 1-dimensional sphere, the next generalization is to consider a [two-dimensional sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2-sphere "2-sphere") (![Image 54: {\displaystyle \mathbb {S} ^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/518268b00344a37811c08a236412bffaa68f75d4)) embedded in 4-dimensional Euclidean space (![Image 55: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{4}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e4abb9b9dab94f7b25a4210364f0f9032704bfb9)). Such an embedding is knotted if there is no homeomorphism of ![Image 56: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{4}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e4abb9b9dab94f7b25a4210364f0f9032704bfb9) onto itself taking the embedded 2-sphere to the standard "round" embedding of the 2-sphere. [Suspended knots](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Suspended_knot&action=edit&redlink=1 "Suspended knot (page does not exist)") and [spun knots](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Spun_knot&action=edit&redlink=1 "Spun knot (page does not exist)") are two typical families of such 2-sphere knots.

The mathematical technique called "general position" implies that for a given _n_-sphere in _m_-dimensional Euclidean space, if _m_ is large enough (depending on _n_), the sphere should be unknotted. In general, [piecewise-linear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piecewise_linear_manifold "Piecewise linear manifold")[_n_-spheres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-sphere "N-sphere") form knots only in (_n_+2)-dimensional space ([Zeeman 1963](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory#CITEREFZeeman1963)), although this is no longer a requirement for smoothly knotted spheres. In fact, there are smoothly knotted ![Image 57: {\displaystyle (4k-1)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c7eae7a52f5a332ce92a85d0aea500b95512dfe3)-spheres in 6 _k_-dimensional space; e.g., there is a smoothly knotted 3-sphere in ![Image 58: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{6}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/547484e275658bac48b1ad8f5407446612d4a65c) ([Haefliger 1962](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory#CITEREFHaefliger1962)) ([Levine 1965](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory#CITEREFLevine1965)). Thus the codimension of a smooth knot can be arbitrarily large when not fixing the dimension of the knotted sphere; however, any smooth _k_-sphere embedded in ![Image 59: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c510b63578322050121fe966f2e5770bea43308d) with ![Image 60: {\displaystyle 2n-3k-3>0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/52f4bd67175fe6d6b322b56055f7a3c19a0ea599) is unknotted. The notion of a knot has further generalisations in mathematics, see: [Knot (mathematics)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_(mathematics) "Knot (mathematics)"), [isotopy classification of embeddings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitney_embedding_theorem#Isotopy_versions "Whitney embedding theorem").

Every knot in the [_n_-sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-sphere "N-sphere")![Image 61: {\displaystyle \mathbb {S} ^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/41c00c9d3635f5230e6ac11902a50f2323794ed6) is the link of a [real-algebraic set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_algebraic_set "Real algebraic set") with isolated singularity in ![Image 62: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n+1}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ccea3976e1f8a1bb853c8ca00e52d518a3a4fe07) ([Akbulut & King 1981](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory#CITEREFAkbulutKing1981)).

An _n_-knot is a single ![Image 63: {\displaystyle \mathbb {S} ^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/41c00c9d3635f5230e6ac11902a50f2323794ed6) embedded in ![Image 64: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{m}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6a87a024931038d1858dc22e8a194e5978c3412e). An _n_-link consists of _k_-copies of ![Image 65: {\displaystyle \mathbb {S} ^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/41c00c9d3635f5230e6ac11902a50f2323794ed6) embedded in ![Image 66: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{m}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6a87a024931038d1858dc22e8a194e5978c3412e), where _k_ is a [natural number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number "Natural number"). Both the ![Image 67: {\displaystyle m=n+2}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0bd7a87626645eebe52faa6a0b2b019ec7279465) and the ![Image 68: {\displaystyle m>n+2}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6a777e81e5204aeb3379fdfa516e7dff5bdf02b8) cases are well studied, and so is the ![Image 69: {\displaystyle n>1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ee74e1cc07e7041edf0fcbd4481f5cd32ad17b64) case.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory#cite_note-8)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory#cite_note-9)

[![Image 70](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/Sum_of_knots3.svg/250px-Sum_of_knots3.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sum_of_knots3.svg)

Adding two knots

Two knots can be added by cutting both knots and joining the pairs of ends. The operation is called the _knot sum_, or sometimes the _connected sum_ or _composition_ of two knots. This can be formally defined as follows ([Adams 2004](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory#CITEREFAdams2004)): consider a planar projection of each knot and suppose these projections are disjoint. Find a rectangle in the plane where one pair of opposite sides are arcs along each knot while the rest of the rectangle is disjoint from the knots. Form a new knot by deleting the first pair of opposite sides and adjoining the other pair of opposite sides. The resulting knot is a sum of the original knots. Depending on how this is done, two different knots (but no more) may result. This ambiguity in the sum can be eliminated regarding the knots as _oriented_, i.e. having a preferred direction of travel along the knot, and requiring the arcs of the knots in the sum are oriented consistently with the oriented boundary of the rectangle.

The knot sum of oriented knots is [commutative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative "Commutative") and [associative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative "Associative"). A [knot is _prime_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_knot "Prime knot") if it is non-trivial and cannot be written as the knot sum of two non-trivial knots. A knot that can be written as such a sum is _composite_. There is a prime decomposition for knots, analogous to [prime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number "Prime number") and composite numbers ([Schubert 1949](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory#CITEREFSchubert1949)). For oriented knots, this decomposition is also unique. Higher-dimensional knots can also be added but there are some differences. While you cannot form the unknot in three dimensions by adding two non-trivial knots, you can in higher dimensions, at least when one considers _smooth_ knots in codimension at least 3.

Knots can also be constructed using the [circuit topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_topology "Circuit topology") approach. This is done by combining basic units called soft contacts using five operations (Parallel, Series, Cross, Concerted, and Sub).[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory#cite_note-10)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory#cite_note-11) The approach is applicable to open chains as well and can also be extended to include the so-called hard contacts.

[![Image 71](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/Knot_table.svg/380px-Knot_table.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Knot_table.svg)

A table of prime knots up to seven crossings. The knots are labeled with Alexander–Briggs notation

Traditionally, knots have been catalogued in terms of [crossing number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossing_number_(knot_theory) "Crossing number (knot theory)"). Knot tables generally include only prime knots, and only one entry for a knot and its mirror image (even if they are different) ([Hoste, Thistlethwaite & Weeks 1998](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory#CITEREFHosteThistlethwaiteWeeks1998)). The number of nontrivial knots of a given crossing number increases rapidly, making tabulation computationally difficult ([Hoste 2005](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory#CITEREFHoste2005), p.20). Tabulation efforts have succeeded in enumerating over 6 billion knots and links ([Hoste 2005](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory#CITEREFHoste2005), p.28). The sequence of the number of prime knots of a given crossing number, up to crossing number 16, is 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 7, 21, 49, 165, 552, 2176, 9988, 46 972, 253 293, 1 388 705... (sequence [A002863](https://oeis.org/A002863 "oeis:A002863") in the [OEIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-Line_Encyclopedia_of_Integer_Sequences "On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences")). While exponential upper and lower bounds for this sequence are known, it has not been proven that this sequence is strictly increasing ([Adams 2004](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory#CITEREFAdams2004)).

The first knot tables by Tait, Little, and Kirkman used knot diagrams, although Tait also used a precursor to the [Dowker notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dowker_notation "Dowker notation"). Different notations have been invented for knots which allow more efficient tabulation ([Hoste 2005](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory#CITEREFHoste2005)).

The early tables attempted to list all knots of at most 10 crossings, and all alternating knots of 11 crossings ([Hoste, Thistlethwaite & Weeks 1998](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory#CITEREFHosteThistlethwaiteWeeks1998)). The development of knot theory due to Alexander, Reidemeister, Seifert, and others eased the task of verification and tables of knots up to and including 9 crossings were published by Alexander–Briggs and Reidemeister in the late 1920s.

The first major verification of this work was done in the 1960s by [John Horton Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway "John Horton Conway"), who not only developed a new notation but also the [Alexander–Conway polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander%E2%80%93Conway_polynomial "Alexander–Conway polynomial") ([Conway 1970](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory#CITEREFConway1970)) ([Doll & Hoste 1991](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory#CITEREFDollHoste1991)). This verified the list of knots of at most 11 crossings and a new list of links up to 10 crossings. Conway found a number of omissions but only one duplication in the Tait–Little tables; however he missed the duplicates called the [Perko pair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perko_pair "Perko pair"), which would only be noticed in 1974 by [Kenneth Perko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Perko "Kenneth Perko") ([Perko 1974](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory#CITEREFPerko1974)). This famous error would propagate when Dale Rolfsen added a knot table in his influential text, based on Conway's work. Conway's 1970 paper on knot theory also contains a typographical duplication on its non-alternating 11-crossing knots page and omits 4 examples — 2 previously listed in D. Lombardero's 1968 Princeton senior thesis and 2 more subsequently discovered by [Alain Caudron](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alain_Caudron&action=edit&redlink=1 "Alain Caudron (page does not exist)"). [see Perko (1982), Primality of certain knots, Topology Proceedings] Less famous is the duplicate in his 10 crossing link table: 2.-2.-20.20 is the mirror of 8*-20:-20. [See Perko (2016), Historical highlights of non-cyclic knot theory, J. Knot Theory Ramifications].

In the late 1990s Hoste, Thistlethwaite, and Weeks tabulated all the knots through 16 crossings ([Hoste, Thistlethwaite & Weeks 1998](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory#CITEREFHosteThistlethwaiteWeeks1998)). In 2003 Rankin, Flint, and Schermann, tabulated the [alternating knots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternating_knot "Alternating knot") through 22 crossings ([Hoste 2005](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory#CITEREFHoste2005)). In 2020 Burton tabulated all [prime knots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_knot "Prime knot") with up to 19 crossings ([Burton 2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory#CITEREFBurton2020)).

### Alexander–Briggs notation

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Knot_theory&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Alexander–Briggs notation")]

This is the most traditional notation, due to the 1927 paper of [James W. Alexander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Waddell_Alexander_II "James Waddell Alexander II") and [Garland B. Briggs](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Garland_Baird_Briggs&action=edit&redlink=1 "Garland Baird Briggs (page does not exist)") and later extended by [Dale Rolfsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dale_Rolfsen "Dale Rolfsen") in his knot table (see image above and [List of prime knots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_prime_knots "List of prime knots")). The notation simply organizes knots by their crossing number. One writes the crossing number with a subscript to denote its order amongst all knots with that crossing number. This order is arbitrary and so has no special significance (though in each number of crossings the [twist knot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twist_knot "Twist knot") comes after the [torus knot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torus_knot "Torus knot")). Links are written by the crossing number with a superscript to denote the number of components and a subscript to denote its order within the links with the same number of components and crossings. Thus the trefoil knot is notated 3 1 and the Hopf link is 2 2

1. Alexander–Briggs names in the range 10 162 to 10 166 are ambiguous, due to the discovery of the [Perko pair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perko_pair "Perko pair") in [Charles Newton Little](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Newton_Little "Charles Newton Little")'s original and subsequent knot tables, and differences in approach to correcting this error in knot tables and other publications created after this point.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory#cite_note-12)

### Dowker–Thistlethwaite notation

A knot diagram with crossings labelled for a Dowker sequence

The [Dowker–Thistlethwaite notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dowker%E2%80%93Thistlethwaite_notation "Dowker–Thistlethwaite notation"), also called the Dowker notation or code, for a knot is a finite sequence of even integers. The numbers are generated by following the knot and marking the crossings with consecutive integers. Since each crossing is visited twice, this creates a pairing of even integers with odd integers. An appropriate sign is given to indicate over and undercrossing. For example, in this figure the knot diagram has crossings labelled with the pairs (1,6) (3,−12) (5,2) (7,8) (9,−4) and (11,−10). The Dowker–Thistlethwaite notation for this labelling is the sequence: 6, −12, 2, 8, −4, −10. A knot diagram has more than one possible Dowker notation, and there is a well-understood ambiguity when reconstructing a knot from a Dowker–Thistlethwaite notation.

The [Conway notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway_notation_(knot_theory) "Conway notation (knot theory)") for knots and links, named after [John Horton Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway "John Horton Conway"), is based on the theory of [tangles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangle_(mathematics) "Tangle (mathematics)") ([Conway 1970](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory#CITEREFConway1970)). The advantage of this notation is that it reflects some properties of the knot or link.

The notation describes how to construct a particular link diagram of the link. Start with a _basic polyhedron_, a 4-valent connected planar graph with no [digon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digon "Digon") regions. Such a polyhedron is denoted first by the number of vertices then a number of asterisks which determine the polyhedron's position on a list of basic polyhedra. For example, 10** denotes the second 10-vertex polyhedron on Conway's list.

Each vertex then has an [algebraic tangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_tangle "Algebraic tangle") substituted into it (each vertex is oriented so there is no arbitrary choice in substitution). Each such tangle has a notation consisting of numbers and + or − signs.

An example is 1*2 −3 2. The 1* denotes the only 1-vertex basic polyhedron. The 2 −3 2 is a sequence describing the continued fraction associated to a [rational tangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_tangle "Rational tangle"). One inserts this tangle at the vertex of the basic polyhedron 1*.

A more complicated example is 8*3.1.2 0.1.1.1.1.1 Here again 8* refers to a basic polyhedron with 8 vertices. The periods separate the notation for each tangle.

Any link admits such a description, and it is clear this is a very compact notation even for very large crossing number. There are some further shorthands usually used. The last example is usually written 8*3:2 0, where the ones are omitted and kept the number of dots excepting the dots at the end. For an algebraic knot such as in the first example, 1* is often omitted.

Conway's pioneering paper on the subject lists up to 10-vertex basic polyhedra of which he uses to tabulate links, which have become standard for those links. For a further listing of higher vertex polyhedra, there are nonstandard choices available.

[Gauss code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss_code "Gauss code"), similar to the Dowker–Thistlethwaite notation, represents a knot with a sequence of integers. However, rather than every crossing being represented by two different numbers, crossings are labeled with only one number. When the crossing is an overcrossing, a positive number is listed. At an undercrossing, a negative number. For example, the trefoil knot in Gauss code can be given as: 1,−2,3,−1,2,−3

Gauss code is limited in its ability to identify knots. This problem is partially addressed with by the [extended Gauss code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Gauss_code "Extended Gauss code").

### Introductory textbooks

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Knot_theory&action=edit&section=21 "Edit section: Introductory textbooks")]

There are a number of introductions to knot theory. A classical introduction for graduate students or advanced undergraduates is ([Rolfsen 1976](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory#CITEREFRolfsen1976)). Other good texts from the references are ([Adams 2004](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory#CITEREFAdams2004)) and ([Lickorish 1997](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory#CITEREFLickorish1997)). Adams is informal and accessible for the most part to high schoolers. Lickorish is a rigorous introduction for graduate students, covering a nice mix of classical and modern topics. ([Cromwell 2004](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory#CITEREFCromwell2004)) is suitable for undergraduates who know point-set topology; knowledge of algebraic topology is not required.
