[ 2 ] [ 3 ] It is a specific example of a quotient , as viewed from the general setting of universal algebra . Starting with a ring R {\displaystyle R} and a two-sided ideal I {\displaystyle I} in ⁠ R {\displaystyle R} ⁠ , a new ring, the quotient ring ⁠ R / I {\displaystyle R\ /\ I} ⁠ , is constructed, whose elements are the cosets of I {\displaystyle I} in R {\displaystyle R} subject to special + {\displaystyle +} and ⋅ ⋅ {\displaystyle \cdot } operations. (Quotient ring notation almost always uses a fraction slash " ⁠ / {\displaystyle /} ⁠ "; stacking the ring over the ideal using a horizontal line as a separator is uncommon and generally avoided.) Quotient rings are distinct from the so-called "quotient field", or field of fractions , of an integral domain as well as from the more general "rings of quotients" obtained by localization .

Formal quotient ring construction [ edit ] Given a ring R {\displaystyle R} and a two-sided ideal I {\displaystyle I} in ⁠ R {\displaystyle R} ⁠ , we may define an equivalence relation ∼ ∼ {\displaystyle \sim } on R {\displaystyle R} as follows: a ∼ ∼ b {\displaystyle a\sim b} if and only if a − − b {\displaystyle a-b} is in ⁠ I {\displaystyle I} ⁠ .

Using the ideal properties, it is not difficult to check that ∼ ∼ {\displaystyle \sim } is a congruence relation .
In case ⁠ a ∼ ∼ b {\displaystyle a\sim b} ⁠ , we say that a {\displaystyle a} and b {\displaystyle b} are congruent modulo I {\displaystyle I} (for example, 1 {\displaystyle 1} and 3 {\displaystyle 3} are congruent modulo 2 {\displaystyle 2} as their difference is an element of the ideal ⁠ 2 Z {\displaystyle 2\mathbb {Z} } ⁠ , the even integers ). The equivalence class of the element a {\displaystyle a} in R {\displaystyle R} is given by: [ a ] = a ¯ ¯ = a + I := { a + r : r ∈ ∈ I } {\displaystyle \left[a\right]={\overline {a}}=a+I:=\left\lbrace a+r:r\in I\right\rbrace } This equivalence class is also sometimes written as a mod I {\displaystyle a{\bmod {I}}} and called the "residue class of a {\displaystyle a} modulo I {\displaystyle I} ".

The set of all such equivalence classes is denoted by ⁠ R / I {\displaystyle R\ /\ I} ⁠ ; it becomes a ring, the factor ring or quotient ring of R {\displaystyle R} modulo ⁠ I {\displaystyle I} ⁠ , if one defines ⁠ ( a + I ) + ( b + I ) = ( a + b ) + I {\displaystyle (a+I)+(b+I)=(a+b)+I} ⁠ ; ⁠ ( a + I ) ( b + I ) = ( a b ) + I {\displaystyle (a+I)(b+I)=(ab)+I} ⁠ .

(Here one has to check that these definitions are well-defined . Compare coset and quotient group .) The zero-element of R / I {\displaystyle R\ /\ I} is ⁠ 0 ¯ ¯ = 0 + I = I {\displaystyle {\bar {0}}=0+I=I} ⁠ , and the multiplicative identity is ⁠ 1 ¯ ¯ = 1 + I {\displaystyle {\bar {1}}=1+I} ⁠ .

The map p {\displaystyle p} from R {\displaystyle R} to R / I {\displaystyle R\ /\ I} defined by p ( a ) = a + I {\displaystyle p(a)=a+I} is a surjective ring homomorphism , sometimes called the natural quotient map , natural projection map , or the canonical homomorphism .

Examples [ edit ] The quotient ring R / { 0 } {\displaystyle R\ /\ \lbrace 0\rbrace } is naturally isomorphic to ⁠ R {\displaystyle R} ⁠ , and R / R {\displaystyle R/R} is the zero ring ⁠ { 0 } {\displaystyle \lbrace 0\rbrace } ⁠ , since, by our definition, for any ⁠ r ∈ ∈ R {\displaystyle r\in R} ⁠ , we have that ⁠ [ r ] = r + R = { r + b : b ∈ ∈ R } {\displaystyle \left[r\right]=r+R=\left\lbrace r+b:b\in R\right\rbrace } ⁠ , which equals R {\displaystyle R} itself. This fits with the rule of thumb that the larger the ideal ⁠ I {\displaystyle I} ⁠ , the smaller the quotient ring ⁠ R / I {\displaystyle R\ /\ I} ⁠ . If I {\displaystyle I} is a proper ideal of ⁠ R {\displaystyle R} ⁠ , i.e., ⁠ I ≠ ≠ R {\displaystyle I\neq R} ⁠ , then R / I {\displaystyle R/I} is not the zero ring.

Consider the ring of integers Z {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} } and the ideal of even numbers , denoted by ⁠ 2 Z {\displaystyle 2\mathbb {Z} } ⁠ . Then the quotient ring Z / 2 Z {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} /2\mathbb {Z} } has only two elements, the coset 0 + 2 Z {\displaystyle 0+2\mathbb {Z} } consisting of the even numbers and the coset 1 + 2 Z {\displaystyle 1+2\mathbb {Z} } consisting of the odd numbers; applying the definition, ⁠ [ z ] = z + 2 Z = { z + 2 y : 2 y ∈ ∈ 2 Z } {\displaystyle \left[z\right]=z+2\mathbb {Z} =\left\lbrace z+2y:2y\in 2\mathbb {Z} \right\rbrace } ⁠ , where 2 Z {\displaystyle 2\mathbb {Z} } is the ideal of even numbers. It is naturally isomorphic to the finite field with two elements, ⁠ F 2 {\displaystyle F_{2}} ⁠ . Intuitively: if you think of all the even numbers as ⁠ 0 {\displaystyle 0} ⁠ , then every integer is either 0 {\displaystyle 0} (if it is even) or 1 {\displaystyle 1} (if it is odd and therefore differs from an even number by ⁠ 1 {\displaystyle 1} ⁠ ).

Modular arithmetic is essentially arithmetic in the quotient ring Z / n Z {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} /n\mathbb {Z} } (which has n {\displaystyle n} elements).

Now consider the ring of polynomials in the variable X {\displaystyle X} with real coefficients , ⁠ R [ X ] {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} [X]} ⁠ , and the ideal I = ( X 2 + 1 ) {\displaystyle I=\left(X^{2}+1\right)} consisting of all multiples of the polynomial ⁠ X 2 + 1 {\displaystyle X^{2}+1} ⁠ . The quotient ring R [ X ] / ( X 2 + 1 ) {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} [X]\ /\ (X^{2}+1)} is naturally isomorphic to the field of complex numbers ⁠ C {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} } ⁠ , with the class [ X ] {\displaystyle [X]} playing the role of the imaginary unit ⁠ i {\displaystyle i} ⁠ . The reason is that we "forced" ⁠ X 2 + 1 = 0 {\displaystyle X^{2}+1=0} ⁠ , i.e.

⁠ X 2 = − − 1 {\displaystyle X^{2}=-1} ⁠ , which is the defining property of ⁠ i {\displaystyle i} ⁠ . Since any integer exponent of i {\displaystyle i} must be either ± ± i {\displaystyle \pm i} or ⁠ ± ± 1 {\displaystyle \pm 1} ⁠ , that means all possible polynomials essentially simplify to the form ⁠ a + b i {\displaystyle a+bi} ⁠ . (To clarify, the quotient ring ⁠ R [ X ] / ( X 2 + 1 ) {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} [X]\ /\ (X^{2}+1)} ⁠ is actually naturally isomorphic to the field of all linear polynomials ⁠ a X + b ; a , b ∈ ∈ R {\displaystyle aX+b;a,b\in \mathbb {R} } ⁠ , where the operations are performed modulo ⁠ X 2 + 1 {\displaystyle X^{2}+1} ⁠ . In return, we have ⁠ X 2 = − − 1 {\displaystyle X^{2}=-1} ⁠ , and this is matching X {\displaystyle X} to the imaginary unit in the isomorphic field of complex numbers.) Generalizing the previous example, quotient rings are often used to construct field extensions . Suppose K {\displaystyle K} is some field and f {\displaystyle f} is an irreducible polynomial in ⁠ K [ X ] {\displaystyle K[X]} ⁠ . Then L = K [ X ] / ( f ) {\displaystyle L=K[X]\ /\ (f)} is a field whose minimal polynomial over K {\displaystyle K} is ⁠ f {\displaystyle f} ⁠ , which contains K {\displaystyle K} as well as an element ⁠ x = X + ( f ) {\displaystyle x=X+(f)} ⁠ .

One important instance of the previous example is the construction of the finite fields. Consider for instance the field F 3 = Z / 3 Z {\displaystyle F_{3}=\mathbb {Z} /3\mathbb {Z} } with three elements. The polynomial f ( X ) = X 2 + 1 {\displaystyle f(X)=X^{2}+1} is irreducible over F 3 {\displaystyle F_{3}} (since it has no root), and we can construct the quotient ring ⁠ F 3 [ X ] / ( f ) {\displaystyle F_{3}[X]\ /\ (f)} ⁠ . This is a field with 3 2 = 9 {\displaystyle 3^{2}=9} elements, denoted by ⁠ F 9 {\displaystyle F_{9}} ⁠ . The other finite fields can be constructed in a similar fashion.

The coordinate rings of algebraic varieties are important examples of quotient rings in algebraic geometry . As a simple case, consider the real variety V = { ( x , y ) | x 2 = y 3 } {\displaystyle V=\left\lbrace (x,y)|x^{2}=y^{3}\right\rbrace } as a subset of the real plane ⁠ R 2 {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{2}} ⁠ . The ring of real-valued polynomial functions defined on V {\displaystyle V} can be identified with the quotient ring ⁠ R [ X , Y ] / ( X 2 − − Y 3 ) {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} [X,Y]\ /\ (X^{2}-Y^{3})} ⁠ , and this is the coordinate ring of ⁠ V {\displaystyle V} ⁠ . The variety V {\displaystyle V} is now investigated by studying its coordinate ring.

Suppose M {\displaystyle M} is a C ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} ^{\infty }} - manifold , and p {\displaystyle p} is a point of ⁠ M {\displaystyle M} ⁠ . Consider the ring R = C ∞ ∞ ( M ) {\displaystyle R=\mathbb {C} ^{\infty }(M)} of all C ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} ^{\infty }} -functions defined on M {\displaystyle M} and let I {\displaystyle I} be the ideal in R {\displaystyle R} consisting of those functions f {\displaystyle f} which are identically zero in some neighborhood U {\displaystyle U} of p {\displaystyle p} (where U {\displaystyle U} may depend on ⁠ f {\displaystyle f} ⁠ ). Then the quotient ring R / I {\displaystyle R\ /\ I} is the ring of germs of C ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} ^{\infty }} -functions on M {\displaystyle M} at ⁠ p {\displaystyle p} ⁠ .

Consider the ring F {\displaystyle F} of finite elements of a hyperreal field ⁠ ∗ ∗ R {\displaystyle ^{*}\mathbb {R} } ⁠ . It consists of all hyperreal numbers differing from a standard real by an infinitesimal amount, or equivalently: of all hyperreal numbers x {\displaystyle x} for which a standard integer n {\displaystyle n} with − − n < x < n {\displaystyle -n<x<n} exists. The set I {\displaystyle I} of all infinitesimal numbers in ⁠ ∗ ∗ R {\displaystyle ^{*}\mathbb {R} } ⁠ , together with ⁠ 0 {\displaystyle 0} ⁠ , is an ideal in ⁠ F {\displaystyle F} ⁠ , and the quotient ring F / I {\displaystyle F\ /\ I} is isomorphic to the real numbers ⁠ R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } ⁠ . The isomorphism is induced by associating to every element x {\displaystyle x} of F {\displaystyle F} the standard part of ⁠ x {\displaystyle x} ⁠ , i.e. the unique real number that differs from x {\displaystyle x} by an infinitesimal.  In fact, one obtains the same result, namely ⁠ R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } ⁠ , if one starts with the ring F {\displaystyle F} of finite hyperrationals (i.e. ratio of a pair of hyperintegers ), see construction of the real numbers .

Variations of complex planes [ edit ] The quotients ⁠ R [ X ] / ( X ) {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} [X]/(X)} ⁠ , ⁠ R [ X ] / ( X + 1 ) {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} [X]/(X+1)} ⁠ , and R [ X ] / ( X − − 1 ) {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} [X]/(X-1)} are all isomorphic to R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } and gain little interest at first. But note that R [ X ] / ( X 2 ) {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} [X]/(X^{2})} is called the dual number plane in geometric algebra. It consists only of linear binomials as "remainders" after reducing an element of R [ X ] {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} [X]} by ⁠ X 2 {\displaystyle X^{2}} ⁠ .  This variation of a complex plane arises as a subalgebra whenever the algebra contains a real line and a nilpotent .

Furthermore, the ring quotient R [ X ] / ( X 2 − − 1 ) {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} [X]/(X^{2}-1)} does split into R [ X ] / ( X + 1 ) {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} [X]/(X+1)} and ⁠ R [ X ] / ( X − − 1 ) {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} [X]/(X-1)} ⁠ , so this ring is often viewed as the direct sum ⁠ R ⊕ ⊕ R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} \oplus \mathbb {R} } ⁠ .
Nevertheless, a variation on complex numbers z = x + y j {\displaystyle z=x+yj} is suggested by j {\displaystyle j} as a root of ⁠ X 2 − − 1 = 0 {\displaystyle X^{2}-1=0} ⁠ , compared to i {\displaystyle i} as root of ⁠ X 2 + 1 = 0 {\displaystyle X^{2}+1=0} ⁠ . This plane of split-complex numbers normalizes the direct sum R ⊕ ⊕ R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} \oplus \mathbb {R} } by providing a basis { 1 , j } {\displaystyle \left\lbrace 1,j\right\rbrace } for 2-space where the identity of the algebra is at unit distance from the zero. With this basis a unit hyperbola may be compared to the unit circle of the ordinary complex plane .

Quaternions and variations [ edit ] Suppose X {\displaystyle X} and Y {\displaystyle Y} are two non-commuting indeterminates and form the free algebra ⁠ R ⟨ ⟨ X , Y ⟩ ⟩ {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} \langle X,Y\rangle } ⁠ .  Then Hamilton's quaternions of 1843 can be cast as: R ⟨ ⟨ X , Y ⟩ ⟩ / ( X 2 + 1 , Y 2 + 1 , X Y + Y X ) {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} \langle X,Y\rangle /(X^{2}+1,\,Y^{2}+1,\,XY+YX)} If Y 2 − − 1 {\displaystyle Y^{2}-1} is substituted for ⁠ Y 2 + 1 {\displaystyle Y^{2}+1} ⁠ , then one obtains the ring of split-quaternions . The anti-commutative property Y X = − − X Y {\displaystyle YX=-XY} implies that X Y {\displaystyle XY} has as its square: ( X Y ) ( X Y ) = X ( Y X ) Y = − − X ( X Y ) Y = − − ( X X ) ( Y Y ) = − − ( − − 1 ) ( + 1 ) = + 1 {\displaystyle (XY)(XY)=X(YX)Y=-X(XY)Y=-(XX)(YY)=-(-1)(+1)=+1} Substituting minus for plus in both the quadratic binomials also results in split-quaternions.

The three types of biquaternions can also be written as quotients by use of the free algebra with three indeterminates R ⟨ ⟨ X , Y , Z ⟩ ⟩ {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} \langle X,Y,Z\rangle } and constructing appropriate ideals.

Properties [ edit ] Clearly, if R {\displaystyle R} is a commutative ring , then so is ⁠ R / I {\displaystyle R\ /\ I} ⁠ ; the converse, however, is not true in general.

The natural quotient map p {\displaystyle p} has I {\displaystyle I} as its kernel ; since the kernel of every ring homomorphism is a two-sided ideal, we can state that two-sided ideals are precisely the kernels of ring homomorphisms.

The intimate relationship between ring homomorphisms, kernels and quotient rings can be summarized as follows: the ring homomorphisms defined on R / I {\displaystyle R\ /\ I} are essentially the same as the ring homomorphisms defined on R {\displaystyle R} that vanish (i.e. are zero) on ⁠ I {\displaystyle I} ⁠ . More precisely, given a two-sided ideal I {\displaystyle I} in R {\displaystyle R} and a ring homomorphism f : R → → S {\displaystyle f:R\to S} whose kernel contains ⁠ I {\displaystyle I} ⁠ , there exists precisely one ring homomorphism g : R / I → → S {\displaystyle g:R\ /\ I\to S} with g p = f {\displaystyle gp=f} (where p {\displaystyle p} is the natural quotient map). The map g {\displaystyle g} here is given by the well-defined rule g ( [ a ] ) = f ( a ) {\displaystyle g([a])=f(a)} for all a {\displaystyle a} in ⁠ 1 R {\displaystyle 1R} ⁠ . Indeed, this universal property can be used to define quotient rings and their natural quotient maps.

As a consequence of the above, one obtains the fundamental statement: every ring homomorphism f : R → → S {\displaystyle f:R\to S} induces a ring isomorphism between the quotient ring R / ker ⁡ ⁡ ( f ) {\displaystyle R\ /\ \ker(f)} and the image ⁠ i m ( f ) {\displaystyle \mathrm {im} (f)} ⁠ . (See also: Fundamental theorem on homomorphisms .) The ideals of R {\displaystyle R} and R / I {\displaystyle R\ /\ I} are closely related: the natural quotient map provides a bijection between the two-sided ideals of R {\displaystyle R} that contain I {\displaystyle I} and the two-sided ideals of R / I {\displaystyle R\ /\ I} (the same is true for left and for right ideals). This relationship between two-sided ideal extends to a relationship between the corresponding quotient rings: if M {\displaystyle M} is a two-sided ideal in R {\displaystyle R} that contains ⁠ I {\displaystyle I} ⁠ , and we write M / I {\displaystyle M\ /\ I} for the corresponding ideal in R / I {\displaystyle R\ /\ I} (i.e.

⁠ M / I = p ( M ) {\displaystyle M\ /\ I=p(M)} ⁠ ), the quotient rings R / M {\displaystyle R\ /\ M} and ( R / I ) / ( M / I ) {\displaystyle (R/I)\ /\ (M/I)} are naturally isomorphic via the (well-defined) mapping ⁠ a + M ↦ ↦ ( a + I ) + M / I {\displaystyle a+M\mapsto (a+I)+M/I} ⁠ .

The following facts prove useful in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry : for R ≠ ≠ { 0 } {\displaystyle R\neq \lbrace 0\rbrace } commutative, R / I {\displaystyle R\ /\ I} is a field if and only if I {\displaystyle I} is a maximal ideal , while R / I {\displaystyle R/I} is an integral domain if and only if I {\displaystyle I} is a prime ideal . A number of similar statements relate properties of the ideal I {\displaystyle I} to properties of the quotient ring ⁠ R / I {\displaystyle R\ /\ I} ⁠ .

The Chinese remainder theorem states that, if the ideal I {\displaystyle I} is the intersection (or equivalently, the product) of pairwise coprime ideals ⁠ I 1 , … … , I k {\displaystyle I_{1},\ldots ,I_{k}} ⁠ , then the quotient ring R / I {\displaystyle R\ /\ I} is isomorphic to the product of the quotient rings ⁠ R / I n , n = 1 , … … , k {\displaystyle R\ /\ I_{n},\;n=1,\ldots ,k} ⁠ .

For algebras over a ring [ edit ] An associative algebra A {\displaystyle A} over a commutative ring R {\displaystyle R} is a ring itself. If I {\displaystyle I} is an ideal in A {\displaystyle A} (closed under R {\displaystyle R} -multiplication), then A / I {\displaystyle A/I} inherits the structure of an algebra over R {\displaystyle R} and is the quotient algebra .
