( June 2018 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) E. Tory Higgins Born Edward Tory Higgins ( 1946-03-12 ) March 12, 1946 (age 79) Alma mater McGill University Columbia University Scientific career Fields Social psychology , personality psychology , developmental psychology , social cognition , judgment and decision making , motivation science Institutions Columbia University (1989-present) Columbia Business School (2002-present) New York University (1981–1989) University of Western Ontario (1977–1981) Princeton University (1972–1977) Edward Tory Higgins (born March 12, 1946) is the Stanley Schachter Professor of Psychology and Business, [ 1 ] and Director of the Motivation Science Center [ 2 ] at Columbia University . Higgins' research areas include motivation and cognition , judgment and decision-making , and social cognition . Most of his works focus on priming , self-discrepancy theory , and regulatory focus theory . He is also the author of Beyond Pleasure and Pain: How Motivation Works, [ 3 ] and Focus: Use Different Ways of Seeing the World for Success and Influence (with Heidi Grant Halvorson ).

[ 4 ] Career [ edit ] Higgins received a Joint Honors B.A.

degree in sociology and anthropology from McGill University in 1967, an M.A.

in social psychology from the London School of Economics and Political Science in 1968, and a Ph.D.

in psychology from Columbia University in 1973. His early work included the study of priming and accessibility, through which social judgment is influenced through the unconscious activation of social categories.

[ 5 ] In 1981, he was employed by New York University , where he collaborated with fellow colleagues to reconstruct the social/personality psychology program. In 1989, Higgins returned to Columbia and assumed the role of Chair of the psychology department from 1994 to 2001.

At Columbia University , Higgins conducted research on the science of motivation and self-regulation. He further developed his previous research on self-discrepancy theory, exploring the gaps individuals perceive between their actual selves and the standards set by their "ideal" or "ought" self-guides.

[ 6 ] Based on self-discrepancy theory, Higgins then developed regulatory focus theory , which posits two distinct self-regulatory systems for approaching goals: achieving gains (promotion) and avoiding losses (prevention).

[ 7 ] In 2000, Higgins developed regulatory fit theory, proposing that people experience fit when using means of goal pursuit that align with their regulatory orientation: vigilant or eager.

[ 8 ] Also in 2000, Higgins and Arie Kruglanski developed regulatory mode theory , which describes two complementary self-regulatory functions: assessment and locomotion.

[ 9 ] These theories have also informed the development of Higgins' model of motivational effectiveness, which posits that motivation comprises distinct drives for value (achieving desired end-states), truth (understanding what's real), and control (managing what happens).

[ 3 ] [ 10 ] Higgins has also studied shared reality, the motivation to create shared feelings, beliefs, and concerns with others.

[ 11 ] Selected awards [ edit ] Higgins is a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences .

[ 12 ] He gave the University Lecture at Columbia University and received Columbia's Presidential Award for Outstanding Teaching .

[ 13 ] He is a member of the Society for Personality and Social Psychology Wall of Fame [ 14 ] and was recently awarded the Ambady Award for Mentoring Excellence ( Society for Personality and Social Psychology ).

[ 15 ] Selected additional awards include: Anneliese Maier Research Award 2016 [ 16 ] Lifetime Contribution Award (2005) from the International Society for Self & Identity [ 17 ] Distinguished Scientist Award (2005) from the Society of Experimental Social Psychology [ 18 ] Award for Distinguished Scientific Contributions (2000) from the American Psychological Association [ 19 ] William James Fellow Award (2000) from the Association for Psychological Science for distinguished achievements in psychological science [ 20 ] Thomas M. Ostrom Award (1999) from the Person Memory Interest Group for outstanding contributions to social cognition [ 21 ] Donald T. Campbell Award (1996) from the Society for Personality and Social Psychology for outstanding contributions to social psychology [ 22 ] Selected publications [ edit ] Books [ edit ] Grant Halvorson, H., & Higgins, E.
