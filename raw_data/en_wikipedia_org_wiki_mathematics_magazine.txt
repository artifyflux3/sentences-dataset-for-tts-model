Language English Website http://www.maa.org/pubs/mathmag.html ISSN 0025-570X Mathematics Magazine is a refereed bimonthly publication of the Mathematical Association of America . Its intended audience is teachers of collegiate mathematics, especially at the junior/senior level, and their students. It is explicitly a journal of mathematics rather than pedagogy. Rather than articles in the terse "theorem-proof" style of research journals, it seeks articles which provide a context for the mathematics they deliver, with examples, applications, illustrations, and historical background.

[ 2 ] Paid circulation in 2008 was 9,500 and total circulation was 10,000.

[ 3 ] Mathematics Magazine is a continuation of Mathematics News Letter (1926–1934) and National Mathematics Magazine (1934–1945).

[ 4 ] Doris Schattschneider became the first female editor of Mathematics Magazine in 1981.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] The MAA gives the Carl B. Allendoerfer Awards annually "for articles of expository excellence" published in Mathematics Magazine .
