The term "bench" is also used as a metonym to mean all the judges of a certain court or members of a judiciary.

The Supreme Court of Japan Grand Bench seats 15 justices.

Bench used in a legal context can have several meanings. First, it can simply indicate the location in a courtroom where a judge sits.  Second, the term bench is a metonym used to describe members of the judiciary collectively, [ 1 ] or the judges of a particular court, such as the King's Bench or the Common Bench in England and Wales, or the federal bench in the United States.

[ 2 ] Third, the term is used to differentiate judges, who are referred to as "the bench", from attorneys or barristers , who are referred to as " the bar ". The phrase "bench and bar" denotes all judges and lawyers collectively.

[ 2 ] The term "full bench" is used when all the judges of a certain court sit together to hear a case, as in the phrase "before the full bench", which is also referred to as en banc .

[ 3 ] The historical roots of the term come from judges formerly having sat on long seats or benches (freestanding or against a wall) when presiding over a court .

[ 2 ] The bench is usually an elevated desk area that allows a judge to view, and to be seen by, the entire courtroom. The bench was a typical feature of the courts of the Order of St. John in Malta, such as at the Castellania , where judges and the nominated College of Advocates sat for court cases and review laws.
