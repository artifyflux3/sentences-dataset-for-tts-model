Designed in the brutalist style [ 1 ] and constructed in 1964, the complex includes perimeter buildings standing at three to seven stories, and three interior 22-story towers.

[ 2 ] It has been described as "beloved by architects and disliked by almost everyone else." [ 3 ] Description [ edit ] Peabody Terrace was completed in 1965 at a cost of $8.5 million.

[ 2 ] On 5.9 acres (2.4 ha), the 650,000-square-foot (60,000 m 2 ) complex consists of about 500 apartments (a mixture of "efficiencies" and one-, two-, and three-bedroom units‍—‌all with 7-foot-6-inch (2.3 m) ceilings) plus playgrounds, nurseries, roof terraces, laundromats/laundry rooms, meetings/seminar rooms, study rooms, and a parking garage.

[ 2 ] In order to maximize usable floor space and speed vertical transportation, the towers' elevators stop on every third floor.

[ 4 ] The Harvard-affiliated Peabody Terrace Children's Center is housed on the complex grounds.

Reception [ edit ] In the words of architecture critic Robert Campbell , the exterior reflects the desire of its designer, Harvard Graduate School of Design Dean Josep Lluís Sert , to "bring the color and life of the Mediterranean to the white cubist architecture of northern Europe".

[ 2 ] It has also been called "an extension of Le Corbusier 's communal prototype, the Unité d'Habitation ".

[ 5 ] Originally designated as housing for married students, the partially completed project appeared in a Harvard Crimson photo over the caption, "University Moves to Thwart Early Marriages", and the Crimson later called it "well on the way to being just as hideous" as another Sert-designed building, Harvard's new administrative high-rise Holyoke Center .

[ 6 ] Nonetheless it received the Boston Society of Architects' Harleston Parker Medal and the American Institute of Architects Gold Medal .

[ 2 ] In 1965 Progressive Architecture said Sert had achieved  "an efficiently workable interior arrangement, a lively sequence of exterior spaces, and a fluent continuity from low to high, and from old to new structures." [ 7 ] But by 1994 the same publication saw Peabody Terrace as "an embarrassment to Harvard, and the last resort of graduate students who couldn’t find a better place to live." [ 8 ] (The living units were renovated between 1993 and 1995 and the common areas overhauled in 2013.
