Although it is commonly traced back to early Lutheranism , [ 2 ] [ 3 ] the doctrine is also discussed within Reformed Christianity [ 4 ] as well as modern Judaism .

[ 5 ] During the 1930s–1940s rise of European neo-orthodoxy , the meaning of this doctrine in regard to the foundations of church and state (e.g., how its interpretation by 19th-century German theologians may have aided in legitimizing the then-contemporary Nazi party or how it would support the reality or non-reality of natural law ) came into dispute amongst such famed theologians as Karl Barth , [ 6 ] Emil Brunner , [ 2 ] and Dietrich Bonhoeffer .

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] Though a specific 1934 controversy between Brunner and Barth over the interpretations of the doctrines of natural law and the orders of creation [ 9 ] was not inherently political, Barth alleged that Brunner's position gave credibility to pro-Nazi " German Christians ".
