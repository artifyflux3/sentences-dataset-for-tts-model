Beginning with her 1991 pioneering essay 'U.S. Third World Feminism: The Theory and Method of Oppositional Consciousness in the Postmodern World', [ 2 ] Sandoval emerged as a significant voice [ among whom?

] for women of color and decolonial feminism.

[ 3 ] Personal life [ edit ] Sandoval was born and raised in San Jose, California .

[ 4 ] She has described her working-class parents as a "machinist/philosopher father", Jose Machlavio Lucero-Sandoval and a "warehouse-fork-lift driver/spiritual-activist mother", Pearl Antonia Doria-Sandoval.  She has four sisters, Janet, Robin, Sandy and Julie.

[ 5 ] Education [ edit ] Sandoval received a bachelor of arts and a bachelor of science from UC Santa Cruz.  She became interested in feminism in 1971 when she enrolled in a course "Women in Literature".  As a result of this course, she became involved in the Santa Cruz Women's Media Collective, a group that made television programming for a local public access channel.  In 1978, Sandoval moved to New York to intern at ABC News , a position arranged for her by Barbara Walters .  However, ultimately Sandoval decided to pursue a doctorate rather than documentary film career.  In a 2005 interview, Sandoval explained her decision as motivated by a desire to make activism more effective.

"I felt the activism was...frustrating; we were repeating the same practices over and over again. I really needed to think about what we were committing our lives to, to see if there was another way to make positive social change. That's when I applied to HistCon to learn from activist- theorists and philosophers, in those early stages." [ 6 ] Her professors in the History of Consciousness program included Stephen Heath , Teresa de Lauretis , Vivian Sobchack and Janey Place .

[ 7 ] She has cited Hayden White, Donna Haraway, James Clifford and Teresa de Lauretis as her mentors at Santa Cruz.

[ 8 ] Although she initially intended to write a dissertation on women and video, Sandoval's reading led her to philosophy.  Her dissertation developed her first major theoretical contribution, the idea of oppositional consciousness.

[ 9 ] Even as a graduate student, Sandoval played an important role in US feminism.  She wrote a report on behalf of the Third World Women's Alliance following a divisive splintering around the 1981 National Women's Studies Association conference's theme of women and racism.

[ 10 ] [ 11 ] Theories [ edit ] Her most important work, Methodology of the Oppressed , developed fully her idea of a differential oppositional consciousness, a mode of "ideology-praxis" rooted in the experiences of US Third World  that resists binary categories of identity in favor of a fluidity that moves between them.

[ 12 ] She credits Frederic Jameson with recognizing the idea of oppositional consciousness in her work and encouraging her to develop it, [ 13 ] although her work is both a critique of and extension of Jameson's own work.

[ 14 ] Sandoval's work has been widely influential within second wave feminism and her notion of oppositional consciousness is central to Donna Haraway 's cyborg feminism .  However the concept has been adopted by scholars working in many fields.

[ 15 ] In more recent years, Sandoval has joined her earlier interests in culture with her work on oppositional consciousness to focus on what she terms artivism , a neologism she developed with Guisella LaTorre to describe activist art.

[ 16 ] Sandoval has proposed anti-gender feminism as a type of feminism which regards gender as a harmful social construct based on the model of anti-racism discourse.

[ 17 ] Sandoval is included in Brown University's Feminist Theory Archives.
