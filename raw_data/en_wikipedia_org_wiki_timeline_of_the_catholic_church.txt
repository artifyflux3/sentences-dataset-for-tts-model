It is also, according to church historian Mark A. Noll , the "world's oldest continuously functioning international institution." [ 1 ] This article covers a period of just under two thousand years.

Over time, schisms have disrupted the unity of Christianity. The Catholic Church considers that major divisions occurred in c. 144 with Marcionism , [ 2 ] 318 with Arianism , 451 with the Oriental Orthodox , 1054 to 1449 (see East–West Schism ) during which time the Orthodox Churches of the East parted ways with the Western Church over doctrinal issues (see the filioque ) and papal primacy , and in 1517 with the Protestant Reformation , of which there were many divisions, resulting in over 200 denominations.

The Catholic Church has been the driving force behind some of the major events of world history including the Christianization of Western and Central Europe and Latin America , the spreading of literacy and the foundation of the universities, hospitals, the Western tradition of monasticism , the development of art and music, literature, architecture, contributions to the scientific method , just war theory and trial by jury . It has played a powerful role in global affairs, including the Reconquista , the Crusades , the Inquisition , the Investiture Controversy , the establishment of the Holy Roman Empire , and the Fall of Communism in Eastern Europe in the late 20th century.

He was then crucified under Pontius Pilate. According to his followers, three days later, He rose from the dead. Forty days after his resurrection ( Ascension ), the Christian Gospels narrate that Jesus instructed his disciples thus: "All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth. Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of time." (Matthew 28:18–20). Ten days later ( Pentecost ) Peter makes the first sermon, converting 3,000 to be baptized.
