Watson Charles Gabriel Kurland (born 14 January 1936) is an American-born Swedish biochemist.

Kurland earned a doctorate in 1961 at Harvard University , advised by James D. Watson .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Kurland accepted a postdoctoral research position at the Microbiology Institute of the University of Copenhagen , then joined the Uppsala University faculty in 1971.

[ 2 ] He retired from Uppsala in 2001, and was granted emeritus status.

[ 3 ] He was later affiliated with Lund University .

[ 2 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Research [ edit ] Kurland's doctoral work dealt the structure of RNA, [ 6 ] and continued with the discovery of messenger RNA (mRNA), work that also involved François Gros , Walter Gilbert and James Watson .

[ 7 ] This was published simultaneously with the report by Sydney Brenner , François Jacob and Matthew Meselson of the same discovery.

[ 8 ] It was followed by numerous papers concerned with ribosomal proteins [ 9 ] [ 10 ] In the later part of his career Kurland has been interested in the origins of mitochondria [ 11 ] and the tree of life.

[ 12 ] Academy memberships [ edit ] Kurland was elected to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1988 as a foreign member, and reclassified as a Swedish member in 2002.

[ 13 ] The Estonian Academy of Sciences recognized his achievements in biochemistry, and awarded Kurland an equivalent honor in 1991.
