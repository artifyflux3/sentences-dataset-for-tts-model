David Merritt David Merritt Born ( 1955-11-16 ) November 16, 1955 (age 69) Alma mater Princeton University Known for Leonard–Merritt mass estimator Osipkov–Merritt model M–sigma relation Scientific career Fields Astrophysics Institutions Rochester Institute of Technology Center for Computational Relativity and Gravitation Doctoral advisor Jeremiah P. Ostriker David Roy Merritt (born November 16, 1955, in Los Angeles) is an American astrophysicist . He is known for Osipkov–Merritt model , the Leonard–Merritt mass estimator and the M–sigma relation .

Education and career [ edit ] He received in 1982 his PhD in Astrophysical Sciences from Princeton University with thesis advisor Jeremiah P. Ostriker [ 1 ] and held postdoctoral positions at the University of California, Berkeley and the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics in Toronto .  Merritt's fields of specialization include dynamics and evolution of galaxies , supermassive black holes , and computational astrophysics.

Until 2017, he was a professor at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) in Rochester , New York . He was a former Chair of the Division on Dynamical Astronomy of the American Astronomical Society . He is a founding member of the Center for Computational Relativity and Gravitation at RIT.

His scientific contributions include Osipkov–Merritt models , [ 2 ] black hole spin flips , [ 3 ] the Leonard–Merritt mass estimator , [ 4 ] the M–sigma relation , [ 5 ] stellar systems with negative temperatures, [ 6 ] and the Schwarzschild barrier.
