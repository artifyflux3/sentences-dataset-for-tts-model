It is bordered by the Northern Territory , South Australia and New South Wales to the west, south-west and south, respectively. To the east, Queensland is bordered by the Coral Sea and the Pacific Ocean ; to the state's north is the Torres Strait , separating the Australian mainland from Papua New Guinea , and the Gulf of Carpentaria to the north-west. With an area of 1,723,030 square kilometres (665,270 sq mi), Queensland is the world's sixth-largest subnational entity ; it is larger than all but 16 countries . Due to its size, Queensland's geographical features and climates are diverse, and include tropical rainforests , rivers , coral reefs , mountain ranges and white sandy beaches in its tropical and sub-tropical coastal regions, as well as deserts and savanna in the semi-arid and desert climatic regions of its interior .

Queensland has a population of over 5.5 million, [ 9 ] concentrated in South East Queensland , where nearly three in four reside. The capital and largest city in the state is Brisbane , Australia's third-largest city and comprising fully half of the state’s population. Ten of Australia's thirty largest cities are located in Queensland, the largest outside Brisbane being the Gold Coast , the Sunshine Coast , Townsville , Cairns , Ipswich , and Toowoomba . 24.2% of the state's population were born overseas .

[ 10 ] The state has the highest inter-state net migration in Australia.

[ 11 ] Queensland was first inhabited by Aboriginal Australians , with the Torres Strait Islands inhabited by Torres Strait Islanders .

[ 12 ] Dutch navigator Willem Janszoon , the first European to land in Australia, explored the west coast of the Cape York Peninsula in 1606. In 1770, James Cook claimed the east coast of Australia for the Kingdom of Great Britain . In 1788, Arthur Phillip founded the colony of New South Wales, which included all of what is now Queensland. Queensland was explored in subsequent decades, and the Moreton Bay Penal Settlement was established at Brisbane in 1824 by John Oxley . During the Australian frontier wars of the 19th century, colonists killed tens of thousands of Aboriginal people in Queensland while consolidating their control over the territory.

On 6 June 1859 (now commemorated as Queensland Day ), Queen Victoria signed the letters patent to establish the colony of Queensland, separating it from New South Wales and thereby establishing Queensland as a self-governing Crown colony with responsible government . A large part of colonial Queensland's economy relied on blackbirded South Sea Islander slavery.

[ citation needed ] Queensland was among the six colonies which became the founding states of Australia with Federation on 1 January 1901. Since the Bjelke-Petersen era of the late 20th century, Queensland has received a high level of internal migration from the other states and territories of Australia and remains a popular destination for interstate migration.

Queensland has the third-largest economy among Australian states, with strengths in mining, agriculture, transportation, international education , insurance, and banking. Nicknamed the Sunshine State for its tropical and sub-tropical climates, Great Barrier Reef , and numerous beaches, tourism is also important to the state's economy.

History [ edit ] Main article: History of Queensland Pre-European contact [ edit ] Main article: History of Indigenous Australians Queensland was one of the largest regions of pre-colonial Aboriginal population in Australia.

[ 13 ] The Aboriginal ownership of Queensland is thought to predate 50,000 BC, and early migrants are believed to have arrived via boat or land bridge across Torres Strait . Through time, their descendants developed into more than 90 different language and cultural groups.

During the last ice age , Queensland's landscape became more arid and largely desolate, making food and other supplies scarce. The people developed the world's first seed-grinding technology.

[ 14 ] The end of the glacial period brought about a warming climate, making the land more hospitable. It brought high rainfall along the eastern coast, stimulating the growth of the state's tropical rainforests.

[ 15 ] The Torres Strait Islands is home to the Torres Strait Islander peoples . Torres Strait Islanders are ethnically and culturally distinct from mainland Aboriginal peoples. They have a long history of interaction with both Aboriginal peoples of what is now Australia and the peoples of New Guinea .

European colonisation [ edit ] Captain James Cook claims the east coast of Australia for the Kingdom of Great Britain at Possession Island in 1770 The peninsula of Seventeen Seventy, Queensland , where Captain Cook landed in 1770 Fighting between Burke and Wills 's supply party and Aboriginal Australians at Bulla in 1861 In February 1606, Dutch navigator Willem Janszoon landed near the site of what is now Weipa , on the western shore of Cape York . This was the first recorded landing of a European in Australia , and it also marked the first reported contact between Europeans and the Aboriginal people of Australia .

[ 15 ] The region was also explored by French and Spanish explorers (commanded by Louis Antoine de Bougainville and Luís Vaez de Torres , respectively) before the arrival of Lieutenant James Cook in 1770. Cook claimed the east coast under instruction from King George III of the Kingdom of Great Britain on 22 August 1770 at Possession Island , naming eastern Australia, including Queensland, New South Wales .

[ 16 ] The Aboriginal population declined significantly after a smallpox epidemic during the late 18th century and massacres by the European settlers.

[ 17 ] [ page needed ] In 1823, John Oxley , a British explorer, sailed north from what is now Sydney to scout possible penal colony sites in Gladstone (then Port Curtis ) and Moreton Bay . At Moreton Bay, he found the Brisbane River . He returned in 1824 and established a penal settlement at what is now Redcliffe . The settlement, initially known as Edenglassie , was then transferred to the current location of the Brisbane city centre .

Edmund Lockyer discovered outcrops of coal along the banks of the upper Brisbane River in 1825.

[ 18 ] In 1839 transportation of convicts was ceased, culminating in the closure of the Brisbane penal settlement. In 1842 free settlement, which had already commenced, was officially permitted. In 1847, the Port of Maryborough was opened as a wool port. While most early immigrants came from New South Wales, the first free immigrant ship to arrive in Moreton Bay from Europe was the Artemisia , in 1848.

Earlier than this immigrant ship was the arrival of the Irish famine orphan girls to Queensland. Devised by the then British Secretary of State for the Colonies, The Earl Grey Scheme established a special emigration scheme which was designed to resettle destitute girls from the workhouses of Ireland during the Great Famine. The first ship, the "Earl Grey", departed Ireland for a 124-day sail to Sydney. After controversy developed upon their arrival in Australia, a small group of 37 young orphans, sometimes referred to as The Belfast Girls or the Feisty Colleens, never set foot on Sydney soil, and instead sailed up to Brisbane (then Moreton Bay) on 21 October 1848 on board the Ann Mary . This scheme continued until 1852.

[ 19 ] In 1857, Queensland's first lighthouse was built at Cape Moreton .

[ 20 ] Frontier wars and massacres [ edit ] Further information: Australian frontier wars § Queensland , and List of massacres of Indigenous Australians § Queensland The frontier wars fought between European settlers and Aboriginal tribes in Queensland were the bloodiest and most brutal in colonial Australia.

[ 21 ] Many of these conflicts are now seen as acts of genocide.

[ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] The wars featured the most frequent massacres of First Nations people, the three deadliest massacres on white settlers, the most disreputable frontier police force, and the highest number of white victims to frontier violence on record in any Australian colony.

[ 26 ] Across at least 644 collisions at least 66,680 were killed — with Aboriginal fatalities alone comprising no less than 65,180.

[ 27 ] Of these deaths, around 24,000 Aboriginal men, women and children were killed by the Native Police between 1859 and 1897.

[ 28 ] The military force of the Queensland Government in this war was the Native Police , who operated from 1849 to the 1920s. The Native Police was a body of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander troopers that operated under the command of white officers. The Native Police were often recruited forcefully from far-away communities.

[ 29 ] [ 30 ] Aftermath of the 1861 Cullin-La-Ringo massacre in which 19 settlers were killed by Aboriginal people, the deadliest attack on settlers in the frontier wars Conflict spread quickly with free settlement in 1838, with settlement rapidly expanding in a great rush to take up the surrounding land in the Darling Downs , Logan and Brisbane Valley and South Burnett onwards from 1840, in many cases leading to widespread fighting and heavy loss of life. The conflict later spread north to the Wide Bay and Burnett River and Hervey Bay region, and at one stage the settlement of Maryborough was virtually under siege.

[ 31 ] The largest reasonably well-documented massacres in southeast Queensland were the Kilcoy and Whiteside poisonings, each of which was said to have taken up to 70 Aboriginal lives by use of a gift of flour laced with strychnine . At the Battle of One Tree Hill in September 1843, Multuggerah and his group of warriors ambushed one group of settlers, routing them and subsequently others in the skirmishes which followed, starting in retaliation for the Kilcoy poisoning.

[ 32 ] [ 33 ] Central Queensland was particularly hard hit during the 1860s and 1870s, several contemporary writers mention the Skull Hole, Bladensburg, or Mistake Creek massacre [ a ] on Bladensburg Station near Winton , which in 1901 was said to have taken up to 200 Aboriginal lives.

[ 34 ] First Nations warriors killed 19 settlers during the Cullin-La-Ringo massacre on 17 October 1861.

[ 35 ] In the weeks afterwards, police, native police and civilians killed up to 370 members of the Gayiri Aboriginal people in response.

[ 36 ] Frontier violence peaked on the northern mining frontier during the 1870s, most notably in Cook district and on the Palmer and Hodgkinson River goldfields, with heavy loss of Aboriginal lives and several well-known massacres.

[ 37 ] Raids conducted by the Kalkadoon held settlers out of Western Queensland for ten years until September 1884 when they attacked a force of settlers and native police at Battle Mountain near modern Cloncurry . The subsequent battle of Battle Mountain ended in disaster for the Kalkadoon, who suffered heavy losses.

[ 38 ] Fighting continued in North Queensland , however, with First Nations raiders attacking sheep and cattle while Native Police mounted heavy retaliatory massacres.

[ 39 ] [ 40 ] Blackbirding [ edit ] Further information: Blackbirding § Queensland Tens of thousands of South Sea Islanders were forced, deceived or coerced into indentured servitude and slavery on Australia's agricultural plantations, despite slavery being outlawed in Australia and other parts of the British Empire by the Slavery Abolition Act 1833 . This process was known as blackbirding.

[ 41 ] [ 42 ] [ 43 ] This trade in what were then known as Kanakas was in operation from 1863 to 1908, a period of 45 years. Some 55,000 to 62,500 were brought to Australia,  most being recruited or blackbirded from islands in Melanesia , such as the New Hebrides (now Vanuatu ), the Solomon Islands and the islands around New Guinea .

[ 44 ] Blackbirded South Sea Islanders on a Sugarcane plantation in Queensland.

The majority of those taken were male and around one quarter were under the age of sixteen.

[ 45 ] In total, approximately 15,000 South Sea Islanders (30%) died while labouring in Queensland – excluding those who died in transit or were killed in the recruitment process – mostly during three-year contracts.

[ 46 ] This is similar to the estimated 33% death rate among enslaved Africans in the first three years of arriving in America, [ 47 ] Brazil, and the Caribbean; the conditions were often comparable to those of the Atlantic slave trade .

[ 42 ] [ 41 ] The trade was legally sanctioned and regulated under Queensland law, and prominent men such as Robert Towns made massive fortunes through blackbirding, helping to establish some of the major cities in Queensland today.

[ 48 ] Towns' agent claimed that blackbirded labourers were "savages who did not know the use of money" and therefore did not deserve cash wages.

[ 49 ] Following Federation in 1901, the White Australia policy came into effect, which saw most foreign workers in Australia deported under the Pacific Island Labourers Act 1901 , which saw the Pacific Islander population of the state decrease rapidly.

[ 50 ] Independent governance [ edit ] Further information: Colony of Queensland Parade of troops in Brisbane, prior to departure for the Boer War in South Africa Kanaka workers in a sugar cane plantation, late 19th century A public meeting was held in 1851 to consider the proposed separation of Queensland from New South Wales. On 6 June 1859, Queen Victoria signed letters patent [ 51 ] to form the separate colony of Queensland as a self-governing Crown colony with responsible government .

Brisbane was selected as the capital city. On 10 December 1859, a proclamation was read by George Bowen , the first Governor of Queensland , formally establishing Queensland as a separate colony from New South Wales.

[ 52 ] On 22 May 1860 the first Queensland election was held and Robert Herbert , Bowen's private secretary, was appointed as the first Premier of Queensland .

In 1865, the first rail line in the state opened between Ipswich and Grandchester . Queensland's economy expanded rapidly in 1867 after James Nash discovered gold on the Mary River near the town of Gympie , sparking a gold rush and saving the Colony of Queensland from near economic collapse. While still significant, they were on a much smaller scale than the gold rushes of Victoria and New South Wales.

Immigration to Australia and Queensland, in particular, began in the 1850s to support the state economy. During the period from the 1860s until the early 20th century, many labourers, known at the time as Kanakas , were brought to Queensland from neighbouring Pacific Island nations to work in the state's sugar cane fields. Some of these people had been kidnapped under a process known as blackbirding or press-ganging, and their employment conditions constituted an allegedly exploitative form of indentured labour.

Italian immigrants entered the sugar cane industry from the 1890s.

[ 53 ] During the 1890s, the six Australian colonies, including Queensland, held a series of referendums which culminated in the Federation of Australia on 1 January 1901. During this time, Queensland had a population of half a million people. Since then, Queensland has remained a federated state within Australia, and its population has significantly grown.

20th century [ edit ] Returned World War II soldiers march in Queen Street, Brisbane, 1944 In 1905 women voted in state elections for the first time. The state's first university, the University of Queensland , was established in Brisbane in 1909. In 1911, the first alternative treatments for polio were pioneered in Queensland and remain in use across the world today.

[ 54 ] World War I had a major impact on Queensland . Over 58,000 Queenslanders fought in World War I and over 10,000 of them died.

[ 55 ] Australia's first major airline, Qantas (originally standing for "Queensland and Northern Territory Aerial Services"), was founded in Winton in 1920 to serve outback Queensland.

In 1922 Queensland abolished the Queensland Legislative Council , becoming the only Australian state with a unicameral parliament .

In 1935 cane toads were deliberately introduced to Queensland from Hawaii in an unsuccessful attempt to reduce the number of French's cane and greyback cane beetles that were destroying the roots of sugar cane plants, which are integral to Queensland's economy. The toads have remained an environmental pest since that time. In 1962, the first commercial production of oil in Queensland and Australia began at Moonie .

During World War II Brisbane became central to the Allied campaign when the AMP Building (now called MacArthur Central ) was used as the South West Pacific headquarters for General Douglas MacArthur , chief of the Allied Pacific forces, until his headquarters were moved to Hollandia in August 1944.

[ 56 ] In 1942, during the war, Brisbane was the site of a violent clash between visiting US military personnel and Australian servicemen and civilians, which resulted in one death and hundreds of injuries. This incident became known colloquially as the Battle of Brisbane .

[ 57 ] The end of World War II saw a wave of immigration from across Europe, with many more immigrants coming from southern and eastern Europe than in previous decades.

In the later decades of the 20th century, the humid subtropical climate —regulated by the availability of air conditioning—saw Queensland become a popular destination for migrants from interstate.

[ 58 ] Since that time, Queensland has continuously seen high levels of migration from the other states and territories of Australia.

In 1966, Lyndon B. Johnson became the first U.S. president to visit Queensland. During his visit, he met with Australia prime minister Harold Holt .

[ citation needed ] The end of the White Australia policy in 1973 saw the beginning of a wave of immigration from around the world, and most prominently from Asia, which continues to the present.

In 1981 the Great Barrier Reef off Queensland's northeast coast, one of the world's largest coral reef systems, was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site .

21st century [ edit ] In 2003 Queensland adopted maroon as the state's official colour. The announcement was made as a result of an informal tradition to use maroon to represent the state in association with sporting events.

[ 59 ] After three decades of record population growth, Queensland was impacted by major floods between late 2010 and early 2011 , causing extensive damage and disruption across the state.

[ 60 ] [ 61 ] In 2020, Queensland was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic . Despite a low number and abrupt decline in cases from April 2020 onward, social distancing requirements were implemented from March 2020 including the closure of the state borders.

Geography [ edit ] Main article: Geography of Queensland Commonly designated regions of Queensland , with Central Queensland divided into Mackay and Fitzroy subregions The Great Barrier Reef , which extends along most of Queensland's Coral Sea coastline The Mossman River , flowing through the Daintree Rainforest in Far North Queensland The McPherson Range at Lamington National Park in South East Queensland Lake McKensie, K'gari (Fraser Island) With a total area of 1,729,742 square kilometres (715,309 square miles), Queensland is an expansive state with a highly diverse range of climates and geographical features. If Queensland were an independent nation, it would be the world's 16th largest.

Queensland's eastern coastline borders the Coral Sea , an arm of the Pacific Ocean. The state is bordered by the Torres Strait to the north, with Boigu Island off the coast of New Guinea representing the northern extreme of its territory. The triangular Cape York Peninsula , which points toward New Guinea, is the northernmost part of the state's mainland. West of the peninsula's tip, northern Queensland is bordered by the Gulf of Carpentaria . To the west, Queensland is bordered by the Northern Territory , at the 138th meridian east , and to the southwest by northeastern South Australia . The state's southern border with New South Wales is constituted in the east by the watershed from Point Danger to the Dumaresq River , and the Dumaresq, Macintyre and Barwon rivers. The west of the southern border is defined by the 29th parallel south (including some minor historical encroachments ) until it reaches South Australia.

Like much of eastern Australia, the Great Dividing Range runs roughly parallel with, and inland from, the coast, and areas west of the range are more arid than the humid coastal regions. The Great Barrier Reef , which is the world's largest coral reef system, runs parallel to the state's Coral Sea coast between the Torres Strait and K'gari (Fraser Island) . Queensland's coastline includes the world's three largest sand islands: K'gari (Fraser Island) , Moreton , and North Stradbroke .

The state contains six World Heritage -listed preservation areas: the Great Barrier Reef along the Coral Sea coast, K'gari (Fraser Island) on the Wide Bay–Burnett region's coastline, the wet tropics in Far North Queensland including the Daintree Rainforest , Lamington National Park in South East Queensland , the Riversleigh fossil sites in North West Queensland , and the Gondwana Rainforests in South East Queensland.

The state is divided into several unofficial regions which are commonly used to refer to large areas of the state's vast geography. These include: South East Queensland in the state's coastal extreme south-eastern corner, an urban region which includes the state's three largest cities: capital city Brisbane and popular coastal tourist destinations the Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast . In some definitions, it also includes the city of Toowoomba . South East Queensland accounts for more than 70% of the state's population.

The Darling Downs in the state's inland southeast, which consists of fertile agricultural (particularly cattle grazing) land and in some definitions includes the city of Toowoomba. The region also includes the mountainous Granite Belt , the state's coldest region which occasionally experiences snow.

Wide Bay–Burnett in the state's coastal southeast, to the north of the South East Queensland region. It is rich in sugar cane farms and includes the cities of Bundaberg , Hervey Bay as well as K'gari (Fraser Island) , the world's largest sand island.

Central Queensland on the state's central coastline, which is dominated by cattle farmland and coal mining. It contains the Capricorn Coast and Whitsunday Islands tourist regions, as well as the cities of Rockhampton and Mackay .

North Queensland on the state's northern coastline, which is dominated by cattle farmland and mining and which includes the city of Townsville .

Far North Queensland on the state's extreme northern coastline along the Cape York Peninsula , which includes tropical rainforest , the state's highest mountain, Mount Bartle Frere , the Atherton Tablelands pastoral region (dominated by sugar cane and tropical fruits ), the most visited section of the Great Barrier Reef , as well as the city of Cairns .

South West Queensland in the state's inland south-west, which is a primarily agricultural region dominated by cattle farmland, and which includes the Channel Country region of intertwining rivulets .

Central West Queensland in the state's inland central-west, dominated by cattle farmland and which includes the city of Longreach .

The Gulf Country (also known as North West Queensland), in the state's inland north-west along the Gulf of Carpentaria , which is dominated by savanna and mining and includes the city of Mount Isa .

Climate [ edit ] Köppen climate types in Queensland Because of its size, there is significant variation in climate across the state. There is ample rainfall along the coastline, with a monsoonal wet season in the tropical north, and humid sub-tropical conditions along the southern coastline. Low rainfall and hot humid summers are typical for the inland and west. Elevated areas in the south-eastern inland can experience temperatures well below freezing in mid-winter providing frost and, rarely, snowfall . The climate of the coastal regions is influenced by warm ocean waters, keeping the region free from extremes of temperature and providing moisture for rainfall.

[ 62 ] There are six predominant climatic zones in Queensland, [ 63 ] based on temperature and humidity: Hot humid summer, warm humid winter (far north and coastal): Cairns , Innisfail Hot humid summer, warm dry winter (north and coastal): Townsville , Mackay Hot humid summer, mild dry winter (coastal elevated areas and coastal south-east): Brisbane , Bundaberg , Rockhampton Hot dry summer, mild dry winter (central inland and north-west): Mt Isa , Emerald , Longreach Hot dry summer, cool dry winter (southern inland): Roma , Charleville , Goondiwindi Warm humid summer, cold dry winter (elevated south-eastern areas): Toowoomba , Warwick , Stanthorpe The annual average climatic statistics [ 64 ] for selected Queensland cities are shown below: City Mean daily min. temp Mean daily max. temp No. clear days Rainfall Brisbane 15.7 °C (60.3 °F) 25.5 °C (77.9 °F) 113.1 1,149.1 mm (45.24 in) [ 65 ] Mackay 19.0 °C (66.2 °F) 26.4 °C (79.5 °F) 123.0 1,570.7 mm (61.84 in) [ 66 ] Cairns 21.0 °C (69.8 °F) 29.2 °C (84.6 °F) 89.7 1,982.2 mm (78.04 in) [ 67 ] Townsville 19.8 °C (67.6 °F) 28.9 °C (84.0 °F) 120.9 1,136.7 mm (44.75 in) [ 68 ] The coastal far north of the state is the wettest region in Australia, with Mount Bellenden Ker , south of Cairns, holding many Australian rainfall records with its annual average rainfall of over 8 metres (26 ft).

[ 69 ] Snow is rare in Queensland, although it does fall with some regularity along the far southern border with New South Wales, predominantly in the Stanthorpe district although on rare occasions further north and west. The most northerly snow ever recorded in Australia occurred near Mackay ; however, this was exceptional.

[ 70 ] Natural disasters are often a threat in Queensland: severe tropical cyclones can impact the central and northern coastlines and cause severe damage, [ 71 ] with recent examples including Larry , Yasi , Ita and Debbie . Flooding from rain-bearing systems can also be severe and can occur anywhere in Queensland. One of the deadliest and most damaging floods in the history of the state occurred in early 2011 .

[ 72 ] Severe springtime thunderstorms generally affect the south-east and inland of the state and can bring damaging winds, torrential rain, large hail and even tornadoes .

[ 73 ] The strongest tornado ever recorded in Australia occurred in Queensland near Bundaberg in November 1992.

[ 74 ] Droughts and bushfires can also occur; however, the latter are generally less severe than those that occur in southern states.

[ 116 ] Politics and government [ edit ] Main article: Politics of Queensland Parliament House , seat of the Queensland Parliament Government House , seat of the Governor Queen Elizabeth II Courts of Law , headquarters of the Supreme Court of Queensland and District Court of Queensland One of the six founding states of Australia , Queensland has been a federated state subject to the Australian Constitution since 1 January 1901. It may legislate on all matters not ceded in the Australian Constitution to the federal government . It is a parliamentary constitutional monarchy . The Constitution of Queensland sets out the operation of the state's government. The state's constitution contains several entrenched provisions which cannot be changed in the absence of a referendum . There is also a statutory charter of rights , the Queensland Human Rights Act 2019 . Queensland's system of government is influenced by the Westminster system and Australia's federal system of government .

The government power can be divided into three groups: Legislature: the unicameral Parliament of Queensland , comprising the Legislative Assembly and the Monarch (represented by the Governor ); Executive: the Queensland Government , which consists of the Executive Council of Queensland , which formalises decisions of the Cabinet of Queensland , which is composed of the Premier and other ministers of state appointed by the Governor on the advice of the premier; Judiciary: the Supreme Court and other state courts, whose judges are appointed by the Governor on the advice of Parliament.

Executive authority is nominally vested in the Governor of Queensland (currently Jeannette Young ) who represents and is appointed by the Monarch (currently Charles III ) on the advice of the Premier of Queensland . The Premier, who is the state's Head of government , along with the Cabinet of Queensland (whose decisions are formalised by the Executive Council ), exercise executive authority in practice. The Premier is appointed by the Governor and must have support of the Legislative Assembly of Queensland . The Premier is in practice a leading member of the Legislative Assembly and parliamentary leader of his or her political party, or coalition of parties, and members of the Cabinet will be drawn from the same party or coalition. The current Premier and Deputy Premier are David Crisafulli and Jarrod Bleijie of the Liberal National Party respectively.

Government House at Paddington in Brisbane is the seat of the Governor, having replaced Old Government House at Gardens Point in Brisbane's CBD in the early 20th century. The executive branch is simply referred to as the Queensland Government .

Legislative authority is exercised by the Queensland Parliament which uniquely for Australian states is unicameral , containing only one house, the Legislative Assembly. The Parliament was bicameral until 1922 when the Legislative Council was abolished by the Labor "suicide squad", so called because they were appointed for the purpose of voting to abolish their own offices.

[ 117 ] Bills receive royal assent from the Governor before being passed into law. The Parliament's seat is at Parliament House at Gardens Point in Brisbane's CBD. Members of the Legislative Assembly represent 93 electoral districts . Elections in Queensland are held at the end of each fixed four-year parliamentary term and are determined by full preferential voting .

The state's judiciary consists of the Supreme Court of Queensland and the District Court of Queensland , established by the Queensland Constitution, as well as the Magistrates Court of Queensland and other courts and tribunals established by legislation. Cases may be appealed to the High Court of Australia . As with all Australian states and territories, Queensland has a common law legal system. The Supreme and District courts are headquartered at the Queen Elizabeth II Courts of Law in Brisbane's CBD.

The state's politics are traditionally regarded as being conservative relative to other states.

[ 118 ] [ 119 ] [ 120 ] [ 121 ] [ 122 ] Historically, the lack of an upper house , the " Bjelkemander " (a malapportion favouring rural electoral districts) has meant that Queensland had a long tradition of domination by strong-willed, populist premiers, often accused of authoritarian tendencies, holding office for long periods. This tendency was exemplified by the government of the state's longest-serving Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen .

Local government [ edit ] Main article: Local government in Queensland Local government is the mechanism by which local government areas can manage their own affairs to the extent permitted by the Local Government Act 2009. Queensland is divided into 77 local government areas, which are created by the state government under the legislation.

[ 123 ] Each local government area has a council responsible for providing a range of local services and utilities. Local councils derive their income from both rates and charges on resident ratepayers, and grants and subsidies from the state and federal governments.

Journal of South Pacific Law , 4, pp.7-37: "Between 1863 and 1904, over 62,000 people from the Melanesian archipelagos provided the colony of Queensland with indentured labour for its emerging agricultural industries. [...] Although by the latter nineteenth century, abolitionism had ended both the transatlantic slave trade and slavery in European colonies, indentured labourers (or libres engagés ) were sought as an alternative: working under limited term contracts and wages but otherwise, on occasion, similar conditions to the slaves." ^ a b McDonald, Willa, 2023. "Blackbirding, Subjectivity and the Unseeing 'I'." Literary Journalism in Colonial Australia , pp. 189-216. Cham: Springer International Publishing: "Whether or not the Pacific Island labour trade was a form of slavery is still being debated in Australia. On the one hand, unlike slavery, the indenture contracts were of limited duration, the Islanders were paid, and the rights of the plantation owners over the labourers were extensive 
but not absolute. [...] As Brooke Kroeger says, the blackbirding trade, if not slavery itself, was at least slavery's 'just-as-evil twin'." ^ "General news" .
