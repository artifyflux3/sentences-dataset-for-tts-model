Detail from [Raphael](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raphael "Raphael")'s _[The School of Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_School\_of\_Athens "The School of Athens")_ featuring a Greek mathematician –perhaps representing [Euclid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid "Euclid") or [Archimedes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes "Archimedes")– using a [compass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compass_(drafting) "Compass (drafting)") to draw a geometric construction.

**Euclidean geometry** is a mathematical system attributed to [Euclid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid "Euclid"), an [ancient Greek mathematician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_mathematics "Ancient Greek mathematics"), which he described in his textbook on [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry"), _[Elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s\_Elements "Euclid's Elements")_. Euclid's approach consists in assuming a small set of intuitively appealing [axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom "Axiom") (postulates) and deducing many other [propositions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposition "Proposition") ([theorems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theorem "Theorem")) from these. One of those is the [parallel postulate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_postulate "Parallel postulate") which relates to [parallel lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_lines "Parallel lines") on a [Euclidean plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_plane "Euclidean plane"). Although many of Euclid's results had been stated earlier,[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#cite_note-eves1_19-1) Euclid was the first to organize these propositions into a [logical system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic "Logic") in which each result is _[proved](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical\_proof "Mathematical proof")_ from axioms and previously proved theorems.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#cite_note-2)

The _Elements_ begins with **plane geometry**, still taught in [secondary school](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school "Secondary school") (high school) as the first [axiomatic system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiomatic_system "Axiomatic system") and the first examples of [mathematical proofs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_proof "Mathematical proof"). It goes on to the [solid geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_geometry "Solid geometry") of [three dimensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_dimensions "Three dimensions"). Much of the _Elements_ states results of what are now called [algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra "Algebra") and [number theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory "Number theory"), explained in geometrical language.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#cite_note-eves1_19-1)

For more than two thousand years, the adjective "Euclidean" was unnecessary because Euclid's axioms seemed so intuitively obvious (with the possible exception of the [parallel postulate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_postulate "Parallel postulate")) that theorems proved from them were deemed absolutely true, and thus no other sorts of geometry were possible. Today, however, many other [self-consistent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-consistent "Self-consistent")[non-Euclidean geometries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Euclidean_geometry "Non-Euclidean geometry") are known, the first ones having been discovered in the early 19th century. An implication of [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein")'s theory of [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity") is that physical space itself is not Euclidean, and [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_space "Three-dimensional space") is a good approximation for it only over short distances (relative to the strength of the [gravitational field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity "Gravity")).[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#cite_note-3)

Euclidean geometry is an example of [synthetic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_geometry "Synthetic geometry"), in that it proceeds logically from axioms describing basic properties of geometric objects such as points and lines, to propositions about those objects. This is in contrast to [analytic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_geometry "Analytic geometry"), introduced almost 2,000 years later by [René Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes "René Descartes"), which uses [coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinates "Coordinates") to express geometric properties by means of [algebraic formulas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_formula "Algebraic formula").

The _Elements_ is mainly a systematization of earlier knowledge of geometry. Its improvement over earlier treatments was rapidly recognized, with the result that there was little interest in preserving the earlier ones, and they are now nearly all lost.

There are 13 books in the _Elements_:

Books I–IV and VI discuss plane geometry. Many results about plane figures are proved, for example, "In any triangle, two angles taken together in any manner are less than two right angles." (Book I proposition 17) and the [Pythagorean theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem "Pythagorean theorem") "In right-angled triangles the square on the side subtending the right angle is equal to the squares on the sides containing the right angle." (Book I, proposition 47)

Books V and VII–X deal with [number theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory "Number theory"), with numbers treated geometrically as lengths of line segments or areas of surface regions. Notions such as [prime numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_numbers "Prime numbers") and [rational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_number "Rational number") and [irrational numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrational_number "Irrational number") are introduced. It is proved that there are infinitely many prime numbers.

Books XI–XIII concern [solid geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_geometry "Solid geometry"). A typical result is the 1:3 ratio between the volume of a cone and a cylinder with the same height and base. The [platonic solids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_solid "Platonic solid") are constructed.

[![Image 2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Parallel_postulate_en.svg/250px-Parallel_postulate_en.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Parallel_postulate_en.svg)

The parallel postulate (Postulate 5): If two lines intersect a third in such a way that the sum of the inner angles on one side is less than two right angles, then the two lines inevitably must intersect each other on that side if extended far enough.

Euclidean geometry is an [axiomatic system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiomatic_system "Axiomatic system"), in which all [theorems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theorem "Theorem") ("true statements") are derived from a small number of simple axioms. Until the advent of [non-Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Euclidean_geometry "Non-Euclidean geometry"), these axioms were considered to be obviously true in the physical world, so that all the theorems would be equally true. However, Euclid's reasoning from assumptions to conclusions remains valid independently from the physical reality.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#cite_note-Wolfe-4)

Near the beginning of the first book of the _Elements_, Euclid gives five [postulates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postulate "Postulate") (axioms) for plane geometry, stated in terms of constructions (as translated by Thomas Heath):[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#cite_note-5)

Let the following be postulated:
1.   To draw a [straight line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_line "Straight line") from any [point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(geometry) "Point (geometry)") to any point.
2.   To produce (extend) a [finite straight line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_segment "Line segment") continuously in a straight line.
3.   To describe a [circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle "Circle") with any centre and distance (radius).
4.   That all [right angles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_angle "Right angle") are equal to one another.
5.   [The [parallel postulate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_postulate "Parallel postulate")]: That, if a straight line falling on two straight lines makes the interior angles on the same side less than two right angles, the two straight lines, if produced indefinitely, meet on that side on which the angles are less than two right angles.

Although Euclid explicitly only asserts the existence of the constructed objects, in his reasoning he also implicitly assumes them to be unique.

The _Elements_ also include the following five "common notions":

1.   Things that are equal to the same thing are also equal to one another (the [transitive property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitive_property "Transitive property") of a [Euclidean relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_relation "Euclidean relation")).
2.   If equals are added to equals, then the wholes are equal (Addition property of equality).
3.   If equals are subtracted from equals, then the differences are equal (subtraction property of equality).
4.   Things that coincide with one another are equal to one another (reflexive property).
5.   The whole is greater than the part.

Modern scholars agree that Euclid's postulates do not provide the complete logical foundation that Euclid required for his presentation.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#cite_note-6) Modern [treatments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_geometry "Foundations of geometry") use more extensive and complete sets of axioms.

To the ancients, the parallel postulate seemed less obvious than the others. They aspired to create a system of absolutely certain propositions, and to them, it seemed as if the parallel line postulate required proof from simpler statements. It is now known that such a proof is impossible since one can construct consistent systems of geometry (obeying the other axioms) in which the parallel postulate is true, and others in which it is false.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#cite_note-7) Euclid himself seems to have considered it as being qualitatively different from the others, as evidenced by the organization of the _Elements_: his first 28 propositions are those that can be proved without it.

Many alternative axioms can be formulated which are [logically equivalent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_equivalence "Logical equivalence") to the parallel postulate (in the context of the other axioms). For example, [Playfair's axiom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playfair%27s_axiom "Playfair's axiom") states:

In a [plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(geometry) "Plane (geometry)"), through a point not on a given straight line, at most one line can be drawn that never meets the given line.
The "at most" clause is all that is needed since it can be proved from the remaining axioms that at least one parallel line exists.

[![Image 3](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/Euclid-proof.svg/250px-Euclid-proof.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Euclid-proof.svg)

A proof from Euclid's _Elements_ that, given a line segment, one may construct an equilateral triangle that includes the segment as one of its sides: an equilateral triangle ΑΒΓ is made by drawing circles Δ and Ε centered on the points Α and Β, and taking one intersection of the circles as the third vertex of the triangle.

Euclidean geometry is _[constructive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive\_proof "Constructive proof")_. Postulates 1, 2, 3, and 5 assert the existence and uniqueness of certain geometric figures, and these assertions are of a constructive nature: that is, we are not only told that certain things exist, but are also given methods for creating them with no more than a [compass and an unmarked straightedge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compass_and_straightedge "Compass and straightedge").[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#cite_note-8) In this sense, Euclidean geometry is more concrete than many modern axiomatic systems such as [set theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory "Set theory"), which often assert the existence of objects without saying how to construct them, or even assert the existence of objects that cannot be constructed within the theory.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#cite_note-set_theory-9) Strictly speaking, the lines on paper are _[models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific\_modelling "Scientific modelling")_ of the objects defined within the formal system, rather than instances of those objects. For example, a Euclidean straight line has no width, but any real drawn line will have. Though nearly all modern mathematicians consider [nonconstructive proofs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-constructive_proof "Non-constructive proof") just as sound as constructive ones, they are often considered less [elegant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_beauty "Mathematical beauty"), intuitive, or practically useful. Euclid's constructive proofs often supplanted fallacious nonconstructive ones, e.g. some Pythagorean proofs that assumed all numbers are rational, usually requiring a statement such as "Find the greatest common measure of ..."[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#cite_note-10)

Euclid often used [proof by contradiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_by_contradiction "Proof by contradiction").[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#cite_note-11)

Notation and terminology
------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Euclidean_geometry&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Notation and terminology")]

### Naming of points and figures

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Euclidean_geometry&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Naming of points and figures")]

Points are customarily named using capital letters of the alphabet. Other figures, such as lines, triangles, or circles, are named by listing a sufficient number of points to pick them out unambiguously from the relevant figure, e.g., triangle ABC would typically be a triangle with vertices at points A, B, and C.

### Complementary and supplementary angles

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Euclidean_geometry&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Complementary and supplementary angles")]

Angles whose sum is a right angle are called [complementary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementary_angles "Complementary angles"). Complementary angles are formed when a ray shares the same vertex and is pointed in a direction that is in between the two original rays that form the right angle. The number of rays in between the two original rays is infinite.

Angles whose sum is a straight angle are [supplementary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supplementary_angles "Supplementary angles"). Supplementary angles are formed when a ray shares the same vertex and is pointed in a direction that is in between the two original rays that form the straight angle (180 degree angle). The number of rays in between the two original rays is infinite.

### Modern versions of Euclid's notation

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Euclidean_geometry&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Modern versions of Euclid's notation")]

In modern terminology, angles would normally be measured in [degrees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle) "Degree (angle)") or [radians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radian "Radian").

Modern school textbooks often define separate figures called [lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_(geometry) "Line (geometry)") (infinite), [rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_(mathematics)#Ray "Line (mathematics)") (semi-infinite), and [line segments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_segment "Line segment") (of finite length). Euclid, rather than discussing a ray as an object that extends to infinity in one direction, would normally use locutions such as "if the line is extended to a sufficient length", although he occasionally referred to "infinite lines". A "line" for Euclid could be either straight or curved, and he used the more specific term "straight line" when necessary.

Some important or well known results

The _[Pythagorean theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean\_theorem "Pythagorean theorem")_ states that the sum of the areas of the two squares on the legs (_a_ and _b_) of a right triangle equals the area of the square on the hypotenuse (_c_).

The [pons asinorum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pons_asinorum "Pons asinorum") (_bridge of asses_) states that _in isosceles triangles the angles at the base equal one another, and, if the equal straight lines are produced further, then the angles under the base equal one another_.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#cite_note-12) Its name may be attributed to its frequent role as the first real test in the _Elements_ of the intelligence of the reader and as a bridge to the harder propositions that followed. It might also be so named because of the geometrical figure's resemblance to a steep bridge that only a sure-footed donkey could cross.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#cite_note-13)

### Congruence of triangles

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Euclidean_geometry&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Congruence of triangles")]

[![Image 8](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/Congruent_triangles.svg/250px-Congruent_triangles.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Congruent_triangles.svg)

Congruence of triangles is determined by specifying two sides and the angle between them (SAS), two angles and the side between them (ASA) or two angles and a corresponding adjacent side (AAS). Specifying two sides and an adjacent angle (SSA), however, can yield two distinct possible triangles unless the angle specified is a right angle.

Triangles are congruent if they have all three sides equal (SSS), two sides and the angle between them equal (SAS), or two angles and a side equal (ASA) (Book I, propositions 4, 8, and 26). Triangles with three equal angles (AAA) are similar, but not necessarily congruent. Also, triangles with two equal sides and an adjacent angle are not necessarily equal or congruent.

The sum of the angles of a triangle is equal to a straight angle (180 degrees).[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#cite_note-14) This causes an equilateral triangle to have three interior angles of 60 degrees. Also, it causes every triangle to have at least two acute angles and up to one [obtuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obtuse_angle "Obtuse angle") or [right angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_angle "Right angle").

### Pythagorean theorem

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Euclidean_geometry&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Pythagorean theorem")]

The celebrated [Pythagorean theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem "Pythagorean theorem") (book I, proposition 47) states that in any right triangle, the area of the square whose side is the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares whose sides are the two legs (the two sides that meet at a right angle).

[![Image 9](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Congruentie.svg/250px-Congruentie.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Congruentie.svg)

An example of congruence. The two figures on the left are congruent, while the third is [similar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Similarity_(geometry) "Similarity (geometry)") to them. The last figure is neither. Congruences alter some properties, such as location and orientation, but leave others unchanged, like [distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance "Distance") and [angles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle "Angle"). The latter sort of properties are called [invariants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariant_(mathematics) "Invariant (mathematics)") and studying them is the essence of geometry.

[Thales' theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thales%27_theorem "Thales' theorem"), named after [Thales of Miletus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thales_of_Miletus "Thales of Miletus") states that if A, B, and C are points on a circle where the line AC is a diameter of the circle, then the angle ABC is a right angle. Cantor supposed that Thales proved his theorem by means of Euclid Book I, Prop. 32 after the manner of Euclid Book III, Prop. 31.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#cite_note-15)[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#cite_note-16)

### Scaling of area and volume

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Euclidean_geometry&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Scaling of area and volume")]

In modern terminology, the area of a plane figure is proportional to the square of any of its linear dimensions, ![Image 10: {\displaystyle A\propto L^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1fce05b97628a7f099db68a7decbda56329848e2), and the volume of a solid to the cube, ![Image 11: {\displaystyle V\propto L^{3}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/167f9fddefe70029c097f25fc39660c214247bfd). Euclid proved these results in various special cases such as the area of a circle[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#cite_note-17) and the volume of a parallelepipedal solid.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#cite_note-18) Euclid determined some, but not all, of the relevant constants of proportionality. For instance, it was his successor [Archimedes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes "Archimedes") who proved that a sphere has 2/3 the volume of the circumscribing cylinder.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#cite_note-19)

System of measurement and arithmetic
------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Euclidean_geometry&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: System of measurement and arithmetic")]

Euclidean geometry has two fundamental types of measurements: [angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle "Angle") and [distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance "Euclidean distance"). The angle scale is absolute, and Euclid uses the [right angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_angle "Right angle") as his basic unit, so that, for example, a 45-[degree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle) "Degree (angle)") angle would be referred to as half of a right angle. The distance scale is relative; one arbitrarily picks a line segment with a certain nonzero length as the unit, and other distances are expressed in relation to it. Addition of distances is represented by a construction in which one line segment is copied onto the end of another line segment to extend its length, and similarly for subtraction.

Measurements of [area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_(geometry) "Area (geometry)") and [volume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume "Volume") are derived from distances. For example, a [rectangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectangle "Rectangle") with a width of 3 and a length of 4 has an area that represents the product, 12. Because this geometrical interpretation of multiplication was limited to three dimensions, there was no direct way of interpreting the product of four or more numbers, and Euclid avoided such products, although they are implied, for example in the proof of book IX, proposition 20.

Euclid refers to a pair of lines, or a pair of planar or solid figures, as "equal" (ἴσος) if their lengths, areas, or volumes are equal respectively, and similarly for angles. The stronger term "[congruent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congruence_(geometry) "Congruence (geometry)")" refers to the idea that an entire figure is the same size and shape as another figure. Alternatively, two figures are congruent if one can be moved on top of the other so that it matches up with it exactly. (Flipping it over is allowed.) Thus, for example, a 2x6 rectangle and a 3x4 rectangle are equal but not congruent, and the letter R is congruent to its mirror image. Figures that would be congruent except for their differing sizes are referred to as [similar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Similarity_(geometry) "Similarity (geometry)"). [Corresponding angles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corresponding_sides_and_corresponding_angles "Corresponding sides and corresponding angles") in a pair of similar shapes are equal and [corresponding sides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corresponding_sides "Corresponding sides") are in proportion to each other.

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Euclidean_geometry&action=edit&section=24 "Edit section: Other general applications")]

Because of Euclidean geometry's fundamental status in mathematics, it is impractical to give more than a representative sampling of applications here.

As suggested by the etymology of the word, one of the earliest reasons for interest in and also one of the most common current uses of geometry is [surveying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying "Surveying").[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#cite_note-20) In addition it has been used in [classical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics "Classical mechanics") and the [cognitive and computational approaches to visual perception of objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception#Cognitive_and_computational_approaches "Visual perception"). Certain practical results from Euclidean geometry (such as the right-angle property of the 3-4-5 triangle) were used long before they were proved formally.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#cite_note-21) The fundamental types of measurements in Euclidean geometry are distances and angles, both of which can be measured directly by a surveyor. Historically, distances were often measured by chains, such as [Gunter's chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunter%27s_chain "Gunter's chain"), and angles using graduated circles and, later, the [theodolite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodolite "Theodolite").

An application of Euclidean solid geometry is the [determination of packing arrangements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packing_problem "Packing problem"), such as the problem of finding the most efficient [packing of spheres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere_packing "Sphere packing") in n dimensions.

### Archimedes and Apollonius

A sphere has 2/3 the volume and surface area of its circumscribing cylinder. A sphere and cylinder were placed on the tomb of Archimedes at his request.

[Archimedes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes "Archimedes") (c. 287 BCE– c. 212 BCE), a colorful figure about whom many historical anecdotes are recorded, is remembered along with Euclid as one of the greatest of ancient mathematicians. Although the foundations of his work were put in place by Euclid, his work, unlike Euclid's, is believed to have been entirely original.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#cite_note-23) He proved equations for the volumes and areas of various figures in two and three dimensions, and enunciated the [Archimedean property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedean_property "Archimedean property") of finite numbers.

[Apollonius of Perga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollonius_of_Perga "Apollonius of Perga") (c. 240 BCE– c. 190 BCE) is mainly known for his investigation of conic sections.

### 17th century: Descartes

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Euclidean_geometry&action=edit&section=27 "Edit section: 17th century: Descartes")]

[René Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes "René Descartes") (1596–1650) developed [analytic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_geometry "Analytic geometry"), an alternative method for formalizing geometry which focused on turning geometry into algebra.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#cite_note-24)

In this approach, a point on a plane is represented by its [Cartesian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system "Cartesian coordinate system") (_x_, _y_) coordinates, a line is represented by its equation, and so on.

In Euclid's original approach, the [Pythagorean theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem "Pythagorean theorem") follows from Euclid's axioms. In the Cartesian approach, the axioms are the axioms of algebra, and the equation expressing the Pythagorean theorem is then a definition of one of the terms in Euclid's axioms, which are now considered theorems.

The equation

![Image 32: {\displaystyle |PQ|={\sqrt {(p_{x}-q_{x})^{2}+(p_{y}-q_{y})^{2}}}\,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/583bcd10678b3be4752d1ff41ecb51606ecf895a)
defining the distance between two points _P_ = (_p x_, _p y_) and _Q_ = (_q x_, _q y_) is then known as the _Euclidean [metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric\_space "Metric space")_, and other metrics define [non-Euclidean geometries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Euclidean_geometry "Non-Euclidean geometry").

In terms of analytic geometry, the restriction of classical geometry to compass and straightedge constructions means a restriction to first- and second-order equations, e.g., _y_ = 2 _x_ + 1 (a line), or _x_ 2 + _y_ 2 = 7 (a circle).

Also in the 17th century, [Girard Desargues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girard_Desargues "Girard Desargues"), motivated by the theory of [perspective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(graphical) "Perspective (graphical)"), introduced the concept of idealized points, lines, and planes at infinity. The result can be considered as a type of generalized geometry, [projective geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_geometry "Projective geometry"), but it can also be used to produce proofs in ordinary Euclidean geometry in which the number of special cases is reduced.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#cite_note-25)

[![Image 33](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/Squaring_the_circle.svg/250px-Squaring_the_circle.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Squaring_the_circle.svg)

Squaring the circle: the areas of this square and this circle are equal. In 1882, it was proven that this figure cannot be constructed in a finite number of steps with an idealized [compass and straightedge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compass_and_straightedge "Compass and straightedge").

Geometers of the 18th century struggled to define the boundaries of the Euclidean system. Many tried in vain to prove the fifth postulate from the first four. By 1763, at least 28 different proofs had been published, but all were found incorrect.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#cite_note-26)

Leading up to this period, geometers also tried to determine what constructions could be accomplished in Euclidean geometry. For example, the problem of [trisecting an angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trisecting_an_angle "Trisecting an angle") with a compass and straightedge is one that naturally occurs within the theory, since the axioms refer to constructive operations that can be carried out with those tools. However, centuries of efforts failed to find a solution to this problem, until [Pierre Wantzel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Wantzel "Pierre Wantzel") published a proof in 1837 that such a construction was impossible. Other constructions that were proved impossible include [doubling the cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubling_the_cube "Doubling the cube") and [squaring the circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squaring_the_circle "Squaring the circle"). In the case of doubling the cube, the impossibility of the construction originates from the fact that the compass and straightedge method involve equations whose order is an integral power of two,[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#cite_note-27) while doubling a cube requires the solution of a third-order equation.

[Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler "Leonhard Euler") discussed a generalization of Euclidean geometry called [affine geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_geometry "Affine geometry"), which retains the fifth postulate unmodified while weakening postulates three and four in a way that eliminates the notions of angle (whence right triangles become meaningless) and of equality of length of line segments in general (whence circles become meaningless) while retaining the notions of parallelism as an [equivalence relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_relation "Equivalence relation") between lines, and equality of length of parallel line segments (so line segments continue to have a midpoint).

In the early 19th century, [Carnot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazare_Carnot "Lazare Carnot") and [Möbius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_Ferdinand_M%C3%B6bius "August Ferdinand Möbius") systematically developed the use of signed angles and line segments as a way of simplifying and unifying results.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#cite_note-28)

In the 1840s [William Rowan Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton "William Rowan Hamilton") developed the [quaternions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion "Quaternion"), and [John T. Graves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_T._Graves "John T. Graves") and [Arthur Cayley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Cayley "Arthur Cayley") the [octonions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octonion "Octonion"). These are [normed algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normed_algebra "Normed algebra") which extend the [complex numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_numbers "Complex numbers"). Later it was understood that the quaternions are also a Euclidean geometric system with four real Cartesian coordinates.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#cite_note-FOOTNOTEStillwell200118%E2%80%9321-29) Cayley used quaternions to study [rotations in 4-dimensional Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotations_in_4-dimensional_Euclidean_space "Rotations in 4-dimensional Euclidean space").[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPerez-GraciaThomas2017-30)

At mid-century [Ludwig Schläfli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Schl%C3%A4fli "Ludwig Schläfli") developed the general concept of [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space"), extending Euclidean geometry to [higher dimensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Schl%C3%A4fli#Higher_dimensions "Ludwig Schläfli"). He defined _polyschemes_, later called [polytopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytope "Polytope"), which are the [higher-dimensional analogues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-dimensional_space#Dimensional_analogy "Four-dimensional space") of [polygons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon "Polygon") and [polyhedra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyhedron "Polyhedron"). He developed their theory and discovered all the regular polytopes, i.e. the ![Image 35: {\displaystyle n}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b)-dimensional analogues of regular polygons and [Platonic solids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_solids "Platonic solids"). He found there are six [regular convex polytopes in dimension four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_4-polytopes "Regular 4-polytopes"), and three in all higher dimensions.

Schläfli performed this work in relative obscurity and it was published in full only posthumously in 1901. It had little influence until it was rediscovered and [fully documented in 1948](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_polytopes_(book) "Regular polytopes (book)") by [H.S.M. Coxeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.S.M._Coxeter "H.S.M. Coxeter").

In 1878 [William Kingdon Clifford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Kingdon_Clifford "William Kingdon Clifford") introduced what is now termed [geometric algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_algebra "Geometric algebra"), unifying Hamilton's quaternions with [Hermann Grassmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Grassmann "Hermann Grassmann")'s algebra and revealing the geometric nature of these systems, especially in four dimensions. The operations of geometric algebra have the effect of mirroring, rotating, translating, and mapping the geometric objects that are being modeled to new positions. The [Clifford torus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_torus "Clifford torus") on the surface of the [3-sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-sphere "3-sphere") is the simplest and most symmetric flat embedding of the Cartesian product of two circles (in the same sense that the surface of a cylinder is "flat").

The century's most influential development in geometry occurred when, around 1830, [János Bolyai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%A1nos_Bolyai "János Bolyai") and [Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Ivanovich_Lobachevsky "Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky") separately published work on [non-Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Euclidean_geometry "Non-Euclidean geometry"), in which the parallel postulate is not valid.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#cite_note-31) Since non-Euclidean geometry is provably relatively consistent with Euclidean geometry, the parallel postulate cannot be proved from the other postulates.

In the 19th century, it was also realized that Euclid's ten axioms and common notions do not suffice to prove all of the theorems stated in the _Elements_. For example, Euclid assumed implicitly that any line contains at least two points, but this assumption cannot be proved from the other axioms, and therefore must be an axiom itself. The very first geometric proof in the _Elements,_ shown in the figure above, is that any line segment is part of a triangle; Euclid constructs this in the usual way, by drawing circles around both endpoints and taking their intersection as the third [vertex](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/vertex "wikt:vertex"). His axioms, however, do not guarantee that the circles actually intersect, because they do not assert the geometrical property of continuity, which in Cartesian terms is equivalent to the [completeness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number#Completeness "Real number") property of the real numbers. Starting with [Moritz Pasch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moritz_Pasch "Moritz Pasch") in 1882, many improved axiomatic systems for geometry have been proposed, the best known being those of [Hilbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_axioms "Hilbert's axioms"),[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#cite_note-32)[George Birkhoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birkhoff%27s_axioms "Birkhoff's axioms"),[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#cite_note-33) and [Tarski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarski%27s_axioms "Tarski's axioms").[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#cite_note-Tarski_1951-34)

### 20th century and relativity

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Euclidean_geometry&action=edit&section=32 "Edit section: 20th century and relativity")]

[![Image 36](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/1919_eclipse_negative.jpg/250px-1919_eclipse_negative.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:1919_eclipse_negative.jpg)

A disproof of Euclidean geometry as a description of physical space. In a 1919 test of the general theory of relativity, stars (marked with short horizontal lines) were photographed during a solar [eclipse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse "Eclipse"). The rays of starlight were bent by the Sun's gravity on their way to Earth. This is interpreted as evidence in favor of Einstein's prediction that gravity would cause deviations from Euclidean geometry.

[Einstein's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein") theory of [special relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity "Special relativity") involves a four-dimensional [space-time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-time "Space-time"), the [Minkowski space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_space "Minkowski space"), which is [non-Euclidean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Euclidean_geometry "Non-Euclidean geometry"). This shows that non-Euclidean geometries, which had been introduced a few years earlier for showing that the [parallel postulate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_postulate "Parallel postulate") cannot be proved, are also useful for describing the physical world.

However, the three-dimensional "space part" of the Minkowski space remains the space of Euclidean geometry. This is not the case with [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity"), for which the geometry of the space part of space-time is not Euclidean geometry.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#cite_note-35) For example, if a triangle is constructed out of three rays of light, then in general the interior angles do not add up to 180 degrees due to gravity. A relatively weak gravitational field, such as the Earth's or the Sun's, is represented by a metric that is approximately, but not exactly, Euclidean. Until the 20th century, there was no technology capable of detecting these deviations in rays of light from Euclidean geometry, but Einstein predicted that such deviations would exist. They were later verified by observations such as the slight bending of starlight by the Sun during a solar eclipse in 1919, and such considerations are now an integral part of the software that runs the [GPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System "Global Positioning System") system.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#cite_note-36)

As a description of the structure of space
------------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Euclidean_geometry&action=edit&section=33 "Edit section: As a description of the structure of space")]

Euclid believed that his [axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axioms "Axioms") were self-evident statements about physical reality. Euclid's proofs depend upon assumptions perhaps not obvious in Euclid's fundamental axioms,[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#cite_note-Trudeau-37) in particular that certain movements of figures do not change their geometrical properties such as the lengths of sides and interior angles, the so-called _Euclidean motions_, which include translations, reflections and rotations of figures.[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#cite_note-Euclidean_Motion-38) Taken as a physical description of space, postulate 2 (extending a line) asserts that space does not have holes or boundaries; postulate 4 (equality of right angles) says that space is [isotropic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotropic "Isotropic") and figures may be moved to any location while maintaining [congruence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congruence_(geometry) "Congruence (geometry)"); and postulate 5 (the [parallel postulate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_postulate "Parallel postulate")) that space is flat (has no [intrinsic curvature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrinsic_curvature "Intrinsic curvature")).[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#cite_note-Penrose-39)

As discussed above, [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein")'s [theory of relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_relativity "Theory of relativity") significantly modifies this view.

The ambiguous character of the axioms as originally formulated by Euclid makes it possible for different commentators to disagree about some of their other implications for the structure of space, such as whether or not it is infinite[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#cite_note-Heath,_p._200-40) (see below) and what its [topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology "Topology") is. Modern, more rigorous reformulations of the system[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#cite_note-41) typically aim for a cleaner separation of these issues. Interpreting Euclid's axioms in the spirit of this more modern approach, axioms 1–4 are consistent with either infinite or finite space (as in [elliptic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_geometry "Elliptic geometry")), and all five axioms are consistent with a variety of topologies (e.g., a plane, a cylinder, or a [torus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torus "Torus") for two-dimensional Euclidean geometry).

Treatment of infinity
---------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Euclidean_geometry&action=edit&section=34 "Edit section: Treatment of infinity")]

Euclid sometimes distinguished explicitly between "finite lines" (e.g., Postulate 2) and "[infinite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity "Infinity") lines" (book I, proposition 12). However, he typically did not make such distinctions unless they were necessary. The postulates do not explicitly refer to infinite lines, although for example some commentators interpret postulate 3, existence of a circle with any radius, as implying that space is infinite.[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#cite_note-Heath,_p._200-40)

The notion of [infinitesimal quantities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinitesimals "Infinitesimals") had previously been discussed extensively by the [Eleatic School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleatic_School "Eleatic School"), but nobody had been able to put them on a firm logical basis, with paradoxes such as [Zeno's paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno%27s_paradox "Zeno's paradox") occurring that had not been resolved to universal satisfaction. Euclid used the [method of exhaustion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_exhaustion "Method of exhaustion") rather than infinitesimals.[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#cite_note-42)

Later ancient commentators, such as [Proclus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proclus "Proclus") (410–485 CE), treated many questions about infinity as issues demanding proof and, e.g., Proclus claimed to prove the infinite divisibility of a line, based on a proof by contradiction in which he considered the cases of even and odd numbers of points constituting it.[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#cite_note-43)

At the turn of the 20th century, [Otto Stolz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Stolz "Otto Stolz"), [Paul du Bois-Reymond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_du_Bois-Reymond "Paul du Bois-Reymond"), [Giuseppe Veronese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Veronese "Giuseppe Veronese"), and others produced controversial work on [non-Archimedean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedean_property "Archimedean property") models of Euclidean geometry, in which the distance between two points may be infinite or infinitesimal, in the [Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton")–[Leibniz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Leibniz "Gottfried Leibniz") sense.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#cite_note-44) Fifty years later, [Abraham Robinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Robinson "Abraham Robinson") provided a rigorous logical foundation for Veronese's work.[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#cite_note-45)

Ancient geometers may have considered the parallel postulate – that two parallel lines do not ever intersect – less certain than the others because it makes a statement about infinitely remote regions of space, and so cannot be physically verified.[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#cite_note-46)

The modern formulation of [proof by induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_by_induction "Proof by induction") was not developed until the 17th century, but some later commentators consider it implicit in some of Euclid's proofs, e.g., the proof of the infinitude of primes.[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#cite_note-47)

Supposed paradoxes involving infinite series, such as [Zeno's paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno%27s_paradox "Zeno's paradox"), predated Euclid. Euclid avoided such discussions, giving, for example, the expression for the partial sums of the [geometric series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_series "Geometric series") in IX.35 without commenting on the possibility of letting the number of terms become infinite.

[![Image 37: [icon]](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg)This section **needs expansion**. You can help by [adding to it](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Euclidean_geometry&action=edit&section=). _(June 2010)_

Euclid frequently used the method of [proof by contradiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_by_contradiction "Proof by contradiction"), and therefore the traditional presentation of Euclidean geometry assumes [classical logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_logic "Classical logic"), in which every proposition is either true or false, i.e., for any proposition P, the proposition "P or not P" is automatically true.[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#cite_note-48) The proof by contradiction (or [reductio ad absurdum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_absurdum "Reductio ad absurdum") method) rests on two cardinal principles of classical logic: the [law of contradiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_contradiction "Law of contradiction") and the [law of the excluded middle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_excluded_middle "Law of the excluded middle"). In simple terms, the law of contradiction says _that if S is any statement, then S and a contradiction_ (that is, the denial) _of S cannot both hold_. And the law of the excluded middle states, that _either S or the denial of S must hold_ (that is, there is no third, or middle, possibility). This method therefore consists of assuming (by way of hypothesis) that a proposition that is to be established is false; if an absurdity follows, one concludes that the hypothesis is untenable and that the original proposition must then be true.[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#cite_note-49)

### Modern standards of rigor

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Euclidean_geometry&action=edit&section=39 "Edit section: Modern standards of rigor")]

Placing Euclidean geometry on a solid axiomatic basis was a preoccupation of mathematicians for centuries.[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#cite_note-Smith-50) The role of [primitive notions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_notion "Primitive notion"), or undefined concepts, was clearly put forward by [Alessandro Padoa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alessandro_Padoa "Alessandro Padoa") of the [Peano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Peano "Giuseppe Peano") delegation at the 1900 Paris conference:[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#cite_note-Smith-50)[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#cite_note-revue-51)

> ...when we begin to formulate the theory, we can imagine that the undefined symbols are _completely devoid of meaning_ and that the unproved propositions are simply _conditions_ imposed upon the undefined symbols.
> 
> 
> Then, the _system of ideas_ that we have initially chosen is simply _one interpretation_ of the undefined symbols; but..this interpretation can be ignored by the reader, who is free to replace it in his mind by _another interpretation_.. that satisfies the conditions...
> 
> 
> _Logical_ questions thus become completely independent of _empirical_ or _psychological_ questions...
> 
> 
> The system of undefined symbols can then be regarded as the _abstraction_ obtained from the _specialized theories_ that result when...the system of undefined symbols is successively replaced by each of the interpretations...

— Padoa, _Essai d'une théorie algébrique des nombre entiers, avec une Introduction logique à une théorie déductive quelconque_

That is, mathematics is context-independent knowledge within a hierarchical framework. As said by [Bertrand Russell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell "Bertrand Russell"):[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#cite_note-Newman-52)

> If our hypothesis is about _anything_, and not about some one or more particular things, then our deductions constitute mathematics. Thus, mathematics may be defined as the subject in which we never know what we are talking about, nor whether what we are saying is true.

— Bertrand Russell, _Mathematics and the metaphysicians_

### Axiomatic formulations

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Euclidean_geometry&action=edit&section=40 "Edit section: Axiomatic formulations")]

> Geometry is the science of correct reasoning on incorrect figures.

*   Euclid's axioms: In his dissertation to Trinity College, Cambridge, Bertrand Russell summarized the changing role of Euclid's geometry in the minds of philosophers up to that time.[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#cite_note-Russell-53) It was a conflict between certain knowledge, independent of experiment, and empiricism, requiring experimental input. This issue became clear as it was discovered that the [parallel postulate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_postulate "Parallel postulate") was not necessarily valid and its applicability was an empirical matter, deciding whether the applicable geometry was Euclidean or [non-Euclidean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Euclidean_geometry "Non-Euclidean geometry").
*   [Hilbert's axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_axioms "Hilbert's axioms"): Hilbert's axioms had the goal of identifying a _simple_ and _complete_ set of _independent_ axioms from which the most important geometric theorems could be deduced. The outstanding objectives were to make Euclidean geometry rigorous (avoiding hidden assumptions) and to make clear the ramifications of the parallel postulate.
*   [Birkhoff's axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birkhoff%27s_axioms "Birkhoff's axioms"): Birkhoff proposed four postulates for Euclidean geometry that can be confirmed experimentally with scale and protractor. This system relies heavily on the properties of the [real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_numbers "Real numbers").[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#cite_note-Brikhoff-54)[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#cite_note-Smith2-55)[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#cite_note-Moise-56) The notions of _angle_ and _distance_ become primitive concepts.[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#cite_note-Silvester-57)
*   [Tarski's axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarski%27s_axioms "Tarski's axioms"): [Alfred Tarski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Tarski "Alfred Tarski") (1902–1983) and his students defined _elementary_ Euclidean geometry as the geometry that can be expressed in [first-order logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_logic "First-order logic") and does not depend on [set theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory "Set theory") for its logical basis,[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#cite_note-Tarski0-58) in contrast to Hilbert's axioms, which involve point sets.[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#cite_note-Simmons-59) Tarski proved that his axiomatic formulation of elementary Euclidean geometry is consistent and complete in a certain [sense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decidability_(logic) "Decidability (logic)"): there is an algorithm that, for every proposition, can be shown either true or false.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#cite_note-Tarski_1951-34) (This does not violate [Gödel's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems "Gödel's incompleteness theorems"), because Euclidean geometry cannot describe a sufficient amount of [arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_arithmetic "Peano arithmetic") for the theorem to apply.[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#cite_note-60)) This is equivalent to the decidability of [real closed fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_closed_fields "Real closed fields"), of which elementary Euclidean geometry is a model.

It is that, the figure of the proposition being like that of a trestle bridge, with a ramp at each end which is more practicable the flatter the figure is drawn, the bridge is such that, while a horse could not surmount the ramp, an ass could; in other words, the term is meant to refer to the sure-footedness of the ass rather than to any want of intelligence on his part."

[Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton "William Rowan Hamilton") did not see them as such when he [discovered the quaternions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quaternions "History of quaternions"). [Schläfli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Schl%C3%A4fli "Ludwig Schläfli") would be the first to consider [four-dimensional Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4-dimensional_space "4-dimensional space"), publishing his discovery of the regular [polyschemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyscheme "Polyscheme") in 1852, but Hamilton would never be influenced by that work, which remained obscure into the 20th century. Hamilton found the quaternions when he realized that a fourth dimension, in some sense, would be necessary in order to model rotations in three-dimensional space. Although he described a quaternion as an _ordered four-element multiple of real numbers_, the quaternions were for him an extension of the complex numbers, not a Euclidean space of four dimensions.
