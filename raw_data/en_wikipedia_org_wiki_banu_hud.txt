The Hudid dynasty descends from Hud ibn Abd Allah ibn Musa ibn Salem al-Judhami (d. ca. 960).

In 1039, under the leadership of Al-Mustain I, Sulayman ibn Hud al-Judhami , the Bani Hud seized control of Zaragoza from a rival clan, the Banu Tujib . His heirs, particularly Ahmad I al-Muqtadir (1046–1081), Yusuf al-Mutamin (1081–1085), and Al-Mustain II, Ahmad ibn Yusuf (1085–1110), were patrons of culture and the arts. The Aljafería , the royal residence erected by Ahmad I, is practically the only palace from that period to have survived almost in its entirety.

[ 3 ] Despite their independence, the Banu Hud were forced to recognize the superiority of the kingdom of Castile and pay parias to it as early as 1055.

[ 4 ] In 1086, they led the smaller kingdoms in their resistance to the Almoravids , who did not succeed in conquering Zaragoza until May 1110. The conquest represented the end of the dynasty. The last of the Banu Hud, Imad al-Dawl Abd al-Malik (Abdelmalik) Al Hud, the last king of Zaragoza, forced to abandon his capital, allied himself with the Christian kingdom of Aragon under Alfonso the Battler , [ 5 ] who in 1118 reconquered the city for the Christians and made it the capital of Aragon.

[ 6 ] The last king's son, Zafadola ( Sayf al-Dawla ), had some territorial authority before being killed by Christians during a battle.

[ 1 ] Between 1228 and 1237, most of al-Andalus was controlled by Ibn Hud , who claimed descent from the Banu Hud.

^ The rock crystal " Eleanor vase " given by Eleanor of Aquitaine to the Basilica of Saint Denis and elaborately mounted by Abbot Suger , is conserved in the Louvre . The mounts are inscribed with the vase's provenance. It owner Mitadolus was not identified as Imad al-Dawl until 1993 (George T. Beech, "The Eleanor of Aquitaine Vase, William IX of Aquitaine, and Muslim Spain" Gesta 32 .1 (1993), pp. 3-10). It appears to have been a gift to William IX of Aquitaine about this time, in hopes of securing his support.
