Find sources: "Solution set" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( January 2011 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) In mathematics , the solution set of a system of equations or inequality is the set of all its solutions, that is the values that satisfy all equations and inequalities.

[ 1 ] Also, the solution set or the truth set of a statement or a predicate is the set of all values that satisfy it.

If there is no solution, the solution set is the empty set .

[ 2 ] Examples [ edit ] The solution set of the single equation x = 0 {\displaystyle x=0} is the singleton set { 0 } {\displaystyle \{0\}} .

Since there do not exist numbers x {\displaystyle x} and y {\displaystyle y} making the two equations { x + 2 y = 3 , x + 2 y = − − 3 {\displaystyle {\begin{cases}x+2y=3,&\\x+2y=-3\end{cases}}} simultaneously true, the solution set of this system is the empty set ∅ ∅ {\displaystyle \emptyset } .

The solution set of a constrained optimization problem is its feasible region .

The truth set of the predicate P ( n ) : n i s e v e n {\displaystyle P(n):n\mathrm {\ is\ even} } is { 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , … … } {\displaystyle \{2,4,6,8,\ldots \}} .

Remarks [ edit ] In algebraic geometry , solution sets are called algebraic sets if there are no inequalities. Over the reals , and with inequalities, there are called semialgebraic sets .

Other meanings [ edit ] More generally, the solution set to an arbitrary collection E of relations ( E i ) ( i varying in some index set I ) for a collection of unknowns ( x j ) j ∈ ∈ J {\displaystyle {(x_{j})}_{j\in J}} , supposed to take values in respective spaces ( X j ) j ∈ ∈ J {\displaystyle {(X_{j})}_{j\in J}} , is the set S of all solutions to the relations E , where a solution x ( k ) {\displaystyle x^{(k)}} is a family of values ( x j ( k ) ) j ∈ ∈ J ∈ ∈ ∏ ∏ j ∈ ∈ J X j {\textstyle {\left(x_{j}^{(k)}\right)}_{j\in J}\in \prod _{j\in J}X_{j}} such that substituting ( x j ) j ∈ ∈ J {\displaystyle {\left(x_{j}\right)}_{j\in J}} by x ( k ) {\displaystyle x^{(k)}} in the collection E makes all relations "true".

(Instead of relations depending on unknowns, one should speak more correctly of predicates , the collection E is their logical conjunction , and the solution set is the inverse image of the boolean value true by the associated boolean-valued function .) The above meaning is a special case of this one, if the set of polynomials f i if interpreted as the set of equations f i ( x )=0.

Examples [ edit ] The solution set for E = { x + y = 0 } with respect to ( x , y ) ∈ ∈ R 2 {\displaystyle (x,y)\in \mathbb {R} ^{2}} is S = { ( a ,− a ) : a ∈ R }.

The solution set for E = { x + y = 0 } with respect to x ∈ ∈ R {\displaystyle x\in \mathbb {R} } is S = { − y }. (Here, y is not "declared" as an unknown, and thus to be seen as a parameter on which the equation, and therefore the solution set, depends.) The solution set for E = { x ≤ ≤ 4 } {\displaystyle E=\{{\sqrt {x}}\leq 4\}} with respect to x ∈ ∈ R {\displaystyle x\in \mathbb {R} } is the interval S = [0,2] (since x {\displaystyle {\sqrt {x}}} is undefined for negative values of x ).

The solution set for E = { e i x = 1 } {\displaystyle E=\{e^{ix}=1\}} with respect to x ∈ ∈ C {\displaystyle x\in \mathbb {C} } is S = 2π Z (see Euler's identity ).
