{\displaystyle L_{p}(\mathbf {x} )={\frac {\sum _{k=1}^{n}x_{k}^{p}}{\sum _{k=1}^{n}x_{k}^{p-1}}}.} The weighted Lehmer mean with respect to a tuple w {\displaystyle w} of positive weights is defined as: L p , w ( x ) = ∑ ∑ k = 1 n w k ⋅ ⋅ x k p ∑ ∑ k = 1 n w k ⋅ ⋅ x k p − − 1 .

{\displaystyle L_{p,w}(\mathbf {x} )={\frac {\sum _{k=1}^{n}w_{k}\cdot x_{k}^{p}}{\sum _{k=1}^{n}w_{k}\cdot x_{k}^{p-1}}}.} The Lehmer mean is an alternative to power means for interpolating between minimum and maximum via arithmetic mean and harmonic mean .

Properties [ edit ] The derivative of p ↦ ↦ L p ( x ) {\displaystyle p\mapsto L_{p}(\mathbf {x} )} is non-negative ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ p L p ( x ) = ( ∑ ∑ j = 1 n ∑ ∑ k = j + 1 n [ x j − − x k ] ⋅ ⋅ [ ln ⁡ ⁡ ( x j ) − − ln ⁡ ⁡ ( x k ) ] ⋅ ⋅ [ x j ⋅ ⋅ x k ] p − − 1 ) ( ∑ ∑ k = 1 n x k p − − 1 ) 2 , {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial }{\partial p}}L_{p}(\mathbf {x} )={\frac {\left(\sum _{j=1}^{n}\sum _{k=j+1}^{n}\left[x_{j}-x_{k}\right]\cdot \left[\ln(x_{j})-\ln(x_{k})\right]\cdot \left[x_{j}\cdot x_{k}\right]^{p-1}\right)}{\left(\sum _{k=1}^{n}x_{k}^{p-1}\right)^{2}}},} thus this function is monotonic and the inequality p ≤ ≤ q ⟹ ⟹ L p ( x ) ≤ ≤ L q ( x ) {\displaystyle p\leq q\Longrightarrow L_{p}(\mathbf {x} )\leq L_{q}(\mathbf {x} )} holds.

The derivative of the weighted Lehmer mean is: ∂ ∂ L p , w ( x ) ∂ ∂ p = ( ∑ ∑ w x p − − 1 ) ( ∑ ∑ w x p ln ⁡ ⁡ x ) − − ( ∑ ∑ w x p ) ( ∑ ∑ w x p − − 1 ln ⁡ ⁡ x ) ( ∑ ∑ w x p − − 1 ) 2 {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial L_{p,w}(\mathbf {x} )}{\partial p}}={\frac {(\sum wx^{p-1})(\sum wx^{p}\ln {x})-(\sum wx^{p})(\sum wx^{p-1}\ln {x})}{(\sum wx^{p-1})^{2}}}} Special cases [ edit ] lim p → → − − ∞ ∞ L p ( x ) {\displaystyle \lim _{p\to -\infty }L_{p}(\mathbf {x} )} is the minimum of the elements of x {\displaystyle \mathbf {x} } .

L 0 ( x ) {\displaystyle L_{0}(\mathbf {x} )} is the harmonic mean .

L 1 2 ( ( x 1 , x 2 ) ) {\displaystyle L_{\frac {1}{2}}\left((x_{1},x_{2})\right)} is the geometric mean of the two values x 1 {\displaystyle x_{1}} and x 2 {\displaystyle x_{2}} .

L 1 ( x ) {\displaystyle L_{1}(\mathbf {x} )} is the arithmetic mean .

L 2 ( x ) {\displaystyle L_{2}(\mathbf {x} )} is the contraharmonic mean .

lim p → → ∞ ∞ L p ( x ) {\displaystyle \lim _{p\to \infty }L_{p}(\mathbf {x} )} is the maximum of the elements of x {\displaystyle \mathbf {x} } .

Sketch of a proof: Without loss of generality let x 1 , … … , x k {\displaystyle x_{1},\dots ,x_{k}} be the values which equal the maximum. Then L p ( x ) = x 1 ⋅ ⋅ k + ( x k + 1 x 1 ) p + ⋯ ⋯ + ( x n x 1 ) p k + ( x k + 1 x 1 ) p − − 1 + ⋯ ⋯ + ( x n x 1 ) p − − 1 {\displaystyle L_{p}(\mathbf {x} )=x_{1}\cdot {\frac {k+\left({\frac {x_{k+1}}{x_{1}}}\right)^{p}+\cdots +\left({\frac {x_{n}}{x_{1}}}\right)^{p}}{k+\left({\frac {x_{k+1}}{x_{1}}}\right)^{p-1}+\cdots +\left({\frac {x_{n}}{x_{1}}}\right)^{p-1}}}} Applications [ edit ] Signal processing [ edit ] Like a power mean , a Lehmer mean serves a non-linear moving average which is shifted towards small signal values for small p {\displaystyle p} and emphasizes big signal values for big p {\displaystyle p} . Given an efficient implementation of a moving arithmetic mean called smooth you can implement a moving Lehmer mean according to the following Haskell code.

lehmerSmooth :: Floating a => ([ a ] -> [ a ]) -> a -> [ a ] -> [ a ] lehmerSmooth smooth p xs = zipWith ( / ) ( smooth ( map ( ** p ) xs )) ( smooth ( map ( ** ( p - 1 )) xs )) For big p {\displaystyle p} it can serve an envelope detector on a rectified signal.

For small p {\displaystyle p} it can serve an baseline detector on a mass spectrum .

Gonzalez and Woods call this a "contraharmonic mean filter " described for varying values of p (however, as above, the contraharmonic mean can refer to the specific case p = 2 {\displaystyle p=2} ). Their convention is to substitute p with the order of the filter Q : f ( x ) = ∑ ∑ k = 1 n x k Q + 1 ∑ ∑ k = 1 n x k Q .

{\displaystyle f(x)={\frac {\sum _{k=1}^{n}x_{k}^{Q+1}}{\sum _{k=1}^{n}x_{k}^{Q}}}.} Q =0 is the arithmetic mean. Positive Q can reduce pepper noise and negative Q can reduce salt noise .
