In Euclidean plane geometry , Lester's theorem states that in any scalene triangle , the two Fermat points , the nine-point center , and the circumcenter lie on the same circle .
The result is named after June Lester, who published it in 1997, [ 1 ] and the circle through these points was called the Lester circle by Clark Kimberling .

[ 2 ] Lester proved the result by using the properties of complex numbers ; subsequent authors have given elementary proofs [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] , proofs using vector arithmetic, [ 7 ] and computerized proofs.

[ 8 ] The center of the Lester circle is also a triangle center. It is the center designated as X(1116) in the Encyclopedia of Triangle Centers .

[ 9 ] Recently, Peter Moses discovered 21 other triangle centers lie on the Lester circle . The points are numbered X(15535) – X(15555) in the Encyclopedia of Triangle Centers .

[ 10 ] Gibert's generalization [ edit ] In 2000, Bernard Gibert proposed a generalization of the Lester Theorem involving the Kiepert hyperbola of a triangle. His result can be stated as follows: Every circle with a diameter that is a chord of the Kiepert hyperbola and perpendicular to the triangle's Euler line passes through the Fermat points .

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] Dao's generalizations [ edit ] Dao's first generalization [ edit ] In 2014, Dao Thanh Oai extended Gibert's result to every rectangular hyperbola . The generalization is as follows: Let H {\displaystyle H} and G {\displaystyle G} lie on one branch of a rectangular hyperbola, and let F + {\displaystyle F_{+}} and F − − {\displaystyle F_{-}} be the two points on the hyperbola that are symmetrical about its center ( antipodal points ), where the tangents at these points are parallel to the line H G {\displaystyle HG} . Let K + {\displaystyle K_{+}} and K − − {\displaystyle K_{-}} be two points on the hyperbola where the tangents intersect at a point E {\displaystyle E} on the line H G {\displaystyle HG} . If the line K + K − − {\displaystyle K_{+}K_{-}} intersects H G {\displaystyle HG} at D {\displaystyle D} , and the perpendicular bisector of D E {\displaystyle DE} intersects the hyperbola at G + {\displaystyle G_{+}} and G − − {\displaystyle G_{-}} , then the six points F + {\displaystyle F_{+}} , F − − , {\displaystyle F_{-},} E , {\displaystyle E,} F , {\displaystyle F,} G + {\displaystyle G_{+}} , and G − − {\displaystyle G_{-}} lie on a circle. When the rectangular hyperbola is the Kiepert hyperbola and F + {\displaystyle F_{+}} and F − − {\displaystyle F_{-}} are the two Fermat points , Dao's generalization becomes Gibert's generalization.

[ 12 ] [ 13 ] Dao's second generalization [ edit ] In 2015, Dao Thanh Oai proposed another generalization of the Lester circle, this time associated with the Neuberg cubic . It can be stated as follows: Let P {\displaystyle P} be a point on the Neuberg cubic , and let P A {\displaystyle P_{A}} be the reflection of P {\displaystyle P} in the line B C {\displaystyle BC} , with P B {\displaystyle P_{B}} and P C {\displaystyle P_{C}} defined cyclically. The lines A P A {\displaystyle AP_{A}} , B P B {\displaystyle BP_{B}} , and C P C {\displaystyle CP_{C}} are known to be concurrent at a point denoted as Q ( P ) {\displaystyle Q(P)} . The four points X 13 {\displaystyle X_{13}} , X 14 {\displaystyle X_{14}} , P {\displaystyle P} , and Q ( P ) {\displaystyle Q(P)} lie on a circle. When P {\displaystyle P} is the point X ( 3 ) {\displaystyle X(3)} , it is known that Q ( P ) = Q ( X 3 ) = X 5 {\displaystyle Q(P)=Q(X_{3})=X_{5}} , making Dao's generalization a restatement of the Lester Theorem.
