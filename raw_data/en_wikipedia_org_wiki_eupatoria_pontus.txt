Eupatoria was the crossing-point of two great roads through the Pontus: the east-west from Armenia Minor to Bithynia ; and the north-south from Amisus to Caesarea Mazaca . The east-west road followed the valley of the Lycus from Armenia Minor to Phanaroea; it continued over the mountains into the Destek to Laodicea Pontica (modern Ladik), the Halys (Kızılırmak) and the Amnias (Gökırmak) through Paphlagonia to Bithynia ; the north-south road went from Amisus (modern Samsun) up the Iris to Amaseia (Amasya), Zela (Zile), up to the Anatolian Plateau and Caesarea Mazaca (Kayseri).

[ 3 ] History [ edit ] Kingdom of Pontus [ edit ] The city was founded by Mithridates VI Eupator (r. 120-63 BCE) just south of where the Lycus flows into the Iris , the west end of the fertile valley of Phanaroea , probably in or near the village of Çevresu, Erbaa district, Tokat Province .

[ 4 ] It was called Eupatoria .

[ 5 ] Roman period [ edit ] It was completed by Pompey , who renamed it to Magnopolis [ 5 ] and extended its territory to include the western Phanaroean plain.

Appian refers to the city by both names, Eupatoria and Magnopolis, while Strabo , in one instance, calls it Megalopolis.
