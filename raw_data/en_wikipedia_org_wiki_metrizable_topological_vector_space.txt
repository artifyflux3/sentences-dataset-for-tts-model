pseudometrizable ) topological vector space (TVS) is a TVS whose topology is induced by a metric (resp.

pseudometric ). An LM-space is an inductive limit of a sequence of locally convex metrizable TVS.

Pseudometrics and metrics [ edit ] A pseudometric on a set X {\displaystyle X} is a map d : X × × X → → R {\displaystyle d:X\times X\rightarrow \mathbb {R} } satisfying the following properties: d ( x , x ) = 0 for all x ∈ ∈ X {\displaystyle d(x,x)=0{\text{ for all }}x\in X} ; Symmetry : d ( x , y ) = d ( y , x ) for all x , y ∈ ∈ X {\displaystyle d(x,y)=d(y,x){\text{ for all }}x,y\in X} ; Subadditivity : d ( x , z ) ≤ ≤ d ( x , y ) + d ( y , z ) for all x , y , z ∈ ∈ X .

{\displaystyle d(x,z)\leq d(x,y)+d(y,z){\text{ for all }}x,y,z\in X.} A pseudometric is called a metric if it satisfies: Identity of indiscernibles : for all x , y ∈ ∈ X , {\displaystyle x,y\in X,} if d ( x , y ) = 0 {\displaystyle d(x,y)=0} then x = y .

{\displaystyle x=y.} Ultrapseudometric A pseudometric d {\displaystyle d} on X {\displaystyle X} is called a ultrapseudometric or a strong pseudometric if it satisfies: Strong / Ultrametric triangle inequality : d ( x , z ) ≤ ≤ max { d ( x , y ) , d ( y , z ) } for all x , y , z ∈ ∈ X .

{\displaystyle d(x,z)\leq \max\{d(x,y),d(y,z)\}{\text{ for all }}x,y,z\in X.} Pseudometric space A pseudometric space is a pair ( X , d ) {\displaystyle (X,d)} consisting of a set X {\displaystyle X} and a pseudometric d {\displaystyle d} on X {\displaystyle X} such that X {\displaystyle X} 's topology is identical to the topology on X {\displaystyle X} induced by d .

{\displaystyle d.} We call a pseudometric space ( X , d ) {\displaystyle (X,d)} a metric space (resp.

ultrapseudometric space ) when d {\displaystyle d} is a metric (resp. ultrapseudometric).

Topology induced by a pseudometric [ edit ] If d {\displaystyle d} is a pseudometric on a set X {\displaystyle X} then collection of open balls : B r ( z ) := { x ∈ ∈ X : d ( x , z ) < r } {\displaystyle B_{r}(z):=\{x\in X:d(x,z)<r\}} as z {\displaystyle z} ranges over X {\displaystyle X} and r > 0 {\displaystyle r>0} ranges over the positive real numbers,
forms a basis for a topology on X {\displaystyle X} that is called the d {\displaystyle d} -topology or the pseudometric topology on X {\displaystyle X} induced by d .

{\displaystyle d.} Convention : If ( X , d ) {\displaystyle (X,d)} is a pseudometric space and X {\displaystyle X} is treated as a topological space , then unless indicated otherwise, it should be assumed that X {\displaystyle X} is endowed with the topology induced by d .

{\displaystyle d.} Pseudometrizable space A topological space ( X , τ τ ) {\displaystyle (X,\tau )} is called pseudometrizable (resp.

metrizable , ultrapseudometrizable ) if there exists a pseudometric (resp. metric, ultrapseudometric) d {\displaystyle d} on X {\displaystyle X} such that τ τ {\displaystyle \tau } is equal to the topology induced by d .

{\displaystyle d.} [ 1 ] Pseudometrics and values on topological groups [ edit ] An additive topological group is an additive group endowed with a topology, called a group topology , under which addition and negation become continuous operators.

A topology τ τ {\displaystyle \tau } on a real or complex vector space X {\displaystyle X} is called a vector topology or a TVS topology if it makes the operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication continuous (that is, if it makes X {\displaystyle X} into a topological vector space ).

Every topological vector space (TVS) X {\displaystyle X} is an additive commutative topological group but not all group topologies on X {\displaystyle X} are vector topologies. 
This is because despite it making addition and negation continuous, a group topology on a vector space X {\displaystyle X} may fail to make scalar multiplication continuous. 
For instance, the discrete topology on any non-trivial vector space makes addition and negation continuous but do not make scalar multiplication continuous.

Translation invariant pseudometrics [ edit ] If X {\displaystyle X} is an additive group then we say that a pseudometric d {\displaystyle d} on X {\displaystyle X} is translation invariant or just invariant if it satisfies any of the following equivalent conditions: Translation invariance : d ( x + z , y + z ) = d ( x , y ) for all x , y , z ∈ ∈ X {\displaystyle d(x+z,y+z)=d(x,y){\text{ for all }}x,y,z\in X} ; d ( x , y ) = d ( x − − y , 0 ) for all x , y ∈ ∈ X .

{\displaystyle d(x,y)=d(x-y,0){\text{ for all }}x,y\in X.} Value/G-seminorm [ edit ] If X {\displaystyle X} is a topological group the a value or G-seminorm on X {\displaystyle X} (the G stands for Group) is a real-valued map p : X → → R {\displaystyle p:X\rightarrow \mathbb {R} } with the following properties: [ 2 ] Non-negative : p ≥ ≥ 0.

{\displaystyle p\geq 0.} Subadditive : p ( x + y ) ≤ ≤ p ( x ) + p ( y ) for all x , y ∈ ∈ X {\displaystyle p(x+y)\leq p(x)+p(y){\text{ for all }}x,y\in X} ; p ( 0 ) = 0..

{\displaystyle p(0)=0..} Symmetric : p ( − − x ) = p ( x ) for all x ∈ ∈ X .

{\displaystyle p(-x)=p(x){\text{ for all }}x\in X.} where we call a G-seminorm a G-norm if it satisfies the additional condition: Total / Positive definite : If p ( x ) = 0 {\displaystyle p(x)=0} then x = 0.

{\displaystyle x=0.} Properties of values [ edit ] If p {\displaystyle p} is a value on a vector space X {\displaystyle X} then: | p ( x ) − − p ( y ) | ≤ ≤ p ( x − − y ) for all x , y ∈ ∈ X .

{\displaystyle |p(x)-p(y)|\leq p(x-y){\text{ for all }}x,y\in X.} [ 3 ] p ( n x ) ≤ ≤ n p ( x ) {\displaystyle p(nx)\leq np(x)} and 1 n p ( x ) ≤ ≤ p ( x / n ) {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{n}}p(x)\leq p(x/n)} for all x ∈ ∈ X {\displaystyle x\in X} and positive integers n .

{\displaystyle n.} [ 4 ] The set { x ∈ ∈ X : p ( x ) = 0 } {\displaystyle \{x\in X:p(x)=0\}} is an additive subgroup of X .

{\displaystyle X.} [ 3 ] Equivalence on topological groups [ edit ] Theorem [ 2 ] — Suppose that X {\displaystyle X} is an additive commutative group. 
If d {\displaystyle d} is a translation invariant pseudometric on X {\displaystyle X} then the map p ( x ) := d ( x , 0 ) {\displaystyle p(x):=d(x,0)} is a value on X {\displaystyle X} called the value associated with d {\displaystyle d} , and moreover, d {\displaystyle d} generates a group topology on X {\displaystyle X} (i.e. the d {\displaystyle d} -topology on X {\displaystyle X} makes X {\displaystyle X} into a topological group).
Conversely, if p {\displaystyle p} is a value on X {\displaystyle X} then the map d ( x , y ) := p ( x − − y ) {\displaystyle d(x,y):=p(x-y)} is a translation-invariant pseudometric on X {\displaystyle X} and the value associated with d {\displaystyle d} is just p .

{\displaystyle p.} Pseudometrizable topological groups [ edit ] Theorem [ 2 ] — If ( X , τ τ ) {\displaystyle (X,\tau )} is an additive commutative topological group then the following are equivalent: τ τ {\displaystyle \tau } is induced by a pseudometric; (i.e.

( X , τ τ ) {\displaystyle (X,\tau )} is pseudometrizable); τ τ {\displaystyle \tau } is induced by a translation-invariant pseudometric; the identity element in ( X , τ τ ) {\displaystyle (X,\tau )} has a countable neighborhood basis.

If ( X , τ τ ) {\displaystyle (X,\tau )} is Hausdorff then the word "pseudometric" in the above statement may be replaced by the word "metric." 
A commutative topological group is metrizable if and only if it is Hausdorff and pseudometrizable.

An invariant pseudometric that doesn't induce a vector topology [ edit ] Let X {\displaystyle X} be a non-trivial (i.e.

X ≠ ≠ { 0 } {\displaystyle X\neq \{0\}} ) real or complex vector space and let d {\displaystyle d} be the translation-invariant trivial metric on X {\displaystyle X} defined by d ( x , x ) = 0 {\displaystyle d(x,x)=0} and d ( x , y ) = 1 for all x , y ∈ ∈ X {\displaystyle d(x,y)=1{\text{ for all }}x,y\in X} such that x ≠ ≠ y .

{\displaystyle x\neq y.} The topology τ τ {\displaystyle \tau } that d {\displaystyle d} induces on X {\displaystyle X} is the discrete topology , which makes ( X , τ τ ) {\displaystyle (X,\tau )} into a commutative topological group under addition but does not form a vector topology on X {\displaystyle X} because ( X , τ τ ) {\displaystyle (X,\tau )} is disconnected but every vector topology is connected. 
What fails is that scalar multiplication isn't continuous on ( X , τ τ ) .

{\displaystyle (X,\tau ).} This example shows that a translation-invariant (pseudo)metric is not enough to guarantee a vector topology, which leads us to define paranorms and F -seminorms.

Additive sequences [ edit ] A collection N {\displaystyle {\mathcal {N}}} of subsets of a vector space is called additive [ 5 ] if for every N ∈ ∈ N , {\displaystyle N\in {\mathcal {N}},} there exists some U ∈ ∈ N {\displaystyle U\in {\mathcal {N}}} such that U + U ⊆ ⊆ N .

{\displaystyle U+U\subseteq N.} Continuity of addition at 0 — If ( X , + ) {\displaystyle (X,+)} is a group (as all vector spaces are), τ τ {\displaystyle \tau } is a topology on X , {\displaystyle X,} and X × × X {\displaystyle X\times X} is endowed with the product topology , then the addition map X × × X → → X {\displaystyle X\times X\to X} (i.e. the map ( x , y ) ↦ ↦ x + y {\displaystyle (x,y)\mapsto x+y} ) is continuous at the origin of X × × X {\displaystyle X\times X} if and only if the set of neighborhoods of the origin in ( X , τ τ ) {\displaystyle (X,\tau )} is additive. This statement remains true if the word "neighborhood" is replaced by "open neighborhood." [ 5 ] All of the above conditions are consequently a necessary for a topology to form a vector topology. 
Additive sequences of sets have the particularly nice property that they define non-negative continuous real-valued subadditive functions. 
These functions can then be used to prove many of the basic properties of topological vector spaces and also show that a Hausdorff TVS with a countable basis of neighborhoods is metrizable. The following theorem is true more generally for commutative additive topological groups .

Theorem — Let U ∙ ∙ = ( U i ) i = 0 ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle U_{\bullet }=\left(U_{i}\right)_{i=0}^{\infty }} be a collection of subsets of a vector space such that 0 ∈ ∈ U i {\displaystyle 0\in U_{i}} and U i + 1 + U i + 1 ⊆ ⊆ U i {\displaystyle U_{i+1}+U_{i+1}\subseteq U_{i}} for all i ≥ ≥ 0.

{\displaystyle i\geq 0.} For all u ∈ ∈ U 0 , {\displaystyle u\in U_{0},} let S ( u ) := { n ∙ ∙ = ( n 1 , … … , n k ) : k ≥ ≥ 1 , n i ≥ ≥ 0 for all i , and u ∈ ∈ U n 1 + ⋯ ⋯ + U n k } .

{\displaystyle \mathbb {S} (u):=\left\{n_{\bullet }=\left(n_{1},\ldots ,n_{k}\right)~:~k\geq 1,n_{i}\geq 0{\text{ for all }}i,{\text{ and }}u\in U_{n_{1}}+\cdots +U_{n_{k}}\right\}.} Define f : X → → [ 0 , 1 ] {\displaystyle f:X\to [0,1]} by f ( x ) = 1 {\displaystyle f(x)=1} if x ∉ U 0 {\displaystyle x\not \in U_{0}} and otherwise let f ( x ) := inf { 2 − − n 1 + ⋯ ⋯ 2 − − n k : n ∙ ∙ = ( n 1 , … … , n k ) ∈ ∈ S ( x ) } .

{\displaystyle f(x):=\inf _{}\left\{2^{-n_{1}}+\cdots 2^{-n_{k}}~:~n_{\bullet }=\left(n_{1},\ldots ,n_{k}\right)\in \mathbb {S} (x)\right\}.} Then f {\displaystyle f} is subadditive (meaning f ( x + y ) ≤ ≤ f ( x ) + f ( y ) for all x , y ∈ ∈ X {\displaystyle f(x+y)\leq f(x)+f(y){\text{ for all }}x,y\in X} ) and f = 0 {\displaystyle f=0} on ⋂ ⋂ i ≥ ≥ 0 U i , {\displaystyle \bigcap _{i\geq 0}U_{i},} so in particular f ( 0 ) = 0.

{\displaystyle f(0)=0.} If all U i {\displaystyle U_{i}} are symmetric sets then f ( − − x ) = f ( x ) {\displaystyle f(-x)=f(x)} and if all U i {\displaystyle U_{i}} are balanced then f ( s x ) ≤ ≤ f ( x ) {\displaystyle f(sx)\leq f(x)} for all scalars s {\displaystyle s} such that | s | ≤ ≤ 1 {\displaystyle |s|\leq 1} and all x ∈ ∈ X .

{\displaystyle x\in X.} If X {\displaystyle X} is a topological vector space and if all U i {\displaystyle U_{i}} are neighborhoods of the origin then f {\displaystyle f} is continuous, where if in addition X {\displaystyle X} is Hausdorff and U ∙ ∙ {\displaystyle U_{\bullet }} forms a basis of balanced neighborhoods of the origin in X {\displaystyle X} then d ( x , y ) := f ( x − − y ) {\displaystyle d(x,y):=f(x-y)} is a metric defining the vector topology on X .

{\displaystyle X.} Proof Assume that n ∙ ∙ = ( n 1 , … … , n k ) {\displaystyle n_{\bullet }=\left(n_{1},\ldots ,n_{k}\right)} always denotes a finite sequence of non-negative integers and use the notation: ∑ ∑ 2 − − n ∙ ∙ := 2 − − n 1 + ⋯ ⋯ + 2 − − n k and ∑ ∑ U n ∙ ∙ := U n 1 + ⋯ ⋯ + U n k .

{\displaystyle \sum 2^{-n_{\bullet }}:=2^{-n_{1}}+\cdots +2^{-n_{k}}\quad {\text{ and }}\quad \sum U_{n_{\bullet }}:=U_{n_{1}}+\cdots +U_{n_{k}}.} For any integers n ≥ ≥ 0 {\displaystyle n\geq 0} and d > 2 , {\displaystyle d>2,} U n ⊇ ⊇ U n + 1 + U n + 1 ⊇ ⊇ U n + 1 + U n + 2 + U n + 2 ⊇ ⊇ U n + 1 + U n + 2 + ⋯ ⋯ + U n + d + U n + d + 1 + U n + d + 1 .

{\displaystyle U_{n}\supseteq U_{n+1}+U_{n+1}\supseteq U_{n+1}+U_{n+2}+U_{n+2}\supseteq U_{n+1}+U_{n+2}+\cdots +U_{n+d}+U_{n+d+1}+U_{n+d+1}.} From this it follows that if n ∙ ∙ = ( n 1 , … … , n k ) {\displaystyle n_{\bullet }=\left(n_{1},\ldots ,n_{k}\right)} consists of distinct positive integers then ∑ ∑ U n ∙ ∙ ⊆ ⊆ U − − 1 + min ( n ∙ ∙ ) .

{\displaystyle \sum U_{n_{\bullet }}\subseteq U_{-1+\min \left(n_{\bullet }\right)}.} It will now be shown by induction on k {\displaystyle k} that if n ∙ ∙ = ( n 1 , … … , n k ) {\displaystyle n_{\bullet }=\left(n_{1},\ldots ,n_{k}\right)} consists of non-negative integers such that ∑ ∑ 2 − − n ∙ ∙ ≤ ≤ 2 − − M {\displaystyle \sum 2^{-n_{\bullet }}\leq 2^{-M}} for some integer M ≥ ≥ 0 {\displaystyle M\geq 0} then ∑ ∑ U n ∙ ∙ ⊆ ⊆ U M .

{\displaystyle \sum U_{n_{\bullet }}\subseteq U_{M}.} This is clearly true for k = 1 {\displaystyle k=1} and k = 2 {\displaystyle k=2} so assume that k > 2 , {\displaystyle k>2,} which implies that all n i {\displaystyle n_{i}} are positive. 
If all n i {\displaystyle n_{i}} are distinct then this step is done, and otherwise pick distinct indices i < j {\displaystyle i<j} such that n i = n j {\displaystyle n_{i}=n_{j}} and construct m ∙ ∙ = ( m 1 , … … , m k − − 1 ) {\displaystyle m_{\bullet }=\left(m_{1},\ldots ,m_{k-1}\right)} from n ∙ ∙ {\displaystyle n_{\bullet }} by replacing each n i {\displaystyle n_{i}} with n i − − 1 {\displaystyle n_{i}-1} and deleting the j th {\displaystyle j^{\text{th}}} element of n ∙ ∙ {\displaystyle n_{\bullet }} (all other elements of n ∙ ∙ {\displaystyle n_{\bullet }} are transferred to m ∙ ∙ {\displaystyle m_{\bullet }} unchanged). 
Observe that ∑ ∑ 2 − − n ∙ ∙ = ∑ ∑ 2 − − m ∙ ∙ {\displaystyle \sum 2^{-n_{\bullet }}=\sum 2^{-m_{\bullet }}} and ∑ ∑ U n ∙ ∙ ⊆ ⊆ ∑ ∑ U m ∙ ∙ {\displaystyle \sum U_{n_{\bullet }}\subseteq \sum U_{m_{\bullet }}} (because U n i + U n j ⊆ ⊆ U n i − − 1 {\displaystyle U_{n_{i}}+U_{n_{j}}\subseteq U_{n_{i}-1}} ) so by appealing to the inductive hypothesis we conclude that ∑ ∑ U n ∙ ∙ ⊆ ⊆ ∑ ∑ U m ∙ ∙ ⊆ ⊆ U M , {\displaystyle \sum U_{n_{\bullet }}\subseteq \sum U_{m_{\bullet }}\subseteq U_{M},} as desired.

It is clear that f ( 0 ) = 0 {\displaystyle f(0)=0} and that 0 ≤ ≤ f ≤ ≤ 1 {\displaystyle 0\leq f\leq 1} so to prove that f {\displaystyle f} is subadditive, it suffices to prove that f ( x + y ) ≤ ≤ f ( x ) + f ( y ) {\displaystyle f(x+y)\leq f(x)+f(y)} when x , y ∈ ∈ X {\displaystyle x,y\in X} are such that f ( x ) + f ( y ) < 1 , {\displaystyle f(x)+f(y)<1,} which implies that x , y ∈ ∈ U 0 .

{\displaystyle x,y\in U_{0}.} This is an exercise. 
If all U i {\displaystyle U_{i}} are symmetric then x ∈ ∈ ∑ ∑ U n ∙ ∙ {\displaystyle x\in \sum U_{n_{\bullet }}} if and only if − − x ∈ ∈ ∑ ∑ U n ∙ ∙ {\displaystyle -x\in \sum U_{n_{\bullet }}} from which it follows that f ( − − x ) ≤ ≤ f ( x ) {\displaystyle f(-x)\leq f(x)} and f ( − − x ) ≥ ≥ f ( x ) .

{\displaystyle f(-x)\geq f(x).} If all U i {\displaystyle U_{i}} are balanced then the inequality f ( s x ) ≤ ≤ f ( x ) {\displaystyle f(sx)\leq f(x)} for all unit scalars s {\displaystyle s} such that | s | ≤ ≤ 1 {\displaystyle |s|\leq 1} is proved similarly. 
Because f {\displaystyle f} is a nonnegative subadditive function satisfying f ( 0 ) = 0 , {\displaystyle f(0)=0,} as described in the article on sublinear functionals , f {\displaystyle f} is uniformly continuous on X {\displaystyle X} if and only if f {\displaystyle f} is continuous at the origin. 
If all U i {\displaystyle U_{i}} are neighborhoods of the origin then for any real r > 0 , {\displaystyle r>0,} pick an integer M > 1 {\displaystyle M>1} such that 2 − − M < r {\displaystyle 2^{-M}<r} so that x ∈ ∈ U M {\displaystyle x\in U_{M}} implies f ( x ) ≤ ≤ 2 − − M < r .

{\displaystyle f(x)\leq 2^{-M}<r.} If the set of all U i {\displaystyle U_{i}} form basis of balanced neighborhoods of the origin then it may be shown that for any n > 1 , {\displaystyle n>1,} there exists some 0 < r ≤ ≤ 2 − − n {\displaystyle 0<r\leq 2^{-n}} such that f ( x ) < r {\displaystyle f(x)<r} implies x ∈ ∈ U n .

{\displaystyle x\in U_{n}.} ◼ ◼ {\displaystyle \blacksquare } Paranorms [ edit ] If X {\displaystyle X} is a vector space over the real or complex numbers then a paranorm on X {\displaystyle X} is a G-seminorm (defined above) p : X → → R {\displaystyle p:X\rightarrow \mathbb {R} } on X {\displaystyle X} that satisfies any of the following additional conditions, each of which begins with "for all sequences x ∙ ∙ = ( x i ) i = 1 ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle x_{\bullet }=\left(x_{i}\right)_{i=1}^{\infty }} in X {\displaystyle X} and all convergent sequences of scalars s ∙ ∙ = ( s i ) i = 1 ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle s_{\bullet }=\left(s_{i}\right)_{i=1}^{\infty }} ": [ 6 ] Continuity of multiplication : if s {\displaystyle s} is a scalar and x ∈ ∈ X {\displaystyle x\in X} are such that p ( x i − − x ) → → 0 {\displaystyle p\left(x_{i}-x\right)\to 0} and s ∙ ∙ → → s , {\displaystyle s_{\bullet }\to s,} then p ( s i x i − − s x ) → → 0.

{\displaystyle p\left(s_{i}x_{i}-sx\right)\to 0.} Both of the conditions: if s ∙ ∙ → → 0 {\displaystyle s_{\bullet }\to 0} and if x ∈ ∈ X {\displaystyle x\in X} is such that p ( x i − − x ) → → 0 {\displaystyle p\left(x_{i}-x\right)\to 0} then p ( s i x i ) → → 0 {\displaystyle p\left(s_{i}x_{i}\right)\to 0} ; if p ( x ∙ ∙ ) → → 0 {\displaystyle p\left(x_{\bullet }\right)\to 0} then p ( s x i ) → → 0 {\displaystyle p\left(sx_{i}\right)\to 0} for every scalar s .

{\displaystyle s.} Both of the conditions: if p ( x ∙ ∙ ) → → 0 {\displaystyle p\left(x_{\bullet }\right)\to 0} and s ∙ ∙ → → s {\displaystyle s_{\bullet }\to s} for some scalar s {\displaystyle s} then p ( s i x i ) → → 0 {\displaystyle p\left(s_{i}x_{i}\right)\to 0} ; if s ∙ ∙ → → 0 {\displaystyle s_{\bullet }\to 0} then p ( s i x ) → → 0 for all x ∈ ∈ X .

{\displaystyle p\left(s_{i}x\right)\to 0{\text{ for all }}x\in X.} Separate continuity : [ 7 ] if s ∙ ∙ → → s {\displaystyle s_{\bullet }\to s} for some scalar s {\displaystyle s} then p ( s x i − − s x ) → → 0 {\displaystyle p\left(sx_{i}-sx\right)\to 0} for every x ∈ ∈ X {\displaystyle x\in X} ; if s {\displaystyle s} is a scalar, x ∈ ∈ X , {\displaystyle x\in X,} and p ( x i − − x ) → → 0 {\displaystyle p\left(x_{i}-x\right)\to 0} then p ( s x i − − s x ) → → 0 {\displaystyle p\left(sx_{i}-sx\right)\to 0} .

A paranorm is called total if in addition it satisfies: Total / Positive definite : p ( x ) = 0 {\displaystyle p(x)=0} implies x = 0.

{\displaystyle x=0.} Properties of paranorms [ edit ] If p {\displaystyle p} is a paranorm on a vector space X {\displaystyle X} then the map d : X × × X → → R {\displaystyle d:X\times X\rightarrow \mathbb {R} } defined by d ( x , y ) := p ( x − − y ) {\displaystyle d(x,y):=p(x-y)} is a translation-invariant pseudometric on X {\displaystyle X} that defines a vector topology on X .

{\displaystyle X.} [ 8 ] If p {\displaystyle p} is a paranorm on a vector space X {\displaystyle X} then: the set { x ∈ ∈ X : p ( x ) = 0 } {\displaystyle \{x\in X:p(x)=0\}} is a vector subspace of X .

{\displaystyle X.} [ 8 ] p ( x + n ) = p ( x ) for all x , n ∈ ∈ X {\displaystyle p(x+n)=p(x){\text{ for all }}x,n\in X} with p ( n ) = 0.

{\displaystyle p(n)=0.} [ 8 ] If a paranorm p {\displaystyle p} satisfies p ( s x ) ≤ ≤ | s | p ( x ) for all x ∈ ∈ X {\displaystyle p(sx)\leq |s|p(x){\text{ for all }}x\in X} and scalars s , {\displaystyle s,} then p {\displaystyle p} is absolutely homogeneity (i.e. equality holds) [ 8 ] and thus p {\displaystyle p} is a seminorm .

Examples of paranorms [ edit ] If d {\displaystyle d} is a translation-invariant pseudometric on a vector space X {\displaystyle X} that induces a vector topology τ τ {\displaystyle \tau } on X {\displaystyle X} (i.e.

( X , τ τ ) {\displaystyle (X,\tau )} is a TVS) then the map p ( x ) := d ( x − − y , 0 ) {\displaystyle p(x):=d(x-y,0)} defines a continuous paranorm on ( X , τ τ ) {\displaystyle (X,\tau )} ; moreover, the topology that this paranorm p {\displaystyle p} defines in X {\displaystyle X} is τ τ .

{\displaystyle \tau .} [ 8 ] If p {\displaystyle p} is a paranorm on X {\displaystyle X} then so is the map q ( x ) := p ( x ) / [ 1 + p ( x ) ] .

{\displaystyle q(x):=p(x)/[1+p(x)].} [ 8 ] Every positive scalar multiple of a paranorm (resp. total paranorm) is again such a paranorm (resp. total paranorm).

Every seminorm is a paranorm.

[ 8 ] The restriction of an paranorm (resp. total paranorm) to a vector subspace is an paranorm (resp. total paranorm).

[ 9 ] The sum of two paranorms is a paranorm.

[ 8 ] If p {\displaystyle p} and q {\displaystyle q} are paranorms on X {\displaystyle X} then so is ( p ∧ ∧ q ) ( x ) := inf { p ( y ) + q ( z ) : x = y + z with y , z ∈ ∈ X } .

{\displaystyle (p\wedge q)(x):=\inf _{}\{p(y)+q(z):x=y+z{\text{ with }}y,z\in X\}.} Moreover, ( p ∧ ∧ q ) ≤ ≤ p {\displaystyle (p\wedge q)\leq p} and ( p ∧ ∧ q ) ≤ ≤ q .

{\displaystyle (p\wedge q)\leq q.} This makes the set of paranorms on X {\displaystyle X} into a conditionally complete lattice .

[ 8 ] Each of the following real-valued maps are paranorms on X := R 2 {\displaystyle X:=\mathbb {R} ^{2}} : ( x , y ) ↦ ↦ | x | {\displaystyle (x,y)\mapsto |x|} ( x , y ) ↦ ↦ | x | + | y | {\displaystyle (x,y)\mapsto |x|+|y|} The real-valued maps ( x , y ) ↦ ↦ | x 2 − − y 2 | {\displaystyle (x,y)\mapsto {\sqrt {\left|x^{2}-y^{2}\right|}}} and ( x , y ) ↦ ↦ | x 2 − − y 2 | 3 / 2 {\displaystyle (x,y)\mapsto \left|x^{2}-y^{2}\right|^{3/2}} are not paranorms on X := R 2 .

{\displaystyle X:=\mathbb {R} ^{2}.} [ 8 ] If x ∙ ∙ = ( x i ) i ∈ ∈ I {\displaystyle x_{\bullet }=\left(x_{i}\right)_{i\in I}} is a Hamel basis on a vector space X {\displaystyle X} then the real-valued map that sends x = ∑ ∑ i ∈ ∈ I s i x i ∈ ∈ X {\displaystyle x=\sum _{i\in I}s_{i}x_{i}\in X} (where all but finitely many of the scalars s i {\displaystyle s_{i}} are 0) to ∑ ∑ i ∈ ∈ I | s i | {\displaystyle \sum _{i\in I}{\sqrt {\left|s_{i}\right|}}} is a paranorm on X , {\displaystyle X,} which satisfies p ( s x ) = | s | p ( x ) {\displaystyle p(sx)={\sqrt {|s|}}p(x)} for all x ∈ ∈ X {\displaystyle x\in X} and scalars s .

{\displaystyle s.} [ 8 ] The function p ( x ) := | sin ⁡ ⁡ ( π π x ) | + min { 2 , | x | } {\displaystyle p(x):=|\sin(\pi x)|+\min\{2,|x|\}} is a paranorm on R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } that is not balanced but nevertheless equivalent to the usual norm on R .

{\displaystyle R.} Note that the function x ↦ ↦ | sin ⁡ ⁡ ( π π x ) | {\displaystyle x\mapsto |\sin(\pi x)|} is subadditive.

{\displaystyle X_{\mathbb {R} }.} [ 9 ] F -seminorms [ edit ] If X {\displaystyle X} is a vector space over the real or complex numbers then an F -seminorm on X {\displaystyle X} (the F {\displaystyle F} stands for Fréchet ) is a real-valued map p : X → → R {\displaystyle p:X\to \mathbb {R} } with the following four properties: [ 11 ] Non-negative : p ≥ ≥ 0.

{\displaystyle p\geq 0.} Subadditive : p ( x + y ) ≤ ≤ p ( x ) + p ( y ) {\displaystyle p(x+y)\leq p(x)+p(y)} for all x , y ∈ ∈ X {\displaystyle x,y\in X} Balanced : p ( a x ) ≤ ≤ p ( x ) {\displaystyle p(ax)\leq p(x)} for x ∈ ∈ X {\displaystyle x\in X} all scalars a {\displaystyle a} satisfying | a | ≤ ≤ 1 ; {\displaystyle |a|\leq 1;} This condition guarantees that each set of the form { z ∈ ∈ X : p ( z ) ≤ ≤ r } {\displaystyle \{z\in X:p(z)\leq r\}} or { z ∈ ∈ X : p ( z ) < r } {\displaystyle \{z\in X:p(z)<r\}} for some r ≥ ≥ 0 {\displaystyle r\geq 0} is a balanced set .

For every x ∈ ∈ X , {\displaystyle x\in X,} p ( 1 n x ) → → 0 {\displaystyle p\left({\tfrac {1}{n}}x\right)\to 0} as n → → ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle n\to \infty } The sequence ( 1 n ) n = 1 ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \left({\tfrac {1}{n}}\right)_{n=1}^{\infty }} can be replaced by any positive sequence converging to the zero.

[ 12 ] An F -seminorm is called an F -norm if in addition it satisfies: Total / Positive definite : p ( x ) = 0 {\displaystyle p(x)=0} implies x = 0.

{\displaystyle x=0.} An F -seminorm is called monotone if it satisfies: Monotone : p ( r x ) < p ( s x ) {\displaystyle p(rx)<p(sx)} for all non-zero x ∈ ∈ X {\displaystyle x\in X} and all real s {\displaystyle s} and t {\displaystyle t} such that s < t .

{\displaystyle s<t.} [ 12 ] F -seminormed spaces [ edit ] An F -seminormed space (resp.

F -normed space ) [ 12 ] is a pair ( X , p ) {\displaystyle (X,p)} consisting of a vector space X {\displaystyle X} and an F -seminorm (resp.

F -norm) p {\displaystyle p} on X .

{\displaystyle X.} If ( X , p ) {\displaystyle (X,p)} and ( Z , q ) {\displaystyle (Z,q)} are F -seminormed spaces then a map f : X → → Z {\displaystyle f:X\to Z} is called an isometric embedding [ 12 ] if q ( f ( x ) − − f ( y ) ) = p ( x , y ) for all x , y ∈ ∈ X .

{\displaystyle q(f(x)-f(y))=p(x,y){\text{ for all }}x,y\in X.} Every isometric embedding of one F -seminormed space into another is a topological embedding , but the converse is not true in general.

If p {\displaystyle p} and q {\displaystyle q} are F -seminorms on X {\displaystyle X} then so is their pointwise supremum x ↦ ↦ sup { p ( x ) , q ( x ) } .

[ 9 ] A non-negative real-valued function on X {\displaystyle X} is a seminorm if and only if it is a convex F -seminorm, or equivalently, if and only if it is a convex balanced G -seminorm.

[ 10 ] In particular, every seminorm is an F -seminorm.

For any 0 < p < 1 , {\displaystyle 0<p<1,} the map f {\displaystyle f} on R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} defined by [ f ( x 1 , … … , x n ) ] p = | x 1 | p + ⋯ ⋯ | x n | p {\displaystyle [f\left(x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n}\right)]^{p}=\left|x_{1}\right|^{p}+\cdots \left|x_{n}\right|^{p}} is an F -norm that is not a norm.

If L : X → → Y {\displaystyle L:X\to Y} is a linear map and if q {\displaystyle q} is an F -seminorm on Y , {\displaystyle Y,} then q ∘ ∘ L {\displaystyle q\circ L} is an F -seminorm on X .

{\displaystyle x\in X.} Topology induced by a single F -seminorm [ edit ] Theorem [ 11 ] — Let p {\displaystyle p} be an F -seminorm on a vector space X .

{\displaystyle X.} Then the map d : X × × X → → R {\displaystyle d:X\times X\to \mathbb {R} } defined by d ( x , y ) := p ( x − − y ) {\displaystyle d(x,y):=p(x-y)} is a translation invariant pseudometric on X {\displaystyle X} that defines a vector topology τ τ {\displaystyle \tau } on X .

{\displaystyle X.} If p {\displaystyle p} is an F -norm then d {\displaystyle d} is a metric. 
When X {\displaystyle X} is endowed with this topology then p {\displaystyle p} is a continuous map on X .

{\displaystyle X.} The balanced sets { x ∈ ∈ X : p ( x ) ≤ ≤ r } , {\displaystyle \{x\in X~:~p(x)\leq r\},} as r {\displaystyle r} ranges over the positive reals, form a neighborhood basis at the origin for this topology consisting of closed set. 
Similarly, the balanced sets { x ∈ ∈ X : p ( x ) < r } , {\displaystyle \{x\in X~:~p(x)<r\},} as r {\displaystyle r} ranges over the positive reals, form a neighborhood basis at the origin for this topology consisting of open sets.

Topology induced by a family of F -seminorms [ edit ] Suppose that L {\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}} is a non-empty collection of F -seminorms on a vector space X {\displaystyle X} and for any finite subset F ⊆ ⊆ L {\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}\subseteq {\mathcal {L}}} and any r > 0 , {\displaystyle r>0,} let U F , r := ⋂ ⋂ p ∈ ∈ F { x ∈ ∈ X : p ( x ) < r } .

{\displaystyle U_{{\mathcal {F}},r}:=\bigcap _{p\in {\mathcal {F}}}\{x\in X:p(x)<r\}.} The set { U F , r : r > 0 , F ⊆ ⊆ L , F finite } {\displaystyle \left\{U_{{\mathcal {F}},r}~:~r>0,{\mathcal {F}}\subseteq {\mathcal {L}},{\mathcal {F}}{\text{ finite }}\right\}} forms a filter base on X {\displaystyle X} that also forms a neighborhood basis at the origin for a vector topology on X {\displaystyle X} denoted by τ τ L .

{\displaystyle \tau _{\mathcal {L}}.} [ 12 ] Each U F , r {\displaystyle U_{{\mathcal {F}},r}} is a balanced and absorbing subset of X .

{\displaystyle X.} [ 12 ] These sets satisfy [ 12 ] U F , r / 2 + U F , r / 2 ⊆ ⊆ U F , r .

{\displaystyle U_{{\mathcal {F}},r/2}+U_{{\mathcal {F}},r/2}\subseteq U_{{\mathcal {F}},r}.} τ τ L {\displaystyle \tau _{\mathcal {L}}} is the coarsest vector topology on X {\displaystyle X} making each p ∈ ∈ L {\displaystyle p\in {\mathcal {L}}} continuous.

[ 12 ] τ τ L {\displaystyle \tau _{\mathcal {L}}} is Hausdorff if and only if for every non-zero x ∈ ∈ X , {\displaystyle x\in X,} there exists some p ∈ ∈ L {\displaystyle p\in {\mathcal {L}}} such that p ( x ) > 0.

{\displaystyle p(x)>0.} [ 12 ] If F {\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}} is the set of all continuous F -seminorms on ( X , τ τ L ) {\displaystyle \left(X,\tau _{\mathcal {L}}\right)} then τ τ L = τ τ F .

{\displaystyle \tau _{\mathcal {L}}=\tau _{\mathcal {F}}.} [ 12 ] If F {\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}} is the set of all pointwise suprema of non-empty finite subsets of F {\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}} of L {\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}} then F {\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}} is a directed family of F -seminorms and τ τ L = τ τ F .

{\displaystyle \tau _{\mathcal {L}}=\tau _{\mathcal {F}}.} [ 12 ] Fréchet combination [ edit ] Suppose that p ∙ ∙ = ( p i ) i = 1 ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle p_{\bullet }=\left(p_{i}\right)_{i=1}^{\infty }} is a family of non-negative subadditive functions on a vector space X .

{\displaystyle X.} The Fréchet combination [ 8 ] of p ∙ ∙ {\displaystyle p_{\bullet }} is defined to be the real-valued map p ( x ) := ∑ ∑ i = 1 ∞ ∞ p i ( x ) 2 i [ 1 + p i ( x ) ] .

{\displaystyle p(x):=\sum _{i=1}^{\infty }{\frac {p_{i}(x)}{2^{i}\left[1+p_{i}(x)\right]}}.} As an F -seminorm [ edit ] Assume that p ∙ ∙ = ( p i ) i = 1 ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle p_{\bullet }=\left(p_{i}\right)_{i=1}^{\infty }} is an increasing sequence of seminorms on X {\displaystyle X} and let p {\displaystyle p} be the Fréchet combination of p ∙ ∙ .

{\displaystyle p_{\bullet }.} Then p {\displaystyle p} is an F -seminorm on X {\displaystyle X} that induces the same locally convex topology as the family p ∙ ∙ {\displaystyle p_{\bullet }} of seminorms.

[ 13 ] Since p ∙ ∙ = ( p i ) i = 1 ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle p_{\bullet }=\left(p_{i}\right)_{i=1}^{\infty }} is increasing, a basis of open neighborhoods of the origin consists of all sets of the form { x ∈ ∈ X : p i ( x ) < r } {\displaystyle \left\{x\in X~:~p_{i}(x)<r\right\}} as i {\displaystyle i} ranges over all positive integers and r > 0 {\displaystyle r>0} ranges over all positive real numbers.

The translation invariant pseudometric on X {\displaystyle X} induced by this F -seminorm p {\displaystyle p} is d ( x , y ) = ∑ ∑ i = 1 ∞ ∞ 1 2 i p i ( x − − y ) 1 + p i ( x − − y ) .

{\displaystyle d(x,y)=\sum _{i=1}^{\infty }{\frac {1}{2^{i}}}{\frac {p_{i}(x-y)}{1+p_{i}(x-y)}}.} This metric was discovered by Fréchet in his 1906 thesis for the spaces of real and complex sequences with pointwise operations.

[ 14 ] As a paranorm [ edit ] If each p i {\displaystyle p_{i}} is a paranorm then so is p {\displaystyle p} and moreover, p {\displaystyle p} induces the same topology on X {\displaystyle X} as the family p ∙ ∙ {\displaystyle p_{\bullet }} of paranorms.

[ 8 ] This is also true of the following paranorms on X {\displaystyle X} : q ( x ) := inf { ∑ ∑ i = 1 n p i ( x ) + 1 n : n > 0 is an integer } .

{\displaystyle q(x):=\inf _{}\left\{\sum _{i=1}^{n}p_{i}(x)+{\frac {1}{n}}~:~n>0{\text{ is an integer }}\right\}.} [ 8 ] r ( x ) := ∑ ∑ n = 1 ∞ ∞ min { 1 2 n , p n ( x ) } .

{\displaystyle r(x):=\sum _{n=1}^{\infty }\min \left\{{\frac {1}{2^{n}}},p_{n}(x)\right\}.} [ 8 ] Generalization [ edit ] The Fréchet combination can be generalized by use of a bounded remetrization function.

A bounded remetrization function [ 15 ] is a continuous non-negative non-decreasing map R : [ 0 , ∞ ∞ ) → → [ 0 , ∞ ∞ ) {\displaystyle R:[0,\infty )\to [0,\infty )} that has a bounded range, is subadditive (meaning that R ( s + t ) ≤ ≤ R ( s ) + R ( t ) {\displaystyle R(s+t)\leq R(s)+R(t)} for all s , t ≥ ≥ 0 {\displaystyle s,t\geq 0} ), and satisfies R ( s ) = 0 {\displaystyle R(s)=0} if and only if s = 0.

{\displaystyle s=0.} Examples of bounded remetrization functions include arctan ⁡ ⁡ t , {\displaystyle \arctan t,} tanh ⁡ ⁡ t , {\displaystyle \tanh t,} t ↦ ↦ min { t , 1 } , {\displaystyle t\mapsto \min\{t,1\},} and t ↦ ↦ t 1 + t .

{\displaystyle t\mapsto {\frac {t}{1+t}}.} [ 15 ] If d {\displaystyle d} is a pseudometric (respectively, metric) on X {\displaystyle X} and R {\displaystyle R} is a bounded remetrization function then R ∘ ∘ d {\displaystyle R\circ d} is a bounded pseudometric (respectively, bounded metric) on X {\displaystyle X} that is uniformly equivalent to d .

{\displaystyle d.} [ 15 ] Suppose that p ∙ ∙ = ( p i ) i = 1 ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle p_{\bullet }=\left(p_{i}\right)_{i=1}^{\infty }} is a family of non-negative F -seminorm on a vector space X , {\displaystyle X,} R {\displaystyle R} is a bounded remetrization function, and r ∙ ∙ = ( r i ) i = 1 ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle r_{\bullet }=\left(r_{i}\right)_{i=1}^{\infty }} is a sequence of positive real numbers whose sum is finite. 
Then p ( x ) := ∑ ∑ i = 1 ∞ ∞ r i R ( p i ( x ) ) {\displaystyle p(x):=\sum _{i=1}^{\infty }r_{i}R\left(p_{i}(x)\right)} defines a bounded F -seminorm that is uniformly equivalent to the p ∙ ∙ .

{\displaystyle p_{\bullet }.} [ 16 ] It has the property that for any net x ∙ ∙ = ( x a ) a ∈ ∈ A {\displaystyle x_{\bullet }=\left(x_{a}\right)_{a\in A}} in X , {\displaystyle X,} p ( x ∙ ∙ ) → → 0 {\displaystyle p\left(x_{\bullet }\right)\to 0} if and only if p i ( x ∙ ∙ ) → → 0 {\displaystyle p_{i}\left(x_{\bullet }\right)\to 0} for all i .

{\displaystyle i.} [ 16 ] p {\displaystyle p} is an F -norm if and only if the p ∙ ∙ {\displaystyle p_{\bullet }} separate points on X .

{\displaystyle X.} [ 16 ] Characterizations [ edit ] Of (pseudo)metrics induced by (semi)norms [ edit ] A pseudometric (resp. metric) d {\displaystyle d} is induced by a seminorm (resp. norm) on a vector space X {\displaystyle X} if and only if d {\displaystyle d} is translation invariant and absolutely homogeneous , which means that  for all scalars s {\displaystyle s} and all x , y ∈ ∈ X , {\displaystyle x,y\in X,} in which case the function defined by p ( x ) := d ( x , 0 ) {\displaystyle p(x):=d(x,0)} is a seminorm (resp. norm) and the pseudometric (resp. metric) induced by p {\displaystyle p} is equal to d .

{\displaystyle X.} ( X , τ τ ) {\displaystyle (X,\tau )} is metrizable (as a topological space).

There is a translation-invariant metric on X {\displaystyle X} that induces on X {\displaystyle X} the topology τ τ , {\displaystyle \tau ,} which is the given topology on X .

{\displaystyle X.} By the Birkhoff–Kakutani theorem, it follows that there is an equivalent metric that is translation-invariant.

Of locally convex pseudometrizable TVS [ edit ] If ( X , τ τ ) {\displaystyle (X,\tau )} is TVS then the following are equivalent: [ 13 ] X {\displaystyle X} is locally convex and pseudometrizable.

X {\displaystyle X} has a countable neighborhood base at the origin consisting of convex sets.

The topology of X {\displaystyle X} is induced by a countable family of (continuous) seminorms.

The topology of X {\displaystyle X} is induced by a countable increasing sequence of (continuous) seminorms ( p i ) i = 1 ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \left(p_{i}\right)_{i=1}^{\infty }} (increasing means that for all i , {\displaystyle i,} p i ≥ ≥ p i + 1 .

{\displaystyle p_{i}\geq p_{i+1}.} The topology of X {\displaystyle X} is induced by an F -seminorm of the form: p ( x ) = ∑ ∑ n = 1 ∞ ∞ 2 − − n arctan ⁡ ⁡ p n ( x ) {\displaystyle p(x)=\sum _{n=1}^{\infty }2^{-n}\operatorname {arctan} p_{n}(x)} where ( p i ) i = 1 ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \left(p_{i}\right)_{i=1}^{\infty }} are (continuous) seminorms on X .

{\displaystyle X.} [ 18 ] Quotients [ edit ] Let M {\displaystyle M} be a vector subspace of a topological vector space ( X , τ τ ) .

{\displaystyle (X,\tau ).} If X {\displaystyle X} is a pseudometrizable TVS then so is X / M .

{\displaystyle X/M.} [ 11 ] If X {\displaystyle X} is a complete pseudometrizable TVS and M {\displaystyle M} is a closed vector subspace of X {\displaystyle X} then X / M {\displaystyle X/M} is complete.

[ 11 ] If X {\displaystyle X} is metrizable TVS and M {\displaystyle M} is a closed vector subspace of X {\displaystyle X} then X / M {\displaystyle X/M} is metrizable.

[ 11 ] If p {\displaystyle p} is an F -seminorm on X , {\displaystyle X,} then the map P : X / M → → R {\displaystyle P:X/M\to \mathbb {R} } defined by P ( x + M ) := inf { p ( x + m ) : m ∈ ∈ M } {\displaystyle P(x+M):=\inf _{}\{p(x+m):m\in M\}} is an F -seminorm on X / M {\displaystyle X/M} that induces the usual quotient topology on X / M .

{\displaystyle X/M.} [ 11 ] If in addition p {\displaystyle p} is an F -norm on X {\displaystyle X} and if M {\displaystyle M} is a closed vector subspace of X {\displaystyle X} then P {\displaystyle P} is an F -norm on X .

{\displaystyle X.} [ 11 ] Examples and sufficient conditions [ edit ] Every seminormed space ( X , p ) {\displaystyle (X,p)} is pseudometrizable with a canonical pseudometric given by d ( x , y ) := p ( x − − y ) {\displaystyle d(x,y):=p(x-y)} for all x , y ∈ ∈ X .

{\displaystyle x,y\in X.} [ 19 ] .

If ( X , d ) {\displaystyle (X,d)} is pseudometric TVS with a translation invariant pseudometric d , {\displaystyle d,} then p ( x ) := d ( x , 0 ) {\displaystyle p(x):=d(x,0)} defines a paranorm.

[ 20 ] However, if d {\displaystyle d} is a translation invariant pseudometric on the vector space X {\displaystyle X} (without the addition condition that ( X , d ) {\displaystyle (X,d)} is pseudometric TVS ), then d {\displaystyle d} need not be either an F -seminorm [ 21 ] nor a paranorm.

If a TVS has a bounded neighborhood of the origin then it is pseudometrizable; the converse is in general false.

[ 14 ] If a Hausdorff TVS has a bounded neighborhood of the origin then it is metrizable.

[ 14 ] Suppose X {\displaystyle X} is either a DF-space or an LM-space . If X {\displaystyle X} is a sequential space then it is either metrizable or else a Montel DF-space.

If X {\displaystyle X} is Hausdorff locally convex TVS then X {\displaystyle X} with the strong topology , ( X , b ( X , X ′ ′ ) ) , {\displaystyle \left(X,b\left(X,X^{\prime }\right)\right),} is metrizable if and only if there exists a countable set B {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}} of bounded subsets of X {\displaystyle X} such that every bounded subset of X {\displaystyle X} is contained in some element of B .

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}.} [ 22 ] The strong dual space X b ′ ′ {\displaystyle X_{b}^{\prime }} of a metrizable locally convex space (such as a Fréchet space [ 23 ] ) X {\displaystyle X} is a DF-space .

[ 24 ] The strong dual of a DF-space is a Fréchet space .

[ 25 ] The strong dual of a reflexive Fréchet space is a bornological space .

[ 24 ] The strong bidual (that is, the strong dual space of the strong dual space) of a metrizable locally convex space is a Fréchet space.

[ 26 ] If X {\displaystyle X} is a metrizable locally convex space then its strong dual X b ′ ′ {\displaystyle X_{b}^{\prime }} has one of the following properties, if and only if it has all of these properties: (1) bornological , (2) infrabarreled , (3) barreled .

[ 26 ] Normability [ edit ] A topological vector space is seminormable if and only if it has a convex bounded neighborhood of the origin. 
Moreover, a TVS is normable if and only if it is Hausdorff and seminormable.

[ 14 ] Every metrizable TVS on a finite- dimensional vector space is a normable locally convex complete TVS , being TVS-isomorphic to Euclidean space . Consequently, any metrizable TVS that is not normable must be infinite dimensional.

If M {\displaystyle M} is a metrizable locally convex TVS that possess a countable fundamental system of bounded sets, then M {\displaystyle M} is normable.

[ 27 ] If X {\displaystyle X} is a Hausdorff locally convex space then the following are equivalent: X {\displaystyle X} is normable .

X {\displaystyle X} has a (von Neumann) bounded neighborhood of the origin.

the strong dual space X b ′ ′ {\displaystyle X_{b}^{\prime }} of X {\displaystyle X} is normable.

[ 28 ] and if this locally convex space X {\displaystyle X} is also metrizable, then the following may be appended to this list: the strong dual space of X {\displaystyle X} is metrizable.

[ 28 ] the strong dual space of X {\displaystyle X} is a Fréchet–Urysohn locally convex space.

[ 23 ] In particular, if a metrizable locally convex space X {\displaystyle X} (such as a Fréchet space ) is not normable then its strong dual space X b ′ ′ {\displaystyle X_{b}^{\prime }} is not a Fréchet–Urysohn space and consequently, this complete Hausdorff locally convex space X b ′ ′ {\displaystyle X_{b}^{\prime }} is also neither metrizable nor normable.

Another consequence of this is that if X {\displaystyle X} is a reflexive locally convex TVS whose strong dual X b ′ ′ {\displaystyle X_{b}^{\prime }} is metrizable then X b ′ ′ {\displaystyle X_{b}^{\prime }} is necessarily a reflexive Fréchet space, X {\displaystyle X} is a DF-space , both X {\displaystyle X} and X b ′ ′ {\displaystyle X_{b}^{\prime }} are necessarily complete Hausdorff ultrabornological distinguished webbed spaces , and moreover, X b ′ ′ {\displaystyle X_{b}^{\prime }} is normable if and only if X {\displaystyle X} is normable if and only if X {\displaystyle X} is Fréchet–Urysohn if and only if X {\displaystyle X} is metrizable. In particular, such a space X {\displaystyle X} is either a Banach space or else it is not even a Fréchet–Urysohn space.

Metrically bounded sets and bounded sets [ edit ] Suppose that ( X , d ) {\displaystyle (X,d)} is a pseudometric space and B ⊆ ⊆ X .

{\displaystyle B\subseteq X.} The set B {\displaystyle B} is metrically bounded or d {\displaystyle d} -bounded if there exists a real number R > 0 {\displaystyle R>0} such that d ( x , y ) ≤ ≤ R {\displaystyle d(x,y)\leq R} for all x , y ∈ ∈ B {\displaystyle x,y\in B} ; 
the smallest such R {\displaystyle R} is then called the diameter or d {\displaystyle d} -diameter of B .

{\displaystyle B.} [ 14 ] If B {\displaystyle B} is bounded in a pseudometrizable TVS X {\displaystyle X} then it is metrically bounded; 
the converse is in general false but it is true for locally convex metrizable TVSs.

[ 14 ] Properties of pseudometrizable TVS [ edit ] Theorem [ 29 ] — All infinite-dimensional separable complete metrizable TVS are homeomorphic .

Every metrizable locally convex TVS is a quasibarrelled space , [ 30 ] bornological space , and a Mackey space .

Every complete pseudo metrizable TVS is a barrelled space and a Baire space (and hence non-meager).

[ 31 ] However, there exist metrizable Baire spaces that are not complete .

[ 31 ] If X {\displaystyle X} is a metrizable locally convex space, then the strong dual of X {\displaystyle X} is bornological if and only if it is barreled , if and only if it is infrabarreled .

[ 26 ] If X {\displaystyle X} is a complete pseudometrizable TVS and M {\displaystyle M} is a closed vector subspace of X , {\displaystyle X,} then X / M {\displaystyle X/M} is complete.

[ 11 ] The strong dual of a locally convex metrizable TVS is a webbed space .

[ 32 ] If ( X , τ τ ) {\displaystyle (X,\tau )} and ( X , ν ν ) {\displaystyle (X,\nu )} are complete metrizable TVSs (i.e.

F-spaces ) and if ν ν {\displaystyle \nu } is coarser than τ τ {\displaystyle \tau } then τ τ = ν ν {\displaystyle \tau =\nu } ; [ 33 ] this is no longer guaranteed to be true if any one of these metrizable TVSs is not complete.

[ 34 ] Said differently, if ( X , τ τ ) {\displaystyle (X,\tau )} and ( X , ν ν ) {\displaystyle (X,\nu )} are both F-spaces but with different topologies, then neither one of τ τ {\displaystyle \tau } and ν ν {\displaystyle \nu } contains the other as a subset. One particular consequence of this is, for example, that if ( X , p ) {\displaystyle (X,p)} is a Banach space and ( X , q ) {\displaystyle (X,q)} is some other normed space whose norm-induced topology is finer than (or alternatively, is coarser than) that of ( X , p ) {\displaystyle (X,p)} (i.e. if p ≤ ≤ C q {\displaystyle p\leq Cq} or if q ≤ ≤ C p {\displaystyle q\leq Cp} for some constant C > 0 {\displaystyle C>0} ), then the only way that ( X , q ) {\displaystyle (X,q)} can be a Banach space (i.e. also be complete) is if these two norms p {\displaystyle p} and q {\displaystyle q} are equivalent ; if they are not equivalent, then ( X , q ) {\displaystyle (X,q)} can not be a Banach space. 
As another consequence, if ( X , p ) {\displaystyle (X,p)} is a Banach space and ( X , ν ν ) {\displaystyle (X,\nu )} is a Fréchet space , then the map p : ( X , ν ν ) → → R {\displaystyle p:(X,\nu )\to \mathbb {R} } is continuous if and only if the Fréchet space ( X , ν ν ) {\displaystyle (X,\nu )} is the TVS ( X , p ) {\displaystyle (X,p)} (here, the Banach space ( X , p ) {\displaystyle (X,p)} is being considered as a TVS, which means that its norm is " forgetten " but its topology is remembered).

A metrizable locally convex space is normable if and only if its strong dual space is a Fréchet–Urysohn locally convex space.

[ 23 ] Any product of complete metrizable TVSs is a Baire space .

[ 31 ] A product of metrizable TVSs is metrizable if and only if it all but at most countably many of these TVSs have dimension 0.

{\displaystyle 0.} [ 35 ] A product of pseudometrizable TVSs is pseudometrizable if and only if it all but at most countably many of these TVSs have the trivial topology.

Every complete pseudo metrizable TVS is a barrelled space and a Baire space (and thus non-meager).

[ 31 ] The dimension of a complete metrizable TVS is either finite or uncountable.

[ 35 ] Completeness [ edit ] Main article: Complete topological vector space Every topological vector space (and more generally, a topological group ) has a canonical uniform structure , induced by its topology, which allows the notions of completeness and uniform continuity to be applied to it. 
If X {\displaystyle X} is a metrizable TVS and d {\displaystyle d} is a metric that defines X {\displaystyle X} 's topology, then its possible that X {\displaystyle X} is complete as a TVS (i.e. relative to its uniformity) but the metric d {\displaystyle d} is not a complete metric (such metrics exist even for X = R {\displaystyle X=\mathbb {R} } ). 
Thus, if X {\displaystyle X} is a TVS whose topology is induced by a pseudometric d , {\displaystyle d,} then the notion of completeness of X {\displaystyle X} (as a TVS) and the notion of completeness of the pseudometric space ( X , d ) {\displaystyle (X,d)} are not always equivalent. 
The next theorem gives a condition for when they are equivalent: Theorem — If X {\displaystyle X} is a pseudometrizable TVS whose topology is induced by a translation invariant pseudometric d , {\displaystyle d,} then d {\displaystyle d} is a complete pseudometric on X {\displaystyle X} if and only if X {\displaystyle X} is complete as a TVS.

[ 36 ] Theorem [ 37 ] [ 38 ] (Klee) — Let d {\displaystyle d} be any [ note 2 ] metric on a vector space X {\displaystyle X} such that the topology τ τ {\displaystyle \tau } induced by d {\displaystyle d} on X {\displaystyle X} makes ( X , τ τ ) {\displaystyle (X,\tau )} into a topological vector space. If ( X , d ) {\displaystyle (X,d)} is a complete metric space then ( X , τ τ ) {\displaystyle (X,\tau )} is a complete-TVS.

Theorem — If X {\displaystyle X} is a TVS whose topology is induced by a paranorm p , {\displaystyle p,} then X {\displaystyle X} is complete if and only if for every sequence ( x i ) i = 1 ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \left(x_{i}\right)_{i=1}^{\infty }} in X , {\displaystyle X,} if ∑ ∑ i = 1 ∞ ∞ p ( x i ) < ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \sum _{i=1}^{\infty }p\left(x_{i}\right)<\infty } then ∑ ∑ i = 1 ∞ ∞ x i {\displaystyle \sum _{i=1}^{\infty }x_{i}} converges in X .

{\displaystyle X.} [ 39 ] If M {\displaystyle M} is a closed vector subspace of a complete pseudometrizable TVS X , {\displaystyle X,} then the quotient space X / M {\displaystyle X/M} is complete.

[ 40 ] If M {\displaystyle M} is a complete vector subspace of a metrizable TVS X {\displaystyle X} and if the quotient space X / M {\displaystyle X/M} is complete then so is X .

{\displaystyle X.} [ 40 ] If X {\displaystyle X} is not complete then M := X , {\displaystyle M:=X,} but not complete, vector subspace of X .

{\displaystyle X.} A Baire separable topological group is metrizable if and only if it is cosmic.

[ 23 ] Subsets and subsequences [ edit ] Let M {\displaystyle M} be a separable locally convex metrizable topological vector space and let C {\displaystyle C} be its completion. If S {\displaystyle S} is a bounded subset of C {\displaystyle C} then there exists a bounded subset R {\displaystyle R} of X {\displaystyle X} such that S ⊆ ⊆ cl C ⁡ ⁡ R .

{\displaystyle S\subseteq \operatorname {cl} _{C}R.} [ 41 ] Every totally bounded subset of a locally convex metrizable TVS X {\displaystyle X} is contained in the closed convex balanced hull of some sequence in X {\displaystyle X} that converges to 0.

{\displaystyle 0.} In a pseudometrizable TVS, every bornivore is a neighborhood of the origin.

[ 42 ] If d {\displaystyle d} is a translation invariant metric on a vector space X , {\displaystyle X,} then d ( n x , 0 ) ≤ ≤ n d ( x , 0 ) {\displaystyle d(nx,0)\leq nd(x,0)} for all x ∈ ∈ X {\displaystyle x\in X} and every positive integer n .

{\displaystyle n.} [ 43 ] If ( x i ) i = 1 ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \left(x_{i}\right)_{i=1}^{\infty }} is a null sequence (that is, it converges to the origin) in a metrizable TVS then there exists a sequence ( r i ) i = 1 ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \left(r_{i}\right)_{i=1}^{\infty }} of positive real numbers diverging to ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \infty } such that ( r i x i ) i = 1 ∞ ∞ → → 0.

{\displaystyle \left(r_{i}x_{i}\right)_{i=1}^{\infty }\to 0.} [ 43 ] A subset of a complete metric space is closed if and only if it is complete.  If a space X {\displaystyle X} is not complete, then X {\displaystyle X} is a closed subset of X {\displaystyle X} that is not complete.

If X {\displaystyle X} is a metrizable locally convex TVS then for every bounded subset B {\displaystyle B} of X , {\displaystyle X,} there exists a bounded disk D {\displaystyle D} in X {\displaystyle X} such that B ⊆ ⊆ X D , {\displaystyle B\subseteq X_{D},} and both X {\displaystyle X} and the auxiliary normed space X D {\displaystyle X_{D}} induce the same subspace topology on B .

{\displaystyle B.} [ 44 ] Banach-Saks theorem [ 45 ] — If ( x n ) n = 1 ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \left(x_{n}\right)_{n=1}^{\infty }} is a sequence in a locally convex metrizable TVS ( X , τ τ ) {\displaystyle (X,\tau )} that converges weakly to some x ∈ ∈ X , {\displaystyle x\in X,} then there exists a sequence y ∙ ∙ = ( y i ) i = 1 ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle y_{\bullet }=\left(y_{i}\right)_{i=1}^{\infty }} in X {\displaystyle X} such that y ∙ ∙ → → x {\displaystyle y_{\bullet }\to x} in ( X , τ τ ) {\displaystyle (X,\tau )} and each y i {\displaystyle y_{i}} is a convex combination of finitely many x n .

{\displaystyle x_{n}.} Mackey's countability condition [ 14 ] — Suppose that X {\displaystyle X} is a locally convex metrizable TVS and that ( B i ) i = 1 ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \left(B_{i}\right)_{i=1}^{\infty }} is a countable sequence of bounded subsets of X .

{\displaystyle X.} Then there exists a bounded subset B {\displaystyle B} of X {\displaystyle X} and a sequence ( r i ) i = 1 ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \left(r_{i}\right)_{i=1}^{\infty }} of positive real numbers such that B i ⊆ ⊆ r i B {\displaystyle B_{i}\subseteq r_{i}B} for all i .

{\displaystyle i.} Generalized series As described in this article's section on generalized series , for any I {\displaystyle I} - indexed family family ( r i ) i ∈ ∈ I {\displaystyle \left(r_{i}\right)_{i\in I}} of vectors from a TVS X , {\displaystyle X,} it is possible to define their sum ∑ ∑ i ∈ ∈ I r i {\displaystyle \textstyle \sum \limits _{i\in I}r_{i}} as the limit of the net of finite partial sums F ∈ ∈ FiniteSubsets ⁡ ⁡ ( I ) ↦ ↦ ∑ ∑ i ∈ ∈ F r i {\displaystyle F\in \operatorname {FiniteSubsets} (I)\mapsto \textstyle \sum \limits _{i\in F}r_{i}} where the domain FiniteSubsets ⁡ ⁡ ( I ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {FiniteSubsets} (I)} is directed by ⊆ ⊆ .

{\displaystyle \,\subseteq .\,} If I = N {\displaystyle I=\mathbb {N} } and X = R , {\displaystyle X=\mathbb {R} ,} for instance, then the generalized series ∑ ∑ i ∈ ∈ N r i {\displaystyle \textstyle \sum \limits _{i\in \mathbb {N} }r_{i}} converges if and only if ∑ ∑ i = 1 ∞ ∞ r i {\displaystyle \textstyle \sum \limits _{i=1}^{\infty }r_{i}} converges unconditionally in the usual sense (which for real numbers, is equivalent to absolute convergence ). 
If a generalized series ∑ ∑ i ∈ ∈ I r i {\displaystyle \textstyle \sum \limits _{i\in I}r_{i}} converges in a metrizable TVS, then the set { i ∈ ∈ I : r i ≠ ≠ 0 } {\displaystyle \left\{i\in I:r_{i}\neq 0\right\}} is necessarily countable (that is, either finite or countably infinite ); [ proof 1 ] in other words, all but at most countably many r i {\displaystyle r_{i}} will be zero and so this generalized series ∑ ∑ i ∈ ∈ I r i = ∑ ∑ r i ≠ ≠ 0 i ∈ ∈ I r i {\displaystyle \textstyle \sum \limits _{i\in I}r_{i}~=~\textstyle \sum \limits _{\stackrel {i\in I}{r_{i}\neq 0}}r_{i}} is actually a sum of at most countably many non-zero terms.

Linear maps [ edit ] If X {\displaystyle X} is a pseudometrizable TVS and A {\displaystyle A} maps bounded subsets of X {\displaystyle X} to bounded subsets of Y , {\displaystyle Y,} then A {\displaystyle A} is continuous.

[ 14 ] Discontinuous linear functionals exist on any infinite-dimensional pseudometrizable TVS.

[ 46 ] Thus, a pseudometrizable TVS is finite-dimensional if and only if its continuous dual space is equal to its algebraic dual space .

[ 46 ] If F : X → → Y {\displaystyle F:X\to Y} is a linear map between TVSs and X {\displaystyle X} is metrizable then the following are equivalent: F {\displaystyle F} is continuous; F {\displaystyle F} is a (locally) bounded map (that is, F {\displaystyle F} maps (von Neumann) bounded subsets of X {\displaystyle X} to bounded subsets of Y {\displaystyle Y} ); [ 12 ] F {\displaystyle F} is sequentially continuous ; [ 12 ] the image under F {\displaystyle F} of every null sequence in X {\displaystyle X} is a bounded set [ 12 ] where by definition, a null sequence is a sequence that converges to the origin.

F {\displaystyle F} maps null sequences to null sequences; Open and almost open maps Theorem : If X {\displaystyle X} is a complete pseudometrizable TVS, Y {\displaystyle Y} is a Hausdorff TVS, and T : X → → Y {\displaystyle T:X\to Y} is a closed and almost open linear surjection, then T {\displaystyle T} is an open map.

[ 47 ] Theorem : If T : X → → Y {\displaystyle T:X\to Y} is a surjective linear operator from a locally convex space X {\displaystyle X} onto a barrelled space Y {\displaystyle Y} (e.g. every complete pseudometrizable space is barrelled) then T {\displaystyle T} is almost open .

[ 47 ] Theorem : If T : X → → Y {\displaystyle T:X\to Y} is a surjective linear operator from a TVS X {\displaystyle X} onto a Baire space Y {\displaystyle Y} then T {\displaystyle T} is almost open.

[ 47 ] Theorem : Suppose T : X → → Y {\displaystyle T:X\to Y} is a continuous linear operator from a complete pseudometrizable TVS X {\displaystyle X} into a Hausdorff TVS Y .

{\displaystyle Y.} If the image of T {\displaystyle T} is non- meager in Y {\displaystyle Y} then T : X → → Y {\displaystyle T:X\to Y} is a surjective open map and Y {\displaystyle Y} is a complete metrizable space.

[ 47 ] Hahn-Banach extension property [ edit ] Main article: Hahn-Banach theorem A vector subspace M {\displaystyle M} of a TVS X {\displaystyle X} has the extension property if any continuous linear functional on M {\displaystyle M} can be extended to a continuous linear functional on X .

{\displaystyle X.} [ 22 ] Say that a TVS X {\displaystyle X} has the Hahn-Banach extension property ( HBEP ) if every vector subspace of X {\displaystyle X} has the extension property.

[ 22 ] The Hahn-Banach theorem guarantees that every Hausdorff locally convex space has the HBEP. 
For complete metrizable TVSs there is a converse: Theorem (Kalton) — Every complete metrizable TVS with the Hahn-Banach extension property is locally convex.

[ 22 ] If a vector space X {\displaystyle X} has uncountable dimension and if we endow it with the finest vector topology then this is a TVS with the HBEP that is neither locally convex or metrizable.

^ Not assumed to be translation-invariant.

Proofs ^ Suppose the net ∑ ∑ i ∈ ∈ I r i = def lim A ∈ ∈ FiniteSubsets ⁡ ⁡ ( I ) ∑ ∑ i ∈ ∈ A r i = lim { ∑ ∑ i ∈ ∈ A r i : A ⊆ ⊆ I , A finite } {\textstyle \textstyle \sum \limits _{i\in I}r_{i}~{\stackrel {\scriptscriptstyle {\text{def}}}{=}}~{\textstyle \lim \limits _{A\in \operatorname {FiniteSubsets} (I)}}\ \textstyle \sum \limits _{i\in A}r_{i}=\lim \left\{\textstyle \sum \limits _{i\in A}r_{i}\,:A\subseteq I,A{\text{ finite }}\right\}} converges to some point in a metrizable TVS X , {\displaystyle X,} where recall that this net's domain is the directed set ( FiniteSubsets ⁡ ⁡ ( I ) , ⊆ ⊆ ) .

{\displaystyle (\operatorname {FiniteSubsets} (I),\subseteq ).} Like every convergent net, this convergent net of partial sums A ↦ ↦ ∑ ∑ i ∈ ∈ A r i {\displaystyle A\mapsto \textstyle \sum \limits _{i\in A}r_{i}} is a Cauchy net , which for this particular net means (by definition) that for every neighborhood W {\displaystyle W} of the origin in X , {\displaystyle X,} there exists a finite subset A 0 {\displaystyle A_{0}} of I {\displaystyle I} such that ∑ ∑ i ∈ ∈ B r i − − ∑ ∑ i ∈ ∈ C r i ∈ ∈ W {\textstyle \textstyle \sum \limits _{i\in B}r_{i}-\textstyle \sum \limits _{i\in C}r_{i}\in W} for all finite supersets B , C ⊇ ⊇ A 0 ; {\displaystyle B,C\supseteq A_{0};} this implies that r i ∈ ∈ W {\displaystyle r_{i}\in W} for every i ∈ ∈ I ∖ ∖ A 0 {\displaystyle i\in I\setminus A_{0}} (by taking B := A 0 ∪ ∪ { i } {\displaystyle B:=A_{0}\cup \{i\}} and C := A 0 {\displaystyle C:=A_{0}} ). 
Since X {\displaystyle X} is metrizable, it has a countable neighborhood basis U 1 , U 2 , … … {\displaystyle U_{1},U_{2},\ldots } at the origin, whose intersection is necessarily U 1 ∩ ∩ U 2 ∩ ∩ ⋯ ⋯ = { 0 } {\displaystyle U_{1}\cap U_{2}\cap \cdots =\{0\}} (since X {\displaystyle X} is a Hausdorff TVS).
For every positive integer n ∈ ∈ N , {\displaystyle n\in \mathbb {N} ,} pick a finite subset A n ⊆ ⊆ I {\displaystyle A_{n}\subseteq I} such that r i ∈ ∈ U n {\displaystyle r_{i}\in U_{n}} for every i ∈ ∈ I ∖ ∖ A n .

{\displaystyle i\in I\setminus A_{n}.} If i {\displaystyle i} belongs to ( I ∖ ∖ A 1 ) ∩ ∩ ( I ∖ ∖ A 2 ) ∩ ∩ ⋯ ⋯ = I ∖ ∖ ( A 1 ∪ ∪ A 2 ∪ ∪ ⋯ ⋯ ) {\displaystyle (I\setminus A_{1})\cap (I\setminus A_{2})\cap \cdots =I\setminus \left(A_{1}\cup A_{2}\cup \cdots \right)} then r i {\displaystyle r_{i}} belongs to U 1 ∩ ∩ U 2 ∩ ∩ ⋯ ⋯ = { 0 } .

{\displaystyle U_{1}\cap U_{2}\cap \cdots =\{0\}.} Thus r i = 0 {\displaystyle r_{i}=0} for every index i ∈ ∈ I {\displaystyle i\in I} that does not belong to the countable set A 1 ∪ ∪ A 2 ∪ ∪ ⋯ ⋯ .
