When an observer stands very near to the window at one end of the corridor the tower seems very small, while when they stand on the other end further away from the window the tower appears paradoxically enlarged.

The Vista paradox is a natural optical illusion [ 1 ] where an object seen through an aperture appears to shrink in apparent size as the observer approaches the aperture.

[ 2 ] The paradox takes place when the distant object that seems to be shrinking or enlarging as its visual angle respectively increases or decreases is many times further away than the maximum distance between the observer and the aperture.
