Latitude 41°41 ′ N to 48°18 ′ N Longitude 82°7 ′ W to 90°25 ′ W Website michigan .gov Michigan ( / ˈ m ɪ ʃ ɪ ɡ ən / ⓘ MISH -ig-ən ) is a peninsular state in the Great Lakes region of the Upper Midwestern United States . It shares water and land boundaries with Minnesota to the northwest, Wisconsin to the west, Indiana and Illinois to the southwest, Ohio to the southeast, and the Canadian province of Ontario to the east, northeast and north. With a population of 10.14 million [ 6 ] and an area of 96,716 sq mi (250,490 km 2 ), Michigan is the 10th-largest state by population, the 11th-largest by area, and the largest by total area east of the Mississippi River .

[ b ] The state capital is Lansing , while its most populous city is Detroit . The Metro Detroit region in Southeast Michigan is among the nation's most populous and largest metropolitan economies. Other important metropolitan areas include Grand Rapids , Flint , Ann Arbor , Kalamazoo , the Tri-Cities , and Muskegon .

Michigan consists of two peninsulas: the heavily forested Upper Peninsula (commonly called "the U.P."), which juts eastward from northern Wisconsin, and the more populated Lower Peninsula, stretching north from Ohio and Indiana. The peninsulas are separated by the Straits of Mackinac , which connects Lake Michigan and Lake Huron, and are linked by the 5-mile-long Mackinac Bridge along Interstate 75 . Bordering four of the five Great Lakes and Lake St. Clair , Michigan has the longest freshwater coastline of any U.S. political subdivision, measuring 3,288 miles.

[ 7 ] The state ranks second behind Alaska in water coverage by square miles and first in percentage, with approximately 42%, and it also contains 64,980 inland lakes and ponds .

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] The Great Lakes region has largely been inhabited for thousands of years by Indigenous peoples such as the Ojibwe , Odawa , Potawatomi , and Wyandot .
Some people contend that the region's name is derived from the Ojibwe word ᒥᓯᑲᒥ (mishigami), [ c ] meaning "large water" or "large lake".

[ 1 ] [ 10 ] While others say that it comes from the Mishiiken Tribe of Mackinac Island, also called Michinemackinawgo by Ottawa historian Andrew Blackbird, [ 11 ] whose surrounding lands were referred to as Mishiiken-imakinakom, later shortened to Michilimackinac.

In the 17th century, French explorers claimed the area for New France . French settlers and Métis established forts and settlements.
After France's defeat in the French and Indian War in 1762, the area came under British control and later the U.S. following the Treaty of Paris (1783) , though control remained disputed with Indigenous tribes until treaties between 1795 and 1842. The area was part of the larger Northwest Territory ; the Michigan Territory was organized in 1805.

Michigan was admitted as the 26th state on January 26, 1837, entering as a free state and quickly developing into an industrial and trade hub that attracted European immigrants, particularly from Finland , Macedonia , and the Netherlands .

[ 12 ] In the 1930s, migration from Appalachia and the Middle East and the Great Migration of Black Southerners further shaped the state, especially in Metro Detroit.

[ 13 ] [ 14 ] Michigan has a diversified economy with a gross state product of $725.897 billion as of Q1 2025, ranking 14th among the 50 states.

[ 15 ] Although the state has developed a diverse economy, in the early 20th century it became widely known as the center of the U.S. automotive industry , which developed as a major national economic force. It is home to the country's three major automobile companies (whose headquarters are all in Metro Detroit). Once exploited for logging and mining, today the sparsely populated Upper Peninsula is important for tourism because of its abundance of natural resources.

[ 16 ] [ 17 ] The Lower Peninsula is a center of manufacturing , forestry , agriculture , services , and high-tech industry.

History Main article: History of Michigan For a chronological guide, see Timeline of Michigan history .

When the first European explorers arrived, the most populous tribes were the Algonquian peoples , which include the Anishinaabe groups of Ojibwe , Odaawaa/Odawa (Ottawa) , and the Boodewaadamii/Bodéwadmi (Potawatomi) . The three nations coexisted peacefully as part of a loose confederation called the Council of Three Fires . The Ojibwe, whose numbers are estimated to have been at least 35,000, were the largest.

[ 18 ] The Ojibwe Indians (also known as Chippewa in the U.S.), an Anishinaabe tribe, were established in Michigan's Upper Peninsula and northern and central Michigan . Bands also inhabited Ontario and southern Manitoba , Canada; and northern Wisconsin , and northern and north-central Minnesota . The Ottawa Indians lived primarily south of the Straits of Mackinac in northern, western , and southern Michigan , but also in southern Ontario, northern Ohio, and eastern Wisconsin. The Potawatomi were in southern and western Michigan, in addition to northern and central Indiana, northern Illinois, southern Wisconsin, and southern Ontario. Other Algonquian tribes in Michigan, in the south and east, were the Mascouten , the Menominee , the Miami , the Sac (or Sauk), and the Meskwaki (Fox) . The Wyandot were an Iroquoian-speaking people in this area; they were historically known as the Huron by the French, and were the historical adversaries of the Iroquois Confederation .

[ 19 ] 17th century Main articles: New France and Canada (New France) Territorial changes of the Michigan Territory from 1818 to 1836 Père Marquette and the Indians (1869), by Wilhelm Lamprecht French voyageurs and coureurs des bois explored and settled in Michigan in the 17th century. The first Europeans to reach what became Michigan were those of Étienne Brûlé 's expedition in 1622. The first permanent European settlement was founded in 1668 on the site where Père Jacques Marquette established Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan , as a base for Catholic missions.

[ 20 ] [ 21 ] Missionaries in 1671–75 founded outlying stations at Saint Ignace and Marquette . Jesuit missionaries were well received by the area's Indian populations, with few difficulties or hostilities. In 1679, Robert Cavelier, Sieur de la Salle built Fort Miami at present-day St. Joseph . In 1691, the French established a trading post and Fort St. Joseph along the St. Joseph River at the present-day city of Niles .

18th century Main articles: French and Indian War , Treaty of Paris (1763) , Province of Quebec (1763–1791) , Indian Reserve (1763) , American Revolutionary War , Treaty of Paris (1783) , Northwest Ordinance , and Northwest Territory In 1701, French explorer and army officer Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac founded Fort Pontchartrain du Détroit or "Fort Pontchartrain on-the-Strait" on the strait, known as the Detroit River , between lakes Saint Clair and Erie .

[ citation needed ] Cadillac had convinced King Louis XIV's chief minister, Louis Phélypeaux, Comte de Pontchartrain , that a permanent community there would strengthen French control over the upper Great Lakes and discourage British aspirations.

[ citation needed ] The hundred soldiers and workers who accompanied Cadillac built a fort enclosing one arpent (about 0.85 acres (3,400 m 2 ), [ 22 ] [ 23 ] the equivalent of just under 200 feet (61 m) per side) and named it Fort Pontchartrain . Cadillac's wife, Marie Thérèse Guyon, soon moved to Detroit, becoming one of the first European women to settle in what was considered the wilderness of Michigan. The town quickly became a major fur-trading and shipping post. The Église de Saint-Anne (Catholic Church of Saint Anne) was founded the same year.

[ citation needed ] While the original building does not survive, the congregation remains active.

[ citation needed ] Cadillac later departed to serve as the French governor of Louisiana from 1710 to 1716.

[ citation needed ] French attempts to consolidate the fur trade led to the Fox Wars , in which the Meskwaki (Fox) and their allies fought the French and their Native allies.

[ citation needed ] At the same time, the French strengthened Fort Michilimackinac at the Straits of Mackinac to better control their lucrative fur-trading empire. By the mid-18th century, the French also occupied forts at present-day Niles and Sault Ste. Marie, though most of the rest of the region remained unsettled by Europeans. France offered free land to attract families to Detroit, which grew to 800 people in 1765. It was the largest city between Montreal and New Orleans.

[ 24 ] French settlers also established small farms south of the Detroit River opposite the fort, near a Jesuit mission and Huron village.

Map of British America showing the original boundaries of the Province of Quebec and its Quebec Act of 1774 post-annexation boundaries Treaty of Paris , by Benjamin West (1783), an unfinished painting of the American diplomatic negotiators of the Treaty of Paris which brought official conclusion to the Revolutionary War and gave possession of Michigan and other territory to the new United States From 1660 until the end of French rule, Michigan was part of the Royal Province of New France .

[ d ] In 1760, Montreal fell to the British forces, ending the French and Indian War (1754–1763), the North American front of the Seven Years' War in Europe. Under the 1763 Treaty of Paris , Michigan and the rest of New France east of the Mississippi River were ceded by defeated France to Great Britain.

[ 25 ] After the Quebec Act was passed in 1774, Michigan became part of the British Province of Quebec . By 1778, Detroit's population reached 2,144 and it was the third-largest city in Quebec province.

[ 26 ] During the American Revolutionary War , Detroit was an important British supply center. Most of the inhabitants were French-Canadians or American Indians, many of whom had been allied with the French because of long trading ties. Because of imprecise cartography and unclear language defining the boundaries in the 1783 Treaty of Paris , the British retained control of Detroit and Michigan after the American Revolution . When Quebec split into Lower and Upper Canada in 1791, Michigan was part of Kent County , Upper Canada. It held its first democratic elections in August 1792 to send delegates to the new provincial parliament at Newark (now Niagara-on-the-Lake ).

[ 27 ] Under terms negotiated in the 1794 Jay Treaty , Britain withdrew from Detroit and Michilimackinac in 1796. It retained control of territory east and south of the Detroit River, which are now included in Ontario, Canada. Questions remained over the boundary for many years, and the United States did not have uncontested control of the Upper Peninsula and Drummond Island until 1818 and 1847, respectively.

19th century Main articles: Indiana Territory , Organic act § List of organic acts , Michigan Territory , Admission to the Union , List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union , and Michigan in the American Civil War During the War of 1812 , the United States forces at Fort Detroit surrendered Michigan Territory (effectively consisting of Detroit and the surrounding area) after a nearly bloodless siege in 1812. A U.S. attempt to retake Detroit resulted in a severe American defeat in the River Raisin Massacre . This battle, still ranked as the bloodiest ever fought in the state, had the highest number of American casualties of any battle of the war.

Michigan was recaptured by the Americans in 1813 after the Battle of Lake Erie . They used Michigan as a base to launch an invasion of Canada, which culminated in the Battle of the Thames . But the more northern areas of Michigan were held by the British until the peace treaty restored the old boundaries. A number of forts, including Fort Wayne , were built by the United States in Michigan during the 19th century out of fears of renewed fighting with Britain.

Walk-in-the-Water steamboat at Detroit, 1820 Michigan Territory governor and judges established the University of Michigan in 1817, as the Catholepistemiad, or the University of Michigania.

[ 28 ] The population grew slowly until the opening in 1825 of the Erie Canal through the Mohawk Valley in New York, connecting the Great Lakes to the Hudson River and New York City.

[ 29 ] The new route attracted a large influx of settlers to the Michigan territory. They worked as farmers, lumbermen, shipbuilders, and merchants and shipped out grain, lumber, and iron ore. By the 1830s, Michigan had 30,000 residents, more than enough to apply and qualify for statehood.

[ 30 ] On November 1, 1935, the U.S. Post Office issued a commemorative 3-cent stamp celebrating the 100th anniversary of Michigan statehood. Michigan's statehood, however, wasn't officially established until January 26, 1837, but since the campaign for statehood actually began in 1835, Michigan chose to hold its centennial celebration in 1935, the year the stamp was first issued.

[ 31 ] A constitutional convention of assent was held to lead the territory to statehood.

[ 32 ] In October 1835 the people approved the constitution of 1835, thereby forming a state government.

Congressional recognition was delayed pending resolution of a boundary dispute with Ohio known as the Toledo War . Congress awarded the "Toledo Strip" to Ohio. Michigan received the western part of the Upper Peninsula as a concession and formally entered the Union as a free state on January 26, 1837. The Upper Peninsula proved to be a rich source of lumber, iron, and copper. Michigan led the nation in lumber production from the 1850s to the 1880s.

Railroads became a major engine of growth from the 1850s onward, with Detroit the chief hub .

The 21st Michigan Infantry , a company of William Tecumseh Sherman 's veterans A second wave of French-Canadian immigrants settled in Michigan during the late 19th to early 20th century, working in lumbering areas in counties on the Lake Huron side of the Lower Peninsula, such as the Saginaw Valley, Alpena, and Cheboygan counties, as well as throughout the Upper Peninsula, with large concentrations in Escanaba and the Keweenaw Peninsula .

[ 33 ] The first statewide meeting of the Republican Party took place on July 6, 1854, in Jackson, Michigan , where the party adopted its platform.

[ 34 ] [ 35 ] The state was predominantly Republican until the 1930s, reflecting the political continuity of migrants from across the Northern Tier of New England and New York.

[ citation needed ] Michigan made a significant contribution to the Union in the American Civil War and sent more than forty regiments of volunteers to the federal armies.

[ citation needed ] Michigan modernized and expanded its system of education in this period.

[ citation needed ] The Michigan State Normal School, now Eastern Michigan University , was founded in 1849, for the training of teachers.

[ 36 ] It was the fourth oldest normal school in the United States and the first U.S. normal school outside New England .

[ citation needed ] In 1899, the Michigan State Normal School became the first normal school in the nation to offer a four-year curriculum. Michigan Agricultural College (1855), now Michigan State University in East Lansing , was founded as the first agricultural college in the nation.

[ citation needed ] Many private colleges were founded as well, and the smaller cities established high schools late in the century.

[ 37 ] 20th–21st centuries Miners at the Tamarack mine in Copper Country , in 1905 Detroit in the mid-twentieth century. At the time, the city was the fourth-largest U.S. metropolis by population, and held about one-third of the state's population.

Michigan's economy underwent a transformation at the turn of the 20th century. Many individuals, including Ransom E. Olds , John and Horace Dodge , Henry Leland , David Dunbar Buick , Henry Joy , Charles King , and Henry Ford , provided the concentration of engineering know-how and technological enthusiasm to develop the automotive industry .

[ 38 ] Ford's development of the moving assembly line in Highland Park marked a new era in transportation.

[ citation needed ] Like the steamship and railroad, mass production of automobiles was a far-reaching development. More than the forms of public transportation, the affordable automobile transformed private life. Automobile production became the major industry of Detroit and Michigan, and permanently altered the socioeconomic life of the United States and much of the world.

[ citation needed ] With the growth, the auto industry created jobs in Detroit that attracted immigrants from Europe and migrants from across the United States, including both blacks and whites from the rural South .

[ citation needed ] By 1920, Detroit was the fourth-largest city in the U.S..

[ citation needed ] Residential housing was in short supply, and it took years for the market to catch up with the population boom.

[ citation needed ] By the 1930s, so many immigrants had arrived that more than 30 languages were spoken in the public schools, and ethnic communities celebrated in annual heritage festivals.

[ 39 ] Over the years immigrants and migrants contributed greatly to Detroit's diverse urban culture, including popular music trends. The influential Motown Sound of the 1960s was led by a variety of individual singers and groups.

[ citation needed ] Grand Rapids , the second-largest city in Michigan, also became an important center of manufacturing. Since 1838, the city has been noted for its furniture industry.

[ 40 ] [ 41 ] In the 21st century, it is home to five of the world's leading office furniture companies. Grand Rapids is home to a number of major companies including Steelcase , Amway , and Meijer . Grand Rapids is also an important center for GE Aviation Systems .

Michigan held its first United States presidential primary election in 1910.

[ citation needed ] With its rapid growth in industry, it was an important center of industry-wide union organizing, such as the rise of the United Auto Workers .

[ citation needed ] In 1920 WWJ (AM) in Detroit became the first radio station in the United States to regularly broadcast commercial programs. Throughout that decade, some of the country's largest and most ornate skyscrapers were built in the city. Particularly noteworthy are the Fisher Building , Cadillac Place , and the Guardian Building , each of which has been designated as a National Historic Landmark (NHL).

Commemorative stamp, issue of 1935, celebrating the 100th anniversary of Michigan statehood.

[ 31 ] In 1927 a school bombing took place in Clinton County . The Bath School disaster resulted in the deaths of 38 schoolchildren and constitutes the deadliest mass murder in a school in U.S. history.

[ 42 ] Michigan converted much of its manufacturing to satisfy defense needs during World War II ; it manufactured 10.9% of the United States military armaments produced during the war, ranking second (behind New York ) among the 48 states.

[ 43 ] Detroit continued to expand through the 1950s, at one point doubling its population in a decade. After World War II, housing was developed in suburban areas outside city cores to meet demand for residences. The federal government subsidized the construction of interstate highways , which were intended to strengthen military access, but also allowed commuters and business traffic to travel the region more easily. Since 1960, modern advances in the auto industry have led to increased automation, high-tech industry, and increased suburban growth. Longstanding tensions in Detroit culminated in the Twelfth Street riot in July 1967.

During the late 1970s and the early 1980s, increasing fuel costs and other factors made significantly more global competition and recession among families. Michigan lost a significant amount of population due to global competition and the dramatic unavailability of manufacturing jobs.

[ 44 ] Meanwhile, Michigan had increased use of technology, specifically when the IBM Personal Computer started selling in the state, in which became mostly used at work.

Michigan became the leading auto-producing state in the U.S., with the industry primarily located throughout the Midwestern United States ; Ontario, Canada; and the Southern United States.

[ 45 ] With almost ten million residents in 2010, Michigan is a large and influential state, ranking tenth in population among the fifty states. Detroit is the centrally located metropolitan area of the Great Lakes megalopolis and the second-largest metropolitan area in the U.S. (after Chicago ) linking the Great Lakes system.

The Metro Detroit area in Southeast Michigan is the state's largest metropolitan area (roughly 50% of the population resides there) and the eleventh largest in the United States. The Grand Rapids metropolitan area in Western Michigan is the state's fastest-growing metro area, with more than 1.3 million residents as of 2006 [update] .

Geography Further information: Geography of Michigan , Protected areas of Michigan , and List of Michigan state parks Map of the Saint Lawrence River/Great Lakes Watershed in North America. Its drainage area includes the Great Lakes , the world's largest system of freshwater lakes. The basin covers nearly all of Michigan.

The Huron National Wildlife Refuge , one of the fifteen federal wildernesses in Michigan Michigan consists of two peninsulas separated by the Straits of Mackinac . The 45th parallel north runs through the state, marked by highway signs and the Polar-Equator Trail— [ 46 ] along a line including Mission Point Light near Traverse City , the towns of Gaylord and Alpena in the Lower Peninsula and Menominee in the Upper Peninsula. With the exception of two tiny areas drained by the Mississippi River by way of the Wisconsin River in the Upper Peninsula and by way of the Kankakee - Illinois River in the Lower Peninsula, Michigan is drained by the Great Lakes- St. Lawrence watershed and is the only state with the majority of its land thus drained. No point in the state is more than six miles (9.7 km) from a natural water source or more than 85 miles (137 km) from a Great Lakes shoreline.

[ 47 ] The Great Lakes that border Michigan from east to west are Lake Erie , Lake Huron , Lake Michigan and Lake Superior . The state is bounded on the south by the states of Ohio and Indiana , sharing land and water boundaries with both. Michigan's western boundaries are almost entirely water boundaries, from south to north, with Illinois and Wisconsin in Lake Michigan; then a land boundary with Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula, that is principally demarcated by the Menominee and Montreal Rivers ; then water boundaries again, in Lake Superior, with Wisconsin and Minnesota to the west, capped around by the Canadian province of Ontario to the north and east.

The heavily forested Upper Peninsula is relatively mountainous in the west. The Porcupine Mountains , which are part of one of the oldest mountain chains in the world, [ 48 ] rise to an altitude of almost 2,000 feet (610 m) above sea level and form the watershed between the streams flowing into Lake Superior and Lake Michigan. The surface on either side of this range is rugged. The state's highest point, in the Huron Mountains northwest of Marquette, is Mount Arvon at 1,979 feet (603 m). The peninsula is as large as Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island combined but has fewer than 330,000 inhabitants. The people are sometimes called "Yoopers" (from "U.P.'ers"), and their speech (the " Yooper dialect ") has been heavily influenced by the numerous Scandinavian and Canadian immigrants who settled the area during the lumbering and mining boom of the late 19th century.

Mackinac Island , an island and resort area at the eastern end of the Straits of Mackinac . More than 80% of the island is preserved as Mackinac Island State Park .

Sleeping Bear Dunes , along the northwest coast of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan The Tahquamenon Falls in the Upper Peninsula The Pointe Mouillee State Game Area , one of the 221 state game and wildlife areas in Michigan. It encompasses 7,483 acres of hunting, recreational, and protected wildlife and wetland areas at the mouth of the Huron River at Lake Erie , as well as smaller outlying areas within the Detroit River .

The Lower Peninsula is shaped like a mitten and many residents hold up a hand to depict where they are from.

[ 49 ] It is 277 miles (446 km) long from north to south and 195 miles (314 km) from east to west and occupies nearly two-thirds of the state's land area. The surface of the peninsula is generally level, broken by conical hills and glacial moraines usually not more than a few hundred feet tall. It is divided by a low water divide running north and south. The larger portion of the state is on the west of this and gradually slopes toward Lake Michigan. The highest point in the Lower Peninsula is either Briar Hill at 1,705 feet (520 m), or one of several points nearby in the vicinity of Cadillac . The lowest point is the surface of Lake Erie at 571 feet (174 m).

The geographic orientation of Michigan's peninsulas makes for a long distance between the ends of the state.

Ironwood , in the far western Upper Peninsula, lies 630 miles (1,010 kilometers) by highway from Lambertville in the Lower Peninsula's southeastern corner. The geographic isolation of the Upper Peninsula from Michigan's political and population centers makes the region culturally and economically distinct. Frequent attempts to establish the Upper Peninsula as its own state have failed to gain traction.

[ 50 ] [ 51 ] A feature of Michigan that gives it the distinct shape of a mitten is the Thumb , which projects into Lake Huron, forming Saginaw Bay . Other notable peninsulas of Michigan include the Keweenaw Peninsula , which projects northeasterly into Lake Superior from the Upper Peninsula and largely comprising Michigan's Copper Country region, and the Leelanau Peninsula , projecting from the Lower Peninsula into Lake Michigan, forming Michigan's "little finger".

Numerous lakes and marshes mark both peninsulas, and the coast is much indented. Keweenaw Bay, Whitefish Bay , and the Big and Little Bays De Noc are the principal indentations on the Upper Peninsula. The Grand and Little Traverse , Thunder , and Saginaw bays indent the Lower Peninsula. Michigan has the second longest shoreline of any state—3,288 miles (5,292 km), [ 52 ] including 1,056 miles (1,699 km) of island shoreline.

[ 53 ] The state has numerous large islands , the principal ones being the North Manitou and South Manitou , Beaver , and Fox groups in Lake Michigan; Isle Royale and Grande Isle in Lake Superior; Marquette, Bois Blanc , and Mackinac islands in Lake Huron; and Neebish , Sugar , and Drummond islands in St. Mary's River . Michigan has about 150 lighthouses , the most of any U.S. state.

[ 54 ] The first lighthouses in Michigan were built between 1818 and 1822. They were built to project light at night and to serve as a landmark during the day to safely guide the passenger ships and freighters traveling the Great Lakes (see: lighthouses in the United States ).

The state's rivers are generally small, short and shallow, and few are navigable. The principal ones include the Detroit River, St. Marys River, and St. Clair River which connect the Great Lakes; the Au Sable , Cheboygan , and Saginaw , which flow into Lake Huron; the Ontonagon , and Tahquamenon , which flow into Lake Superior; and the St. Joseph , Kalamazoo , Grand , Muskegon , Manistee , and Escanaba , which flow into Lake Michigan. The state has 11,037 inland lakes—totaling 1,305 square miles (3,380 km 2 ) of inland water—in addition to 38,575 square miles (99,910 km 2 ) of Great Lakes waters. No point in Michigan is more than six miles (9.7 km) from an inland lake or more than 85 miles (137 km) from one of the Great Lakes.

[ 55 ] The state is home to several areas maintained by the National Park Service including: Isle Royale National Park , in Lake Superior, about 30 miles (48 km) southeast of Thunder Bay, Ontario. Other national protected areas in the state include: Keweenaw National Historical Park , Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore , Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore , Huron National Forest , Manistee National Forest , Hiawatha National Forest , Ottawa National Forest and Father Marquette National Memorial . The largest section of the North Country National Scenic Trail passes through Michigan.

With 78 state parks , 19 state recreation areas, and six state forests , Michigan has the largest state park and state forest system of any state.

Climate See also: Climate change in Michigan and List of Michigan tornadoes Köppen climate types of Michigan, using 1991–2020 climate normals Michigan has a continental climate with two distinct regions. The southern and central parts of the Lower Peninsula (south of Saginaw Bay and from the Grand Rapids area southward) have a warmer climate ( Köppen climate classification Dfa ) with hot summers and cold winters. The northern part of the Lower Peninsula and the entire Upper Peninsula has a more severe climate (Köppen Dfb ), with warm, but shorter summers and longer, cold to very cold winters. Some parts of the state average high temperatures below freezing from December through February, and into early March in the far northern parts. During the winter through the middle of February, the state is frequently subjected to heavy lake-effect snow . The state averages from 30 to 40 inches (76 to 102 cm) of precipitation annually; however, some areas in the northern lower peninsula and the upper peninsula average almost 160 inches (4,100 mm) of snowfall per year.

[ 56 ] Michigan's highest recorded temperature is 112 °F (44 °C) at Mio on July 13, 1936, and the coldest recorded temperature is −51 °F (−46 °C) at Vanderbilt on February 9, 1934.

[ 57 ] The state averages 30 days of thunderstorm activity per year. These can be severe, especially in the southern part of the state. The state averages 17 tornadoes per year, which are more common in the state's extreme southern section. Portions of the southern border have been almost as vulnerable historically as states further west and in Tornado Alley . For this reason, many communities in the very southern portions of the state have tornado sirens to warn residents of approaching tornadoes. Farther north, in Central Michigan, Northern Michigan, and the Upper Peninsula, tornadoes are rare.

[ 58 ] [ 59 ] Geology The geological formation of the state is greatly varied, with the Michigan Basin being the most major formation. Primary boulders are found over the entire surface of the Upper Peninsula (being principally of primitive origin), while Secondary deposits cover the entire Lower Peninsula. The Upper Peninsula exhibits Lower Silurian sandstones, limestones, copper and iron bearing rocks, corresponding to the Huronian system of Canada . The central portion of the Lower Peninsula contains coal measures and rocks of the Pennsylvanian period.

Devonian and sub-Carboniferous deposits are scattered over the entire state.

Michigan rarely experiences earthquakes , and those that it does experience are generally smaller ones that do not cause significant damage. A 4.6-magnitude earthquake struck in August 1947. More recently, a 4.2-magnitude earthquake occurred on Saturday, May 2, 2015, shortly after noon, about five miles south of Galesburg, Michigan (9 miles southeast of Kalamazoo ) in central Michigan, about 140 miles west of Detroit, according to the Colorado-based U.S. Geological Survey 's National Earthquake Information Center . No major damage or injuries were reported, according to then-Governor Rick Snyder 's office.

[ 60 ] Administrative divisions Main article: Administrative divisions of Michigan See also: List of counties in Michigan , List of municipalities in Michigan , and List of Michigan metropolitan areas Michigan Municipalities State government is decentralized among three tiers—statewide, county and township . Counties are administrative divisions of the state, and townships are administrative divisions of a county. Both of them exercise state government authority, localized to meet the particular needs of their jurisdictions, as provided by state law. There are 83 counties in Michigan .

[ 61 ] Cities, state universities , and villages are vested with home rule powers of varying degrees. Home rule cities can generally do anything not prohibited by law. The fifteen state universities have broad power and can do anything within the parameters of their status as educational institutions that is not prohibited by the state constitution. Villages, by contrast, have limited home rule and are not completely autonomous from the county and township in which they are located.

There are two types of township in Michigan: general law township and charter .

Charter township status was created by the Legislature in 1947 and grants additional powers and stream-lined administration in order to provide greater protection against annexation by a city. As of April 2001 [update] , there were 127 charter townships in Michigan. In general, charter townships have many of the same powers as a city but without the same level of obligations. For example, a charter township can have its own fire department, water and sewer department, police department, and so on—just like a city—but it is not required to have those things, whereas cities must provide those services. Charter townships can opt to use county-wide services instead, such as deputies from the county sheriff's office instead of a home-based force of ordinance officers.

[ 75 ] Black and African Americans —coming to Detroit and other northern cities in the Great Migration of the early 20th century—have formed a majority of the population in Detroit and other cities including Flint and Benton Harbor . Since the 2021 census estimates—while Detroit was still the largest city in Michigan with a majority black population—it was no longer the largest black-majority city in the U.S., citing crime and higher-paying jobs given to whites.

[ 76 ] [ 77 ] As of 2007 [update] , about 300,000 people in Southeastern Michigan trace their descent from the Middle East and Asia.

[ 78 ] Dearborn has a sizeable Arab American community, with many Assyrians , and Lebanese who immigrated for jobs in the auto industry in the 1920s, along with more recent Yemenis and Iraqis .

[ 81 ] By 2015, the number of Hmong in the Detroit city limits had significantly declined.

[ 82 ] Lansing hosts a statewide Hmong New Year Festival.

[ 81 ] The Hmong community also had a prominent portrayal in the 2008 film Gran Torino , which was set in Detroit.

[ 86 ] Religion Religious self-identification, per Public Religion Research Institute 's 2021 American Values Survey [ 87 ] Protestantism (43.0%) Catholicism (24.0%) Jehovah's Witness (1.00%) Unaffiliated (28.0%) Judaism (1.00%) Islam (1.00%) Other (2.00%) Following British and French colonization of the region surrounding Michigan, Christianity became the dominant religion, with Roman Catholicism historically being the largest single Christian group for the state. Until the 19th century, the Roman Catholic Church was the only organized religious group in Michigan, reflecting the territory's French colonial roots. Detroit's St. Anne's parish, established in 1701 by Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac, is the second-oldest Roman Catholic parish in the United States.

[ 88 ] On March 8, 1833, the Holy See formally established a diocese in the Michigan territory, which included all of Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and the Dakotas east of the Mississippi River.

The Christian Reformed Church in North America had almost 100,000 members and more than 230 congregations in Michigan.

[ 95 ] The Reformed Church in America had 76,000 members and 154 congregations in the state.

[ 96 ] By the 2020 study, non- and inter-denominational Protestant churches formed the largest Protestant group in Michigan, numbering 508,904. The Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod grew to become the second-largest single Christian denomination, and United Methodists declined to being the third-largest. The Lutheran Protestant tradition was introduced by German and Scandinavian immigrants. Altogether, Baptists numbered 321,581 between the National Missionary Baptists , National Baptists , American Baptists , Southern Baptists , National Baptists of America , Progressive National Baptists , and Full Gospel Baptists ; black Baptists formed the largest constituency.

[ 90 ] In West Michigan, Dutch immigrants fled from the specter of religious persecution and famine in the Netherlands around 1850 and settled in and around what is now Holland, Michigan, establishing a "colony" on American soil that fervently held onto Calvinist doctrine that established a significant presence of Reformed churches.

[ 97 ] In the same 2010 survey, Jewish adherents in the state of Michigan were estimated at 44,382, and Muslims at 120,351.

Government See also: List of Governors of Michigan and United States congressional delegations from Michigan State government Main article: Government of Michigan The Michigan State Capitol in Lansing houses the legislative branch of the government of the US state of Michigan.

Michigan is governed as a republic, with three branches of government : the executive branch consisting of the Governor of Michigan and the other independently elected constitutional officers; the legislative branch consisting of the House of Representatives and Senate ; and the judicial branch . The Michigan Constitution allows for the direct participation of the electorate by statutory initiative and referendum , recall , and constitutional initiative and referral (Article II, § 9, [ 188 ] defined as "the power to propose laws and to enact and reject laws, called the initiative, and the power to approve or reject laws enacted by the legislature, called the referendum. The power of initiative extends only to laws which the legislature may enact under this constitution").

Lansing is the state capital and is home to all three branches of state government.

The floor of the Michigan House of Representatives The governor and the other state constitutional officers serve four-year terms and may be re-elected only once. The current governor is Gretchen Whitmer . Michigan has two official Governor's Residences ; one is in Lansing, and the other is on Mackinac Island . The other constitutionally elected executive officers are the lieutenant governor , who is elected on a joint ticket with the governor; the secretary of state ; and the attorney general . The lieutenant governor presides over the Senate (voting only in case of a tie) and is also a member of the cabinet. The secretary of state is the chief elections officer and is charged with running many licensure programs including motor vehicles, all of which are done through the branch offices of the secretary of state.

The Michigan Legislature consists of a 38-member Senate and 110-member House of Representatives. Members of both houses of the legislature are elected through first past the post elections by single-member electoral districts of near-equal population that often have boundaries which coincide with county and municipal lines. Senators serve four-year terms concurrent to those of the governor, while representatives serve two-year terms. The Michigan State Capitol was dedicated in 1879 and has hosted the executive and legislative branches of the state ever since.

Governor Gretchen Whitmer speaking at a National Guard ceremony in 2019 The Michigan judiciary consists of two courts with primary jurisdiction (the Circuit Courts and the District Courts), one intermediate level appellate court (the Michigan Court of Appeals ), and the Michigan Supreme Court . There are several administrative courts and specialized courts. District courts are trial courts of limited jurisdiction , handling most traffic violations, small claims, misdemeanors , and civil suits where the amount contended is below $25,000. District courts are often responsible for handling the preliminary examination and for setting bail in felony cases. District court judges are elected to terms of six years. In a few locations, municipal courts have been retained to the exclusion of the establishment of district courts. There are 57 circuit courts in the State of Michigan, which have original jurisdiction over all civil suits where the amount contended in the case exceeds $25,000 and all criminal cases involving felonies . Circuit courts are also the only trial courts in the State of Michigan which possess the power to issue equitable remedies . Circuit courts have appellate jurisdiction from district and municipal courts, as well as from decisions and decrees of state agencies. Most counties have their own circuit court, but sparsely populated counties often share them. Circuit court judges are elected to terms of six years. State appellate court judges are elected to terms of six years, but vacancies are filled by an appointment by the governor. There are four divisions of the Court of Appeals in Detroit, Grand Rapids, Lansing, and Marquette. Cases are heard by the Court of Appeals by panels of three judges, who examine the application of the law and not the facts of the case unless there has been grievous error pertaining to questions of fact. The Michigan Supreme Court consists of seven members who are elected on non-partisan ballots for staggered eight-year terms. The Supreme Court has original jurisdiction only in narrow circumstances but holds appellate jurisdiction over the entire state judicial system.

Law Main article: Law of Michigan Michigan Supreme Court at the Hall of Justice Michigan has had four constitutions, the first of which was ratified on October 5 and 6, 1835.

[ 189 ] There were also constitutions from 1850 and 1908, in addition to the current constitution from 1963. The current document has a preamble, 11 articles, and one section consisting of a schedule and temporary provisions. The current constitution also includes a provision beginning in the general election held in 1978, and every 16 years thereafter, the question of a general revision of the constitution shall be submitted to the electors of the state, next scheduled to be considered November 2026.

[ 190 ] [ 191 ] Michigan, like every U.S. state except Louisiana , has a common law legal system.

Politics Main article: Politics of Michigan 2024 U.S. presidential election results by county in Michigan Democratic Republican Having been a Democratic -leaning state at the presidential level since the 1990s, Michigan has evolved into a swing state after Donald Trump won the state in 2016 . He then won it again in 2024 , after losing it by a slim 2.8% to Democrat Joe Biden in 2020 . Governors since the 1970s have alternated between the Democrats and Republicans , and statewide offices including attorney general , secretary of state , and senator have been held by members of both parties in varying proportion. Additionally, from 1994 until 2022 , the governor-elect had always come from the party opposite the presidency. Following the 2024 elections , control of Michigan Legislature is split, with the Democratic Party having a slim majority of two seats in the Senate while the Republican Party holds a 58-seat majority in the House. The state's congressional delegation is commonly split, with one party or the other typically holding a narrow majority; as of 2025 Republicans have a 7–6 majority.

[ 197 ] State symbols and nicknames Dwarf lake iris Michigan is traditionally known as "The Wolverine State", and the University of Michigan uses the wolverine as its mascot. The association is well and long established: for example, many Detroiters volunteered to fight during the American Civil War and George Armstrong Custer , who led the Michigan Brigade, called them the "Wolverines". The origins of this association are obscure; it may derive from a busy trade in wolverine furs in Sault Ste. Marie in the 18th century or may recall a disparagement intended to compare early settlers in Michigan with the vicious mammal. Wolverines are, however, extremely rare in Michigan. A sighting in February 2004 near Ubly was the first confirmed sighting in Michigan in 200 years.

[ 198 ] Another wolverine was found dead in 2010.

[ 199 ] State nicknames : Wolverine State , Great Lakes State , Mitten State , Water-Winter Wonderland State motto : Si quaeris peninsulam amoenam circumspice (Latin: "If you seek a pleasant peninsula, look about you") adopted in 1835 on the coat-of-arms, but never as an official motto.

It is composed of fossilized coral ( Hexagonaria pericarnata ) from long ago when the middle of the continent was covered with a shallow sea.

State gem : Isle Royale greenstone (since 1973). Also called chlorastrolite (literally "green star stone"), the mineral is found on Isle Royale and the Keweenaw peninsula.

State quarter : US coin issued in 2004 with the Michigan motto "Great Lakes State".
