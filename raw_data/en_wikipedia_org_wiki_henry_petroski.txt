A professor both of civil engineering and history at Duke University , he was also a prolific author. Petroski wrote over a dozen books – beginning with To Engineer is Human: The Role of Failure in Successful Design (1985) and including a number of titles detailing the industrial design history of common, everyday objects, such as pencils , paper clips , toothpicks , and silverware . His first book was made into the film When Engineering Fails .

[ 1 ] He was a frequent lecturer and a columnist for the magazines American Scientist and Prism .

Life and education [ edit ] Petroski was born in Brooklyn , New York, and was raised in Park Slope and Cambria Heights, Queens .
