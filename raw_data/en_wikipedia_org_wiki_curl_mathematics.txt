Depiction of a two-dimensional vector field with a uniform curl.

In [vector calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_calculus "Vector calculus"), the **curl**, also known as **rotor**, is a [vector operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_operator "Vector operator") that describes the [infinitesimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_(infinitesimal) "Differential (infinitesimal)")[circulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulation_(physics) "Circulation (physics)") of a [vector field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_field "Vector field") in three-dimensional [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space"). The curl at a point in the field is represented by a [vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(geometry) "Vector (geometry)") whose length and direction denote the [magnitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnitude_(mathematics) "Magnitude (mathematics)") and axis of the maximum circulation.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curl_(mathematics)#cite_note-Mathworld-1) The curl of a field is formally defined as the circulation density at each point of the field.

A vector field whose curl is zero is called [irrotational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrotational "Irrotational"). The curl is a form of [differentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative "Derivative") for vector fields. The corresponding form of the [fundamental theorem of calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_calculus "Fundamental theorem of calculus") is [Stokes' theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin%E2%80%93Stokes_theorem "Kelvin–Stokes theorem"), which relates the [surface integral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_integral "Surface integral") of the curl of a vector field to the [line integral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_integral "Line integral") of the vector field around the boundary curve.

The notation curl **F** is more common in North America. In the rest of the world, particularly in 20th century scientific literature, the alternative notation rot **F** is traditionally used, which comes from the "rate of rotation" that it represents. To avoid confusion, modern authors tend to use the [cross product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_product "Cross product") notation with the [del](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Del_operator "Del operator") (nabla) operator, as in ![Image 2: {\displaystyle \nabla \times \mathbf {F} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c6e2429b7e3cb6965d1a6651703ff5ef0c88b378),[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curl_(mathematics)#cite_note-2) which also reveals the relation between curl (rotor), [divergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergence "Divergence"), and [gradient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient "Gradient") operators.

Unlike the [gradient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient "Gradient") and [divergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergence "Divergence"), curl as formulated in vector calculus does not generalize simply to other dimensions; some [generalizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curl_(mathematics)#Generalizations) are possible, but only in three dimensions is the geometrically defined curl of a vector field again a vector field. This deficiency is a direct consequence of the limitations of vector calculus; on the other hand, when expressed as an antisymmetric tensor field via the wedge operator of [geometric calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_calculus "Geometric calculus"), the curl generalizes to all dimensions. The circumstance is similar to that attending the 3-dimensional [cross product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_product "Cross product"), and indeed the connection is reflected in the notation ![Image 3: {\displaystyle \nabla \times }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8255aabfb5dba42ab97b2bf70d0dd19a9849a5eb) for the curl.

The name "curl" was first suggested by [James Clerk Maxwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell "James Clerk Maxwell") in 1871[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curl_(mathematics)#cite_note-3) but the concept was apparently first used in the construction of an optical field theory by [James MacCullagh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_MacCullagh "James MacCullagh") in 1839.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curl_(mathematics)#cite_note-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curl_(mathematics)#cite_note-5)

The thumb points in the direction of ![Image 8: {\displaystyle \mathbf {\hat {n}} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4eb84e133d15551d660800ec29b44783ff36e19d) and the fingers curl along the orientation of _C_

The curl of a vector field **F**, denoted by curl **F**, or ![Image 9: {\displaystyle \nabla \times \mathbf {F} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c6e2429b7e3cb6965d1a6651703ff5ef0c88b378), or rot **F**, is an operator that maps [_C k_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_function "Smooth function") functions in **R**3 to _C_ _k_−1 functions in **R**3, and in particular, it maps continuously differentiable functions **R**3 → **R**3 to continuous functions **R**3 → **R**3. It can be defined in several ways, to be mentioned below:

One way to define the curl of a vector field at a point is implicitly through its components along various axes passing through the point: if ![Image 10: {\displaystyle \mathbf {\hat {u}} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1adccb18b3b18c193af9f9ca2b0c0c500103e3ea) is any unit vector, the component of the curl of **F** along the direction ![Image 11: {\displaystyle \mathbf {\hat {u}} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1adccb18b3b18c193af9f9ca2b0c0c500103e3ea) may be defined to be the limiting value of a closed [line integral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_integral "Line integral") in a plane perpendicular to ![Image 12: {\displaystyle \mathbf {\hat {u}} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1adccb18b3b18c193af9f9ca2b0c0c500103e3ea) divided by the area enclosed, as the path of integration is contracted indefinitely around the point.

More specifically, the curl is defined at a point _p_ as[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curl_(mathematics)#cite_note-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curl_(mathematics)#cite_note-7)![Image 13: {\displaystyle (\nabla \times \mathbf {F} )(p)\cdot \mathbf {\hat {u}} \ {\overset {\underset {\mathrm {def} }{}}{{}={}}}\lim _{A\to 0}{\frac {1}{|A|}}\oint _{C(p)}\mathbf {F} \cdot \mathrm {d} \mathbf {r} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4e2775234c9c53554f869d1a24413d64ab6207cb) where the [line integral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_integral "Line integral") is calculated along the [boundary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(topology) "Boundary (topology)")_C_ of the [area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area "Area")_A_ containing point p, |_A_| being the magnitude of the area. This equation defines the component of the curl of **F** along the direction ![Image 14: {\displaystyle \mathbf {\hat {u}} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1adccb18b3b18c193af9f9ca2b0c0c500103e3ea). The infinitesimal surfaces bounded by _C_ have ![Image 15: {\displaystyle \mathbf {\hat {u}} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1adccb18b3b18c193af9f9ca2b0c0c500103e3ea) as their [normal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_vector "Normal vector"). _C_ is oriented via the [right-hand rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-hand_rule "Right-hand rule").

The above formula means that the component of the curl of a vector field along a certain axis is the _infinitesimal [area density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area\_density "Area density")_ of the circulation of the field in a plane perpendicular to that axis. This formula does not _a priori_ define a legitimate vector field, for the individual circulation densities with respect to various axes _a priori_ need not relate to each other in the same way as the components of a vector do; that they _do_ indeed relate to each other in this precise manner must be proven separately.

To this definition fits naturally the [Kelvin–Stokes theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin%E2%80%93Stokes_theorem "Kelvin–Stokes theorem"), as a global formula corresponding to the definition. It equates the [surface integral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_integral "Surface integral") of the curl of a vector field to the above line integral taken around the boundary of the surface.

Another way one can define the curl vector of a function **F** at a point is explicitly as the limiting value of a vector-valued surface integral around a shell enclosing _p_ divided by the volume enclosed, as the shell is contracted indefinitely around _p_.

More specifically, the curl may be defined by the vector formula ![Image 16: {\displaystyle (\nabla \times \mathbf {F} )(p){\overset {\underset {\mathrm {def} }{}}{{}={}}}\lim _{V\to 0}{\frac {1}{|V|}}\oint _{S}\mathbf {\hat {n}} \times \mathbf {F} \ \mathrm {d} S}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8622717a4dfb073341484e8433607bbcf119be8d) where the surface integral is calculated along the boundary _S_ of the volume _V_, |_V_| being the magnitude of the volume, and ![Image 17: {\displaystyle \mathbf {\hat {n}} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4eb84e133d15551d660800ec29b44783ff36e19d) pointing outward from the surface _S_ perpendicularly at every point in _S_.

In this formula, the cross product in the integrand measures the tangential component of **F** at each point on the surface _S_, and points along the surface at right angles to the _tangential projection_ of **F**. Integrating this cross product over the whole surface results in a vector whose magnitude measures the overall circulation of **F** around _S_, and whose direction is at right angles to this circulation. The above formula says that the _curl_ of a vector field at a point is the _infinitesimal volume density_ of this "circulation vector" around the point.

To this definition fits naturally another global formula (similar to the Kelvin-Stokes theorem) which equates the [volume integral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume_integral "Volume integral") of the curl of a vector field to the above surface integral taken over the boundary of the volume.

Whereas the above two definitions of the curl are coordinate free, there is another "easy to memorize" definition of the curl in curvilinear [orthogonal coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_coordinates "Orthogonal coordinates"), e.g. in [Cartesian coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinates "Cartesian coordinates"), [spherical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_coordinates "Spherical coordinates"), [cylindrical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylindrical_coordinates "Cylindrical coordinates"), or even [elliptical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_coordinate_system "Elliptic coordinate system") or [parabolic coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabolic_coordinates "Parabolic coordinates"): ![Image 18: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}&(\operatorname {curl} \mathbf {F} )_{1}={\frac {1}{h_{2}h_{3}}}\left({\frac {\partial (h_{3}F_{3})}{\partial u_{2}}}-{\frac {\partial (h_{2}F_{2})}{\partial u_{3}}}\right),\\[5pt]&(\operatorname {curl} \mathbf {F} )_{2}={\frac {1}{h_{3}h_{1}}}\left({\frac {\partial (h_{1}F_{1})}{\partial u_{3}}}-{\frac {\partial (h_{3}F_{3})}{\partial u_{1}}}\right),\\[5pt]&(\operatorname {curl} \mathbf {F} )_{3}={\frac {1}{h_{1}h_{2}}}\left({\frac {\partial (h_{2}F_{2})}{\partial u_{1}}}-{\frac {\partial (h_{1}F_{1})}{\partial u_{2}}}\right).\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/72c5af513489cd914b40cf463007656bc9a9cd3c)

The equation for each component (curl **F**)_k_ can be obtained by exchanging each occurrence of a subscript 1, 2, 3 in cyclic permutation: 1→2, 2→3, and 3→1 (where the subscripts represent the relevant indices).

If (_x_ 1, _x_ 2, _x_ 3) are the [Cartesian coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system "Cartesian coordinate system") and (_u_ 1, _u_ 2, _u_ 3) are the orthogonal coordinates, then ![Image 19: {\displaystyle h_{i}={\sqrt {\left({\frac {\partial x_{1}}{\partial u_{i}}}\right)^{2}+\left({\frac {\partial x_{2}}{\partial u_{i}}}\right)^{2}+\left({\frac {\partial x_{3}}{\partial u_{i}}}\right)^{2}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b01474046e71abce9fd77db756fda7d125c6ef94) is the length of the coordinate vector corresponding to _u i_. The remaining two components of curl result from [cyclic permutation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_permutation "Cyclic permutation") of [indices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_notation "Index notation"): 3,1,2→1,2,3→2,3,1.

In practice, the two coordinate-free definitions described above are rarely used because in virtually all cases, the curl [operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_(mathematics) "Operator (mathematics)") can be applied using some set of [curvilinear coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvilinear_coordinates "Curvilinear coordinates"), for which simpler representations have been derived.

The notation ![Image 20: {\displaystyle \nabla \times \mathbf {F} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c6e2429b7e3cb6965d1a6651703ff5ef0c88b378) has its origins in the similarities to the 3-dimensional [cross product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_product "Cross product"), and it is useful as a [mnemonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic "Mnemonic") in [Cartesian coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system "Cartesian coordinate system") if ![Image 21: {\displaystyle \nabla }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a3d0e93b78c50237f9ea83d027e4ebbdaef354b2) is taken as a vector [differential operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_operator "Differential operator")[del](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Del "Del"). Such notation involving [operators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_(physics) "Operator (physics)") is common in [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics") and [algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra "Algebra").

Expanded in 3-dimensional [Cartesian coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system "Cartesian coordinate system") (see _[Del in cylindrical and spherical coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Del\_in\_cylindrical\_and\_spherical\_coordinates "Del in cylindrical and spherical coordinates")_ for [spherical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_coordinate_system "Spherical coordinate system") and [cylindrical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylindrical_coordinate_system "Cylindrical coordinate system") coordinate representations), ![Image 22: {\displaystyle \nabla \times \mathbf {F} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c6e2429b7e3cb6965d1a6651703ff5ef0c88b378) is, for ![Image 23: {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/da18bef8c979f3548bb0d8976f5844012d7b8256) composed of ![Image 24: {\displaystyle [F_{x},F_{y},F_{z}]}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7e4bc1ea630c9672367135a8289315c1f1288555) (where the subscripts indicate the components of the vector, not partial derivatives): ![Image 25: {\displaystyle \nabla \times \mathbf {F} ={\begin{vmatrix}{\boldsymbol {\hat {\imath }}}&{\boldsymbol {\hat {\jmath }}}&{\boldsymbol {\hat {k}}}\\[5mu]{\dfrac {\partial }{\partial x}}&{\dfrac {\partial }{\partial y}}&{\dfrac {\partial }{\partial z}}\\[5mu]F_{x}&F_{y}&F_{z}\end{vmatrix}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5e5ef0821b7793380d87a3ddff6be1b5392e1ba2) where **i**, **j**, and **k** are the [unit vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_vector "Unit vector") for the _x_-, _y_-, and _z_-axes, respectively. This expands as follows:[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curl_(mathematics)#cite_note-8)![Image 26: {\displaystyle \nabla \times \mathbf {F} =\left({\frac {\partial F_{z}}{\partial y}}-{\frac {\partial F_{y}}{\partial z}}\right){\boldsymbol {\hat {\imath }}}+\left({\frac {\partial F_{x}}{\partial z}}-{\frac {\partial F_{z}}{\partial x}}\right){\boldsymbol {\hat {\jmath }}}+\left({\frac {\partial F_{y}}{\partial x}}-{\frac {\partial F_{x}}{\partial y}}\right){\boldsymbol {\hat {k}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/badb0e0551157fa14607bfacab3770f51036dc6c)

Although expressed in terms of coordinates, the result is invariant under proper rotations of the coordinate axes but the result inverts under reflection.

In a general coordinate system, the curl is given by[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curl_(mathematics)#cite_note-Mathworld-1)![Image 27: {\displaystyle (\nabla \times \mathbf {F} )^{k}={\frac {1}{\sqrt {g}}}\varepsilon ^{k\ell m}\nabla _{\ell }F_{m}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/842f53eeae2ec2174612d1b470e418dd1af050db) where ε denotes the [Levi-Civita tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levi-Civita_symbol#Levi-Civita_tensors "Levi-Civita symbol"), ∇ the [covariant derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariant_derivative "Covariant derivative"), ![Image 28: {\displaystyle g}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d3556280e66fe2c0d0140df20935a6f057381d77) is the [determinant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant "Determinant") of the [metric tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_tensor "Metric tensor") and the [Einstein summation convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_summation_convention "Einstein summation convention") implies that repeated indices are summed over. Due to the symmetry of the [Christoffel symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christoffel_symbols "Christoffel symbols") participating in the covariant derivative, this expression reduces to the [partial derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_derivative "Partial derivative"): ![Image 29: {\displaystyle (\nabla \times \mathbf {F} )={\frac {1}{\sqrt {g}}}\mathbf {R} _{k}\varepsilon ^{k\ell m}\partial _{\ell }F_{m}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/77851bb72dcd68d0db7b32c735704213d92659bf) where **R**_k_ are the local basis vectors. Equivalently, using the [exterior derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exterior_derivative "Exterior derivative"), the curl can be expressed as: ![Image 30: {\displaystyle \nabla \times \mathbf {F} =\left(\star {\big (}{\mathrm {d} }\mathbf {F} ^{\flat }{\big )}\right)^{\sharp }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d6072d0861db78ef87bb32a5700b5336f6820b2d)

Here ♭ and ♯ are the [musical isomorphisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_isomorphism "Musical isomorphism"), and ★ is the [Hodge star operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodge_star_operator "Hodge star operator"). This formula shows how to calculate the curl of **F** in any coordinate system, and how to extend the curl to any [oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientation_(space) "Orientation (space)") three-dimensional [Riemannian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_metric "Riemannian metric") manifold. Since this depends on a choice of orientation, curl is a [chiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chirality_(mathematics) "Chirality (mathematics)") operation. In other words, if the orientation is reversed, then the direction of the curl is also reversed.

Suppose the vector field describes the [velocity field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity_field "Velocity field") of a [fluid flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_flow "Fluid flow") (such as a large tank of [liquid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid "Liquid") or [gas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas "Gas")) and a small ball is located within the fluid or gas (the center of the ball being fixed at a certain point). If the ball has a rough surface, the fluid flowing past it will make it rotate. The rotation axis (oriented according to the right hand rule) points in the direction of the curl of the field at the center of the ball, and the angular speed of the rotation is half the magnitude of the curl at this point.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curl_(mathematics)#cite_note-9) The curl of the vector field at any point is given by the rotation of an infinitesimal area in the _xy_-plane (for _z_-axis component of the curl), _zx_-plane (for _y_-axis component of the curl) and _yz_-plane (for _x_-axis component of the curl vector). This can be seen in the examples below.

[![Image 32](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/Curl_of_uniform_curl.png/250px-Curl_of_uniform_curl.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Curl_of_uniform_curl.png)

Vector field **F**(_x_,_y_)=[_y_,−_x_] (left) and its curl (right).

The [vector field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_field "Vector field")![Image 33: {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} (x,y,z)=y{\boldsymbol {\hat {\imath }}}-x{\boldsymbol {\hat {\jmath }}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c348bd198fa64fa96ba66ab6d112940fb60b4eff) can be decomposed as ![Image 34: {\displaystyle F_{x}=y,F_{y}=-x,F_{z}=0.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b7d8499c78a72aa72468a27af0fb7d2e59531085)

Upon visual inspection, the field can be described as "rotating". If the vectors of the field were to represent a linear [force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force "Force") acting on objects present at that point, and an object were to be placed inside the field, the object would start to rotate clockwise around itself. This is true regardless of where the object is placed.

Calculating the curl: ![Image 35: {\displaystyle \nabla \times \mathbf {F} =0{\boldsymbol {\hat {\imath }}}+0{\boldsymbol {\hat {\jmath }}}+\left({\frac {\partial }{\partial x}}(-x)-{\frac {\partial }{\partial y}}y\right){\boldsymbol {\hat {k}}}=-2{\boldsymbol {\hat {k}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5232fd2c839606bd0f9c3378efb7857cce0938a5)

The resulting vector field describing the curl would at all points be pointing in the negative _z_ direction. The results of this equation align with what could have been predicted using the [right-hand rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-hand_rule#A_rotating_body "Right-hand rule") using a [right-handed coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system#In_three_dimensions "Cartesian coordinate system"). Being a uniform vector field, the object described before would have the same rotational intensity regardless of where it was placed.

[![Image 36](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/Nonuniform_curl.svg/250px-Nonuniform_curl.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Nonuniform_curl.svg)

[![Image 37](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Curl_of_nonuniform_curl.png/250px-Curl_of_nonuniform_curl.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Curl_of_nonuniform_curl.png)

Vector field **F**(_x_, _y_) = [0, −_x_ 2] (left) and its curl (right).

For the vector field ![Image 38: {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} (x,y,z)=-x^{2}{\boldsymbol {\hat {\jmath }}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f10a6c435538673d364ff769f42aa672fe13ee04)

the curl is not as obvious from the graph. However, taking the object in the previous example, and placing it anywhere on the line _x_ = 3, the force exerted on the right side would be slightly greater than the force exerted on the left, causing it to rotate clockwise. Using the right-hand rule, it can be predicted that the resulting curl would be straight in the negative _z_ direction. Inversely, if placed on _x_ = −3, the object would rotate counterclockwise and the right-hand rule would result in a positive _z_ direction.

Calculating the curl: ![Image 39: {\displaystyle {\nabla }\times \mathbf {F} =0{\boldsymbol {\hat {\imath }}}+0{\boldsymbol {\hat {\jmath }}}+{\frac {\partial }{\partial x}}\left(-x^{2}\right){\boldsymbol {\hat {k}}}=-2x{\boldsymbol {\hat {k}}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4816c8b8cf070fb594716a153a0bb602dcaad8fa)

The curl points in the negative _z_ direction when _x_ is positive and vice versa. In this field, the intensity of rotation would be greater as the object moves away from the plane _x_ = 0.

*   In a vector field describing the linear velocities of each part of a rotating disk in [uniform circular motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_circular_motion "Uniform circular motion"), the curl has the same value at all points, and this value turns out to be exactly two times the vectorial [angular velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_velocity "Angular velocity") of the disk (oriented as usual by the [right-hand rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-hand_rule "Right-hand rule")). More generally, for any flowing mass, the linear velocity vector field at each point of the mass flow has a curl (the [vorticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vorticity "Vorticity") of the flow at that point) equal to exactly two times the _local_ vectorial angular velocity of the mass about the point.
*   For any solid object subject to an external physical force (such as gravity or the electromagnetic force), one may consider the vector field representing the infinitesimal force-per-unit-volume contributions acting at each of the points of the object. This force field may create a net _[torque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque "Torque")_ on the object about its center of mass, and this torque turns out to be directly proportional and vectorially parallel to the (vector-valued) integral of the _curl_ of the force field over the whole volume.
*   Of the four [Maxwell's equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations "Maxwell's equations"), two—[Faraday's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday%27s_law_of_induction "Faraday's law of induction") and [Ampère's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amp%C3%A8re%27s_circuital_law "Ampère's circuital law")—can be compactly expressed using curl. Faraday's law states that the curl of an [electric field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_field "Electric field") is equal to the opposite of the time rate of change of the magnetic field, while Ampère's law relates the curl of the magnetic field to the current and the time rate of change of the electric field.

In general [curvilinear coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvilinear_coordinates "Curvilinear coordinates") (not only in Cartesian coordinates), the curl of a cross product of vector fields **v** and **F** can be shown to be ![Image 40: {\displaystyle \nabla \times \left(\mathbf {v\times F} \right)={\Big (}\left(\mathbf {\nabla \cdot F} \right)+\mathbf {F\cdot \nabla } {\Big )}\mathbf {v} -{\Big (}\left(\mathbf {\nabla \cdot v} \right)+\mathbf {v\cdot \nabla } {\Big )}\mathbf {F} \ .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5f9123b6f5a01bcb5820cba3ff47c7aba2397b83)

Interchanging the vector field **v** and ∇ operator, we arrive at the cross product of a vector field with curl of a vector field: ![Image 41: {\displaystyle \mathbf {v\ \times } \left(\mathbf {\nabla \times F} \right)=\nabla _{\mathbf {F} }\left(\mathbf {v\cdot F} \right)-\left(\mathbf {v\cdot \nabla } \right)\mathbf {F} \ ,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/cdb6c1c59d204e2074b395e735b8ab73f279449d) where ∇**F** is the Feynman subscript notation, which considers only the variation due to the vector field **F** (i.e., in this case, **v** is treated as being constant in space).

Another example is the curl of a curl of a vector field. It can be shown that in general coordinates ![Image 42: {\displaystyle \nabla \times \left(\mathbf {\nabla \times F} \right)=\mathbf {\nabla } (\mathbf {\nabla \cdot F} )-\nabla ^{2}\mathbf {F} \ ,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b597d6a26186c37de8e7d02781a003bb04b6a38d) and this identity defines the [vector Laplacian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_Laplacian "Vector Laplacian") of **F**, symbolized as ∇2**F**.

The curl of the [gradient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient "Gradient") of _any_[scalar field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_field "Scalar field")φ is always the [zero vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_vector "Zero vector") field ![Image 43: {\displaystyle \nabla \times (\nabla \varphi )={\boldsymbol {0}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/70e6f540bd6429f38a18cb816b4517d94184e7e8) which follows from the [antisymmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisymmetric_tensor "Antisymmetric tensor") in the definition of the curl, and the [symmetry of second derivatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry_of_second_derivatives "Symmetry of second derivatives").

The [divergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergence "Divergence") of the curl of any vector field is equal to zero: ![Image 44: {\displaystyle \nabla \cdot (\nabla \times \mathbf {F} )=0.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c68d1bddef06bd6354ad727f65c3cc9cd24c921a)

If φ is a scalar valued function and **F** is a vector field, then ![Image 45: {\displaystyle \nabla \times (\varphi \mathbf {F} )=\nabla \varphi \times \mathbf {F} +\varphi \nabla \times \mathbf {F} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3dc21562e2a08f9bcb4fec7fdee27c44f1ea82c4)

The vector calculus operations of [grad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient "Gradient"), curl, and [div](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergence "Divergence") are most easily generalized in the context of differential forms, which involves a number of steps. In short, they correspond to the derivatives of 0-forms, 1-forms, and 2-forms, respectively. The geometric interpretation of curl as rotation corresponds to identifying [bivectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bivector "Bivector") (2-vectors) in 3 dimensions with the [special orthogonal Lie algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_orthogonal_Lie_algebra "Special orthogonal Lie algebra")![Image 46: {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {so}}(3)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fb4f1d3d3bf3da64b92af1a1018ce00545808b9d) of infinitesimal rotations (in coordinates, skew-symmetric 3×3 matrices), while representing rotations by vectors corresponds to identifying 1-vectors (equivalently, 2-vectors) and ![Image 47: {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {so}}(3)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fb4f1d3d3bf3da64b92af1a1018ce00545808b9d), these all being 3-dimensional spaces.

In 3 dimensions, a differential 0-form is a real-valued function ![Image 48: {\displaystyle f(x,y,z)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f5d48dce2c4341575269f1709237a2e18923237a); a differential 1-form is the following expression, where the coefficients are functions: ![Image 49: {\displaystyle a_{1}\,dx+a_{2}\,dy+a_{3}\,dz;}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8dbd113b2345d300b2598f75cd253408fb6af6a2) a differential 2-form is the formal sum, again with function coefficients: ![Image 50: {\displaystyle a_{12}\,dx\wedge dy+a_{13}\,dx\wedge dz+a_{23}\,dy\wedge dz;}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7e9460286377d56bfe66d85d93140e20c89d8fda) and a differential 3-form is defined by a single term with one function as coefficient: ![Image 51: {\displaystyle a_{123}\,dx\wedge dy\wedge dz.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bde9c350758b3de6922eb755758b4cd9d2102d94) (Here the a-coefficients are real functions of three variables; the [wedge products](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedge_product "Wedge product"), e.g. ![Image 52: {\displaystyle {\text{d}}x\wedge {\text{d}}y}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/885fc2cd7b2f882c838615f6192fbe05a48f71f6), can be interpreted as [oriented plane segments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bivector "Bivector"), ![Image 53: {\displaystyle {\text{d}}x\wedge {\text{d}}y=-{\text{d}}y\wedge {\text{d}}x}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3a54fbe3271a511f069256ca81edefb6aae7736f), etc.)

The [exterior derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exterior_derivative "Exterior derivative") of a _k_-form in **R**3 is defined as the (_k_ + 1)-form from above—and in **R**_n_ if, e.g., ![Image 54: {\displaystyle \omega ^{(k)}=\sum _{1\leq i_{1}<i_{2}<\cdots <i_{k}\leq n}a_{i_{1},\ldots ,i_{k}}\,dx_{i_{1}}\wedge \cdots \wedge dx_{i_{k}},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/efe27b41cf3d774b124122a984d98643e7760f90) then the exterior derivative _d_ leads to ![Image 55: {\displaystyle d\omega ^{(k)}=\sum _{\scriptstyle {j=1} \atop \scriptstyle {i_{1}<\cdots <i_{k}}}^{n}{\frac {\partial a_{i_{1},\ldots ,i_{k}}}{\partial x_{j}}}\,dx_{j}\wedge dx_{i_{1}}\wedge \cdots \wedge dx_{i_{k}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5bc068743ecfe7cb9d1a102736c6c13bfe3c1d8d)

The exterior derivative of a 1-form is therefore a 2-form, and that of a 2-form is a 3-form. On the other hand, because of the interchangeability of mixed derivatives, ![Image 56: {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial ^{2}}{\partial x_{i}\,\partial x_{j}}}={\frac {\partial ^{2}}{\partial x_{j}\,\partial x_{i}}},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fd39b2f86926c22d4aefc74846c0aa31b09c60ca) and antisymmetry, ![Image 57: {\displaystyle dx_{i}\wedge dx_{j}=-dx_{j}\wedge dx_{i}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a823338715a2f8af08db3701ad20e957bced33cb)

the twofold application of the exterior derivative yields ![Image 58: {\displaystyle 0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2aae8864a3c1fec9585261791a809ddec1489950) (the zero ![Image 59: {\displaystyle k+2}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/141170bc6765f9f664fe148de50dec24f03e69f5)-form).

Thus, denoting the space of _k_-forms by ![Image 60: {\displaystyle \Omega ^{k}(\mathbb {R} ^{3})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/70fd3ac0eb889dc34b7cd41e8ac987f7a680ec3b) and the exterior derivative by _d_ one gets a sequence: ![Image 61: {\displaystyle 0\,{\overset {d}{\longrightarrow }}\;\Omega ^{0}\left(\mathbb {R} ^{3}\right)\,{\overset {d}{\longrightarrow }}\;\Omega ^{1}\left(\mathbb {R} ^{3}\right)\,{\overset {d}{\longrightarrow }}\;\Omega ^{2}\left(\mathbb {R} ^{3}\right)\,{\overset {d}{\longrightarrow }}\;\Omega ^{3}\left(\mathbb {R} ^{3}\right)\,{\overset {d}{\longrightarrow }}\,0.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0c320088c091e541fbbd58668a6c2cb7b7305eb6)

Here ![Image 62: {\displaystyle \Omega ^{k}(\mathbb {R} ^{n})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/35c74b5baebc27b523068f729d15727cb1e055f5) is the space of sections of the [exterior algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exterior_algebra "Exterior algebra")![Image 63: {\displaystyle \Lambda ^{k}(\mathbb {R} ^{n})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ca594d9124e4f9066cbed4ea52c11a421cee210e)[vector bundle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_bundle "Vector bundle") over **R**_n_, whose dimension is the [binomial coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient "Binomial coefficient")![Image 64: {\displaystyle {\binom {n}{k}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/963a810ba39e3e0725c523d0c98b18f39786ebb2); note that ![Image 65: {\displaystyle \Omega ^{k}(\mathbb {R} ^{3})=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/909abd93ece372afef9516c158390bde4fe20e33) for ![Image 66: {\displaystyle k>3}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/45c55b4ff0d61c81d264463917a795a521e8e5c8) or ![Image 67: {\displaystyle k<0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d59e54fad8568e90715f2b10521d3e39bc45fca9). Writing only dimensions, one obtains a row of [Pascal's triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_triangle "Pascal's triangle"):

![Image 68: {\displaystyle 0\rightarrow 1\rightarrow 3\rightarrow 3\rightarrow 1\rightarrow 0;}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b853e28f3f08da4fa9485678fe866a459495c41d)

the 1-dimensional fibers correspond to scalar fields, and the 3-dimensional fibers to vector fields, as described below. Modulo suitable identifications, the three nontrivial occurrences of the exterior derivative correspond to grad, curl, and div.

Differential forms and the differential can be defined on any Euclidean space, or indeed any manifold, without any notion of a Riemannian metric. On a [Riemannian manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_manifold "Riemannian manifold"), or more generally [pseudo-Riemannian manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo-Riemannian_manifold "Pseudo-Riemannian manifold"), _k_-forms can be identified with [_k_-vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-vector "P-vector") fields (_k_-forms are _k_-covector fields, and a pseudo-Riemannian metric gives an isomorphism between vectors and covectors), and on an _oriented_ vector space with a [nondegenerate form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondegenerate_form "Nondegenerate form") (an isomorphism between vectors and covectors), there is an isomorphism between _k_-vectors and (_n_ − _k_)-vectors; in particular on (the tangent space of) an oriented pseudo-Riemannian manifold. Thus on an oriented pseudo-Riemannian manifold, one can interchange _k_-forms, _k_-vector fields, (_n_ − _k_)-forms, and (_n_ − _k_)-vector fields; this is known as [Hodge duality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodge_duality "Hodge duality"). Concretely, on **R**3 this is given by:

*   1-forms and 1-vector fields: the 1-form _a x dx_ + _a y dy_ + _a z dz_ corresponds to the vector field (_a x_, _a y_, _a z_).
*   1-forms and 2-forms: one replaces _dx_ by the dual quantity _dy_ ∧ _dz_ (i.e., omit _dx_), and likewise, taking care of orientation: _dy_ corresponds to _dz_ ∧ _dx_ = −_dx_ ∧ _dz_, and _dz_ corresponds to _dx_ ∧ _dy_. Thus the form _a x dx_ + _a y dy_ + _a z dz_ corresponds to the "dual form" _a z dx_ ∧ _dy_ + _a y dz_ ∧ _dx_ + _a x dy_ ∧ _dz_.

Thus, identifying 0-forms and 3-forms with scalar fields, and 1-forms and 2-forms with vector fields:

*   grad takes a scalar field (0-form) to a vector field (1-form);
*   curl takes a vector field (1-form) to a pseudovector field (2-form);
*   div takes a pseudovector field (2-form) to a pseudoscalar field (3-form)

On the other hand, the fact that _d_ 2 = 0 corresponds to the identities ![Image 69: {\displaystyle \nabla \times (\nabla f)=\mathbf {0} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/920b02b8188ca74a106d7201fd52b7b7297c90ca) for any scalar field f, and ![Image 70: {\displaystyle \nabla \cdot (\nabla \times \mathbf {v} )=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c5c4f9da2b6ecac88812b7dbda95ecace8c7aada) for any vector field **v**.

Grad and div generalize to all oriented pseudo-Riemannian manifolds, with the same geometric interpretation, because the spaces of 0-forms and _n_-forms at each point are always 1-dimensional and can be identified with scalar fields, while the spaces of 1-forms and (_n_ − 1)-forms are always fiberwise _n_-dimensional and can be identified with vector fields.

Curl does not generalize in this way to 4 or more dimensions (or down to 2 or fewer dimensions); in 4 dimensions the dimensions are

0 → 1 → 4 → 6 → 4 → 1 → 0;

so the curl of a 1-vector field (fiberwise 4-dimensional) is a _2-vector field_, which at each point belongs to 6-dimensional vector space, and so one has ![Image 71: {\displaystyle \omega ^{(2)}=\sum _{i<k=1,2,3,4}a_{i,k}\,dx_{i}\wedge dx_{k},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/cb63e39ae1c4ddd96d79337457ffb6db728baa2a) which yields a sum of six independent terms, and cannot be identified with a 1-vector field. Nor can one meaningfully go from a 1-vector field to a 2-vector field to a 3-vector field (4 → 6 → 4), as taking the differential twice yields zero (_d_ 2 = 0). Thus there is no curl function from vector fields to vector fields in other dimensions arising in this way.

However, one can define a curl of a vector field as a _2-vector field_ in general, as described below.

2-vectors correspond to the exterior power Λ 2 _V_; in the presence of an inner product, in coordinates these are the skew-symmetric matrices, which are geometrically considered as the [special orthogonal Lie algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_orthogonal_Lie_algebra "Special orthogonal Lie algebra")![Image 72: {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {so}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d751e9193970241df0a4a3cb78cbbb63c85514f9)(_V_) of infinitesimal rotations. This has (_n_

2) = ⁠1/2⁠_n_(_n_ − 1) dimensions, and allows one to interpret the differential of a 1-vector field as its infinitesimal rotations. Only in 3 dimensions (or trivially in 0 dimensions) we have _n_ = ⁠1/2⁠_n_(_n_ − 1), which is the most elegant and common case. In 2 dimensions the curl of a vector field is not a vector field but a function, as 2-dimensional rotations are given by an angle (a scalar– an orientation is required to choose whether one counts clockwise or counterclockwise rotations as positive); this is not the div, but is rather perpendicular to it. In 3 dimensions the curl of a vector field is a vector field as is familiar (in 1 and 0 dimensions the curl of a vector field is 0, because there are no non-trivial 2-vectors), while in 4 dimensions the curl of a vector field is, geometrically, at each point an element of the 6-dimensional Lie algebra ![Image 73: {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {so}}(4)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bc551dec4339f755ad51933dab462f5ccfa0c27a).

The curl of a 3-dimensional vector field which only depends on 2 coordinates (say _x_ and _y_) is simply a vertical vector field (in the _z_ direction) whose magnitude is the curl of the 2-dimensional vector field, as in the examples on this page.

Considering curl as a 2-vector field (an antisymmetric 2-tensor) has been used to generalize vector calculus and associated physics to higher dimensions.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curl_(mathematics)#cite_note-10)

In the case where the divergence of a vector field **V** is zero, a vector field **W** exists such that **V** = curl(**W**).[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] This is why the [magnetic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field "Magnetic field"), characterized by zero divergence, can be expressed as the curl of a [magnetic vector potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_vector_potential "Magnetic vector potential").

If **W** is a vector field with curl(**W**) = **V**, then adding any gradient vector field grad(_f_) to **W** will result in another vector field **W** + grad(_f_) such that curl(**W** + grad(_f_)) = **V** as well. This can be summarized by saying that the inverse curl of a three-dimensional vector field can be obtained up to an unknown [irrotational field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrotational_field "Irrotational field") with the [Biot–Savart law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biot%E2%80%93Savart_law "Biot–Savart law").
