In [punctuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punctuation "Punctuation"), a **word divider** is a form of [glyph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyph "Glyph") which separates written [words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word "Word"). In languages which use the [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_alphabet "Latin alphabet"), [Cyrillic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrillic_script "Cyrillic script"), and [Arabic alphabets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_alphabet "Arabic alphabet"), as well as other scripts of Europe and West Asia, the word divider is a blank [space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(punctuation) "Space (punctuation)"), or _whitespace_. This convention is spreading, along with other aspects of European punctuation, to Asia and Africa, where words are usually written without word separation.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_divider#cite_note-1)[_[better source needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTRS "Wikipedia:NOTRS")_]

In [character encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_encoding "Character encoding"), [word segmentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_segmentation#Word_segmentation "Text segmentation") depends on which characters are defined as word dividers.

In [Ancient Egyptian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_hieroglyphs "Egyptian hieroglyphs"), [determinatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinative "Determinative") may have been used as much to demarcate word boundaries as to disambiguate the semantics of words.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_divider#cite_note-2) Rarely in [Assyrian cuneiform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assyrian_cuneiform "Assyrian cuneiform"), but commonly in the later cuneiform [Ugaritic alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ugaritic_alphabet "Ugaritic alphabet"), a vertical stroke íë∞ was used to separate words. In [Old Persian cuneiform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Persian_cuneiform "Old Persian cuneiform"), a diagonally sloping wedge êèê was used.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_divider#cite_note-3)

As the alphabet spread throughout the ancient world, words were often run together without division, and this practice remains or remained until recently in much of South and Southeast Asia. However, not infrequently in inscriptions a vertical line, and in manuscripts a single (¬∑), double (:), or triple (‚Åù) [interpunct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpunct "Interpunct") (dot) was used to divide words. This practice was found in [Phoenician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenician_alphabet "Phoenician alphabet"), [Aramaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aramaic_alphabet "Aramaic alphabet"), [Hebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_alphabet "Hebrew alphabet"), [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_alphabet "Greek alphabet"), and [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_alphabet "Latin alphabet"), and continues today with [Ethiopic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ge%27ez_alphabet "Ge'ez alphabet"), though there whitespace is gaining ground.

The early [alphabetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet "Alphabet") writing systems, such as the [Phoenician alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenician_alphabet "Phoenician alphabet"), had only signs for [consonants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consonant "Consonant") (although some signs for consonants could also stand for a [vowel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel "Vowel"), so-called _[matres lectionis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matres\_lectionis "Matres lectionis")_). Without some form of visible word dividers, parsing a text into its separate words would have been a puzzle. With the introduction of letters representing vowels in the [Greek alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_alphabet "Greek alphabet"), the need for inter-word separation lessened. The earliest Greek inscriptions used interpuncts, as was common in the writing systems which preceded it, but soon the practice of _[scriptio continua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scriptio\_continua "Scriptio continua")_, continuous writing in which all words ran together without separation became common.

Alphabetic writing without inter-word separation, known as _[scriptio continua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scriptio\_continua "Scriptio continua")_, was used in Ancient Egyptian. It appeared in Post-classical Latin after several centuries of the use of the interpunct.

Traditionally, _scriptio continua_ was used for the [Indic alphabets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmic_scripts "Brahmic scripts") of South and Southeast Asia and [hangul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangul "Hangul") of Korea, but spacing is now used with hangul and increasingly with the Indic alphabets.

Today [Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Written_Chinese "Written Chinese") and [Japanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_writing "Japanese writing") are the most widely used scripts consistently written without punctuation to separate words, though other scripts such as [Thai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thai_script "Thai script") and [Lao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lao_script "Lao script") also follow this writing convention. In Classical Chinese, a word and a [character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_character "Chinese character") were almost the same thing, so that word dividers would have been superfluous. Although [Modern Mandarin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Mandarin "Standard Mandarin") has numerous polysyllabic words, and each syllable is written with a distinct character, the conceptual link between character and word or at least [morpheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morpheme "Morpheme") remains strong, and no need is felt for word separation apart from what characters already provide. This link is also found in the [Vietnamese language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_language "Vietnamese language"); however, in the [Vietnamese alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_alphabet "Vietnamese alphabet"), virtually all syllables are separated by spaces, whether or not they form word boundaries.

Space is the most common word divider, especially in [Latin script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_script "Latin script").

Ancient inscribed and cuneiform scripts such as [Anatolian hieroglyphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatolian_hieroglyphs "Anatolian hieroglyphs") frequently used short vertical lines to separate words, as did [Linear B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_B "Linear B"). In manuscripts, vertical lines were more commonly used for larger breaks, equivalent to the Latin comma and period. This continues with many Indic scripts today (the [danda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danda "Danda")).

The Ethiopic double interpunct

As noted above, the single and double interpunct were used in manuscripts (on paper) throughout the ancient world. For example, Ethiopic inscriptions used a vertical line, whereas manuscripts used double dots (·ç°) resembling a colon. The latter practice continues today, though the space is making inroads. Classical Latin used the interpunct in both paper manuscripts and stone inscriptions.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_divider#cite_note-5)[Ancient Greek orthography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_orthography#Punctuation "Greek orthography") used between two and five dots as word separators, as well as the [hypodiastole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypodiastole "Hypodiastole").

### Different letter forms

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Word_divider&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Different letter forms")]

In the modern [Hebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_alphabet "Hebrew alphabet") and [Arabic alphabets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_alphabet "Arabic alphabet"), some letters have distinct forms at the ends and/or beginnings of words. This demarcation is used in addition to spacing.

### Vertical arrangement

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Word_divider&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Vertical arrangement")]

Nasta ølƒ´q used for Urdu (written right-to-left)

The [Nasta ølƒ´q](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasta%CA%BFl%C4%ABq_script "Nasta ølƒ´q script") form of [Islamic calligraphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_calligraphy "Islamic calligraphy") uses vertical arrangement to separate words. The beginning of each word is written higher than the end of the preceding word, so that a line of text takes on a [sawtooth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sawtooth_wave "Sawtooth wave") appearance. Nastaliq spread from Persia and today is used for [Persian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_language "Persian language"), [Uyghur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uyghur_language "Uyghur language"), [Pashto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pashto_language "Pashto language"), and [Urdu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urdu "Urdu").

In [finger spelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger_spelling "Finger spelling") and in [Morse code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code "Morse code"), words are separated by a pause.
