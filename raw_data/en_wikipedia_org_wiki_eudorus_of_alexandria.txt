[ 1 ] He attempted to reconstruct Plato 's philosophy in terms of Pythagoreanism .

[ 2 ] Life [ edit ] Little is known about Eudorus' life. Chronologically, he lived in the 1st century BC, and did his work prior to Strabo and Arius Didymus , both of whom quote him.

[ 3 ] He was involved in a plagiarism controversy with Aristo of Alexandria , one of Antiochus of Ascalon 's students, as they had both written a work on the Nile.

[ 4 ] but he is not mentioned by Antiochus' contemporary Cicero , implying he was not one of Antiochus' students.

[ 3 ] Eudorus also wrote a survey of philosophy, at least one portion of which dealt with ethics, of which a summary by Arius Didymus is preserved in Stobaeus .

[ 5 ] [ 3 ] He also wrote a commentary on Plato's Timaeus which is referred to by Plutarch, [ 3 ] and may also have written a commentary on the Categories of Aristotle .

[ 3 ] Philosophy [ edit ] Eudorus combined Platonist , Pythagorean and Stoic ideas in his philosophy.

[ 6 ] He divided philosophy into ethics, physics, and logic, taking Ethics as prior to Physics, as opposed to the Stoics, who considered physics to come before ethics.

[ 3 ] In ethics, Eudorus formulated a teleological principle for Platonism, derived from the Theaetetus : "as much as we can, become like God." [ 7 ] In this he believed that he had found an apt definition of the common goal of Pythagoras , Socrates , and Plato .

[ 6 ] In physics, Eudorus' account of first principles , [ 8 ] postulates the existence of a highest principle, called " The One ," above the Pythagorean Monad and Dyad , which Eudorus called God .

[ 9 ] Although Eudorus considers this to be a Pythagorean doctrine, modern scholars such as John M. Dillon consider this to have likely originated with Eudorus, based on the extant Pythagorean fragments recorded by Alexander Polyhistor , which show little or no trace of this doctrine.

[ 9 ] In logic, Eudorus appears to have rejected Aristotle's theory of categories, preferring to derive them from the Old Academy categories of "Absolute" and "Relative" which were developed by Xenocrates .

[ 10 ] Legacy [ edit ] Eudorus is mentioned by Alexander of Aphrodisias in his commentary on Aristotle 's Metaphysics .

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] Simplicius refers to him as a Peripatetic philosopher, and relates that he had written on the Aristotelian Categories .

The way Aristotle's texts were available to Eudorus is now an open field for research.
