[ 1 ] Contemporary understanding [ edit ] Robert Ashford argues that the concept of inclusive capitalism is rooted in the postulates of the binary economics .

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] C. K. Prahalad opens his 2005 book The Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid: Eradicating Poverty Through Profits by asking “Why can’t we create inclusive capitalism”.

[ 4 ] He uses the term “inclusive capitalism” to invite readers to focus on underserved consumers and markets in order to create opportunity for all.

[ 5 ] Implementation [ edit ] In 2012, the Henry Jackson Society created an Inclusive Capitalism Initiative task force in order to start a transatlantic conversation about the growing income inequalities and their threat to the capitalist system.

[ 6 ] In 2014, Conference on Inclusive Capitalism, co-hosted by the City of London and E. L. Rothschild holding company, was held in London where the concept of inclusive capitalism was discussed as a practical measure.

[ 7 ] At another conference in 2015 the "Pathway to Action" was brainstormed.

[ 8 ] In the same 2015 year, the Coalition for Inclusive Capitalism was registered in the United States as a not-for-profit organization.

[ 9 ] Lynn Forester de Rothschild became the founding CEO of the Coalition. At the 2016 Conference on Inclusive Capitalism in New York City , participants expressed commitment to promote inclusive economic growth.

[ 10 ] Members of the Coalition expressed a belief that all stakeholders, including business and society, should be engaged in the enactment of an inclusive capitalism agenda [ 1 ] [ 11 ] In 2019, the Embankment Project for Inclusive Capitalism (EPIC) undertaken by the Coalition together with Ernst & Young reported its findings in a white paper. It was a pioneering effort to "develop a framework and identify meaningful metrics to report on long-term and inclusive value creation activities that heretofore have not been captured on traditional financial statements".

[ 12 ] In 2020, the Council for Inclusive Capitalism, a partnership of the Coalition with the Vatican, was created.

[ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] Criticism [ edit ] John Kay claims that most of the 21st-century businesses are already inclusive.

[ 16 ] Nafeez Ahmed describes the Inclusive Capitalism Initiative as a Trojan Horse assembled to pacify the coming global revolt against capitalism.
