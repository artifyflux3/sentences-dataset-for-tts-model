Bull Website www .usf .edu The University of South Florida ( USF ) is a public research university with its main campus located in Tampa , Florida , United States, and other campuses in St. Petersburg and Sarasota . It is one of 12 members of the State University System of Florida . USF is home to 14 colleges, offering more than 240 undergraduate, graduate, specialist, and doctoral-level degree programs.

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] USF is classified among "R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity" and is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools .

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] USF is a member of the Association of American Universities (AAU) and is designated by the Florida Board of Governors as one of three Preeminent State Research Universities.

[ 9 ] [ 12 ] Founded in 1956, USF is the fourth largest university in Florida by enrollment, with 49,766 students from over 145 countries, all 50 states, all five U.S. Territories , and the District of Columbia as of the 2022–2023 academic year.

[ 5 ] [ 13 ] In 2022, the university reported an annual budget of $2.31 billion and an annual economic impact of over $6 billion.

[ 14 ] According to the National Science Foundation , USF spent $568 million on research and development in 2019, ranking it 43rd in the nation and 25th among public universities.

[ 15 ] [ 16 ] USF's $889 million endowment is the third-largest among Florida public universities and the largest of any American public university founded post-World War II.

In its 2018 ranking, the Intellectual Property Owners Association placed USF 1st in Florida, 7th in the United States, and 16th worldwide in the number of US patents granted.

[ 17 ] USF faculty, staff, students, and alumni collectively hold over 2,400 patents. USF is home to the National Academy of Inventors and the Florida Inventors Hall of Fame , both located in the USF Research Park in the southwest side of campus.

[ 18 ] USF's sports teams are known as the South Florida Bulls and primarily compete in the American Conference of NCAA Division I . USF's 21 varsity teams have won a combined 6 national championships and 171 conference championships. Athletes representing the Bulls have won an additional 24 individual and relay national championships and 256 individual and relay conference championships.

[ 19 ] History [ edit ] Hillsborough Army Airfield , also known as Henderson Airfield, on the site of what is now the University of South Florida 1950s [ edit ] USF was the first state university in Florida built during the 20th century.

[ 20 ] Former U.S. representative Samuel Gibbons was instrumental in the school's creation when he was a state representative. He is considered by many to be the "Father of USF".

[ 21 ] Although founded in 1956, the university was not officially named until the following year, and classes did not begin until 1960.

[ 20 ] The university was built off Fowler Avenue on the former site of Henderson Air Field , a World War II airstrip.

[ 20 ] Before Henderson Field, the area was part of a 5,000-acre temple orange grove, the largest citrus grove in the world at the time, which gave the nearby city of Temple Terrace its name.

In 1957, the Florida Cabinet approved the name "University of South Florida".

[ 20 ] At the time, USF was the southernmost university in the state university system.

[ 20 ] 1960s [ edit ] The first five buildings on campus when the student opened were the old library (now the student services building), the science building (now the chemistry building), the teaching auditorium (no longer standing, on the site of what is now the music building), the university center (no longer standing, on the site of what is now the Marshall Student Center), and the administration building (now called the John and Grace Allen Administration building).

The university was founded as a school for whites only . It integrated and admitted its first African-American student, Ernest Boger , in 1961, the school's second year after opening. Boger graduated in 1964 with a B.A. in psychology.

[ 22 ] In 1962, students voted to make the "Golden Brahman" the university's mascot, named after the state's cattle raising industry.

[ 20 ] In the early 1980s, the mascot evolved into the "Bulls".

[ 23 ] In 1963, USF held its first graduation ceremony. 325 degrees were conferred.

[ 24 ] The university grew rapidly under the leadership of John S. Allen , who served as its first president from 1956 until his retirement in 1971.

[ 20 ] During this time, the university expanded rapidly, due in part to the first master's degree programs commencing in 1964.

[ 20 ] Allen was infamously known for his opposition to college sports in favor of placing an "Accent on Learning", USF's original motto.

[ 25 ] He received national attention after declaring in 1959 that the school would have no sports teams, though he later had a change of heart and USF's first varsity teams would begin in 1965.

[ 26 ] Allen's ultimate legacy was to be the first person to build a modern state university from scratch, famously stating: "As a completely new and separate institution, the University of South Florida became the first new institution of its kind to be conceived, planned and built in the United States in the 20th century".

[ 27 ] Today the John and Grace Allen Administration Building, named after the university's founding president and his wife, houses vital Tampa campus departments including Student Affairs, the Admissions Welcome Center, and the Controller's Office.

[ 28 ] USF's St. Petersburg campus opened in 1965 as a satellite campus . The site was known as the "Bay Campus" at the time and sat on the former site of the U.S. Navy Maritime Training Center.

[ 29 ] USF's campus was damaged by an F4 tornado during the tornado outbreak of April 4–5, 1966 , with the cooling towers at the university's power plant partially collapsing and the roof being ripped off of one of the dormitories.

[ citation needed ] 1970s [ edit ] In 1970, M. Cecil Mackey became the university's second president.

[ 20 ] During his time at USF, Mackey opened the university's medical school, School of Nursing, and first-ever Ph.D.

program.

[ 20 ] [ 30 ] Additionally, Mackey worked to strengthen the St. Petersburg campus, while opening new satellite campuses in Sarasota and Fort Myers.

[ 20 ] While serving as university president, Mackey continued to teach economics courses in a conference room across from his office.

[ 30 ] Mackey first coined a new descriptor for USF: a "metropolitan university".

[ 30 ] The term is still used to describe USF and other colleges in large cities today.

USF Sarasota–Manatee was founded in 1975 and shared a campus with New College of Florida , which later became part of the USF system as well before becoming an independent university again.

[ 31 ] Moffitt Cancer Center on the USF campus 1980s [ edit ] USF emerged as a major research institution during the 1980s under the leadership of the university's third president John Lott Brown.

[ 32 ] During his tenure, the USF Graduate School was established in 1980.

[ 20 ] In 1986, Brown oversaw the opening of the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute on the USF Tampa campus.

[ 20 ] USF became the first university in the nation to offer a Ph.D. in applied anthropology and the first in the State University System of Florida to offer a degree program in women's studies.

[ 20 ] In January 1988, USF Lakeland opened.

[ 20 ] On February 15, 1988, Francis T. Borkowski was inaugurated as the university's fourth president.

[ 20 ] He served as president for five years, laying the groundwork for the university's football program , establishing on-campus housing for the USF president at the Lifsey House, and merging several colleges into the College of Arts and Sciences.

[ 33 ] 1990s [ edit ] Betty Castor became the university's fifth president and first female president when she was inaugurated in January 1994.

[ 20 ] She served as USF president for six years until 1999. During this time, USF grew to be one of the largest universities in the nation in terms of enrollment.

[ 20 ] In 1997, the university began its inaugural season of NCAA football.

[ 20 ] The Florida Board of Regents named USF a "Research 1" University in 1998.

[ 20 ] 2000s [ edit ] Judy Genshaft was selected as the new president in 2000. Under Genshaft's leadership, the university emerged as a top research university (achieving "preeminence" per the Florida Board of Governors in June 2018) and major economic engine with an annual economic impact of $3.7 billion in the 2018–2019 fiscal year, her last year as president.

[ 11 ] [ 34 ] In 2006, Castor returned to USF to lead the Dr. Kiran C. Patel Center for Global Solutions ; [ 35 ] she stepped down in 2009.

[ 36 ] The university expanded its global reach, opening the first Confucius Institute in Florida in 2008 and creating the Genshaft/Greenbaum Passport Scholarship Fund in 2011, which provides financial support to USF students who want to study abroad.

[ 20 ] Under Genshaft, USF has continuously been ranked among the top veteran-friendly universities in the country.

[ 10 ] In 2009, USF became the first university in the nation to partner with the United States Department of Veterans Affairs to offer specialized services for veterans taking advantage of the new G.I. Bill .

[ 20 ] USF continues to improve academically, being ranked among the best colleges in the nation by U.S. News & World Report .

[ 10 ] 2010s [ edit ] In 2012, USF was recognized as one of the nation's largest producers of Fulbright Program scholars.

[ 10 ] The university closed its Confucius Institute in 2018, citing falling enrollment, misalignment with the university's research focus, and possible consequences on US-government funding to USF.

[ 37 ] In 2018, Genshaft announced her retirement from position as president of USF.

[ 38 ] The university's seventh president, Dr. Steven C. Currall , took office on July 1, 2019.

[ 20 ] Under his leadership, the university broke into the top 50 best public colleges in the nation according to rankings by U.S. News & World Report , achieving a 44th-place ranking in 2019 [ 39 ] 2020s [ edit ] Currall led the university through the COVID-19 pandemic , which included budgetary hardships brought by a loss in state funding (including a controversial proposal to phase out the College of Education - later dropped due to fierce opposition).

[ 40 ] On July 19, 2021, Currall announced his retirement as president, citing "health and family reasons." He remained on the faculty of the Muma College of Business .

[ 41 ] After Currall's resignation, Rhea Law , a USF alumna and former USF Board of Trustees chair, was appointed as interim president.

[ 42 ] The Board of Trustees selected Law for the permanent job as president on March 22, 2022, and she is the first USF graduate to serve in the role.

[ 43 ] Law stated her top priorities were for USF to reach a top-25 public university ranking, to gain admission into the Association of American Universities , and to build an on-campus football stadium.

[ 44 ] USF was accepted into the AAU in 2023.

[ 45 ] In 2025, the university established the Bellini College of Artificial Intelligence, Cybersecurity, and Computing following a $40 million donation from Arnie and Lauren Bellini , the largest donation in USF's history.

[ 46 ] The Bellini College offers eight undergraduate and advanced degree programs, including master's and doctoral degrees.

[ 47 ] [ 46 ] Seal and colors [ edit ] In 1958, President John Allen commissioned a seal for the new university, wanting a symbol that would represent education on a global scale. USF's original colors were green, gold, and purple. These are also the colors of the Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity, of which President Allen was a member. Purple was later dropped and the official colors became just green and gold, but purple accents are visible on some of the older buildings on campus including the administration building which now bears the name of John Allen and his wife, Grace. Purple has since returned as a tertiary color for the university, though it has very limited use aside from some of the women's sports teams having purple accents featured on their alternate jerseys.

[ 48 ] [ 49 ] Preeminence [ edit ] In 2018, USF was classified as the third Preeminent university in Florida by the state university system.

[ 50 ] For a public institution to achieve a status of preeminence, they must meet or surpass benchmarks in at least 11 of 12 metrics set forth by Florida lawmakers.

[ 51 ] Leadership [ edit ] USF is a member institution of the State University System of Florida (SUSF), which is overseen by the Florida Board of Governors .

[ 52 ] Like all SUSF institutions, USF has a 13-member decision-making body called the Board of Trustees (BOT), consisting of the Faculty Senate President, Student Body President, six members appointed by the Governor of Florida , and five members appointed by the Florida Board of Governors .

[ 53 ] [ 54 ] The members appointed by the Governor and Board of Governors must be confirmed by the Florida Senate and each serve five-year terms.

[ 54 ] The BOT has many responsibilities, including setting the school's budget, strategic goals and objectives, and establishing policies related to academic programs. The USF BOT also appoints the USF president, who also serves as the chancellor of the Tampa campus and in turn appoints the chancellors of the St. Petersburg and Sarasota-Manatee campuses.

[ 55 ] USF is currently led by Rhea Law, who was appointed as interim president following the retirement of Steven C. Currall in August 2021, then selected for the permanent role in March 2022.

[ 42 ] [ 43 ] The chancellor of the St. Petersburg campus is Christian Hardigree and the chancellor of the Sarasota-Manatee campus is Karen Holbrook .

Before being consolidated into one university geographically distributed, the University of South Florida System included three member institutions: USF Tampa (which was the flagship campus), USF St. Petersburg , and USF Sarasota-Manatee .

[ 55 ] Each institution was separately accredited, had a distinct mission, and its own strategic plans.

[ 55 ] The USF System once included three other member institutions: one in Fort Myers , one in Lakeland , and a second Sarasota campus.

USF Fort Myers opened in 1982 and closed in 1997 with the opening of Florida Gulf Coast University .

[ 58 ] [ 59 ] The Sarasota institution was originally a private college called New College which sold itself to USF in 1975 to pay off debt, and became New College of the University of South Florida.

[ 60 ] As part of the deal, New College was allowed to keep its unique grading system .

[ 60 ] It shared a campus with USF Sarasota-Manatee, which opened in 1975, but was accredited differently as USFSM was considered a branch campus rather than a member institution at the time. New College became the independent New College of Florida in 2001, but continued to share a campus with USFSM until a new one was built for USFSM in 2006.

USF Lakeland opened in 1988 and split off from the USF System in 2012 to become the independent Florida Polytechnic University .

[ 61 ] In summer 2020, the system was consolidated into "one university geographically distributed" [ 62 ] The 212-foot tall water tower is one of the tallest structures on USF's Tampa campus Tampa campus [ edit ] Established in 1956, the USF Tampa campus serves more than 41,000 students.

[ 63 ] The institution houses 14 colleges and is the doctoral granting campus of USF. The University of South Florida Office of Graduate Studies is based on the Tampa campus and serves as the center of leadership for graduate education at the University of South Florida.

[ 64 ] The Tampa campus is located in North Tampa east of the University neighborhood , about seven miles north of downtown . It is by far the largest of the three campuses, spanning 1,562 acres.

[ 5 ] The campus is divided into different districts, with most housing located in the northeast, athletics and recreation in the east and southeast, research in the south and southwest, USF Health in the west, northwest and north, and undergraduate classes and student services in central campus.

[ 65 ] Each college is divided into its own section within the district, for example with fine and performing arts in the north and northwest parts of the district, social sciences in the east, natural sciences and engineering in the south, and education and business in the southeast.

The campus is known for having over 19,000 trees, and has been named a Tree Campus USA by the Arbor Day Foundation every year since 2011.

[ 66 ] In honor of this, nearly all streets on campus are named after trees, as are six of the 14 dorms. The tree motif is also seen on USF's ceremonial mace , which has a gold pinecone on the top to symbolize both growth and the fact that the first trees to be planted on the campus were pine.

[ 67 ] These pine trees are still around today, in the field next to the main south entrance to the campus on LeRoy Collins Boulevard between Fowler Avenue and Alumni Drive.

St. Petersburg campus [ edit ] Main article: University of South Florida St. Petersburg USF first occupied the site of the USF St. Petersburg campus in 1965, taking over the former U.S. Maritime Training Center along Bayboro Harbor in downtown St. Petersburg .

[ 20 ] [ 29 ] It is located next to Albert Whitted Airport and less than a mile from the Salvador Dalí Museum and Al Lang Stadium . USFSP was a satellite campus from 1965 until 2006, when it was accredited as a separate entity from the USF Tampa campus within the University of South Florida System by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools .

[ 68 ] USFSP serves approximately 4,500 students per year and offers 33 undergraduate and graduate programs in arts and sciences, business, and education.

[ 63 ] Sarasota-Manatee campus [ edit ] Main article: University of South Florida Sarasota-Manatee When USF Sarasota-Manatee was established as a branch campus in 1975, it originally shared a campus with what is now the independent New College of Florida , but was at the time a USF system member called New College of the University of South Florida.

[ 69 ] New College became independent of the USF system in 2001 and USFSM took its place as a member institution in the USF system, but USFSM and New College continued to share a campus until a new campus was completed for USFSM across the street in 2006.

[ 70 ] Nearly 2,000 students take classes at USFSM each year. The campus offers 43 academic programs and certificates in arts and sciences, business, education, and hospitality and technology leadership.

[ 182 ] [ 183 ] [ 184 ] [ 185 ] [ 186 ] Despite the numerous individual, relay, and team national championships in rifle, men's swimming, and women's swimming, the university no longer sponsors any of these sports.

[ 187 ] [ 188 ] [ 189 ] In non-NCAA sanctioned varsity sports, the USF softball team won the American Softball Association National Championships in 1983 and 1984. This was the highest level of college softball at the time as the NCAA didn't start sponsoring the sport until 1985. The Bulls sailing team won the 2009 Inter-Collegiate Sailing Association Sloop National Championship and the 2016 and 2017 ICSA Offshore Large Boats National Championships.

[ 190 ] [ 191 ] As of the 2024 Summer Olympics , 20 USF alumni representing 13 countries have competed as athletes in the Olympic Games .

Évelyne Viens of Canada's women's soccer team became the first USF alum to win an Olympic medal as an athlete when Team Canada won gold in 2020; though other USF alumni such as Ken Eriksen won medals as coaches before this.

[ 201 ] The facility has also played host to a number of outside events including sports and entertainment events such as WWE ThunderDome , consumer shows, religious services, conventions, rodeos, youth sports camps, gymnastics and cheerleading competitions, lectures, and political rallies.

[ 202 ] The venue is also one of the top concert spots in the Tampa Bay region, having hosted musicians like Elton John , Florence and the Machine , Frank Sinatra , Heart , Sting , and more.

[ 204 ] The stadium is located 13 miles away from the Tampa campus and has a capacity of more than 75,000 people, making it the largest in the American Conference, but seating for most games is limited to the lower bowl, cutting capacity to around 45,000. The student section at Raymond James is the largest in the conference with over 12,000 seats.

[ 204 ] Corbett Stadium [ edit ] The USF men's and women's soccer teams play at Corbett Stadium on the main campus in Tampa.

[ 208 ] In addition to supporting USF varsity athletic teams during sporting events, the spirit squads themselves compete at the national level.

[ 208 ] Both the all-girl and co-ed teams regularly rank among the best in the country, with the co-ed team winning the UCA Division I-A national championship in 2021, 2022 and 2023 and the all-girl team winning the title in 2024.

[ 209 ] [ 210 ] Rocky the Bull first began as a toy idea for the USF Bookstore in 1965.

[ 23 ] Today's version Rocky was unveiled in 2003.

[ 23 ] As the official mascot for USF, Rocky the Bull can be seen at USF Athletic events, as well as other major university and community events.

[ 208 ] The USF Herd of Thunder consists of several bands, including a 370-member marching band, pep band, show band, and winter guard.

[ 211 ] The marching band performs at all home and some away USF football games.

[ 211 ] The pep band, called the Herd of Thunder Rumble Pep Band, performs at all home men's and women's basketball and volleyball games, plus conference and NCAA tournament games in some other sports when applicable.
