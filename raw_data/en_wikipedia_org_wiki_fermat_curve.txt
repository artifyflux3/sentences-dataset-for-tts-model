{\displaystyle X^{n}+Y^{n}=Z^{n}.\ } Therefore, in terms of the affine plane its equation is: x n + y n = 1.

{\displaystyle x^{n}+y^{n}=1.\ } An integer solution to the Fermat equation would correspond to a nonzero rational number solution to the affine equation, and vice versa. But by Fermat's Last Theorem it is now known that (for n > 2) there are no nontrivial integer solutions to the Fermat equation; therefore, the Fermat curve has no nontrivial rational points.

The Fermat curve is non-singular and has genus : ( n − − 1 ) ( n − − 2 ) / 2.

{\displaystyle (n-1)(n-2)/2.\ } This means genus 0 for the case n = 2 (a conic ) and genus 1 only for n = 3 (an elliptic curve ). The Jacobian variety of the Fermat curve has been studied in depth. It is isogenous to a product of simple abelian varieties with complex multiplication .

The Fermat curve also has gonality : n − − 1.

{\displaystyle n-1.\ } Fermat varieties [ edit ] Fermat-style equations in more variables define as projective varieties the Fermat varieties .
