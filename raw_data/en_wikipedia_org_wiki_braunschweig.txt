In 2024, it had a population of 272,417. The  Braunschweig-Wolfsburg-Salzgitter region had 1.02 million residents including the cities Wolfsburg and Salzgitter , it is the second largest urban center in Lower Saxony after Hanover . The urban agglomeration of Braunschweig had a population of 551,000 with almost 45% having a migration background , making it the most diverse urban agglomeration in the whole state . The city consists of 37.5% immigrants (approximately 102,000) with a high amount of migrants coming from other European countries , Asia and Africa . 73% of the Germans residing in Braunschweig come from different parts of the country, particularly North Rhine Westphalia , Hessen and the former states of East Germany .

[ 6 ] Braunschweig is considered a metropolis and a regiopolis . It is one of the largest regiopolitan cities in Northern Germany and the largest regiopolis in Lower Saxony. The city is seen as a major hub within the region due to it having multiple characteristics of a metropolitan city in a smaller scale or in a comparative amount to other metropolitan cities in Germany.

57.9% or 111.32 km² of the city's area is made up of greenspaces such as parks and forests . Braunschweig has a population density of 3,371 per km² excluding the green areas because only about 80.8 km² of the total area is properly urban, making it quite a dense city.

[ 7 ] Many districts of the city have a density over 3,600 people per square kilometer such as Weststadt, Innenstadt, Westliches Ringgebiet, Nordstadt, or Östliches Ringgebiet. Due to the city's limited urban core and efforts in preserving green spaces, 81% of the residential buildings are multi-storey apartments limiting 74% of the flats with a space below 100 square meters.

[ 8 ] The city is constructing more residential areas within city limits so that by 2030 the population increases over 20%.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] A powerful and influential centre of commerce in medieval Germany, Brunswick was a member of the Hanseatic League from the 13th until the 17th century. It was the capital city of three successive states: the Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel (1269–1432, 1754–1807, and 1813–1814), the Duchy of Brunswick (1814–1918), and the Free State of Brunswick (1918–1946).

Today, Brunswick is the second-largest city in Lower Saxony and a major centre of scientific research and development.

[ 12 ] History [ edit ] See also: Timeline of Braunschweig Dankwarderode Castle Foundation and early history [ edit ] The date and circumstances of the town's foundation are unknown. Tradition maintains that Brunswick was created through the merger of two settlements, one founded by Brun(o) , a Saxon count who died in 880, on one side of the River Oker – the legend gives the year 861 for the foundation – and the other the settlement of a legendary Count Dankward , after whom Dankwarderode Castle (the "Castle of Dankward's clearing"), which was reconstructed in the 19th century, is named.

[ 13 ] [ 14 ] The town's original name of Brunswik may be a combination of the name Bruno and Low German wik (related to the Latin vicus ), a place where merchants rested and stored their goods. The town's name, therefore, may indicate a resting place, consistent with its location by a ford across the Oker River. An alternative explanation of the city's name is that it comes from Brand , or burning, indicating a place which developed after the landscape was cleared through burning.

[ 15 ] The city was first mentioned in documents from the St. Magni Church from 1031, which give the city's name as Brunesguik .

[ 14 ] Middle Ages and early modern period [ edit ] Brunswick in the 16th century, from the Civitates orbis terrarum by Georg Braun and Frans Hogenberg [ 16 ] Brunswick Cathedral , St. Blasius, with lion statue Up to the 12th century, Brunswick was ruled by the Saxon noble family of the Brunonids ; then, through marriage, the town fell to the House of Welf . In 1142, Henry the Lion of the House of Welf became duke of Saxony and made Braunschweig the capital of his state (which, from 1156 on, also included the Duchy of Bavaria ). He turned Dankwarderode Castle, the residence of the counts of Brunswick , into his own Pfalz and developed the city further to represent his authority. Under Henry's rule, the Cathedral of St. Blasius was built and he also had the statue of a lion, his heraldic animal, erected in front of the castle. The lion subsequently became the city's landmark.

[ citation needed ] Henry the Lion became so powerful that he dared to refuse military aid to the Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa , which led to his banishment in 1182. Henry went into exile in England. He had previously established ties to the English crown in 1168, through his marriage to King Henry II of England 's daughter Matilda , sister of Richard the Lionheart .

[ 17 ] However, Henry's son Otto , who regained influence and was eventually crowned Holy Roman Emperor , continued to foster the city's development.

[ citation needed ] During the Middle Ages , Brunswick was an important center of trade, one of the economic and political centers in Northern Europe and a member of the Hanseatic League from the 13th century to the middle of the 17th century.

[ 18 ] By the year 1600, Brunswick was the seventh largest city in Germany.

[ 19 ] Although formally one of the residences of the rulers of the Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg , a constituent state of the Holy Roman Empire , Brunswick was de facto ruled independently by a powerful class of patricians and the guilds throughout much of the Late Middle Ages and the Early modern period . Because of the growing power of Brunswick's burghers , the Princes of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel , who ruled over one of the subdivisions of Brunswick-Lüneburg, finally moved their Residenz out of the city and to the nearby town of Wolfenbüttel in 1432.

[ 20 ] The Princes of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel did not regain control over the city until the late 17th century, when Rudolph Augustus, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg , took the city by siege.

[ 21 ] In the 18th century Brunswick was not only a political, but also a cultural centre. Influenced by the philosophy of the Enlightenment , dukes like Anthony Ulrich and Charles I became patrons of the arts and sciences. In 1745, Charles I founded the Collegium Carolinum , predecessor of the Brunswick University of Technology , and in 1753 he moved the ducal residence back to Brunswick. With this he attracted poets and thinkers such as Lessing , Leisewitz , and Jakob Mauvillon to his court and the city.

[ 22 ] Emilia Galotti by Lessing and Goethe 's Faust were performed for the first time in Brunswick.

[ 23 ] 19th century [ edit ] Landschaftliches Haus , Landtag building of the Duchy and the Free State of Brunswick In 1806, the city was captured by the French during the Napoleonic Wars and became part of the short-lived Napoleonic Kingdom of Westphalia in 1807. The exiled Duke Frederick William raised a volunteer corps, the Black Brunswickers , who fought the French in several battles.

[ 24 ] After the Congress of Vienna in 1815, Brunswick was made capital of the re-established independent Duchy of Brunswick , later a constituent state of the German Empire from 1871. In the aftermath of the July Revolution in 1830, in Brunswick duke Charles II was forced to abdicate. His absolutist governing style had previously alienated the nobility and bourgeoisie , while the lower classes were disaffected by the bad economic situation. During the night of 7–8 September 1830, the ducal palace in Brunswick was stormed by an angry mob, set on fire, and destroyed completely.

[ 25 ] Charles was succeeded by his brother William VIII . During William's reign, liberal reforms were made and Brunswick's parliament was strengthened.

[ 26 ] During the 19th century, industrialisation caused a rapid growth of population in the city, eventually causing Brunswick to be for the first time significantly enlarged beyond its medieval fortifications and the River Oker.

[ 27 ] On 1 December 1838, the first section of the Brunswick–Bad Harzburg railway line connecting Brunswick and Wolfenbüttel opened as the first railway line in Northern Germany, operated by the Duchy of Brunswick State Railway .

[ 28 ] [ 29 ] Early to mid-20th century [ edit ] Braunschweig around 1900 Braunschweig in the early hours of 15 October 1944 On 8 November 1918, at the end of World War I , a socialist workers' council forced Duke Ernest Augustus to abdicate.

[ 30 ] [ 31 ] On 10 November, the council proclaimed the Socialist Republic of Brunswick under one-party government by the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (USPD); however, the subsequent Landtag election on 22 December 1918 was won by the Majority Social Democratic Party of Germany (MSPD), and the USPD and MSPD formed a coalition government .

[ 32 ] An uprising in Braunschweig in 1919, led by the communist Spartacus League , was defeated when Freikorps troops under Georg Ludwig Rudolf Maercker took over the city on order of the German Minister of Defence, Gustav Noske .

[ 33 ] [ 34 ] An MSPD-led government was subsequently established; in December 1921, a new constitution was approved for the Free State of Brunswick , now a parliamentary republic within the Weimar Republic , again with Braunschweig as its capital.

[ 35 ] After the Landtag election of 1930, Brunswick became the second state in Germany where the Nazis participated in government, when the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP) formed a coalition government with several conservative and right-wing parties.

[ 36 ] With the support of Dietrich Klagges , Brunswick's minister of the interior, the NSDAP organized a large SA rally in Braunschweig. On 17–18 October 1931, 100,000 SA stormtroopers marched through the city; street fights between Nazis, socialists, and communists left several dead or injured.

[ 37 ] On 25 February 1932, the state of Brunswick granted Adolf Hitler German citizenship to allow him to run in the 1932 German presidential election .

[ 38 ] In Braunschweig, Nazis carried out several attacks on political enemies, with the acquiescence of the state government.

[ 39 ] After the Nazi seizure of power in 1933, several state institutions were placed in Braunschweig, including the Luftfahrtforschungsanstalt in Völkenrode , the Hitler Youth Academy for Youth Leadership , [ 40 ] and the SS - Junkerschule Braunschweig .

[ 41 ] With the Reichswerke Hermann Göring in Salzgitter and the Stadt des KdF-Wagens , as well as several factories in the city itself (including Büssing and the Volkswagenwerk Braunschweig ), the Braunschweig region became one of the centres of the German arms industry .

[ 42 ] During the Second World War , Braunschweig was a sub-area headquarters of Wehrkreis XI (one of Germany's military districts), [ 43 ] and was the garrison city of the 31st Infantry Division that took part in the invasions of Poland, Belgium, and France, largely being destroyed during its retreat following the invasion of Russia.

[ citation needed ] In this period, thousands of Eastern workers were brought to the city as forced labor , [ 44 ] and in the 1943–1945 period at least 360 children taken away from such workers died in the Entbindungsheim für Ostarbeiterinnen ("Maternity Ward for Eastern Workers").

[ 45 ] In 1944, two subcamps of the Neuengamme concentration camp were established in Braunschweig. The subcamp Schillstraße or Büssing-NAG/Schillstraße , located where the BraWo Park's parking lot is today, held about 800 male prisoners, who were forced to work in the arms production at Büssing-NAG . After about 300 had died due to disease, hunger, and maltreatment over the course of just a few months, a further 200 were transferred to the infirmary of a nearby subcamp in early January 1945 in order to reduce the number of deaths. However, this was only effective to some degree, as another 80 bodies landed in the city's crematory until the subcamp's closing in March 1945, when Büssing-NAG had to halt production due to severe bombing damages.

[ 46 ] [ 47 ] [ 48 ] Today the Gedenkstätte Schillstraße , located very close to the former premises of the subcamp, documents Braunschweig's history during the Third Reich .

[ 48 ] [ 49 ] Büssing-NAG also had another subcamp in the nearby Vechelde , which held a further 400 male prisoners.

[ 50 ] [ 51 ] The subcamp SS-Reitschule , named so as it was located on the former premises of the SS-Junker School 's riding school, held approximately 800 prisoners, all female, who were tasked with clearing away rubble. This subcamp was commissioned by the city of Braunschweig. Although it was only open for two months - from December 1944 until February 1945, there were at least 17 deaths and a transfer of about 50 prisoners to a nearby subcamp's infirmary. The number of survivors is unknown.

[ 52 ] [ 53 ] Piera Sonnino (1922–1999), an Italian author, writes of her imprisonment in Braunschweig in her book, This Has Happened , published in English in 2006 by MacMillan Palgrave.

[ citation needed ] The Allied air raid on October 15, 1944, destroyed most of the city's churches, and the Altstadt (old town), the largest homogeneous ensemble of half-timbered houses in Germany.

[ 54 ] 100 out of 800 half-timbered houses survived as well as the most important places and streets, preserved in 5 areas of the old town.

[ 55 ] [ 56 ] The city's cathedral, which had been converted to a Nationale Weihestätte (national shrine) by the Nazi government, still stood.

[ 57 ] Postwar period to the 21st century [ edit ] About 10% of the inner city survived Allied bombing and remain to represent its distinctive architecture.

[ 58 ] The cathedral was restored to its function as a Protestant church.

[ 59 ] Outside the old town city centre large historic quarters remain like Östliches Ringgebiet with its Gründerzeit architecture.

Politically, after the war, the Free State of Brunswick was dissolved by the Allied occupying authorities , Braunschweig ceased to be a capital, and most of its lands were incorporated in the newly formed state of Lower Saxony .

[ 60 ] During the Cold War , Braunschweig, then part of West Germany , suffered economically due to its proximity to the Iron Curtain . The city lost its historically strong economic ties to what was then East Germany ; for decades, economic growth remained, on average, below the rest of the country while unemployment was above-average for West Germany.

[ 61 ] On 28 February 1974, as part of a district reform in Lower Saxony, the rural district of Braunschweig , which had surrounded the city, was disestablished. The major part of the former district was incorporated into the city of Braunschweig, increasing its population by roughly 52,000 people.

[ 62 ] In the 1990s, efforts increased to reconstruct historic buildings that had been destroyed in the air raid.

[ citation needed ] The façade of the Braunschweiger Schloss was rebuilt, and buildings such as the Alte Waage (originally built in 1534) now stand again.

Braunschweig has a population of 272,000 and is the 2nd largest city in Lower Saxony . Braunschweig is considered as one of the oldest cities in Germany, founded in 1031 by Henry the Lion . Braunschweig first reached its peak of over 100,000 in 1890. In the 1960s and 1970s industrialization boomed in Braunschweig due to automobile and other companies coming to Braunschweig and surrounding cities like Wolfsburg and Salzgitter . Braunschweig's population reached its highest peak of population in 1975 with population of about 273,000 and is expected to exceed this count during the year 2025 and other years. Braunschweig's population started to decline in the 1980s. In the 1990s - after the German reunification - it began to grow again as many East Germans moved there due to its close proximity to former East Germany , 75% of the Germans living in Braunschweig come from different parts of Germany; most are from Former East Germany , Hessen and North Rhine Westphalia . Currently, Braunschweig has a strong focus on research and development. According to 2019 data, it has the highest R&D intensity (ratio of R&D expenditure to GDP ) in the entire EU and over 4% of all employed people are R&D personnel.

[ 65 ] Religion [ edit ] In 2015, 91,785 people (or 36.3% of the population) were Protestant and 34,604 (13.7%) people were Roman Catholic ; 126,379 people (50.0%) either adhered to other denominations or followed no religion.

[ 66 ] Islam [ edit ] Roughly 27,000 Muslims (9.8% of the population)
were in Braunschweig during 2024. Mosques like DMK Moschee, Fatih Moschee Braunschweig and cultural clubs are present throughout the city but mosque buildings with minerates have not been built in Braunschweig but can be seen in its urban area for example the Grüne Moschee in Wolfenbüttel, Fatih Moschee Salzgitter and the Albanischer-Kulturverein in Gifhorn. The region had around 95,000 to 105,000 Muslims, accounting to approximately 10% of the total region's population.

Salzgitter Fatih Moschee Immigration [ edit ] Largest group of foreigners in Braunschweig as of 2024.

A total of 102,156 of Braunschweig's residents, including citizens with second passport , had a migration background in 2024 (37.5% of the total population). People from over 175 nations live in Braunschweig, contributing to its cosmopolitan atmosphere and demographics. Among the 37.5% of people with a migration background, 26% or 70,828 were Non-German citizens or Germans with a second passport but without a migration background [ 67 ] . A high proportion of foreigners in the city come from Asia and Africa , something not seen in many cities in a similar size range. One of the main asylums , for refugees and asylum seekers, of Lower Saxony is located in Braunschweig as well as multiple smaller asylums are present throughout the city too, contributing to a higher amount of migrants and refugees in the city compared to other parts of the state though a high number of them are not counted as residents.

[ 68 ] The city's universities and interest in increasing the number of families from foreign countries has led to a higher trend in immigration. Braunschweig has had a relatively stable population because of multiple housing restrictions and other factors but many Germans are leaving the city so in order to take up their spaces, many foreigners are coming to the city. Multiple residential areas are being constructed in order to withstand the high inflow of migrants to the city.

By the year 2030 , over 44% of the population in Braunschweig is projected to have a foreign background, this includes first and second generation foreigners and naturalized foreigners due to around 51% of the population below 18 having foreign ancestry and high immigration rate. The population is also expected to increase by 20% by the year 2030 from 2020.

[ 11 ] Weststadt has the highest migration percentage of all districts being 63.2%, followed by Nordstadt-Schunteraue with 55.8%, Westliches Ringgebiet with 52.4% and Mitte with 49.6%.

From other European countries, there are 38,734 residents with majority of the people coming from Poland (13.365), Russia (8.278), Italy (3.630) and Ukraine (3.462).

15,398 people with African descent live in the city.
Majority are from Cameroon (2.233), Tunisia (2.215), Algeria (1.207), Ghana (1.100) and Nigeria (871).

The combined population of residents with descent from both Americas is 4,233 with the two most common nations present being Brazil (786) and Colombia (713).

Urban agglomeration [ edit ] The urban agglomeration area of Braunschweig is approximately 551,000 in 2024, making it one of the largest regiopolis in Germany and the largest one in Lower Saxony . This area includes Wolfenbüttel , Meine ,  northern parts of Salzgitter , Weddel , Sickte , Timmerlah , Lengede and other towns and regions within a 15 kilometer radius though Salzgitter is an exception being 20 kilometers away. The field area and green spaces are not counted because a high amount of the areas are not registered. Braunschweig's urban area makes it a bigger city compared to others with a similar size e.g.

Aachen , Wiesbaden or Gelsenkirchen , and since the urban area is not significantly smaller than Hanover , it makes itself an important and major city in Lower Saxony . Companies like New Yorker , Salzgitter AG , Jägermeister , Siemens , Bosch , Volkswagen , Nordzucker , Continental , Kosatec [ de ] and others are headquartered or have a branch in this area.

The metropolitan population of Braunschweig is 1.66 million and is considered as Region Braunschweig , including cities and towns such as Wolfsburg, Goslar or Gifhorn, which is the further range of Braunschweig and is not the same as the smaller ranged urban aggomeration.
The metropolitan region of Braunschweig is a subdivision of the larger Metropolregion Hannover-Braunschweig-Göttingen-Wolfsburg .

[ 69 ] [ 70 ] [ 76 ] [ 77 ] This makes the agglomeration one of the most diverse in Germany and the most in Lower Saxony . Over 70% of the Germans in the urban agglomeration come from different parts of Germany with most of them coming from eastern States due to the proximity. The city is unique because unlike most cities with immigrant populations concentrated inside the city itself, higher number of migrant populations are also found in surrounding areas.

Name [ edit ] See also: Brunswick (disambiguation) Many other geographical locations around the world are named Brunswick, after the historical English name of Braunschweig. Between 1714 and 1837, the House of Hanover ruled Great Britain in personal union with the Electorate of Hanover . The House of Hanover was formally known as the House of Brunswick-Lüneburg , Hanover line.

[ 94 ] As a result, many places in the British colonies were named after Brunswick, such as the province of New Brunswick in Canada.

[ 95 ] Ironically, the city of Braunschweig was not ruled by the Hanoverians while its name was being given to other Brunswicks around the world. Starting in 1269, the Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg underwent a series of divisions and mergers, with parts of the territory being transferred between various branches of the family. The city of Braunschweig went to the senior branch of the house, the Wolfenbüttel line , while Lüneburg eventually ended up with the Hanover line . Although the territory had been split, all branches of the family continued to style themselves as the House of Brunswick-Lüneburg.

[ 94 ] [ 96 ] In 1884, the senior branch of the House of Welf became extinct. The Hanover line, being the last surviving line of the family, subsequently held the throne of the Duchy of Brunswick from November 1913 until November 1918.

The game had been brought to Germany by the local school teacher Konrad Koch , also the first to write down a German version of the rules of football , [ nb 1 ] who organized the first match between pupils from his school Martino-Katharineum in 1874.

[ 115 ] The 2011 German drama film Lessons of a Dream is based on Koch.

Eintracht Braunschweig also fields a successful women's field hockey team that claimed nine national championship titles between 1965 and 1978. In the past, the club also had first or second-tier teams in the sports of ice hockey , field handball , and water polo .

The New Yorker Lions (formerly Braunschweig Lions) are the city's American football team, winning a record number of 12 German Bowl titles, as well as five Eurobowls (a shared record).

The city's professional basketball team, the Basketball Löwen Braunschweig , plays in the Basketball Bundesliga , the highest level in Germany. The Löwen's predecessor SG Braunschweig had previously played in the Bundesliga as well. Eintracht Braunschweig's women's basketball team plays in the 2. Damen-Basketball-Bundesliga [ de ] , the second tier of women's basketball in Germany.

In handball , MTV Braunschweig , the city's oldest sports club (founded in 1847), plays in the semi-professional 3. Liga .

Other sports clubs from Braunschweig that play or have played at the Bundesliga or 2nd Bundesliga level include Spot Up 89ers [ de ] ( baseball ), Braunschweiger THC [ de ] (field hockey), SV Süd Braunschweig [ de ] (handball), Rugby-Welfen Braunschweig ( rugby union ), and USC Braunschweig [ de ] ( volleyball ).

Annual sporting events held in Braunschweig include the international equestrian tournament Löwen Classics , Rund um den Elm , Germany's oldest road bicycle race , [ 116 ] and the professional tennis tournament Sparkassen Open .
