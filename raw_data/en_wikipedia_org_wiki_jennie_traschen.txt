She is a professor of physics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst .

Education and career [ edit ] Traschen took three years to graduate from Averill Park High School in Rensselaer, New York , in 1974. She went to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute with the support of a National Merit Scholarship and New York State Regent's Scholarship , [ 1 ] graduating in 1977.

[ 2 ] She traveled to the University of Cambridge on a Churchill Scholarship for the Mathematical Tripos , and earned a master's degree there. She returned to the US for doctoral study in general relativity at Harvard University , earning her Ph.D. in 1984.

[ 2 ] She became a faculty member at Amherst after postdoctoral research at the University of Chicago and University of California, Santa Barbara .

[ 2 ] Research [ edit ] Traschen's research has included work with Robert Geroch critiquing certain approximations used in string theory [ 3 ] and defining a "maximally reasonable" class of Pseudo-Riemannian manifolds called the Geroch–Traschen metrics.

[ 4 ] In black hole cosmology , Traschen is known for her work with David Kastor on multi-black-hole solutions to the equations of general relativity.

[ 5 ] She is also known for her work in cosmological perturbation theory , on integral constraint vectors of spacelike hypersurfaces.

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] Professional recognition [ edit ] In 2006, Traschen was named a Fellow of the American Physical Society (APS), after a nomination from the APS Division of Gravitational Physics, "for her ground-breaking contributions to early universe cosmology and black hole physics".

[ 8 ] Political activism [ edit ] In 2001, Traschen became infamous nationally for her suggestion at a meeting of the Amherst, Massachusetts select board that money from a fund for veteran services that had been used to purchase US flags would have been better spent on education and health care for veterans.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] The unfortunate timing of her remarks, the day before the September 11 attacks , and the inflammatory wording of her statement, led her to become a national "target of harassment and hate".

[ 10 ] Traschen has also worked to encourage more women to enter theoretical physics, by organizing workshops aimed at greater inclusiveness [ 11 ] and decrying the phenomenon in which some contributors to joint research are seen as invisible or negligible and excluded from recognition.

[ 2 ] [ 11 ] Family and personal life [ edit ] Traschen is the daughter of Isadore "Ike" Traschen, [ 1 ] a professor of literature at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and a leader in protests against the Vietnam War at Rensselaer.

[ 12 ] She is married to David Kastor, also a physicist at UMass Amherst. Their daughter, Kalyani Kastor, [ 13 ] is a professional illustrator.
