It is the second-most populous city in Florida with a population of 442,241 at the 2020 census , [ 6 ] while the Miami metropolitan area in South Florida has an estimated 6.46 million residents and is the third-largest metropolitan area in the Southeast and sixth-largest metropolitan area in the United States.

[ 9 ] Miami has the third-largest skyline in the U.S. with over 300 high-rises , [ 11 ] 70 of which exceed 491 ft (150 m).

[ 12 ] It is the county seat of Miami-Dade County .

Miami is a major center and leader in finance, commerce, culture, arts, and international trade.

[ 13 ] [ 14 ] Miami's metropolitan area is by far the largest urban economy in Florida, with a 2017 gross domestic product of $344.9 billion.

[ 15 ] In a 2018 UBS study of 77 world cities, Miami was the third-richest city in the U.S. and the third-richest globally in purchasing power .

[ 16 ] Miami is a majority-minority city with a Hispanic and Latino population of 310,472, or 70.2 percent of the city's population, as of 2020.

[ 17 ] Downtown Miami has among the largest concentrations of international banks in the U.S. and is home to several large national and international companies.

[ citation needed ] The Health District is home to several major University of Miami -affiliated hospital and health facilities, including Jackson Memorial Hospital , the nation's largest hospital with 1,547 beds, [ 18 ] and the Miller School of Medicine , the University of Miami's academic medical center and teaching hospital, and others engaged in health-related care and research.

PortMiami , the city's seaport, is the busiest cruise port in the world in both passenger traffic and cruise lines.

[ 19 ] The Miami metropolitan area is the second-most visited city or metropolitan statistical area in the U.S. after New York City , with over four million visitors in 2022.

[ 20 ] Due to its strong commercial and cultural ties to Latin America and majority- Hispanic population (at 70%), Miami has been called the "Gateway to Latin America" or even the "Capital of Latin America." [ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ] Toponymy Miami was named after the Miami River , derived from Mayaimi , the historic name of Lake Okeechobee and the Native Americans who lived around it.

[ 24 ] Miami is sometimes colloquially referred to as The 305 , Magic City , Gateway to the Americas , Gateway to Latin America , Capital of Latin America , [ 1 ] and Vice City .

See also: National Register of Historic Places listings in Miami In 1896, approximately 400 men gathered in the building pictured on the left and voted to incorporate Miami.

A 1962 map of Miami The mouth of Miami River at Brickell Key in February 2010 The Tequesta tribe occupied the Miami area for around 2,000 years before contact with Europeans. A village of hundreds of people, dating to 500–600 BCE, was located at the mouth of the Miami River . It is believed that the entire tribe migrated to Cuba by the mid-1700s.

[ 25 ] Settlement In 1566, admiral Pedro Menéndez de Avilés , Florida's first governor, claimed the area for Spain . A Spanish mission was constructed one year later. Spain, and briefly Britain , ruled Florida until it ceded it to the United States in 1821. In 1836, the U.S. built Fort Dallas on the banks of the Miami River as part of their development of the Florida Territory and their attempt to suppress and remove the Seminoles . As a result, the Miami area became a site of fighting in the Second Seminole War .

Founding Miami is noted as the only major city in the United States founded by a woman.

Julia Tuttle , a local citrus grower and a wealthy Cleveland native, was the original owner of the land upon which Miami was built.

[ 26 ] In the late 19th century, the area was known as "Biscayne Bay Country", and reports described it as a promising wilderness and "one of the finest building sites in Florida".

[ 27 ] [ 28 ] The Great Freeze of 1894–1895 hastened Miami's growth, as the crops there were the only ones in Florida that survived. Julia Tuttle subsequently convinced railroad tycoon Henry Flagler to extend his Florida East Coast Railway to the region, for which she became known as "the mother of Miami".

[ 29 ] [ 30 ] Miami was officially incorporated as a city on July 28, 1896, with a population of just over 300.

[ 31 ] 20th century See also: Cuban migration to Miami During the early 20th century, migrants from the Bahamas and African-Americans constituted 40 percent of the city's population.

[ 32 ] : 25 When landlords began to rent homes to African-Americans around Avenue J, what would later become NW Fifth Avenue, a gang of white men with torches marched through the neighborhood and warned the residents to move or be bombed.

[ 32 ] : 33 Miami prospered during the 1920s with an increase in population and development in infrastructure as northerners moved to the city. The legacy of Jim Crow was embedded in these developments. Miami's chief of police at the time, H. Leslie Quigg , did not hide the fact that he, like many other white Miami police officers, was a member of the Ku Klux Klan . Unsurprisingly, these officers enforced social codes far beyond the written law. Quigg, for example, "personally and publicly beat a colored bellboy to death for speaking directly to a white woman".

[ 32 ] : 53 [ 33 ] The collapse of the Florida land boom of the 1920s , the 1926 Miami Hurricane , and the Great Depression in the 1930s slowed development. When World War II began, Miami became a base for U.S. defense against German submarines due to its prime location on the southern coast of Florida. This brought an increase in Miami's population; 172,172 people lived in the city by 1940. The city's nickname , The Magic City , came from its rapid growth, which was noticed by winter visitors who remarked that the city grew so much from one year to the next that it was like magic.

[ 34 ] After Fidel Castro rose to power in Cuba following the Revolution in 1959, many wealthy Cubans sought refuge in Miami, further increasing the city's population. Miami's national profile expanded dramatically in the 1970s, particularly in 1972.

[ 35 ] The region hosted both the Democratic and Republican National Conventions in the 1972 Presidential election . The Miami Dolphins also made history with their undefeated "perfect" season . The area's educational and cultural institutions also developed significantly in this period, positioning the city to service a larger and increasingly international population.

[ 35 ] Miami developed new businesses and cultural amenities as part of the New South in the 1980s and 1990s. At the same time, South Florida weathered social problems related to drug wars , immigration from Haiti and Latin America, and the widespread destruction of Hurricane Andrew .

[ 36 ] [ 34 ] Racial and cultural tensions sometimes sparked, but Miami developed in the latter half of the 20th century as a major international, financial, and cultural center. It is the second-largest U.S. city with a Spanish-speaking majority (after El Paso, Texas ), and the largest city with a Cuban-American plurality.

[ 37 ] [ 38 ] Geography Miami and its suburbs are located on a broad plain between the Everglades to the west and Biscayne Bay to the east, which extends from Lake Okeechobee southward to Florida Bay . The elevation of the area averages at around 6 ft (1.8 m) [ 39 ] above sea level in most neighborhoods, especially near the coast. The highest points are found along the Miami Rock Ridge , which lies under most of the eastern Miami metro. The main portion of Miami is on the shores of Biscayne Bay, which contains several hundred natural and artificial barrier islands , the largest of which contains Miami Beach and South Beach . The Gulf Stream , a warm ocean current , runs northward just 15 miles (24 km) off the coast, allowing Miami's climate to stay warm and mild all year.

Geology The surface bedrock under the Miami area is called Miami oolite or Miami limestone. This bedrock is covered by a thin layer of soil, and is no more than 50 feet (15 m) thick. Miami limestone formed as the result of the drastic changes in sea level associated with recent glacial periods , or ice ages . Beginning some 130,000 years ago, the Sangamonian Stage raised sea levels to approximately 25 feet (8 m) above the current level. All of southern Florida was covered by a shallow sea. Several parallel lines of reef formed along the edge of the submerged Florida plateau , stretching from the present Miami area to what is now the Dry Tortugas .

[ 40 ] The area behind this reef line was a large lagoon. Miami limestone formed throughout the area from the deposition of oolites and the shells of bryozoans . Starting about 100,000 years ago, the Wisconsin glaciation began lowering sea levels, exposing the floor of the lagoon. By 15,000 years ago, the sea level had dropped 300 to 350 feet (90 to 110 m) below the current level. The sea level rose quickly after that, stabilizing at the current level about 4,000 years ago, leaving the mainland of South Florida just above sea level .

[ 40 ] Beneath the plain lies the Biscayne Aquifer , a natural underground source of fresh water that extends from southern Palm Beach County to Florida Bay . It comes closest to the surface around the cities of Miami Springs and Hialeah .

[ 41 ] Most of the Miami metropolitan area obtains its drinking water from the Biscayne Aquifer. As a result of the aquifer, it is not possible to dig more than 15 to 20 ft (5 to 6 m) beneath the city without hitting water, which impedes underground construction, though some underground parking garages exist. For this reason, the mass transit systems in and around Miami are elevated or at-grade .

[ 40 ] Most of the western fringes of Miami border the Everglades , a tropical marshland covering most of the southern portion of Florida.

Alligators that live in the marshes have ventured into Miami communities and onto major highways.

The highest natural point in Miami is in Coconut Grove , near Biscayne Bay along the Miami Rock Ridge at 24 feet (7.3 m) above sea level .

[ 42 ] The historic district of Downtown Miami is one of the city's oldest with buildings constructed as far back as 1896.

A map of Miami's neighborhoods Miami is split roughly into north, south, west, and Downtown areas. The heart of the city is Downtown Miami , which is on the eastern side and includes the neighborhoods of Brickell , Virginia Key , Watson Island , and PortMiami . Downtown Miami is Florida's largest and most influential central business district, with many major banks, courthouses, financial headquarters, cultural and tourist attractions, schools, parks, and a large residential population.

Brickell Avenue has the largest concentration of international banks in the United States. Just northwest of Downtown is the Health District , which is Miami's center for hospitals, research institutes and biotechnology , with hospitals such as Jackson Memorial Hospital , Bascom Palmer Eye Institute , and the University of Miami 's Miller School of Medicine .

[ 43 ] The southern side of Miami includes the neighborhoods of Coral Way , The Roads , and Coconut Grove . Coral Way is a historic residential neighborhood built in 1922 between Downtown and Coral Gables , and is home to many old homes and tree-lined streets. Coconut Grove, settled in 1825, and annexed into Miami in 1925, is a historic neighborhood with narrow, winding roads and a heavy tree canopy.

[ 43 ] [ 44 ] It is the location of Miami's City Hall at Dinner Key , the former Coconut Grove Playhouse , CocoWalk , and the Coconut Grove Convention Center . It is home to many nightclubs , bars, restaurants, and bohemian shops, which makes it very popular with local college students . Coconut Grove is known for its many parks and gardens, such as Vizcaya Museum , The Kampong , The Barnacle Historic State Park , and numerous other historic homes and estates.

[ 43 ] The western side of Miami includes the neighborhoods of Little Havana , West Flagler , and Flagami . Although at one time a mostly Jewish neighborhood, today western Miami is home to immigrants from mostly Central America and Cuba . The west central neighborhood of Allapattah is a multicultural community of many ethnicities.

[ 43 ] The northern side of Miami includes Midtown , a district with a great mix of diversity ranging from Caribbeans to Central Americans, South Americans and Europeans. The Edgewater neighborhood of Midtown is mostly composed of high-rise residential towers and is home to the Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts .

Wynwood is an art district with ten galleries in former warehouses, as well as a large outdoor mural project. The wealthier residents of Miami usually live in the Design District and the Upper Eastside , which has many 1920s homes as well as examples of Miami Modern architecture in the MiMo Historic District.

[ 45 ] The northern side of Miami also has notable African-American and Caribbean immigrant communities, including Little Haiti , Overtown (home of the Lyric Theater ), and Liberty City .

[ 43 ] Climate Main article: Climate of Miami A summer afternoon thunderstorm rolling into Miami from the Everglades , July 2006 Miami has a tropical monsoon climate ( Köppen climate classification Am ) [ 46 ] [ 47 ] with hot and wet summers and warm and dry winters.

Miami's sea-level elevation, coastal location, position just above the Tropic of Cancer , and proximity to the Gulf Stream shape its climate. Average winter high temperatures, from December to March, range from 76.4–80.3 °F (24.7–26.8 °C). January is the coolest month with an average daily temperature of 68.2 °F (20.1 °C). Low temperatures fall below 50 °F (10 °C) about 3 to 4 nights during the winter season, [ citation needed ] after the passage of cold fronts that produce what little rainfall that falls in the winter.

There are two basic seasons in Miami, a hot and wet season from May to October, and a warm and dry season from November to April. During the hot and wet season, daily thundershowers occur in the humid unstable air masses. The wet season in Miami is defined as the period during which the average daily dew point temperature is above 70 °F (21 °C). The rainy season typically begins on the first day that occurs, or within a few days later.

[ 48 ] Daily rainfall in Miami decreases sharply when the average daily dew point falls to 70 °F (21 °C) or below. In some years, a stalled front to the south of the Florida peninsula may cause rains to continue for a few more days. From 1956 to 1997, the date summer began ranged from April 16 to June 3, with a median date of May 21. In those same years, the date summer ended ranged from September 24 to November 1, with a median date of October 17.

[ 48 ] During summer, temperatures range from the mid-80s to low 90s °F (29–35 °C) and are accompanied by high humidity. The heat is often relieved in the afternoon by thunderstorms or a sea breeze that develops off the Atlantic Ocean. Much of the year's 61.9 inches (1,572 mm) of rainfall occurs during this period.

Dew points in the warm months range from 71.9 °F (22.2 °C) in June to 73.7 °F (23.2 °C) in August.

[ 49 ] Historical temperature extremes range from 27 °F (−2.8 °C) on February 3, 1917, to 100 °F (38 °C) on July 21, 1942.

[ 50 ] While Miami has never recorded snowfall at any official weather station since records have been kept, snow flurries fell in some parts of Miami on January 19, 1977.

[ 51 ] [ 52 ] [ 53 ] The coldest daytime maximum temperature on record is 45 °F (7 °C) in December 1989 during the December 1989 United States cold wave . The warmest overnight low measured is 84 °F (29 °C) on several occasions.

[ 49 ] Hurricane season officially runs from June 1 to November 30, although hurricanes can develop beyond those dates. The most likely time for Miami to be hit is during the peak of the Cape Verde season, which is mid-August to the end of September.

[ 54 ] Although tornadoes are uncommon in the area, one struck in 1925 and another in 1997 .

[ 55 ] [ 56 ] Around 40% of homes in Miami are built upon floodplains and are considered as flood-risk zones.

[ 57 ] Miami falls within the Department of Agriculture's 10b/11a plant hardiness zone .

[ 58 ] Miami is one of the major coastal cities and major cities in the United States that will be most affected by climate change .

[ 59 ] [ 60 ] Globally, it is one of the most at-risk cities, according to a 2020 report by Resources for the Future .

[ 61 ] [ 62 ] Global sea level rise , which in Miami is projected to be 21 inches (53 cm) to 40 inches (100 cm) by 2070, will lead to an increase in storm damage, more intense flooding, and will threaten Miami's water supply.

[ 63 ] [ 64 ] [ 65 ] Other potential impacts of climate change include higher hurricane wind speeds and severe thunderstorms, which can bring about hail or tornadoes.

[ 62 ] Some protective efforts are in place, including nourishing beaches and adding protective barriers, raising buildings and roads that are vulnerable, and restoring natural habitats such as wetlands .

Despite Miami being home to less than a fourteenth (1/14) of the population of the metro area, it is an outlier compared to its neighbors, being nearly twice the size of the next-largest city in the metro: Hialeah . Miami has approximately a sixth of the population of its own county, Miami-Dade , which is the state's largest.

Miami had rapid growth in the first half of the twentieth century. Its population grew from 1,681 in the 1900 census to 249,276 in the 1950 census . This made it Florida's largest city, a title it retained until the Jacksonville Consolidation , when the city of Jacksonville absorbed most of Duval County , nearly tripling its population. Since then, Miami has retained its spot as Florida's second-largest city.

Throughout the latter half of the twentieth century, Miami experienced a certain amount of stagnation in its population, with expansion slowing during the 1950s and 1960s before nearly halting in the next three decades as suburbanization occurred. Miami grew by 34.3% in the 1950s and 1960s as its population reached 334,859 at the 1970 census . In the next three decades, it only grew 8.2%. By the time of the 2000 census , Miami's population stood at 362,470.

In the 2000s and 2010s, spurred by high-rise construction in Downtown Miami, Edgewater, and Brickell, Miami's population began to grow quickly once more.

[ 78 ] An estimate by the American Community Survey found that the downtown population, from Brickell north to Midtown Miami, grew nearly 40% between 2010 and 2018.

[ 79 ] From 2000 to 2010, Miami's population grew by 10.2% and reached 399,457 in 2010. In the early 2010s, Miami's population crossed a milestone of 400,000 people. In the 2020 census , it had grown by a further 10.7%, up to a population of 442,241.

[ 81 ] Miami's explosive population growth has been driven by internal migration from other parts of the country, up until the 1960s. From 1970 to 2000, population growth in Miami was stagnant, as non-Hispanic White Miamians left and significant immigration from Latin America, particularly Cuba , made up the balance.

[ 82 ] [ 83 ] Miami's Hispanic majority solidified itself in this period of time, and in 1985, Miami elected its first Cuban-born mayor, Xavier Suarez .

The non-Hispanic Black population of the city of Miami peaked in 1990 at almost 90,000, making up nearly a quarter of the population of Miami. Since then, Miami's non-Hispanic Black population has experienced a precipitous and steady decline. In the 2020 census, it was 52,447, only 11.7% of the population. Reasons for this include high costs in areas such as Liberty City and Little Haiti , compounded with gentrification .

[ 84 ] [ 85 ] The non-Hispanic White population began to rebound in the twenty-first century, as the monolithically Hispanic areas in the Western and Central parts of Miami experienced population stagnation. This caused them to begin to be outweighed by migration into the Downtown region, from Latin America and the rest of the United States. This caused the non-Hispanic White population to rise from a nadir of 11.8% at the time of the 2000 census to 11.9% at the time of the 2010 census . After this, the non-Hispanic White population grew significantly faster than Miami as a whole did during the 2010s. In the 2020 census , non-Hispanic Whites were 14.0% of the population of Miami and numbered 61,829, the highest number since the 1980s. The non-Hispanic White population of Miami surpassed the non-Hispanic Black population of Miami in the 2010s.

It incorporates a rhythm and pronunciation heavily influenced by Spanish, where rhythm is syllable-timed .

[ 197 ] This is a native dialect of English, not learner English or interlanguage . It is possible to differentiate this variety from an interlanguage spoken by second-language speakers, in that the "Miami accent" does not generally display the following features: there is no addition of /ɛ/ before initial consonant clusters with /s/ , speakers do not confuse /dʒ/ with /j/ , (e.g., Yale with jail ), and /r/ and /rr/ are pronounced as alveolar approximant [ ɹ ] instead of alveolar tap [ɾ] or alveolar trill [r] in Spanish.

[ 293 ] Expressways and roads Venetian Causeway (left) and MacArthur Causeway (right) connect Downtown and South Beach .

State Road 886 , also known as Port Boulevard, connects Downtown Miami and PortMiami over Biscayne Bay .

Miami's road system is based along the numerical Miami grid where Flagler Street forms the east–west baseline and Miami Avenue forms the north–south meridian . The corner of Flagler Street and Miami Avenue is in the middle of Downtown in front of the Downtown Macy's (formerly the Burdine's headquarters). The Miami grid is primarily numerical so that, for example, all street addresses north of Flagler Street and west of Miami Avenue have "NW" in their address. Because its point of origin is in Downtown, which is close to the coast, the "NW" and "SW" quadrants are much larger than the "SE" and "NE" quadrants. Many roads, especially major ones, are also named (e.g., Tamiami Trail/SW 8th St ), although, with exceptions, the number is in more common usage among locals.

With few exceptions, within this grid north–south roads are designated as Courts, Roads, Avenues or Places (often remembered by their acronym), while east–west roads are streets, Terraces, Drives or occasionally Ways. Major roads in each direction are located at one mile intervals. There are 16 blocks to each mile on north–south avenues, and 10 blocks to each mile on east–west streets. Major north–south avenues generally end in "7" – e.g., 17th, 27th, 37th/Douglas Aves., 57th/Red Rd., 67th/Ludlam, 87th/Galloway, etc., all the way west beyond 177th/Krome Avenue. One prominent exception is 42nd Avenue, LeJeune Road, located at the half-mile point instead.

Major east–west streets to the south of Downtown are multiples of 16, though the beginning point of this system is at SW 8th St, one half-mile south of Flagler ("zeroth") Street. Thus, major streets are at 8th St., 24th St./Coral Way, 40th St./Bird, 56th/Miller, 72nd/ Sunset, 88th/N. Kendall, 104th (originally S. Kendall), 120th/Montgomery, 136th/Howard, 152nd/Coral Reef, 168th/Richmond, 184th/Eureka, 200th/Quail Roost, 216th/Hainlin Mill, 232nd/Silver Palm, 248th/Coconut Palm, etc., well into the 300s. Within the grid, odd-numbered addresses are generally on the north or east side, and even-numbered addresses are on the south or west side.

All streets and avenues in Miami-Dade County follow the Miami grid, with a few exceptions, most notably in Coral Gables , Hialeah , Coconut Grove and Miami Beach . One neighborhood, The Roads , is named as such because its streets run off the Miami grid at a 45-degree angle, and therefore are all named roads.

Miami-Dade County is served by four Interstate Highways ( I-75 , I-95 , I-195 , I-395 ) and several U.S. Highways including U.S. Route 1 , U.S. Route 27 , U.S. Route 41 , and U.S. Route 441 .

Metrorail connects the urban western suburbs of Hialeah , Medley , and inner-city Miami with suburban The Roads , Coconut Grove , Coral Gables , South Miami , and urban Kendall via the central business districts of Miami International Airport , the Health District , and Downtown. A free, elevated people mover , Metromover , operates 21 stations on three different lines in greater Downtown Miami, with a station at roughly every two blocks of Downtown and Brickell. Several expansion projects are being funded by a transit development sales tax surcharge throughout Miami-Dade County.

[ 298 ] Tri-Rail , a commuter rail system operated by the South Florida Regional Transportation Authority (SFRTA), runs from Miami International Airport northward to West Palm Beach , making eighteen stops throughout Miami-Dade , Broward , and Palm Beach counties.

Phase I of MiamiCentral Station was completed in 2012, and the Tri-Rail part of Phase II was completed in 2015, but the construction of the Amtrak part remains delayed.

Two new light rail systems, Baylink and the Miami Streetcar, have been proposed and are currently in the planning stage. BayLink would connect Downtown with South Beach , and the Miami Streetcar would connect Downtown with Midtown .

Miami is the southern terminus of Amtrak 's Atlantic Coast services, running two lines, the Silver Meteor and the Silver Star , both terminating in New York City.
