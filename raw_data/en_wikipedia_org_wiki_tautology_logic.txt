In [mathematical logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_logic "Mathematical logic"), a **tautology** (from [Ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_language "Ancient Greek language"): ταυτολογία) is a [formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-formed_formula "Well-formed formula") that is true regardless of the interpretation of its component [terms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Term_(logic) "Term (logic)"), with only the [logical constants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_constant "Logical constant") having a fixed meaning. For example, a formula that states "the ball is green or the ball is not green" is always true, regardless of what a ball is and regardless of its colour. Tautology is usually, though not always, used to refer to valid formulas of [propositional logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositional_logic "Propositional logic").

The philosopher [Ludwig Wittgenstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Wittgenstein "Ludwig Wittgenstein") first applied the term to redundancies of [propositional logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositional_logic "Propositional logic") in 1921, borrowing from [rhetoric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetoric "Rhetoric"), where a [tautology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tautology_(rhetoric) "Tautology (rhetoric)") is a repetitive statement. In logic, a formula is [satisfiable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisfiability_and_validity "Satisfiability and validity") if it is true under at least one interpretation, and thus a tautology is a formula whose negation is unsatisfiable. In other words, it cannot be false.

Unsatisfiable statements, both through negation and affirmation, are known formally as [contradictions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contradiction "Contradiction"). A formula that is neither a tautology nor a contradiction is said to be [logically contingent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contingency_(philosophy) "Contingency (philosophy)"). Such a formula can be made either true or false based on the values assigned to its propositional variables.

The [double turnstile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_turnstile "Double turnstile") notation ![Image 1: {\displaystyle \vDash S}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9510f7d1d521313f9fc7f632c62fd6ec528553d8) is used to indicate that _S_ is a tautology. Tautology is sometimes symbolized by "V _pq_", and contradiction by "O _pq_". The [tee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee_(symbol) "Tee (symbol)") symbol ![Image 2: {\displaystyle \top }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/cf12e436fef2365e76fcb1034a51179d8328bb33) is sometimes used to denote an arbitrary tautology, with the dual symbol ![Image 3: {\displaystyle \bot }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f282c7bc331cc3bfcf1c57f1452cc23c022f58de) ([falsum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsum "Falsum")) representing an arbitrary contradiction; in any symbolism, a tautology may be substituted for the truth value "[true](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_truth "Logical truth")", as symbolized, for instance, by "1".[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tautology_(logic)#cite_note-1)

Tautologies are a key concept in [propositional logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositional_logic "Propositional logic"), where a tautology is defined as a propositional formula that is true under any possible [Boolean valuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_valuation "Boolean valuation") of its [propositional variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositional_variable "Propositional variable").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tautology_(logic)#cite_note-:0-2) A key property of tautologies in propositional logic is that an [effective method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_method "Effective method") exists for testing whether a given formula is always satisfied (equiv., whether its negation is unsatisfiable).

The definition of tautology can be extended to sentences in [predicate logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predicate_logic "Predicate logic"), which may contain [quantifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantification_(logic) "Quantification (logic)")—a feature absent from sentences of propositional logic. Indeed, in propositional logic, there is no distinction between a tautology and a [logically valid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_(logic) "Validity (logic)") formula. In the context of predicate logic, many authors define a tautology to be a sentence that can be obtained by taking a tautology of propositional logic, and uniformly replacing each propositional variable by a first-order formula (one formula per propositional variable). The set of such formulas is a [proper subset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_subset "Proper subset") of the set of logically valid sentences of predicate logic (i.e., sentences that are true in every [model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_(mathematical_logic) "Structure (mathematical logic)")).

An example of a tautology is "it's either a tautology, or it isn't."

The word tautology was used by the ancient Greeks to describe a statement that was asserted to be true merely by virtue of saying the same thing twice, a [pejorative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pejorative "Pejorative") meaning that is still used for [rhetorical tautologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tautology_(rhetoric) "Tautology (rhetoric)"). Between 1800 and 1940, the word gained new meaning in logic, and is currently used in [mathematical logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_logic "Mathematical logic") to denote a certain type of propositional formula, without the pejorative connotations it originally possessed.

In 1800, [Immanuel Kant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant "Immanuel Kant") wrote in his book _Logic_:

> The identity of concepts in analytical judgments can be either _explicit_ (_explicita_) or _non-explicit_ (_implicita_). In the former case analytic propositions are _tautological._

Here, _analytic proposition_ refers to an [analytic truth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_truth#Logical_truths_and_analytic_truths "Logical truth"), a statement in natural language that is true solely because of the terms involved.

In 1884, [Gottlob Frege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottlob_Frege "Gottlob Frege") proposed in his _Grundlagen_ that a truth is analytic exactly if it can be derived using logic. However, he maintained a distinction between analytic truths (i.e., truths based only on the meanings of their terms) and tautologies (i.e., statements devoid of content).

In his _[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tractatus\_Logico-Philosophicus "Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus")_ in 1921, Ludwig Wittgenstein proposed that statements that can be deduced by logical deduction are tautological (empty of meaning), as well as being analytic truths. [Henri Poincaré](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Poincar%C3%A9 "Henri Poincaré") had made similar remarks in _[Science and Hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science\_and\_Hypothesis "Science and Hypothesis")_ in 1905. Although [Bertrand Russell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell "Bertrand Russell") at first argued against these remarks by Wittgenstein and Poincaré, claiming that mathematical truths were not only non-tautologous but were [synthetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_truth "Synthetic truth"), he later spoke in favor of them in 1918:

> Everything that is a proposition of logic has got to be in some sense or the other like a tautology. It has got to be something that has some peculiar quality, which I do not know how to define, that belongs to logical propositions but not to others.

Here, _logical proposition_ refers to a proposition that is provable using the laws of logic.

Many logicians in the early 20th century used the term 'tautology' for any formula that is universally valid, whether a formula of [propositional logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositional_logic "Propositional logic") or of [predicate logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_logic "First-order logic"). In this broad sense, a tautology is a formula that is true under all [interpretations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretation_(logic) "Interpretation (logic)"), or that is logically equivalent to the negation of a contradiction. [Tarski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Tarski "Alfred Tarski") and [Gödel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_G%C3%B6del "Kurt Gödel") followed this usage and it appears in textbooks such as that of Lewis and Langford.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tautology_(logic)#cite_note-3) This broad use of the term is less common today, though some textbooks continue to use it.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tautology_(logic)#cite_note-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tautology_(logic)#cite_note-5)

Modern textbooks more commonly restrict the use of 'tautology' to valid sentences of propositional logic, or valid sentences of predicate logic that can be reduced to propositional tautologies by substitution.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tautology_(logic)#cite_note-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tautology_(logic)#cite_note-7)

Propositional logic begins with **propositional variables**, atomic units that represent concrete propositions. A **formula** consists of propositional variables connected by logical connectives, built up in such a way that the truth of the overall formula can be deduced from the truth or falsity of each variable. A **valuation** is a function that assigns each propositional variable to either T (for truth) or F (for falsity). So by using the propositional variables _A_ and _B_, the binary connectives ![Image 4: {\displaystyle \lor }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ab47f6b1f589aedcf14638df1d63049d233d851a) and ![Image 5: {\displaystyle \land }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d6823e5a222eb3ca49672818ac3d13ec607052c4) representing [disjunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction "Logical disjunction") and [conjunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_conjunction "Logical conjunction") respectively, and the unary connective ![Image 6: {\displaystyle \lnot }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/099107443792f5fec9bebe39b919a690db7198c1) representing [negation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negation "Negation"), the following formula can be obtained:![Image 7: {\displaystyle (A\land B)\lor (\lnot A)\lor (\lnot B)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4f2d45f06cee4d4881219449c0b0a73fefab5654).

A valuation here must assign to each of _A_ and _B_ either T or F. But no matter how this assignment is made, the overall formula will come out true. For if the first disjunct ![Image 8: {\displaystyle (A\land B)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ebdcd2d1d13bc1f915aa141415965509a4e2b4f1) is not satisfied by a particular valuation, then _A_ or _B_ must be assigned F, which will make one of the following disjunct to be assigned T. In natural language, either both A and B are true or at least one of them is false.

Definition and examples
-----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tautology_(logic)&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Definition and examples")]

A formula of propositional logic is a _tautology_ if the formula itself is always true, regardless of which valuation is used for the [propositional variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositional_variable "Propositional variable"). There are infinitely many tautologies.

In many of the following examples _A_ represents the statement "object _X_ is bound", _B_ represents "object _X_ is a book", and C represents "object _X_ is on the shelf". Without a specific referent object _X_, ![Image 9: {\displaystyle A\to B}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d5b8dd84619daff17b52a08b77d15db2b9ad6c2a) corresponds to the proposition "all bound things are books".

*   ![Image 10: {\displaystyle (A\lor \lnot A)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ab553b5d4656bafd558a2dc86a152fd94965f5f0) ("_A_ or not _A_"), the [law of excluded middle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_excluded_middle "Law of excluded middle"). This formula has only one propositional variable, _A_. Any valuation for this formula must, by definition, assign _A_ one of the truth values _true_ or _false_, and assign ![Image 11: {\displaystyle \lnot }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/099107443792f5fec9bebe39b919a690db7198c1)_A_ the other truth value. For instance, "The cat is black or the cat is not black".
*   ![Image 12: {\displaystyle (A\to B)\Leftrightarrow (\lnot B\to \lnot A)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/098f044d01ad9910ab70cd46e545a8903e50c454) ("if _A_ implies _B_, then not-_B_ implies not-_A_", and vice versa), which expresses the law of [contraposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraposition "Contraposition"). For instance, "If it's bound, it is a book; if it's not a book, it's not bound" and vice versa.
*   ![Image 13: {\displaystyle ((\lnot A\to B)\land (\lnot A\to \lnot B))\to A}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0f4a6d0f98e002706de264a485f925aedf33ede9) ("if not-_A_ implies both _B_ and its negation not-_B_, then not-_A_ must be false, then _A_ must be true"), which is the principle known as _[reductio ad absurdum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio\_ad\_absurdum "Reductio ad absurdum")_. For instance, "If it's not bound, we know it's a book, if it's not bound, we know it's also not a book, so it is bound".
*   ![Image 14: {\displaystyle \lnot (A\land B)\Leftrightarrow (\lnot A\lor \lnot B)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c524422701e12217f3b51cb7a4b5ebfe54ed12b7) ("if not both _A_ and _B_, then not-_A_ or not-_B_", and vice versa), which is known as [De Morgan's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Morgan%27s_law "De Morgan's law"). "If it is not both a book and bound, then we are sure that it's not a book or that it's not bound" and vice versa.
*   ![Image 15: {\displaystyle ((A\to B)\land (B\to C))\to (A\to C)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/72953ec90cee0d9be9b936f5622727a28913a239) ("if _A_ implies _B_ and _B_ implies _C_, then _A_ implies _C_"), which is the principle known as [hypothetical syllogism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothetical_syllogism#Propositional_logic "Hypothetical syllogism"). "If it's bound, then it's a book and if it's a book, then it's on that shelf, so if it's bound, it's on that shelf".
*   ![Image 16: {\displaystyle ((A\lor B)\land (A\to C)\land (B\to C))\to C}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d7043a8c9880f868c508c655566fd9fb9c62eb59) ("if at least one of _A_ or _B_ is true, and each implies _C_, then _C_ must be true as well"), which is the principle known as [proof by cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_by_cases "Proof by cases"). "Bound things and books are on that shelf. If it's either a book or it's bound, it's on that shelf".

A minimal tautology is a tautology that is not the instance of a shorter tautology.

Verifying tautologies
---------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tautology_(logic)&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Verifying tautologies")]

The problem of determining whether a formula is a tautology is fundamental in propositional logic. If there are _n_ variables occurring in a formula then there are 2 _n_ distinct valuations for the formula. Therefore, the task of determining whether or not the formula is a tautology is a finite and mechanical one: one needs only to evaluate the [truth value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_value "Truth value") of the formula under each of its possible valuations. One algorithmic method for verifying that every valuation makes the formula to be true is to make a [truth table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_table "Truth table") that includes every possible valuation.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tautology_(logic)#cite_note-:0-2)

For example, consider the formula

![Image 17: {\displaystyle ((A\land B)\to C)\Leftrightarrow (A\to (B\to C)).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/cce8248fb6011325b512bf3355e488b106dd5136)
There are 8 possible valuations for the propositional variables _A_, _B_, _C_, represented by the first three columns of the following table. The remaining columns show the truth of subformulas of the formula above, culminating in a column showing the truth value of the original formula under each valuation.

| ⁠![Image 18: {\displaystyle A}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3)⁠ | ⁠![Image 19: {\displaystyle B}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/47136aad860d145f75f3eed3022df827cee94d7a)⁠ | ⁠![Image 20: {\displaystyle C}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4fc55753007cd3c18576f7933f6f089196732029)⁠ | ![Image 21: {\displaystyle A\land B}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/74954195333a8593163b93a9688695b8dc74da55) | ![Image 22: {\displaystyle (A\land B)\to C}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/58fecede545555ce1607458f802a4f8ccb9accf7) | ![Image 23: {\displaystyle B\to C}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a9febe2010e6933c5e384a066ef7d5f634b97a7e) | ![Image 24: {\displaystyle A\to (B\to C)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b2b33f36f729c9aa2cfdadb0b7d6b58580818228) | ![Image 25: {\displaystyle ((A\land B)\to C)\Leftrightarrow (A\to (B\to C))}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b161ccc7e428dd923128dae00e2c4268a9382ba0) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| T | T | T | T | T | T | T | T |
| T | T | F | T | F | F | F | T |
| T | F | T | F | T | T | T | T |
| T | F | F | F | T | T | T | T |

| F | T | F | F | T | F | T | T |
| F | F | T | F | T | T | T | T |
| F | F | F | F | T | T | T | T |

Because each row of the final column shows _T_, the sentence in question is verified to be a tautology.

It is also possible to define a [deductive system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_system "Deductive system") (i.e., proof system) for propositional logic, as a simpler variant of the deductive systems employed for first-order logic (see Kleene 1967, Sec 1.9 for one such system). A proof of a tautology in an appropriate deduction system may be much shorter than a complete truth table (a formula with _n_ propositional variables requires a truth table with 2 _n_ lines, which quickly becomes infeasible as _n_ increases). Proof systems are also required for the study of [intuitionistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuitionistic_logic "Intuitionistic logic") propositional logic, in which the method of truth tables cannot be employed because the law of the excluded middle is not assumed.

Tautological implication
------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tautology_(logic)&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Tautological implication")]

A formula _R_ is said to **tautologically imply** a formula _S_ if every valuation that causes _R_ to be true also causes _S_ to be true. This situation is denoted ![Image 26: {\displaystyle R\models S}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6d49ddd79c8ada52cf08db64070fc134cfbd2b1a). It is equivalent to the formula ![Image 27: {\displaystyle R\to S}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/499bc5e6b1153b43ba86d31780bc215f01aa0bf1) being a tautology (Kleene 1967 p.27).

For example, let _![Image 28: {\displaystyle S}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest\_v1/media/math/render/svg/4611d85173cd3b508e67077d4a1252c9c05abca2)_ be ![Image 29: {\displaystyle A\land (B\lor \lnot B)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/60255d5b706f8baaee19318cfce4af5e376b0e3e). Then _![Image 30: {\displaystyle S}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest\_v1/media/math/render/svg/4611d85173cd3b508e67077d4a1252c9c05abca2)_ is not a tautology, because any valuation that makes _![Image 31: {\displaystyle A}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest\_v1/media/math/render/svg/7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3)_ false will make _![Image 32: {\displaystyle S}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest\_v1/media/math/render/svg/4611d85173cd3b508e67077d4a1252c9c05abca2)_ false. But any valuation that makes _![Image 33: {\displaystyle A}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest\_v1/media/math/render/svg/7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3)_ true will make _![Image 34: {\displaystyle S}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest\_v1/media/math/render/svg/4611d85173cd3b508e67077d4a1252c9c05abca2)_ true, because ![Image 35: {\displaystyle B\lor \lnot B}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/99886f848ae93c75408b416dff4580494edd2523) is a tautology. Let _![Image 36: {\displaystyle R}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest\_v1/media/math/render/svg/4b0bfb3769bf24d80e15374dc37b0441e2616e33)_ be the formula ![Image 37: {\displaystyle A\land C}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/70bb9844880566f77e0ea00f8a17ed569d8d1726). Then ![Image 38: {\displaystyle R\models S}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6d49ddd79c8ada52cf08db64070fc134cfbd2b1a), because any valuation satisfying _![Image 39: {\displaystyle R}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest\_v1/media/math/render/svg/4b0bfb3769bf24d80e15374dc37b0441e2616e33)_ will make _![Image 40: {\displaystyle A}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest\_v1/media/math/render/svg/7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3)_ true—and thus makes _![Image 41: {\displaystyle S}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest\_v1/media/math/render/svg/4611d85173cd3b508e67077d4a1252c9c05abca2)_ true.

It follows from the definition that if a formula _![Image 42: {\displaystyle R}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest\_v1/media/math/render/svg/4b0bfb3769bf24d80e15374dc37b0441e2616e33)_ is a contradiction, then _![Image 43: {\displaystyle R}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest\_v1/media/math/render/svg/4b0bfb3769bf24d80e15374dc37b0441e2616e33)_ tautologically implies every formula, because there is no truth valuation that causes _![Image 44: {\displaystyle R}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest\_v1/media/math/render/svg/4b0bfb3769bf24d80e15374dc37b0441e2616e33)_ to be true, and so the definition of tautological implication is trivially satisfied. Similarly, if _![Image 45: {\displaystyle S}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest\_v1/media/math/render/svg/4611d85173cd3b508e67077d4a1252c9c05abca2)_ is a tautology, then _![Image 46: {\displaystyle S}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest\_v1/media/math/render/svg/4611d85173cd3b508e67077d4a1252c9c05abca2)_ is tautologically implied by every formula.

There is a general procedure, the **substitution rule**, that allows additional tautologies to be constructed from a given tautology (Kleene 1967 sec. 3). Suppose that S is a tautology and for each propositional variable A in S a fixed sentence S A is chosen. Then the sentence obtained by replacing each variable A in S with the corresponding sentence S A is also a tautology.

For example, let S be the tautology:

![Image 47: {\displaystyle (A\land B)\lor \lnot A\lor \lnot B}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0de2fd72960eadc32257afb75315594108ff8cab).
Let S A be ![Image 48: {\displaystyle C\lor D}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c85b67fc743ea47c72219cc96329ea364997c82b) and let S B be ![Image 49: {\displaystyle C\to E}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/27f24bf52b3555e18537a3f41044ed0f74af8b75).

It follows from the substitution rule that the sentence:

![Image 50: {\displaystyle ((C\lor D)\land (C\to E))\lor \lnot (C\lor D)\lor \lnot (C\to E)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4eebb1522e6ab842a8cae370e61d2857532ab2e5)
is also a tautology.

Semantic completeness and soundness
-----------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tautology_(logic)&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Semantic completeness and soundness")]

An [axiomatic system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiomatic_system "Axiomatic system") is [complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Completeness_(logic) "Completeness (logic)") if every tautology is a theorem (derivable from axioms). An axiomatic system is [sound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundness "Soundness") if every theorem is a tautology.

Efficient verification and the Boolean satisfiability problem
-------------------------------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tautology_(logic)&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Efficient verification and the Boolean satisfiability problem")]

The problem of constructing practical algorithms to determine whether sentences with large numbers of propositional variables are tautologies is an area of contemporary research in the area of [automated theorem proving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_theorem_proving "Automated theorem proving").

The method of [truth tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_tables "Truth tables") illustrated above is provably correct – the truth table for a tautology will end in a column with only _T_, while the truth table for a sentence that is not a tautology will contain a row whose final column is _F_, and the valuation corresponding to that row is a valuation that does not satisfy the sentence being tested. This method for verifying tautologies is an [effective procedure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_procedure "Effective procedure"), which means that given unlimited computational resources it can always be used to mechanistically determine whether a sentence is a tautology. This means, in particular, the set of tautologies over a fixed finite or countable alphabet is a [decidable set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decidable_set "Decidable set").

As an [efficient procedure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient_procedure "Efficient procedure"), however, truth tables are constrained by the fact that the number of valuations that must be checked increases as 2 _k_, where _k_ is the number of variables in the formula. This exponential growth in the computation length renders the truth table method useless for formulas with thousands of propositional variables, as contemporary computing hardware cannot execute the algorithm in a feasible time period.

The problem of determining whether there is any valuation that makes a formula true is the [Boolean satisfiability problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem "Boolean satisfiability problem"); the problem of checking tautologies is equivalent to this problem, because verifying that a sentence _S_ is a tautology is equivalent to verifying that there is no valuation satisfying ![Image 51: {\displaystyle \lnot S}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/25d8e529dce6b478e956c5a52a56b35bd403929a). The Boolean satisfiability problem is [NP-complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-complete "NP-complete"), and consequently, tautology is [co-NP-complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-NP-complete "Co-NP-complete"). It is widely believed that (equivalently for all NP-complete problems) no [polynomial-time algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial-time_algorithm "Polynomial-time algorithm") can solve the satisfiability problem, although some algorithms perform well on special classes of formulas, or terminate quickly on many instances.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tautology_(logic)#cite_note-8)

Tautologies versus validities in first-order logic
--------------------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tautology_(logic)&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Tautologies versus validities in first-order logic")]

The fundamental definition of a tautology is in the context of propositional logic. The definition can be extended, however, to sentences in [first-order logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_logic "First-order logic").[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tautology_(logic)#cite_note-9) These sentences may contain quantifiers, unlike sentences of propositional logic. In the context of first-order logic, a distinction is maintained between _logical validities_, sentences that are true in every model, and _tautologies_ (or, _tautological validities_), which are a proper subset of the first-order logical validities. In the context of propositional logic, these two terms coincide.

A tautology in first-order logic is a sentence that can be obtained by taking a tautology of propositional logic and uniformly replacing each propositional variable by a first-order formula (one formula per propositional variable). For example, because ![Image 52: {\displaystyle A\lor \lnot A}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/42bc39c90e40298464f5f82377cb9e7ed52e938f) is a tautology of propositional logic, ![Image 53: {\displaystyle (\forall x(x=x))\lor (\lnot \forall x(x=x))}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/dbd2ba6fe297ec4eca0ea94051d19189b7e25b83) is a tautology in first order logic. Similarly, in a first-order language with a unary relation symbols _R_,_S_,_T_, the following sentence is a tautology:

![Image 54: {\displaystyle (((\exists xRx)\land \lnot (\exists xSx))\to \forall xTx)\Leftrightarrow ((\exists xRx)\to ((\lnot \exists xSx)\to \forall xTx)).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4430d0257beea1747560863b478044ded886d411)
It is obtained by replacing ![Image 55: {\displaystyle A}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3) with ![Image 56: {\displaystyle \exists xRx}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1a4d4a873b7094fbd05698877ee33d16eff96532), ![Image 57: {\displaystyle B}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/47136aad860d145f75f3eed3022df827cee94d7a) with ![Image 58: {\displaystyle \lnot \exists xSx}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8f0badf19c8ba7ecd1d930556e4cc1cfa67374dc), and ![Image 59: {\displaystyle C}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4fc55753007cd3c18576f7933f6f089196732029) with ![Image 60: {\displaystyle \forall xTx}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e87d515ef56ffb2ba34b78014c7b8a450fffe1ca) in the propositional tautology: ![Image 61: {\displaystyle ((A\land B)\to C)\Leftrightarrow (A\to (B\to C))}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b161ccc7e428dd923128dae00e2c4268a9382ba0).

Tautologies in Non-Classical Logics
-----------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tautology_(logic)&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Tautologies in Non-Classical Logics")]

Whether a given formula is a tautology depends on the formal system of logic that is in use. For example, the following formula is a tautology of classical logic but not of [intuitionistic logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuitionistic_logic "Intuitionistic logic"):
