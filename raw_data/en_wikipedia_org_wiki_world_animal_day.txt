World Animal Day is an international day of action for animal rights and welfare celebrated annually on October 4 , the feast day of Francis of Assisi , the patron saint of animals.

The World Animal Day movement is supported and endorsed by a number of celebrities, such as Anneka Svenska , Brian Blessed and Melanie C .

[ 1 ] History [ edit ] Dutch children's drawing competition on the occasion of World Animal Day 1969 World Animal Day, was originated by cynologist Heinrich Zimmermann. He organized the first World Animal Day on March 24, 1925, at the Sport Palace in Berlin , Germany. Over 5,000 people attended this first event.

[ 2 ] The activity was originally scheduled for October 4, to align with the feast day of Saint Francis of Assisi , patron saint of animals. However, the venue was not available on that day. The event was then moved to October 4 for the first time in 1929. Every year, Zimmermann worked tirelessly on the promotion of World Animal Day. Finally, in May 1931 at a congress of the International Animal Protection Congress in Florence, Italy, his proposal to make October 4 as World Animal Day universal was unanimously accepted and adopted as a resolution.

It is sometimes cited, incorrectly, that World Animal Day started in 1931 at the convention of ecologists in Florence , Italy, who wished to highlight the plight of endangered species.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] In 1948, Australian celebrations were organised by the RSPCA . According to The Examiner , the construction of a boarding home for dogs was scheduled and a donation had been received from the L.G.R.C.

[ 5 ] Since 2002, The Finnish Association of Animal Protection Associations (SEY) has organized various events during the Animal Week and distributed material to schools.

[ 6 ] On October 27, 2006, the Polish parliament adopted a resolution on the establishment of 4 October as Animal Day.

[ 7 ] In Argentina , this day has been observed on April 29 since 1908, promoted by Ignacio Lucas Albarracín, president of the Animal Protection Association of Buenos Aires . Coincidentally Albarracín would die on the same date in 1926, making it a day to also pay tribute to him for pioneering the animal's rights movement in the country.

[ 8 ] Since 2003, World Animal Day has been coordinated by UK based animal welfare charity, Naturewatch Foundation with a new World Animal Day website launched for the 2023 celebration.

Many countries such as Bolivia , Bahamas , China , and Colombia have community driven annual events to promote the global celebration.

[ 9 ] Annual Themes [ edit ] Starting in 2018, Naturewatch Foundation has included specific themes in the day's celebration.

[ 10 ] Year Theme 2018 Celebrating human relationship with the bigger and better animal kingdom 2019 Life below water bodies: for the people and the planet 2020 Man and Dog 2021 Forest and Livelihoods: Sustaining People and Planet 2022 Shared Planet 2023 Great or small, love them all 2024 The world is their home too See also [ edit ] Blessing of animals International Primate Day Monkey Day World Wildlife Day References [ edit ] ^ "World Animal Day 2021: Theme, History, Significance, Quotes, Celebration" .
