[ 1 ] Career [ edit ] McCandless began his career writing for video gaming and computer magazines such as Your Sinclair , PC Zone , and PC Format from the late 1980s until the early 2000s. In 1995, McCandless published the trivia-based book TrekMaster (based on Star Trek ).

[ 2 ] After the 1990s, he went on to work for The Guardian and Wired .

McCandless eventually created the visual blog Information Is Beautiful , followed by a book of the same name. Early explorations into the synergy between data visualisation and his work as a journalist led to the development of Information Is Beautiful and the subsequent publication of his book of the same name (titled A Visual Miscellaneum in the United States).

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] Since the publication of Information Is Beautiful in 2009, his information design work has appeared in numerous publications, including The Guardian, Wired , and Die Zeit , and has also been showcased at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Wellcome Trust gallery in London, and at the Tate Britain .

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] Another book, Knowledge Is Beautiful , was published in 2014. It was followed by Beautiful News in 2023.
