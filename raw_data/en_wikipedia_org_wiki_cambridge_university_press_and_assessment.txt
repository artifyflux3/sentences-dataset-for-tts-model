[ 13 ] The main changes to Statute J were to replace references to the University Press with references to the merged entity under the title of the Press and Assessment Department, and to update the name of the Press Syndicate to the Press and Assessment Syndicate.

[ 14 ] The two founding organisations have an entwined history, since December 1858 when Cambridge University Press first printed exam papers for Cambridge Assessment.

Updates from the syndicate are published by the official newspaper of the University of Cambridge, The Reporter .
