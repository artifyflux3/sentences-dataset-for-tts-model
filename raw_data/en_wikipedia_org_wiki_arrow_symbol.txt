Advertising billboards in Okazaki , Japan, featuring many different arrow symbols An arrow is a graphical symbol , such as ←, ↑ or →, or a pictogram , used to point or indicate direction. In its simplest form, an arrow is a triangle , chevron , or concave kite , usually
affixed to a line segment or rectangle , [ 1 ] and in more complex forms a representation of an actual arrow (e.g. ➵ U+27B5). The direction indicated by an arrow is the one along the length of the line or rectangle toward the single pointed end.

History [ edit ] An older (medieval) convention is the manicule (pointing hand, ☚).

Pedro Reinel in c.

1505 first used the fleur-de-lis as indicating north in a compass rose ; 
the convention of marking the eastern direction with a cross is older (medieval).

[ 2 ] Use of the arrow symbol does not appear to pre-date the 18th century. An early arrow symbol is found in an illustration of Bernard Forest de Bélidor 's treatise L'architecture hydraulique , printed in France in 1737. The arrow is here used to illustrate the direction of the flow of water and of the water wheel's rotation. At about the same time, arrow symbols were used to indicate the flow of rivers in maps.

[ 3 ] A trend toward abstraction, in which the arrow's fletching is removed, can be observed in the mid-to-late 19th century. The arrow can be seen in the work of Paul Klee . In a further refinement of the symbol, John Richard Green's A Short History of the English People of 1874 contained maps by cartographer Emil Reich, which indicated army movements by curved lines, with solid triangular arrowheads placed intermittently along the lines.

[ 4 ] Main usage [ edit ] An exit sign with an arrow to indicate the exit is to the left This section needs expansion . You can help by adding to it .

( July 2019 ) Arrows are universally recognised for indicating directions.

[ 1 ] They are widely used on signage and for wayfinding , [ 1 ] and are often used in road surface markings .
A two-way road may be indicated by "↕" or "⇅".

In mathematics and physics [ edit ] Upward arrows are often used to indicate an increase in a numerical value, and downward arrows indicate a decrease.

In mathematical logic , a right-facing arrow indicates material conditional , and a left-right (bidirectional) arrow indicates if and only if , an upwards arrow indicates the NAND operator (negation of conjunction), an downwards arrow indicates the NOR operator (negation of disjunction).

Use of arrow symbols in mathematical notation developed in the first half of the 20th century.

[ 5 ] David Hilbert in 1922 introduced the arrow symbol representing logical implication . 
The double-headed arrow representing logical equivalence was introduced by Albrecht Becker in Die Aristotelische Theorie der Möglichkeitsschlüsse , Berlin, 1933.

[ 4 ] Knuth's up-arrow notation uses multiple up arrows, such as ⇈, for iterated, or repeated, exponentiation ( tetration ).

The quantum theory of electron spin uses either upward or downward arrows.

A vector may be denoted with an overhead arrow, such as in x → → {\displaystyle {\vec {x}}} or A B ⟶ ⟶ {\textstyle {\stackrel {\longrightarrow }{AB}}} .

Graffiti [ edit ] Arrows are regularly used in contemporary graffiti designs, incorporated as an element in both simplistic tags and complex wildstyle pieces . Arrows are used as a visual technique to make a graffito stand out or give it a sense of movement.

[ 6 ] The graffiti theoretician RAMM:ΣLL:ZΣΣ described adornments, such as arrows, in wildstyle paintings as ornaments that ‘armed’ the letters of a piece.

[ 7 ] The Philadelphia graffiti artist Cool Earl began using arrows in 1967, [ 8 ] although the New York graffiti writer SJK 171 may have been the first to do so.

[ 9 ] The graffiti artist Mare139 is known for creating 3D sculptures of arrows.
