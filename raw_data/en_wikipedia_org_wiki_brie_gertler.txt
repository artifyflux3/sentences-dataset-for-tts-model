Find sources: "Brie Gertler" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( June 2024 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Gertler has written numerous papers on her research and is a book reviewer. She received a B.A. with high honors in philosophy from Swarthmore College in June 1989 and a M.A. at the University of Pennsylvania three years later.  In June 1997, she was granted a Ph.D. by Brown University .

Gertler first found employment as an assistant professor at The College of William & Mary , where she worked from 1997 to 2001, before moving on to the University of Wisconsin–Madison , where she earned tenure. She moved to her University of Virginia teaching position in 2004, was later department chair, and added the Vice-Provost title in 2021.

To the thirteenth edition of the Joel Feinberg - and Russ Shafer-Landau -edited Reason & Responsibility , Gertler contributed a paper in support of dualism.  It explored the fundamentals of the mind-body problem and defended her philosophy against charges of "spookiness".  Her argument is founded on the claim that, in feeling pain, we know the essence of the mental state of pain.
