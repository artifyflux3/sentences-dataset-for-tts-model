The Terriers were members of NCAA Division I and participated in the Northeast Conference (NEC) except in two sports that the NEC does not sponsor—men's and women's water polo. The water polo teams respectively competed in the Collegiate Water Polo Association and the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference .

The school's mascot was Rocky the Terrier, who was officially introduced in 1933 by the college's athletic association. Previously the St. Francis's student-athletes were referred to as the Boys from Brooklyn. Notably, the St. Francis Brooklyn men's basketball program was founded in 1896 and was the oldest collegiate program in New York City.

[ 2 ] The basketball, volleyball, water polo, and swimming and diving teams for the Terriers competed in the Generoso Pope Athletic Complex . The soccer teams completed at Brooklyn Bridge Park, Pier 5 .

On March 20, 2023, St. Francis College announced that it would end intercollegiate athletic competition at the close of the spring semester due to financial and enrollment concerns.

[ 3 ] History [ edit ] In 2006, St. Francis College added women's bowling, while dropping men's baseball and women's softball.

[ 4 ] St. Francis College previously sponsored a football team, but was dropped in 1935 .

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] Their last coach was Julius "Indian" Yablok a former quarterback at Colgate University, who replaced Salvatore "Tut" Maggio.

In 2007, Irma Garcia became the athletic director of the Terriers replacing longtime director Edward Aquilone. When hired in 2010, she was the country's only female Latina athletic director in Division I sports.

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] For the 2014–15 academic year, Garcia was named  NACWAA D1 (FCS) Administrator of the Year.

[ 9 ] The award was in part because of the Terriers success in Men's Soccer (NEC Champions and NCAA tournament Participants), Men's Basketball (NEC Regular season Champions and NIT Participants) and Women's Basketball (NEC Champions and NCAA tournament Participants).

Beginning on November 27, 2012, St. Francis College rebranded its athletic programs from St. Francis (NY) to St. Francis Brooklyn.

[ 10 ] The college previously came to be known as St. Francis (NY) when the athletics program joined the Division I Northeast Conference in 1981. In 2018 it was announced that women's soccer [ 11 ] and men's volleyball [ 12 ] would be added as sports programs to the existing teams at St. Francis College. Both teams started play in the 2019–20 school year, with women's soccer starting in fall 2019 and men's volleyball in spring 2020.

On September 30, 2021, the NEC announced it would start a men's volleyball league in the 2023 season (2022–23 school year). The new league was intended to start with SFC as one of six members, [ 13 ] but two more schools were announced as single-sport members before the league began play.

[ 14 ] Before the launch of NEC men's volleyball, SFC had played the 2022 season in the Eastern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association , which it had joined in July 2021.

[ 15 ] On March 20, 2023, the school announced all athletics programs would be terminated at the end of the Spring 2023 semester.  Students on athletic scholarship will be able to keep them until graduation or transfer to another school.

Basketball [ edit ] Both the men's and women's teams hosted their home games at The Pope and were members of the Northeast Conference. The fiercest rival of the Terriers was LIU ; the men's teams have competed since 1928 and the women's teams since 1973.

[ a ] Both the men's and women's Terrier teams played in the Battle of Brooklyn tournament against the Sharks, which was played annually since 1974–75.

[ 18 ] The Terriers also competed against the Wagner Seahawks , and it was referred to as Battle of the Verrazano due to St. Francis College in Brooklyn being separated from Wagner College in Staten Island by the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge . The Battle of the Verrazano dates back to the 1973–74 season.

[ 19 ] The team played its home games on the Peter Aquilone Court at the Generoso Pope Athletic Complex .
