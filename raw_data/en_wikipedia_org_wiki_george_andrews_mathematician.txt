Alma mater Oregon State University ( BS , MA ) University of Pennsylvania ( PhD ) Known for Ramanujan's lost notebook Scientific career Fields Analysis and Combinatorics Institutions Pennsylvania State University Doctoral advisor Hans Rademacher George Eyre Andrews (born December 4, 1938) [ 1 ] is an American mathematician working in special functions , number theory , analysis and combinatorics .

Education and career [ edit ] He is currently an Evan Pugh Professor of Mathematics at Pennsylvania State University .

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] He did his undergraduate studies at Oregon State University [ 2 ] and received his PhD in 1964 at the University of Pennsylvania where his advisor was Hans Rademacher .

[ 1 ] [ 4 ] During 2008–2009 he was president of the American Mathematical Society .

[ 5 ] Contributions [ edit ] Andrews's contributions include several monographs and over 250 research and popular articles on q-series , special functions , combinatorics and applications.

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] He is considered to be the world's leading expert in the theory of integer partitions .

[ 1 ] [ 8 ] In 1976 he discovered Ramanujan 's Lost Notebook .

[ 2 ] He is interested in mathematical pedagogy.

[ 2 ] His book The Theory of Partitions is the standard reference on the subject of integer partitions .

[ 1 ] He has advanced mathematics in the theories of partitions and q-series. His work at the interface of number theory and combinatorics has also led to many important applications in physics.

[ 9 ] Awards and honors [ edit ] In 2003 Andrews was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences .

[ 2 ] He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1997.

[ 10 ] In 1998 he was an Invited Speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Berlin.

[ 11 ] In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society .

[ 12 ] He was given honorary doctorates from the University of Parma in 1998, the University of Florida in 2002, the University of Waterloo in 2004, SASTRA University in Kumbakonam , India in 2012, and University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign in 2014 [ 6 ] [ 13 ] [ 9 ] Publications [ edit ] Selected Works of George E Andrews (With Commentary) (World Scientific Publishing, 2012, ISBN 978-1-84816-666-0 ) Number Theory (Dover, 1994, ISBN 0-486-68252-8 ) The Theory of Partitions (Cambridge University Press, 1998, ISBN 0-521-63766-X ) [ 14 ] Integer Partitions (with Eriksson, Kimmo) (Cambridge University Press, 2004, ISBN 0-521-84118-6 ) [ 15 ] Ramanujan's Lost Notebook: Part I (with Bruce C.
