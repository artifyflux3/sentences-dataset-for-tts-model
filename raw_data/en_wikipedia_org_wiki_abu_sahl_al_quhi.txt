He was from Kuh (or Quh), an area in Tabaristan , Amol , and flourished in Baghdad in the 10th century. He is considered one of the greatest geometers, with many mathematical and astronomical writings ascribed to him.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Engraving of al-Qūhī's perfect compass to draw conic sections Al-Qūhī was the leader of the astronomers working in 988 at the observatory built by the Buwayhid amir Sharaf al-Dawla in Badhdad. He wrote a treatise on the astrolabe in which he solves a number of difficult geometric problems.

In mathematics he devoted his attention to those Archimedean and Apollonian problems leading to equations higher than the second degree . He solved some of them and discussed the conditions of solvability. For example, he was able to solve the problem of inscribing an equilateral pentagon into a square, resulting in a fourth degree equation .

[ 6 ] He also wrote a treatise on the "perfect compass", a compass with one leg of variable length that allows users to draw any conic section : straight lines , circles , ellipses , parabolas and hyperbolas .

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] It is likely that al-Qūhī invented the device.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] Like Aristotle , al-Qūhī proposed that the weight of bodies varies with their distance from the center of the Earth.

[ 12 ] The correspondence between al-Qūhī and Abu Ishaq al-Sabi, a high civil servant interested in mathematics, has been preserved.

The Perian Abu Sahl Wajjan Ibn Rustam Al-Quhi, also known as Abu Sahl Al-Kuhi or just Kuhi, studied optics and investigated the optical properties of mirrors made from conic sections ^ al-Qūhī, Abu Sahl Wayjan ibn Rustam (c. 940-c. 1000) ^ Suter, Die Mathematiker und Astronomen der Araber (75-76, 1900). In his treatise On Rising Times, he wrote that he had also investigated astronomy as well as centers of gravity and optics. His Perfect Compass, for example, represented a step beyond Ibn Sina ’s pointwise constructions of conic sections and described an instrument al-Qūhī characterized as useful for drawing these sections on sundials and astrolabes.
