[ 1 ] During prolonged incidents surrounding an immediate danger to life or health environment, first responders working in unsafe environments wear a self-contained breathing apparatus. The depleted air cylinders within the breathing apparatus must be replaced and refilled throughout the incident.

[ 2 ] The air and light unit can refill the cylinders while in the field using an onboard air compressor and cascade system .

[ 1 ] It also carries a supply of spare air cylinders. Air and light units are highly customizable and can vary significantly between departments.

[ 3 ] Units are also equipped with diesel generators , which supply electricity to power portable lights and overall scene illumination equipment.

[ 4 ] This is usually done via a roof-mounted telescoping light bank. Units may typically supply electrical power in an emergency to a shelter, base camp, or medical facility.

[ citation needed ] In the United States , Chapter 24 of National Fire Protection Association Regulation 1901 outlines specifications for any air system mounted on firefighting apparatus .
