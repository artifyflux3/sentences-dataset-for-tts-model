Antiquity, Classical and Medieval eras [ edit ] Date Development Antiquity Greek myths of Hephaestus and Pygmalion incorporated the idea of intelligent automata (such as Talos ) and artificial beings (such as Galatea and Pandora ).

[ 1 ] Sacred mechanical statues built in Egypt and Greece were believed to be capable of wisdom and emotion.

Hermes Trismegistus would write "they have sensus and spiritus ... by discovering the true nature of the gods, man has been able to reproduce it." [ 2 ] 10th century BC Yan Shi presented King Mu of Zhou with mechanical men which were capable of moving their bodies independently.

[ 3 ] 384 BC–322 BC Aristotle described the syllogism , a method of formal, mechanical thought in the Organon .

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] Aristotle also described means–ends analysis (an algorithm for planning ) in Nicomachean Ethics , the same algorithm used by Newell and Simon 's General Problem Solver (1959).

[ 7 ] 3rd century BC Ctesibius invents a mechanical water clock with an alarm. This was the first example of a feedback mechanism.

[ citation needed ] 1st century Hero of Alexandria created mechanical men and other automatons .

[ 8 ] He produced what may have been "the world's first practical programmable machine:" [ 9 ] an automatic theatre.

260 Porphyry wrote Isagogê which categorized knowledge and logic, including a drawing of what would later be called a " semantic net ".

[ 10 ] ~800 Jabir ibn Hayyan developed the Arabic alchemical theory of Takwin , the artificial creation of life in the laboratory, up to and including human life.

[ 11 ] 9th Century The Banū Mūsā brothers created a programmable music automaton described in their Book of Ingenious Devices: a steam-driven flute controlled by a program represented by pins on a revolving cylinder.

[ 12 ] This was "perhaps the first machine with a stored program ".

[ 9 ] al-Khwarizmi wrote textbooks with precise step-by-step methods for arithmetic and algebra, used in Islam, India and Europe until the 16th century. The word " algorithm " is derived from his name.

[ 13 ] 1206 Ismail al-Jazari created a programmable orchestra of mechanical human beings.

[ 14 ] 1275 Ramon Llull , Mallorcan theologian , invents the Ars Magna , a tool for combining concepts mechanically based on an Arabic astrological tool, the Zairja . Llull described his machines as mechanical entities that could combine basic truth and facts to produce advanced knowledge. The method would be developed further by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in the 17th century.

[ 15 ] ~1500 Paracelsus claimed to have created an artificial man out of magnetism, sperm and alchemy.

[ 16 ] ~1580 Rabbi Judah Loew ben Bezalel of Prague is said to have invented the Golem , a clay man brought to life.

[ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 6 ] 1623 Wilhelm Schickard drew a calculating clock on a letter to Kepler . This will be the first of five unsuccessful attempts at designing a direct entry calculating clock in the 17th century (including the designs of Tito Burattini , Samuel Morland and René Grillet ).

[ a ] 1641 Thomas Hobbes published Leviathan and presented a mechanical, combinatorial theory of cognition. He wrote "...for reason is nothing but reckoning".

[ 20 ] [ 21 ] 1642 Blaise Pascal invented a mechanical calculator , [ b ] the first digital calculating machine .

[ 22 ] 1647 René Descartes proposed that bodies of animals are nothing more than complex machines (but that mental phenomena are of a different "substance").

[ 23 ] 1654 Blaise Pascal described how to find expected values in probability, in 1662 Antoine Arnauld published a formula to find the maximum expected value , and in 1663, Gerolamo Cardano 's solution to the same problems is published 116 years after it was written. The theory of probability is further developed by Jacob Bernoulli and Pierre-Simon Laplace in the 18th century.

[ 24 ] Probability theory would become central to AI and machine learning from the 1990s onward.

1672 Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz improved the earlier machines, making the Stepped Reckoner to do multiplication and division .

[ 25 ] 1676 Leibniz derived the chain rule .

[ 26 ] The rule is used by AI to train neural networks, for example the backpropagation algorithm uses the chain rule.

[ 9 ] 1679 Leibniz developed a universal calculus of reasoning ( alphabet of human thought ) by which arguments could be decided mechanically. It assigned a specific number to each and every object in the world, as a prelude to an algebraic solution to all possible problems.

[ 27 ] 1726 Jonathan Swift published Gulliver's Travels , which includes this description of the Engine , a machine on the island of Laputa : "a Project for improving speculative Knowledge by practical and mechanical Operations" by using this "Contrivance", "the most ignorant Person at a reasonable Charge, and with a little bodily Labour, may write Books in Philosophy, Poetry, Politicks, Law, Mathematicks, and Theology, with the least Assistance from Genius or study." [ 28 ] The machine is a parody of Ars Magna , one of the inspirations of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz ' mechanism.

1738 Daniel Bernoulli introduces the concept of " utility ", a generalization of probability, the basis of economics and decision theory , and the mathematical foundation for the way AI represents the "goals" of intelligent agents .

[ 29 ] 1739 David Hume described induction , the logical method of learning generalities from examples.

[ 6 ] 1750 Julien Offray de La Mettrie published L'Homme Machine , which argued that human thought is strictly mechanical.

[ 30 ] 1763 Thomas Bayes 's work An Essay Towards Solving a Problem in the Doctrine of Chances , published two years after his death, laid the foundations of Bayes' theorem and used in modern AI in Bayesian networks .

[ 24 ] 1769 Wolfgang von Kempelen built and toured with his chess -playing automaton , The Turk , which Kempelen claimed could defeat human players.

[ 31 ] The Turk was later shown to be a hoax , involving a human chess player.

1795-1805 The simplest kind of artificial neural network is the linear network. It has been known for over two centuries as the method of least squares or linear regression . It was used as a means of finding a good rough linear fit to a set of points by Adrien-Marie Legendre (1805) [ 32 ] and Carl Friedrich Gauss (1795) [ 33 ] for the prediction of planetary movement.

[ 9 ] [ 34 ] 1800 Joseph Marie Jacquard created a programmable loom, based on earlier inventions by Basile Bouchon (1725), Jean-Baptiste Falcon (1728) and Jacques Vaucanson (1740).

[ 35 ] Replaceable punched cards controlled sequences of operations in the process of manufacturing textiles . This may have been the first industrial software for commercial enterprises .

[ 9 ] 1818 Mary Shelley published the story of Frankenstein; or the Modern Prometheus , a fictional consideration of the ethics of creating sentient beings.

[ 36 ] 1822–1859 Charles Babbage & Ada Lovelace worked on programmable mechanical calculating machines .

[ 37 ] 1837 The mathematician Bernard Bolzano made the first modern attempt to formalize semantics .

[ 38 ] 1854 George Boole set out to "investigate the fundamental laws of those operations of the mind by which reasoning is performed, to give expression to them in the symbolic language of a calculus", inventing Boolean algebra .

[ 39 ] 1863 Samuel Butler suggested that Darwinian evolution also applies to machines, and speculates that they will one day become conscious and eventually supplant humanity.

[ 46 ] [ 9 ] 1920s and 1930s Ludwig Wittgenstein 's Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus (1921) inspires Rudolf Carnap and the logical positivists of the Vienna Circle to use formal logic as the foundation of philosophy. However, Wittgenstein's later work in the 1940s demonstrates that context free symbolic logic is incoherent without human interpretation.

1931 Kurt Gödel encoded mathematical statements and proofs as integers, and showed that there are true theorems that are unprovable by any consistent theorem-proving machine. Thus "he identified fundamental limits of algorithmic theorem proving, computing, and any type of computation-based AI," [ 9 ] laying foundations of theoretical computer science and AI theory.

1935 Alonzo Church extended Gödel's proof and showed that the decision problem of computer science does not have a general solution.

[ 47 ] He developed the Lambda calculus , which will eventually be fundamental to the theory of computer languages.

1948 Alan Turing produces "Intelligent Machinery" report, regarded as the first manifesto of Artificial Intelligence. It introduces many concepts including the logic-based approach to problem solving, that intellectual activity consists mainly of various kinds of search, and a discussion of machine learning in which he anticipates the Connectionism AI approach.

[ 52 ] John von Neumann (quoted by Edwin Thompson Jaynes ) in response to a comment at a lecture that it was impossible for a machine (at least ones created by humans) to think: "You insist that there is something a machine cannot do. If you will tell me precisely what it is that a machine cannot do, then I can always make a machine which will do just that!". Von Neumann was presumably alluding to the Church–Turing thesis which states that any effective procedure can be simulated by a (generalized) computer.

1949 Donald O. Hebb develops Hebbian theory , a possible algorithm for learning in neural networks .

[ 53 ] 1950s [ edit ] Date Development 1950 Alan Turing published " Computing Machinery and Intelligence ", which proposes the Turing test as a measure of machine intelligence and answered all of the most common objections to the proposal "machines can think".

This is often called the first AI program, though Samuel's checkers program also has a strong claim. This program has been described as the first deliberately engineered to perform automated reasoning, and would eventually prove 38 of the first 52 theorems in Russell and Whitehead 's Principia Mathematica , and find new and more elegant proofs for some.

[ 62 ] Simon said that they had "solved the venerable mind–body problem , explaining how a system composed of matter can have the properties of mind".

[ 63 ] 1958 John McCarthy ( Massachusetts Institute of Technology or MIT) invented the Lisp programming language .

[ 58 ] Herbert Gelernter and Nathan Rochester (IBM) described a theorem prover in geometry .

[ 58 ] It exploited a semantic model of the domain in the form of diagrams of "typical" cases.

He referred to Kurt Gödel 's result of 1931: sufficiently powerful formal systems are either inconsistent or allow for formulating true theorems unprovable by any theorem-proving AI deriving all provable theorems from the axioms. Since humans are able to "see" the truth of such theorems, machines were deemed inferior.

( September 2023 ) The number of the public's Google searches for the term "AI" began to accelerate in 2022.

Date Development 2020 In February 2020, Microsoft introduces its Turing Natural Language Generation (T-NLG), which is the "largest language model ever published at 17 billion parameters".

[ 135 ] In November 2020, AlphaFold 2 by DeepMind, a model that performs predictions of protein structure , wins the CASP competition.

[ 136 ] OpenAI introduces GPT-3 , a state-of-the-art autoregressive language model that uses deep learning to produce a variety of computer codes, poetry and other language tasks exceptionally similar, and almost indistinguishable from those written by humans. Its capacity was ten times greater than that of the T-NLG. It was introduced in May 2020, [ 137 ] and was in beta testing in June 2020.

2022 ChatGPT , an AI chatbot developed by OpenAI , debuts in November 2022. It is initially built on top of the GPT-3.5 large language model . While it gains considerable praise for the breadth of its knowledge base, deductive abilities, and the human-like fluidity of its natural language responses, [ 138 ] [ 139 ] it also garners criticism for, among other things, its tendency to " hallucinate ", [ 140 ] [ 141 ] a phenomenon in which an AI responds with factually incorrect answers with high confidence. The release triggers widespread public discussion on artificial intelligence and its potential impact on society.

[ 142 ] [ 143 ] A November 2022 class action lawsuit against Microsoft , GitHub and OpenAI alleges that GitHub Copilot , an AI-powered code editing tool trained on public GitHub repositories, violates the copyrights of the repositories' authors, noting that the tool is able to generate source code which matches its training data verbatim, without providing attribution.

[ 144 ] 2023 By January 2023, ChatGPT has more than 100 million users, making it the fastest-growing consumer application to date.

[ 145 ] On January 16, 2023, three artists, Sarah Andersen , Kelly McKernan, and Karla Ortiz, file a class-action copyright infringement lawsuit against Stability AI , Midjourney , and DeviantArt , claiming that these companies have infringed the rights of millions of artists by training AI tools on five billion images scraped from the web without the consent of the original artists.

[ 146 ] On January 17, 2023, Stability AI is sued in London by Getty Images for using its images in their training data without purchasing a license.

[ 147 ] [ 148 ] Getty files another suit against Stability AI in a US district court in Delaware on February 6, 2023. In the suit, Getty again alleges copyright infringement for the use of its images in the training of Stable Diffusion , and further argues that the model infringes Getty's trademark by generating images with Getty's watermark .

[ 149 ] OpenAI 's GPT-4 model is released in March 2023 and is regarded as an impressive improvement over GPT-3.5 , with the caveat that GPT-4 retains many of the same problems of the earlier iteration.

[ 150 ] Unlike previous iterations, GPT-4 is multimodal, allowing image input as well as text. GPT-4 is integrated into ChatGPT as a subscriber service. OpenAI claims that in their own testing the model received a score of 1410 on the SAT (94th percentile), [ 151 ] 163 on the LSAT (88th percentile), and 298 on the Uniform Bar Exam (90th percentile).

[ 152 ] On March 7, 2023, Nature Biomedical Engineering writes that "it is no longer possible to accurately distinguish" human-written text from text created by large language models, and that "It is all but certain that general-purpose large language models will rapidly proliferate... It is a rather safe bet that they will change many industries over time." [ 153 ] In response to ChatGPT, Google releases in a limited capacity its chatbot Google Bard , based on the LaMDA and PaLM large language models, in March 2023.

[ 154 ] [ 155 ] On March 29, 2023, a petition of over 1,000 signatures is signed by Elon Musk, Steve Wozniak and other tech leaders, calling for a 6-month halt to what the petition refers to as "an out-of-control race" producing AI systems that its creators can not "understand, predict, or reliably control".

[ 156 ] [ 157 ] In May 2023, Google makes an announcement regarding Bard's transition from LaMDA to PaLM2, a significantly more advanced language model.

[ 158 ] In the last week of May 2023, a Statement on AI Risk is signed by Geoffrey Hinton , Sam Altman , Bill Gates , and many other prominent AI researchers and tech leaders with the following succinct message: "Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war." [ 159 ] [ 160 ] On July 9, 2023, Sarah Silverman files a class action lawsuit against Meta and OpenAI for copyright infringement for training their large language models on millions of authors' copyrighted works without permission.

[ 161 ] In August, 2023, the New York Times, CNN, Reuters, the Chicago Tribune, Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) and other news companies block OpenAI's GPTBot web crawler from accessing their content, while the New York Times also updates its terms of service to disallow the use of its content in large language models.

[ 162 ] On September 13, 2023, in a serious response to growing anxiety about the dangers of AI, the US Senate holds the inaugural bipartisan " AI Insight Forum ", bringing together senators, CEOs, civil rights leaders and other industry reps, to further familiarize senators with the nature of AI and its risks, and to discuss needed safeguards and legislation.

[ 163 ] The event is organized by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), [ 164 ] and is chaired by U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Founder and co-chair of the Senate AI Caucus.

[ 165 ] Reflecting the importance of the meeting, the forum is attended by over 60 senators, [ 166 ] as well as Elon Musk (Tesla CEO), Mark Zuckerberg (Meta CEO), Sam Altman (OpenAI CEO), Sundar Pichai (Alphabet CEO), Bill Gates (Microsoft co-founder), Satya Nadella (Microsoft CEO), Jensen Huang (Nvidia CEO), Arvind Krishna (IBM CEO), Alex Karp (Palantir CEO), Charles Rivkin (chairman and CEO of the MPA), Meredith Stiehm (president of the Writers Guild of America West), Liz Shuler ( AFL-CIO President), and Maya Wiley (CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights ), among others.

[ 163 ] [ 164 ] [ 166 ] In October 2023, AlpineGate AI Technologies Inc. CEO John Godel announced the launch of their AI Suite, AGImageAI, along with their proprietary GPT model, AlbertAGPT.

[ 167 ] On October 30, 2023, US President Biden signed the Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence .

[ 168 ] [ 169 ] In November 2023, the first global AI Safety Summit was held in Bletchley Park in the UK to discuss the near and far term risks of AI and the possibility of mandatory and voluntary regulatory frameworks.

[ 170 ] 28 countries including the United States, China, and the European Union issued a declaration at the start of the summit, calling for international co-operation to manage the challenges and risks of artificial intelligence.

[ 171 ] [ 172 ] Google releases Gemini 1.0 Ultra.

2024 On February 15, 2024, Google releases Gemini 1.5 in limited beta, capable of context length up to 1 million tokens.

Also, on February 15, 2024, OpenAI publicly announces Sora , a text-to-video model for generating videos up to a minute long.

Google DeepMind unveils DNA prediction software AlphaFold which helps to identify cancer and genetic diseases.

On 22 February, StabilityAI announces Stable Diffusion 3, using a similar architecture to Sora .

On June 10, Apple announced " Apple Intelligence " which incorporates ChatGPT into new iPhones and Siri .

On October 9, co-founder and CEO of Google DeepMind and Isomorphic Labs Sir Demis Hassabis, and Google DeepMind Director Dr. John Jumper were co-awarded the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their work developing AlphaFold , a groundbreaking AI system that predicts the 3D structure of proteins from their amino acid sequences.
