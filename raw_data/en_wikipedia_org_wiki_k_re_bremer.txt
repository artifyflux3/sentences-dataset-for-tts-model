In 1979 he was appointed Docent . In 1980 he became Curator at the Museum of Natural History in Stockholm in the Department of Spermatophyte Botany. From 1985 to 1986 he was also a Research Associate and BA Krukoff Curator of African Botany at the Missouri Botanical Garden .

Following this Bremer was installed as Professor of Systematic Botany at Uppsala University in 1989, where he also became head of the department from 1992 to 1999, and Dean of Biology from 1993 to 1999. From 2001 to 2004 he was Secretary for Science and Technology Studies at the Swedish Research Council .  In January 2004 he left the University of Uppsala to take up a position as Rector (Vice-Chancellor) at Stockholm University on 1 February that year.

[ 1 ] He is currently professor of Systematic Botany at that university.

[ 2 ] Personal life [ edit ] He is married to his colleague, Birgitta Bremer , and they have two children.

Achievements [ edit ] Professor Bremer is a board member of the Swedish Association of Universities and Institutes of Higher Education ( Sveriges universitets- och högskoleförbund , SUHF) and is a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences ( Kungliga Vetenskapsakademien , KVA).

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] The work of the Bremers at Uppsala University became the basis for the modern system of plant taxonomy , known as the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group ( APG ) formed by them and other international flowering plant systematists .  The system was published in 1998 [ 6 ] largely based on the work of Bremer et al. at Uppsala University , [ 7 ] and was available on the internet in 1996.

[ 8 ] Moreover, Bremer is known for several important innovations in phylogenetics (Bremer's support [ 9 ] ) and biogeography (ancestral areas analysis [ 10 ] ).

Species [ edit ] Two African species of the Asteraceae family have been named after him, Athanasia bremeri and Pseudoblepharispermum bremeri .

The standard author abbreviation K.Bremer is used to indicate this person as the author when citing a botanical name .
