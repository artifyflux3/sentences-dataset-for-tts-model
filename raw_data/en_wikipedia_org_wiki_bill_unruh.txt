Early life and education [ edit ] Unruh was born into a Mennonite family in Winnipeg , Manitoba . His parents were Benjamin Unruh, a refugee from Russia , and Anna Janzen, who was born in Canada. He obtained his B.Sc. from the University of Manitoba in 1967, followed by an M.A. (1969) and Ph.D. (1971) from Princeton University , New Jersey , under the direction of John Archibald Wheeler .

Areas of research [ edit ] Unruh has made seminal contributions to our understanding of gravity , [ 1 ] [ 2 ] black holes , [ 3 ] cosmology , and quantum fields in curved spaces, including the discovery of what is now known as the Unruh effect . Unruh has contributed to the foundations of quantum mechanics in areas such as decoherence [ 4 ] and the question of time in quantum mechanics. He has helped to clarify the meaning of nonlocality in a quantum context, in particular that quantum nonlocality does not follow from Bell's theorem and that ultimately quantum mechanics is a local theory.

[ 5 ] Unruh is also one of the main critics of the Afshar experiment .

[ 6 ] Unruh is also interested in music and teaches the Physics of Music.

Unruh effect [ edit ] Main article: Unruh effect The Unruh effect, described by Unruh in 1976, is the prediction that an accelerating observer will observe black-body radiation where an inertial observer would observe none.

[ 3 ] In other words, the accelerating observer will find itself in a warm background, the temperature of which is proportional to the acceleration. The same quantum state of a field, which is taken to be the ground state for observers in inertial systems, is seen as a thermal state for the uniformly accelerated observer. The Unruh effect therefore means that the very notion of the quantum vacuum depends on the path of the observer through spacetime .

The Unruh effect can be expressed in a simple equation giving the equivalent energy kT of a uniformly accelerating particle (with a being the constant acceleration), as: k T = ℏ ℏ a 2 π π c {\displaystyle kT={\frac {\hbar a}{2\pi c}}} References [ edit ] ^ M.
