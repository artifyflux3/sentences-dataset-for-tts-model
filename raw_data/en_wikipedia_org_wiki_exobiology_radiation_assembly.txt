An astrobiology mission developed by the European Space Agency (ESA), it took place aboard the European Retrievable Carrier (EURECA), an unmanned 4.5 tonne satellite with a payload of 15 experiments.

[ 1 ] It was launched 31 July 1992 by the STS-46 - Space Shuttle Atlantis and put into orbit at an altitude of 508 km. It was retrieved on 1 July 1993 by STS-57 - Space Shuttle Endeavour and returned to Earth for further analysis.

Objectives [ edit ] The experiment's goal was to study the response of dehydrated and metabolically dormant microorganisms (spores of Bacillus subtilis , cells of Deinococcus radiodurans , conidial spores of Aspergillus species ) and cellular constituents ( plasmid DNA , proteins , purple membranes , amino acids , urea ) to the extremely dehydrating conditions of outer space, in some cases in combination with irradiation by solar UV light .

[ 2 ] Results [ edit ] ERA provided information on the long-exposure of invertebrates , microorganisms and organic molecules to outer space conditions, such as ultraviolet (UV) radiation, cosmic radiation and vacuum .

Spores of different strains of Bacillus subtilis and the Escherichia coli plasmid pUC19 were exposed to selected conditions of space (space vacuum and/or defined wavebands and intensities of solar ultraviolet radiation). After the approximately 11-month mission, the organisms' responses were studied in terms of survival, mutagenesis in the his ( B. subtilis ) or lac locus (pUC19), induction of DNA strand breaks, efficiency of DNA repair systems, and the role of external protective agents. The data were compared with those of a simultaneously running ground control experiment.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] When spores were exposed to the vacuum of space, but shielded from solar radiation, their survivability was substantially increased if they were exposed in multilayers and/or in the presence of glucose .

Spores embedded in artificial meteorites ( clays and simulated Martian soil ) did not survive.

Vacuum treatment lead to an increase of mutation frequency in spores, but not in plasmid DNA.

Extraterrestrial solar ultraviolet radiation was mutagenic , inducing strand breakage in the DNA and substantially reducing survival.

Spectroscopy confirmed the results of previous space experiments of a synergistic action of space vacuum and solar UV radiation with DNA being the critical target.

The decrease in the microorganisms' viability could be correlated with the increase in DNA damage .

The purple membranes, amino acids and urea were not measurably affected by the dehydrating condition of open space, if sheltered from solar radiation. Plasmid DNA, however, showed a significant amount of strand breakage.
