As of 2021 [update] , it is approximately 89.7 AU (13.42 billion km ) from the Sun , and will slowly decrease in distance until it reaches its perihelion of 38 AU in 2142. The discoverers have nicknamed it " DeeDee " for "Distant Dwarf ".

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] 2014 UZ 224 was discovered by a team led by David Gerdes using data collected by the large camera Dark Energy Camera (DECam) .

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] The discovery was announced by the Minor Planet Center on 11 October 2016.

[ 9 ] It has a diameter of ~635 km (395 mi) and reflects just 13 percent of the sunlight that hits it.

[ 3 ] [ 2 ] The earliest known precovery observations of 2014 UZ 224 were taken at the Mauna Kea Observatory on 15 October 2006.

[ 1 ] 2014 UZ 224 has not yet been imaged by high-resolution telescopes, so it has no known moons.

[ 10 ] The Hubble Space Telescope is planned to image 2014 UZ 224 in 2026, which should determine if it has significantly sized moons.

[ 10 ] Orbit [ edit ] Discovery images of 2014 UZ 224 by DECam from 21 and 23 October 2014 Diagram showing the orbits of 2014 UZ 224 (gray) and the outer planets. The vertical gray lines along 2014 UZ 224 's orbit mark its vertical positions above and below the ecliptic plane.

It orbits the Sun once every approximately 1,100 years and is the second farthest object from the Sun with a stable orbit. Its perihelion is almost as close as Pluto’s aphelion and will reach it on 22 May 2142.

Numbering and naming [ edit ] As of 2025, this minor planet has not been numbered or named by the Minor Planet Center .
