In this topology, a set is open if its complement in X {\displaystyle X} is either countable or equal to the entire set. Equivalently, the open sets consist of the empty set and all subsets of X {\displaystyle X} whose complements are countable, a property known as cocountability . The only closed sets in this topology are X {\displaystyle X} itself and the countable subsets of X {\displaystyle X} .

Definitions [ edit ] Let X {\displaystyle X} be an infinite set and let T {\displaystyle {\mathcal {T}}} be the set of subsets of X {\displaystyle X} such that H ∈ ∈ T ⟺ ⟺ X ∖ ∖ H is countable, or H = ∅ ∅ {\displaystyle H\in {\mathcal {T}}\iff X\setminus H{\mbox{ is countable, or}}\,H=\varnothing } then T {\displaystyle {\mathcal {T}}} is the countable complement topology on X {\displaystyle X} , and the topological space T = ( X , T ) {\displaystyle T=(X,{\mathcal {T}})} is a countable complement space.

[ 1 ] Symbolically, the topology is typically written as T = { H ⊆ ⊆ X : H = ∅ ∅ or X ∖ ∖ H is countable } .

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {T}}=\{H\subseteq X:H=\varnothing {\mbox{ or }}X\setminus H{\mbox{ is countable}}\}.} Double pointed cocountable topology [ edit ] Let X {\displaystyle X} be an uncountable set . We define the topology T {\displaystyle {\mathcal {T}}} as all open sets whose complements are countable, along with ∅ ∅ {\displaystyle \varnothing } and X {\displaystyle X} itself.

[ 2 ] Cocountable extension topology [ edit ] Let X {\displaystyle X} be the real line. Now let T 1 {\displaystyle {\mathcal {T}}_{1}} be the Euclidean topology and T 2 {\displaystyle {\mathcal {T}}_{2}} be the cocountable topology on X {\displaystyle X} . The cocountable extension topology is the smallest topology generated by T 1 ∪ ∪ T 2 {\displaystyle {\mathcal {T}}_{1}\cup {\mathcal {T}}_{2}} .

[ 3 ] Proof that cocountable topology is a topology [ edit ] By definition, the empty set ∅ ∅ {\displaystyle \varnothing } is an element of T {\displaystyle {\mathcal {T}}} . Similarly, the entire set X ∈ ∈ T {\displaystyle X\in {\mathcal {T}}} , since the complement of X {\displaystyle X} relative to itself is the empty set, which is vacuously countable.

Suppose A , B ∈ ∈ T {\displaystyle A,B\in {\mathcal {T}}} . Let H = A ∩ ∩ B {\displaystyle H=A\cap B} . Then X ∖ ∖ H = X ∖ ∖ ( A ∩ ∩ B ) = ( X ∖ ∖ A ) ∪ ∪ ( X ∖ ∖ B ) {\displaystyle X\setminus H=X\setminus (A\cap B)=(X\setminus A)\cup (X\setminus B)} by De Morgan's laws . Since A , B ∈ ∈ T {\displaystyle A,B\in {\mathcal {T}}} , it follows that X ∖ ∖ A {\displaystyle X\setminus A} and X ∖ ∖ B {\displaystyle X\setminus B} are both countable. Because the countable union of countable sets is countable, X ∖ ∖ H {\displaystyle X\setminus H} is also countable. Therefore, H = A ∩ ∩ B ∈ ∈ T {\displaystyle H=A\cap B\in {\mathcal {T}}} , as its complement is countable.

Now let U ⊆ ⊆ T {\displaystyle {\mathcal {U}}\subseteq {\mathcal {T}}} . Then X ∖ ∖ ( ⋃ ⋃ U ) = ⋂ ⋂ U ∈ ∈ U ( X ∖ ∖ U ) {\displaystyle X\setminus \left(\bigcup {\mathcal {U}}\right)=\bigcap _{U\in {\mathcal {U}}}(X\setminus U)} again by De Morgan's laws. For each U ∈ ∈ U {\displaystyle U\in {\mathcal {U}}} , X ∖ ∖ U {\displaystyle X\setminus U} is countable. The countable intersection of countable sets is also countable (assuming U {\displaystyle {\mathcal {U}}} is countable), so S ∖ ∖ ( ⋃ ⋃ U ) {\displaystyle S\setminus \left(\bigcup {\mathcal {U}}\right)} is countable. Thus, ⋃ ⋃ U ∈ ∈ T {\displaystyle \bigcup {\mathcal {U}}\in {\mathcal {T}}} .

Since all three open set axioms are met, T {\displaystyle {\mathcal {T}}} is a topology on X {\displaystyle X} .

[ 4 ] Properties [ edit ] Every set X {\displaystyle X} with the cocountable topology is Lindelöf , since every nonempty open set omits only countably many points of X {\displaystyle X} . It is also T 1 , as all singletons are closed.

If X {\displaystyle X} is an uncountable set, then any two nonempty open sets intersect , hence, the space is not Hausdorff . However, in the cocountable topology all convergent sequences are eventually constant, so limits are unique. Since compact sets in X {\displaystyle X} are finite subsets, all compact subsets are closed, another condition usually related to the Hausdorff separation axiom.

The cocountable topology on a countable set is the discrete topology . The cocountable topology on an uncountable set is hyperconnected , thus connected , locally connected and pseudocompact , but neither weakly countably compact nor countably metacompact , hence not compact.

Examples [ edit ] Uncountable set: On any uncountable set, such as the real numbers R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } , the cocountable topology is a proper subset of the standard topology . In this case, the topology is T 1 but not Hausdorff, first-countable, nor metrizable .

Countable set: If X {\displaystyle X} is countable, then every subset of X {\displaystyle X} has a countable complement. In this case, the cocountable topology is just the discrete topology .

Finite sets: On a finite set, the cocountable topology reduces to the indiscrete topology , consisting only of the empty set and the whole set. This is because any proper subset of a finite set has a finite (and hence not countable) complement, violating the openness condition.

Subspace topology: If Y ⊆ ⊆ X {\displaystyle Y\subseteq X} and X {\displaystyle X} carries the cocountable topology, then Y {\displaystyle Y} inherits the subspace topology . This topology on Y {\displaystyle Y} consists of the empty set,  all of Y {\displaystyle Y} , and all subsets U ⊆ ⊆ Y {\displaystyle U\subseteq Y} such that Y ∖ ∖ U {\displaystyle Y\setminus U} is countable.
