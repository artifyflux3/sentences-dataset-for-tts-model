First inhabited by modern humans during the Late Paleolithic , [ 13 ] present-day Turkey was home to various ancient peoples .

[ 14 ] The Hattians were assimilated by the Hittites and other Anatolian peoples .

[ 15 ] Classical Anatolia transitioned into cultural Hellenization after Alexander the Great 's conquests, and later Romanization during the Roman and Byzantine eras.

[ 16 ] The Seljuk Turks began migrating into Anatolia in the 11th century, starting the Turkification process.

[ 17 ] The Seljuk Sultanate of Rum ruled Anatolia until the Mongol invasion in 1243, when it disintegrated into Turkish principalities .

[ 18 ] Beginning in 1299, the Ottomans united the principalities and expanded .

Mehmed II conquered Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul) in 1453 . During the reigns of Selim I and Suleiman the Magnificent , the Ottoman Empire became a global power .

[ 19 ] From 1789 onwards, the empire saw major changes, reforms , centralization, and rising nationalism while its territory declined .

[ 20 ] In the 19th and early 20th centuries, persecution of Muslims during the Ottoman contraction and in the Russian Empire resulted in large-scale loss of life and mass migration into modern-day Turkey from the Balkans , Caucasus , and Crimea .

[ 21 ] Under the control of the Three Pashas , the Ottoman Empire entered World War I in 1914, during which the Ottoman government committed genocides against its Armenian , Greek , and Assyrian subjects.

[ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] Following Ottoman defeat, the Turkish War of Independence resulted in the abolition of the sultanate and the signing of the Treaty of Lausanne . Turkey emerged as a more homogenous nation state .

[ 25 ] The Republic was proclaimed on 29 October 1923, modelled on the reforms initiated by the country's first president, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk .

Etymology Main article: Name of Turkey Turchia , meaning "the land of the Turks", had begun to be used in European texts for Anatolia by the end of the 12th century.

[ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] As a word in Turkic languages , Turk may mean "strong, strength, ripe" or "flourishing, in full strength".

[ 32 ] It may also mean ripe as in for a fruit or "in the prime of life, young, and vigorous" for a person.

[ 33 ] As an ethnonym , the etymology is still unknown.

[ 34 ] In addition to usage in languages such as Chinese in the 6th century, [ 31 ] the earliest mention of Turk ( 𐱅𐰇𐰺𐰜 , türü̲k̲ ; or 𐱅𐰇𐰼𐰚 , türk/tẄrk ) in Turkic languages comes from the Second Turkic Khaganate .

[ 35 ] In Byzantine sources in the 10th century, the name Tourkia was used for defining two medieval states: Hungary ( Western Tourkia ); and Khazaria ( Eastern Tourkia ).

[ 36 ] [ 37 ] The Mamluk Sultanate , with its ruling elite of Turkic origin, was called the "State of the Turks" ( Dawlat at-Turk , or Dawlat al-Atrāk , or Dawlat-at-Turkiyya ).

[ 38 ] Turkestan, also meaning the "land of the Turks", was used for a historic region in Central Asia .

[ 39 ] Middle English usage of Turkye or Turkeye is found in The Book of the Duchess (written in 1369–1372) to refer to Anatolia or the Ottoman Empire .

[ 40 ] The modern spelling Turkey dates back to at least 1719.

[ 41 ] The bird called turkey was named as such due to trade of guineafowl from Turkey to England.

[ 31 ] The name Turkey has been used in international treaties referring to the Ottoman Empire.

[ 42 ] With the Treaty of Alexandropol in 1920, the name Türkiye entered international documents for the first time. In the treaty signed with Afghanistan in 1921, the expression Devlet-i Âliyye-i Türkiyye ("Sublime Turkish State") was used, likened to the Ottoman Empire's name.

[ 43 ] In December 2021, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan called for expanded official usage of Türkiye , saying that Türkiye "represents and expresses the culture, civilization, and values of the Turkish nation in the best way".

[ 44 ] In May 2022, the Turkish government requested the United Nations and other international organizations to use Türkiye officially in English; the UN agreed.

[ 45 ] [ 46 ] [ 47 ] History Main article: History of Turkey See also: History of Anatolia , History of Thrace , and Ancient regions of Anatolia Prehistory and ancient history Main articles: Prehistory of Anatolia and Prehistory of Southeast Europe See also: Hattians , Hittites , Luwians , and Pala (Anatolia) Some henges at Göbekli Tepe were erected as far back as 9600 BC , predating those of Stonehenge by over seven millennia.

[ 48 ] Present-day Turkey has been inhabited by modern humans since the late Paleolithic period and contains some of the world's oldest Neolithic sites.

[ 49 ] [ 50 ] Göbekli Tepe is close to 12,000 years old.

[ 49 ] Parts of Anatolia include the Fertile Crescent , an origin of agriculture .

[ 51 ] Other important Anatolian Neolithic sites include Çatalhöyük and Alaca Höyük .

[ 52 ] Neolithic Anatolian farmers differed genetically from farmers in Iran and Jordan Valley .

[ 53 ] These early Anatolian farmers also migrated into Europe , starting around 9,000 years ago.

[ 53 ] [ 54 ] [ 55 ] Troy 's earliest layers go back to around 4500 BC.

[ 52 ] Map of the Hittite Empire at its greatest extent, with Hittite rule c.

1300 BC Anatolia's historical records start with clay tablets from approximately around 2000 BC that were found in modern-day Kültepe .

[ 56 ] These tablets belonged to an Assyrian trade colony .

[ 56 ] The languages in Anatolia at that time included Hattian, Hurrian, Hittite , Luwian , and Palaic .

[ 57 ] Hattian was a language indigenous to Anatolia, with no known modern-day connections.

[ 57 ] [ 58 ] Hurrian language was used in northern Syria .

[ 57 ] Hittite, Palaic, and Luwian languages were "the oldest written Indo-European languages ", [ 59 ] forming the Anatolian sub-group .

[ 60 ] [ c ] Hattian rulers were gradually replaced by Hittite rulers.

[ 56 ] The Hittite kingdom was a large kingdom in Central Anatolia, with its capital of Hattusa .

[ 56 ] It co-existed in Anatolia with Palaians and Luwians , approximately between 1700 and 1200 BC.

[ 56 ] As the Hittite kingdom was disintegrating, further waves of Indo-European peoples migrated from southeastern Europe, which was followed by warfare.

[ 64 ] The Thracians were also present in modern-day Turkish Thrace .

[ 65 ] It is not known if the Trojan War is based on historical events.

[ 66 ] Troy's Late Bronze Age layers matches most with Iliad ' s story.

[ 67 ] Early classical antiquity Main article: Classical Anatolia See also: Phrygia , Lydia , Lycia , Caria , Urartu , Achaemenid Empire , and Hellenistic period Lycian Way is a 760 kilometers (470 mi) long hiking path in Southwestern Turkey.

[ 68 ] Around 750 BC, Phrygia had been established, with its two centers in Gordium and modern-day Kayseri .

[ 69 ] Phrygians spoke an Indo-European language, which was closer to Greek than Anatolian languages.

[ 60 ] Phrygians shared Anatolia with Neo-Hittites and Urartu . Luwian-speakers were probably the majority in various Anatolian Neo-Hittite states.

[ 70 ] Urartians spoke a non-Indo-European language and their capital was around Lake Van .

[ 71 ] [ 69 ] Urartu and Phrygia fell in seventh century BC.

[ 69 ] [ 72 ] They were replaced by Carians , Lycians and Lydians .

[ 72 ] These three cultures "can be considered a reassertion of the ancient, indigenous culture of the Hattian cities of Anatolia".

[ 72 ] Before 1200 BC, there were four Greek-speaking settlements in Anatolia, including Miletus .

[ 73 ] Around 1000 BC, Greeks started migrating to the west coast of Anatolia. These eastern Greek settlements played a vital role in shaping the Archaic Greek civilization; [ 69 ] [ 74 ] important cities included Miletus , Ephesus , Halicarnassus , Smyrna (now İzmir ) and Byzantium (now Istanbul ), the latter founded by colonists from Megara in the seventh century BCE.

[ 75 ] These settlements were grouped as Aeolis , Ionia , and Doris , after the specific Greek groups that settled them.

[ 76 ] [ 77 ] Further Greek colonization in Anatolia was led by Miletus and Megara in 750–480 BC.

[ 78 ] The Greek cities along the Aegean prospered with trade, and saw remarkable scientific and scholarly accomplishments.

[ 79 ] Thales and Anaximander from Miletus founded the Ionian School of philosophy , thereby laying the foundations of rationalism and Western philosophy .

[ 80 ] The Library of Celsus in Ephesus was built by the Romans in 114–117.

[ 81 ] Cyrus attacked eastern Anatolia in 547 BC, and Achaemenid Empire eventually expanded into western Anatolia .

[ 72 ] In the east, the Armenian province was part of the Achaemenid Empire.

[ 69 ] Following the Greco-Persian Wars , the Greek city-states of the Anatolian Aegean coast regained independence, but most of the interior stayed part of the Achaemenid Empire.

[ 72 ] Two of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World , the Temple of Artemis in Ephesus, and the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus , were located in Anatolia.

[ 82 ] Following the victories of Alexander in 334 BC and 333 BC , the Achaemenid Empire collapsed and Anatolia became part of the Macedonian Empire .

[ 72 ] This led to increasing cultural homogeneity and Hellenization of the Anatolian interior, [ 83 ] [ 84 ] [ 85 ] which met resistance in some places.

[ 86 ] Following Alexander's death, the Seleucids ruled large parts of Anatolia, while native Anatolian states emerged in the Marmara and Black Sea areas. In eastern Anatolia, the kingdom of Armenia appeared. In third century BC, Celts invaded central Anatolia and continued as a major ethnic group in the area for around 200 years. They were known as the Galatians .

[ 87 ] Rome and Byzantine Empire Main articles: Classical Anatolia and Byzantine Anatolia See also: Roman Republic , Roman Empire , Christianity in Turkey , and Byzantine Empire The Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire in 555 under Justinian the Great , at its greatest extent When Pergamon requested assistance in its conflict with the Seleucids, Rome intervened in Anatolia in the second century BC. Without an heir, Pergamum's king left the kingdom to Rome, which was annexed as province of Asia . Roman influence grew in Anatolia afterwards.

[ 88 ] Following Asiatic Vespers massacre, and Mithridatic Wars with Pontus , Rome emerged victorious. Around the 1st century BC, Rome expanded into parts of Pontus and Bithynia , while turning rest of Anatolian states into Roman satellites.

[ 89 ] Several conflicts with Parthians ensued , with peace and wars alternating.

[ 90 ] According to Acts of the Apostles , early Christian Church had significant growth in Anatolia because of St Paul 's efforts. Letters from St. Paul in Anatolia comprise the oldest Christian literature .

[ 91 ] Under Roman authority, ecumenical councils such as Council of Nicaea (Iznik) in 325 served as a guide for developing "orthodox expressions of basic Christian teachings".

[ 91 ] The Hagia Sophia in Constantinople (now Istanbul ) was built by the Eastern Roman emperor Justinian the Great in 532–537.

[ 92 ] The Byzantine Empire, also referred to as the Eastern Roman Empire, was the continuation of the Roman Empire centered in Constantinople during Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages . The eastern half of the Empire survived the conditions that caused the fall of the West in the 5th century AD, and continued to exist until the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Empire in 1453. During most of its existence, the empire remained the most powerful economic, cultural, and military force in the Mediterranean world . The term Byzantine Empire was only coined following the empire's demise; its citizens referred to the polity as the "Roman Empire" and to themselves as Romans . Due to the imperial seat's move from Rome to Byzantium , the adoption of Christianity as the state religion , and the predominance of Greek instead of Latin , modern historians continue to make a distinction between the earlier Roman Empire and the later Byzantine Empire .

[ citation needed ] In the early Byzantine Empire period, the Anatolian coastal areas were Greek speaking. In addition to natives, interior Anatolia had diverse groups such as Goths , Celts , Persians and Jews . Interior Anatolia had been "heavily Hellenized".

[ 93 ] Anatolian languages eventually became extinct after Hellenization of Anatolia.

To the west, Anatolia was under the independent rule of Suleiman ibn Qutalmish as the Sultanate of Rum .

According to historians and linguists, the Proto-Turkic language originated in Central-East Asia.

[ 95 ] Initially, Proto- Turkic speakers were potentially both hunter-gatherers and farmers; they later became nomadic pastoralists .

[ 96 ] Early and medieval Turkic groups exhibited a wide range of both East Asian and West-Eurasian physical appearances and genetic origins, in part through long-term contact with neighboring peoples such as Iranic , Mongolic , Tocharian , Uralic , and Yeniseian peoples.

[ 97 ] During the 9th and 10th centuries CE, the Oghuz were a Turkic group that lived in the Caspian and Aral steppes.

[ 98 ] Partly due to pressure from the Kipchaks , the Oghuz migrated into Iran and Transoxiana .

[ 98 ] They mixed with Iranic-speaking groups in the area and converted to Islam .

[ 98 ] Oghuz Turks were also known as Turkmen or Turkoman .

[ 99 ] [ 98 ] A map of independent Turkish principalities in Anatolia during the 14th century The ruling family of the Seljuks originated from the Kınık branch of the Oghuz Turks.

[ 100 ] In 1040, the Seljuks defeated the Ghaznavids at the Battle of Dandanaqan and established the Seljuk Empire in Greater Khorasan .

[ 101 ] Baghdad , the Abbasid Caliphate 's capital and center of the Islamic world , was taken by Seljuks in 1055.

[ 99 ] Given the role Khurasani traditions played in art, culture, and political traditions in the empire, the Seljuk period is described as a mixture of " Turkish, Persian and Islamic influences ".

[ 102 ] In the latter half of the 11th century, the Seljuk Turks began penetrating into medieval Armenia and Anatolia.

[ 99 ] At the time, Anatolia was a diverse and largely Greek-speaking region after previously being Hellenized .

[ 103 ] [ 104 ] [ 93 ] The Seljuk Turks defeated the Byzantines at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071, and later established the Seljuk Sultanate of Rum .

[ 105 ] During this period, there were also Turkish principalities such as Danishmendids .

[ 106 ] Seljuk arrival started the Turkification process in Anatolia; [ 104 ] [ 65 ] there were Turkic/Turkish migrations, intermarriages, and conversions into Islam.

[ 107 ] [ 108 ] The shift took several centuries and happened gradually.

[ 109 ] [ 110 ] Members of Islamic mysticism orders, such as Mevlevi Order , played a role in the Islamization of the diverse people of Anatolia.

[ 111 ] [ 112 ] Seljuk expansion was one of the reasons for the Crusades .

[ 113 ] In 13th century, there was a second significant wave of Turkic migration, as people fled Mongol expansion.

[ 114 ] [ 115 ] Seljuk sultanate was defeated by the Mongols at the Battle of Köse Dağ in 1243 and disappeared by the beginning of the 14th century. It was replaced by various Turkish principalities.

[ 18 ] [ 116 ] Ottoman Empire Main article: Ottoman Empire The Ottoman Empire at its greatest European extent, in 1683, during the Battle of Vienna Based around Söğüt , Ottoman Beylik was founded by Osman I in the early 14th century.

[ 117 ] According to Ottoman chroniclers, Osman descended from the Kayı tribe of the Oghuz Turks .

[ 118 ] Ottomans started annexing the nearby Turkish beyliks (principalities) in Anatolia and expanded into the Balkans .

[ 119 ] Mehmed II completed Ottoman conquest of the Byzantine Empire by capturing its capital, Constantinople , on 29 May 1453.

[ 120 ] Selim I united Anatolia under Ottoman rule.

[ 121 ] Turkification continued as Ottomans mixed with various indigenous people in Anatolia and the Balkans.

[ 118 ] The Ottoman Empire was a global power during the reigns of Selim I and Suleiman the Magnificent .

[ 121 ] [ 122 ] In the 16th and 17th centuries, Sephardic Jews moved into Ottoman Empire following their expulsion from Spain.

[ 123 ] From the second half of the 18th century onwards, the Ottoman Empire began to decline . The Tanzimat reforms, initiated by Mahmud II in 1839, aimed to modernize the Ottoman state in line with the progress that had been made in Western Europe. The Ottoman constitution of 1876 was the first among Muslim states, but was short-lived .

[ 124 ] [ 125 ] Topkapı Palace and Dolmabahçe Palace were the primary residences of the Ottoman sultans in Istanbul between 1465 and 1856 [ 126 ] and 1856 to 1922, [ 127 ] respectively.

As the empire gradually shrank in size, military power and wealth; especially after the Ottoman economic crisis and default in 1875 [ 128 ] which led to uprisings in the Balkan provinces that culminated in the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878) . The decline of the Ottoman Empire led to a rise in nationalist sentiment among its various subject peoples , leading to increased ethnic tensions which occasionally burst into violence, such as the Hamidian massacres of Armenians , which claimed up to 300,000 lives.

[ 129 ] [ better source needed ] Ottoman territories in Europe ( Rumelia ) were lost in the First Balkan War (1912–1913).

[ 130 ] Ottomans managed to recover some territory in Europe, such as Edirne , in the Second Balkan War (1913).

In the 19th and early 20th centuries, persecution of Muslims during the Ottoman contraction and in the Russian Empire resulted in estimated 5 million deaths, [ 131 ] [ 132 ] with the casualties including Turks.

[ 132 ] Five to seven or seven to nine million refugees migrated into modern-day Turkey from the Balkans , Caucasus , Crimea , and Mediterranean islands, [ 133 ] shifting the center of the Ottoman Empire to Anatolia.

[ 134 ] In addition to a small number of Jews, the refugees were overwhelmingly Muslim; they were both Turkish and non-Turkish people, such as Circassians and Crimean Tatars .

[ 135 ] [ 136 ] Paul Mojzes has called the Balkan Wars an "unrecognized genocide", where multiple sides were both victims and perpetrators.

[ 137 ] Circassian refugees included the survivors of the Circassian genocide .

[ 138 ] Following the 1913 coup d'état , the Three Pashas took control of the Ottoman government. The Ottoman Empire entered World War I on the side of the Central Powers and was ultimately defeated.

[ 139 ] During the war, the empire's Armenian subjects were deported to Syria as part of the Armenian genocide .

Most of these lands were within or contiguous with the Ottoman Empire. By 1923, 'only Anatolia, eastern Thrace, and a section of the southeastern Caucasus remained to the Muslim land ...

Since people in the Ottoman Empire were classified by religion, Turks, Albanians, Bosnians, and all other Muslim groups were recognized—and recognized themselves—simply as Muslims. Hence, their persecution and forced migration is of central importance to an analysis of 'Muslim migration.'" Schayegh, Cyrus (2024).

Between 1821 and the 1919–1922 Turko-Greek War, about five and a half million Muslims died of religious-ethnic war-related causes, including disease and hunger during forced migration, in southeastern Europe and the Crimea and Caucasus.

Karpat 2001 , p. 343: "The main migrations started from Crimea in 1856 and were followed by those from the Caucasus and the Balkans in 1862 to 1878 and 1912 to 1916. These have continued to our day. The quantitative indicators cited in various sources show that during this period a total of about 7 million migrants from Crimea, the Caucasus, the Balkans, and the Mediterranean islands settled in Anatolia. These immigrants were overwhelmingly Muslim, except for a number of Jews who left their homes in the Balkans and Russia in order to live in the Ottoman lands. By the end of the century the immigrants and their descendants constituted some 30 to 40 percent of the total population of Anatolia, and in some western areas their percentage was even higher." ... "The immigrants called themselves Muslims rather than Turks, although most of those from Bulgaria, Macedonia, and eastern Serbia descended from the Turkish Anatolian stock who settled in the Balkans in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries." Karpat 2004 , pp. 5–6: "Migration was a major force in the social and cultural reconstruction of the Ottoman state in the nineteenth century. While some seven to nine million, mostly Muslim, refugees from lost territories in the Caucasus, Crimea, Balkans and Mediterranean islands migrated to Anatolia and Eastern Thrace, during the last quarter of the nineteenth and the early part of the twentieth centuries..." Pekesen 2012 : "The immigration had far-reaching social and political consequences for the Ottoman Empire and Turkey." ... "Between 1821 and 1922, some 5.3 million Muslims migrated to the Empire.50 It is estimated that in 1923, the year the republic of Turkey was founded, about 25 per cent of the population came from immigrant families.51" Biondich 2011 , p. 93: "The road from Berlin to Lausanne was littered with millions of casualties. In the period between 1878 and 1912, as many as two million Muslims emigrated voluntarily or involuntarily from the Balkans. When one adds those who were killed or expelled between 1912 and 1923, the number of Muslim casualties from the Balkan far exceeds three million. By 1923 fewer than one million remained in the Balkans" Armour 2012 , p. 213: "To top it all, the Empire was host to a steady stream of Muslim refugees. Russia between 1854 and 1876 expelled 1.4 million Crimean Tartars, and in the mid-1860s another 600,000 Circassians from the Caucasus. Their arrival produced further economic dislocation and expense." Bosma, Lucassen & Oostindie 2012a , p. 17: "In total, many millions of Turks (or, more precisely, Muslim immigrants, including some from the Caucasus) were involved in this ‘repatriation’ – sometimes more than once in a lifetime – the last stage of which may have been the immigration of seven hundred thousand Turks from Bulgaria between 1940 and 1990. Most of these immigrants settled in urban north-western Anatolia. Today between a third and a quarter of the Republic’s population are descendants of these Muslim immigrants, known as Muhacir or Göçmen" ^ Tatz, Colin; Higgins, Winton (2016).

To sum up, the palaeolinguistic reconstruction points to a mixed subsistence strategy and complex economy of the Proto-Turkic-speaking community. It is likely that the subsistence of the Early Proto-Turkic speakers was based on a combination of hunting–gathering and agriculture, with a later shift to nomadic pastoralism as an economy basis, partly owing to the interaction of the Late Proto-Turkic groups with the Iranian-speaking herders of the Eastern Steppe.

^ Lee 2023 , p. 4: "It should also be noted that even the early Turkic peoples, including the Tiele and the Türks, were made up of heterogeneous elements. Importantly, DNA studies demonstrate that the expansion process of the Turkic peoples involved the Turkicization of various non-Turkic-speaking groups. The "Turks" intermixed with and Turkicized various indigenous groups across Eurasia: Uralic hunter-gatherers in northern Eurasia; Mongolic nomads in Mongolia; Indo-European-speaking nomads and sedentary populations in Xinjiang, Transoxiana, Iran, Kazakhstan, and South Siberia; and Indo-European elements (the Byzantine subjects, among others) in Anatolia and the Balkans.11" Findley 2005 , p. 18: "Moreover, Turks do not all physically look alike. They never did. The Turks of Turkey are famous for their range of physical types. Given the Turks' ancient Inner Asian origins, it is easy to imagine that they once presented a uniform Mongoloid appearance. Such traits seem to be more characteristic in the eastern Turkic world; however, uniformity of type can never have prevailed there either. Archeological evidence indicates that Indo-Europeans, or certainly Europoid physical types, inhabited the oases of the Tarim basin and even parts of Mongolia in ancient times. In the Tarim basin, persistence of these former inhabitants' genes among the modern Uyghurs is both observable and scientifically demonstrable.32 Early Chinese sources describe the Kirghiz as blue-eyed and blond or red-haired. The genesis of Turkic ethnic groups from earliest times occurred in confederations of diverse peoples. As if to prove the point, the earliest surviving texts in Turkic languages are studded with terms from other languages." Golden, Peter B. (25 July 2018).

"Some DNA tests point to the Iranian connections of the Ashina and Ashide,133 highlighting further that the Turks as a whole 'were made up of heterogeneous and somatically dissimilar populations'.134 Geographically, the accounts cover the regions of Inner Mongolia, Gansu, Xinjiang, the Yenisei zone and the Altay, regions with Turkic, Indo-European (Iranian [Saka] and Tokharian), Yeniseic, Uralic and other populations. Wusun elements, like most steppe polities of an ethno-linguistic mix, may have also played a substratal role." Lee, Joo-Yup; Kuang, Shuntu (18 October 2017).
