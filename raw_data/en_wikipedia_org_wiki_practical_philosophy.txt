For the Gilles Deleuze's book Spinoza: Practical Philosophy , see Spinoza: Practical Philosophy .

Practical philosophy concerns itself mainly with subjects that have applications in life, like the study of values, norms, politics, art, etc.

[ 1 ] The modern division of philosophy into theoretical philosophy and practical philosophy [ 2 ] [ 3 ] has its origin in Aristotle 's categories of natural and moral philosophy .

[ 4 ] The one has theory for its object, and the other practice .

[ 2 ] Subjects of practical philosophy [ edit ] Examples of practical philosophy subjects are: Ethics Aesthetics Decision theory Political philosophy Philosophical counseling [ edit ] Main article: Philosophical counseling Practical philosophy is also the use of philosophy and philosophical techniques in everyday life. This can take a number of forms including reflective practice, personal philosophical thinking, and philosophical counseling .

Examples of philosophical counseling subjects include: Philosophical counseling Philosophy of education Philosophy of law Philosophy of religion Philosophy of history Philosophy of social science Value theory Reflective practice University education [ edit ] In Sweden [ 5 ] and Finland courses in theoretical and practical philosophy are taught separately, and are separate degrees. Other countries may use a similar scheme—some Scottish universities, for example, divide philosophy into logic , metaphysics , and ethics —but in most universities around the world philosophy is taught as a single subject. There is also a unified philosophy subject in some Swedish universities, such as Södertörns Högskola .
