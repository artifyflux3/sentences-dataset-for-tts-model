It was known as UK PubMed Central until 1 November 2012.

[ 2 ] Service [ edit ] Europe PMC provides free access to more than 9.3 million full-text biomedical and life sciences research articles and over 43.3 million citations.

[ 3 ] Europe PMC contains some citation information and includes text mining based marked up text that links to external molecular and medical datasets.

[ 1 ] [ 4 ] The Europe PMC funders group requires that articles describing the results of biomedical and life sciences research they have supported be made freely available in Europe PMC within 6 months of publication to maximise the impact of the work that they fund.

[ 5 ] The Grant Lookup facility allows users to search for information in a wide variety of different ways on over 101,900 grants awarded by the Europe PMC funders.

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] Most content is mirrored from PubMed Central , which manages the deposit of entire books and journals.

[ 8 ] Additionally, Europe PMC offers a manuscript submission system, Europe PMC plus, [ 9 ] which allows scientists to self-deposit their peer-reviewed research articles for inclusion in the Europe PMC collection.

[ 10 ] Organisation [ edit ] The Europe PMC project was originally launched in 2007 as the first 'mirror' site to PMC, which aims to provide international preservation of the open and free-access biomedical and life sciences literature. It forms part of a network of PMC International [ 11 ] (PMCI) repositories that includes PubMed Central Canada . Europe PMC is not an exact "mirror" of the PMC database but has developed some different features.

[ 1 ] [ 4 ] On 15 February 2013 CiteXplore was subsumed under Europe PubMed Central.

[ 12 ] The resource is managed and developed by the European Molecular Biology Laboratory - European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), on behalf of an alliance of 27 biomedical and life sciences research funders, led by the Wellcome Trust .

[ 5 ] Europe PMC is supported by 27 organisations: Academy of Medical Sciences , Action on Hearing Loss , Alzheimer's Society , Arthritis Research UK , Austrian Science Fund (FWF), the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council , Blood Cancer UK , Breast Cancer Now , the British Heart Foundation , Cancer Research UK , the Chief Scientist Office of the Scottish Executive Health Department , Diabetes UK , the Department of Health , the Dunhill Medical Trust, the European Research Council , Marie Curie , the Medical Research Council , the Motor Neurone Disease Association , the Multiple Sclerosis Society , the Myrovlytis Trust, the National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research (NC3Rs), Parkinson's UK , Prostate Cancer UK , Telethon Italy, the Wellcome Trust , the World Health Organization and Worldwide Cancer Research (formerly Association for International Cancer Research ).
