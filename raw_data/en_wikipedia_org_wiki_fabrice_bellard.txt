He developed Bellard's formula for calculating single digits of pi . In 2012, Bellard co-founded Amarisoft, a telecommunications company, with Franck Spinelli.

Life and career [ edit ] Bellard was born in 1972 in Grenoble , France and went to school in Lycée Joffre (Montpellier), where, at age 17, he created the executable compressor LZEXE.

[ 2 ] After studying at École Polytechnique , he went on to specialize at Télécom Paris in 1996.

In 1997, he discovered a new, faster formula to calculate single digits of pi in hexadecimal representation, known as Bellard's formula . It is a variant of the Bailey–Borwein–Plouffe formula .

Bellard's entries won the International Obfuscated C Code Contest three times.

[ 3 ] In 2000, he won in the category "Most Specific Output" [ 4 ] for a program that implemented the modular fast Fourier transform and used it to compute the then biggest known prime number , 2 6972593 −1 (in the sense that it prints the decimal representation of this number, which itself is assumed to be known).

[ 5 ] In 2001, he won in the category "Best Abuse of the Rules" for a tiny compiler (the source code being only 3 kB in size) of a strict subset of the C language for i386 Linux . The program itself is written in this language subset, i.e. it is self-hosting .  In 2018, he won in the category "Most inflationary" [ 6 ] for an image decompression program.

[ 7 ] In 2002, he developed TinyGL, a subset of OpenGL suitable for embedded environments.

In 2003, he pushed the first commits of QEMU , developing it solo through v0.7.1 in 2005.

[ 8 ] In 2004, he wrote the TinyCC Boot Loader, which can compile and boot a Linux kernel from source in less than 15 seconds.

[ 9 ] In 2005, he designed a system that could act as an Analog or DVB-T Digital TV transmitter by directly generating a VHF signal from a standard PC and VGA card.

[ 10 ] In 2011, he created a minimal PC emulator written in pure JavaScript . The emulated hardware consists of a 32-bit x86 compatible CPU , a 8259 Programmable Interrupt Controller , a 8254 Programmable Interrupt Timer , and a 16450 UART .

[ 11 ] On 31 December 2009, he claimed the world record for calculations of pi, having calculated it to nearly 2.7 trillion places in 90 days.

Slashdot wrote: "While the improvement may seem small, it is an outstanding achievement because only a single desktop PC, costing less than US$3,000, was used—instead of a multi-million dollar supercomputer as in the previous records." [ 12 ] [ 13 ] On 2 August 2010, this record was eclipsed by Shigeru Kondo who computed 5 trillion digits, although this was done using a server-class machine running dual Intel Xeon processors, equipped with 96 GB of RAM.

In 2011, he won an O'Reilly Open Source Award .

[ 14 ] In 2014, he proposed the Better Portable Graphics (BPG) image format as a replacement for JPEG .

[ 15 ] In July 2019, he released QuickJS, a small and embeddable JavaScript engine.

[ 16 ] In April 2021, his artificial neural network –based data compressor, NNCP, took first place out of hundreds in the Large Text Compression Benchmark.

[ 17 ] The compressor uses Bellard's own artificial neural network library, LibNC ("C Library for Tensor Manipulation"), which is publicly available.

[ 18 ] In August 2023, Bellard released ts_zip, a lossless text compressor using large language models .

[ 19 ] [ 20 ] He updated it in March 2024, making the algorithm considerably faster as well as hardware-independent.

[ 21 ] In April 2024, Bellard released TSAC, an audio compression utility that can achieve very low bitrates of 5.5kb/s (mono) or 7.5kb/s (stereo) while still preserving reasonable audio quality at 44.1kHz.
