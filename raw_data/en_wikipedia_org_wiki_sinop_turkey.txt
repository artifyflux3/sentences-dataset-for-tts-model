It is the seat of Sinop Province and Sinop District .

[ 2 ] Its population is 57,404 (2022).

Over a period of approximately 2,500 years, Sinope has at various times been settled by Colchians and then the Greeks (in the late 7th, late 5th, and 4th–3rd centuries BC) and by Turkic people beginning in the 13th century. In the 19th and 20th centuries it was also settled by the muhacir who immigrated from the Balkans and Caucasus .

[ 3 ] The Greek colony of Sinope ( Greek : Σινώπη , romanized : Sinṓpē ) was founded by Ionians from the city of Miletus .

[ 4 ] Sinope issued its own coinage, founded colonies, and gave its name to a red earth pigment called sinopia , which was mined in Cappadocia for use throughout the ancient world.

[ 5 ] Some scholars have dated the earliest Greek colonization of Sinope to the 7th c. BC, while others have proposed an earlier date in the 8th c. While literary evidence exists supporting earlier settlement, archaeological evidence has been found of Greek settlement around the Black Sea region beginning in the late 7th century.

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] Sinope was strategically located among the trade routes that were developing on the southern Coast of the Black Sea, but remained relatively isolated from other inland communities until the 4th century BC.

[ 3 ] [ 8 ] There is literary evidence of early links between Colchis and Sinope in mythological tradition.

Strabo ' s writings link the legendary founder of Sinope, Autolycus , with Jason and the Argonauts .

Polybius described Sinope as being "on the way to Phasis ".

[ 9 ] The Persian Achaemenid Empire ' s northward expansion in the 4th century disrupted Sinope's control over its eastern colonies, including Trapezus (present day Trabzon). The satrap Datames briefly occupied the city around 375 BC.

[ 10 ] [ 11 ] There is archaeological evidence of increased economic activity between the port city of Sinope and the surrounding inland areas during between 4th and 1st c. BC. Sinope appears to have maintained its independence from the dominion of Alexander the Great , and with the help of Rhodes turned back an assault led by Mithridates II of Pontus in 220 BC. Sinope eventually fell to Pharnaces I in 183 BC, after which it became the capital of the Pontic Kingdom .

[ 3 ] [ 11 ] Sinope is the birthplace of the famous Greek philosopher Diogenes .

The Roman general Lucullus conquered Sinope in 70 BC, and Julius Caesar established a Roman colony there, Colonia Julia Felix, in 47 BC.

Mithradates Eupator was born and buried at Sinope, and it was the birthplace of Diogenes ; of Diphilus , poet and actor of the New Attic comedy ; of the historian Baton ; and of the second-century Christian heretic Marcion .

After the division of the Roman Empire in 395, Sinope remained with the Eastern Roman Empire . Its history in the early Byzantine period is obscure, except for isolated events: it was used by Justinian II as a base from which to reconnoitre Cherson , participated in the rebellion of the Armeniac Theme in 793, was the site of Theophobos ' proclamation as emperor by his Khurramite troops in 838, and suffered its only attack by the Arabs in 858.

[ 12 ] In 1081, the city was captured by the Seljuk Turks , who found there a sizeable treasury, but Sinope was soon recovered by Alexios I Komnenos , ushering a period of prosperity under the Komnenian dynasty .

[ 12 ] After the sacking of Constantinople by the Fourth Crusade in 1204, it was captured for the Empire of Trebizond by David Komnenos , until the Seljuk Turks of Rûm successfully captured the city in 1214.

[ 12 ] [ 13 ] The city returned briefly to Trapezuntine rule in 1254, but returned to Turkish control in 1265, where it has remained since.

[ 12 ] After 1265, Sinop became home to two successive independent emirates following the fall of the Seljuks: the Pervâne and the Jandarids . During his march on Trebizond , the Ottoman Sultan Mehmet II overawed Ismail, the emir of Sinop, and forced him to surrender the city without a fight. Mehmet took possession in late June 1461, exiling Ismail to Philippopolis (modern Plovdiv ) in northern Thrace.

[ 14 ] Ibn Battuta visited the city and stayed for about forty days.  He noted it was "a superb city which combines fortification with beautification." [ 15 ] In 1614, Sinop was targeted by Cossack raiders and extensively looted and burned in an event which shocked Ottoman contemporaries.

[ 16 ] In November 1853, at the start of the Crimean War , in the Battle of Sinop , the Russians , under the command of Admiral Nakhimov , destroyed an Ottoman frigate squadron in Sinop, leading Britain and France to declare war on Russia.

In the late 19th and early 20th century, Sinop was part of the Kastamonu Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire .

As of 1920, Sinop was described as populated mainly by Greeks with an approximate population of 8,000. It was also considered the "safest" port "between Bosphorus and Batum ", at the time. During this period, the port was exporting wheat , tobacco , seeds, timber and hides. They imported produce, coal and hardware.

[ 17 ] The Greek inhabitants left in 1923 after the Population Exchange between Greece and Turkey, with many settling in Nea Sinopi .

Sinop hosted a US military base and radar that was important for intelligence during the Cold War era .

[ 18 ] The US base was closed in 1992.

Explorer Robert Ballard discovered an ancient ship wreck north west of Sinop in the Black Sea and was shown on National Geographic .

Greek coins featuring an eagle holding a dolphin or marine animal in its talons have been found in Sinope, Istria and Olbia . Located in present-day Turkey, Romania and Ukraine respectively, all three were colonies of Miletus. The coins circulated between c. 450 and 325 BC.

[ 19 ] Coins of the "Sinope type" continued to be issued by Persians under Achaemenid rule in the 4th century BC. At least two Persian issuers of such coins have been studied in some detail: the satrap Datames in Cappadocia and Ariarathes .

[ 20 ] Geography [ edit ] Sinop is located on a promontory at the narrowest point of the Black Sea. It has two harbors and is located along the southern shore of the Black Sea, near the shortest crossing to the Crimea . The nearby mountainous terrain is green and noted for its timber .

[ 3 ] [ 11 ] Climate [ edit ] Sinop has a humid subtropical climate ( Köppen : Cfa, Trewartha : Cf ).
