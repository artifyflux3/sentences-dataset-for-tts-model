Machine translation, like DeepL or Google Translate , is a useful starting point for translations, but translators must revise errors as necessary and confirm that the translation is accurate, rather than simply copy-pasting machine-translated text into the English Wikipedia.

[ 1 ] Genetic resources is one of the three levels of biodiversity defined by the Convention on Biological Diversity in Rio, 1992.

Examples [ edit ] Animal genetic resources for food and agriculture Forest genetic resources Germplasm , genetic resources that are preserved for various purposes such as breeding, preservation, and research Plant genetic resources Genetic resources conservation and sustainable use See also [ edit ] Cryoconservation of animal genetic resources , a strategy to preserve genetic resources cryogenically Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture , the only permanent intergovernmental body that addresses biological diversity for food and agriculture International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture , an international agreement to promote sustainable use of the world's plant genetic resources Gene bank , a type of biorepository which preserves genetic material Genetic diversity The State of the World's Animal Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture References [ edit ] ^ Unit, Biosafety (2006-11-02).
