They shared an interest in the scientific and philosophical insights of Ernst Mach . Many, but not all, of the Russian Machists were Marxists, and some viewed Machism as an essential ingredient of a materialist outlook on the world. The term came into use around 1905, primarily as a polemical expression used by Lenin and Georgi Plekhanov . With a shared desire to defend an "orthodox" account of Marxism, from their own differing perspective they both divided the opponents of this putative orthodoxy into the "idealists" and the "Machists".

[ 1 ] The term remained a signifier of Marxist-Leninist opprobrium from the 1920s through into the 1970s. This was shown by Alexander Maximov [ ru ] 's use of the term to criticize Boris Hessen in 1928.

[ 2 ] It can also be seen in Evald Ilyenkov 's chapter on "Marxism against Machism as the Philosophy of Lifeless Reaction" in Leninist Dialectics and the Metaphysics of Positivism (1979).

[ 3 ] Confrontation with idealism [ edit ] In 1902 Pavel Ivanovich Novgorodtsev edited the book Problems of Idealism ( Problemy Idealizma ) which included contributions from Sergei Bulgakov , Evgenii Nikolaevitch Troubetzkoy , Sergei Nikolaevich Trubetskoy , Peter Berngardovich Struve , Nikolai Berdyaev , Semyon Frank , Sergei Askol'dov [ ru ] , Bogdan Kistyakovski , Alexander Sergeyevich Lappo-Danilevsky , Sergey Oldenburg , and Zhukovsky.

[ 4 ] In proclaiming the advent of a new idealist movement he also derided positivism as being narrow and dogmatic.

[ 5 ] Lenin, who was a materialist , explains the difference between philosophical  idealism and philosophical materialism as follows: "Materialism is the recognition of 'objects in themselves' or objects outside the mind; the ideas and sensations are copies or images of these objects. The opposite doctrine (idealism) says: the objects do not exist, outside the mind…” [ 6 ] Confrontation with Lenin [ edit ] The publication of Studies in the Philosophy of Marxism (Russian: Очерки по философии Марксизма) in 1908 marked a key moment in the emergence of this Russian Machism. However whilst many of the proponents of Russian Machism saw it as adding important insights to what a materialist view of the world would look like, Vladimir Lenin was a consistent opponent, writing Materialism and Empirio-criticism to refute their ideas. Lenin cited as supporters of Machism: Bazarov, Bogdanov, Lunacharski, Berman, Gelfond, Yushkevich, Sergei Suvorov and Nikolai Valentinov .
