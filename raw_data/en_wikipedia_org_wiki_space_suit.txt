A **space suit** (or **spacesuit**) is an [environmental suit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_suit "Environmental suit") used for protection from the harsh [environment of](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_environment "Space environment")[outer space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_space "Outer space"), mainly from its [vacuum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_(outer_space) "Vacuum (outer space)") as a highly specialized [pressure suit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure_suit "Pressure suit"), but also its temperature extremes, as well as [radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_ionizing_radiation_in_spaceflight "Effects of ionizing radiation in spaceflight") and [micrometeoroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micrometeoroid "Micrometeoroid"). Basic space suits are worn as a safety precaution inside [spacecrafts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft "Spacecraft") in case of loss of [cabin pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabin_pressure "Cabin pressure"). For [extravehicular activity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_activity "Extravehicular activity") (EVA) more complex space suits are worn, featuring a [portable life support system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_life_support_system "Portable life support system").

Pressure suits are in general needed at low pressure environments above the [Armstrong limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armstrong_limit "Armstrong limit"), at around 19,000 m (62,000 ft) above Earth. Space suits augment pressure suits with complex system of equipment and environmental systems designed to keep the wearer comfortable, and to minimize the effort required to bend the limbs, resisting a soft pressure garment's natural tendency to stiffen against the vacuum. A self-contained [oxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen "Oxygen") supply and environmental control system is frequently employed to allow complete freedom of movement, independent of the spacecraft.

Three types of space suits exist for different purposes: IVA (intravehicular activity), EVA (extravehicular activity), and IEVA (intra/extravehicular activity). IVA suits are meant to be worn inside a pressurized spacecraft, and are therefore lighter and more comfortable. IEVA suits are meant for use inside and outside the spacecraft, such as the [Gemini G4C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_space_suit "Gemini space suit") suit. They include more protection from the harsh conditions of space, such as protection from micrometeoroids and extreme temperature change. EVA suits, such as the [EMU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_Mobility_Unit "Extravehicular Mobility Unit"), are used outside spacecraft, for either planetary exploration or spacewalks. They must protect the wearer against all conditions of space, as well as provide mobility and functionality.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit#cite_note-thomas-1)

The first full-pressure suits for use at extreme altitudes were designed by individual inventors as early as the 1930s. The first space suit worn by a human in space was the [Soviet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union")[SK-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SK-1_spacesuit "SK-1 spacesuit") suit worn by [Yuri Gagarin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuri_Gagarin "Yuri Gagarin") in 1961. Since then space suits have been worn beside in Earth orbit, en-route and on the surface of the [Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon "Moon").

Requirements
------------

[![Image 4](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/STS-116_spacewalk_1.jpg/250px-STS-116_spacewalk_1.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:STS-116_spacewalk_1.jpg)

Space suits being used to work on the International Space Station.

A space suit must perform several functions to allow its occupant to work safely and comfortably, inside or outside a spacecraft. It must provide:

*   A stable internal pressure. This can be less than Earth's atmosphere, as there is usually no need for the space suit to carry [nitrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen "Nitrogen") (which comprises about 78% of Earth's atmosphere and is not used by the body). Lower pressure allows for greater mobility, but requires the suit occupant to breathe pure oxygen for a time before going into this lower pressure, to avoid [decompression sickness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decompression_sickness "Decompression sickness").
*   Mobility. Movement is typically opposed by the pressure of the suit; mobility is achieved by careful joint design. See the _[Design concepts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space\_suit#Design\_concepts)_ section.
*   Supply of breathable oxygen and elimination of [carbon dioxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide "Carbon dioxide"); these gases are exchanged with the spacecraft or a [Portable Life Support System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_Life_Support_System "Primary Life Support System") (PLSS)
*   Temperature regulation. Unlike on Earth, where heat can be transferred by [convection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convection "Convection") to the atmosphere, in space, heat can be lost only by [thermal radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation "Thermal radiation") or by [conduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_conduction "Heat conduction") to objects in physical contact with the exterior of the suit. Since the temperature on the outside of the suit varies greatly between sunlight and shadow, the suit is heavily insulated, and air temperature is maintained at a comfortable level.
*   A communication system, with external electrical connection to the spacecraft or PLSS
*   Means of collecting and containing solid and liquid bodily waste (such as a [Maximum Absorbency Garment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_Absorbency_Garment "Maximum Absorbency Garment"))

### Secondary requirements

Lucid—The first six female astronauts of the United States stand with a [Personal Rescue Enclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_Rescue_Enclosure "Personal Rescue Enclosure"), a spherical life support ball for emergency transfer of people in space

Advanced suits better regulate the [astronaut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut "Astronaut")'s temperature with a [Liquid Cooling and Ventilation Garment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_Cooling_and_Ventilation_Garment "Liquid Cooling and Ventilation Garment") (LCVG) in contact with the astronaut's skin, from which the heat is dumped into space through an external radiator in the PLSS.

Additional requirements for EVA include:

*   Shielding against [ultraviolet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet "Ultraviolet") radiation
*   Limited shielding against [particle radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_radiation "Particle radiation")
*   Means to maneuver, dock, release, and tether onto a spacecraft
*   Protection against small [micrometeoroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micrometeoroid "Micrometeoroid"), some traveling at up to 27,000 kilometers per hour, provided by a puncture-resistant [Thermal Micrometeoroid Garment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_Micrometeoroid_Garment "Thermal Micrometeoroid Garment"), which is the outermost layer of the suit. Experience has shown the greatest chance of exposure occurs near the [gravitational field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_field "Gravitational field") of a moon or planet, so these were first employed on the [Apollo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_program "Apollo program") lunar EVA suits (see _[United States suit models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space\_suit#United\_States\_suit\_models)_ below).

Layers of a space suit

As part of [astronautical hygiene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronautical_hygiene "Astronautical hygiene") control (i.e., protecting astronauts from extremes of temperature, radiation, etc.), a space suit is essential for extravehicular activity. The [Apollo/Skylab A7L](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo/Skylab_A7L "Apollo/Skylab A7L") suit included eleven layers in all: an inner liner, a LCVG, a pressure bladder, a restraint layer, another liner, and a Thermal Micrometeoroid Garment consisting of five aluminized insulation layers and an external layer of white Ortho-Fabric. This space suit is capable of protecting the astronaut from temperatures ranging from −156°C (−249°F) to 121°C (250°F).[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit#cite_note-2)

During exploration of the Moon or Mars, there will be the potential for lunar or Martian dust to be retained on the space suit. When the space suit is removed on return to the spacecraft, there will be the potential for the dust to contaminate surfaces and increase the risks of inhalation and skin exposure. Astronautical hygienists are testing materials with reduced dust retention times and the potential to control the dust exposure risks during planetary exploration. Novel ingress and egress approaches, such as [suitports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suitport "Suitport"), are being explored as well.

In [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA "NASA") space suits, communications are provided via a cap worn over the head, which includes earphones and a microphone. Due to the coloration of the version used for Apollo and [Skylab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skylab "Skylab"), which resembled the coloration of the comic strip character [Snoopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snoopy "Snoopy"), these caps became known as "[Snoopy caps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snoopy_cap "Snoopy cap")".

### Operating pressure

[![Image 8](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/Prebreathe.jpg/250px-Prebreathe.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Prebreathe.jpg)

Astronaut [Steven G. MacLean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_MacLean_(astronaut) "Steve MacLean (astronaut)") pre-breathes prior to an EVA

Generally, to supply enough oxygen for [respiration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system "Respiratory system"), a space suit using pure oxygen must have a pressure of about 32.4 kPa (240 Torr; 4.7 psi), equal to the 20.7 kPa (160 Torr; 3.0 psi) [partial pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_pressure "Partial pressure") of oxygen in the [Earth's atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_atmosphere "Earth's atmosphere") at sea level, plus 5.3 kPa (40 Torr; 0.77 psi) CO 2[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] and 6.3[kPa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(unit) "Pascal (unit)") (47[Torr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torr "Torr"); 0.91[psi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_per_square_inch "Pound per square inch")) [water vapor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_vapor "Water vapor") pressure, both of which must be subtracted from the [alveolar pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_gas_pressures "Pulmonary gas pressures") to get alveolar oxygen partial pressure in 100% oxygen atmospheres, by the [alveolar gas equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alveolar_gas_equation "Alveolar gas equation").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit#cite_note-3) The latter two figures add to 11.6 kPa (87 Torr; 1.7 psi), which is why many modern space suits do not use 20.7 kPa (160 Torr; 3.0 psi), but 32.4 kPa (240 Torr; 4.7 psi) (this is a slight overcorrection, as alveolar partial pressures at sea level are slightly less than the former). In space suits that use 20.7 kPa, the astronaut gets only 20.7 kPa − 11.6 kPa = 9.1 kPa (68 Torr; 1.3 psi) of oxygen, which is about the alveolar oxygen partial pressure attained at an altitude of 1,860 m (6,100 ft) above sea level. This is about 42% of normal partial pressure of oxygen at sea level, about the same as [pressure in a commercial passenger jet aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabin_pressurization#Aircraft "Cabin pressurization"), and is the realistic lower limit for safe ordinary space suit pressurization which allows reasonable capacity for work.

#### Oxygen prebreathing

When space suits below a specific operating pressure are used from craft that are pressurized to normal [atmospheric pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_pressure "Atmospheric pressure") (such as the [Space Shuttle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle "Space Shuttle")), this requires astronauts to "pre-breathe" (meaning pre-breathe pure oxygen for a period) before donning their suits and depressurizing in the air lock. This procedure purges the body of dissolved nitrogen, so as to avoid decompression sickness due to rapid depressurization from a nitrogen-containing atmosphere.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit#cite_note-thomas-1)

In the US space shuttle, cabin pressure was reduced from normal atmospheric to 70kPa (equivalent to an altitude of about 3000m) for 24 hours before EVA, and after donning the suit, a pre-breathing period of 45 minutes on pure oxygen before decompressing to the EMU working pressure of 30kPa. In the ISS there is no cabin pressure reduction, instead a 4-hour oxygen pre-breathe at normal cabin pressure is used to desaturate nitrogen to an acceptable level. US studies show that a rapid decompression from 101kPa to 55kPa has an acceptable risk, and Russian studies show that direct decompression from 101kPa to 40kPa after 30 minutes of oxygen pre-breathing, roughly the time required for pre-EVA suit checks, is acceptable.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit#cite_note-thomas-1)

### Physiological effects of unprotected space exposure

The human body can briefly survive the hard vacuum of space unprotected,[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit#cite_note-Bellows2006-4) despite contrary depictions in some popular [science fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction "Science fiction"). Consciousness is retained for up to 15 seconds as the effects of [oxygen starvation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia_(medical) "Hypoxia (medical)") set in. No snap freeze effect occurs because all heat must be lost through [thermal radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation "Thermal radiation") or the [evaporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaporation "Evaporation") of liquids, and the blood does not boil because it remains pressurized within the body, but human flesh expands up to about twice its volume due to [ebullism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebullism "Ebullism") in such conditions, giving the visual effect of a body builder rather than an overfilled balloon.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit#cite_note-Springel_2013-5)

In space, there are highly energized [subatomic particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subatomic_particle "Subatomic particle") that can cause [radiation damage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_damage "Radiation damage") by disrupting essential biological processes. Exposure to radiation can create problems via two methods: the particles can react with water in the human body to produce [free radicals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_radicals "Free radicals") that break DNA molecules apart, or by directly breaking the DNA molecules.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit#cite_note-thomas-1)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit#cite_note-6)

Temperature in space can vary extremely depending on the exposure to radiant energy sources. Temperatures from solar radiation can reach up to 250°F (121°C), and in its absence, down to −387°F (−233°C). Because of this, space suits must provide sufficient insulation and cooling for the conditions in which they will be used.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit#cite_note-thomas-1)

The vacuum environment of space has no pressure, so gases will expand and exposed liquids may evaporate. Some solids may [sublimate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublimation_(phase_transition) "Sublimation (phase transition)"). It is necessary to wear a suit that provides sufficient internal body pressure in space.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit#cite_note-thomas-1)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit#cite_note-7) The most immediate hazard is in attempting to hold one's breath during [explosive decompression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncontrolled_decompression#Explosive_decompression "Uncontrolled decompression") as the expansion of gas can damage the lungs by overexpansion rupture. These effects have been confirmed through various accidents (including in very-high-altitude conditions, outer space and training [vacuum chambers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_chamber "Vacuum chamber")).[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit#cite_note-Bellows2006-4)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit#cite_note-8) Human skin does not need to be protected from vacuum and is gas-tight by itself.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit#cite_note-Springel_2013-5) It only needs to be mechanically restrained to retain its normal shape and the internal tissues to retain their volume. This can be accomplished with a tight-fitting elastic body suit and a [helmet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmet "Helmet") for containing [breathing gases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathing_gas "Breathing gas"), known as a [space activity suit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_activity_suit "Space activity suit") (SAS).[_[clarification needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please\_clarify "Wikipedia:Please clarify")_][_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

Design concepts
---------------

[![Image 9](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Space_suit_patch.jpg/250px-Space_suit_patch.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Space_suit_patch.jpg)

NASA's Extravehicular Mobility Unit _[Vitruvian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitruvian\_Man "Vitruvian Man") Spaceman_ patch ([Space Shuttle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle "Space Shuttle") version, with three stars representing NASA's [human spaceflight programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight_programs "Human spaceflight programs"))

A space suit should allow its user natural unencumbered movement. Nearly all designs try to maintain a constant volume no matter what movements the wearer makes. This is because [mechanical work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(physics) "Work (physics)") is needed to change the volume of a constant pressure system. If flexing a joint reduces the volume of the space suit, then the astronaut must do extra work every time they bend that joint, and they have to maintain a force to keep the joint bent. Even if this force is very small, it can be seriously fatiguing to constantly fight against one's suit. It also makes delicate movements very difficult. The work required to bend a joint is dictated by the formula

![Image 10: {\displaystyle W=\int _{V_{i}}^{V_{f}}\,P\,dV}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e2dfae708a68e60037b242a1aad95c34162511d1)
where _V i_ and _V f_ are respectively the initial and final volume of the joint, _P_ is the pressure in the suit, and _W_ is the resultant work. It is generally true that all suits are more mobile at lower pressures. However, because a minimum internal pressure is dictated by life support requirements, the only means of further reducing work is to minimize the change in volume.

All space suit designs try to minimize or eliminate this problem. The most common solution is to form the suit out of multiple layers. The bladder layer is a rubbery, airtight layer much like a balloon. The restraint layer goes outside the bladder, and provides a specific shape for the suit. Since the bladder layer is larger than the restraint layer, the restraint takes all of the stresses caused by the pressure inside the suit. Since the bladder is not under pressure, it will not "pop" like a balloon, even if punctured. The restraint layer is shaped in such a way that bending a joint causes pockets of fabric, called "gores", to open up on the outside of the joint, while folds called "convolutes" fold up on the inside of the joint. The gores make up for the volume lost on the inside of the joint, and keep the suit at a nearly constant volume. However, once the gores are opened all the way, the joint cannot be bent any further without a considerable amount of work.

In some Russian space suits, strips of cloth were wrapped tightly around the [cosmonaut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut#Cosmonaut "Astronaut")'s arms and legs outside the space suit to stop the space suit from ballooning when in space.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

The outermost layer of a space suit, the Thermal Micrometeoroid Garment, provides thermal insulation, protection from micrometeoroids, and shielding from harmful [solar radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunlight "Sunlight").

There are four main conceptual approaches to suit design:

### Soft suits

Soft suits typically are made mostly of fabrics. All soft suits have some hard parts; some even have hard joint bearings. Intra-vehicular activity and early EVA suits were soft suits.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

### Hard-shell suits

[![Image 11](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/AX-5-spacesuit.jpg/250px-AX-5-spacesuit.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:AX-5-spacesuit.jpg)

NASA's experimental AX-5 hard-shell space suit (1988)

Hard-shell suits are usually made of metal or composite materials and do not use fabric for joints. Hard suits joints use ball bearings and wedge-ring segments similar to an adjustable elbow of a stove pipe to allow a wide range of movement with the arms and legs. The joints maintain a constant volume of air internally and do not have any counter-force. Therefore, the astronaut does not need to exert to hold the suit in any position. Hard suits can also operate at higher pressures which would eliminate the need for an astronaut to pre-breathe oxygen to use a 34 kPa (4.9 psi) space suit before an EVA from a 101 kPa (14.6 psi) spacecraft cabin. The joints may get into a restricted or locked position requiring the astronaut to manipulate or program the joint.[_[clarification needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please\_clarify "Wikipedia:Please clarify")_] The NASA [Ames Research Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ames_Research_Center "Ames Research Center") experimental [AX-5 hard-shell space suit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=AX-5_hard-shell_space_suit&action=edit&redlink=1 "AX-5 hard-shell space suit (page does not exist)") had a flexibility rating of 95%. The wearer could move into 95% of the positions they could without the suit on.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

### Hybrid suits

Hybrid suits have hard-shell parts and fabric parts. NASA's Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) uses a fiberglass [Hard Upper Torso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_Upper_Torso "Hard Upper Torso") (HUT) and fabric limbs.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_][ILC Dover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ILC_Dover "ILC Dover")'s [I-Suit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I-Suit "I-Suit") replaces the HUT with a fabric soft upper torso to save weight, restricting the use of hard components to the joint bearings, helmet, waist seal, and rear entry hatch.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] Virtually all workable space suit designs incorporate hard components, particularly at interfaces such as the waist seal, bearings, and in the case of rear-entry suits, the back hatch, where all-soft alternatives are not viable.

### Skintight suits

Skintight suits, also known as mechanical counterpressure suits or space activity suits, are a proposed design which would use a heavy elastic body stocking to compress the body. The head is in a pressurized helmet, but the rest of the body is pressurized only by the elastic effect of the suit. This mitigates the constant volume problem,[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] reduces the possibility of a space suit depressurization and gives a very lightweight suit. When not worn, the elastic garments may appear to be that of clothing for a small child. These suits may be very difficult to put on and face problems with providing a uniform pressure. Most proposals use the body's natural [perspiration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspiration "Perspiration") to keep cool. Sweat evaporates readily in vacuum and may [desublime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deposition_(phase_transition) "Deposition (phase transition)") or deposit on objects nearby: optics, sensors, the astronaut's visor, and other surfaces. The icy film and sweat residue may contaminate sensitive surfaces and affect optical performance.

Contributing technologies
-------------------------

Related preceding technologies include the [stratonautical space suit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratonautical_space_suit "Stratonautical space suit"), the [gas mask](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWII_gas_mask "WWII gas mask") used in [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II"), the [oxygen mask](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_mask "Oxygen mask") used by pilots of high-flying bombers in World War II, the high-altitude or vacuum suit required by pilots of the [Lockheed U-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_U-2 "Lockheed U-2") and [SR-71 Blackbird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_SR-71_Blackbird "Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird"), the [diving suit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diving_suit "Diving suit"), [rebreather](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebreather "Rebreather"), [scuba diving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuba_diving "Scuba diving") gear, and many others.

Many space suit designs are taken from the U.S. Air Force suits, which are designed to work in "high-altitude aircraft pressure[s]",[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit#cite_note-thomas-1) such as the [Mercury IVA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navy_Mark_IV "Navy Mark IV") suit or the Gemini G4C, or the [Advanced Crew Escape Suits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Crew_Escape_Suit "Advanced Crew Escape Suit").[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit#cite_note-nasa-9)

### Glove technology

The Mercury IVA, the first U.S. space suit design, included lights at the tips of the gloves in order to provide visual aid. As the need for extravehicular activity grew, suits such as the Apollo A7L included gloves made of a metal fabric called Chromel-r in order to prevent punctures. In order to retain a better sense of touch for the astronauts, the fingertips of the gloves were made of silicone. With the shuttle program, it became necessary to be able to operate spacecraft modules, so the ACES suits featured gripping on the gloves. EMU gloves, which are used for spacewalks, are heated to keep the astronaut's hands warm. The Phase VI gloves, meant for use with the [Mark III suit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_III_(space_suit) "Mark III (space suit)"), are the first gloves to be designed with "laser scanning technology, 3D computer modeling, stereo lithography, laser cutting technology and CNC machining".[[NASA, ILC Dover Inc. 1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit#cite_note-10) This allows for cheaper, more accurate production, as well as increased detail in joint mobility and flexibility.

### Life support technology

Prior to the [Apollo missions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_program "Apollo program"), life support in space suits was connected to the space capsule via an [umbilical cable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cable "Umbilical cable"). However, with the Apollo missions, life support was configured into a removable capsule called the [Portable Life Support System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_Life_Support_System "Primary Life Support System") that allowed the astronaut to explore the Moon without having to be attached to the space craft. The EMU space suit, used for spacewalks, allows the astronaut to manually control the internal environment of the suit. The Mark III suit has a backpack containing about 12 pounds of liquid air for breathing, pressurization, and heat exchange.[_[clarification needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please\_clarify "Wikipedia:Please clarify")_][[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit#cite_note-nasa-9)

### Helmet technology

The development of the spheroidal dome helmet was key in balancing the need for field of view, pressure compensation, and low weight. One inconvenience with some space suits is the head being fixed facing forwards and being unable to turn to look sideways. Astronauts call this effect "alligator head".[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

### United States suit models

*   In the early 1950s, [Siegfried Hansen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siegfried_Hansen "Siegfried Hansen") and colleagues at [Litton Industries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litton_Industries "Litton Industries") designed and built a working hard-shell suit, which was used inside vacuum chambers and was the predecessor of space suits used in NASA missions.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit#cite_note-17)
*   [Navy Mark IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navy_Mark_IV "Navy Mark IV") high-altitude/vacuum suit– used for [Project Mercury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Mercury "Project Mercury") (1961–1963).
*   [Gemini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_space_suit "Gemini space suit") space suits (1965–1966)– there were three main variants developed: G3C designed for intra-vehicle use; G4C specially designed for EVA and intra-vehicle use; and a special [G5C spacesuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G5C_spacesuit "G5C spacesuit") worn by the [Gemini 7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_7 "Gemini 7") crew for 14 days inside the spacecraft.
*   [Manned Orbiting Laboratory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manned_Orbiting_Laboratory "Manned Orbiting Laboratory") MH-7 space suits for the canceled MOL program.
*   [Apollo Block I A1C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_space_suit#Apollo_program "Gemini space suit") suit (1966–1967)– a derivative of the Gemini suit, worn by primary and backup crews in training for two early Apollo missions. The nylon pressure garment melted and burned through in the [Apollo 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_1 "Apollo 1") cabin fire. This suit became obsolete when crewed Block I Apollo flights were discontinued after the fire.
*   [Apollo/Skylab A7L](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo/Skylab_A7L "Apollo/Skylab A7L") EVA and Moon suits– The Block II Apollo suit was the primary pressure suit worn for eleven Apollo flights, three Skylab flights, and the US astronauts on the [Apollo–Soyuz Test Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo%E2%80%93Soyuz_Test_Project "Apollo–Soyuz Test Project") between 1968 and 1975. The pressure garment's nylon outer layer was replaced with fireproof [Beta cloth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_cloth "Beta cloth") after the Apollo 1 fire. This suit was the first to employ a liquid-cooled inner garment and outer micrometeoroid garment. Beginning with the [Apollo 13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_13 "Apollo 13") mission, it also introduced "commander's stripes" so that a pair of space walkers will not appear identical on camera.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit#cite_note-18)
*   [Shuttle Ejection Escape Suit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuttle_Ejection_Escape_Suit "Shuttle Ejection Escape Suit")– used from [STS-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-1 "STS-1") (1981) to [STS-4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-4 "STS-4") (1982) by a two-man crew used in conjunction with the then-installed [ejection seats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejection_seat "Ejection seat"). Derived from a [USAF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force "United States Air Force") model.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit#cite_note-19) These were removed once the Shuttle became certified.
*   From [STS-5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-5 "STS-5") (1982) to [STS-51-L](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-51-L "STS-51-L") (1986) no pressure suits were worn during launch and reentry. The crew would wear only a blue-[flight suit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_suit "Flight suit") with an oxygen helmet.
*   [Launch Entry Suit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_Entry_Suit "Launch Entry Suit") first used on [STS-26](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-26 "STS-26") (1988), the first flight after the [_Challenger_ disaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Challenger_disaster "Space Shuttle Challenger disaster"). It was a partial pressure suit derived from a USAF model.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit#cite_note-20) It was used from 1988 to 1998.
*   [Advanced Crew Escape Suit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Crew_Escape_Suit "Advanced Crew Escape Suit") used on the Space Shuttle starting in 1994.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit#cite_note-21) The Advanced Crew Escape Suit or ACES suit, is a full-pressure suit worn by all Space Shuttle crews for the ascent and entry portions of flight. The suit is a direct descendant of the [United States Air Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force "United States Air Force") high-altitude pressure suits worn by SR-71 Blackbird and U-2 spy plane pilots, [North American X-15](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_X-15 "North American X-15") and [Gemini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Gemini "Project Gemini") pilot-astronauts, and the Launch Entry Suits worn by NASA astronauts starting on the STS-26 flight. It is derived from a USAF model.
*   [Extravehicular Mobility Unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_Mobility_Unit "Extravehicular Mobility Unit") (EMU)– used on both the Space Shuttle and [International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station "International Space Station") (ISS). The EMU is an independent anthropomorphic system that provides environmental protection, mobility, life support, and communications for a Space Shuttle or ISS crew member to perform an EVA in [Earth orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentric_orbit "Geocentric orbit"). Used from 1982 to present, but only available in limited sizing as of 2019.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit#cite_note-22)
*   Aerospace company [SpaceX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX "SpaceX") developed [an IVA suit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit#SpaceX_suit_(%22Starman_suit%22)) which is worn by astronauts involved in [Commercial Crew Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Program "Commercial Crew Program") missions operated by SpaceX since the [Demo-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crew_Dragon_Demo-2 "Crew Dragon Demo-2") mission. As a continuation of this suit design, SpaceX developed an EVA suit in 2024. The EVA version of the suit was used during the [Polaris Dawn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polaris_Dawn "Polaris Dawn") private space mission for the first ever commercial spacewalk.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit#cite_note-23)
*   Orion Crew Survival System (OCSS)– will be used during launch and re-entry on the [Orion MPCV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_(spacecraft) "Orion (spacecraft)"). It is derived from the Advanced Crew Escape Suit but is able to operate at a higher pressure and has improved mobility in the shoulders.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit#cite_note-24)

SpaceX suit

#### SpaceX suit ("Starman suit")

In February 2015, [SpaceX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX "SpaceX") began developing a space suit for astronauts to wear within the [Dragon 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon_2 "SpaceX Dragon 2") space capsule.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit#cite_note-sx20150227-25) Its appearance was jointly designed by Jose Fernandez—a Hollywood [costume designer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costume_designer "Costume designer") known for his works for [superhero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero_film "Superhero film") and [science fiction films](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction_film "Science fiction film")—and SpaceX founder and CEO [Elon Musk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk "Elon Musk").[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit#cite_note-26)[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit#cite_note-27) The first images of the suit were revealed in September 2017.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit#cite_note-28) A mannequin, called "Starman" (after [David Bowie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bowie "David Bowie")'s [song of the same name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starman_(song) "Starman (song)")), wore the SpaceX space suit during the [maiden launch of the Falcon Heavy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_Heavy_test_flight "Falcon Heavy test flight") in February 2018.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit#cite_note-29)[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit#cite_note-:2-30) For this exhibition launch, the suit was not pressurized and carried no sensors.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit#cite_note-31)

The suit, which is suitable for vacuum, offers protection against cabin depressurization through a single tether at the astronaut's thigh that feeds air and electronic connections. The helmets, which are 3D-printed, contain microphones and speakers. As the suits need the tether connection and do not offer protection against radiation, they are not used for extra-vehicular activities. The suits are custom-made for each astronaut.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit#cite_note-32)

In 2018, NASA commercial crew astronauts [Bob Behnken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Behnken "Bob Behnken"), and [Doug Hurley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Hurley "Doug Hurley") tested the spacesuit inside the Dragon 2 spacecraft in order to familiarize themselves with the suit.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit#cite_note-33) They wore it in the [Crew Dragon Demo-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crew_Dragon_Demo-2 "Crew Dragon Demo-2") flight launched on 30 May 2020.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit#cite_note-:2-30) The suit is worn by astronauts involved in [Commercial Crew Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Program "Commercial Crew Program") missions involving SpaceX.

On 4 May 2024, SpaceX unveiled a spacesuit designed for extravehicular activity based on the IVA suit for [Polaris Dawn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polaris_Dawn "Polaris Dawn") mission in [Polaris program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polaris_program "Polaris program"). As with the IVA suit, the helmets are [3D-printed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D-printed "3D-printed"), though the [EVA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_activity "Extravehicular activity") helmet incorporates a [heads-up display](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head-up_display "Head-up display") providing information and a [camera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera "Camera") on suit metrics during operation. It is more mobile, includes new [thermal insulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_insulation "Thermal insulation")[fabrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile "Textile"), and materials used [Falcon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon "Falcon")’s [interstage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstage "Interstage") and [Crew Dragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crew_Dragon "Crew Dragon")’s external unpressurized trunk.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit#cite_note-34)

#### Future NASA contracted suits

On 1 June 2022, NASA announced it had selected competing [Axiom Space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_Space "Axiom Space") and [Collins Aerospace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collins_Aerospace "Collins Aerospace") to develop and provide astronauts with next generation spacesuit and spacewalk systems to first test and later use outside the International Space Station, as well as on the lunar surface for the crewed [Artemis missions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis_program "Artemis program"), and prepare for human missions to Mars.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit#cite_note-35)[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit#cite_note-SpaceNews_2022-36)[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit#cite_note-:3-37)

### Chinese suit models

*   [Shuguang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuguang_(spacecraft) "Shuguang (spacecraft)") (曙光, meaning "Dawn") space suit: First generation EVA space suit developed by China for the 1967 canceled _[Project 714](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuguang\_(spacecraft) "Shuguang (spacecraft)")_ crewed space program. It has a mass of about 10 kilograms (20 lb), has an orange colour, and is made of high-resistance multi-layer polyester fabric.

![Image 34](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Ambox_current_red.svg/60px-Ambox_current_red.svg.png)This section's **[factual accuracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Accuracy_dispute "Wikipedia:Accuracy dispute") may be compromised due to out-of-date information**. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information._(April 2017)_

Several companies and universities are developing technologies and prototypes which represent improvements over current space suits.

### Additive manufacturing

[3D printing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_printing "3D printing") (additive manufacturing) can be used to reduce the mass of hard-shell space suits while retaining the high mobility they provide. This fabrication method also allows for the potential for in-suit fabrication and repair of suits, a capability which is not currently available, but will likely be necessary for Martian exploration.[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit#cite_note-48) The [University of Maryland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Maryland,_College_Park "University of Maryland, College Park") began development of a prototype 3D printed hard suit in 2016, based on the kinematics of the [AX-5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powered_exoskeleton#NASA_AX-5_hard_shell_space_suit "Powered exoskeleton"). The prototype arm segment is designed to be evaluated in the [Space Systems Laboratory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Systems_Laboratory_(Maryland) "Space Systems Laboratory (Maryland)") glovebox to compare mobility to traditional soft suits. Initial research has focused on the feasibility of printing rigid suit elements, bearing races, ball bearings, seals, and sealing surfaces.[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit#cite_note-49)

### Astronaut Glove Challenge

There are certain difficulties in designing a dexterous space suit glove and there are limitations to the current designs. For this reason, the [Centennial Astronaut Glove Challenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centennial_Challenges#Astronaut_glove_challenge "Centennial Challenges") was created to build a better glove. Competitions have been held in 2007 and 2009, and another is planned. The 2009 contest required the glove to be covered with a micro-meteorite layer.

### Aouda.X

[![Image 35](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Aouda.X_space_suit_simulator.jpg/250px-Aouda.X_space_suit_simulator.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Aouda.X_space_suit_simulator.jpg)

Aouda.X

Since 2009, the [Austrian Space Forum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_Space_Forum "Austrian Space Forum") has been developing "Aouda.X", an experimental Mars [analogue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_analog_missions "Human analog missions") space suit focusing on an advanced [human–machine interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93machine_interface "Human–machine interface") and on-board computing network to increase [situational awareness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation_awareness "Situation awareness"). The suit is designed to study contamination vectors in planetary exploration analogue environments and create limitations depending on the pressure regime chosen for a simulation.

Since 2012, for the Mars2013 analogue mission by the Austrian Space Forum to [Erfoud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erfoud "Erfoud"), [Morocco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco "Morocco"), the Aouda.X analogue space suit has a sister in the form of Aouda.S.[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit#cite_note-50) This is a slightly less sophisticated suit meant primarily to assist Aouda.X operations and be able to study the interactions between two (analogue) astronauts in similar suits.

The Aouda.X and Aouda.S space suits have been named after the [fictional princess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aouda "Aouda") from the [Jules Verne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_Verne "Jules Verne")'s 1873 novel _[Around the World in Eighty Days](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Around\_the\_World\_in\_Eighty\_Days "Around the World in Eighty Days")_. A public display mock-up of Aouda.X (called Aouda.D) is currently on display at the Dachstein Ice Cave in [Obertraun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obertraun "Obertraun"), [Austria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria "Austria"), after the experiments done there in 2012.[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit#cite_note-51)

### Axiom Space and Prada

In 2024, at the [International Astronautical Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Astronautical_Congress "International Astronautical Congress") in Milan, Italy, Axiom Space and Prada showed the results of an ongoing collaboration to develop a spacesuit for NASA's Artemis III mission.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit#cite_note-:3-37)

### Bio-Suit

[Bio-Suit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bio-Suit "Bio-Suit") is a [space activity suit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_activity_suit "Space activity suit") under development at the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"), which as of 2006 consisted of several lower leg prototypes. Bio-suit is custom fit to each wearer, using laser body scanning.[_[needs update](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual\_of\_Style/Dates\_and\_numbers#Chronological\_items "Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers")_]

### Constellation Space Suit system

On August 2, 2006, NASA indicated plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the design, development, certification, production, and sustaining engineering of the [Constellation Space Suit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation_Space_Suit "Constellation Space Suit") to meet the needs of the [Constellation Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation_program "Constellation program").[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit#cite_note-52) NASA foresaw a single suit capable of supporting: survivability during launch, entry and abort; [zero-gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weightlessness "Weightlessness") EVA; lunar surface EVA; and Mars surface EVA.

On June 11, 2008, NASA awarded a US$745 million contract to [Oceaneering International](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceaneering_International "Oceaneering International") to create the new space suit.[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit#cite_note-53)

### Final Frontier Design IVA Space Suit

[![Image 36](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/FFD_IVA_Space_Suit.jpg/250px-FFD_IVA_Space_Suit.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:FFD_IVA_Space_Suit.jpg)

Final Frontier Design IVA Space Suit

[Final Frontier Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Frontier_Design "Final Frontier Design") (FFD) is developing a commercial full IVA space suit, with their first suit completed in 2010.[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit#cite_note-54) FFD's suits are intended as a light-weight, highly mobile, and inexpensive commercial space suits. Since 2011, FFD has upgraded IVA suit's designs, hardware, processes, and capabilities. FFD has built a total of 7 IVA space suit (2016) assemblies for various institutions and customers since founding, and has conducted high fidelity human testing in simulators, aircraft, microgravity, and hypobaric chambers. FFD has a Space Act Agreement with NASA's Commercial Space Capabilities Office to develop and execute a Human Rating Plan for FFD IVA suit.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit#cite_note-55) FFD categorizes their IVA suits according to their mission: Terra for Earth-based testing, Stratos for high altitude flights, and Exos for orbital space flights. Each suit category has different requirements for manufacturing controls, validations, and materials, but are of a similar architecture.

### I-Suit

The [I-Suit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I-Suit "I-Suit") is a space suit prototype also constructed by ILC Dover, which incorporates several design improvements over the EMU, including a weight-saving soft upper torso. Both the Mark III and the I-Suit have taken part in NASA's annual [Desert Research and Technology Studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert_Research_and_Technology_Studies "Desert Research and Technology Studies") (D-RATS) field trials, during which suit occupants interact with one another, and with rovers and other equipment.

### Mark III

The [Mark III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_III_(space_suit) "Mark III (space suit)") is a NASA prototype, constructed by ILC Dover, which incorporates a hard lower torso section and a mix of soft and hard components. The Mark III is markedly more mobile than previous suits, despite its high operating pressure (57 kPa or 8.3 psi), which makes it a "zero-prebreathe" suit, meaning that astronauts would be able to transition directly from a one-atmosphere, mixed-gas space station environment, such as that on the International Space Station, to the suit, without risking decompression sickness, which can occur with rapid depressurization from an atmosphere containing nitrogen or another inert gas.

### MX-2

The MX-2 is a space suit analogue constructed at the [University of Maryland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Maryland,_College_Park "University of Maryland, College Park")'s Space Systems Laboratory. The MX-2 is used[_[when?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual\_of\_Style/Dates\_and\_numbers#Chronological\_items "Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers")_] for crewed [neutral buoyancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutral_buoyancy "Neutral buoyancy") testing at the Space Systems Lab's Neutral Buoyancy Research Facility. By approximating the work envelope of a real EVA suit, without meeting the requirements of a flight-rated suit, the MX-2 provides an inexpensive platform for EVA research, compared to using EMU suits at facilities like NASA's [Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutral_Buoyancy_Laboratory "Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory").

The MX-2 has an operating pressure of 2.5–4 psi. It is a rear-entry suit, featuring a fiberglass [HUT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_Upper_Torso "Hard Upper Torso"). Air, LCVG cooling water, and power are open loop systems, provided through an [umbilical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cable "Umbilical cable"). The suit contains a [Mac Mini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_Mini "Mac Mini")[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] computer to capture sensor data, such as suit pressure, inlet and outlet air temperatures, and heart rate.[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit#cite_note-56) Resizable suit elements and adjustable ballast allow the suit to accommodate subjects ranging in height from 68 to 75 inches (170–190 cm), and with a weight range of 120 lb (54 kg).[_[clarification needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please\_clarify "Wikipedia:Please clarify")_][[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit#cite_note-57)

### North Dakota suit

Beginning in May 2006, five [North Dakota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Dakota "North Dakota") colleges collaborated on a new space suit prototype, funded by a US$100,000 grant from NASA, to demonstrate technologies which could be incorporated into a planetary suit. The suit was tested in the [Theodore Roosevelt National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt_National_Park "Theodore Roosevelt National Park")[badlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badlands "Badlands") of western North Dakota. The suit has a mass of 47 pounds (21 kg) without a life support backpack, and costs only a fraction of the standard US$12,000,000 cost for a flight-rated NASA space suit.[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit#cite_note-58) The suit was developed in just over a year by students from the [University of North Dakota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_North_Dakota "University of North Dakota"), [North Dakota State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Dakota_State_University "North Dakota State University"), [Dickinson State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dickinson_State_University "Dickinson State University"), the state [College of Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Dakota_State_College_of_Science "North Dakota State College of Science") and [Turtle Mountain Community College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_Mountain_Community_College "Turtle Mountain Community College").[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit#cite_note-59) The mobility of the North Dakota suit can be attributed to its low operating pressure; while the North Dakota suit was field tested at a pressure of 1 psi (6.9 kPa; 52 Torr) differential, NASA's EMU suit operates at a pressure of 4.7 psi (32 kPa; 240 Torr), a pressure designed to supply approximately sea-level oxygen partial pressure for [respiration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system "Respiratory system") (see discussion [above](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit#Operating_pressure)).

### PXS

NASA's Prototype eXploration Suit (PXS), like the Z-series, is a rear-entry suit compatible with suitports.[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit#cite_note-:0-60) The suit has components which could be 3D printed during missions to a range of specifications, to fit different individuals or changing mobility requirements.[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit#cite_note-:1-61)

### Suitports

A [suitport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suitport "Suitport") is a theoretical alternative to an [airlock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airlock "Airlock"), designed for use in hazardous environments and in [human spaceflight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight "Human spaceflight"), especially [planetary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet "Planet") surface exploration. In a suitport system, a rear-entry space suit is attached and sealed against the outside of a spacecraft, such that an astronaut can enter and seal up the suit, then go on EVA, without the need for an airlock or depressurizing the spacecraft cabin. Suitports require less mass and volume than airlocks, provide [dust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust "Dust") mitigation, and prevent cross-contamination of the inside and outside environments. Patents for suitport designs were filed in 1996 by Philip Culbertson Jr. of NASA's Ames Research Center and in 2003 by Joerg Boettcher, Stephen Ransom, and Frank Steinsiek.[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit#cite_note-culbertson-62)[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit#cite_note-63)

### Z-series

[![Image 37](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Z-1_Spacesuit_Prototype_-_standing_Nov_2012.jpg/250px-Z-1_Spacesuit_Prototype_-_standing_Nov_2012.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Z-1_Spacesuit_Prototype_-_standing_Nov_2012.jpg)

Z-1 Series Suit

In 2012, NASA introduced the Z-1 space suit, the first in the Z-series of space suit prototypes designed by NASA specifically for planetary extravehicular activity. The Z-1 space suit includes an emphasis on mobility and protection for space missions. It features a soft torso versus the hard torsos seen in previous NASA EVA space suits, which reduces mass.[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit#cite_note-64) It has been labeled the "Buzz Lightyear suit" due to its green streaks for a design.

In 2014, NASA released the design for the Z-2 prototype, the next model in the Z-series. NASA conducted a poll asking the public to decide on a design for the Z-2 space suit. The designs, created by fashion students from Philadelphia University, were "Technology", "Trends in Society", and "Biomimicry".[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit#cite_note-65) The design "Technology" won, and the prototype is built with technologies like [3D printing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_printing "3D printing"). The Z-2 suit will also differ from the Z-1 suit in that the torso reverts to the hard shell, as seen in NASA's EMU suit.[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit#cite_note-66)[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit#cite_note-67)
