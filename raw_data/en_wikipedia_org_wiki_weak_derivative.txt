( May 2014 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) In mathematics , a weak derivative is a generalization of the concept of the derivative of a function ( strong derivative ) for functions not assumed differentiable , but only integrable , i.e., to lie in the L p space L 1 ( [ a , b ] ) {\displaystyle L^{1}([a,b])} .

The method of integration by parts holds that for smooth functions u {\displaystyle u} and φ φ {\displaystyle \varphi } we have ∫ ∫ a b u ( x ) φ φ ′ ( x ) d x = [ u ( x ) φ φ ( x ) ] a b − − ∫ ∫ a b u ′ ( x ) φ φ ( x ) d x .

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\int _{a}^{b}u(x)\varphi '(x)\,dx&={\Big [}u(x)\varphi (x){\Big ]}_{a}^{b}-\int _{a}^{b}u'(x)\varphi (x)\,dx.\\[6pt]\end{aligned}}} A function u ' being the weak derivative of u is essentially defined by the requirement that this equation must hold for all smooth functions φ φ {\displaystyle \varphi } vanishing at the boundary points ( φ φ ( a ) = φ φ ( b ) = 0 {\displaystyle \varphi (a)=\varphi (b)=0} ).

Definition [ edit ] Let u {\displaystyle u} be a function in the Lebesgue space L 1 ( [ a , b ] ) {\displaystyle L^{1}([a,b])} . We say that v {\displaystyle v} in L 1 ( [ a , b ] ) {\displaystyle L^{1}([a,b])} is a weak derivative of u {\displaystyle u} if ∫ ∫ a b u ( t ) φ φ ′ ( t ) d t = − − ∫ ∫ a b v ( t ) φ φ ( t ) d t {\displaystyle \int _{a}^{b}u(t)\varphi '(t)\,dt=-\int _{a}^{b}v(t)\varphi (t)\,dt} for all infinitely differentiable functions φ φ {\displaystyle \varphi } with φ φ ( a ) = φ φ ( b ) = 0 {\displaystyle \varphi (a)=\varphi (b)=0} .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Generalizing to n {\displaystyle n} dimensions, if u {\displaystyle u} and v {\displaystyle v} are in the space L loc 1 ( U ) {\displaystyle L_{\text{loc}}^{1}(U)} of locally integrable functions for some open set U ⊂ ⊂ R n {\displaystyle U\subset \mathbb {R} ^{n}} , and if α α {\displaystyle \alpha } is a multi-index , we say that v {\displaystyle v} is the α α th {\displaystyle \alpha ^{\text{th}}} -weak derivative of u {\displaystyle u} if ∫ ∫ U u D α α φ φ = ( − − 1 ) | α α | ∫ ∫ U v φ φ , {\displaystyle \int _{U}uD^{\alpha }\varphi =(-1)^{|\alpha |}\int _{U}v\varphi ,} for all φ φ ∈ ∈ C c ∞ ∞ ( U ) {\displaystyle \varphi \in C_{c}^{\infty }(U)} , that is, for all infinitely differentiable functions φ φ {\displaystyle \varphi } with compact support in U {\displaystyle U} . Here D α α φ φ {\displaystyle D^{\alpha }\varphi } is defined as D α α φ φ = ∂ ∂ | α α | φ φ ∂ ∂ x 1 α α 1 ⋯ ⋯ ∂ ∂ x n α α n .

{\displaystyle D^{\alpha }\varphi ={\frac {\partial ^{|\alpha |}\varphi }{\partial x_{1}^{\alpha _{1}}\cdots \partial x_{n}^{\alpha _{n}}}}.} If u {\displaystyle u} has a weak derivative, it is often written D α α u {\displaystyle D^{\alpha }u} since weak derivatives are unique (at least, up to a set of measure zero , see below).

[ 3 ] Examples [ edit ] The absolute value function u : R → → R + , u ( t ) = | t | {\displaystyle u:\mathbb {R} \rightarrow \mathbb {R} _{+},u(t)=|t|} , which is not differentiable at t = 0 {\displaystyle t=0} has a weak derivative v : R → → R {\displaystyle v:\mathbb {R} \rightarrow \mathbb {R} } known as the sign function , and given by v ( t ) = { 1 if t > 0 ; 0 if t = 0 ; − − 1 if t < 0.

{\displaystyle v(t)={\begin{cases}1&{\text{if }}t>0;\\[6pt]0&{\text{if }}t=0;\\[6pt]-1&{\text{if }}t<0.\end{cases}}} This is not the only weak derivative for u : any w that is equal to v almost everywhere is also a weak derivative for u . For example, the definition of v (0) above could be replaced with any desired real number. Usually, the existence of multiple solutions is not a problem, since functions are considered to be equivalent in the theory of L p spaces and Sobolev spaces if they are equal almost everywhere.

The characteristic function of the rational numbers 1 Q {\displaystyle 1_{\mathbb {Q} }} is nowhere differentiable yet has a weak derivative.  Since the Lebesgue measure of the rational numbers is zero, ∫ ∫ 1 Q ( t ) φ φ ( t ) d t = 0.

{\displaystyle \int 1_{\mathbb {Q} }(t)\varphi (t)\,dt=0.} Thus v ( t ) = 0 {\displaystyle v(t)=0} is a weak derivative of 1 Q {\displaystyle 1_{\mathbb {Q} }} .  Note that this does agree with our intuition since when considered as a member of an L p space, 1 Q {\displaystyle 1_{\mathbb {Q} }} is identified with the zero function.

The Cantor function c does not have a weak derivative, despite being differentiable almost everywhere. This is because any weak derivative of c would have to be equal almost everywhere to the classical derivative of c , which is zero almost everywhere. But the zero function is not a weak derivative of c , as can be seen by comparing against an appropriate test function φ φ {\displaystyle \varphi } . More theoretically, c does not have a weak derivative because its distributional derivative , namely the Cantor distribution , is a singular measure and therefore cannot be represented by a function.

Properties [ edit ] If two functions are weak derivatives of the same function, they are equal except on a set with Lebesgue measure zero, i.e., they are equal almost everywhere .  If we consider equivalence classes of functions such that two functions are equivalent if they are equal almost everywhere, then the weak derivative is unique.

Also, if u is differentiable in the conventional sense then its weak derivative is identical (in the sense given above) to its conventional (strong) derivative.  Thus the weak derivative is a generalization of the strong one.  Furthermore, the classical rules for derivatives of sums and products of functions also hold for the weak derivative.

Extensions [ edit ] This concept gives rise to the definition of weak solutions in Sobolev spaces , which are useful for problems of differential equations and in functional analysis .
