( December 2023 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Sun's faculae. Dark regions are sunspots and the brighter speckled regions around them are faculae.

Solar faculae are bright spots in the photosphere that form in the canyons between solar granules , short-lived convection cells several thousand kilometers across that constantly form and dissipate over timescales of several minutes.

Faculae are produced by concentrations of magnetic field lines . Strong concentrations of faculae appear during increased solar activity , with or without sunspots . Faculae and sunspots contribute noticeably to variations in the solar constant .
The chromospheric counterpart of a facular region is called a plage .
