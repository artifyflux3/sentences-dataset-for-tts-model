 Per the compactness criteria for Euclidean space as stated in the [Heine–Borel theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heine%E2%80%93Borel_theorem "Heine–Borel theorem"), the interval _A_ = (−∞, −2] is not compact because it is not bounded. The interval _C_ = (2, 4) is not compact because it is not closed (but bounded). The interval _B_ = [0, 1] is compact because it is both closed and bounded.

In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), specifically [general topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_topology "General topology"), **compactness** is a property that seeks to generalize the notion of a [closed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_set "Closed set") and [bounded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounded_set "Bounded set") subset of [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space#cite_note-1) The idea is that a compact space has no "punctures" or "missing endpoints", i.e., it includes all [_limiting values_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_(mathematics) "Limit (mathematics)") of points. For example, the open [interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics) "Interval (mathematics)") (0,1) would not be compact because it excludes the limiting values of 0 and 1, whereas the closed interval [0,1] would be compact. Similarly, the space of [rational numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_number "Rational number")![Image 2: {\displaystyle \mathbb {Q} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c5909f0b54e4718fa24d5fd34d54189d24a66e9a) is not compact, because it has infinitely many "punctures" corresponding to the [irrational numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrational_number "Irrational number"), and the space of [real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number")![Image 3: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/786849c765da7a84dbc3cce43e96aad58a5868dc) is not compact either, because it excludes the two limiting values ![Image 4: {\displaystyle +\infty }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bddbb0e4420a7e744cf71bd71216e11b0bf88831) and ![Image 5: {\displaystyle -\infty }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ca2608c4b5fd3bffc73585f8c67e379b4e99b6f1). However, the [_extended_ real number line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_real_numbers "Extended real numbers")_would_ be compact, since it contains both infinities. There are many ways to make this heuristic notion precise. These ways usually agree in a [metric space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_space "Metric space"), but may not be [equivalent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_equivalence "Logical equivalence") in other [topological spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space "Topological space").

One such generalization is that a topological space is [_sequentially_ compact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequentially_compact "Sequentially compact") if every [infinite sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_sequence "Infinite sequence") of points sampled from the space has an infinite [subsequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsequence "Subsequence") that converges to some point of the space.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space#cite_note-2) The [Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolzano%E2%80%93Weierstrass_theorem "Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem") states that a subset of Euclidean space is compact in this sequential sense if and only if it is closed and bounded. Thus, if one chooses an infinite number of points in the closed [unit interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_interval "Unit interval")[0, 1], some of those points will get arbitrarily close to some real number in that space. For instance, some of the numbers in the sequence ⁠1/2⁠, ⁠4/5⁠, ⁠1/3⁠, ⁠5/6⁠, ⁠1/4⁠, ⁠6/7⁠, ... accumulate to 0 (while others accumulate to 1). Since neither 0 nor 1 are members of the open unit interval (0, 1), those same sets of points would not accumulate to any point of it, so the open unit interval is not compact. Although subsets (subspaces) of Euclidean space can be compact, the entire space itself is not compact, since it is not bounded. For example, considering ![Image 6: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{1}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ec2e282911e406fc800fb1095093667d66f18c7f) (the real number line), the sequence of points  0, 1, 2, 3, ... has no subsequence that converges to any real number.

Compactness was formally introduced by [Maurice Fréchet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Fr%C3%A9chet "Maurice Fréchet") in 1906 to generalize the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem from spaces of geometrical points to [spaces of functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_space "Function space"). The [Arzelà–Ascoli theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arzel%C3%A0%E2%80%93Ascoli_theorem "Arzelà–Ascoli theorem") and the [Peano existence theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_existence_theorem "Peano existence theorem") exemplify applications of this notion of compactness to classical analysis. Following its initial introduction, various equivalent notions of compactness, including [sequential compactness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequentially_compact_space "Sequentially compact space") and [limit point compactness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_point_compact "Limit point compact"), were developed in general [metric spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_space "Metric space").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space#cite_note-:0-3) In general topological spaces, however, these notions of compactness are not necessarily equivalent. The most useful notion—and the standard definition of the unqualified term _compactness_—is phrased in terms of the existence of finite families of [open sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_set "Open set") that "[cover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_(topology) "Cover (topology)")" the space, in the sense that each point of the space lies in some set contained in the family. This more subtle notion, introduced by [Pavel Alexandrov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavel_Alexandrov "Pavel Alexandrov") and [Pavel Urysohn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavel_Urysohn "Pavel Urysohn") in 1929, exhibits compact spaces as generalizations of [finite sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_set "Finite set"). In spaces that are compact in this sense, it is often possible to patch together information that holds [locally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_property "Local property")—that is, in a neighborhood of each point—into corresponding statements that hold throughout the space, and many theorems are of this character.

The term **compact set** is sometimes used as a synonym for compact space, but also often refers to a [compact subspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space#Compactness_of_subsets) of a [topological space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space "Topological space").

Historical development
----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Compact_space&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Historical development")]

In the 19th century, several disparate mathematical properties were understood that would later be seen as consequences of compactness. On the one hand, [Bernard Bolzano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Bolzano "Bernard Bolzano") ([1817](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space#CITEREFBolzano1817)) had been aware that any bounded sequence of points (in the line or plane, for instance) has a subsequence that must eventually get arbitrarily close to some other point, called a [limit point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_point_of_a_sequence "Limit point of a sequence"). Bolzano's proof relied on the [method of bisection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_bisection "Method of bisection"): the sequence was placed into an interval that was then divided into two equal parts, and a part containing infinitely many terms of the sequence was selected. The process could then be repeated by dividing the resulting smaller interval into smaller and smaller parts—until it closes down on the desired limit point. The full significance of [Bolzano's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolzano%E2%80%93Weierstrass_theorem "Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem"), and its method of proof, would not emerge until almost 50 years later when it was rediscovered by [Karl Weierstrass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Weierstrass "Karl Weierstrass").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space#cite_note-4)

In the 1880s, it became clear that results similar to the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem could be formulated for [spaces of functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_space "Function space") rather than just numbers or geometrical points. The idea of regarding functions as themselves points of a generalized space dates back to the investigations of [Giulio Ascoli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giulio_Ascoli "Giulio Ascoli") and [Cesare Arzelà](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cesare_Arzel%C3%A0 "Cesare Arzelà").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space#cite_note-5) The culmination of their investigations, the [Arzelà–Ascoli theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arzel%C3%A0%E2%80%93Ascoli_theorem "Arzelà–Ascoli theorem"), was a generalization of the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem to families of [continuous functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function "Continuous function"), the precise conclusion of which was that it was possible to extract a [uniformly convergent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_convergence "Uniform convergence") sequence of functions from a suitable family of functions. The uniform limit of this sequence then played precisely the same role as Bolzano's "limit point". Towards the beginning of the twentieth century, results similar to that of Arzelà and Ascoli began to accumulate in the area of [integral equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_equation "Integral equation"), as investigated by [David Hilbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hilbert "David Hilbert") and [Erhard Schmidt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erhard_Schmidt "Erhard Schmidt"). For a certain class of [Green's functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green%27s_functions "Green's functions") coming from solutions of integral equations, Schmidt had shown that a property analogous to the Arzelà–Ascoli theorem held in the sense of [mean convergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_convergence "Mean convergence") – or convergence in what would later be dubbed a [Hilbert space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_space "Hilbert space"). This ultimately led to the notion of a [compact operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_operator "Compact operator") as an offshoot of the general notion of a compact space. It was [Maurice Fréchet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Ren%C3%A9_Fr%C3%A9chet "Maurice René Fréchet") who, in [1906](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space#CITEREFFr%C3%A9chet1906), had distilled the essence of the Bolzano–Weierstrass property and coined the term _compactness_ to refer to this general phenomenon (he used the term already in his 1904 paper[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space#cite_note-6) which led to the famous 1906 thesis).

However, a different notion of compactness altogether had also slowly emerged at the end of the 19th century from the study of the [continuum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_continuum "Linear continuum"), which was seen as fundamental for the rigorous formulation of analysis. In 1870, [Eduard Heine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduard_Heine "Eduard Heine") showed that a [continuous function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function "Continuous function") defined on a closed and bounded interval was in fact [uniformly continuous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniformly_continuous "Uniformly continuous"). In the course of the proof, he made use of a lemma that from any countable cover of the interval by smaller open intervals, it was possible to select a finite number of these that also covered it. The significance of this lemma was recognized by [Émile Borel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89mile_Borel "Émile Borel") ([1895](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space#CITEREFBorel1895)), and it was generalized to arbitrary collections of intervals by [Pierre Cousin](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pierre_Cousin_(mathematician)&action=edit&redlink=1 "Pierre Cousin (mathematician) (page does not exist)") (1895) and [Henri Lebesgue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Lebesgue "Henri Lebesgue") ([1904](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space#CITEREFLebesgue1904)). The [Heine–Borel theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heine%E2%80%93Borel_theorem "Heine–Borel theorem"), as the result is now known, is another special property possessed by closed and bounded sets of real numbers.

This property was significant because it allowed for the passage from [local information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_property "Local property") about a set (such as the continuity of a function) to global information about the set (such as the uniform continuity of a function). This sentiment was expressed by [Lebesgue (1904)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space#CITEREFLebesgue1904), who also exploited it in the development of the [integral now bearing his name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebesgue_integral "Lebesgue integral"). Ultimately, the Russian school of [point-set topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-set_topology "Point-set topology"), under the direction of [Pavel Alexandrov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavel_Alexandrov "Pavel Alexandrov") and [Pavel Urysohn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavel_Urysohn "Pavel Urysohn"), formulated Heine–Borel compactness in a way that could be applied to the modern notion of a [topological space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space "Topological space"). [Alexandrov & Urysohn (1929)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space#CITEREFAlexandrovUrysohn1929) showed that the earlier version of compactness due to Fréchet, now called (relative) [sequential compactness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequential_compactness "Sequential compactness"), under appropriate conditions followed from the version of compactness that was formulated in terms of the existence of finite subcovers. It was this notion of compactness that became the dominant one, because it was not only a stronger property, but it could be formulated in a more general setting with a minimum of additional technical machinery, as it relied only on the structure of the open sets in a space.

Any [finite space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_topological_space "Finite topological space") is compact; a finite subcover can be obtained by selecting, for each point, an open set containing it. A nontrivial example of a compact space is the (closed) [unit interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_interval "Unit interval")[0,1] of [real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number"). If one chooses an infinite number of distinct points in the unit interval, then there must be some [accumulation point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accumulation_point "Accumulation point") among these points in that interval. For instance, the odd-numbered terms of the sequence 1, ⁠1/2⁠, ⁠1/3⁠, ⁠3/4⁠, ⁠1/5⁠, ⁠5/6⁠, ⁠1/7⁠, ⁠7/8⁠, ... get arbitrarily close to 0, while the even-numbered ones get arbitrarily close to 1. The given example sequence shows the importance of including the [boundary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(topology) "Boundary (topology)") points of the interval, since the [limit points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_of_a_sequence "Limit of a sequence") must be in the space itself—an open (or half-open) interval of the real numbers is not compact. It is also crucial that the interval be [bounded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounded_set "Bounded set"), since in the interval [0,∞), one could choose the sequence of points 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., of which no sub-sequence ultimately gets arbitrarily close to any given real number.

In two dimensions, closed [disks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_(mathematics) "Disk (mathematics)") are compact since for any infinite number of points sampled from a disk, some subset of those points must get arbitrarily close either to a point within the disc, or to a point on the boundary. However, an open disk is not compact, because a sequence of points can tend to the boundary—without getting arbitrarily close to any point in the interior. Likewise, spheres are compact, but a sphere missing a point is not since a sequence of points can still tend to the missing point, thereby not getting arbitrarily close to any point _within_ the space. Lines and planes are not compact, since one can take a set of equally-spaced points in any given direction without approaching any point.

Various definitions of compactness may apply, depending on the level of generality. A subset of [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space") in particular is called compact if it is [closed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_set "Closed set") and [bounded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounded_set "Bounded set"). This implies, by the [Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolzano%E2%80%93Weierstrass_theorem "Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem"), that any infinite [sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_(mathematics) "Sequence (mathematics)") from the set has a [subsequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsequence "Subsequence") that converges to a point in the set. Various equivalent notions of compactness, such as [sequential compactness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequential_compactness "Sequential compactness") and [limit point compactness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_point_compact "Limit point compact"), can be developed in general [metric spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_space "Metric space").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space#cite_note-:0-3)

In contrast, the different notions of compactness are not equivalent in general [topological spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space "Topological space"), and the most useful notion of compactness—originally called _bicompactness_—is defined using [covers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_(topology) "Cover (topology)") consisting of [open sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_set "Open set") (see _Open cover definition_ below). That this form of compactness holds for closed and bounded subsets of Euclidean space is known as the [Heine–Borel theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heine%E2%80%93Borel_theorem "Heine–Borel theorem"). Compactness, when defined in this manner, often allows one to take information that is known [locally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_property "Local property")—in a [neighbourhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighbourhood_(mathematics) "Neighbourhood (mathematics)") of each point of the space—and to extend it to information that holds globally throughout the space. An example of this phenomenon is Dirichlet's theorem, to which it was originally applied by Heine, that a continuous function on a compact interval is [uniformly continuous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniformly_continuous "Uniformly continuous"); here, continuity is a local property of the function, and uniform continuity the corresponding global property.

### Open cover definition

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Compact_space&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Open cover definition")]

Formally, a [topological space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space "Topological space")X is called _compact_ if every [open cover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_cover "Open cover") of X has a [finite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_set "Finite set")[subcover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcover "Subcover").[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space#cite_note-7) That is, X is compact if for every collection C of open subsets[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space#cite_note-8) of X such that

![Image 7: {\displaystyle X=\bigcup _{S\in C}S\ ,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d92107fc5d99ad6da70aa8e3a3b7c1ef8aab0028)

there is a **finite** subcollection F ⊆ C such that

![Image 8: {\displaystyle X=\bigcup _{S\in F}S\ .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7c5a64504a64f698540213012db7709a3d039395)

Some branches of mathematics such as [algebraic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry "Algebraic geometry"), typically influenced by the French school of [Bourbaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Bourbaki "Nicolas Bourbaki"), use the term _quasi-compact_ for the general notion, and reserve the term _compact_ for topological spaces that are both [Hausdorff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_space "Hausdorff space") and _quasi-compact_. A compact set is sometimes referred to as a _compactum_, plural _compacta_.

### Compactness of subsets

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Compact_space&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Compactness of subsets")]

A subset K of a topological space X is said to be compact if it is compact as a subspace (in the [subspace topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspace_topology "Subspace topology")). That is, K is compact if for every arbitrary collection C of open subsets of X such that

![Image 9: {\displaystyle K\subseteq \bigcup _{S\in C}S\ ,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0dbf680eb4ef91af13172505c35018e965bba8cd)

there is a **finite** subcollection F ⊆ C such that

![Image 10: {\displaystyle K\subseteq \bigcup _{S\in F}S\ .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/87f0482b85a60713832bcfe43e178ad8415198d0)

Because compactness is a [topological property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_property "Topological property"), the compactness of a subset depends only on the subspace topology induced on it. It follows that, if ![Image 11: {\displaystyle K\subset Z\subset Y}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ba6330afdad305c81ed6b60f7db5b062f20044e9), with subset Z equipped with the subspace topology, then K is compact in Z if and only if K is compact in Y.

If X is a topological space then the following are equivalent:

1.   X is compact; i.e., every [open cover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_cover "Open cover") of X has a finite [subcover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcover "Subcover").
2.   X has a sub-base such that every cover of the space, by members of the sub-base, has a finite subcover ([Alexander's sub-base theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander%27s_sub-base_theorem "Alexander's sub-base theorem")).
3.   X is [Lindelöf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindel%C3%B6f_space "Lindelöf space") and [countably compact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countably_compact "Countably compact").[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHowes1995xxvi%E2%80%93xxviii-9)
4.   Any collection of closed subsets of X with the [finite intersection property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_intersection_property "Finite intersection property") has nonempty intersection.
5.   Every [net](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_(mathematics) "Net (mathematics)") on X has a convergent subnet (see the article on [nets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_(mathematics) "Net (mathematics)") for a proof).
6.   Every [filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filters_in_topology "Filters in topology") on X has a convergent refinement.
7.   Every net on X has a cluster point.
8.   Every filter on X has a cluster point.
9.   Every [ultrafilter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrafilter_(set_theory) "Ultrafilter (set theory)") on X converges to at least one point.
10.   Every infinite subset of X has a [complete accumulation point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_accumulation_point "Complete accumulation point").[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space#cite_note-10)
11.   For every topological space Y, the projection ![Image 12: {\displaystyle X\times Y\to Y}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/66e9d4154e92a7e0f561725fe46b479499743d82) is a [closed mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_mapping "Closed mapping")[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space#cite_note-Bourbaki-11) (see [proper map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_map "Proper map")).
12.   Every open cover linearly ordered by subset inclusion contains X.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMack1967-12)

Bourbaki defines a compact space (quasi-compact space) as a topological space where each filter has a cluster point (i.e., 8. in the above).[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space#cite_note-BourbakiDefinition-13)

For any [subset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset "Subset")A of [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space"), A is compact if and only if it is [closed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_set "Closed set") and [bounded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounded_set "Bounded set"); this is the [Heine–Borel theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heine%E2%80%93Borel_theorem "Heine–Borel theorem").

As a [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space") is a metric space, the conditions in the next subsection also apply to all of its subsets. Of all of the equivalent conditions, it is in practice easiest to verify that a subset is closed and bounded, for example, for a closed [interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics) "Interval (mathematics)") or closed n-ball.

For any metric space (_X_, _d_), the following are equivalent (assuming [countable choice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countable_choice "Countable choice")):

1.   (_X_, _d_) is compact.
2.   (_X_, _d_) is [complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Completeness_(topology) "Completeness (topology)") and [totally bounded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totally_bounded "Totally bounded") (this is also equivalent to compactness for [uniform spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_space "Uniform space")).[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space#cite_note-14)
3.   (_X_, _d_) is sequentially compact; that is, every [sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence "Sequence") in X has a convergent subsequence whose limit is in X (this is also equivalent to compactness for [first-countable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-countable "First-countable")[uniform spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_space "Uniform space")).
4.   (_X_, _d_) is [limit point compact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_point_compact "Limit point compact") (also called weakly countably compact); that is, every infinite subset of X has at least one [limit point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_point_of_a_set "Limit point of a set") in X.
5.   (_X_, _d_) is [countably compact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countably_compact "Countably compact"); that is, every countable open cover of X has a finite subcover.
6.   (_X_, _d_) is an image of a continuous function from the [Cantor set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor_set "Cantor set").[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space#cite_note-15)
7.   Every decreasing nested sequence of nonempty closed subsets _S_ 1 ⊇ _S_ 2 ⊇ ... in (_X_, _d_) has a nonempty intersection.
8.   Every increasing nested sequence of proper open subsets _S_ 1 ⊆ _S_ 2 ⊆ ... in (_X_, _d_) fails to cover X.

A compact metric space (_X_, _d_) also satisfies the following properties:

1.   [Lebesgue's number lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebesgue%27s_number_lemma "Lebesgue's number lemma"): For every open cover of X, there exists a number _δ_> 0 such that every subset of X of diameter <δ is contained in some member of the cover.
2.   (_X_, _d_) is [second-countable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-countable_space "Second-countable space"), [separable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separable_space "Separable space") and [Lindelöf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindel%C3%B6f_space "Lindelöf space")– these three conditions are equivalent for metric spaces. The converse is not true; e.g., a countable discrete space satisfies these three conditions, but is not compact.
3.   X is closed and bounded (as a subset of any metric space whose restricted metric is d). The converse may fail for a non-Euclidean space; e.g. the [real line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_line "Real line") equipped with the [discrete metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_metric "Discrete metric") is closed and bounded but not compact, as the collection of all [singletons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_(mathematics) "Singleton (mathematics)") of the space is an open cover which admits no finite subcover. It is complete but not totally bounded.

For an ordered space (_X_, <) (i.e. a totally ordered set equipped with the order topology), the following are equivalent:

1.   (_X_, <) is compact.
2.   Every subset of X has a supremum (i.e. a least upper bound) in X.
3.   Every subset of X has an infimum (i.e. a greatest lower bound) in X.
4.   Every nonempty closed subset of X has a maximum and a minimum element.

An ordered space satisfying (any one of) these conditions is called a complete lattice.

In addition, the following are equivalent for all ordered spaces (_X_, <), and (assuming [countable choice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countable_choice "Countable choice")) are true whenever (_X_, <) is compact. (The converse in general fails if (_X_, <) is not also metrizable.):

1.   Every sequence in (_X_, <) has a subsequence that converges in (_X_, <).
2.   Every monotone increasing sequence in X converges to a unique limit in X.
3.   Every monotone decreasing sequence in X converges to a unique limit in X.
4.   Every decreasing nested sequence of nonempty closed subsets S 1 ⊇ S 2 ⊇ ... in (_X_, <) has a nonempty intersection.
5.   Every increasing nested sequence of proper open subsets S 1 ⊆ S 2 ⊆ ... in (_X_, <) fails to cover X.

#### Characterization by continuous functions

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Compact_space&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Characterization by continuous functions")]

Let X be a topological space and C(_X_) the ring of real continuous functions on X. For each _p_ ∈ _X_, the evaluation map ![Image 13: {\displaystyle \operatorname {ev} _{p}\colon C(X)\to \mathbb {R} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7e8866d64e224786e38571ce6adabbc5fd3923bc) given by ev _p_(_f_) = _f_(_p_) is a ring homomorphism. The [kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(algebra) "Kernel (algebra)") of ev _p_ is a [maximal ideal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximal_ideal "Maximal ideal"), since the [residue field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residue_field "Residue field")C(_X_)/ker ev _p_ is the field of real numbers, by the [first isomorphism theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_isomorphism_theorem "First isomorphism theorem"). A topological space X is [pseudocompact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocompact_space "Pseudocompact space") if and only if every maximal ideal in C(_X_) has residue field the real numbers. For [completely regular spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Completely_regular_space "Completely regular space"), this is equivalent to every maximal ideal being the kernel of an evaluation homomorphism.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space#cite_note-16) There are pseudocompact spaces that are not compact, though.

In general, for non-pseudocompact spaces there are always maximal ideals m in C(_X_) such that the residue field C(_X_)/_m_ is a ([non-Archimedean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-archimedean_field "Non-archimedean field")) [hyperreal field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperreal_field "Hyperreal field"). The framework of [non-standard analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-standard_analysis "Non-standard analysis") allows for the following alternative characterization of compactness:[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space#cite_note-17) a topological space X is compact if and only if every point x of the natural extension _*X_ is [infinitely close](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinitesimal "Infinitesimal") to a point _x_ 0 of X (more precisely, x is contained in the [monad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(non-standard_analysis) "Monad (non-standard analysis)") of _x_ 0).

#### Hyperreal definition

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Compact_space&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Hyperreal definition")]

A space X is compact if its [hyperreal extension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperreal_number "Hyperreal number")_*X_ (constructed, for example, by the [ultrapower construction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrapower_construction "Ultrapower construction")) has the property that every point of _*X_ is infinitely close to some point of _X_ ⊂ _*X_. For example, an open real interval _X_ = (0, 1) is not compact because its hyperreal extension *(0,1) contains infinitesimals, which are infinitely close to 0, which is not a point of X.

Sufficient conditions
---------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Compact_space&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Sufficient conditions")]

*   A closed subset of a compact space is compact.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space#cite_note-18)
*   A finite [union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_(set_theory) "Union (set theory)") of compact sets is compact.
*   A [continuous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function_(topology) "Continuous function (topology)") image of a compact space is compact.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space#cite_note-19)
*   The intersection of any non-empty collection of compact subsets of a Hausdorff space is compact (and closed); 
    *   If X is not Hausdorff then the intersection of two compact subsets may fail to be compact (see footnote for example).[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space#cite_note-20)

*   The [product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_topology "Product topology") of any collection of compact spaces is compact. (This is [Tychonoff's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tychonoff%27s_theorem "Tychonoff's theorem"), which is equivalent to the [axiom of choice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_choice "Axiom of choice").)
*   In a [metrizable space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metrizable_space "Metrizable space"), a subset is compact if and only if it is [sequentially compact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequentially_compact "Sequentially compact") (assuming [countable choice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_countable_choice "Axiom of countable choice"))
*   A finite set endowed with any topology is compact.

Properties of compact spaces
----------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Compact_space&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Properties of compact spaces")]

*   A compact subset of a [Hausdorff space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_space "Hausdorff space")X is closed. 
    *   If X is not Hausdorff then a compact subset of X may fail to be a closed subset of X (see footnote for example).[[b]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space#cite_note-21)
    *   If X is not Hausdorff then the closure of a compact set may fail to be compact (see footnote for example).[[c]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space#cite_note-22)

*   In any [topological vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_vector_space "Topological vector space") (TVS), a compact subset is [complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_space "Complete space"). However, every non-Hausdorff TVS contains compact (and thus complete) subsets that are _not_ closed.
*   If A and B are disjoint compact subsets of a Hausdorff space X, then there exist disjoint open sets U and V in X such that _A_ ⊆ _U_ and _B_ ⊆ _V_.
*   A continuous bijection from a compact space into a Hausdorff space is a [homeomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeomorphism "Homeomorphism").
*   A compact Hausdorff space is [normal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_space "Normal space") and [regular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_space "Regular space").
*   If a space X is compact and Hausdorff, then no finer topology on X is compact and no coarser topology on X is Hausdorff.
*   If a subset of a metric space (_X_, _d_) is compact then it is d-bounded.

### Functions and compact spaces

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Compact_space&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Functions and compact spaces")]

Since a [continuous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function_(topology) "Continuous function (topology)") image of a compact space is compact, the [extreme value theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_value_theorem "Extreme value theorem") holds for such spaces: a continuous real-valued function on a nonempty compact space is bounded above and attains its supremum.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space#cite_note-23) (Slightly more generally, this is true for an upper semicontinuous function.) As a sort of converse to the above statements, the pre-image of a compact space under a [proper map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_map "Proper map") is compact.

Every topological space X is an open [dense subspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dense_topological_subspace "Dense topological subspace") of a compact space having at most one point more than X, by the [Alexandroff one-point compactification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandroff_one-point_compactification "Alexandroff one-point compactification"). By the same construction, every [locally compact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locally_compact "Locally compact") Hausdorff space X is an open dense subspace of a compact Hausdorff space having at most one point more than X.

### Ordered compact spaces

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Compact_space&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Ordered compact spaces")]

A nonempty compact subset of the [real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number") has a greatest element and a least element.

Let X be a [simply ordered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_order "Total order") set endowed with the [order topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_topology "Order topology"). Then X is compact if and only if X is a [complete lattice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_lattice "Complete lattice") (i.e. all subsets have suprema and infima).[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space#cite_note-24)

*   Any [finite topological space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_topological_space "Finite topological space"), including the [empty set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empty_set "Empty set"), is compact. More generally, any space with a [finite topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_topology "Finite topology") (only finitely many open sets) is compact; this includes in particular the [trivial topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trivial_topology "Trivial topology").
*   Any space carrying the [cofinite topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cofinite_topology "Cofinite topology") is compact.
*   Any [locally compact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locally_compact "Locally compact") Hausdorff space can be turned into a compact space by adding a single point to it, by means of [Alexandroff one-point compactification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandroff_one-point_compactification "Alexandroff one-point compactification"). The one-point compactification of ![Image 14: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/786849c765da7a84dbc3cce43e96aad58a5868dc) is homeomorphic to the circle **S**1; the one-point compactification of ![Image 15: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e150115ab9f63023215109595b76686a1ff890fd) is homeomorphic to the sphere **S**2. Using the one-point compactification, one can also easily construct compact spaces which are not Hausdorff, by starting with a non-Hausdorff space.
*   The [right order topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_order_topology "Right order topology") or [left order topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_order_topology "Left order topology") on any bounded [totally ordered set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totally_ordered_set "Totally ordered set") is compact. In particular, [Sierpiński space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpi%C5%84ski_space "Sierpiński space") is compact.
*   No [discrete space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_space "Discrete space") with an infinite number of points is compact. The collection of all [singletons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_(mathematics) "Singleton (mathematics)") of the space is an open cover which admits no finite subcover. Finite discrete spaces are compact.
*   In ![Image 16: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/786849c765da7a84dbc3cce43e96aad58a5868dc) carrying the [lower limit topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_limit_topology "Lower limit topology"), no uncountable set is compact.
*   In the [cocountable topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocountable_topology "Cocountable topology") on an uncountable set, no infinite set is compact. Like the previous example, the space as a whole is not [locally compact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locally_compact "Locally compact") but is still [Lindelöf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindel%C3%B6f_space "Lindelöf space").
*   The closed [unit interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_interval "Unit interval")[0, 1] is compact. This follows from the [Heine–Borel theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heine%E2%80%93Borel_theorem "Heine–Borel theorem"). The open interval (0, 1) is not compact: the [open cover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_cover "Open cover")![Image 17: {\textstyle \left({\frac {1}{n}},1-{\frac {1}{n}}\right)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c2b7b7ae8290bf973c0d47bfc9e99105a9e194ea) for n = 3, 4, ...  does not have a finite subcover. Similarly, the set of _[rational numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational\_numbers "Rational numbers")_ in the closed interval [0,1] is not compact: the sets of rational numbers in the intervals ![Image 18: {\textstyle \left[0,{\frac {1}{\pi }}-{\frac {1}{n}}\right]{\text{ and }}\left[{\frac {1}{\pi }}+{\frac {1}{n}},1\right]}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/cd15c0d260a029851c6acad5e36712fbb0f88c71) cover all the rationals in [0,1] for n = 4, 5, ...  but this cover does not have a finite subcover. Here, the sets are open in the subspace topology even though they are not open as subsets of![Image 19: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/786849c765da7a84dbc3cce43e96aad58a5868dc).
*   The set ![Image 20: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/786849c765da7a84dbc3cce43e96aad58a5868dc) of all real numbers is not compact as there is a cover of open intervals that does not have a finite subcover. For example, intervals (n − 1, n + 1), where n takes all integer values in **Z**, cover ![Image 21: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/786849c765da7a84dbc3cce43e96aad58a5868dc) but there is no finite subcover.
*   On the other hand, the [extended real number line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_real_number_line "Extended real number line") carrying the analogous topology _is_ compact; note that the cover described above would never reach the points at infinity and thus would _not_ cover the extended real line. In fact, the set has the [homeomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeomorphism "Homeomorphism") to [−1,1] of mapping each infinity to its corresponding unit and every real number to its sign multiplied by the unique number in the positive part of interval that results in its absolute value when divided by one minus itself, and since homeomorphisms preserve covers, the Heine-Borel property can be inferred.
*   For every [natural number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number "Natural number")n, the [n-sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-sphere "N-sphere") is compact. Again from the Heine–Borel theorem, the closed unit ball of any finite-dimensional [normed vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normed_vector_space "Normed vector space") is compact. This is not true for infinite dimensions; in fact, a normed vector space is finite-dimensional if and only if its [closed unit ball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_unit_ball "Closed unit ball") is compact.
*   On the other hand, the closed unit ball of the dual of a normed space is compact for the weak-* topology. ([Alaoglu's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaoglu%27s_theorem "Alaoglu's theorem"))
*   The [Cantor set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor_set "Cantor set") is compact. In fact, every compact metric space is a continuous image of the Cantor set.
*   Consider the set K of all functions _f_: **R** → [0, 1] from the real number line to the closed unit interval, and define a topology on K so that a sequence ![Image 22: {\displaystyle \{f_{n}\}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/009619e33115347a277b099ff493347bdd5776aa) in K converges towards _f_ ∈ _K_ if and only if ![Image 23: {\displaystyle \{f_{n}(x)\}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/db082772469c125b07c34485abb261915262e57f) converges towards _f_(_x_) for all real numbers x. There is only one such topology; it is called the topology of [pointwise convergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointwise_convergence "Pointwise convergence") or the [product topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_topology "Product topology"). Then K is a compact topological space; this follows from the [Tychonoff theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tychonoff_theorem "Tychonoff theorem").
*   A subset of the Banach space of real-valued continuous functions on a compact Hausdorff space is relatively compact if and only if it is equicontinuous and pointwise bounded ([Arzelà–Ascoli theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arzel%C3%A0%E2%80%93Ascoli_theorem "Arzelà–Ascoli theorem")).
*   Consider the set K of all functions _f_: [0, 1]→ [0, 1] satisfying the [Lipschitz condition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipschitz_condition "Lipschitz condition")|_f_(_x_)−_f_(_y_)|≤ |_x_−_y_| for all _x_,_y_∈[0,1]. Consider on K the metric induced by the [uniform distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_convergence "Uniform convergence")![Image 24: {\displaystyle d(f,g)=\sup _{x\in [0,1]}|f(x)-g(x)|.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d4968cb9f2028481e49bb5c4a09a337ae1840ce7) Then by the Arzelà–Ascoli theorem the space K is compact.
*   The [spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum_of_an_operator "Spectrum of an operator") of any [bounded linear operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounded_linear_operator "Bounded linear operator") on a [Banach space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach_space "Banach space") is a nonempty compact subset of the [complex numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number "Complex number")![Image 25: {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f9add4085095b9b6d28d045fd9c92c2c09f549a7). Conversely, any compact subset of ![Image 26: {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f9add4085095b9b6d28d045fd9c92c2c09f549a7) arises in this manner, as the spectrum of some bounded linear operator. For instance, a diagonal operator on the Hilbert space [![Image 27: {\displaystyle \ell ^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/91f1f909abd70bd3d8fff0f7ae1ac23052387e18)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_spaces#%E2%84%93p_spaces "Sequence spaces") may have any compact nonempty subset of ![Image 28: {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f9add4085095b9b6d28d045fd9c92c2c09f549a7) as spectrum.
*   The space of Borel [probability measures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_measure "Probability measure") on a compact Hausdorff space is compact for the [vague topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vague_topology "Vague topology"), by the Alaoglu theorem.
*   A collection of probability measures on the Borel sets of Euclidean space is called _tight_ if, for any positive epsilon, there exists a compact subset containing all but at most epsilon of the mass of each of the measures. Helly's theorem then asserts that a collection of probability measures is relatively compact for the vague topology if and only if it is tight.

*   [Topological groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_group "Topological group") such as an [orthogonal group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_group "Orthogonal group") are compact, while groups such as a [general linear group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_linear_group "General linear group") are not.
*   Since the [p-adic integers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-adic_numbers "P-adic numbers") are [homeomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeomorphic "Homeomorphic") to the Cantor set, they form a compact set.
*   Any [global field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_field "Global field")_K_ is a discrete additive subgroup of its [adele ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adele_ring "Adele ring"), and the quotient space is compact. This was used in [John Tate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tate_(mathematician) "John Tate (mathematician)")'s [thesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tate%27s_thesis "Tate's thesis") to allow [harmonic analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_analysis "Harmonic analysis") to be used in [number theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory "Number theory").
*   The [spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum_of_a_ring "Spectrum of a ring") of any [commutative ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_ring "Commutative ring") with the [Zariski topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zariski_topology "Zariski topology") (that is, the set of all prime ideals) is compact, but never [Hausdorff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_space "Hausdorff space") (except in trivial cases). In algebraic geometry, such topological spaces are examples of quasi-compact [schemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(mathematics) "Scheme (mathematics)"), "quasi" referring to the non-Hausdorff nature of the topology.
*   The spectrum of a [Boolean algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra "Boolean algebra") is compact, a fact which is part of the [Stone representation theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_representation_theorem "Stone representation theorem"). [Stone spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_space "Stone space"), compact [totally disconnected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totally_disconnected_space "Totally disconnected space") Hausdorff spaces, form the abstract framework in which these spectra are studied. Such spaces are also useful in the study of [profinite groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profinite_group "Profinite group").
*   The [structure space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_space "Structure space") of a commutative unital [Banach algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach_algebra "Banach algebra") is a compact Hausdorff space.
*   The [Hilbert cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_cube "Hilbert cube") is compact, again a consequence of Tychonoff's theorem.
*   A [profinite group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profinite_group "Profinite group") (e.g. [Galois group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois_group "Galois group")) is compact.

1.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space#cite_ref-20)** Let _X_ = {_a_, _b_} ∪ ![Image 29: {\displaystyle \mathbb {N} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fdf9a96b565ea202d0f4322e9195613fb26a9bed), _U_ = {_a_} ∪ ![Image 30: {\displaystyle \mathbb {N} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fdf9a96b565ea202d0f4322e9195613fb26a9bed), and _V_ = {_b_} ∪ ![Image 31: {\displaystyle \mathbb {N} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fdf9a96b565ea202d0f4322e9195613fb26a9bed). Endow X with the topology generated by the following basic open sets: every subset of ![Image 32: {\displaystyle \mathbb {N} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fdf9a96b565ea202d0f4322e9195613fb26a9bed) is open; the only open sets containing a are X and U; and the only open sets containing b are X and V. Then U and V are both compact subsets but their intersection, which is ![Image 33: {\displaystyle \mathbb {N} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fdf9a96b565ea202d0f4322e9195613fb26a9bed), is not compact. Note that both U and V are compact open subsets, neither one of which is closed.
2.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space#cite_ref-21)** Let _X_ = {_a_, _b_} and endow X with the topology {_X_, ∅, {_a_}}. Then {_a_} is a compact set but it is not closed.
3.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space#cite_ref-22)** Let X be the set of non-negative integers. We endow X with the [particular point topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particular_point_topology "Particular point topology") by defining a subset _U_ ⊆ _X_ to be open if and only if 0 ∈ _U_. Then _S_:= {0} is compact, the closure of S is all of X, but X is not compact since the collection of open subsets {{0, _x_}: _x_ ∈ _X_} does not have a finite subcover.
