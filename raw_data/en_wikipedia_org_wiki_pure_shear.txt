[ 1 ] It is an example of irrotational strain in which body is elongated in one direction while being shortened perpendicularly . For soft materials, such as rubber, a strain state of pure shear is often used for characterizing hyperelastic and fracture mechanical behaviour.

[ 2 ] Pure shear is differentiated from simple shear in that pure shear involves no rigid body rotation.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] The deformation gradient for pure shear is given by: F = [ 1 γ γ 0 γ γ 1 0 0 0 1 ] {\displaystyle F={\begin{bmatrix}1&\gamma &0\\\gamma &1&0\\0&0&1\end{bmatrix}}} Note that this gives a Green-Lagrange strain of: E = 1 2 [ γ γ 2 2 γ γ 0 2 γ γ γ γ 2 0 0 0 0 ] {\displaystyle E={\frac {1}{2}}{\begin{bmatrix}\gamma ^{2}&2\gamma &0\\2\gamma &\gamma ^{2}&0\\0&0&0\end{bmatrix}}} Here there is no rotation occurring, which can be seen from the equal off-diagonal components of the strain tensor. The linear approximation to the Green-Lagrange strain shows that the small strain tensor is: ϵ ϵ = 1 2 [ 0 2 γ γ 0 2 γ γ 0 0 0 0 0 ] {\displaystyle \epsilon ={\frac {1}{2}}{\begin{bmatrix}0&2\gamma &0\\2\gamma &0&0\\0&0&0\end{bmatrix}}} which has only shearing components.
