The symbol **#** is known as the **number sign**,[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign#cite_note-oedNumberSign-1)**hash**,[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign#cite_note-oedHash-2) or (in North America) the **pound sign**.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign#cite_note-3) The symbol has historically been used for a wide range of purposes including the designation of an ordinal number and as a [ligatured](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typographic_ligature "Typographic ligature") abbreviation for [pounds avoirdupois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_(mass) "Pound (mass)") – having been derived from the now-rare ℔.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign#cite_note-Houston-4)

Since 2007, widespread usage of the symbol to introduce [metadata tags](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata_tag "Metadata tag") on [social media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media "Social media") platforms has led to such tags being known as "[hashtags](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashtag "Hashtag")",[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign#cite_note-5) and from that, the symbol itself is sometimes called a **hashtag**.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign#cite_note-hashtag-6)

The symbol is distinguished from similar symbols by its combination of level horizontal strokes and right-tilting vertical strokes.

A stylized version of the abbreviation for _[libra pondo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman\_pound "Roman pound")_ ("pound weight")

[![Image 2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Libra_pondo_abbreviation_newton.jpg/250px-Libra_pondo_abbreviation_newton.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Libra_pondo_abbreviation_newton.jpg)

The abbreviation written by [Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton"), showing the evolution from "℔" toward "#"

It is believed that the symbol traces its origins to the symbol ⟨[℔](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E2%84%94 "wikt:℔")⟩,[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign#cite_note-7) an abbreviation of the Roman term _[libra pondo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman\_pound "Roman pound")_, which translates as "pound weight".[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign#cite_note-8)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign#cite_note-NewYorker-9) The abbreviation "lb" was printed as a dedicated [ligature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligature_(writing) "Ligature (writing)") including a horizontal line across (which indicated abbreviation).[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign#cite_note-10)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign#cite_note-NewYorker-9) Ultimately, the symbol was reduced for clarity as an overlay of two horizontal strokes "=" across two slash-like strokes "//".[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign#cite_note-NewYorker-9)

The symbol is described as the "number" character in an 1853 treatise on [bookkeeping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookkeeping "Bookkeeping"),[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign#cite_note-11) and its double meaning is described in a bookkeeping text from 1880.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign#cite_note-12) The instruction manual of the [Blickensderfer model 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blickensderfer_typewriter#Model_5 "Blickensderfer typewriter") typewriter (c. 1896) appears to refer to the symbol as the "number mark".[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign#cite_note-13) Some early-20th-century U.S. sources refer to it as the "number sign",[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign#cite_note-14) although this could also refer to the [numero sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numero_sign "Numero sign") (№).[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign#cite_note-15) A 1917 manual distinguishes between two uses of the sign: "number (written before a figure)" and "pounds (written after a figure)".[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign#cite_note-16) The use of the phrase "pound sign" to refer to this symbol is found from 1932 in U.S. usage.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign#cite_note-17) The term _hash sign_ is found in South African writings from the late 1960s[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign#cite_note-18) and from other non-North-American sources in the 1970s.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

For mechanical devices, the symbol appeared on the keyboard of the [Remington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._Remington_and_Sons "E. Remington and Sons") Standard typewriter (c. 1886).[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign#cite_note-19) It appeared in many of the early teleprinter codes and from there was copied to [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII "ASCII"), which made it available on computers and thus caused many more uses to be found for the character. The symbol was introduced on the bottom right button of [touch-tone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push-button_telephone "Push-button telephone") keypads in 1968, but that button was not extensively used until the advent of large-scale [voicemail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voicemail "Voicemail") (PBX systems, etc.) in the early 1980s.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign#cite_note-Houston-4)

One of the uses in computers was to label the following text as having a different interpretation (such as a command or a comment) from the rest of the text. It was adopted for use within internet relay chat ([IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat "Internet Relay Chat")) networks circa 1988 to label groups and topics.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign#cite_note-20) This usage inspired [Chris Messina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Messina_(open_source_advocate) "Chris Messina (open source advocate)") to propose a similar system to be used on [Twitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter "Twitter") to tag topics of interest on the microblogging network;[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign#cite_note-21)[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign#cite_note-22) this became known as a [hashtag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashtag "Hashtag"). Although used initially and most popularly on Twitter, hashtag use has extended to other social media sites.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign#cite_note-23)

**Number sign**

"Number sign" is the name chosen by the [Unicode Consortium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_Consortium "Unicode Consortium"). Most common in Canada[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign#cite_note-24) and the northeastern United States.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] American telephone equipment companies which serve Canadian callers often have an option in their programming to denote [Canadian English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_English "Canadian English"), which in turn instructs the system to say _number sign_ to callers instead of _pound_.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign#cite_note-25) This name is rarely used elsewhere in the world, where numbers are normally represented by the letters "[No.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numero_sign "Numero sign")".
**Pound sign or pound**

In the United States and Canada, the "#" key on a phone is commonly referred to as the pound sign, _pound key_, or simply _pound_. Dialing instructions to an extension such as #77, for example, can be read as "pound seven seven".[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign#cite_note-nyt-26) This name is rarely used elsewhere, as the term _pound sign_ is understood to mean [the currency symbol £](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sign "Pound sign").
**Hash, [hash mark](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hash_mark "wikt:hash mark"), [hashmark](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hashmark "wikt:hashmark")**

In the United Kingdom,[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign#cite_note-27) Australia,[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign#cite_note-28) and some other countries,[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] it is frequently called a "hash" (probably from "hatch", referring to cross-[hatching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatching "Hatching")[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign#cite_note-29)).Programmers also use this term; for instance `#!` is "hash, bang" or ["shebang"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix) "Shebang (Unix)").
**[Hashtag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashtag "Hashtag")**

Derived from the previous, the word "hashtag" is often used when reading social media messages aloud, indicating the start of a hashtag. For instance, the text "#foo" is often read out loud as "hashtag foo" (as opposed to "hash foo"). This leads to the common belief that the symbol itself is called _hashtag_.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign#cite_note-hashtag-6) Twitter documentation refers to it as "the hashtag symbol".[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign#cite_note-30)
**Hex**

"Hex" is commonly used in Singapore and Malaysia, as spoken by many recorded telephone directory-assistance menus: "Please enter your phone number followed by the 'hex' key". The term "hex" is discouraged in Singapore in favour of "hash". In Singapore, a hash is also called "hex" in apartment addresses, where it precedes the floor number.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign#cite_note-31)[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign#cite_note-32)
**[Octothorp](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/octothorp "wikt:octothorp"), [octothorpe](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/octothorpe "wikt:octothorpe"), octathorp, octatherp**

Most scholars believe the word was invented by workers at the [Bell Telephone Laboratories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs "Bell Labs") by 1968,[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign#cite_note-33) who needed a word for the symbol on the [telephone keypad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-tone_multi-frequency_signaling "Dual-tone multi-frequency signaling"). Don MacPherson is said to have created the word by combining _octo_ and the last name of [Jim Thorpe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Thorpe "Jim Thorpe"), an Olympic medalist.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign#cite_note-34) Howard Eby and Lauren Asplund claim to have invented the word as a joke in 1964, combining _octo_ with the syllable _therp_ which, because of the "th" [digraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digraph_(orthography) "Digraph (orthography)"), was hard to pronounce in different languages.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign#cite_note-Kerr-35)_The Merriam-Webster New Book of Word Histories_, 1991, has a long article that is consistent with Doug Kerr's essay,[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign#cite_note-Kerr-35) which says "octotherp" was the original spelling, and that the word arose in the 1960s among telephone engineers as a joke. Other hypotheses for the origin of the word include the last name of [James Oglethorpe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Oglethorpe "James Oglethorpe")[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign#cite_note-36) or using the Old English word for village, _[thorp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorp "Thorp")_, because the symbol looks like a village surrounded by eight fields.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign#cite_note-37)[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign#cite_note-38) The word was popularized within and outside Bell Labs.[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign#cite_note-39) The first appearance of "octothorp" in a US patent is in a 1973 filing. This patent also refers to the six-pointed asterisk (✻) used on telephone buttons as a "[sextile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrological_aspect#Sextile "Astrological aspect")".[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign#cite_note-40)
**[Sharp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharp_(music) "Sharp (music)")**

Use of the name "sharp" is due to the symbol's resemblance to U+266F♯[MUSIC SHARP SIGN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E2%99%AF "♯"). The same derivation is seen in the name of the [Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft "Microsoft") programming languages [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language) "C Sharp (programming language)"), [J#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J_Sharp "J Sharp") and [F#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F_Sharp_(programming_language) "F Sharp (programming language)"). Microsoft says that the name _C#_ is pronounced 'see sharp'."[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign#cite_note-41) According to the ECMA-334 C# Language Specification, the name of the language is written "C#" ("LATIN CAPITAL LETTER C (U+0043) followed by the NUMBER SIGN # (U+0023)") and pronounced "C Sharp".[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign#cite_note-42)
**Square**

[![Image 3](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Detail-Tastatur-FeTAp-751-1982.JPG/250px-Detail-Tastatur-FeTAp-751-1982.JPG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Detail-Tastatur-FeTAp-751-1982.JPG)

Detail of a telephone keypad displaying the [Viewdata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viewdata "Viewdata") square

On telephones, the [International Telecommunication Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Telecommunication_Union "International Telecommunication Union") specification [ITU-T E.161](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.161 "E.161") 3.2.2 states: "The symbol may be referred to as the square or the most commonly used equivalent term in other languages."[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign#cite_note-43) Formally, this is not a number sign but rather another character, U+2317⌗[VIEWDATA SQUARE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E2%8C%97 "⌗"). The real or virtual keypads on almost all modern telephones use the simple `#` instead, as does most documentation.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]
When ⟨#⟩ prefixes a number, it is read as "number". "A #2 pencil", for example, indicates "a number-two pencil". This usage is rare in print,[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign#cite_note-44) or outside North America. Instead the abbreviation 'No.' or the symbol '№' or just "number" is used.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

When ⟨#⟩ is _after_ a number, it is read as "pound" or "pounds", meaning the unit of weight.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign#cite_note-45)[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign#cite_note-46) The text "5# bag of flour" would mean "five-pound bag of flour". This is rare outside North America.

*   In [set theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory "Set theory"), #_S_ is one possible notation for the [cardinality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality "Cardinality") or size of the [set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics) "Set (mathematics)")_S_, instead of ![Image 4: {\displaystyle |S|}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/28d901e98a035ff4c0e37fe6dd8e750ece6c1f0b). That is, for a set ![Image 5: {\displaystyle S=\{s_{1},s_{2},s_{3},\dots ,s_{n}\}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8870b24af1ca41af195fe8127f7a2c84b94a5cb9), in which all ![Image 6: {\displaystyle s_{i}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/cfda82668232cbdc0874ed28ab8b6079420d1ffe) are mutually distinct, ![Image 7: {\displaystyle \#S=n=|S|.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8b69446e0babbd83ec846a20130eb1015eb93344) This notation is only sometimes used for [finite sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_set "Finite set"), usually in [number theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory "Number theory"), to avoid confusion with the [divisibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divisibility "Divisibility") symbol, e.g. ![Image 8: {\displaystyle a\mid b}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/70ab1c16db0f00b6cc26bcd7dae49514f5aadfff).
*   In [topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology "Topology"), _A_#_B_ is the [connected sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_sum "Connected sum") of [manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold "Manifold")_A_ and _B_, or of knots _A_ and _B_ in [knot theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory "Knot theory").
*   In [number theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory "Number theory"), _n_# is the [primorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primorial "Primorial") of _n_.
*   In [constructive mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_mathematics "Constructive mathematics"), # denotes an [apartness relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartness_relation "Apartness relation").
*   In [computational complexity theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity_theory "Computational complexity theory"), [#P](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E2%99%AFP "♯P") denotes a [complexity class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity_class "Complexity class") of [counting problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counting_problem_(complexity) "Counting problem (complexity)"). The standard notation for this class uses the number sign symbol, not the [sharp sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharp_sign "Sharp sign") from music, but it is pronounced "sharp P". More generally, the number sign may be used to denote the class of counting problems associated with any class of search problems.

*   In [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode "Unicode") and [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII "ASCII"), the symbol has a [code point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_point "Code point") as U+0023#NUMBER SIGN and [entity code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_code "Entity code")`&num;` in [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5 "HTML5").[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign#cite_note-47)
*   In many scripting languages and data file formats, especially ones that originated on Unix, `#` introduces a comment that goes to the end of the line.[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign#cite_note-hash_character-48) The combination `#!` at the start of an executable file is a "[shebang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix) "Shebang (Unix)")", "hash-bang" or "pound-bang", used to tell the operating system which program to use to run the script (see [magic number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming) "Magic number (programming)")). This combination was chosen so it would be a comment in the scripting languages. 
    *   `#!` is the symbol of the [CrunchBang Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CrunchBang_Linux "CrunchBang Linux") distribution.

*   In the [Perl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl "Perl") programming language, `#` is used as a modifier to array syntax to return the index number of the last element in the [array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_data_type "Array data type"), e.g., an array's last element is at `$array[$#array]`. The number of elements in the array is `$#array + 1`, since Perl arrays default to using zero-based indices. If the array has not been defined, the return is also undefined. If the array is defined but has not had any elements assigned to it, e.g., `@array = ()`, then `$#array` returns `−1`. See the section on [Array functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl_language_structure#Array_functions "Perl language structure") in the Perl language structure article.
*   In both the [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_preprocessor "C preprocessor") and [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B "C++") preprocessors, as well as in other syntactically C-like languages, `#` is used to start a preprocessor [directive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directive_(programming) "Directive (programming)"). Inside macros, after `#define`, it is used for various purposes; for example, the double pound (hash) sign `##` is used for token [concatenation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concatenation "Concatenation").
*   In [Unix shells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell "Unix shell"), `#` is placed by convention at the end of a [command prompt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_prompt "Command prompt") to denote that the user is working as [root](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superuser "Superuser").
*   `#` is used in a [URL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL "URL") of a [web page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_page "Web page") or other resource to introduce a "[fragment identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragment_identifier "Fragment identifier")" – an id which defines a position within that resource. In HTML, this is known as an [anchor link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_element#Anchor "HTML element"). For example, in the URL `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign#Computing` the portion after the `#` (`Computing`) is the fragment identifier, in this case denoting that the display should be moved to show the tag marked by `<span id="Computing">...</span>` in the HTML.[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign#cite_note-49)
*   [Internet Relay Chat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat "Internet Relay Chat"): on (IRC) servers, `#` precedes the name of every [channel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRC_channels "IRC channels") that is available across an entire IRC network.
*   In [blogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog "Blog"), `#` is sometimes used to denote a [permalink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permalink "Permalink") for that particular weblog entry.
*   In [lightweight markup languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_markup_language "Lightweight markup language"), such as [wikitext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki "Wiki"), `#` is often used to introduce numbered list items.
*   `#` is used in the [Modula-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modula-2 "Modula-2") and [Oberon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberon_(programming_language) "Oberon (programming language)") programming languages designed by [Niklaus Wirth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklaus_Wirth "Niklaus Wirth") and in the [Component Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_Pascal "Component Pascal") language derived from Oberon to denote the _not equal_ symbol, as a stand-in for the mathematical unequal sign ≠, being more intuitive than `<>` or `!=`. For example: `IF i # 0 THEN ...`
*   In [Rust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language) "Rust (programming language)"), `#` is used for attributes such as in `#[test]`.
*   In [OCaml](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCaml "OCaml"), `#` is the operator used to call a method.
*   In [Common Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp "Common Lisp"),[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign#cite_note-50)`#` is a dispatching [read macro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_reader "Lisp reader") character used to extend the [S-expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-expression "S-expression") syntax with short cuts and support for various data types ([complex numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number "Complex number"), vectors and more).
*   In [Scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language) "Scheme (programming language)"), `#` is the prefix for certain syntax with special meaning.
*   In [Standard ML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_ML "Standard ML"), `#`, when prefixed to a field name, becomes a projection function (function to access the field of a record or tuple); also, `#` prefixes a [string literal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_literal "String literal") to turn it into a character literal.
*   In [Mathematica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfram_Mathematica "Wolfram Mathematica") syntax, `#`, when used as a variable, becomes a pure function (a placeholder that is mapped to any variable meeting the conditions).
*   In [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX "LaTeX"), `#`, when prefixing a number, references an arguments for a user defined command. For instance `\newcommand{\code}[1]{\texttt{#1}}`.
*   In [Javadoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javadoc "Javadoc"),[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign#cite_note-51)`#` is used with the `@see` tag to introduce or separate a field, constructor, or method member from its containing class.
*   In [Redcode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_War "Core War") and some other dialects of [assembly language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language "Assembly language"), `#` is used to denote immediate mode addressing, e.g., `LDA #10`, which means "load accumulator A with the value 10" in [MOS 6502](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_6502 "MOS 6502") assembly language.
*   in [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML "HTML"), [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets "Cascading Style Sheets"), [SVG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics "Scalable Vector Graphics"), and other computing applications `#` is used to identify a color specified in [hexadecimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal "Hexadecimal") format, e.g., `#FFAA00`. This usage comes from [X11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X11 "X11") color specifications, which inherited it from early assembler dialects that used `#` to prefix hexadecimal constants, e.g.: ZX Spectrum [Z80](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zilog_Z80 "Zilog Z80") assembly.[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign#cite_note-52)
*   In [Be-Music Script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Be-Music_Script "Be-Music Script"), every command line starts with `#`. Lines starting with characters other than "#" are treated as comments.
*   The use of the hash symbol in a [hashtag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashtag "Hashtag") is a phenomenon conceived by [Chris Messina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Messina_(open-source_advocate) "Chris Messina (open-source advocate)"), and popularized by social media network [Twitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter "Twitter"), as a way to direct conversations and topics amongst users. This has led to an increasingly common tendency to refer to the symbol itself as "hashtag".[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign#cite_note-Time-53)
*   In programming languages like PL/1 and Assembler used on IBM mainframe systems, as well as JCL (Job Control Language), the `#` (along with `$` and `@`) are used as additional letters in identifiers, labels and data set names.
*   In [J](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J_(programming_language) "J (programming language)"), `#` is the _Tally_ or _Count_ function,[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign#cite_note-54) and similarly in [Lua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_(programming_language) "Lua (programming language)"), `#` can be used as a shortcut to get the length of a table, or get the length of a string. Due to the ease of writing "#" over longer function names, this practice has become standard in the Lua community.
*   In Dyalog [APL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_(programming_language) "APL (programming language)"), `#` is a reference to the root [namespace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namespace "Namespace") while `##` is a reference to the current space's parent namespace.
*   In [Ada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_(programming_language) "Ada (programming language)"), the `#` character is used in based integer literals, which take the form `base#digits#`, where `base` is an integer from 2 to 16 specifying the radix, and `digits` are the digits valid in that base (0-9, optionally A-F for bases above 10).

*   [Algebraic notation for chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_notation_(chess) "Algebraic notation (chess)"): A hash after a move denotes [checkmate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checkmate "Checkmate").
*   [American Sign Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Sign_Language "American Sign Language") transcription: The hash prefixing an all-caps word identifies a lexicalized fingerspelled sign, having some sort of blends or letter drops. All-caps words without the prefix are used for standard English words that are fingerspelled in their entirety.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign#cite_note-55)
*   [Copy writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy_writer "Copy writer") and [copy editing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy_editing "Copy editing"): Technical writers in [press releases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_release "Press release") often use three number signs, ### directly above the boilerplate or underneath the body copy, indicating to media that there is no further copy to come.[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign#cite_note-56)
*   [Footnote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note_(typography) "Note (typography)") symbols (or endnote symbols): Due to ready availability in many fonts and directly on computer keyboards, "#" and other symbols (such as the [caret](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caret "Caret")) have in recent years begun to be occasionally used in catalogues and reports in place of more traditional symbols (esp. [dagger, double-dagger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagger_(mark) "Dagger (mark)"), [pilcrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilcrow "Pilcrow")).
*   Linguistic [phonology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonology "Phonology"): # denotes a word boundary. For instance, `/d/ → [t] / _#` means that /d/ becomes [t] when it is the last segment in a word (i.e. when it appears before a word boundary).
*   Linguistic [syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax "Syntax"): A hash before an example sentence denotes that the sentence is semantically ill-formed, though grammatically well-formed. For instance, "#The toothbrush is pregnant" is a grammatically correct sentence, but the meaning is odd.[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign#cite_note-57)[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign#cite_note-58)
*   [Medical prescription](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_prescription "Medical prescription") drug delimiter: In some countries, such as [Norway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway "Norway") or [Poland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland "Poland"), # is used as a [delimiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delimiter "Delimiter") between different drugs on medical prescriptions.
*   Medical shorthand: The hash is often used to indicate a [bone fracture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture "Bone fracture").[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign#cite_note-59) For example, "#NOF" is often used for "fractured [neck of femur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur_neck "Femur neck")". In radiotherapy, a full dose of radiation is divided into smaller doses or 'fractions'. These are given the shorthand # to denote either the number of treatments in a prescription (e.g. 60Gy in 30#), or the fraction number (#9 of 25).
*   As a [proofreading mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_proofreader%27s_marks "List of proofreader's marks"), to indicate that a space should be inserted.[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign#cite_note-60)
*   Publishing: When submitting a science fiction manuscript for publication, a number sign on a line by itself (indented or centered) indicates a [section break](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_(typography) "Section (typography)") in the text.[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign#cite_note-61)
*   [Scrabble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrabble "Scrabble"): Putting a number sign after a word indicates that the word is found in the British word lists, but not the [North American lists.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_Tournament_and_Club_Word_List "Official Tournament and Club Word List")[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign#cite_note-62)
*   [Teletext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletext "Teletext") and [DVB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Video_Broadcasting "Digital Video Broadcasting")[subtitles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtitle "Subtitle") (in the UK and Ireland): The hash symbol, resembling music notation's sharp sign, is used to mark text that is either sung by a character or heard in background music, e.g. _#For he's a jolly good fellow#_

The number sign was assigned code 35 (hex 0x23) in ASCII where it was inherited by many character sets. In [EBCDIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBCDIC "EBCDIC") it is often at 0x7B or 0xEC.

Unicode characters with "number sign" in their names:

*   U+0023#NUMBER SIGN (Other [attested names in Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_character_property "Unicode character property") are: POUND SIGN (WEIGHT), HASHTAG, HASH, CROSSHATCH, OCTOTHORPE.[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign#cite_note-63))

Additionally, a Unicode named sequence KEYCAP NUMBER SIGN is defined for the [grapheme cluster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grapheme_cluster "Grapheme cluster")`U+0023+FE0F+20E3` (#️⃣).[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign#cite_note-64)[[b]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign#cite_note-65)

On the standard [US keyboard layout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTY "QWERTY"), the # symbol is ⇧ Shift+3. On standard UK and some other European keyboards, the same keystrokes produce the [pound (sterling) sign, £ symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sign "Pound sign"), and # may be moved to a separate key above the right shift key.
