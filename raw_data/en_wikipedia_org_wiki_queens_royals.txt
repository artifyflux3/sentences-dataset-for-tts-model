On July 1, 2022, the Royals began a four-year transition from NCAA Division II to Division I as new members of the ASUN Conference . Before then, Queens had competed in the South Atlantic Conference (SAC) for 20 of their varsity sports; the men's and women's swimming and diving teams competed in the Bluegrass Mountain Conference and the men's volleyball team competed in the Independent Volleyball Association, a scheduling alliance among schools that are independents in that sport's National Collegiate division.

[ a ] Queens had been a member of the SAC since 2013, when it moved from Conference Carolinas .

On May 7, 2022, Queens announced it had accepted an invitation from the ASUN Conference and would join the league on July 1.

[ 2 ] The ASUN officially announced this move three days later.

[ 3 ] The men's volleyball team joined the Midwestern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association in July 2023 after having played the 2023 season (2022–23 school year) in the Independent Volleyball Association, a loose affiliation of schools not affiliated with an NCAA-recognized men's volleyball conference.
