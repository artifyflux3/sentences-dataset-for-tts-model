[ 1 ] Born in Warsaw , Poland , Guterman attended the University of Warsaw , where he studied psychology. He moved to Paris to study at the Sorbonne , where he continued his studies in psychology, receiving degrees in 1922 and 1923.

[ 2 ] In the 1930s, Guterman worked closely with French Marxist theorist Henri Lefebvre in popularizing the Marxist notions of alienation and mystification . He published translations of Marx's early works, which were often the first publications of these works in any language.

[ 3 ] Guterman, who was Jewish, moved to the United States in 1933, where he took on translation work for the Monthly Review , eventually becoming an editor. He later became interested in Hassidic Judaism , though it is not clear if he became observant or was a hasid of a specific rebbe.

[ 4 ] In 1936 he became an associate member of the Institute for Social Research on the recommendation of Max Horkheimer who held a great deal of respect for him.

[ 2 ] In 1949 he co-published Prophets of Deceit with Leo Löwenthal .

[ 5 ] His papers are kept in the Butler Library of Columbia University .
