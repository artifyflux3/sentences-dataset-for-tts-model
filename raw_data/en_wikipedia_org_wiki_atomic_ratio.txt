Find sources: "Atomic ratio" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( August 2015 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) The atomic ratio is a measure of the ratio of atoms of one kind (i) to another kind (j). A closely related concept is the atomic percent (or at.% ), which gives the percentage of one kind of atom relative to the total number of atoms.

[ 1 ] The molecular equivalents of these concepts are the molar fraction , or molar percent .

Atoms [ edit ] Mathematically, the atomic percent is a t o m i c p e r c e n t ( i ) = N i N t o t × × 100 {\displaystyle \mathrm {atomic\ percent} \ (\mathrm {i} )={\frac {N_{\mathrm {i} }}{N_{\mathrm {tot} }}}\times 100\ } % where N i are the number of atoms of interest and N tot are the total number of atoms, while the atomic ratio is a t o m i c r a t i o ( i : j ) = a t o m i c p e r c e n t ( i ) : a t o m i c p e r c e n t ( j ) .

{\displaystyle \mathrm {atomic\ ratio} \ (\mathrm {i:j} )=\mathrm {atomic\ percent} \ (\mathrm {i} ):\mathrm {atomic\ percent} \ (\mathrm {j} )\ .} For example, the atomic percent of hydrogen in water (H 2 O) is at.% H 2 O = 2/3 x 100 ≈ 66.67% , while the atomic ratio of hydrogen to oxygen is A H:O = 2:1 .

Isotopes [ edit ] Another application is in radiochemistry , where this may refer to isotopic ratios or isotopic abundances . Mathematically, the isotopic abundance is i s o t o p i c a b u n d a n c e ( i ) = N i N t o t , {\displaystyle \mathrm {isotopic\ abundance} \ (\mathrm {i} )={\frac {N_{\mathrm {i} }}{N_{\mathrm {tot} }}}\ ,} where N i are the number of atoms of the isotope of interest and N tot is the total number of atoms, while the atomic ratio is i s o t o p i c r a t i o ( i : j ) = i s o t o p i c p e r c e n t ( i ) : i s o t o p i c p e r c e n t ( j ) .

{\displaystyle \mathrm {isotopic\ ratio} \ (\mathrm {i:j} )=\mathrm {isotopic\ percent} \ (\mathrm {i} ):\mathrm {isotopic\ percent} \ (\mathrm {j} )\ .} For example, the isotopic ratio of deuterium (D) to hydrogen (H) in heavy water is roughly D:H = 1:7000 (corresponding to an isotopic abundance of 0.00014%).

Doping in laser physics [ edit ] In laser physics however, the atomic ratio may refer to the doping ratio or the doping fraction .

For example, theoretically, a 100% doping ratio of Yb : Y 3 Al 5 O 12 is pure Yb 3 Al 5 O 12 .

The doping fraction equals, N a t o m s o f d o p a n t N a t o m s o f s o l u t i o n w h i c h c a n b e s u b s t i t u t e d w i t h t h e d o p a n t {\displaystyle \mathrm {\frac {N_{\mathrm {atoms\ of\ dopant} }}{N_{\mathrm {atoms\ of\ solution\ which\ can\ be\ substituted\ with\ the\ dopant} }}} } See also [ edit ] Table of concentration measures References [ edit ] ^ McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Chemistry .
