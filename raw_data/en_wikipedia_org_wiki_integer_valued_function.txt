In other words, it is a function that assigns an integer to each member of its domain .

The floor and ceiling functions are examples of integer-valued functions of a real variable , but on real numbers and, generally, on (non-disconnected) topological spaces integer-valued functions are not especially useful. Any such function on a connected space either has discontinuities or is constant . On the other hand, on discrete and other totally disconnected spaces integer-valued functions have roughly the same importance as real-valued functions have on non-discrete spaces.

Any function with natural , or non-negative integer values is a partial case of an integer-valued function.

Examples [ edit ] Integer-valued functions defined on the domain of all real numbers include the floor and ceiling functions, the Dirichlet function , the sign function and the Heaviside step function (except possibly at 0).

Integer-valued functions defined on the domain of non-negative real numbers include the integer square root function and the prime-counting function .

Algebraic properties [ edit ] On an arbitrary set X , integer-valued functions form a ring with pointwise operations of addition and multiplication, [ 1 ] and also an algebra over the ring Z of integers. Since the latter is an ordered ring , the functions form a partially ordered ring : f ‚â§ ‚â§ g ‚ü∫ ‚ü∫ ‚àÄ ‚àÄ x : f ( x ) ‚â§ ‚â§ g ( x ) .

{\displaystyle f\leq g\quad \iff \quad \forall x:f(x)\leq g(x).} Uses [ edit ] Graph theory and algebra [ edit ] Integer-valued functions are ubiquitous in graph theory . They also have similar uses in geometric group theory , where length function represents the concept of norm , and word metric represents the concept of metric .

Integer-valued polynomials are important in ring theory .

Mathematical logic and computability theory [ edit ] In mathematical logic , such concepts as primitive recursive functions and Œº-recursive functions represent integer-valued functions of several natural variables or, in other words, functions on N n .

G√∂del numbering , defined on well-formed formulae of some formal language , is a natural-valued function.

Computability theory is essentially based on natural numbers and natural (or integer) functions on them.

Number theory [ edit ] In number theory , many arithmetic functions are integer-valued.

Computer science [ edit ] In computer programming , many functions return values of integer type due to simplicity of implementation.
