Find sources: "Industrial mineral" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( November 2023 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Industrial resources ( minerals ) are geological materials that are mined for their commercial value, which are not fuel ( fuel minerals or mineral fuels ) and are not sources of metals ( metallic minerals) but are used in the industries based on their physical and/or chemical properties.

[ 1 ] They are used in their natural state or after beneficiation either as raw materials or as additives in a wide range of applications.

Examples and applications [ edit ] Typical examples of industrial rocks and minerals are limestone , clays , sand , gravel , diatomite , kaolin , bentonite , silica , barite , gypsum , and talc .
Some examples of applications for industrial minerals are construction , ceramics , paints , electronics , filtration , plastics , glass , detergents and paper .

In some cases, even organic materials ( peat ) and industrial products or by-products ( cement , slag , silica fume ) are categorized under industrial minerals, as well as metallic compounds mainly utilized in non-metallic form (as an example most titanium is utilized as an oxide TiO 2 rather than Ti metal).

The evaluation of raw materials to determine their suitability for use as industrial minerals requires technical test-work, mineral processing trials and end-product evaluation; free to download evaluation manuals are available for the following industrial minerals: limestone, flake graphite , diatomite , kaolin , bentonite and construction materials. These are available from the British Geological Survey external link 'Industrial Minerals in BGS' with regular industry news and reports published in Industrial Minerals magazine .
