As a fortified city , it was of strategic military and political significance. Although a direct fiefdom of the Holy Roman Emperor , the city obtained a municipal charter ; the acquisition of Breda, through marriage, by the House of Nassau ensured that Breda would be at the center of political and social life in the Low Countries . Breda had a population of 184,126 in 2021; the metropolitan area had a population of 324,812.

The first mention of Breda in the historical record was in 1125 by Engelbertus van Breda who was a witness to draw up of a document.

[ 8 ] The city of Breda obtained a municipal charter in 1252. After that Breda had the rights to build fortifications. The city constructed brick walls and Roman-style gates.

In 1327, Adelheid of Gaveren sold Breda to Duke Johannes III of Brabant . In 1350, the fief was resold to Johannes II of Wassenaar (d. 1377). In 1403, the heiress of his line, Johanna of Polanen (1392–1445), married Engelbert I of Nassau (1370–1442; his sarcophagus is in the Grote Kerk in Breda). Through her, the city came into the possession of the House of Nassau , where it remained until 1795, passing to William I of Orange (1533–1584), stadtholder of Holland , Zeeland , and Utrecht and leader of the Dutch revolt . Thus, the baron of Breda was also Count of Nassau in the Holy Roman Empire , Prince of Orange , and (the main) stadtholder in the Dutch Republic (from 1572 to 1650, 1672–1702, 1747–1795). Breda remained part of the barony of Breda until it was captured by French revolutionary forces in 1795.

[ 9 ] Residence city [ edit ] Haultpenne's soldiers vent their fury upon the citizens of Breda in 1581 The Surrender of Breda , by Diego Velázquez .

The acquisition of the city by the House of Orange-Nassau marked its emergence as a residentiestad (residence city). The presence of the Orange-Nassau family attracted other nobles, who built palatial residences in the old quarters of the city. The most impressive one, built by the Italian architect Thomas Vincidor de Bologna for the first Dutch prince, was the first renaissance-style palace built north of the Alps. In the 15th century the city's physical, economic and strategic importance expanded rapidly. A great church was built in Brabantine Gothic style with an elegant 97-metre-high (318 ft) tower, called Grote Kerk (main church) or also Onze Lieve Vrouwe Kerk (Church of Our Lady). In 1534 Henry III of Nassau-Breda rebuilt the modest medieval fortifications in impressive style.

In 1534, a fire destroyed over nine tenths of the city, close to 1300 houses, churches, and chapels, and the town hall. Only 150 houses and the main church remained. In July 1581, during the Eighty Years' War , Breda was captured in a surprise attack and siege by Spanish troops then under the command of Claudius van Barlaymont , whose sobriquet was Haultpenne. Although the city had surrendered upon the condition that it would not be plundered, the troops vented their fury upon the inhabitants. In the resulting mayhem, known as Haultpenne's Fury , over 500 citizens were killed. In March 1590, Breda fell back into the hands of the Dutch and Maurice of Nassau , when a 68 men hand-picked force, concealed under the turf of a peat-boat, had contrived to enter the city in a daring plan devised by Adriaen van Bergen , known as the ruse with the Peat Ship of Breda . Around 1610 the construction of the Spanish Gate or "Spanjaardsgat" was started as a remembrance to that successful action.

[ 10 ] After a ten-month siege in 1624–25 , the city again surrendered to the Spaniards, now led by Spinola ; the event was immortalized by Diego Velázquez . In the Siege of Breda of 1637 the city was recaptured by Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange , after a four-month siege, and in 1648 it was finally ceded to the Dutch Republic by the Treaty of Westphalia .

In 1646, Frederick Henry founded the Orange College of Breda , modelled on Saumur , Geneva , and Oxford , intending it to train young men of good family for the army and the civil service.

[ 11 ] Stuart exiles [ edit ] The exiled Stuart Charles II of England resided in Breda for a little over a month of his time in exile during the Cromwellian Commonwealth and Protectorate , thanks to the proximity of Charles's sister Mary, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange , the widow of Prince William II of Orange (died 1702).

Based mostly on suggestions by the Parliamentarian General George Monck , Charles II's Declaration of Breda (1660) announced his conditions for accepting the crown of England, which he was to regain a few months later in the year.

Later history [ edit ] Polish soldiers welcomed by the residents of Breda, 1944 The Treaty of Breda was signed in the city on 31 July 1667, bringing to an end the Second Anglo-Dutch War in which the Dutch faced the same Charles II who had been their guest. Between 1746 and 1748 it was the site of the Congress of Breda , a series of talks between Britain and France aimed at bringing an end to the War of the Austrian Succession , which ultimately led to the signing of the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle .

During the Second World War , the city was under German occupation for over four years. During Operation Pheasant Breda was liberated following a successful outflanking manoeuvre planned and performed by forces of 1st Polish Armoured Division of General Maczek on 28 October 1944. Each year during Liberation Day festivities, Breda is visited by a large Polish contingent and the city of Breda reserves a special portion of the festivities for the fallen Polish soldiers. A museum and a monument honoring Maczek and the Polish 1st Armoured Division stands in the city center. General Maczek and many soldiers of his division are buried in the nearby Polish military cemetery.

Breda, Polish chapel Breda was the site of one of the first panopticon prison establishments, Koepelgevangenis . This prison housed the only German war criminals ever to be imprisoned in the Netherlands for their war crimes during the Second World War. Known as " The Breda Four ", or "Vier von Breda", they were Willy Paul Franz Lages , who was released in 1966 due to serious illness, Joseph Johann Kotalla , who died in prison in 1979, and Ferdinand aus der Fünten and Franz Fischer, who were both released in 1989 and died later the same year.

[ 26 ] The international train from Amsterdam to Brussels-South railway station also stops in Breda and connects the city with these destinations via the Schiphol–Antwerp high-speed railway. The train is operated by a corporation between NS International and the National Railway Company of Belgium (NMBS).

[ 27 ] [ 28 ] Buses [ edit ] There are four kinds of buses in Breda: citybuses, regional, intercity and international. City and regional buses are operated by Arriva under the alias 'Bravo' ( BRA bant V ervoert O ns ).

These lines are a compensation for the lack of direct train connection between the cities.

There was also a Zeelanddic busline (19) which connected Hulst ( Zeelandic Flanders ) and Breda via Antwerp , Belgium . The line was operated by Connexxion and in the past by the Belgian De Lijn . After 71 years the line was canceled in 2024.

Low-cost intercity bus service FlixBus provides a regular timetable to Bercy, Seine via Antwerp or Gent-Dampoort . In addition, two routes to the Romanian capital Bucharest . Either via Antwerp – Maastricht – Aachen or via Eindhoven – Düsseldorf to Cologne/Bonn Airport station – Frankfurt am Main Hbf to Passau , with the final station Autogara Militari.

Waterway [ edit ] The city owes its existence to the accessibility by water. As from the beginning of the city, the rivers Mark and Aa were used for trading and supplying the city. Today the city is accessible for pleasure boating from the north. There is an open connection to the Volkerak via the Mark and connection to the Wilhelmina Canal through the Mark Canal. The Dintel/Mark is accessible for cargo ships up to 86 meters (282 ft) long from Dintelsas to Breda.  The 'Werve' yacht port provides a berth for passing pleasure ships just north of the city center.
