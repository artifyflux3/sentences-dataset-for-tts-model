[ 1 ] This distribution is related to the uniform , the triangular , and the normal Gaussian distribution , and has applications in broadcast engineering for signal enhancement.

The Bates distribution on [ 0 , 1 ] {\displaystyle [0,1]} and of parameter n {\displaystyle n} is sometimes confused [ 2 ] with the Irwin–Hall distribution of parameter n {\displaystyle n} , which is the distribution of the sum (not the mean ) of n {\displaystyle n} independent random variables uniformly distributed on the unit interval [ 0 , 1 ] {\displaystyle [0,1]} . More precisely, if X {\displaystyle X} has a Bates distribution on [ 0 , 1 ] {\displaystyle [0,1]} , then n X {\displaystyle nX} has an Irwin-Hall distribution of parameter n {\displaystyle n} (and support on [ 0 , n ] {\displaystyle [0,n]} ). For n = 1 {\displaystyle n=1} , both the Bates distribution and the Irwin-Hall distribution coincide  with the uniform distribution on the unit interval [ 0 , 1 ] {\displaystyle [0,1]} .

Definition [ edit ] The Bates distribution on the unit interval [ 0 , 1 ] {\displaystyle [0,1]} and with parameter n ∈ ∈ N {\displaystyle n\in \mathbb {N} } is the continuous probability distribution of the empirical mean X {\displaystyle X} of n {\displaystyle n} independent random variables U 1 , .

Here sgn ⁡ ⁡ ( n x − − k ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {sgn}(nx-k)} denotes the sign function : sgn ⁡ ⁡ ( n x − − k ) = { − − 1 n x < k 0 n x = k 1 n x > k .

Extensions and Applications [ edit ] This section needs expansion . You can help by adding to it .

( February 2020 ) With a few modifications, the Bates distribution encompasses the uniform , the triangular , and, taking the limit as n goes to infinity, also the normal Gaussian distribution .

[ citation needed ] Replacing the term 1 n {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{n}}} when calculating the mean, X , with 1 n {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{\sqrt {n}}}} will create a similar distribution with a constant variance, such as unity. Then, by subtracting the mean, the resulting mean of the distribution will be set at zero. Thus the parameter n would become a purely shape-adjusting parameter . By also allowing n to be a non-integer, a highly flexible distribution can be created, for example, U (0,1) + 0.5 U (0,1) gives a trapezoidal distribution .

[ citation needed ] The Student-t distribution provides a natural extension of the normal Gaussian distribution for modeling of long tail data. A Bates distribution that has been generalized as previously stated fulfills the same purpose for short tail data.

[ citation needed ] The Bates distribution has an application to beamforming and pattern synthesis in the field of electrical engineering . The distribution was found to increase the beamwidth of the main lobe , representing an increase in the signal of the radiation pattern in a single direction, while simultaneously reducing the usually undesirable [ 3 ] sidelobe levels.
