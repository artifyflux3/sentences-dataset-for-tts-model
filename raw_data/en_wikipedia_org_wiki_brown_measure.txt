( October 2019 ) In mathematics , the Brown measure of an operator in a finite factor is a probability measure on the complex plane which may be viewed as an analog of the spectral counting measure (based on algebraic multiplicity ) of matrices.

It is named after Lawrence G. Brown .

Definition [ edit ] Let M {\displaystyle {\mathcal {M}}} be a finite factor with the canonical normalized trace τ τ {\displaystyle \tau } and let I {\displaystyle I} be the identity operator. For every operator A ∈ ∈ M , {\displaystyle A\in {\mathcal {M}},} the function λ λ ↦ ↦ τ τ ( log ⁡ ⁡ | A − − λ λ I | ) , λ λ ∈ ∈ C , {\displaystyle \lambda \mapsto \tau (\log \left|A-\lambda I\right|),\;\lambda \in \mathbb {C} ,} is a subharmonic function and its Laplacian in the distributional sense is a probability measure on C {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} } μ μ A ( d ( a + b i ) ) := 1 2 π π ∇ ∇ 2 τ τ ( log ⁡ ⁡ | A − − ( a + b i ) I | ) d a d b {\displaystyle \mu _{A}(\mathrm {d} (a+b\mathbb {i} )):={\frac {1}{2\pi }}\nabla ^{2}\tau (\log \left|A-(a+b\mathbb {i} )I\right|)\mathrm {d} a\mathrm {d} b} which is called the Brown measure of A .

{\displaystyle A.} Here the Laplace operator ∇ ∇ 2 {\displaystyle \nabla ^{2}} is complex.

The subharmonic function can also be written in terms of the Fuglede−Kadison determinant Δ Δ F K {\displaystyle \Delta _{FK}} as follows λ λ ↦ ↦ log ⁡ ⁡ Δ Δ F K ( A − − λ λ I ) , λ λ ∈ ∈ C .

{\displaystyle \lambda \mapsto \log \Delta _{FK}(A-\lambda I),\;\lambda \in \mathbb {C} .} See also [ edit ] Direct integral – Generalization of the concept of direct sum in mathematics References [ edit ] Brown, Lawrence (1986), "Lidskii's theorem in the type I I {\displaystyle II} case", Pitman Res.
