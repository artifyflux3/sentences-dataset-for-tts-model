It is bounded by Massachusetts Avenue, the Charles River , the Grand Junction Railroad , and River Street.

[ 1 ] The neighborhood contains predominantly residential homes, many of the triple decker style common in New England.

Central Square , at the northernmost part of Cambridgeport, is an active commercial district and transportation hub, and University Park is a collection of renovated or recently constructed office and apartment buildings. The neighborhood also includes Fort Washington Park , several MIT buildings, and Magazine Beach .

The neighborhood is Area 5 of Cambridge.

[ 1 ] History [ edit ] Once part of a more expansive marshland area associated with the Charles River basin, today many of the area's names are associated with its early history.

[ 2 ] Over time the area has become a center of municipal government for the city.

The Fig Newton cookie (named after nearby Newton, Massachusetts ) was first manufactured in Cambridgeport in 1891 at the F. A. Kennedy Steam Bakery .

Portions of the neighborhood would have been demolished as part of the Inner Belt highway project first planned in 1948 [ 3 ] but canceled in 1971 after intense protests organized by community activists, and following Gov.

Francis Sargent 's 1970 moratorium on highway construction inside Route 128 . The original plan called for the Interstate to parallel Brookline Street to the Boston University Bridge , [ 4 ] although at least one other alignment was also considered.

[ 5 ] Demographics [ edit ] In 2010 the neighborhood had a population of 12,220 residents living in 5,391 households.

[ 6 ] In 1999, the median household income was $45,294, which has since risen to $86,800 in 2020.

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] Education [ edit ] Cambridge Public Schools operates Cambridgeport School, [ 9 ] which covers elementary school grades.

[ 10 ] The school opened in 1990.

[ 11 ] In 1997 Mary Lou McGrath, the superintendent, proposed closing Cambridgeport School.

[ 12 ] The school stayed open, and since circa 2001 it occupies the ex-Fletcher School.
