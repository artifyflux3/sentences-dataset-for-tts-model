The galactic plane is the plane on which most of a disk-shaped galaxy 's mass lies. The directions perpendicular to the galactic plane point to the galactic poles . In actual usage, the terms galactic plane and galactic poles usually refer specifically to the plane and poles of the Milky Way , in which Planet Earth is located.

Some galaxies are irregular and do not have any well-defined disk. Even in the case of a barred spiral galaxy like the Milky Way, defining the galactic plane is slightly imprecise and arbitrary since the stars are not perfectly coplanar . In 1959, the IAU defined the position of the Milky Way's north galactic pole as exactly RA = 12 h 49 m , Dec = 27° 24′ in the then-used B1950 epoch ; [ citation needed ] in the currently-used J2000 epoch, after precession is taken into account, its position is RA 12 h 51 m 26.282 s , Dec 27° 07′ 42.01″.

[ citation needed ] This position is in Coma Berenices , near the bright star Arcturus ; likewise, the south galactic pole lies in the constellation Sculptor .

The zero of longitude of galactic coordinates was also defined in 1959 to be at position angle 123° from the north celestial pole . Thus the zero longitude point on the galactic equator was at 17 h 42 m 26.603 s , −28° 55′ 00.445″ (B1950) or 17 h 45 m 37.224 s , −28° 56′ 10.23″ (J2000), and its J2000 position angle is 122.932°. The Galactic Center is located at position angle 31.72° (B1950) or 31.40° (J2000) east of north.

This edge-on view of the galaxy NGC 4452 from Earth shows its galactic plane, with the nucleus at the center.

This edge-on view of the spiral galaxy NGC 891 shows the profile of a dusty galactic plane.
