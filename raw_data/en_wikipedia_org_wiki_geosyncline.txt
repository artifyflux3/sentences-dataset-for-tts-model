This is the "collapse" of the geosyncline.

A geosyncline (originally called a geosynclinal ) is an obsolete geological concept to explain orogens , which was developed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, before the theory of plate tectonics was envisaged.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] A geosyncline was described as a giant downward fold in the Earth's crust , with associated upward folds called geanticlines (or geanticlinals ), that preceded the climax phase of orogenic deformation .

[ 1 ] History [ edit ] The geosyncline concept was first conceived by the American geologists James Hall and James Dwight Dana in the mid-19th century, during the classic studies of the Appalachian Mountains .

[ 1 ] [ 3 ] Émile Haug further developed the geosyncline concept, and introduced it to Europe in 1900.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] Eduard Suess, a leading geologist of his time, disapproved the concept of geosyncline, and in 1909 he argued against its use due to its association with outdated theories.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] This did not prevent further development of the concept in the first half of the 20th century by Leopold Kober and Hans Stille , both of whom worked on a contracting Earth framework.

[ 7 ] The continued development of the geosyncline theory by Stille and Kober following the publication of Eduard Suess ' Das Antlitz der Erde from 1885 to 1909 was not unchallenged, as another school of thought was led by Alfred Wegener and Émile Argand .

[ 7 ] This competing view rejected the premise of planetary contraction, and argued that orogeny was the result of continental drift .

[ 8 ] These two views can be called "fixist", in the case of geosyncline theory, and "mobilist" for the support of continental drift.

[ 9 ] Even as continental drift became generally accepted, the concept of geosynclines persisted in geological science.  In 1970, John F. Dewey and John M. Bird adapted the geosyncline to plate tectonics.

[ 10 ] The term continued to have usage within a plate tectonics framework in the 1980s, although as early as 1982, Celâl Şengör argued against its use, in light of its association with discredited geological ideas.

[ 6 ] [ 11 ] Geosynclinal theory [ edit ] Dana and Stille supposed that the collapse of geosynclines into orogens was result of the Earth's contraction over time.

[ 5 ] In Stille and Kober's view, geosynclines and orogens were the unstable parts of the Earth's crust, in stark contrast with the very stable kratogens .

[ 12 ] [ 13 ] Stille theorized that the contractional forces responsible for geosynclines also formed epeirogenic uplifts , resulting in a pattern of undulation in the Earth's crust.  According to this view, regular, episodic global revolutions caused geosynclines to collapse, forming orogens.

[ 13 ] According to Kober and Stille, developing geosynclinal depressions were accompanied by uplifted geanticlines, which then eroded , providing sediments that filled the geosynclinal basin .

[ 1 ] According to Stille, geosynclines were formed from crustal folding rather than faulting ; if faults were present in geosynclines, they were the product of later processes, such as the final collapse of the geosyncline.

[ 4 ] Gustav Steinmann interpreted ophiolites using the geosyncline concept.  He theorized that the apparent lack of ophiolite in the Peruvian Andes was indebted either to the Andes being preceded by a shallow geosyncline, or because the Andes represented just the margin of a geosyncline.

[ 14 ] Steinmann contributed this correlation to the distinction between Cordilleran and Alpine-type mountains.

[ 14 ] According to Stille, a type of geosyncline called a "eugeosyncline" was characterized by producing an "initial magmatism", which in some cases corresponded to ophiolitic magmatism .

[ 14 ] With respect to oceanic basins, Kober held them to be separate and distinct from geosynclines.

[ 15 ] He nonetheless believed that mid-ocean ridges were orogens, although Stille disagreed, asserting that they were places of extensional tectonics , as exemplified by Iceland .

[ 12 ] Meanwhile, Argand argued that geosynclines, sufficiently attenuated through stretching, could become oceans basins, as a material called " sima " surfaced.
