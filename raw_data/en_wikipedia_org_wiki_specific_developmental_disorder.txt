[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Specific developmental disorders were contrasted to pervasive developmental disorders [ 4 ] which were characterized by delays in the development of multiple basic functions including socialization and communication .

[ 5 ] ICD-10 taxonomy [ edit ] The tenth revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) has four categories of  developmental disorders: specific developmental disorders of speech and language, specific developmental disorders of scholastic skills, specific developmental disorder of motor function, and mixed specific developmental disorder.

[ 2 ] [ 6 ] DSM-III taxonomy [ edit ] In the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III), [ 7 ] SDD was opposed to the pervasive developmental disorders (PDD). There were two factors that were considered: The specificity of the impairment: in SDD there is one single domain that is affected, whereas in PDD multiple areas of functioning are affected.

[ 8 ] The nature of the impairment: development in SDD is delayed but not otherwise abnormal, whereas in PDD there are behavioral deviations that are not typical for any developmental stage.

[ 8 ] In the DSM-IV, specific developmental disorders were no longer grouped together.

[ 9 ] Instead they were reclassified as communication disorders, learning disorders, and motor skills disorders.
