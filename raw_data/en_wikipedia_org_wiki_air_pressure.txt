**Atmospheric pressure**, also known as **air pressure** or **barometric pressure** (after the [barometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barometer "Barometer")), is the [pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure "Pressure") within the [atmosphere of Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth "Atmosphere of Earth"). The [standard atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_atmosphere_(unit) "Standard atmosphere (unit)") (symbol: atm) is a unit of pressure defined as 101,325[Pa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(unit) "Pascal (unit)") (1,013.25[hPa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(unit) "Pascal (unit)")), which is equivalent to 1,013.25 [millibars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_(unit) "Bar (unit)"),[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pressure#cite_note-1) 760[mm Hg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre_of_mercury "Millimetre of mercury"), 29.9212[inches Hg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inch_of_mercury "Inch of mercury"), or 14.696[psi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pounds_per_square_inch "Pounds per square inch").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pressure#cite_note-ICAO-2) The atm unit is roughly equivalent to the [mean sea-level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_sea-level "Mean sea-level") atmospheric pressure on Earth; that is, the Earth's atmospheric pressure at sea level is approximately 1 atm.

In most circumstances, atmospheric pressure is closely approximated by the [hydrostatic pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_pressure "Fluid pressure") caused by the [weight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight "Weight") of [air](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_atmosphere "Earth's atmosphere") above the measurement point. As [elevation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevation "Elevation") increases, there is less overlying atmospheric mass, so atmospheric pressure decreases with increasing elevation. Because the atmosphere is thin relative to the Earth's radius—especially the dense atmospheric layer at low altitudes—the Earth's [gravitational acceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_acceleration "Gravitational acceleration") as a function of altitude can be approximated as constant and contributes little to this fall-off. Pressure measures force per unit area, with [SI units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units "International System of Units") of [pascals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(unit) "Pascal (unit)") (1 pascal = 1 [newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_(unit) "Newton (unit)") per square [metre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre "Metre"), 1 N/m 2). On average, a column of air with a cross-sectional area of 1 square [centimetre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre "Centimetre") (cm 2), measured from the mean (average) sea level to the top of Earth's atmosphere, has a [mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass "Mass") of about 1.03 [kilogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram "Kilogram") and exerts a [force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force "Force") or "weight" of about 10.1 [newtons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newtons "Newtons"), resulting in a pressure of 10.1 N/cm 2 or 101[kN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_(unit)#Kilonewtons "Newton (unit)")/m 2 (101 kilopascals, kPa). A column of air with a cross-sectional area of 1 in 2 would have a weight of about 14.7[lbf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_(force) "Pound (force)"), resulting in a pressure of 14.7 lbf/in 2.

Atmospheric pressure is caused by the gravitational attraction of the planet on the atmospheric gases above the surface and is a function of the mass of the planet, the radius of the surface, and the amount and composition of the gases and their vertical distribution in the atmosphere.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pressure#cite_note-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pressure#cite_note-4) It is modified by the planetary rotation and local effects such as wind velocity, density variations due to temperature and variations in composition.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pressure#cite_note-5)

Kollsman-type barometric aircraft [altimeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altimeter "Altimeter").

The _mean sea-level pressure_ (MSLP) is the atmospheric pressure at [mean sea level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_sea_level "Mean sea level"). This is the atmospheric pressure normally given in weather reports via meteorologists on radio, television, and newspapers or on the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet "Internet").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pressure#cite_note-6)

The _[altimeter setting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altimeter\_setting "Altimeter setting")_ in aviation is an atmospheric pressure adjustment.

Average _sea-level pressure_ is 1,013.25 hPa (29.921 inHg; 760.00 mmHg). In aviation weather reports ([METAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/METAR "METAR")), [QNH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QNH "QNH") is transmitted around the world in hectopascals or millibars (1 hectopascal = 1 millibar). In the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States"), [Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada "Canada"), and [Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan "Japan") altimeter setting is reported in [inches of mercury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inches_of_mercury "Inches of mercury") (to two decimal places). The United States and Canada also report _sea-level pressure_ SLP, which is adjusted to sea level by a different method, in the remarks section, not in the internationally transmitted part of the code, in hectopascals or millibars.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pressure#cite_note-7) However, in Canada's public weather reports, sea level pressure is instead reported in kilopascals.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pressure#cite_note-8)

In the US weather code remarks, three digits are all that are transmitted; decimal points and the one or two most significant digits are omitted: 1,013.2 hPa (14.695 psi) is transmitted as 132; 1,000 hPa (100 kPa) is transmitted as 000; 998.7 hPa is transmitted as 987; etc. The highest _sea-level pressure_ on Earth occurs in [Siberia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberia "Siberia"), where the [Siberian High](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberian_High "Siberian High") often attains a _sea-level pressure_ above 1,050 hPa (15.2 psi; 31 inHg), with record highs close to 1,085 hPa (15.74 psi; 32.0 inHg). The lowest measurable _sea-level pressure_ is found at the centres of [tropical cyclones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone "Tropical cyclone") and [tornadoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado "Tornado"), with a [record low](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pressure#Records) of 870 hPa (12.6 psi; 26 inHg). A system transmitting the last three digits transmits the same code (800) for 1080.0 hPa as for 980.0 hPa.

_Surface pressure_ is the atmospheric pressure at a location on [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth")'s surface ([terrain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrain "Terrain") and [oceans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceans "Oceans")). It is directly proportional to the [mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass "Mass") of air over that location.

For numerical reasons, atmospheric models such as [general circulation models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_circulation_model "General circulation model") (GCMs) usually predict the nondimensional _[logarithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm "Logarithm") of surface pressure_.

The average value of surface pressure on Earth is 985 hPa.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pressure#cite_note-jacobs-9) This is in contrast to mean sea-level pressure, which involves the extrapolation of pressure to sea level for locations above or below sea level. The average pressure at mean sea level ([MSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_Level "Sea Level")) in the International Standard Atmosphere ([ISA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Standard_Atmosphere "International Standard Atmosphere")) is 1,013.25 hPa, or 1 atmosphere (atm), or 29.92 inches of mercury.

Pressure (P), mass (m), and acceleration due to gravity (g) are related by P = F/A = (m*g)/A, where A is the surface area. Atmospheric pressure is thus proportional to the weight per unit area of the atmospheric mass above that location.

This plastic bottle was sealed at approximately 4,300 metres (14,000 ft) altitude, and was crushed by the increase in atmospheric pressure, recorded at 2,700 metres (9,000 ft) and 300 metres (1,000 ft), as it was brought down towards sea level.

Pressure on Earth varies with the altitude of the surface, so air pressure on mountains is usually lower than air pressure at sea level. Pressure varies smoothly from the Earth's surface to the top of the [mesosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesosphere "Mesosphere"). Although the pressure changes with the weather, NASA has averaged the conditions for all parts of the earth year-round. As altitude increases, atmospheric pressure decreases. One can calculate the atmospheric pressure at a given altitude.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pressure#cite_note-10) Temperature and humidity also affect the atmospheric pressure. Pressure is proportional to temperature and inversely related to humidity, and both of these are necessary to compute an accurate figure. The graph on the right above was developed for a temperature of 15°C and a relative humidity of 0%.

At low altitudes above sea level, the pressure decreases by about 1.2 kPa (12 hPa) for every 100 metres. For higher altitudes within the [troposphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troposphere "Troposphere"), the following equation (the [barometric formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barometric_formula "Barometric formula")) relates atmospheric pressure _p_ to altitude _h_:

![Image 7: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}p&=p_{0}\cdot \left(1+{\frac {L\cdot h}{T_{0}}}\right)^{-{\frac {g\cdot M}{R_{0}\cdot L}}}\\&=p_{0}\cdot \left(1+{\frac {g\cdot h}{c_{\text{p}}\cdot T_{0}}}\right)^{-{\frac {c_{\text{p}}\cdot M}{R_{0}}}}\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5eb4868a3908de001d4678f42a96d125242969b4)

The values in these equations are:

| Parameter | Description | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| _h_ | Height above mean sea level | m |
| _p_ 0 | Sea level standard atmospheric pressure | 101,325 Pa |

[Hurricane Wilma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Wilma "Hurricane Wilma") on 19 October 2005. The pressure in the eye of the storm was 882 hPa (12.79 psi) at the time the image was taken.

Atmospheric pressure varies widely on Earth, and these changes are important in studying [weather](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather "Weather") and [climate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate "Climate"). Atmospheric pressure shows a diurnal or semidiurnal (twice-daily) cycle caused by global [atmospheric tides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_tides "Atmospheric tides"). This effect is strongest in tropical zones, with an amplitude of a few hectopascals, and almost zero in polar areas. These variations have two superimposed cycles, a circadian (24 h) cycle, and a semi-circadian (12 h) cycle.

The highest adjusted-to-sea level barometric pressure ever recorded on Earth (above 750 meters) was 1,084.8 hPa (32.03 inHg) measured in [Tosontsengel, Mongolia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tosontsengel,_Zavkhan "Tosontsengel, Zavkhan") on 19 December 2001.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pressure#cite_note-wmo.ASU.edu-11) The highest adjusted-to-sea level barometric pressure ever recorded (below 750 meters) was at Agata in [Evenk Autonomous Okrug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evenk_Autonomous_Okrug "Evenk Autonomous Okrug"), Russia (66°53'N, 93°28'E, elevation: 261 m, 856 ft) on 31 December 1968 of 1,083.8 hPa (32.005 inHg).[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pressure#cite_note-12) The discrimination is due to the problematic assumptions (assuming a standard lapse rate) associated with reduction of sea level from high elevations.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pressure#cite_note-wmo.ASU.edu-11)

The [Dead Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Sea "Dead Sea"), the lowest place on Earth at 430 metres (1,410 ft) below sea level, has a correspondingly high typical atmospheric pressure of 1,065 hPa.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pressure#cite_note-13) A below-sea-level surface pressure record of 1,081.8 hPa (31.95 inHg) was set on 21 February 1961.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pressure#cite_note-14)

The lowest non-tornadic atmospheric pressure ever measured was 870 hPa (0.858 atm; 25.69 inHg), set on 12 October 1979, during [Typhoon Tip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoon_Tip "Typhoon Tip") in the western Pacific Ocean. The measurement was based on an instrumental observation made from a reconnaissance aircraft.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pressure#cite_note-FAQ1-15)

Measurement based on the depth of water
---------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Atmospheric_pressure&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Measurement based on the depth of water")]

One [atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_(unit) "Atmosphere (unit)") (101.325 kPa or 14.7 psi) is also the pressure caused by the weight of a column of freshwater of approximately 10.3 m (33.8 ft). Thus, a diver 10.3 m under water experiences a pressure of about 2 atmospheres (1 atm of air plus 1 atm of water). Conversely, 10.3 m is the maximum height to which water can be raised using [suction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suction "Suction") under standard atmospheric conditions.

Low pressures, such as [natural gas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_gas "Natural gas") lines, are sometimes specified in [inches of water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inch_of_water "Inch of water"), typically written as _w.c._ (water column) gauge or _w.g._ (inches water) gauge. A typical gas-using residential appliance in the US is rated for a maximum of 1⁄2 psi (3.4 kPa; 34 mbar), which is approximately 14 w.g. Similar metric units with a wide variety of names and notation based on [millimetres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimeters,_water_gauge "Millimeters, water gauge"), [centimetres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre_of_water "Centimetre of water") or metres are now less commonly used.

Boiling point of liquids
------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Atmospheric_pressure&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Boiling point of liquids")]

[![Image 9](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Kochendes_wasser02.jpg/250px-Kochendes_wasser02.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Kochendes_wasser02.jpg)

[Boiling water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_water "Boiling water")

Pure water [boils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling "Boiling") at 100°C (212°F) at earth's standard atmospheric pressure. The boiling point is the temperature at which the [vapour pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vapour_pressure "Vapour pressure") is equal to the atmospheric pressure around the liquid.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pressure#cite_note-16) Because of this, the boiling point of liquids is lower at lower pressure and higher at higher pressure. Cooking at high elevations, therefore, requires adjustments to recipes[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pressure#cite_note-17) or [pressure cooking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure_cooking "Pressure cooking"). A rough approximation of elevation can be obtained by measuring the temperature at which water boils; in the mid-19th century, this method was used by explorers.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pressure#cite_note-18) Conversely, if one wishes to evaporate a liquid at a lower temperature, for example in [distillation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distillation "Distillation"), the atmospheric pressure may be lowered by using a [vacuum pump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_pump "Vacuum pump"), as in a [rotary evaporator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_evaporator "Rotary evaporator").

Measurement and maps
--------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Atmospheric_pressure&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Measurement and maps")]

An important application of the knowledge that atmospheric pressure varies directly with altitude was in determining the height of hills and mountains, thanks to reliable pressure measurement devices. In 1774, [Nevil Maskelyne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevil_Maskelyne "Nevil Maskelyne") was confirming Newton's theory of gravitation at and on [Schiehallion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schiehallion "Schiehallion") mountain in Scotland, and he needed to measure elevations on the mountain's sides accurately. This event is known as the [Schiehallion experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schiehallion_experiment "Schiehallion experiment"). [William Roy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Roy "William Roy"), using barometric pressure, was able to confirm Maskelyne's height determinations; the agreement was within one meter (3.28 feet). This method became and continues to be useful for survey work and map making.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pressure#cite_note-19)
