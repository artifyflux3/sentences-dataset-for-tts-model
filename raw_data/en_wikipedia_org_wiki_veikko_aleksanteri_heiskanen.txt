A. Heiskanen ; also spelled Weikko Aleksanteri (or W. A.

) Heiskanen ; 23 July 1895 – 23 October 1971) was a Finnish geodesist and geophysicist .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] He was known for his refinement of George Biddell Airy and John Henry Pratt 's theories of isostasy into his own, the Heiskanen hypothesis.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] With Felix Andries Vening Meinesz , he wrote the textbook The Earth and its Gravity Field (1958), [ 5 ] [ 6 ] and in 1960 a paper by Heiskanen, "The latest achievements of physical geodesy" was discussed in the scientific literature.

[ 7 ] With Helmut Moritz , Heiskanen wrote the textbook Physical Geodesy (1967), which became a standard text the field of geodesy and for the study of the geoid .

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] Heiskanen's doctoral students include Ivan I. Mueller .

Born c.

23 July 1895 [ a ] in Kangaslampi , Finland , he grew up on a small farm. He attended the University of Helsinki and in three years received a Candidate in Philosophy degree (some texts state he received the Master of Science degree).

[ 10 ] [ 11 ] In 1927 he received a Doctor of Philosophy degree from the university.

[ 12 ] The Kaarina and Weikko A. Heiskanen Fund endows the Kaarina and Weikko A. Heiskanen Award, [ 13 ] which is awarded annually by the Ohio State University .

[ 14 ] The university hosted the Weikko A. Heiskanen Symposium in Geodesy in 2002 to celebrate that geodesy had been studied at Ohio State for 50 years.

[ 15 ] A book, Surveyor of the Globe , was written as a biography of Heiskanen by Juhani A. Kakkuri [ fi ] and published in 2008 and 2017.
