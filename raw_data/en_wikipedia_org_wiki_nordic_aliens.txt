[ 1 ] Alleged contactees describe Nordics as being somewhat taller than the average human, standing roughly 6–7 ft (1.8–2.1 m) in height (with an equally proportional weight), and showing stereotypically "European" or "White" features, such as long, straight blond hair , blue eyes , [ 2 ] and fair skin .

[ 3 ] [ 2 ] [ 4 ] The skin tone has also been reported by individuals who say they have seen such beings as being a pale blue-grey or pastel purple.

[ citation needed ] In the 1950s , George Adamski , a Polish-American ufologist, was among the first to publicly report his alleged contact with Nordic beings. Scholars note that the mythology of extraterrestrial visitations from such beings (with physical features superficially described as " Aryan ") often make mention of telepathy , benevolence , and physical beauty and grace; however, many purported alien and extraterrestrial encounters also involve some degree of telepathy serving as the primary communication with human beings.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 1 ] History [ edit ] Cultural historian David J. Skal wrote that early stories of Nordic-type aliens may have been partially inspired by the 1951 film The Day the Earth Stood Still , in which an extraterrestrial arrives on Earth to warn humanity about the dangers of atomic weapons .

[ 6 ] Bates College professor Stephanie Kelley-Romano described alien abduction beliefs as "a living myth", and notes that, among believers, Nordic aliens "are often associated with spiritual growth and love and act as protectors for the experiencers." [ 5 ] In contactee and ufology literature, Nordic aliens are often described as benevolent or even "magical" beings who want to observe and communicate with humans and are concerned about the Earth's ecology or prospects for world peace . Believers also ascribe telepathic powers to Nordic aliens, [ 4 ] and describe them as "paternal, watchful, smiling, affectionate, and youthful".

[ 2 ] During the 1950s, many people alleging to be contactees, especially those in Europe, claimed encounters with beings fitting this description. Such claims became relatively less common in subsequent decades, as the grey alien supplanted the Nordic in most alleged accounts of extraterrestrial encounters.

[ 4 ] Publications by those claiming to have been contacted [ edit ] Books claiming personal contact with Nordic aliens include George Adamski 's Flying Saucers Have Landed [ 7 ] and Inside the Space Ships , [ 8 ] Howard Menger 's From Outer Space to You , [ 9 ] [ 10 ] Travis Walton 's The Walton Experience [ 11 ] and Charles James Hall's Millennial Hospitality [ 12 ] (film adapted as Walking with the Tall Whites (2020).

[ 13 ] The UFO religion Universe People contains a variety of interactions, published as "Talks with Teachings from my Cosmic Friends".
