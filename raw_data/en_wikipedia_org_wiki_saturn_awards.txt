The awards were created to honor science fiction , fantasy , and horror in film, but have since grown to reward other films belonging to genre fiction , as well as television and home media releases. The Saturn Awards were created in 1973 and were originally referred to as Golden Scrolls .

History [ edit ] Vince Gilligan and Aaron Paul at the 2010 Saturn Awards The Saturn Awards were devised by Donald A. Reed in 1973, who felt that work in films in the genre of science fiction at that time lacked recognition within the established Hollywood film industry's award system.

[ 2 ] Initially, the award given was a Golden Scroll certificate.

[ 3 ] In the late 1970s, the award was revamped to a representation of the planet Saturn , with its ring(s) composed of a film reel.

The Saturn Awards are voted upon by members of the presenting Academy. The Academy is a non-profit organization with membership open to the public. Its president and executive producer is Robert Holguin, and producer/writers Bradley Marcus and Kevin Marcus.

[ 4 ] Its members include filmmakers J. J. Abrams , Bryan Singer , Steven Spielberg , Bryan Fuller , Mark A. Altman , Vince Gilligan and James Cameron , among others.

[ 5 ] Although the Awards still primarily focus on films and television in the science fiction, fantasy and horror categories, the Saturns have also recognized productions in other dramatic genres. There are also special awards for lifetime achievement in film production.

Following the 46th ceremony held in 2021, the decision to rebrand what would have been the 47th as the " 50th Saturn Awards " was made in order to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Saturn Awards, which were founded in 1973. Subsequent ceremonies have continued with the new numbering.

[ 6 ] The television categories were majorly overhauled at the 50th ceremony, with several categories being split to recognise both network/cable and streaming series. These changes were reverted at the following ceremony, however. In 2023, the nominations announcement and awards process for the 51st Saturn Awards was postponed by several months in solidarity with the 2023 Hollywood labor disputes .

"The problem is that, over time, the Saturn Awards have stretched the meaning of genre so far that it legitimately has no meaning. <...> Rather than seeming like a legitimate celebration of science fiction, fantasy or horror, the Saturn Awards read like an unflattering and at points embarrassing collection of films and television series which reflect not the best that genre has to offer, but rather a desperate attempt to tap into the cultural zeitgeist while masquerading as a celebration of the underappreciated.
