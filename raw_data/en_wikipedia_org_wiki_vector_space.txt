Vector addition and scalar multiplication: a vector **v** (blue) is added to another vector **w** (red, upper illustration). Below, **w** is stretched by a factor of 2, yielding the sum **v** + 2**w**.

In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics") and [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics"), a **vector space** (also called a **linear space**) is a [set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics) "Set (mathematics)") whose elements, often called [_vectors_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(mathematics_and_physics) "Vector (mathematics and physics)"), can be added together and multiplied ("scaled") by numbers called [_scalars_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_(mathematics) "Scalar (mathematics)"). The operations of vector addition and [scalar multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_multiplication "Scalar multiplication") must satisfy certain requirements, called _vector [axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom "Axiom")_. **Real vector spaces** and **complex vector spaces** are kinds of vector spaces based on different kinds of scalars: [real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_numbers "Real numbers") and [complex numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_numbers "Complex numbers"). Scalars can also be, more generally, elements of any [field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics) "Field (mathematics)").

Vector spaces generalize [Euclidean vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector "Euclidean vector"), which allow modeling of [physical quantities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_quantity "Physical quantity") (such as [forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force "Force") and [velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity "Velocity")) that have not only a [magnitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnitude_(mathematics) "Magnitude (mathematics)"), but also a [direction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientation_(geometry) "Orientation (geometry)"). The concept of vector spaces is fundamental for [linear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra "Linear algebra"), together with the concept of [matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics) "Matrix (mathematics)"), which allows computing in vector spaces. This provides a concise and synthetic way for manipulating and studying [systems of linear equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_of_linear_equations "Systems of linear equations").

Vector spaces are characterized by their [dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension_(vector_space) "Dimension (vector space)"), which, roughly speaking, specifies the number of independent directions in the space. This means that, for two vector spaces over a given field and with the same dimension, the properties that depend only on the vector-space structure are exactly the same (technically the vector spaces are [isomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphic "Isomorphic")). A vector space is _finite-dimensional_ if its dimension is a [natural number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number "Natural number"). Otherwise, it is _infinite-dimensional_, and its dimension is an [infinite cardinal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfinite_number "Transfinite number"). Finite-dimensional vector spaces occur naturally in [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry") and related areas. Infinite-dimensional vector spaces occur in many areas of mathematics. For example, [polynomial rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_ring "Polynomial ring") are [countably](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countably_infinite "Countably infinite") infinite-dimensional vector spaces, and many [function spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_space "Function space") have the [cardinality of the continuum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality_of_the_continuum "Cardinality of the continuum") as a dimension.

Many vector spaces that are considered in mathematics are also endowed with other [structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_structure "Mathematical structure"). This is the case of [algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra_over_a_field "Algebra over a field"), which include [field extensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_extension "Field extension"), polynomial rings, [associative algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_algebra "Associative algebra") and [Lie algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_algebra "Lie algebra"). This is also the case of [topological vector spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_vector_space "Topological vector space"), which include function spaces, [inner product spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_product_space "Inner product space"), [normed spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normed_vector_space "Normed vector space"), [Hilbert spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_space "Hilbert space") and [Banach spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach_space "Banach space").

Definition and basic properties
-------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vector_space&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Definition and basic properties")]

In this article, vectors are represented in boldface to distinguish them from scalars.[[nb 1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-1)[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTELang2002-2)

A vector space over a [field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics) "Field (mathematics)")F is a non-empty [set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics) "Set (mathematics)")V together with a [binary operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_operation "Binary operation") and a [binary function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_function "Binary function") that satisfy the eight [axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom "Axiom") listed below. In this context, the elements of V are commonly called _vectors_, and the elements of F are called _scalars_.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBrown199186-3)

*   The binary operation, called _vector addition_ or simply _addition_ assigns to any two vectors**v** and **w** in V a third vector in V which is commonly written as **v** + **w**, and called the _sum_ of these two vectors.

*   The binary function, called _[scalar multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar\_multiplication "Scalar multiplication")_, assigns to any scalar a in F and any vector**v** in V another vector in V, which is denoted _a_**v**.[[nb 2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-4)

To have a vector space, the eight following [axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom "Axiom") must be satisfied for every **u**, **v** and **w** in V, and a and b in F.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTERoman2005ch._1,_p._27-5)

| Axiom | Statement |
| --- | --- |
| [Associativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associativity "Associativity") of vector addition | **u** + (**v** + **w**) = (**u** + **v**) + **w** |
| [Commutativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutativity "Commutativity") of vector addition | **u** + **v** = **v** + **u** |
| [Identity element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_element "Identity element") of vector addition | There exists an element **0** ∈ _V_, called the _[zero vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero\_vector "Zero vector")_, such that **v** + **0** = **v** for all **v** ∈ _V_. |
| [Inverse elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_element "Inverse element") of vector addition | For every **v** ∈ _V_, there exists an element −**v** ∈ _V_, called the _[additive inverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive\_inverse "Additive inverse")_ of **v**, such that **v** + (−**v**) = **0**. |
| Compatibility of scalar multiplication with field multiplication | _a_(_b_**v**) = (_ab_)**v**[[nb 3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-6) |
| Identity element of scalar multiplication | 1**v** = **v**, where 1 denotes the [multiplicative identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicative_identity "Multiplicative identity") in F. |
| [Distributivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributivity "Distributivity") of scalar multiplication with respect to vector addition | _a_(**u** + **v**) = _a_**u** + _a_**v** |
| Distributivity of scalar multiplication with respect to field addition | (_a_ + _b_)**v** = _a_**v** + _b_**v** |

When the scalar field is the [real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number"), the vector space is called a _real vector space_, and when the scalar field is the [complex numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number "Complex number"), the vector space is called a _complex vector space_.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBrown199187-7) These two cases are the most common ones, but vector spaces with scalars in an arbitrary field F are also commonly considered. Such a vector space is called an F-_vector space_ or a _vector space over F_.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTESpringer2000[httpsbooksgooglecombooksidCes-AAAAQBAJpgPA185_185]Brown199186-8)

An equivalent definition of a vector space can be given, which is much more concise but less elementary: the first four axioms (related to vector addition) say that a vector space is an [abelian group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelian_group "Abelian group") under addition, and the four remaining axioms (related to the scalar multiplication) say that this operation defines a [ring homomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_homomorphism "Ring homomorphism") from the field _F_ into the [endomorphism ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endomorphism_ring "Endomorphism ring") of this group.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAtiyahMacdonald196917-9)

Subtraction of two vectors can be defined as ![Image 2: {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} -\mathbf {w} =\mathbf {v} +(-\mathbf {w} ).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/57d7e4e2d1ff332517fe5afbda913e8f33df1ada)

Direct consequences of the axioms include that, for every ![Image 3: {\displaystyle s\in F}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f6fe9319682deb1cd7944bfec2a95227c49045ce) and ![Image 4: {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} \in V,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/794f60364056e7f3afbf6dbd23f17740438e1ef1) one has

Even more concisely, a vector space is a [module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Module_(mathematics) "Module (mathematics)") over a [field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics) "Field (mathematics)").[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBourbaki1998%C2%A71.1,_Definition_2-10)

Bases, vector coordinates, and subspaces
----------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vector_space&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Bases, vector coordinates, and subspaces")]

[![Image 5](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Vector_components_and_base_change.svg/200px-Vector_components_and_base_change.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Vector_components_and_base_change.svg)

A vector **v** in **R**2 (blue) expressed in terms of different bases: using the [standard basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_basis "Standard basis") of **R**2: **v** = _x_**e**1 + _y_**e**2 (black), and using a different, non-[orthogonal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_vector "Orthogonal vector") basis: **v** = **f**1 + **f**2 (red).

[Linear combination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_combination "Linear combination")Given a set G of elements of a F-vector space V, a linear combination of elements of G is an element of V of the form ![Image 6: {\displaystyle a_{1}\mathbf {g} _{1}+a_{2}\mathbf {g} _{2}+\cdots +a_{k}\mathbf {g} _{k},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fc4875d560ecf3338a56c7bf33c46cf1f80edec4) where ![Image 7: {\displaystyle a_{1},\ldots ,a_{k}\in F}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8f66f5987b771668981dd85c7ada3ce3b3bea551) and ![Image 8: {\displaystyle \mathbf {g} _{1},\ldots ,\mathbf {g} _{k}\in G.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4b0817f411cb5afaaba86961d8b13e31b0a66d68) The scalars ![Image 9: {\displaystyle a_{1},\ldots ,a_{k}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fe9c0425acf7d429b00d87e9a650d8f277dfe7b0) are called the _coefficients_ of the linear combination.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBrown199194-11)[Linear independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_independence "Linear independence")The elements of a subset G of a F-vector space V are said to be _linearly independent_ if no element of G can be written as a linear combination of the other elements of G. Equivalently, they are linearly independent if two linear combinations of elements of G define the same element of V if and only if they have the same coefficients. Also equivalently, they are linearly independent if a linear combination results in the zero vector if and only if all its coefficients are zero.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBrown199199%E2%80%93101-12)[Linear subspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_subspace "Linear subspace")A _linear subspace_ or _vector subspace_ W of a vector space V is a non-empty subset of V that is [closed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(mathematics) "Closure (mathematics)") under vector addition and scalar multiplication; that is, the sum of two elements of W and the product of an element of W by a scalar belong to W.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBrown199192-13) This implies that every linear combination of elements of W belongs to W. A linear subspace is a vector space for the induced addition and scalar multiplication; this means that the closure property implies that the axioms of a vector space are satisfied.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTEStollWong1968[httpsbooksgooglecombooksidgLbiBQAAQBAJpgPA14_14]-14)

The closure property also implies that _every [intersection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersection\_(set\_theory) "Intersection (set theory)") of linear subspaces is a linear subspace._[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTEStollWong1968[httpsbooksgooglecombooksidgLbiBQAAQBAJpgPA14_14]-14)[Linear span](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_span "Linear span")Given a subset G of a vector space V, the _linear span_ or simply the _span_ of G is the smallest linear subspace of V that contains G, in the sense that it is the intersection of all linear subspaces that contain G. The span of G is also the set of all linear combinations of elements of G.

 If W is the span of G, one says that G _spans_ or _generates_ W, and that G is a _[spanning set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanning\_set "Spanning set")_ or a _generating set_ of W.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTERoman200541%E2%80%9342-15)[Basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_(linear_algebra) "Basis (linear algebra)") and [dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension_(vector_space) "Dimension (vector space)")A subset of a vector space is a _basis_ if its elements are linearly independent and span the vector space.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTELang198710%E2%80%9311AntonRorres2010[httpsbooksgooglecombooksid1PJ-WHepeBsCpgPA212_212]-16) Every vector space has at least one basis, or many in general (see [Basis (linear algebra) §Proof that every vector space has a basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_(linear_algebra)#Proof_that_every_vector_space_has_a_basis "Basis (linear algebra)")).[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBlass1984-17) Moreover, all bases of a vector space have the same [cardinality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality "Cardinality"), which is called the _dimension_ of the vector space (see [Dimension theorem for vector spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension_theorem_for_vector_spaces "Dimension theorem for vector spaces")).[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTEJoshi1989[httpsbooksgooglecombooksidRM1D3mFw2u0CpgPA450_450]-18) This is a fundamental property of vector spaces, which is detailed in the remainder of the section.
_Bases_ are a fundamental tool for the study of vector spaces, especially when the dimension is finite. In the infinite-dimensional case, the existence of infinite bases, often called [Hamel bases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamel_bases "Hamel bases"), depends on the [axiom of choice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_choice "Axiom of choice"). It follows that, in general, no base can be explicitly described.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHeil2011[httpsbooksgooglecombooksidprfuUT0Sw-ACpgPA126_126]-19) For example, the [real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number") form an infinite-dimensional vector space over the [rational numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_number "Rational number"), for which no specific basis is known.

Consider a basis ![Image 10: {\displaystyle (\mathbf {b} _{1},\mathbf {b} _{2},\ldots ,\mathbf {b} _{n})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c3f35afac8a96873cb899fbdc1dfa6663225581b) of a vector space V of dimension n over a field F. The definition of a basis implies that every ![Image 11: {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} \in V}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/aeb70f294c05e671203c3b21e7f5fb3d0b9a0ced) may be written ![Image 12: {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} =a_{1}\mathbf {b} _{1}+\cdots +a_{n}\mathbf {b} _{n},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/23433c59a98965eca86b8556cbbbbbb96ca989d4) with ![Image 13: {\displaystyle a_{1},\dots ,a_{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/852381be25b656d697c7a4a9634d3dc4c182d833) in F, and that this decomposition is unique. The scalars ![Image 14: {\displaystyle a_{1},\ldots ,a_{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/451345cc97e2ed923dd4656fcc400c3f37119cca) are called the _coordinates_ of **v** on the basis. They are also said to be the _coefficients_ of the decomposition of **v** on the basis. One also says that the n-[tuple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuple "Tuple") of the coordinates is the [coordinate vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_vector "Coordinate vector") of **v** on the basis, since the set ![Image 15: {\displaystyle F^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/caeaf2cf3b94c8a21721478bcd52964068489df9) of the n-tuples of elements of F is a vector space for [componentwise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Componentwise_operation "Componentwise operation") addition and scalar multiplication, whose dimension is n.

The [one-to-one correspondence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-to-one_correspondence "One-to-one correspondence") between vectors and their coordinate vectors maps vector addition to vector addition and scalar multiplication to scalar multiplication. It is thus a [vector space isomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space_isomorphism "Vector space isomorphism"), which allows translating reasonings and computations on vectors into reasonings and computations on their coordinates.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHalmos1948[httpsbooksgooglecombooksid1hzYCwAAQBAJpgPA12_12]-20)

Vector spaces stem from [affine geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_geometry "Affine geometry"), via the introduction of [coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate "Coordinate") in the plane or three-dimensional space. Around 1636, French mathematicians [René Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes "René Descartes") and [Pierre de Fermat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_de_Fermat "Pierre de Fermat") founded [analytic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_geometry "Analytic geometry") by identifying solutions to an equation of two variables with points on a plane [curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve "Curve").[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBourbaki1969ch._%22Alg%C3%A8bre_lin%C3%A9aire_et_alg%C3%A8bre_multilin%C3%A9aire%22,_pp._78%E2%80%9391-21) To achieve geometric solutions without using coordinates, [Bolzano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernhard_Bolzano "Bernhard Bolzano") introduced, in 1804, certain operations on points, lines, and planes, which are predecessors of vectors.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBolzano1804-22)[Möbius (1827)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#CITEREFM%C3%B6bius1827) introduced the notion of [barycentric coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barycentric_coordinates_(mathematics) "Barycentric coordinates (mathematics)").[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTEM%C3%B6bius1827-23)[Bellavitis (1833)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#CITEREFBellavitis1833) introduced an [equivalence relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_relation "Equivalence relation") on directed line segments that share the same length and direction which he called [equipollence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equipollence_(geometry) "Equipollence (geometry)").[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBellavitis1833-24) A [Euclidean vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector "Euclidean vector") is then an [equivalence class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_class "Equivalence class") of that relation.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDorier1995-25)

Vectors were reconsidered with the presentation of [complex numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_numbers "Complex numbers") by [Argand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Robert_Argand "Jean-Robert Argand") and [Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton "William Rowan Hamilton") and the inception of [quaternions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion "Quaternion") by the latter.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHamilton1853-26) They are elements in **R**2 and **R**4; treating them using [linear combinations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_combination "Linear combination") goes back to [Laguerre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laguerre "Laguerre") in 1867, who also defined [systems of linear equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_linear_equations "System of linear equations").

In 1857, [Cayley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Cayley "Arthur Cayley") introduced the [matrix notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_notation "Matrix notation") which allows for harmonization and simplification of [linear maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_map "Linear map"). Around the same time, [Grassmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassmann "Grassmann") studied the barycentric calculus initiated by Möbius. He envisaged sets of abstract objects endowed with operations.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGrassmann2000-27) In his work, the concepts of [linear independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_independence "Linear independence") and [dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension "Dimension"), as well as [scalar products](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_product "Scalar product") are present. Grassmann's 1844 work exceeds the framework of vector spaces as well since his considering multiplication led him to what are today called [algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebras_over_a_field "Algebras over a field"). Italian mathematician [Peano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Peano "Giuseppe Peano") was the first to give the modern definition of vector spaces and linear maps in 1888,[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPeano1888ch._IX-28) although he called them "linear systems".[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGuo2021-29) Peano's axiomatization allowed for vector spaces with infinite dimension, but Peano did not develop that theory further. In 1897, [Salvatore Pincherle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvatore_Pincherle "Salvatore Pincherle") adopted Peano's axioms and made initial inroads into the theory of infinite-dimensional vector spaces.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMoore1995268%E2%80%93271-30)

An important development of vector spaces is due to the construction of [function spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_spaces "Function spaces") by [Henri Lebesgue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Lebesgue "Henri Lebesgue"). This was later formalized by [Banach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Banach "Stefan Banach") and [Hilbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hilbert "David Hilbert"), around 1920.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBanach1922-31) At that time, [algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra "Algebra") and the new field of [functional analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_analysis "Functional analysis") began to interact, notably with key concepts such as [spaces of _p_-integrable functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lp_space "Lp space") and [Hilbert spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_space "Hilbert space").[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDorier1995Moore1995-32)

Scalar multiplication: the multiples −**v** and 2**w** are shown.

The first example of a vector space consists of [arrows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow_(symbol) "Arrow (symbol)") in a fixed [plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(geometry) "Plane (geometry)"), starting at one fixed point. This is used in physics to describe [forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force "Force") or [velocities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity "Velocity").[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKreyszig2020[httpsbooksgooglecombooksidw4T3DwAAQBAJpgPA355_355]-33) Given any two such arrows, **v** and **w**, the [parallelogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallelogram "Parallelogram") spanned by these two arrows contains one diagonal arrow that starts at the origin, too. This new arrow is called the _sum_ of the two arrows, and is denoted **v** + **w**. In the special case of two arrows on the same line, their sum is the arrow on this line whose length is the sum or the difference of the lengths, depending on whether the arrows have the same direction. Another operation that can be done with arrows is scaling: given any positive [real number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number")_a_, the arrow that has the same direction as **v**, but is dilated or shrunk by multiplying its length by _a_, is called _multiplication_ of **v** by _a_. It is denoted _a_**v**. When _a_ is negative, _a_**v** is defined as the arrow pointing in the opposite direction instead.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKreyszig2020[httpsbooksgooglecombooksidw4T3DwAAQBAJpgPA358_358%E2%80%93359]-34)

The following shows a few examples: if _a_ = 2, the resulting vector _a_**w** has the same direction as **w**, but is stretched to the double length of **w** (the second image). Equivalently, 2**w** is the sum **w** + **w**. Moreover, (−1)**v** = −**v** has the opposite direction and the same length as **v** (blue vector pointing down in the second image).

### Ordered pairs of numbers

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vector_space&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Ordered pairs of numbers")]

A second key example of a vector space is provided by pairs of real numbers x and y. The order of the components x and y is significant, so such a pair is also called an [ordered pair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_pair "Ordered pair"). Such a pair is written as (_x_, _y_). The sum of two such pairs and the multiplication of a pair with a number is defined as follows:[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTEJain2001[httpsbooksgooglecombooksid-lzAee3uQtICpgPA11_11]-35)![Image 18: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}(x_{1},y_{1})+(x_{2},y_{2})&=(x_{1}+x_{2},y_{1}+y_{2}),\\a(x,y)&=(ax,ay).\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0b70e5ac60990df36550d2cc24b8d3004c608656)

The first example above reduces to this example if an arrow is represented by a pair of [Cartesian coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinates "Cartesian coordinates") of its endpoint.

The simplest example of a vector space over a field _F_ is the field _F_ itself with its addition viewed as vector addition and its multiplication viewed as scalar multiplication. More generally, all [_n_-tuples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuple "Tuple") (sequences of length _n_) ![Image 19: {\displaystyle (a_{1},a_{2},\dots ,a_{n})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0301ea4e20db36959a961fefe4e3e38a667964d8) of elements _a_ _i_ of _F_ form a vector space that is usually denoted _F_ _n_ and called a **coordinate space**.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTELang1987ch._I.1-36) The case _n_ = 1 is the above-mentioned simplest example, in which the field _F_ is also regarded as a vector space over itself. The case _F_ = **R** and _n_ = 2 (so **R**2) reduces to the previous example.

### Complex numbers and other field extensions

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vector_space&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Complex numbers and other field extensions")]

The set of [complex numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_numbers "Complex numbers")**C**, numbers that can be written in the form _x_ + _iy_ for [real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_numbers "Real numbers")_x_ and _y_ where _i_ is the [imaginary unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaginary_unit "Imaginary unit"), form a vector space over the reals with the usual addition and multiplication: (_x_ + _iy_) + (_a_ + _ib_) = (_x_ + _a_) + _i_(_y_ + _b_) and _c_ ⋅ (_x_ + _iy_) = (_c_ ⋅ _x_) + _i_(_c_ ⋅ _y_) for real numbers _x_, _y_, _a_, _b_ and _c_. The various axioms of a vector space follow from the fact that the same rules hold for complex number arithmetic. The example of complex numbers is essentially the same as (that is, it is _isomorphic_ to) the vector space of ordered pairs of real numbers mentioned above: if we think of the complex number _x_ + _i_ _y_ as representing the ordered pair (_x_, _y_) in the [complex plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_plane "Complex plane") then we see that the rules for addition and scalar multiplication correspond exactly to those in the earlier example.

More generally, [field extensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_extension "Field extension") provide another class of examples of vector spaces, particularly in algebra and [algebraic number theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_number_theory "Algebraic number theory"): a field _F_ containing a [smaller field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_extension "Field extension")_E_ is an _E_-vector space, by the given multiplication and addition operations of _F_.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTELang2002ch._V.1-37) For example, the complex numbers are a vector space over **R**, and the field extension ![Image 20: {\displaystyle \mathbf {Q} (i{\sqrt {5}})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/79cf13737fd8630f04a1028028c44e95b4729be0) is a vector space over **Q**.

[![Image 21](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/Example_for_addition_of_functions.svg/250px-Example_for_addition_of_functions.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Example_for_addition_of_functions.svg)

Addition of functions: the sum of the sine and the exponential function is ![Image 22: {\displaystyle \sin +\exp :\mathbb {R} \to \mathbb {R} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f5f3afcecd5be8d1b1d1f1a990a4a5dac441daa9) with ![Image 23: {\displaystyle (\sin +\exp )(x)=\sin(x)+\exp(x)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/cc39721fd4825bb41ad0bb72835e65db80e490f3).

Functions from any fixed set Ω to a field _F_ also form vector spaces, by performing addition and scalar multiplication pointwise. That is, the sum of two functions _f_ and _g_ is the function ![Image 24: {\displaystyle (f+g)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/18ff99e669a82b98573d50cad35d6d2dc8402b5b) given by ![Image 25: {\displaystyle (f+g)(w)=f(w)+g(w),}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9bab026cce85931998fc137b8a02416c02260189) and similarly for multiplication. Such function spaces occur in many geometric situations, when Ω is the [real line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_line "Real line") or an [interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics) "Interval (mathematics)"), or other [subsets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset "Subset") of **R**. Many notions in topology and analysis, such as [continuity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function "Continuous function"), [integrability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral "Integral") or [differentiability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiability "Differentiability") are well-behaved with respect to linearity: sums and scalar multiples of functions possessing such a property still have that property.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTELang1993ch._XII.3.,_p._335-38) Therefore, the set of such functions are vector spaces, whose study belongs to [functional analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_analysis "Functional analysis").

Systems of [homogeneous linear equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_linear_equation "Homogeneous linear equation") are closely tied to vector spaces.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTELang1987ch._VI.3.-39) For example, the solutions of ![Image 26: {\displaystyle {\begin{alignedat}{9}&&a\,&&+\,3b\,&\,+&\,&c&\,=0\\4&&a\,&&+\,2b\,&\,+&\,2&c&\,=0\\\end{alignedat}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6aebf9bf8985666ed710395bef8cb0f7ab540634) are given by triples with arbitrary ![Image 27: {\displaystyle a,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f059f053fcf9f421b7c74362cf3bd5ed024e19d1)![Image 28: {\displaystyle b=a/2,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b27f037b8e9aba144fb73ed74634611997b7bd4f) and ![Image 29: {\displaystyle c=-5a/2.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7a0b11abd3d89d8d7ff42d1567e1e24459d14f79) They form a vector space: sums and scalar multiples of such triples still satisfy the same ratios of the three variables; thus they are solutions, too. [Matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics) "Matrix (mathematics)") can be used to condense multiple linear equations as above into one vector equation, namely

![Image 30: {\displaystyle A\mathbf {x} =\mathbf {0} ,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2febae9e52381255ec6072203b6bf65a0c5f611a)

where ![Image 31: {\displaystyle A={\begin{bmatrix}1&3&1\\4&2&2\end{bmatrix}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d7540136866058593b6dc72b68d4bb0ca3ba8ddc) is the matrix containing the coefficients of the given equations, ![Image 32: {\displaystyle \mathbf {x} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/32adf004df5eb0a8c7fd8c0b6b7405183c5a5ef2) is the vector ![Image 33: {\displaystyle (a,b,c),}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8c052387768871591c5823a1c4ae9c057e95676d)![Image 34: {\displaystyle A\mathbf {x} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/49d802e9b456b1476fcf3e6fd73b0bf266727c95) denotes the [matrix product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_product "Matrix product"), and ![Image 35: {\displaystyle \mathbf {0} =(0,0)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/015934e10a84cfdabab9ec9b8647f6960dd37dcf) is the zero vector. In a similar vein, the solutions of homogeneous _linear differential equations_ form vector spaces. For example,

![Image 36: {\displaystyle f^{\prime \prime }(x)+2f^{\prime }(x)+f(x)=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6721f2ddd15edfaa7bfc741f6b3cf5cd7ca64407)

yields ![Image 37: {\displaystyle f(x)=ae^{-x}+bxe^{-x},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9f878ee6a61dd1ed463a7553069f0cd028c1d52d) where ![Image 38: {\displaystyle a}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ffd2487510aa438433a2579450ab2b3d557e5edc) and ![Image 39: {\displaystyle b}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f11423fbb2e967f986e36804a8ae4271734917c3) are arbitrary constants, and ![Image 40: {\displaystyle e^{x}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/841c0d168e64191c45a45e54c7e447defd17ec6a) is the [natural exponential function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_exponential_function "Natural exponential function").

Linear maps and matrices
------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vector_space&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Linear maps and matrices")]

The relation of two vector spaces can be expressed by _linear map_ or _[linear transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear\_transformation "Linear transformation")_. They are [functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics) "Function (mathematics)") that reflect the vector space structure, that is, they preserve sums and scalar multiplication: ![Image 41: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}f(\mathbf {v} +\mathbf {w} )&=f(\mathbf {v} )+f(\mathbf {w} ),\\f(a\cdot \mathbf {v} )&=a\cdot f(\mathbf {v} )\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9681922d7136c6d4c62fa80cbe835e6565c091e7) for all ![Image 42: {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/35c1866e359fbfd2e0f606c725ba5cc37a5195d6) and ![Image 43: {\displaystyle \mathbf {w} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/20795664b5b048744a2fd88977851104cc5816f8) in ![Image 44: {\displaystyle V,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ace9595e3ce66fdec7e9d30202626accd676b11e) all ![Image 45: {\displaystyle a}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ffd2487510aa438433a2579450ab2b3d557e5edc) in ![Image 46: {\displaystyle F.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a6b34655c2ef19b56c81af0e6d1f2f6df0d3ed33)[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTERoman2005ch._2,_p._45-40)

An _[isomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphism "Isomorphism")_ is a linear map _f_: _V_ → _W_ such that there exists an [inverse map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_map "Inverse map")_g_: _W_ → _V_, which is a map such that the two possible [compositions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_composition "Function composition")_f_ ∘ _g_: _W_ → _W_ and _g_ ∘ _f_: _V_ → _V_ are [identity maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_function "Identity function"). Equivalently, _f_ is both one-to-one ([injective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injective "Injective")) and onto ([surjective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surjective "Surjective")).[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTELang1987ch._IV.4,_Corollary,_p._106-41) If there exists an isomorphism between _V_ and _W_, the two spaces are said to be _isomorphic_; they are then essentially identical as vector spaces, since all identities holding in _V_ are, via _f_, transported to similar ones in _W_, and vice versa via _g_.

[![Image 47](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Vector_components.svg/180px-Vector_components.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Vector_components.svg)

Describing an arrow vector **v** by its coordinates _x_ and _y_ yields an isomorphism of vector spaces.

For example, the arrows in the plane and the ordered pairs of numbers vector spaces in the introduction above (see [§Examples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#Examples)) are isomorphic: a planar arrow **v** departing at the [origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_(mathematics) "Origin (mathematics)") of some (fixed) [coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_system "Coordinate system") can be expressed as an ordered pair by considering the _x_- and _y_-component of the arrow, as shown in the image at the right. Conversely, given a pair (_x_, _y_), the arrow going by _x_ to the right (or to the left, if _x_ is negative), and _y_ up (down, if _y_ is negative) turns back the arrow **v**.[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTENicholson2018ch._7.3-42)

Linear maps _V_ → _W_ between two vector spaces form a vector space Hom _F_(_V_, _W_), also denoted L(_V_, _W_), or 𝓛(_V_, _W_).[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTELang1987Example_IV.2.6-43) The space of linear maps from _V_ to _F_ is called the _[dual vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual\_vector\_space "Dual vector space")_, denoted _V_∗.[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTELang1987ch._VI.6-44) Via the injective [natural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_(category_theory) "Natural (category theory)") map _V_ → _V_∗∗, any vector space can be embedded into its _bidual_; the map is an isomorphism if and only if the space is finite-dimensional.[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHalmos1974p._28,_Ex._9-45)

Once a basis of _V_ is chosen, linear maps _f_: _V_ → _W_ are completely determined by specifying the images of the basis vectors, because any element of _V_ is expressed uniquely as a linear combination of them.[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTELang1987Theorem_IV.2.1,_p._95-46) If dim _V_ = dim _W_, a [1-to-1 correspondence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijection "Bijection") between fixed bases of _V_ and _W_ gives rise to a linear map that maps any basis element of _V_ to the corresponding basis element of _W_. It is an isomorphism, by its very definition.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTERoman2005Th._2.5_and_2.6,_p._49-47) Therefore, two vector spaces over a given field are isomorphic if their dimensions agree and vice versa. Another way to express this is that any vector space over a given field is _completely classified_ ([up to](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_to "Up to") isomorphism) by its dimension, a single number. In particular, any _n_-dimensional _F_-vector space _V_ is isomorphic to _F_ _n_. However, there is no "canonical" or preferred isomorphism; an isomorphism _φ_: _F_ _n_ → _V_ is equivalent to the choice of a basis of _V_, by mapping the standard basis of _F_ _n_ to _V_, via _φ_.

[![Image 48](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/Matrix.svg/200px-Matrix.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Matrix.svg)

A typical matrix

_Matrices_ are a useful notion to encode linear maps.[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTELang1987ch._V.1-48) They are written as a rectangular array of scalars as in the image at the right. Any _m_-by-_n_ matrix ![Image 49: {\displaystyle A}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3) gives rise to a linear map from _F_ _n_ to _F_ _m_, by the following ![Image 50: {\displaystyle \mathbf {x} =(x_{1},x_{2},\ldots ,x_{n})\mapsto \left(\sum _{j=1}^{n}a_{1j}x_{j},\sum _{j=1}^{n}a_{2j}x_{j},\ldots ,\sum _{j=1}^{n}a_{mj}x_{j}\right),}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/19c4e62a6ac16d4156d7fccadb5bf0346e1bf4a5) where ![Image 51: {\textstyle \sum }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8e2b0b7618be940f4e8c0d27f05ab75fbc13e83c) denotes [summation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summation "Summation"), or by using the [matrix multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_multiplication "Matrix multiplication") of the matrix ![Image 52: {\displaystyle A}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3) with the coordinate vector ![Image 53: {\displaystyle \mathbf {x} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/32adf004df5eb0a8c7fd8c0b6b7405183c5a5ef2):

![Image 54: {\displaystyle \mathbf {x} \mapsto A\mathbf {x} .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/cc8e51a6109f62db762d60aa65e7fd6b0266b0fc)

Moreover, after choosing bases of _V_ and _W_, _any_ linear map _f_: _V_ → _W_ is uniquely represented by a matrix via this assignment.[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTELang1987ch._V.3.,_Corollary,_p._106-49)

[![Image 55](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/Determinant_parallelepiped.svg/250px-Determinant_parallelepiped.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Determinant_parallelepiped.svg)

The volume of this [parallelepiped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallelepiped "Parallelepiped") is the absolute value of the determinant of the 3-by-3 matrix formed by the vectors **r**1, **r**2, and **r**3.

The [determinant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant "Determinant")det (_A_) of a [square matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_matrix "Square matrix")_A_ is a scalar that tells whether the associated map is an isomorphism or not: to be so it is sufficient and necessary that the determinant is nonzero.[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTELang1987Theorem_VII.9.8,_p._198-50) The linear transformation of **R**_n_ corresponding to a real _n_-by-_n_ matrix is [orientation preserving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientation_(vector_space) "Orientation (vector space)") if and only if its determinant is positive.

### Eigenvalues and eigenvectors

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vector_space&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Eigenvalues and eigenvectors")]

[Endomorphisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endomorphism "Endomorphism"), linear maps _f_: _V_ → _V_, are particularly important since in this case vectors **v** can be compared with their image under _f_, _f_(**v**). Any nonzero vector **v** satisfying _λ_**v** = _f_(**v**), where _λ_ is a scalar, is called an _eigenvector_ of _f_ with _eigenvalue_ _λ_.[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTERoman2005ch._8,_p._135%E2%80%93156-51) Equivalently, **v** is an element of the [kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(linear_algebra) "Kernel (linear algebra)") of the difference _f_ − _λ_ · Id (where Id is the [identity map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_function "Identity function")_V_ → _V_). If _V_ is finite-dimensional, this can be rephrased using determinants: _f_ having eigenvalue _λ_ is equivalent to ![Image 56: {\displaystyle \det(f-\lambda \cdot \operatorname {Id} )=0.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e9d369d3a0465cb4b54b0f9c37f0e403e39daa31) By spelling out the definition of the determinant, the expression on the left hand side can be seen to be a polynomial function in _λ_, called the [characteristic polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_polynomial "Characteristic polynomial") of _f_.[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTELang1987ch._IX.4-52) If the field _F_ is large enough to contain a zero of this polynomial (which automatically happens for _F_[algebraically closed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraically_closed_field "Algebraically closed field"), such as _F_ = **C**) any linear map has at least one eigenvector. The vector space _V_ may or may not possess an [eigenbasis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenbasis "Eigenbasis"), a basis consisting of eigenvectors. This phenomenon is governed by the [Jordan canonical form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_canonical_form "Jordan canonical form") of the map.[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTERoman2005ch._8,_p._140-53) The set of all eigenvectors corresponding to a particular eigenvalue of _f_ forms a vector space known as the _eigenspace_ corresponding to the eigenvalue (and _f_) in question.

Basic constructions
-------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vector_space&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Basic constructions")]

In addition to the above concrete examples, there are a number of standard linear algebraic constructions that yield vector spaces related to given ones.

### Subspaces and quotient spaces

A line passing through the [origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_(mathematics) "Origin (mathematics)") (blue, thick) in [**R**3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space") is a linear subspace. It is the intersection of two [planes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(mathematics) "Plane (mathematics)") (green and yellow).

A nonempty [subset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset "Subset")![Image 58: {\displaystyle W}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/54a9c4c547f4d6111f81946cad242b18298d70b7) of a vector space ![Image 59: {\displaystyle V}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/af0f6064540e84211d0ffe4dac72098adfa52845) that is closed under addition and scalar multiplication (and therefore contains the ![Image 60: {\displaystyle \mathbf {0} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/62e8c650763635a93ddc69768c3c0c100afe985d)-vector of ![Image 61: {\displaystyle V}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/af0f6064540e84211d0ffe4dac72098adfa52845)) is called a _linear subspace_ of ![Image 62: {\displaystyle V}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/af0f6064540e84211d0ffe4dac72098adfa52845), or simply a _subspace_ of ![Image 63: {\displaystyle V}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/af0f6064540e84211d0ffe4dac72098adfa52845), when the ambient space is unambiguously a vector space.[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTERoman2005ch._1,_p._29-54)[[nb 4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-55) Subspaces of ![Image 64: {\displaystyle V}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/af0f6064540e84211d0ffe4dac72098adfa52845) are vector spaces (over the same field) in their own right. The intersection of all subspaces containing a given set ![Image 65: {\displaystyle S}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4611d85173cd3b508e67077d4a1252c9c05abca2) of vectors is called its [span](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_span "Linear span"), and it is the smallest subspace of ![Image 66: {\displaystyle V}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/af0f6064540e84211d0ffe4dac72098adfa52845) containing the set ![Image 67: {\displaystyle S}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4611d85173cd3b508e67077d4a1252c9c05abca2).

Linear subspace of dimension 1 and 2 are referred to as a _line_ (also _vector line_), and a _plane_ respectively. If _W_ is an _n_-dimensional vector space, any subspace of dimension 1 less, i.e., of dimension ![Image 69: {\displaystyle n-1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fbd0b0f32b28f51962943ee9ede4fb34198a2521) is called a _[hyperplane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplane "Hyperplane")_.[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTENicholson2018ch._10.4-57)

### Direct product and direct sum

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vector_space&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Direct product and direct sum")]

The _direct product_ of vector spaces and the _direct sum_ of vector spaces are two ways of combining an indexed family of vector spaces into a new vector space.

The _direct product_![Image 111: {\displaystyle \textstyle {\prod _{i\in I}V_{i}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4b7276b7a71c0022b5221c0a2a891548b1b01159) of a family of vector spaces ![Image 112: {\displaystyle V_{i}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f300b83673e961a9d48f3862216b167f94e5668c) consists of the set of all tuples ![Image 113: {\displaystyle \left(\mathbf {v} _{i}\right)_{i\in I}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/51b0c3b6453355a143a01f1222f310c7bb4dd9d6), which specify for each index ![Image 114: {\displaystyle i}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/add78d8608ad86e54951b8c8bd6c8d8416533d20) in some [index set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_set "Index set")![Image 115: {\displaystyle I}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/535ea7fc4134a31cbe2251d9d3511374bc41be9f) an element ![Image 116: {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} _{i}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/51747274b58895dd357bb270ba1b5cb71e4fa355) of ![Image 117: {\displaystyle V_{i}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f300b83673e961a9d48f3862216b167f94e5668c).[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTERoman2005ch._1,_pp._31%E2%80%9332-64) Addition and scalar multiplication is performed componentwise. A variant of this construction is the _direct sum_![Image 118: {\textstyle \bigoplus _{i\in I}V_{i}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/792fd905a6c6c21b7e00e81a0b785840edc59b2c) (also called [coproduct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coproduct "Coproduct") and denoted ![Image 119: {\textstyle \coprod _{i\in I}V_{i}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ddf46cb4bf90baee84164db1246e0018346c2df8)), where only tuples with finitely many nonzero vectors are allowed. If the index set ![Image 120: {\displaystyle I}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/535ea7fc4134a31cbe2251d9d3511374bc41be9f) is finite, the two constructions agree, but in general they are different.

The _tensor product_![Image 121: {\displaystyle V\otimes _{F}W,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/94bed517f45b4e6ecfe0df9a3862d5c895be220a) or simply ![Image 122: {\displaystyle V\otimes W,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c573e8e21370a278ec3c8f0225c1f970fe583eec) of two vector spaces ![Image 123: {\displaystyle V}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/af0f6064540e84211d0ffe4dac72098adfa52845) and ![Image 124: {\displaystyle W}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/54a9c4c547f4d6111f81946cad242b18298d70b7) is one of the central notions of [multilinear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilinear_algebra "Multilinear algebra") which deals with extending notions such as linear maps to several variables. A map ![Image 125: {\displaystyle g:V\times W\to X}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/573030f61b9c05c1a6d6f421c3a6aaf9dffe8f34) from the [Cartesian product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_product "Cartesian product")![Image 126: {\displaystyle V\times W}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6b9b65a794c51f2c6b0396c9d01d3bbe48f54fa4) is called [bilinear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilinear_map "Bilinear map") if ![Image 127: {\displaystyle g}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d3556280e66fe2c0d0140df20935a6f057381d77) is linear in both variables ![Image 128: {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/35c1866e359fbfd2e0f606c725ba5cc37a5195d6) and ![Image 129: {\displaystyle \mathbf {w} .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/eaf8a103f40a7fbdb19c7e667d92541b26cae840) That is to say, for fixed ![Image 130: {\displaystyle \mathbf {w} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/20795664b5b048744a2fd88977851104cc5816f8) the map ![Image 131: {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} \mapsto g(\mathbf {v} ,\mathbf {w} )}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0161f16d0b376773ad41a63192e7f768e921b0f9) is linear in the sense above and likewise for fixed ![Image 132: {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/403a39746fb7416e8917e81d974df3d75b710131)

Vector spaces with additional structure
---------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vector_space&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Vector spaces with additional structure")]

From the point of view of linear algebra, vector spaces are completely understood insofar as any vector space over a given field is characterized, up to isomorphism, by its dimension. However, vector spaces _per se_ do not offer a framework to deal with the question—crucial to analysis—whether a sequence of functions [converges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_of_a_sequence "Limit of a sequence") to another function. Likewise, linear algebra is not adapted to deal with [infinite series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_series "Infinite series"), since the addition operation allows only finitely many terms to be added. Therefore, the needs of [functional analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_analysis "Functional analysis") require considering additional structures.[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTERudin1991p.3-67)

A vector space may be given a [partial order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_order "Partial order")![Image 148: {\displaystyle \,\leq ,\,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d5b5304f5dfd5b1b91c2c52b32a03fc82b7f4a0f) under which some vectors can be compared.[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTESchaeferWolff1999pp._204%E2%80%93205-68) For example, ![Image 149: {\displaystyle n}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b)-dimensional real space ![Image 150: {\displaystyle \mathbf {R} ^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5ed657d7f0d7aa156e7b9b171f22b4a3aa6482c3) can be ordered by comparing its vectors componentwise. [Ordered vector spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_vector_space "Ordered vector space"), for example [Riesz spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riesz_space "Riesz space"), are fundamental to [Lebesgue integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebesgue_integration "Lebesgue integration"), which relies on the ability to express a function as a difference of two positive functions ![Image 151: {\displaystyle f=f^{+}-f^{-}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/784d56e3b9cbfaaae5e1cc982983f8eb91f56761) where ![Image 152: {\displaystyle f^{+}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1287ce7b0d53ec4a6c26a4c31f5a8f747be9ba98) denotes the positive part of ![Image 153: {\displaystyle f}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/132e57acb643253e7810ee9702d9581f159a1c61) and ![Image 154: {\displaystyle f^{-}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/86c160282cc6444329bc1a54ab6e1f6c6530c594) the negative part.[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBourbaki2004ch._2,_p._48-69)

### Normed vector spaces and inner product spaces

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vector_space&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: Normed vector spaces and inner product spaces")]

"Measuring" vectors is done by specifying a [norm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(mathematics) "Norm (mathematics)"), a datum which measures lengths of vectors, or by an [inner product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_product "Inner product"), which measures angles between vectors. Norms and inner products are denoted ![Image 155: {\displaystyle |\mathbf {v} |}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/16a779e65de92152d395f5576ce1001c8e56d7f6) and ![Image 156: {\displaystyle \langle \mathbf {v} ,\mathbf {w} \rangle ,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a4346bdf1bd9b9613acc20abb4389b6ac1d260f4) respectively. The datum of an inner product entails that lengths of vectors can be defined too, by defining the associated norm ![Image 157: {\textstyle |\mathbf {v} |:={\sqrt {\langle \mathbf {v} ,\mathbf {v} \rangle }}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/77f614a517b5cbf88c3375b1430f049c87aec79e) Vector spaces endowed with such data are known as _normed vector spaces_ and _inner product spaces_, respectively.[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTERoman2005ch._9-70)

Coordinate space ![Image 158: {\displaystyle F^{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/caeaf2cf3b94c8a21721478bcd52964068489df9) can be equipped with the standard [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product "Dot product"): ![Image 159: {\displaystyle \langle \mathbf {x} ,\mathbf {y} \rangle =\mathbf {x} \cdot \mathbf {y} =x_{1}y_{1}+\cdots +x_{n}y_{n}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/94ccff40a4dd85b183730657b9874e0de84ad2cc) In ![Image 160: {\displaystyle \mathbf {R} ^{2},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ec417570cf838238bb2d86c60d2cbfab974607cf) this reflects the common notion of the angle between two vectors ![Image 161: {\displaystyle \mathbf {x} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/32adf004df5eb0a8c7fd8c0b6b7405183c5a5ef2) and ![Image 162: {\displaystyle \mathbf {y} ,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1bcd6039f384fd6a570c06144b7fc365111eac83) by the [law of cosines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_cosines "Law of cosines"): ![Image 163: {\displaystyle \mathbf {x} \cdot \mathbf {y} =\cos \left(\angle (\mathbf {x} ,\mathbf {y} )\right)\cdot |\mathbf {x} |\cdot |\mathbf {y} |.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a3aebaa2199918778e31afd4e84b132d223dc6ce) Because of this, two vectors satisfying ![Image 164: {\displaystyle \langle \mathbf {x} ,\mathbf {y} \rangle =0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/91c94233efe3dbc09548f4716e5c44438c7ea8a0) are called [orthogonal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal "Orthogonal"). An important variant of the standard dot product is used in [Minkowski space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_space "Minkowski space"): ![Image 165: {\displaystyle \mathbf {R} ^{4}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bd186b8abaeed43c225609f9556d8ee783b6a7fd) endowed with the Lorentz product[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTENaber2003ch._1.2-71)![Image 166: {\displaystyle \langle \mathbf {x} |\mathbf {y} \rangle =x_{1}y_{1}+x_{2}y_{2}+x_{3}y_{3}-x_{4}y_{4}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0613e2ebaa3b76e545aaeeb8b8b7dfe2ddac4a89) In contrast to the standard dot product, it is not [positive definite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_definite_bilinear_form "Positive definite bilinear form"): ![Image 167: {\displaystyle \langle \mathbf {x} |\mathbf {x} \rangle }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c473743b12e418662333624c8a95e4f475e89e3e) also takes negative values, for example, for ![Image 168: {\displaystyle \mathbf {x} =(0,0,0,1).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/152aae0b6d32f1144e8839d98002c7d2778b145f) Singling out the fourth coordinate—[corresponding to time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timelike "Timelike"), as opposed to three space-dimensions—makes it useful for the mathematical treatment of [special relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity "Special relativity"). Note that in other conventions time is often written as the first, or "zeroeth" component so that the Lorentz product is written ![Image 169: {\displaystyle \langle \mathbf {x} |\mathbf {y} \rangle =-x_{0}y_{0}+x_{1}y_{1}+x_{2}y_{2}+x_{3}y_{3}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ed2585c032964a80f3534e345d38dc06d98b4a97)

### Topological vector spaces

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vector_space&action=edit&section=20 "Edit section: Topological vector spaces")]

Convergence questions are treated by considering vector spaces ![Image 170: {\displaystyle V}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/af0f6064540e84211d0ffe4dac72098adfa52845) carrying a compatible [topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space "Topological space"), a structure that allows one to talk about elements being [close to each other](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighborhood_(topology) "Neighborhood (topology)").[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTETreves1967Bourbaki1987-72) Compatible here means that addition and scalar multiplication have to be [continuous maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_map "Continuous map"). Roughly, if ![Image 171: {\displaystyle \mathbf {x} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/32adf004df5eb0a8c7fd8c0b6b7405183c5a5ef2) and ![Image 172: {\displaystyle \mathbf {y} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bb25a040b592282dc2a254c3117e792c3c81161f) in ![Image 173: {\displaystyle V}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/af0f6064540e84211d0ffe4dac72098adfa52845), and ![Image 174: {\displaystyle a}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ffd2487510aa438433a2579450ab2b3d557e5edc) in ![Image 175: {\displaystyle F}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/545fd099af8541605f7ee55f08225526be88ce57) vary by a bounded amount, then so do ![Image 176: {\displaystyle \mathbf {x} +\mathbf {y} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/489fe3f87c1bac975b1bdea1a3e7b0369d8f7a08) and ![Image 177: {\displaystyle a\mathbf {x} .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ecda72965b1e05af5802cb3ac8cf540ff513397e)[[nb 6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-73) To make sense of specifying the amount a scalar changes, the field ![Image 178: {\displaystyle F}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/545fd099af8541605f7ee55f08225526be88ce57) also has to carry a topology in this context; a common choice is the reals or the complex numbers.

In such _topological vector spaces_ one can consider [series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_(mathematics) "Series (mathematics)") of vectors. The [infinite sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_sum "Infinite sum")![Image 179: {\displaystyle \sum _{i=1}^{\infty }f_{i}~=~\lim _{n\to \infty }f_{1}+\cdots +f_{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/49332ebd615bf4140938529f15b3ed01e1b10513) denotes the [limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_of_a_sequence "Limit of a sequence") of the corresponding finite partial sums of the sequence ![Image 180: {\displaystyle f_{1},f_{2},\ldots }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8014204900bd325a7519524aff99e3dc8114fd8f) of elements of ![Image 181: {\displaystyle V.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1b2661a49b86bd1a5548e527bbfb068aa9f59978) For example, the ![Image 182: {\displaystyle f_{i}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/65da883ca3d16b461e46c94777b0d9c4aa010e79) could be (real or complex) functions belonging to some [function space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_space "Function space")![Image 183: {\displaystyle V,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ace9595e3ce66fdec7e9d30202626accd676b11e) in which case the series is a [function series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_series "Function series"). The [mode of convergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modes_of_convergence "Modes of convergence") of the series depends on the topology imposed on the function space. In such cases, [pointwise convergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointwise_convergence "Pointwise convergence") and [uniform convergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_convergence "Uniform convergence") are two prominent examples.[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTESchaeferWolff1999p._7-74)

A way to ensure the existence of limits of certain infinite series is to restrict attention to spaces where any [Cauchy sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy_sequence "Cauchy sequence") has a limit; such a vector space is called [complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Completeness_(topology) "Completeness (topology)"). Roughly, a vector space is complete provided that it contains all necessary limits. For example, the vector space of polynomials on the unit interval ![Image 189: {\displaystyle [0,1],}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/971caee396752d8bf56711f55d2c3b1207d4a236) equipped with the [topology of uniform convergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology_of_uniform_convergence "Topology of uniform convergence") is not complete because any continuous function on ![Image 190: {\displaystyle [0,1]}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/738f7d23bb2d9642bab520020873cccbef49768d) can be uniformly approximated by a sequence of polynomials, by the [Weierstrass approximation theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weierstrass_approximation_theorem "Weierstrass approximation theorem").[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-75) In contrast, the space of _all_ continuous functions on ![Image 191: {\displaystyle [0,1]}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/738f7d23bb2d9642bab520020873cccbef49768d) with the same topology is complete.[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-76) A norm gives rise to a topology by defining that a sequence of vectors ![Image 192: {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} _{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/05afff3073235a1f9b61144677764d1e3bda26f1) converges to ![Image 193: {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/35c1866e359fbfd2e0f606c725ba5cc37a5195d6) if and only if ![Image 194: {\displaystyle \lim _{n\to \infty }|\mathbf {v} _{n}-\mathbf {v} |=0.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/df0483d6124c00638b669967171f5883444ea222) Banach and Hilbert spaces are complete topological vector spaces whose topologies are given, respectively, by a norm and an inner product. Their study—a key piece of [functional analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_analysis "Functional analysis")—focuses on infinite-dimensional vector spaces, since all norms on finite-dimensional topological vector spaces give rise to the same notion of convergence.[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChoquet1966Proposition_III.7.2-77) The image at the right shows the equivalence of the ![Image 195: {\displaystyle 1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/92d98b82a3778f043108d4e20960a9193df57cbf)-norm and ![Image 196: {\displaystyle \infty }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c26c105004f30c27aa7c2a9c601550a4183b1f21)-norm on ![Image 197: {\displaystyle \mathbf {R} ^{2}:}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/05b5ce0ea8c16d0902300c6a7081bd5aadef39f0) as the unit "balls" enclose each other, a sequence converges to zero in one norm if and only if it so does in the other norm. In the infinite-dimensional case, however, there will generally be inequivalent topologies, which makes the study of topological vector spaces richer than that of vector spaces without additional data.

From a conceptual point of view, all notions related to topological vector spaces should match the topology. For example, instead of considering all linear maps (also called [functionals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_(mathematics) "Functional (mathematics)")) ![Image 198: {\displaystyle V\to W,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/52495bce078acc6cd5620da0a6da461fb6282f42) maps between topological vector spaces are required to be continuous.[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTETreves1967p._34%E2%80%9336-78) In particular, the (topological) dual space ![Image 199: {\displaystyle V^{*}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5910e6a94f4f7ee2ee85ceed9dacef3eff7a6242) consists of continuous functionals ![Image 200: {\displaystyle V\to \mathbf {R} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/30534e02fed26a26f80c4b15146efd1d141038a1) (or to ![Image 201: {\displaystyle \mathbf {C} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/11de80478fce9090e43eed19100b37cc841661e8)). The fundamental [Hahn–Banach theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hahn%E2%80%93Banach_theorem "Hahn–Banach theorem") is concerned with separating subspaces of appropriate topological vector spaces by continuous functionals.[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTELang1983Cor._4.1.2,_p._69-79)

_[Banach spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach\_space "Banach space")_, introduced by [Stefan Banach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Banach "Stefan Banach"), are complete normed vector spaces.[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTETreves1967ch._11-80)

These spaces are complete.[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTETreves1967Theorem_11.2,_p._102-82) (If one uses the [Riemann integral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_integral "Riemann integral") instead, the space is _not_ complete, which may be seen as a justification for Lebesgue's integration theory.[[nb 8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-83)) Concretely this means that for any sequence of Lebesgue-integrable functions ![Image 223: {\displaystyle f_{1},f_{2},\ldots ,f_{n},\ldots }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b9308903d6794c2e017f99ed5f3719c87cde17e0) with ![Image 224: {\displaystyle \|f_{n}\|_{p}<\infty ,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5492677d1c54ef2d39eb57059acbf1588c171f4e) satisfying the condition ![Image 225: {\displaystyle \lim _{k,\ n\to \infty }\int _{\Omega }\left|f_{k}(x)-f_{n}(x)\right|^{p}\,{d\mu (x)}=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e9eece866e9462537619272b3fd0349a04835f58) there exists a function ![Image 226: {\displaystyle f(x)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/202945cce41ecebb6f643f31d119c514bec7a074) belonging to the vector space ![Image 227: {\displaystyle L^{\;\!p}(\Omega )}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/db5a307f1bc9608c0233ef940dfeb0b4b9a3bef2) such that ![Image 228: {\displaystyle \lim _{k\to \infty }\int _{\Omega }\left|f(x)-f_{k}(x)\right|^{p}\,{d\mu (x)}=0.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ed839d6a155ecea58d76d1a88a96454d47e00dba)

Imposing boundedness conditions not only on the function, but also on its [derivatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative "Derivative") leads to [Sobolev spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobolev_space "Sobolev space").[[76]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTEEvans1998ch._5-84)

Complete inner product spaces are known as _Hilbert spaces_, in honor of [David Hilbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hilbert "David Hilbert").[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTETreves1967ch._12-85) The Hilbert space ![Image 230: {\displaystyle L^{2}(\Omega ),}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ebd00f5ffc32ce32b622d28467b3796998859ca4) with inner product given by ![Image 231: {\displaystyle \langle f\ ,\ g\rangle =\int _{\Omega }f(x){\overline {g(x)}}\,dx,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bdcbee430122d5256abe43e80315dccef1cd5806) where ![Image 232: {\displaystyle {\overline {g(x)}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5f968b7527fcc59e6aac917588d3d4c81b915828) denotes the [complex conjugate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_conjugate "Complex conjugate") of ![Image 233: {\displaystyle g(x),}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8c36278728763484856f51a229bf8ce5e592e61e)[[78]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDenneryKrzywicki1996p.190-86)[[nb 9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-87) is a key case.

By definition, in a Hilbert space, any Cauchy sequence converges to a limit. Conversely, finding a sequence of functions ![Image 234: {\displaystyle f_{n}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b2702450f0458a5e01a698e248af552a7fab2b50) with desirable properties that approximate a given limit function is equally crucial. Early analysis, in the guise of the [Taylor approximation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_approximation "Taylor approximation"), established an approximation of [differentiable functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_function "Differentiable function")![Image 235: {\displaystyle f}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/132e57acb643253e7810ee9702d9581f159a1c61) by polynomials.[[79]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTELang1993Th._XIII.6,_p._349-88) By the [Stone–Weierstrass theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone%E2%80%93Weierstrass_theorem "Stone–Weierstrass theorem"), every continuous function on ![Image 236: {\displaystyle [a,b]}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9c4b788fc5c637e26ee98b45f89a5c08c85f7935) can be approximated as closely as desired by a polynomial.[[80]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTELang1993Th._III.1.1-89) A similar approximation technique by [trigonometric functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometric_function "Trigonometric function") is commonly called [Fourier expansion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_expansion "Fourier expansion"), and is much applied in engineering. More generally, and more conceptually, the theorem yields a simple description of what "basic functions", or, in abstract Hilbert spaces, what basic vectors suffice to generate a Hilbert space ![Image 237: {\displaystyle H,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ef601e1519093ba6c2944b945882c119f990e704) in the sense that the _[closure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure\_(topology) "Closure (topology)")_ of their span (that is, finite linear combinations and limits of those) is the whole space. Such a set of functions is called a _basis_ of ![Image 238: {\displaystyle H,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ef601e1519093ba6c2944b945882c119f990e704) its cardinality is known as the [Hilbert space dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_space_dimension "Hilbert space dimension").[[nb 10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-90) Not only does the theorem exhibit suitable basis functions as sufficient for approximation purposes, but also together with the [Gram–Schmidt process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram%E2%80%93Schmidt_process "Gram–Schmidt process"), it enables one to construct a [basis of orthogonal vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_basis "Orthogonal basis").[[81]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChoquet1966Lemma_III.16.11-91) Such orthogonal bases are the Hilbert space generalization of the coordinate axes in finite-dimensional [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space").

The solutions to various [differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation "Differential equation") can be interpreted in terms of Hilbert spaces. For example, a great many fields in physics and engineering lead to such equations, and frequently solutions with particular physical properties are used as basis functions, often orthogonal.[[82]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKreyszig1999Chapter_11-92) As an example from physics, the time-dependent [Schrödinger equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation "Schrödinger equation") in [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics") describes the change of physical properties in time by means of a [partial differential equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation "Partial differential equation"), whose solutions are called [wavefunctions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefunction "Wavefunction").[[83]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGriffiths1995Chapter_1-93) Definite values for physical properties such as energy, or momentum, correspond to [eigenvalues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalue "Eigenvalue") of a certain (linear) [differential operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_operator "Differential operator") and the associated wavefunctions are called [eigenstates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenstate "Eigenstate"). The [spectral theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_theorem "Spectral theorem") decomposes a linear [compact operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_operator "Compact operator") acting on functions in terms of these eigenfunctions and their eigenvalues.[[84]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTELang1993ch._XVII.3-94)

General vector spaces do not possess a multiplication between vectors. A vector space equipped with an additional [bilinear operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilinear_operator "Bilinear operator") defining the multiplication of two vectors is an _algebra over a field_ (or _F_-algebra if the field _F_ is specified).[[85]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTELang2002ch._III.1,_p._121-95)

For example, the set of all [polynomials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial "Polynomial")![Image 243: {\displaystyle p(t)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9b827c545ca1487214f0c498131228ef87718ece) forms an algebra known as the [polynomial ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_ring "Polynomial ring"): using that the sum of two polynomials is a polynomial, they form a vector space; they form an algebra since the product of two polynomials is again a polynomial. Rings of polynomials (in several variables) and their [quotients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotient_ring "Quotient ring") form the basis of [algebraic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry "Algebraic geometry"), because they are [rings of functions of algebraic geometric objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_ring "Coordinate ring").[[86]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTEEisenbud1995ch._1.6-96)

Another crucial example are _[Lie algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie\_algebra "Lie algebra")_, which are neither commutative nor associative, but the failure to be so is limited by the constraints (![Image 244: {\displaystyle [x,y]}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1b7bd6292c6023626c6358bfd3943a031b27d663) denotes the product of ![Image 245: {\displaystyle x}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/87f9e315fd7e2ba406057a97300593c4802b53e4) and ![Image 246: {\displaystyle y}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b8a6208ec717213d4317e666f1ae872e00620a0d)):

The [tensor algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_algebra "Tensor algebra")![Image 251: {\displaystyle \operatorname {T} (V)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c18b68545f38e49986804a0e9facad8a7db9ea29) is a formal way of adding products to any vector space ![Image 252: {\displaystyle V}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/af0f6064540e84211d0ffe4dac72098adfa52845) to obtain an algebra.[[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTELang2002ch._XVI.7-98) As a vector space, it is spanned by symbols, called simple [tensors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor "Tensor")![Image 253: {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} _{1}\otimes \mathbf {v} _{2}\otimes \cdots \otimes \mathbf {v} _{n},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4d7f6e265a3024dcfc8a771a92f260398aba680e) where the [degree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rank_of_a_tensor "Rank of a tensor")![Image 254: {\displaystyle n}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b) varies. The multiplication is given by concatenating such symbols, imposing the [distributive law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributive_law "Distributive law") under addition, and requiring that scalar multiplication commute with the tensor product ⊗, much the same way as with the tensor product of two vector spaces introduced in the above section on [tensor products](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#Tensor_product). In general, there are no relations between ![Image 255: {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} _{1}\otimes \mathbf {v} _{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f733cf6f632a3c41f6cce290f8b45d87eeb759e4) and ![Image 256: {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} _{2}\otimes \mathbf {v} _{1}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1b779275d5e22fe962bc90e03258394d2ae321f5) Forcing two such elements to be equal leads to the [symmetric algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_algebra "Symmetric algebra"), whereas forcing ![Image 257: {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} _{1}\otimes \mathbf {v} _{2}=-\mathbf {v} _{2}\otimes \mathbf {v} _{1}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e33f11b00aaa607716f42fda09c86cdfc2863918) yields the [exterior algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exterior_algebra "Exterior algebra").[[89]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTELang2002ch._XVI.8-99)

A _vector bundle_ is a family of vector spaces parametrized continuously by a [topological space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space "Topological space")_X_.[[90]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTESpivak1999ch._3-100) More precisely, a vector bundle over _X_ is a topological space _E_ equipped with a continuous map ![Image 259: {\displaystyle \pi :E\to X}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ebbf8de3c25d0905f50abaf4f9374daa0a4bd796) such that for every _x_ in _X_, the [fiber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber_(mathematics) "Fiber (mathematics)") π−1(_x_) is a vector space. The case dim _V_ = 1 is called a [line bundle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_bundle "Line bundle"). For any vector space _V_, the projection _X_ × _V_ → _X_ makes the product _X_ × _V_ into a ["trivial" vector bundle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trivial_bundle "Trivial bundle"). Vector bundles over _X_ are required to be [locally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locally "Locally") a product of _X_ and some (fixed) vector space _V_: for every _x_ in _X_, there is a [neighborhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighborhood_(topology) "Neighborhood (topology)")_U_ of _x_ such that the restriction of π to π−1(_U_) is isomorphic[[nb 11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-101) to the trivial bundle _U_ × _V_ → _U_. Despite their locally trivial character, vector bundles may (depending on the shape of the underlying space _X_) be "twisted" in the large (that is, the bundle need not be (globally isomorphic to) the trivial bundle _X_ × _V_). For example, the [Möbius strip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6bius_strip "Möbius strip") can be seen as a line bundle over the circle _S_ 1 (by [identifying open intervals with the real line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeomorphism#Examples "Homeomorphism")). It is, however, different from the [cylinder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylinder_(geometry) "Cylinder (geometry)")_S_ 1 × **R**, because the latter is [orientable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientable_manifold "Orientable manifold") whereas the former is not.[[91]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKreyszig1991%C2%A734,_p._108-102)

Properties of certain vector bundles provide information about the underlying topological space. For example, the [tangent bundle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_bundle "Tangent bundle") consists of the collection of [tangent spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_space "Tangent space") parametrized by the points of a differentiable manifold. The tangent bundle of the circle _S_ 1 is globally isomorphic to _S_ 1 × **R**, since there is a global nonzero [vector field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_field "Vector field") on _S_ 1.[[nb 12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-103) In contrast, by the [hairy ball theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hairy_ball_theorem "Hairy ball theorem"), there is no (tangent) vector field on the [2-sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2-sphere "2-sphere")_S_ 2 which is everywhere nonzero.[[92]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTEEisenbergGuy1979-104)[K-theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-theory "K-theory") studies the isomorphism classes of all vector bundles over some topological space.[[93]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAtiyah1989-105) In addition to deepening topological and geometrical insight, it has purely algebraic consequences, such as the classification of finite-dimensional real [division algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_algebra "Division algebra"): **R**, **C**, the [quaternions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion "Quaternion")**H** and the [octonions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octonion "Octonion")**O**.

The [cotangent bundle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotangent_bundle "Cotangent bundle") of a differentiable manifold consists, at every point of the manifold, of the dual of the tangent space, the [cotangent space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotangent_space "Cotangent space"). [Sections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_(fiber_bundle) "Section (fiber bundle)") of that bundle are known as [differential one-forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_form "Differential form").

_Modules_ are to [rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_(mathematics) "Ring (mathematics)") what vector spaces are to fields: the same axioms, applied to a ring _R_ instead of a field _F_, yield modules.[[94]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTEArtin1991ch._12-106) The theory of modules, compared to that of vector spaces, is complicated by the presence of ring elements that do not have [multiplicative inverses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicative_inverse "Multiplicative inverse"). For example, modules need not have bases, as the **Z**-module (that is, [abelian group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelian_group "Abelian group")) [**Z**/2**Z**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_arithmetic "Modular arithmetic") shows; those modules that do (including all vector spaces) are known as [free modules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_module "Free module"). Nevertheless, a vector space can be compactly defined as a [module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Module_(mathematics) "Module (mathematics)") over a [ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_(mathematics) "Ring (mathematics)") which is a [field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics) "Field (mathematics)"), with the elements being called vectors. Some authors use the term _vector space_ to mean modules over a [division ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_ring "Division ring").[[95]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGrillet2007-107) The algebro-geometric interpretation of commutative rings via their [spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum_of_a_ring "Spectrum of a ring") allows the development of concepts such as [locally free modules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locally_free_module "Locally free module"), the algebraic counterpart to vector bundles.

### Affine and projective spaces

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vector_space&action=edit&section=27 "Edit section: Affine and projective spaces")]

[![Image 260](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/Affine_subspace.svg/200px-Affine_subspace.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Affine_subspace.svg)

An [affine plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_space "Affine space") (light blue) in **R**3. It is a two-dimensional subspace shifted by a vector **x** (red).

Roughly, _affine spaces_ are vector spaces whose origins are not specified.[[96]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMeyer2000Example_5.13.5,_p._436-108) More precisely, an affine space is a set with a [free transitive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitive_group_action "Transitive group action") vector space [action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_action_(mathematics) "Group action (mathematics)"). In particular, a vector space is an affine space over itself, by the map ![Image 261: {\displaystyle V\times V\to W,\;(\mathbf {v} ,\mathbf {a} )\mapsto \mathbf {a} +\mathbf {v} .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ef057e61ae7876a1608903d32ac488ca66098f30) If _W_ is a vector space, then an affine subspace is a subset of _W_ obtained by translating a linear subspace _V_ by a fixed vector **x** ∈ _W_; this space is denoted by **x** + _V_ (it is a [coset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coset "Coset") of _V_ in _W_) and consists of all vectors of the form **x** + **v** for **v** ∈ _V_. An important example is the space of solutions of a system of inhomogeneous linear equations ![Image 262: {\displaystyle A\mathbf {v} =\mathbf {b} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/daadc740034404157c9a8aeccc90455db9c8bedd) generalizing the homogeneous case discussed in the [above section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#equation3) on linear equations, which can be found by setting ![Image 263: {\displaystyle \mathbf {b} =\mathbf {0} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4cdf97ca5b695e4defc6395e07c3148e7e7d1af0) in this equation.[[97]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMeyer2000Exercise_5.13.15%E2%80%9317,_p._442-109) The space of solutions is the affine subspace **x** + _V_ where **x** is a particular solution of the equation, and _V_ is the space of solutions of the homogeneous equation (the [nullspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nullspace "Nullspace") of _A_).

The set of one-dimensional subspaces of a fixed finite-dimensional vector space _V_ is known as _projective space_; it may be used to formalize the idea of [parallel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_(geometry) "Parallel (geometry)") lines intersecting at infinity.[[98]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTECoxeter1987-110)[Grassmannians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassmannian_manifold "Grassmannian manifold") and [flag manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_manifold "Flag manifold") generalize this by parametrizing linear subspaces of fixed dimension _k_ and [flags](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_(linear_algebra) "Flag (linear algebra)") of subspaces, respectively.

1.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_ref-1)**It is also common, especially in physics, to denote vectors with an arrow on top: ![Image 264: {\displaystyle {\vec {v}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a5548bdd4889d2a7931f2478b38dded1fa898eff) It is also common, especially in higher mathematics, to not use any typographical method for distinguishing vectors from other mathematical objects.
2.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_ref-4)**Scalar multiplication is not to be confused with the [scalar product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_product "Scalar product"), which is an additional operation on some specific vector spaces, called [inner product spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_product_space "Inner product space"). Scalar multiplication is the multiplication of a vector _by_ a scalar that produces a vector, while the scalar product is a multiplication of two vectors that produces a scalar.
3.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_ref-6)**This axiom is not an [associative property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_property "Associative property"), since it refers to two different operations, scalar multiplication and field multiplication. So, it is independent from the associativity of field multiplication, which is assumed by field axioms.
4.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_ref-55)**This is typically the case when a vector space is also considered as an [affine space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_space "Affine space"). In this case, a linear subspace contains the [zero vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_vector "Zero vector"), while an affine subspace does not necessarily contain it.
5.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_ref-59)**Some authors, such as [Roman (2005)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#CITEREFRoman2005), choose to start with this [equivalence relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_relation "Equivalence relation") and derive the concrete shape of ![Image 265: {\displaystyle V/W}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/74f0444abe38d7c9392ba2cfd13031b0f3d39cac) from this.
6.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_ref-73)**This requirement implies that the topology gives rise to a [uniform structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_structure "Uniform structure"), [Bourbaki (1989)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#CITEREFBourbaki1989), loc = ch. II.
7.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_ref-81)**The [triangle inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_inequality "Triangle inequality") for ![Image 266: {\displaystyle \|f+g\|_{p}\leq \|f\|_{p}+\|g\|_{p}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a1d3de762058656808721fc899c4b223914c6c3f) is provided by the [Minkowski inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_inequality "Minkowski inequality"). For technical reasons, in the context of functions one has to identify functions that agree [almost everywhere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almost_everywhere "Almost everywhere") to get a norm, and not only a [seminorm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seminorm "Seminorm").
8.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_ref-83)** "Many functions in ![Image 267: {\displaystyle L^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ba162c66ca85776c83557af5088cc6f8584d1912) of Lebesgue measure, being unbounded, cannot be integrated with the classical Riemann integral. So spaces of Riemann integrable functions would not be complete in the ![Image 268: {\displaystyle L^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ba162c66ca85776c83557af5088cc6f8584d1912) norm, and the orthogonal decomposition would not apply to them. This shows one of the advantages of Lebesgue integration.", [Dudley (1989)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#CITEREFDudley1989), §5.3, p. 125.
9.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_ref-87)**For ![Image 269: {\displaystyle p\neq 2,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/90cba96ef7df9709447abd7664755985c17d00ed)![Image 270: {\displaystyle L^{p}(\Omega )}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5b1ecf636f78aa6950ffe35ed4723bea9d8ca331) is not a Hilbert space.
10.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_ref-90)**A basis of a Hilbert space is not the same thing as a basis of a linear algebra. For distinction, a linear algebra basis for a Hilbert space is called a [Hamel basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamel_basis "Hamel basis").
11.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_ref-101)**That is, there is a [homeomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeomorphism "Homeomorphism") from π−1(_U_) to _V_ × _U_ which restricts to linear isomorphisms between fibers.
12.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#cite_ref-103)**A line bundle, such as the tangent bundle of _S_ 1 is trivial if and only if there is a [section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_(fiber_bundle) "Section (fiber bundle)") that vanishes nowhere, see [Husemoller (1994)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#CITEREFHusemoller1994), Corollary 8.3. The sections of the tangent bundle are just [vector fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_field "Vector field").
