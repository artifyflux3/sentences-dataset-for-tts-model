The Eiffel Tower was built by Gustave Eiffel.

The series was painted in an emerging Orphist style, an art movement co-founded by Robert and Sonia Delaunay and František Kupka that added bright colors and increased abstraction to Cubism . The Eiffel Tower series sits chronologically and stylistically between the artist's Saint-Séverin series and Windows series.

Guggenheim Museum Legacy [ edit ] Delaunay's Eiffel Tower series is evoked in architectural paintings of other iconic buildings by his contemporary, the New York artist John Marin , in his Woolworth Building, No. 31 of 1912, [ 2 ] and later by the Ontario artist Greg Curnoe 's CN Tower series of the 1970s and 1980s.

[ 3 ] The 1913 artist's book La prose du Transsibérien et de la Petite Jehanne de France , a collaborative work between Sonia Delaunay and the poet Blaise Cendrars , forms an epic narrative of a Trans-Siberian Railway journey that concludes in Paris at a Simultanist Eiffel Tower. They had announced a plan to sell 150 copies of the book, which would equal in height the Tower itself.

[ 4 ] The Russian film director Sergei Eisenstein 's appreciation of Delaunay's work informed his Soviet montage theory , as he imagined developing cinematically "a dynamic fusion of a series, moving past the spectator, of those hundred views of the Eiffel Tower" rather than a "summation within a single canvas".

[ 5 ] Cendrars's 1924 essay on Robert Delaunay describes his feminization of the Tower, and Sonia Delaunay described the Eiffel Tower as her husband's "Eve future" [ 6 ] A 1911 painting from the series is featured in the 1980 BBC series 100 Great Paintings .
