[ 10 ] Established in 1885, it has the largest student enrollment of the University System of Georgia institutions and satellite campuses in Savannah, Georgia , and Metz, France .

[ 11 ] The school was founded as the Georgia School of Technology as part of Reconstruction efforts to build an industrial economy in the Southern United States after the Civil War . Initially, it offered only a degree in mechanical engineering. By 1901, its curriculum had expanded to include electrical, civil, and chemical engineering. In 1948, the school changed its name to reflect its evolution from a trade school to a technical institute and research university . Georgia Tech is organized into seven colleges with about 31 departments and academic units. It emphasizes the academic fields of science and technology. Georgia Tech's $5.3 billion economic impact for fiscal year 2023 led all public institutions in the state.

[ 12 ] Georgia Tech fields eight men's and seven women's sports teams; these compete in NCAA Division I athletics and have won five national championships. The university is a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference .

History [ edit ] Main article: History of Georgia Tech Establishment [ edit ] Atlanta during the Civil War, c.

1864 The idea of a technology school in Georgia was introduced in 1865 during the Reconstruction period. Two former Confederate officers, Major John Fletcher Hanson (an industrialist) and Nathaniel Edwin Harris (a politician and eventually Governor of Georgia), who had become prominent citizens in the town of Macon, Georgia , after the Civil War , believed that the South needed to improve its technology to compete with the North's industrialization .

[ 13 ] [ 14 ] Because the American South of that era was mainly populated by agricultural workers and few technical developments were occurring, they proposed to establish a technology school.

[ 13 ] [ 14 ] In 1882, the Georgia State Legislature authorized a committee, led by Harris, to visit the Northeast to learn how technology schools worked. They were impressed by the polytechnic educational models developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Worcester County Free Institute of Industrial Science (now Worcester Polytechnic Institute ). The committee recommended adapting the Worcester model, which stressed a combination of "theory and practice", the "practice" component including student employment and production of consumer items to generate revenue for the school.

[ 15 ] On October 13, 1885, Georgia Governor Henry D. McDaniel signed the bill to create and fund the new school.

[ 1 ] In 1887, Atlanta pioneer Richard Peters donated to the state 4 acres (1.6 ha) of the site of a failed garden suburb called Peters Park . The site was bounded on the south by North Avenue , and on the west by Cherry Street.

[ 1 ] He then sold five adjoining acres of land to the state for US$ 10,000, (equivalent to $350,000 in 2024).

[ 1 ] This land was near Atlanta's northern city limits at the time of its founding, although the city has since expanded several miles beyond it. A historical marker on the large hill in Central Campus says that the site occupied by the school's first buildings once held fortifications to protect Atlanta during the Atlanta Campaign of the American Civil War.

[ 16 ] The surrender of the city took place in 1864 on what is today the southwestern boundary of the Georgia Tech campus.

[ 17 ] Early years [ edit ] An early picture of Georgia Tech, circa 1899 The Georgia School of Technology opened in the fall of 1888 with two buildings.

[ 13 ] One building (now Tech Tower , an administrative headquarters) had classrooms to teach students; The second building featured a shop and had a foundry , forge , boiler room , and engine room. It was designed for students to work and produce goods to sell and fund the school. The two buildings were equal in size to show the importance of teaching both the mind and the hands, though, at the time, there was some disagreement to whether the machine shop should have been used to turn a profit.

[ 13 ] [ 15 ] On October 20, 1905, U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt visited Georgia Tech. On the steps of Tech Tower, Roosevelt delivered a speech about the importance of technological education.

[ 18 ] He then shook hands with every student.

[ 19 ] Georgia Tech's Evening School of Commerce began holding classes in 1912.

[ 20 ] The evening school admitted its first female student in 1917, although the state legislature did not officially authorize attendance by women until 1920.

[ 20 ] [ 21 ] Annie T. Wise became the first female graduate in 1919 and was Georgia Tech's first female faculty member the following year.

[ 20 ] [ 21 ] In 1931, the Board of Regents transferred control of the Evening School of Commerce to the University of Georgia (UGA) and moved the civil and electrical engineering courses at UGA to Tech.

[ 20 ] [ 21 ] Tech replaced the commerce school with what later became the College of Business . The commerce school would later split from UGA and eventually become Georgia State University .

[ 20 ] [ 22 ] In 1934, the Engineering Experiment Station (later known as the Georgia Tech Research Institute ) was founded by W. Harry Vaughan with an initial budget of $5,000 (equivalent to $117,525 in 2024) and 13 part-time faculty.

[ 23 ] [ 24 ] In the mid to late 40s, President Blake Van Leer had a focus on making Georgia Tech the " MIT of the South." [ 25 ] Van Leer lobbied government and business for funds for new facilities. The Research Building was expanded, and a $300,000 (equivalent to $4,000,000 in 2024) Westinghouse A-C network calculator was given to Georgia Tech by Georgia Power in 1947.

[ 26 ] A new $2,000,000 library was completed, new Textile and Architecture buildings completed and at the time the most modern gymnasium in the world was built.

[ 27 ] Modern history [ edit ] Founded as the Georgia School of Technology, Georgia Tech assumed its present name in 1948 to reflect a growing focus on advanced technological and scientific research.

[ 28 ] Former Georgia Tech President G. Wayne Clough speaks at a student meeting.

Under President Blake Ragsdale Van Leer 's tenure, Tech went through a significant change, expanded its campus with new facilities, added new engineering courses, and became the largest engineering institute in the South and the third largest in the US.

[ 29 ] The first Ph.D.

was awarded in 1950 in electrical engineering . Van Leer also admitted the first female students to regular classes in 1952 and began steps toward integration.

[ 30 ] He stood up to Georgia governor Marvin Griffin 's demand to bar Bobby Grier from participating in the 1956 Sugar Bowl game between Georgia Tech and Grier's University of Pittsburgh .

[ 31 ] After Van Leer's death, his wife Ella Lillian Wall Van Leer bought a house on campus and opened it to female students to support their success. She also set up the first sorority on campus along with a Society of Women Engineers chapter.

[ 32 ] In 1968 women could enroll in all programs at Tech.

[ 33 ] Industrial Management was the last program to open to women.

[ 20 ] [ 33 ] The first women's dorm, Fulmer Hall, opened in 1969.

[ 20 ] Rena Faye Smith, appointed as a research assistant in the School of Physics in 1969 by Dr. Ray Young, in X-Ray Diffraction, became the first female faculty member (research) in the School of Physics. She went on to earn a Ph.D. at Georgia State University and taught physics and instructional technology at Black Hills State University – 1997–2005 as Rena Faye Norby. She served as a Fulbright Scholar in Russia 2004–2005.

[ 34 ] Women constituted 30.3% of the undergraduates and 25.3% of the graduate students enrolled in Spring 2009.

[ 35 ] In 1959, a meeting of 2,741 students voted by an overwhelming majority to endorse integration of qualified applicants, regardless of race.

[ 36 ] In September 1961, nine months after the University of Georgia's violent integration , [ 37 ] Ralph A. Long Jr., Lawrence Williams, and Ford C. Greene enrolled at Tech, becoming the first African American students at Tech.

Ronald Yancey enrolled the next year and in 1965 became the university's first African American graduate.

[ 38 ] Georgia Tech became the first university in the Deep South to desegregate without a court order.

[ 36 ] [ 39 ] [ 40 ] In the 1967–68 academic year 28 students out of 7,526 were black. In 1968, William Peace became the first black instructor and Marle Carter became the first black member of the homecoming court.

[ 36 ] In 1964, Dr.

Calvin Huey became the first black player to play at Grant Field when he took the field for Navy .

[ 41 ] The first black person to play for Georgia Tech was Eddie McAshan in 1970.

[ 42 ] Similarly, there was little student reaction at Georgia Tech to the Vietnam War and United States involvement in the Cambodian Civil War . The student council defeated a resolution supporting the Vietnam Moratorium , and the extent of the Tech community's response to the Kent State shooting was limited to a student-organized memorial service, though the institute was ordered closed for two days, along with all other University System of Georgia schools.

[ 23 ] In 1988, President John Patrick Crecine pushed through a restructuring of the university. The institute at that point had three colleges: the College of Engineering , the College of Management , and the catch-all COSALS, the College of Sciences and Liberal Arts. Crecine reorganized the latter two into the College of Computing , the College of Sciences , and the Ivan Allen College of Management, Policy, and International Affairs.

[ 43 ] [ 44 ] Crecine never asked for input regarding the changes and, consequently, many faculty members disliked his top-down management style; despite this, the changes passed by a slim margin.

[ 43 ] Crecine was also instrumental in securing the 1996 Summer Olympics for Atlanta. A large amount of construction occurred, creating most of what is now considered "West Campus" for Tech to serve as the Olympic Village , and significantly gentrifying Midtown Atlanta .

[ 45 ] [ 46 ] The Undergraduate Living Center, Fourth Street Apartments, Sixth Street Apartments, Eighth Street Apartments , Hemphill Apartments (now named Crecine Apartments ), and Center Street Apartments housed athletes and journalists. The Georgia Tech Aquatic Center was built for swimming events, and the Alexander Memorial Coliseum was renovated.

[ 20 ] [ 46 ] The institute also erected the Kessler Campanile and fountain to serve as a landmark and symbol of the university on television broadcasts.

[ 20 ] The Kessler Campanile seen from the Georgia Tech Student Center.

In 1994, G. Wayne Clough became the first Georgia Tech alumnus to serve as the president of institution; he was in office during the 1996 Summer Olympics. In 1998, he separated the Ivan Allen College of Management, Policy, and International Affairs into the Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts and returned the College of Management to "College" status (Crecine, the previous president, had demoted Management from "College" to "School" status as part of a controversial 1990 reorganization plan).

[ 43 ] [ 44 ] His tenure focused on a dramatic expansion of the institute, a revamped Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program, and the creation of an International Plan.

[ 47 ] [ 48 ] [ 49 ] On March 15, 2008, he was appointed secretary of the Smithsonian Institution , effective July 1, 2008.

[ 50 ] Dr. Gary Schuster , Tech's provost and executive vice president for Academic Affairs, was named interim president, effective July 1, 2008.

[ 51 ] On April 1, 2009, G. P. "Bud" Peterson , previously the chancellor of the University of Colorado at Boulder , became the 11th president of Georgia Tech.

[ 52 ] On April 20, 2010, Georgia Tech was invited to join the Association of American Universities , the first new member institution in nine years.

[ 53 ] In 2014, Georgia Tech launched the first "massive online open degree" in computer science by partnering with Udacity and AT&T; a complete degree through that program costs students $7,000.

[ 54 ] [ 55 ] [ 56 ] It eventually expanded this program with its online masters in analytics in January 2017, as well as providing the option for advanced credits with a MicroMasters in collaboration with edX .

[ 57 ] On January 7, 2019, President G.P. Bud Peterson announced his intention to retire.

[ 58 ] Angel Cabrera , former President of George Mason University and Georgia Tech alum, was named his successor on June 13, 2019. Cabrera took office on September 3, 2019.

[ 59 ] Campus sections [ edit ] Main article: Georgia Tech main campus Georgia Tech's East Campus and Central Campus as seen from an elevated point near Peachtree Street and North Avenue .

Bobby Dodd Stadium is in the foreground, Tech Tower and Junior's Grill are in the background to the left, and the Georgia Tech Campus Recreation Center is in the background and to the right.

The Varsity is in the immediate foreground between the viewer and Bobby Dodd Stadium.

The Georgia Tech campus is located in Midtown, an area slightly north of downtown Atlanta . Although a number of skyscrapers—most visibly the headquarters of The Coca-Cola Company , and Bank of America —are visible from all points on campus, the campus itself has few buildings over four stories and has a great deal of greenery. This gives it a distinctly suburban atmosphere quite different from other Atlanta campuses such as that of Georgia State University .

[ 60 ] [ 61 ] The campus is served by two stations on the MARTA rail system, Midtown and North Avenue .

[ 62 ] Georgia Tech's Tech Tower during a miraculous snow day The campus is organized into four main parts: West Campus, East Campus, Central Campus, and Technology Square. West Campus and East Campus are both occupied primarily by student living complexes, while Central Campus is reserved primarily for teaching and research buildings.

[ 60 ] West Campus [ edit ] The front of the Georgia Tech Campus Recreation Center West Campus is occupied primarily by apartments and coed undergraduate dormitories. Apartments include Crecine , Center Street , 6th Street, Maulding, Graduate Living Center (GLC), and Eighth Street Apartments, while dorms include Freeman , Montag , Fitten , Folk , Caldwell , Armstrong, Hefner, Fulmer , and Woodruff Suites.

[ 60 ] The Campus Recreation Center (formerly the Student Athletic Complex); a volleyball court; a large, low natural green area known as the Burger Bowl ; and a flat artificial green area known as the CRC (formerly SAC) Fields are all located on the western side of the campus. In 2017, West Village, a multipurpose facility featuring dining options, meeting space, School of Music classrooms, and offices to West Campus, opened.

[ 63 ] The Robert C. Williams Museum of Papermaking is located on West Campus.

[ 64 ] West Campus was formerly home to Under the Couch , which relocated to the Student Center in the fall of 2010. Also within walking distance of West Campus are several late-night eateries. West Campus was home to a convenience store, West Side Market, which closed following the opening of West Village in the fall of 2017. Due to limited space, all auto travel proceeds via a network of one-way streets which connects West Campus to Ferst Drive, the main road of the campus. Woodruff Dining Hall, or "Woody's", was the West Campus Dining Hall, [ 65 ] before closing after the opening of West Village. It connected the Woodruff North and Woodruff South undergraduate dorms.

[ citation needed ] East Campus [ edit ] Brittain Dining Hall , the main dining hall for East Campus.

East Campus houses all of the fraternities and sororities as well as most of the undergraduate freshman dormitories. East Campus abuts the Downtown Connector , granting residences quick access to Midtown and its businesses (for example, The Varsity ) via a number of bridges over the highway. Georgia Tech football's home, Bobby Dodd Stadium is located on East Campus, as well as Georgia Tech basketball's home, McCamish Pavilion (formerly Alexander Memorial Coliseum).

[ 60 ] Brittain Dining Hall and North Ave Dining Hall are the main dining halls for East Campus. Britain Dining Hall is modeled after a medieval church , complete with carved columns and stained glass windows showing symbolic figures.

[ 65 ] The main road leading from East Campus to Central Campus is a steep ascending incline commonly known as "Freshman Hill" (in reference to the large number of freshman dorms near its foot). On March 8, 2007, the former Georgia State University Village apartments were transferred to Georgia Tech. Renamed North Avenue Apartments by the institute, they began housing students in the fall semester of 2007.

[ 66 ] Central Campus [ edit ] See also: Georgia Institute of Technology Historic District Central Campus is home to the majority of the academic, research, and administrative buildings. The Central Campus includes, among others: the Howey Physics Building; the Boggs Chemistry Building; the College of Computing Building; the Klaus Advanced Computing Building ; the College of Design Building; the Skiles Classroom Building, which houses the School of Mathematics and the School of Literature, Media and Culture; the D. M. Smith Building, which houses the School of Public Policy; the Krone Engineered Biosystems Building , and the Ford Environmental Science & Technology Building.

[ 60 ] In 2005, the School of Modern Languages returned to the Swann Building, a 100-year-old former dormitory that now houses some of the most technology-equipped classrooms on campus.

[ 67 ] [ 68 ] The Carnegie Building, constructed in 1907, is located in the Historic District of Central Campus. It was originally the campus library, and it now houses the President's office.

Tech's administrative buildings, such as Tech Tower, and the Bursar's Office, are also located on the Central Campus, in the recently renovated Georgia Tech Historic District.

[ 69 ] [ 70 ] The campus library , the John Lewis Student Center (formerly the Fred B. Wenn Building), [ 71 ] [ 72 ] and the Student Services Building ("Flag Building") are also located on Central Campus. The Student Center provides a variety of recreational and social functions for students including: a computer lab, a game room ("Tech Rec"), [ 73 ] the Student Post Office, a music venue, a movie theater , the Food Court, plus meeting rooms for various clubs and organizations. Adjacent to the eastern entrance of the Student Center is the Kessler Campanile (which is referred to by students as "The Shaft").

[ 74 ] The former Hightower Textile Engineering building was demolished in 2002 to create Yellow Jacket Park. More greenspace now occupies the area around the Kessler Campanile for a more aesthetically pleasing look, in accordance with the official Campus Master Plan.

[ 75 ] In August 2011, the G. Wayne Clough Undergraduate Learning Commons opened next to the library and occupies part of the Yellow Jacket Park area.

[ 76 ] Technology Square [ edit ] Main article: Technology Square (Atlanta) A view of Technology Square A view of the mixed use Georgia Tech development CODA Technology Square , also known as "Tech Square", is located across the Downtown Connector and embedded in the city east of East Campus.

[ 77 ] Opened in August 2003 at a cost of $179 million, the district was built over run-down neighborhoods and has sparked a revitalization of the entire Midtown area.

[ 78 ] [ 79 ] [ 80 ] Connected by the recently renovated Fifth Street Bridge, it is a pedestrian-friendly area comprising Georgia Tech facilities and retail locations.

[ 78 ] [ 81 ] One complex contains the College of Business Building, holding classrooms and office space for the Scheller College of Business, as well as the Georgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center and the Georgia Tech Global Learning Center.

[ 82 ] Another part of Tech Square, the privately owned Centergy One complex, contains the Technology Square Research Building (TSRB), holding faculty and graduate student offices for the College of Computing and the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering , as well as the GVU Center , a multidisciplinary technology research center.

[ 78 ] The Advanced Technology Development Center (ATDC) is a science and business incubator , run by the Georgia Institute of Technology, and is also headquartered in Technology Square's Centergy One complex.

[ citation needed ] Other Georgia Tech-affiliated buildings in the area host the Center for Quality Growth and Regional Development, the Georgia Tech Enterprise Innovation Institute, the Advanced Technology Development Center, VentureLab, the Georgia Electronics Design Center and the new CODA (mixed-use development) .

[ 83 ] Technology Square also hosts a variety of restaurants and businesses, including the headquarters of notable consulting companies like Accenture and also including the official Institute bookstore, a Barnes & Noble bookstore, and a Georgia Tech-themed Waffle House .

[ 79 ] [ 84 ] Science Square [ edit ] Science Square is a Georgia Tech mixed‐use development dedicated to life sciences and biomedical research. It is located southwest to Georgia Tech’s main campus, serving as a link between the institute and Atlanta’s rapidly evolving Westside community.

[ 85 ] Opened in April 2024, the district spans 18 acres and features over 1.8 million square feet of laboratory and office space, 500 residential units, and 25,000 square feet of retail area.

[ 86 ] Due to eventually be connected to the main campus by a pedestrian bridge, Science Square is the starting point for a multi-phase project designed to lure industry research partners closer to the campus.

[ 87 ] One of its central components is Science Square Labs, a 13-story tower designed to accommodate wet and dry laboratories for academia, industry, and startups.

[ 88 ] Satellite campuses [ edit ] See also: Georgia Tech Savannah ; Georgia Tech Europe ; and Georgia Tech Shenzhen Institute, Tianjin University In 1999, Georgia Tech began offering local degree programs to engineering students in Southeast Georgia, and in 2003 established a physical campus in Savannah, Georgia .

[ 89 ] Until 2013, Georgia Tech Savannah offered undergraduate and graduate programs in engineering in conjunction with Georgia Southern University , South Georgia College , Armstrong Atlantic State University , and Savannah State University .

[ 90 ] The university further collaborated with the National University of Singapore to set up The Logistics Institute–Asia Pacific in Singapore .

[ 90 ] The campus now serves the institute's hub for professional and continuing education and is home to the regional offices of the Georgia Tech Enterprise Innovation Institute, the Savannah Advanced Technology Development Center , and the Georgia Logistics Innovation Center.

[ 91 ] [ 92 ] Georgia Tech Lorraine , Metz , France Georgia Tech also operates a campus in Metz , in northeastern France, known as Georgia Tech Europe (GTE). Opened in October 1990, it offers master's-level courses in Electrical and Computer Engineering , Computer Science and Mechanical Engineering and Ph.D. coursework in Electrical and Computer Engineering and Mechanical Engineering.

[ 93 ] Georgia Tech Europe was the defendant in a lawsuit pertaining to the language used in advertisements, which was a violation of the Toubon Law .

[ 94 ] [ 95 ] Georgia Tech and Tianjin University cooperatively operated a campus in Shenzhen , Guangdong , China — Georgia Tech Shenzhen Institute, Tianjin University .

[ 96 ] Launched in 2014, the institute offered undergraduate and graduate programs in electrical and computer engineering, analytics, computer science, environmental engineering, and industrial design. Admission and degree requirements at the institute are the same as those in Atlanta.

[ 97 ] In September 2024, Georgia Tech announced that it was ending its partnership with Tianjin University following U.S. congressional scrutiny of potential ties to the People's Liberation Army .

[ 98 ] The College of Design (formerly College of Architecture) maintains a small permanent presence in Paris in affiliation with the École d'architecture de Paris-La Villette and the College of Computing has a similar program with the Barcelona School of Informatics at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia in Barcelona, Spain . There are additional programs in Athlone, Ireland , Shanghai, China , and Singapore .

[ 99 ] [ 100 ] Georgia Tech was supposed to have set up two campuses for research and graduate education in the cities of Visakhapatnam and Hyderabad, Telangana , India by 2010, but it appeared the plans had been set on hold as of 2011 [update] .

[ 101 ] [ 102 ] [ 103 ] [ 104 ] [ 105 ] Campus services [ edit ] Georgia Tech Cable Network , or GTCN, is the college's branded cable source. Most non-original programming is obtained from Dish Network . GTCN currently has 100 standard-definition channels and 23 high-definition channels.

[ 106 ] The Office of Information Technology, or OIT, manages most of the institute's computing resources (and some related services such as campus telephones). With the exception of a few computer labs maintained by individual colleges , OIT is responsible for most of the computing facilities on campus. Student, faculty, and staff e-mail accounts are among its services.

[ 107 ] Georgia Tech's ResNet provides free technical support to all students and guests living in Georgia Tech's on-campus housing (excluding fraternities and sororities). ResNet is responsible for network, telephone, and television service, and most support is provided by part-time student employees.

[ 108 ] Organization and administration [ edit ] A pedestrian bridge links the Klaus Advanced Computing Building to the College of Computing Building.

Georgia Tech's undergraduate and graduate programs are divided into seven colleges. Georgia Tech has sought to expand its undergraduate and graduate offerings in less technical fields, primarily those under the Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts , which saw a 20% increase in admissions in 2008.

[ 109 ] Also, even in the Ivan Allen College, the Institute does not offer Bachelor of Arts and Masters of Arts degrees, only Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees. Georgia Tech's honors program is highly selective and designed to cater to the most intellectually curious undergraduates from all six colleges.

[ 110 ] College of Computing College of Design College of Engineering College of Sciences Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts Scheller College of Business College of Lifetime Learning Funding [ edit ] The Georgia Institute of Technology is a public institution that receives funds from the State of Georgia , tuition, fees, research grants, and alumni contributions. In 2014, the institute's revenue amounted to about $1.422 billion. Fifteen percent came from state appropriations and grants while 20% originated from tuition and fees. Grants and contracts accounted for 55% of all revenue. Expenditures were about $1.36 billion. Forty-eight percent went to research and 19% went to instruction.

[ 111 ] The Georgia Tech Foundation runs the university's endowment and was incorporated in 1932. It includes several wholly owned subsidiaries that own land on campus or in Midtown and lease the land back to the Georgia Board of Regents and other companies and organizations. Assets totaled $1.882 billion and liabilities totaled $0.478 billion in 2014.

[ 112 ] As of 2007, Georgia Tech had the most generous alumni donor base, percentage wise, of any public university ranked in the top 50.

[ 113 ] In 2015, the university received a $30 million grant from Atlanta philanthropist Diana Blank [ 114 ] to build the "most environmentally-sound building ever constructed in the Southeast ."

Georgia Tech Housing is subject to a clear geographic division of campus into eastern and western areas that contain the vast majority of housing. East Campus is largely populated by freshmen and is served by Brittain Dining Hall and North Avenue Dining Hall. West Campus houses some freshmen, transfer, and returning students (upperclassmen), and is served by West Village.

[ 65 ] [ 184 ] Graduate students typically live off-campus (for example, in Home Park ) or on-campus in the Graduate Living Center or 10th and Home.

[ 185 ] Just off campus, students can choose from several restaurants, including a half-dozen in Technology Square alone.

[ 186 ] [ 187 ] The institute's administration has implemented programs in an effort to reduce the levels of stress and anxiety felt by Tech students. The Familiarization and Adaptation to the Surroundings and Environs of Tech (FASET) Orientation and Freshman Experience (a freshman-only dorm life program to "encourage friendships and a feeling of social involvement") programs, which seek to help acclimate new students to their surroundings and foster a greater sense of community.

[ 188 ] [ 189 ] As a result, the institute's retention rates improved.

[ 190 ] In the fall of 2007, the North Avenue Apartments were opened to Tech students. Originally built for the 1996 Olympics and belonging to Georgia State University, the buildings were given to Georgia Tech and have been used to accommodate Tech's expanding population. Georgia Tech freshmen students were the first to inhabit the dormitories in the Winter and Spring 1996 quarters, while much of East Campus was under renovation for the Olympics. The North Avenue Apartments (commonly known as "North Ave") are also noted as the first Georgia Tech buildings to rise above the top of Tech Tower. Open to second-year undergraduate students and above, the buildings are located on East Campus, across North Avenue and near Bobby Dodd Stadium, putting more upperclassmen on East Campus.

[ 66 ] In 2008, the North Avenue Apartments East and North buildings underwent extensive renovation to the façade. During their construction, the bricks were not all properly secured and thus were a safety hazard to pedestrians and vehicles on the Downtown Connector below.

[ 191 ] Two programs on campus as well have houses on East Campus: the International House (commonly referred to as the I-House); and Women, Science, and Technology . The I-House is housed in 4th Street East and Hayes. Women, Science, and Technology is housed in Goldin and Stein. The I-House hosts an International Coffee Hour every Monday night that class is in session from 6 to 7 pm, hosting both residents and their guests for discussions.

They compete as a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I level (Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) sub-level for football), as the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets , primarily competing in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) for all sports since the 1979–80 season (a year after they officially joined the conference before beginning conference play), [ 240 ] Coastal Division in any sports split into a divisional format since the 2005–06 season. The Yellow Jackets previously competed as a charter member of the Metro Conference from 1975–76 to 1977–78, [ 240 ] as a charter member of the Southeastern Conference (SEC) from 1932–33 to 1963–64, [ 241 ] as a charter of the Southern Conference (SoCon) from 1921–22 to 1931–32, and as a charter member of the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association (SIAA) from 1895–96 to 1920–21. They also competed as an Independent from 1964–65 to 1974–75 and on the 1978–79 season. Men's sports include baseball, basketball , cross country, football , golf, swimming & diving, cheerleading, tennis and track & field; while women's sports include basketball , cross country, softball, swimming and diving, tennis, track & field, cheerleading, and volleyball. Their cheerleading squad has, in the past, only competed the National Cheerleaders & Dance Association (NCA & NDA) College Nationals along with Buzz and the Goldrush dance team competing here as well. However, in the 2022 season, Goldrush competed at the Universal Cheerleaders & Dance Association (UCA & UDA) College Nationals for the first time and in 2023 the cheer team will compete here for the first time as well.

The Institute mascots are Buzz and the Ramblin' Wreck . The institute's traditional football rival is the University of Georgia ; the rivalry is considered one of the fiercest in college football. The rivalry is commonly referred to as Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate , which is also the title of a book about the subject.

[ 242 ] There is also a long-standing rivalry with Clemson . Tech has eighteen varsity sports: football , women's and men's basketball , baseball , softball, volleyball, golf, men's and women's tennis, men's and women's swimming and diving, men's and women's track and field, men's and women's cross country, and coed cheerleading. Four Georgia Tech football teams were selected as national champions in news polls: 1917, 1928, 1952, and 1990. In May 2007, the women's tennis team won the NCAA National Championship with a 4–2 victory over UCLA, the first ever national title granted by the NCAA to Tech.

[ 243 ] [ 244 ] Fight songs [ edit ] Tech's fight song "I'm a Ramblin' Wreck from Georgia Tech" is known worldwide.

[ 205 ] First published in the 1908 Blue Print , [ 245 ] it was adapted from an old drinking song ("Son of a Gambolier") [ 245 ] and embellished with trumpet flourishes by Frank Roman.

[ 246 ] Then- Vice President Richard Nixon and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev sang the song together when they met in Moscow in 1958 to reduce the tension between them.

[ 245 ] [ 247 ] As the story goes, Nixon did not know any Russian songs, but Khrushchev knew that one American song as it had been sung on The Ed Sullivan Show .

[ 245 ] Georgia Institute of Technology Ramblin' Wreck and Cheerleaders "I'm a Ramblin' Wreck" has had many other notable moments in its history. It is reportedly the first school song to have been played in space .

[ 248 ] Gregory Peck sang the song while strumming a ukulele in the movie The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit .

John Wayne whistled it in The High and the Mighty . Tim Holt's character sings a few bars of it in the movie His Kind of Woman . There are numerous stories of commanding officers in Higgins boats crossing the English Channel on the morning of D-Day leading their men in the song to calm their nerves.

[ 248 ] It is played after every Georgia Tech score in a football game.

[ 245 ] Another popular fight song is " Up With the White and Gold ", which is usually played by the band preceding "Ramblin' Wreck". First published in 1919, "Up with the White and Gold" was also written by Frank Roman. The song's title refers to Georgia Tech's school colors and its lyrics contain the phrase, "Down with the Red and Black", an explicit reference to the school colors of the University of Georgia and the then-budding Georgia Tech–UGA rivalry .

( January 2010 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Main article: Georgia Tech traditions See also: Stealing the T and Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate Tech Tower Georgia Tech has a number of legends and traditions, some of which have persisted for decades. Some are well-known; for example, the most notable of these is the popular but rare tradition of stealing the 'T' from Tech Tower. Tech Tower, Tech's historic primary administrative building, has the letters "TECH" hanging atop it on each of its four sides. There have been several attempts by students to orchestrate complex plans to steal the huge symbolic letter T, and on occasion they have carried this act out successfully.

School colors [ edit ] Georgia Tech students hold a heated, long and ongoing rivalry with the University of Georgia, known as Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate. The first known hostilities between the two institutions trace back to 1891. The University of Georgia's literary magazine proclaimed UGA's colors to be "old gold, black, and crimson". Charles H. Herty, then President of the University of Georgia, felt that old gold was too similar to yellow and that it "symbolized cowardice".

[ 252 ] After the 1893 football game against Tech, Herty removed old gold as an official color.

[ 252 ] Tech would first use old gold for their uniforms, as a proverbial slap in the face to UGA, in their first unofficial football game against Auburn in 1891.

[ 253 ] Georgia Tech's school colors would henceforth be old gold and white.

In April 2018 Georgia Tech went through a comprehensive brand redefinement solidifying the school colors into Tech Gold and White as the primary school colors while Navy Blue serves as the contrasting secondary color. The decision to move forward with gold, white and blue is rooted in history, as the first mention of official Georgia Tech class colors came in the Atlanta Constitution in 1891 (white, blue and gold) and the first GT class ring in 1894 also featured gold, white and blue.

[ 254 ] Mascots [ edit ] Main articles: Buzz (mascot) and Ramblin' Wreck Buzz, the mascot Costumed in plush to look like a yellow jacket , the official mascot of Georgia Tech is Buzz . Buzz enters the football games at the sound of swarming yellow jackets and proceeds to do a flip on the fifty-yard line GT logo. He then bull rushes the goal post and has been known to knock it out of alignment before football games. Buzz is also notorious for crowd surfing and general light-hearted trickery amongst Tech and rival fans.

The Ramblin' Wreck was the first official mascot of Georgia Tech. It is a 1930 Ford Model A Sports Coupe. The Wreck has led the football team onto the field every home game since 1961. The Wreck features a gold and white paint job, two gold flags emblazoned with the words "To Hell With Georgia" and "Give 'Em Hell Tech", and a white soft top. The Wreck is maintained by the Ramblin' Reck Club , a selective student leadership organization on campus.

[ 255 ] Spirit organizations [ edit ] Tech cheerleaders waving flags after a touchdown The Ramblin' Reck Club is charged with upholding all school traditions and creating new traditions such as the SWARM. The SWARM is a 900-member spirit group seated along the north end zone or on the court at basketball games. This is the group that typically features body painting , organized chants , and general fanaticism .

The marching band that performs at halftime and after big plays during the football season is clad in all white and sits next to SWARM at football games providing a dichotomy of white and gold in the North End Zone. The band is also the primary student organization on campus that upholds the tradition of RAT caps, wherein band freshman wear the traditional yellow cap at all band events.

Fight songs and chants [ edit ] The band plays the fight songs Ramblin' Wreck from Georgia Tech and Up With the White and Gold after every football score and between every basketball period. At the end of a rendition of either fight song, there is a series of drum beats followed by the cheer "Go Jackets" three times (each time followed by a second cheer of "bust their ass"), then a different drum beat and the cheer "Fight, Win, Drink, Get Naked!" The official cheer only includes "Fight, Win" but most present other than the band and cheerleaders will yell the extended version.

It is also tradition for the band to play the "When You Say Budweiser" after the third quarter of football and during the second-to-last official timeout of every basketball game. During the "Budweiser Song" , all of the fans in the stadium alternate bending their knees and standing up straight. Other notable band songs are Michael Jackson 's Thriller for half-time at the Thrillerdome , Ludacris ' Move Bitch for large gains in football. Another popular chant is called the Good Word and it begins with asking, "What's the Good Word?" The response from all Tech faithful is, "To Hell With Georgia." The same question is asked three times and then the followup is asked, "How 'bout them dogs?" And everyone yells, "Piss on 'em." Notable people [ edit ] Main articles: List of Georgia Institute of Technology alumni and List of Georgia Institute of Technology athletes See also: Category:Georgia Tech alumni , Category:Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets athletes , Category:Georgia Tech faculty , and Category:Georgia Tech Research Institute people Georgia Tech's first two graduates were H. L. Smith (top row, center) and G. C. Crawford (top row, far right).
