The opposite notion is the excess .

Classically the defect arises in two contexts: in the Euclidean plane, angles about a point add up to 360°, while interior angles in a triangle add up to 180°. However, on a convex polyhedron , the angles of the faces meeting at a vertex add up to less than 360° (a defect), while the angles at some vertices of a nonconvex polyhedron may add up to more than 360° (an excess). Also the angles in a hyperbolic triangle add up to less than 180° (a defect), while those on a spherical triangle add up to more than 180° (an excess).

In modern terms, the defect at a vertex is a discrete version of the curvature of the polyhedral surface concentrated at that point . Negative defect indicates that the vertex resembles a saddle point (negative curvature), whereas positive defect indicates that the vertex resembles a local maximum or minimum (positive curvature). The Gauss–Bonnet theorem gives the total curvature as 2 π π {\displaystyle 2\pi } times the Euler characteristic χ χ = 2 {\displaystyle \chi =2} , so for a convex polyhedron the sum of the defects is 4 π π {\displaystyle 4\pi } , while a toroidal polyhedron has χ χ = 0 {\displaystyle \chi =0} and total defect zero.

Defect of a vertex [ edit ] For a polyhedron , the defect at a vertex equals 2π minus the sum of all the angles at the vertex (all the faces at the vertex are included).  If a polyhedron is convex, then the defect of each vertex is always positive.  If the sum of the angles exceeds a full turn , as occurs in some vertices of many non-convex polyhedra, then the defect is negative.

The concept of defect extends to higher dimensions as the amount by which the sum of the dihedral angles of the cells at a peak falls short of a full circle.

Examples [ edit ] The defect of any of the vertices of a regular dodecahedron (in which three regular pentagons meet at each vertex) is 36°, or π/5 radians, or 1/10 of a circle. Each of the angles measures 108°; three of these meet at each vertex, so the defect is 360° − (108° + 108° + 108°) = 36°.

The same procedure can be followed for the other Platonic solids : Shape Number of vertices Polygons meeting at each vertex Defect at each vertex Total defect tetrahedron 4 Three equilateral triangles π π ( 180 ∘ ∘ ) {\displaystyle \pi \ \ (180^{\circ })} 4 π π ( 720 ∘ ∘ ) {\displaystyle 4\pi \ \ (720^{\circ })} octahedron 6 Four equilateral triangles 2 π π 3 ( 120 ∘ ∘ ) {\displaystyle {2\pi  \over 3}\ (120^{\circ })} 4 π π ( 720 ∘ ∘ ) {\displaystyle 4\pi \ \ (720^{\circ })} cube 8 Three squares π π 2 ( 90 ∘ ∘ ) {\displaystyle {\pi  \over 2}\ \ (90^{\circ })} 4 π π ( 720 ∘ ∘ ) {\displaystyle 4\pi \ \ (720^{\circ })} icosahedron 12 Five equilateral triangles π π 3 ( 60 ∘ ∘ ) {\displaystyle {\pi  \over 3}\ \ (60^{\circ })} 4 π π ( 720 ∘ ∘ ) {\displaystyle 4\pi \ \ (720^{\circ })} dodecahedron 20 Three regular pentagons π π 5 ( 36 ∘ ∘ ) {\displaystyle {\pi  \over 5}\ \ (36^{\circ })} 4 π π ( 720 ∘ ∘ ) {\displaystyle 4\pi \ \ (720^{\circ })} Descartes's theorem [ edit ] Descartes's theorem on the "total defect" of a polyhedron states that if the polyhedron is homeomorphic to a sphere (i.e. topologically equivalent to a sphere, so that it may be deformed into a sphere by stretching without tearing), the "total defect", i.e. the sum of the defects of all of the vertices, is two full circles (or 720° or 4 π radians).  The polyhedron need not be convex.

[ 1 ] A generalization says the number of circles in the total defect equals the Euler characteristic of the polyhedron. This is a special case of the Gauss–Bonnet theorem which relates the integral of the Gaussian curvature to the Euler characteristic. Here the Gaussian curvature is concentrated at the vertices: on the faces and edges the curvature is zero (the surface is locally isometric to a Euclidean plane) and the integral of curvature at a vertex is equal to the defect there (by definition).

This can be used to calculate the number V of vertices of a polyhedron by totaling the angles of all the faces, and adding the total defect (which is 2 π π {\displaystyle 2\pi } times the Euler characteristic). This total will have one complete circle for every vertex in the polyhedron.

A converse to Descartes' theorem is given by Alexandrov's uniqueness theorem , according to which a metric space that is locally Euclidean (hence zero curvature) except for a finite number of points of positive angular defect, adding to 4 π π {\displaystyle 4\pi } , can be realized in a unique way as the surface of a convex polyhedron.

Positive defects on non-convex figures [ edit ] It is tempting to think that every non-convex polyhedron must have some vertices whose defect is negative, but this need not be the case if the Euler characteristic is positive (a topological sphere).

Polyhedra with positive defects A counterexample is provided by a cube where one face is replaced by a square pyramid : this elongated square pyramid is convex and the defects at each vertex are each positive. Now consider the same cube where the square pyramid goes into the cube: this is concave, but the defects remain the same and so are all positive.

Two counterexamples which are self-intersecting polyhedra are the small stellated dodecahedron and the great stellated dodecahedron , with twelve and twenty convex points respectively, all with positive defects.
