For the philologist, essayist, and poet, see Fausto Cercignani .

Carlo Cercignani (17 June 1939 in Teulada – 7 January 2010 in Milan ) was an Italian mathematician known for his work on the kinetic theory of gases. His contributions to the study of Boltzmann's equation include the proof of the H-theorem for polyatomic gases.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] The Cercignani conjecture is named after him.

[ 4 ] Cercignani's conjecture is "sometimes true and always almost true", as proved by the Fields medalist mathematician Cedric Villani .

He is the author of several monographs and more than 300 papers in kinetic theory, as well as of a biography of Boltzmann . Cercignani was member of the French Academy of Sciences [ 5 ] and of the Accademia dei Lincei . He received the Humboldt Prize in 1994.
