This is a list of all crewed spacecraft types that have flown into space, including sub-orbital flights above 80 km, space stations that have been visited by at least one crew member, and spacecraft currently planned to operate with crews in the future.

[ 1 ] It does not contain spacecraft that have only flown uncrewed and have retired from service, even if they were designed for crewed flight, such as Buran , or crewed flights by spacecraft below 80 km. There is some debate concerning the height at which space is reached (the Karman Line ): the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI) recognizes 100 km, while NASA and the USAF recognize this as 50 miles (approx 80 km).

[ 2 ] Since the first crewed spaceflight of Vostok 1 in 1961 there have been 13 types of spacecraft that have made crewed flights into space – nine American, three Russian, and one Chinese.  There are currently five operational crewed spacecraft, which form the first part of the list below; the eight retired spacecraft types are listed in the next section; and crewed spacecraft currently in development are listed last.  Space stations are listed beneath each appropriate section, dates of operation reflect when the first and last crews visited, not when they were launched and deorbited.  There are currently two space stations in orbit around Earth, the International Space Station and the Chinese Tiangong space station .

Manned spacecraft are designed to support human life for the human spaceflight portion of the mission. Spacecraft for human spaceflight must have a human-rating certification as fit for purpose. Manned spacecraft must have a pressurized, breathable atmosphere (usually between 345 mbar and 1 bar (1 atmosphere )) and be temperature-regulated (usually 20 to 24 °C (68 to 75 °F)). Manned spacecraft include space capsules , spaceplanes , and space stations .

Currently operational crewed spacecraft [ edit ] Soyuz (1967) [ edit ] Main article: Soyuz (spacecraft) Soyuz-TMA spacecraft Russian three person Earth orbital spacecraft; [ 3 ] Early versions were operated by the Soviet Union and later versions by Russia after 1991.

Soyuz has completed over 150 crewed spaceflights, including two emergency sub-orbital flights: Soyuz 18a and Soyuz MS-10 . There have been two spacecraft losses resulting in the deaths of four cosmonauts, Soyuz 1 and Soyuz 11 . Soyuz is the only spacecraft to have successfully saved the lives of a crew using the rocket launch escape system , when in 1983 Soyuz T-10-1 exploded on the launchpad. This spacecraft type has flown into space more times than any other spacecraft.

[ 4 ] Shenzhou (2003) [ edit ] Main article: Shenzhou (spacecraft) Chinese three-person Earth orbital spacecraft. Shenzhou is China 's first crewed spacecraft. On 15 October 2003, Yang Liwei was carried into space by Shenzhou 5 becoming China's first Taikonaut .

As of April 2025, Crew Dragon has made 17 crewed spaceflights. The first crewed flight, Crew Dragon Demo-2 , launched on 30 May 2020 and returned to Earth on 2 August 2020. This was the first time an American spacecraft had sent astronauts to orbit since the final Space Shuttle flight in July 2011.

[ 7 ] The first operational flight of the Crew Dragon launched on 15 November 2020 with SpaceX Crew-1 .

New Shepard (2021) [ edit ] Main article: New Shepard New Shepard is a six-person capsule for suborbital space tourism in the United States . It is launched by a reusable booster and can fly with or without crew. Uncrewed flights started in 2015. The first crewed test flight flew on 20 July 2021.

[ 8 ] As of December 2023 there have been 24 flights, including six crewed flights carrying a total of 32 passengers into space.

Starliner (2024) [ edit ] Main article: Boeing Starliner Starliner performing a pad abort test in 2019 The Boeing CST-100 Starliner is a United States five-person (initially seven) Earth orbital spacecraft designed to transport astronauts to the International Space Station under the NASA Commercial Crew Program . Following several technical problems 1  on the first uncrewed test flight in December 2019, a second uncrewed test flight launched in May 2022. The following crewed flight test (CFT) launched in June 2024, carrying astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore to the International Space Station. After experiencing thruster issues during its approach and docking, the astronauts successfully completed their mission at the ISS and departed the station. Due to ongoing assessments and mission adjustments, the Starliner landed uncrewed. The Crew-9 mission, carrying astronauts Nick Hague, Suni Williams, Butch Wilmore, and cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov, splashed down in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Florida on March 18, 2025. This landing marked the end of a long space saga for Williams and Wilmore, who arrived at the ISS aboard the Starliner.

Consisting of two components – a Crew Module (CM) manufactured by Lockheed Martin , and a European Service Module (ESM) manufactured by Airbus Defence and Space – the spacecraft are designed to support crewed exploration beyond low Earth orbit . Orion is equipped with solar power , an automated docking system , and glass cockpit interfaces modeled after those used in the Boeing 787 Dreamliner , and can support a crew of six in low Earth orbit and a crew of four in lunar orbit, up to 21 days undocked and up to six months docked. A single AJ10 engine provides the spacecraft's primary propulsion, while eight R-4D-11 engines and six pods of custom reaction control system (RCS) engines developed by Airbus provide the spacecraft's secondary propulsion. Although compatible with other launch vehicles , Orion is primarily designed to launch atop the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket. The first mission on that flew a fully configured Orion spacecraft and service module was Artemis I . This flight, however, was not a crewed mission and served the purpose of testing the systems of the spacecraft in the environment it was designed for.
