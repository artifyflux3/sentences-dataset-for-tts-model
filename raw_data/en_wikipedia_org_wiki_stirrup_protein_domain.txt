It obtains its name due to its resemblance to an old fashioned Japanese stirrup . Stirrip has a molecular mass of 9 kDa and is folded into an alpha/beta structure . It allows for binding of the reductase to DNA via electrostatic interactions, since it has a predominance of positive charges distributed on its surface.

[ 1 ] Function [ edit ] This protein domain provides the precursors necessary for DNA synthesis. It catalyses the biosynthesis of DNA from RNA .

[ 2 ] Structure [ edit ] This structure contains a three-stranded beta-sheet to the solvent, which lies against alpha-helices .
