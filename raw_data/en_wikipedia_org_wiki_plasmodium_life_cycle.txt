Plasmodiocarp of the slime mold Hemitrichia serpula : the living structure contains many nuclei, not separated from each other by cell membranes or cell walls.

A plasmodium is a living structure of cytoplasm that contains many nuclei , rather than being divided into individual cells each with a single nucleus.

Plasmodia are best known from slime molds , but are also found in parasitic Myxosporea , and some algae such as the Chlorarachniophyta .

Structure [ edit ] A plasmodium is an amoeboid , multinucleate , and naked mass of cytoplasm that contains many diploid nuclei . The resulting structure, a coenocyte , is created by many nuclear divisions without the process of cytokinesis , which in other organisms pulls newly-divided cells apart.

[ 1 ] In some cases, the resulting structure is a syncytium , created by the fusion of cells after division. Under suitable conditions, a plasmodium may differentiate and form fruiting bodies bearing spores at their tips.

Taxonomic distribution [ edit ] The term plasmodium, introduced by Leon Cienkowski , [ 2 ] usually refers to the feeding stage of slime molds ; these are macroscopic mycetozoans .

[ 3 ] The multinucleate developmental stages of some intracellular parasites , namely Microsporidia (now in Fungi ) and Myxosporidia (now in Cnidaria ), former cnidosporans , are also sometimes called plasmodia.

[ 4 ] Similarly, in Rhizaria , the amoeboid, multinucleate protoplasts of some Cercozoan algae, e.g.

Chlorarachniophyta , are called plasmodia. These lack cell walls; the syncytia are created by cell fusion. Some plasmodiophorids and haplosporidians are other multinucleated rhizarians.
