EMEA: Europe , the Middle East , and Africa , marked on a world map.

Europe, the Middle East and Africa , commonly known by its acronym EMEA among the North American business spheres, is a geographical region used by institutions, governments and global spheres of marketing, media and business when referring to this region. The acronym EMEA is a shorthand way of referencing the two continents ( Africa and Europe ) and the Middle Eastern sub-continent all at once.

As the name suggests, the region includes all of the countries found on the continents of Africa and Europe, as well as the countries that make up the Middle East. The region is generally accepted to include all European nations and all African nations, and extends east to Iran , including part of Russia . Typically, the acronym does not include overseas territories of mainland countries in the region, such as French Guiana . However, the term is not completely clear, and while it usually refers to Europe, the Middle East and Africa, it is not uncommon for businesses and other institutions to slightly tweak the countries they include under this umbrella term.

One of the reasons why the term is commonly used is because it is useful for business purposes, as most of the region falls within four time zones , which facilitates communication and travel.

[ 1 ] Historical influence [ edit ] The historical influence and interdependence of Europe on the Middle East and Africa in relation to trade routes contributed to the development of the term EMEA.

[ 2 ] The establishment of the Suez Canal in 1869 impacted international commerce.

[ 3 ] It directly linked Europe to the Indian Ocean and East Asian trade routes.

[ 3 ] The direct channel between Britain and India enabled Britain to gradually gain authority over Egypt .

[ 2 ] This authority was reinforced via the development and maintenance of the Pax Britannica which gave Britain naval power and control over the world's maritime trade routes during the late nineteenth century period of peace.

Some companies separate their Eastern European business from the rest of Europe, and refer to the EEMEA region separately from the Western / Central European ( EU / EFTA ) region Southern Europe , Middle East and Africa (SEMEA) Southeastern Europe , Middle East and Africa (SEEMEA) Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) Central Europe, Middle East and Africa (CEMEA) [ 5 ] The Middle East and Africa (MEA) The Middle East and North Africa ( MENA ) The Middle East, Turkey and Africa (META) The Middle East, North Africa, Afghanistan and Pakistan (MENAP) Europe and the Middle East (EME) Europe, the Middle East and North Africa (EUMENA or EMENA) Europe, the Middle East, India and Africa (EMEIA or EMIA) Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Russia (EMEAR) Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Commonwealth of Independent States (EMEACIS) Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Caribbean (EMEAC) The Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), around the Black Sea and Caspian Sea North Atlantic and Central Europe (NACE) Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa (CEMA) [ 6 ] Europe, Latin America, Africa, Arab world Component areas [ edit ] The EMEA region generally includes: Europe [ edit ] Central and Eastern Europe , Southern Caucasus and Central Asia [ edit ] Armenia Azerbaijan Belarus Bulgaria Czech Republic Georgia Hungary Moldova Poland Romania Russia Slovakia Ukraine Kazakhstan Kyrgyzstan Tajikistan Turkmenistan Uzbekistan Northern Europe [ edit ] Denmark Estonia Finland Iceland Latvia Lithuania Norway Sweden Southern Europe [ edit ] Albania Bosnia and Herzegovina Croatia Cyprus Greece Italy Kosovo Malta Montenegro North Macedonia Portugal Serbia Slovenia Spain Turkey Western Europe [ edit ] Austria Belgium France Germany Ireland Luxembourg Netherlands Switzerland United Kingdom Middle East, North Africa ( MENA ) [ edit ] Algeria Bahrain Egypt Iran Iraq Israel Jordan Kuwait Lebanon Libya Morocco Oman Palestine Qatar Saudi Arabia Syria Tunisia United Arab Emirates Yemen Sub-Saharan Africa [ edit ] Eastern Africa [ edit ] Burundi Djibouti Eritrea Ethiopia Kenya Rwanda Somalia South Sudan Sudan Tanzania Uganda Central Africa [ edit ] Cameroon Central African Republic Chad Democratic Republic of the Congo Republic of the Congo Equatorial Guinea Gabon São Tomé and Príncipe Southern Africa [ edit ] Angola Botswana Comoros Eswatini Lesotho Madagascar Malawi Mauritius Mozambique Namibia Seychelles South Africa Zambia Zimbabwe Western Africa [ edit ] Benin Burkina Faso Cape Verde Gambia Ghana Guinea Guinea-Bissau Ivory Coast Liberia Mali Mauritania Niger Nigeria Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha Senegal Sierra Leone Togo Economic overview [ edit ] The World Bank's April 2024 update indicates that the growth rate for the Europe, Middle-East and African region, is expected to slightly increase to 4.6% in 2024, up from 4.4% in 2023. This underscores a diverse economic resilience against global pressures. Meanwhile, global trade growth, which was minimal at 0.2% in 2023, is projected to improve to 2.3% in 2024, crucial for the region's export-oriented economies. However, private investment remains below pre-pandemic levels due to higher debt levels and rising interest rates, signaling a cautious investment climate. The region faces significant challenges from both external factors, such as high core inflation and modest global trade recovery, and domestic issues like increased debt and political uncertainties, potentially hindering economic growth. Additionally, a hypothetical 1% decline in GDP growth in the US or China could reduce GDP growth in other developing Europe, Middle-East and African economies by approximately 0.5% and 0.3%, respectively. The increase in trade-distorting measures, which have tripled since 2019 among G-20 countries, reflects a trend towards protective industrial policies, although other European, Middle-Eastern, and African countries, except for the Big Four , South Africa , Russia , Turkey and Saudi Arabia , have been less involved in these measures.
