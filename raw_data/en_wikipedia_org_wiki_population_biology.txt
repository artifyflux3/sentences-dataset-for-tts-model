In 1971, Edward O. Wilson et al . used the term in the sense of applying mathematical models to population genetics , community ecology , and population dynamics .

[ 1 ] Alan Hastings used the term in 1997 as the title of his book on the mathematics used in population dynamics.

[ 2 ] The name was also used for a course given at UC Davis in the late 2010s, which describes it as an interdisciplinary field combining the areas of ecology and evolutionary biology . The course includes mathematics , statistics , ecology, genetics , and systematics . Numerous types of organisms are studied.

[ 3 ] The journal Theoretical Population Biology is published.
