It is one example of a Kaniadakis distribution . The κ-Logistic probability distribution describes the population kinetics behavior of bosonic ( 0 < λ λ < 1 {\displaystyle 0<\lambda <1} ) or fermionic ( λ λ > 1 {\displaystyle \lambda >1} ) character.

[ 1 ] Definitions [ edit ] Probability density function [ edit ] The Kaniadakis κ -Logistic distribution is a four-parameter family of continuous statistical distributions , which is part of a class of statistical distributions emerging from the Kaniadakis κ-statistics . This distribution has the following probability density function : [ 1 ] f κ κ ( x ) = λ λ α α β β x α α − − 1 1 + κ κ 2 β β 2 x 2 α α exp κ κ ⁡ ⁡ ( − − β β x α α ) [ 1 + ( λ λ − − 1 ) exp κ κ ⁡ ⁡ ( − − β β x α α ) ] 2 {\displaystyle f_{_{\kappa }}(x)={\frac {\lambda \alpha \beta x^{\alpha -1}}{\sqrt {1+\kappa ^{2}\beta ^{2}x^{2\alpha }}}}{\frac {\exp _{\kappa }(-\beta x^{\alpha })}{[1+(\lambda -1)\exp _{\kappa }(-\beta x^{\alpha })]^{2}}}} valid for x ≥ ≥ 0 {\displaystyle x\geq 0} ,  where 0 ≤ ≤ | κ κ | < 1 {\displaystyle 0\leq |\kappa |<1} is the entropic index associated with the Kaniadakis entropy , β β > 0 {\displaystyle \beta >0} is the rate parameter , λ λ > 0 {\displaystyle \lambda >0} , and α α > 0 {\displaystyle \alpha >0} is the shape parameter.

The Logistic distribution is recovered as κ κ → → 0.

{\displaystyle \kappa \rightarrow 0.} Cumulative distribution function [ edit ] The cumulative distribution function of κ -Logistic is given by F κ κ ( x ) = 1 − − exp κ κ ⁡ ⁡ ( − − β β x α α ) 1 + ( λ λ − − 1 ) exp κ κ ⁡ ⁡ ( − − β β x α α ) {\displaystyle F_{\kappa }(x)={\frac {1-\exp _{\kappa }(-\beta x^{\alpha })}{1+(\lambda -1)\exp _{\kappa }(-\beta x^{\alpha })}}} valid for x ≥ ≥ 0 {\displaystyle x\geq 0} . The cumulative Logistic distribution is recovered in the classical limit κ κ → → 0 {\displaystyle \kappa \rightarrow 0} .

Survival and hazard functions [ edit ] The survival distribution function of κ -Logistic distribution is given by S κ κ ( x ) = λ λ exp κ κ ⁡ ⁡ ( β β x α α ) + λ λ − − 1 {\displaystyle S_{\kappa }(x)={\frac {\lambda }{\exp _{\kappa }(\beta x^{\alpha })+\lambda -1}}} valid for x ≥ ≥ 0 {\displaystyle x\geq 0} . The survival Logistic distribution is recovered in the classical limit κ κ → → 0 {\displaystyle \kappa \rightarrow 0} .

The hazard function associated with the κ -Logistic distribution is obtained by the solution of the following evolution equation: S κ κ ( x ) d x = − − h κ κ S κ κ ( x ) ( 1 − − λ λ − − 1 λ λ S κ κ ( x ) ) {\displaystyle {\frac {S_{\kappa }(x)}{dx}}=-h_{\kappa }S_{\kappa }(x)\left(1-{\frac {\lambda -1}{\lambda }}S_{\kappa }(x)\right)} with S κ κ ( 0 ) = 1 {\displaystyle S_{\kappa }(0)=1} , where h κ κ {\displaystyle h_{\kappa }} is the hazard function: h κ κ = α α β β x α α − − 1 1 + κ κ 2 β β 2 x 2 α α {\displaystyle h_{\kappa }={\frac {\alpha \beta x^{\alpha -1}}{\sqrt {1+\kappa ^{2}\beta ^{2}x^{2\alpha }}}}} The cumulative Kaniadakis κ -Logistic distribution is related to the hazard function by the following expression: S κ κ = e − − H κ κ ( x ) {\displaystyle S_{\kappa }=e^{-H_{\kappa }(x)}} where H κ κ ( x ) = ∫ ∫ 0 x h κ κ ( z ) d z {\displaystyle H_{\kappa }(x)=\int _{0}^{x}h_{\kappa }(z)dz} is the cumulative hazard function. The cumulative hazard function of the Logistic distribution is recovered in the classical limit κ κ → → 0 {\displaystyle \kappa \rightarrow 0} .

Related distributions [ edit ] The survival function of the κ -Logistic distribution represents the κ -deformation of the Fermi-Dirac function, and becomes a Fermi-Dirac distribution in the classical limit κ κ → → 0 {\displaystyle \kappa \rightarrow 0} .

[ 1 ] The κ -Logistic distribution is a generalization of the κ -Weibull distribution when λ λ = 1 {\displaystyle \lambda =1} .

A κ -Logistic distribution corresponds to a Half-Logistic distribution when λ λ = 2 {\displaystyle \lambda =2} , α α = 1 {\displaystyle \alpha =1} and κ κ = 0 {\displaystyle \kappa =0} .

The ordinary Logistic distribution is a particular case of a κ -Logistic distribution, when κ κ = 0 {\displaystyle \kappa =0} .

Applications [ edit ] The κ -Logistic distribution has been applied in several areas, such as: In quantum statistics , the survival function of the κ -Logistic distribution represents the most general expression of the Fermi-Dirac function, reducing to the Fermi-Dirac distribution in the limit κ κ → → 0 {\displaystyle \kappa \rightarrow 0} .
