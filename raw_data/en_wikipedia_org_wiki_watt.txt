The **watt** (symbol: **W**) is the unit of [power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(physics) "Power (physics)") or [radiant flux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiant_flux "Radiant flux") in the [International System of Units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units "International System of Units") (SI), equal to 1 [joule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joule "Joule") per [second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second "Second") or 1 kg⋅m 2⋅s−3.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt#cite_note-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt#cite_note-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt#cite_note-3) It is used to [quantify](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantification_(science) "Quantification (science)") the rate of [energy transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(physics) "Work (physics)"). The watt is named in honor of [James Watt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Watt "James Watt") (1736–1819), an 18th-century [Scottish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_people "Scottish people")[inventor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inventor "Inventor"), [mechanical engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_engineer "Mechanical engineer"), and [chemist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemist "Chemist") who improved the [Newcomen engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcomen_engine "Newcomen engine") with his own [steam engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt_steam_engine "Watt steam engine") in 1776, which became fundamental for the [Industrial Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution "Industrial Revolution").

When an object's [velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity "Velocity") is held constant at one [meter per second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meter_per_second "Meter per second") against a constant opposing force of one [newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_(unit) "Newton (unit)"), the rate at which [work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(physics) "Work (physics)") is done is one watt. ![Image 3: {\displaystyle \mathrm {1~W=1~J{/}s=1~N{\cdot }m{/}s=1~kg{\cdot }m^{2}{\cdot }s^{-3}} .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/943e860ffad439da286c693ec86ab976be2ae3e9)

In terms of [electromagnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetism "Electromagnetism"), one watt is the rate at which [electrical work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_work "Electrical work") is performed when a current of one [ampere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampere "Ampere") (A) flows across an electrical [potential difference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_difference "Potential difference") of one [volt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt "Volt") (V), meaning the watt is equivalent to the [volt-ampere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt-ampere "Volt-ampere") (the latter unit, however, is used for a different quantity from the [real power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_power "Real power") of an electrical circuit). ![Image 4: {\displaystyle \mathrm {1~W=1~V{\cdot }A} .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/658572a9f9306003ffc571fc5ee578c9132266e8)

Two additional [unit conversions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_conversion "Unit conversion") for watt can be found using the above equation and [Ohm's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm%27s_law "Ohm's law"). ![Image 5: {\displaystyle \mathrm {1~W=1~V^{2}/\Omega =1~A^{2}{\cdot }\Omega } ,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/63a5bfb9d0f526a2efbe697bcce655e1915c27fd) where [ohm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm "Ohm") (![Image 6: {\displaystyle \Omega }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/24b0d5ca6f381068d756f6337c08e0af9d1eeb6f)) is the [SI derived unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI_derived_unit "SI derived unit") of [electrical resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance "Electrical resistance").

*   A person having a mass of 100 kg who climbs a 3-meter-high ladder in 5 seconds is doing work at a rate of about 600 watts. Mass times acceleration due to [gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity "Gravity") times height divided by the time it takes to lift the object to the given height gives the _rate of doing work_ or _power_.[[i]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt#cite_note-4)
*   A laborer over the course of an eight-hour day can sustain an average output of about 75 watts; higher power levels can be achieved for short intervals and by athletes.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt#cite_note-5)

The watt is named after the Scottish inventor [James Watt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Watt "James Watt").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt#cite_note-Klein-6) The unit name was proposed by [C. William Siemens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Wilhelm_Siemens "Carl Wilhelm Siemens") in August 1882 in his President's Address to the Fifty-Second Congress of the [British Association for the Advancement of Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Science "British Association for the Advancement of Science").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt#cite_note-Siemens-7) Noting that units in the [practical system of units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CGS#Practical_CGS_units "CGS") were named after leading physicists, Siemens proposed that _watt_ might be an appropriate name for a unit of power.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt#cite_note-8) Siemens defined the unit within the existing system of practical units as "the power conveyed by a current of an [Ampère](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampere "Ampere") through the difference of potential of a Volt".[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt#cite_note-9)

In October 1908, at the International Conference on Electric Units and Standards in London,[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt#cite_note-10) so-called _international_ definitions were established for practical electrical units.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt#cite_note-EB11-742-11) Siemens' definition was adopted as the _international_ watt. (Also used: 1 A 2 × 1 Ω.)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt#cite_note-Klein-6) The watt was defined as equal to 10 7 units of power in the _practical system_ of units.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt#cite_note-EB11-742-11) The ["international units"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Electrical_and_Magnetic_Units#Overdefinition_and_the_1908_modification "International System of Electrical and Magnetic Units") were dominant from 1909 until 1948. After the 9th [General Conference on Weights and Measures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Conference_on_Weights_and_Measures "General Conference on Weights and Measures") in 1948, the _international_ watt was redefined from practical units to absolute units (i.e., using only length, mass, and time). Concretely, this meant that 1 watt was defined as the quantity of energy transferred in a unit of time, namely 1 J/s. In this new definition, 1 _absolute_ watt= 1.00019 _international_ watts. Texts written before 1948 are likely to be using the _international_ watt, which implies caution when comparing numerical values from this period with the post-1948 watt.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt#cite_note-Klein-6) In 1960, the 11th General Conference on Weights and Measures adopted the _absolute_ watt into the [International System of Units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units "International System of Units") (SI) as the unit of power.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt#cite_note-12)

Attowatt The sound intensity in water corresponding to the international standard reference [sound pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_pressure "Sound pressure") of 1[μPa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micropascal "Micropascal") is approximately 0.65 aW/m 2.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt#cite_note-13)Femtowatt Powers measured in femtowatts are typically found in references to [radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio "Radio") and [radar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar "Radar") receivers. For example, meaningful [FM tuner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FM_tuner "FM tuner") performance figures for sensitivity, quieting and [signal-to-noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal-to-noise "Signal-to-noise") require that the [RF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RF "RF") energy applied to the antenna input be specified. These input levels are often stated in dBf ([decibels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decibel "Decibel") referenced to 1 femtowatt). This is 0.2739 microvolts across a 75-ohm load or 0.5477 microvolt across a 300-ohm load; the specification takes into account the RF [input impedance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_impedance "Input impedance") of the tuner.Picowatt Powers measured in picowatts are typically used in reference to radio and radar receivers, [acoustics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustics "Acoustics") and in the science of [radio astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_astronomy "Radio astronomy"). One picowatt is the international standard reference value of [sound power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_power "Sound power") when this quantity is expressed in decibels.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt#cite_note-14)Nanowatt Powers measured in nanowatts are also typically used in reference to radio and radar receivers.Microwatt Powers measured in microwatts are typically stated in [medical instrumentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_instrument "Medical instrument") systems such as the [electroencephalograph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalograph "Electroencephalograph") (EEG) and the [electrocardiograph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiograph "Electrocardiograph") (ECG), in a wide variety of scientific and engineering instruments, and in reference to radio and radar receivers. Compact [solar cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_cells "Solar cells") for devices such as [calculators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar-powered_calculator "Solar-powered calculator") and [watches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar-powered_watch "Solar-powered watch") are typically measured in microwatts.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt#cite_note-15)Milliwatt A typical [laser pointer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_pointer "Laser pointer") outputs about five milliwatts of light power, whereas a typical [hearing aid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_aid "Hearing aid") uses less than one milliwatt.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt#cite_note-16)[Audio signals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_signal "Audio signal") and other electronic signal levels are often measured in [dBm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBm "DBm"), referenced to one milliwatt.Kilowatt
"Kilowatt" and "Kilowatts" redirect here. For the musician James Watts, see [KiloWatts (musician)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KiloWatts_(musician) "KiloWatts (musician)").

The kilowatt is typically used to express the output power of [engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engine "Engine") and the power of [electric motors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_motor "Electric motor"), tools, machines, and heaters. It is also a common unit used to express the [electromagnetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation "Electromagnetic radiation") power output of broadcast radio and television [transmitters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmitter "Transmitter"). One kilowatt is approximately equal to 1.34 [horsepower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsepower "Horsepower"). A small electric heater with one [heating element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heating_element "Heating element") can use 1 kilowatt. The average [electric power consumption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_consumption "Electric power consumption") of a household in the United States is about 1 kilowatt.[[ii]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt#cite_note-18) A surface area of 1 square meter on Earth receives typically about one kilowatt of sunlight from the Sun (the [solar irradiance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_irradiance "Solar irradiance")) (on a clear day at midday, close to the equator).[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt#cite_note-19)Megawatt Many events or machines produce or sustain the conversion of energy on this scale, including large electric motors; large warships such as aircraft carriers, cruisers, and submarines; large [server farms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_farm "Server farm") or [data centers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center#Energy_use "Data center"); and some scientific research equipment, such as [supercolliders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercollider "Supercollider"), and the output pulses of very large lasers. A large residential or commercial building may use several megawatts in electric power and heat. On railways, modern high-powered [electric locomotives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_locomotive "Electric locomotive") typically have a peak power output of 5 or 6 MW, while some produce much more. The [Eurostar e300](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurostar_e300 "Eurostar e300"), for example, uses more than 12 MW, while heavy [diesel-electric locomotives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diesel_electric_locomotive "Diesel electric locomotive") typically produce and use 3 and 5 MW. U.S. [nuclear power plants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_plant "Nuclear power plant") have net summer capacities between about 500 and 1300 MW.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt#cite_note-20): 84–101  The earliest citing of the megawatt in the _[Oxford English Dictionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford\_English\_Dictionary "Oxford English Dictionary")_ (_OED_) is a reference in the 1900 [_Webster's International Dictionary of the English Language_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webster%27s_Dictionary "Webster's Dictionary"). The _OED_ also states that _megawatt_ appeared in a November 28, 1947, article in the journal _[Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science\_(journal) "Science (journal)")_ (506:2).

A [United States Department of Energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Energy "United States Department of Energy") video explaining gigawatts

Gigawatt A gigawatt is typical average power for an industrial city of one million habitants, and is the output of a large power station. The GW unit is thus used for large power plants and [power grids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_grid "Power grid"). For example, by the end of 2010, power shortages in China's Shanxi province were expected to increase to 5–6 GW[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt#cite_note-21) and the installation capacity of wind power in Germany was 25.8 GW.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt#cite_note-22) The largest unit (out of four) of the Belgian [Doel Nuclear Power Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doel_Nuclear_Power_Station "Doel Nuclear Power Station") has a peak output of 1.04 GW.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt#cite_note-23)[HVDC converters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HVDC_converter "HVDC converter") have been built with power ratings of up to 2 GW.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt#cite_note-24)Terawatt The [primary energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_energy "Primary energy") used by humans worldwide was about 160,000 terawatt-hours in 2019, corresponding to an average continuous power consumption of 18 TW that year.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt#cite_note-25)[Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_internal_heat_budget "Earth's internal heat budget") itself emits 47±2 TW,[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt#cite_note-26) far less than the energy received from solar radiation. The most powerful lasers from the mid-1960s to the mid-1990s produced power in terawatts, but only for [nanosecond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanosecond "Nanosecond") intervals. The average lightning strike peaks at 1 TW, but these strikes only last for 30 [microseconds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsecond "Microsecond").Petawatt A petawatt can be produced by the current generation of lasers for time scales on the order of picoseconds. One such laser is [Lawrence Livermore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Livermore_National_Laboratory "Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory")'s [Nova laser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova_laser "Nova laser"), which achieved a power output of 1.25 PW by a process called [chirped pulse amplification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chirped_pulse_amplification "Chirped pulse amplification"). The duration of the pulse was roughly 0.5[ps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picosecond "Picosecond"), giving a total energy of 600 J.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt#cite_note-27) Another example is the Laser for Fast Ignition Experiments (LFEX) at the Institute of Laser Engineering (ILE), [Osaka University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osaka_University "Osaka University"), which achieved a power output of 2 PW for a duration of approximately 1[ps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picosecond "Picosecond").[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt#cite_note-28)[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt#cite_note-29) Based on the average total solar irradiance of 1.361 kW/m 2,[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt#cite_note-TSI-30) the total power of sunlight striking Earth's atmosphere is estimated at 174 PW. The planet's average rate of global warming, measured as [Earth's energy imbalance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_energy_budget#Earth's_energy_imbalance_(EEI) "Earth's energy budget"), reached about 0.5 PW (0.3% of incident solar power) by 2019.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt#cite_note-31)Yottawatt The power output of the Sun is 382.8 YW, about 2 billion times the power estimated to reach Earth's atmosphere.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt#cite_note-Sun_Fact_Sheet-32)

Conventions in the electric power industry
------------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Watt&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Conventions in the electric power industry")]

In the [electric power industry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_industry "Electric power industry"), _megawatt electrical_ (_MWe_[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt#cite_note-33) or MW e)[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt#cite_note-34) refers by convention to the [electric power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power "Electric power") produced by a generator, while _megawatt thermal_ or _thermal megawatt_[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt#cite_note-35) (MWt, MW t, or MWth, MW th) refers to [thermal power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_power "Thermal power") produced by the plant. For example, the [Embalse nuclear power plant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embalse_nuclear_power_plant "Embalse nuclear power plant") in Argentina uses a [fission reactor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fission_reactor "Fission reactor") to generate 2,109 MW t (i.e. heat), which creates steam to drive a turbine, which generates 648 MW e (i.e. electricity). Other [SI prefixes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI_prefix "SI prefix") are sometimes used, for example _gigawatt electrical_ (GW e). The [International Bureau of Weights and Measures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Bureau_of_Weights_and_Measures "International Bureau of Weights and Measures"), which maintains the SI-standard, states that further information about a quantity should not be attached to the unit symbol but instead to the quantity symbol (e.g., _P_ th = 270 W rather than _P_ = 270 W th) and so these unit symbols are non-SI.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt#cite_note-36) In compliance with SI, the energy company [Ørsted A/S](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%98rsted_(company) "Ørsted (company)") uses the unit megawatt for produced electrical power and the equivalent unit [megajoule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megajoule "Megajoule") per second for delivered heating power in a [combined heat and power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combined_heat_and_power "Combined heat and power") station such as [Avedøre Power Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aved%C3%B8re_Power_Station "Avedøre Power Station").[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt#cite_note-37)

When describing [alternating current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternating_current "Alternating current") (AC) electricity, another distinction is made between the watt and the [volt-ampere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt-ampere "Volt-ampere"). While these units are equivalent for simple [resistive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistor "Resistor")[circuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_network "Electrical network"), they differ when loads exhibit [electrical reactance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_reactance "Electrical reactance").

[Radio stations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_stations "Radio stations") usually report the power of their [transmitters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmitter "Transmitter") in units of watts, referring to the [effective radiated power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_radiated_power "Effective radiated power"). This refers to the power that a [half-wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-wave_antenna "Half-wave antenna")[dipole antenna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipole_antenna "Dipole antenna") would need to radiate to match the intensity of the transmitter's [main lobe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_lobe "Main lobe").

Distinction between watts and watt-hours
----------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Watt&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Distinction between watts and watt-hours")]

The terms [power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(physics) "Power (physics)") and [energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy "Energy") are closely related but distinct physical quantities. Power is the rate at which energy is generated or consumed and hence is measured in units (e.g. watts) that represent energy _per unit time_.

For example, when a [light bulb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_bulb "Light bulb") with a [power rating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_rating "Power rating") of 100 W is turned on for one hour, the energy used is 100 [watt hours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt_hour "Watt hour") (W·h), 0.1 kilowatt hour, or 360[kJ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joule#Kilojoule "Joule"). This same amount of energy would light a 40-watt bulb for 2.5 hours, or a 50-watt bulb for 2 hours.

[Power stations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_station "Power station") are rated using units of power, typically megawatts or gigawatts (for example, the [Three Gorges Dam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Gorges_Dam "Three Gorges Dam") in China is rated at approximately 22 gigawatts). This reflects the maximum power output it can achieve at any point in time. A power station's annual energy output, however, would be recorded using units of energy (not power), typically gigawatt hours. Major energy production or consumption is often expressed as [terawatt hours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terawatt_hour "Terawatt hour") for a given period; often a calendar year or financial year. One terawatt hour of energy is equal to a sustained power delivery of one terawatt for one hour, or approximately 114 megawatts for a period of one year:

Power output = energy / time 1 terawatt hour per year = 1×10 12 W·h / (365 days × 24 hours per day) ≈ 114 million watts,
equivalent to approximately 114 megawatts of constant power output.

The [watt-second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt-second "Watt-second") is a unit of energy, equal to the [joule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joule "Joule"). One kilowatt hour is 3,600,000 watt seconds.

While a watt per hour is a unit of rate of change of power with time,[[iii]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt#cite_note-38) it is not correct to refer to a watt (or watt-hour) as a watt per hour.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt#cite_note-39)

1.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt#cite_ref-4)**The energy in climbing the stairs is given by mgh. Setting _m_ = 100 kg, _g_ = 9.8 m/s 2 and _h_ = 3 m gives 2940 J. Dividing this by the time taken (5 s) gives a power of 588 W.
2.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt#cite_ref-18)**Average household electric power consumption is 1.19 kW in the US, 0.53 kW in the UK. In India it is 0.13 kW (urban) and 0.03 kW (rural) – computed from GJ figures quoted by Nakagami, Murakoshi and Iwafune.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt#cite_note-17)
3.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt#cite_ref-38)**Watts per hour refers to the _rate of change_ of power being used (or generated). For example, a power plant that changes its power output from 100 MW to 200 MW in 15 minutes would have a ramp-up rate of 400 MW/h. Gigawatts per hour are used to characterize the ramp-up required of the [power plants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_plant "Power plant") on an electric grid to compensate for loss of output from other sources, such as when [solar power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_power "Solar power") generation drops to zero as the sun sets. See [duck curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_curve "Duck curve").
