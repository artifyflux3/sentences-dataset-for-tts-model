He is best known for his collaboration with David Hilbert on the 1932 book Anschauliche Geometrie , translated into English as Geometry and the Imagination .

[ 1 ] Both Cohn-Vossen's inequality and the Cohn-Vossen transformation are named after him.

[ 2 ] He also proved the first version of the splitting theorem .

Biography [ edit ] Stefan Cohn-Vossen was born 28 May, 1902 to Emanuel Cohn, a lawyer, and Hedwig (née Vossen) in Breslau (then a city in the Kingdom of Prussia ; now Wrocław in Poland ). He attended Göttingen in 1920; his notes from Hilbert's lectures on geometry at that time would form the basis for Anschauliche Geometrie .
He wrote a 1924 doctoral dissertation at the University of Breslau (now the University of Wrocław ) under the supervision of Adolf Kneser .

[ 3 ] In 1929 he completed his habilitation at Göttingen with his thesis Non-rigid closed surfaces [ 4 ] under Richard Courant .

[ 5 ] Cohn-Vossen became a professor at the University of Cologne in 1930.

[ 6 ] In 1931, Cohn-Vossen married Dr. Margot Maria Elfriede Ranft.

Anschauliche Geometrie was published in 1932; the book was well reviewed [ 7 ] [ 8 ] and by association with Hilbert, Cohn-Vossen became well known.

[ 9 ] He was barred from lecturing in 1933 under Nazi racial legislation , because he was Jewish .

[ 10 ] Unable to work in Germany, Cohn-Vossen moved to Switzerland in 1934, first to Locarno and then to Zurich , where he taught gymnasium . His son, Richard Cohn-Vossen [ de ] , was born in Zurich in September 1934. Both Courant and Karl Löwner recommended Cohn-Vossen for positions abroad, at Istanbul and Dartmouth respectively; ultimately he emigrated to the USSR , with support from Herman Müntz , Fritz Houtermans , Pavel Alexandrov , and Heinz Hopf , [ 11 ] where he was appointed to the Academy of Sciences and worked at Leningrad State University and the Steklov Institute .

[ 12 ] [ 13 ] Cohn-Vossen died in Moscow from pneumonia in 1936.

[ 14 ] Despite his short time in the USSR, Cohn-Vossen had a significant impact on the development of differential geometry "in the large" [ 15 ] in Soviet mathematics.

[ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] Following Cohn-Vossen's death, his widow, Dr. Elfriede Cohn-Vossen, remarried Alfred Kurella , returned to Germany in 1954, and died in 1957. His son, Richard, became a filmmaker. In 1946, unaware of his death, the University of Cologne offered Cohn-Vossen his professorship back.
