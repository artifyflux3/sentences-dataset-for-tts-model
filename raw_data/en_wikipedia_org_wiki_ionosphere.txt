Relationship of the atmosphere and ionosphere

The **ionosphere** ()[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere#cite_note-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere#cite_note-2) is the [ionized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionization "Ionization") part of the [upper atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_atmosphere "Upper atmosphere") of Earth, from about 48 km (30 mi) to 965 km (600 mi) [above sea level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Height_above_sea_level "Height above sea level"),[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere#cite_note-3) a region that includes the [thermosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermosphere "Thermosphere") and parts of the [mesosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesosphere "Mesosphere") and [exosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exosphere "Exosphere"). The ionosphere is ionized by [solar radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_irradiance "Solar irradiance"). It plays an important role in [atmospheric electricity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_electricity "Atmospheric electricity") and forms the inner edge of the [magnetosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetosphere "Magnetosphere").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere#cite_note-plasmasphere-4) It has practical importance because, among other functions, it influences [radio propagation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_propagation "Radio propagation") to distant places on [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere#cite_note-rawer-5) Travel through this layer also impacts [GPS signals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_signals "GPS signals"), resulting in effects such as deflection in their path and delay in the arrival of the signal.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere#cite_note-6)

History of discovery
--------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ionosphere&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: History of discovery")]

As early as 1839, the German mathematician and physicist [Carl Friedrich Gauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss "Carl Friedrich Gauss") postulated that an electrically conducting region of the atmosphere could account for observed variations of Earth's magnetic field.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere#cite_note-7) Sixty years later, [Guglielmo Marconi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guglielmo_Marconi "Guglielmo Marconi") received the first trans-Atlantic radio signal on December 12, 1901, in [St. John's, Newfoundland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._John%27s,_Newfoundland "St. John's, Newfoundland") (now in [Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada "Canada")) using a 152.4 m (500 ft) kite-supported antenna for reception.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere#cite_note-8) The transmitting station in [Poldhu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poldhu "Poldhu"), Cornwall, used a [spark-gap transmitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spark-gap_transmitter "Spark-gap transmitter") to produce a signal with a [frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency "Frequency") of approximately 500[kHz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilohertz "Kilohertz") and a power of 100 times more than any radio signal previously produced. The message received was three dits, the [Morse code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code "Morse code") for the letter **S**. To reach Newfoundland the signal would have to bounce off the ionosphere twice. Dr. [Jack Belrose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Belrose "Jack Belrose") has contested this, however, based on theoretical and experimental work.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere#cite_note-9) However, Marconi did achieve transatlantic wireless communications in [Glace Bay, Nova Scotia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glace_Bay,_Nova_Scotia "Glace Bay, Nova Scotia"), one year later.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere#cite_note-10)

In 1902, [Oliver Heaviside](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Heaviside "Oliver Heaviside") proposed the existence of the [Kennelly–Heaviside layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennelly%E2%80%93Heaviside_layer "Kennelly–Heaviside layer") of the ionosphere which bears his name.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere#cite_note-11) Heaviside's proposal included means by which radio signals are transmitted around the Earth's curvature. Also in 1902, [Arthur Edwin Kennelly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Edwin_Kennelly "Arthur Edwin Kennelly") discovered some of the ionosphere's radio-electrical properties.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere#cite_note-12)

In 1912, the [U.S. Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Congress "U.S. Congress") imposed the [Radio Act of 1912](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Act_of_1912 "Radio Act of 1912") on [amateur radio operators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_radio_operators "Amateur radio operators"), limiting their operations to frequencies above 1.5 MHz (wavelength 200 meters or smaller). The government thought those frequencies were useless. This led to the discovery of HF radio propagation via the ionosphere in 1923.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere#cite_note-13)

In 1925, observations during [a solar eclipse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse_of_January_24,_1925 "Solar eclipse of January 24, 1925") in New York by [Dr. Alfred N. Goldsmith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Norton_Goldsmith "Alfred Norton Goldsmith") and his team demonstrated the influence of sunlight on radio wave propagation, revealing that short waves became weak or inaudible while long waves steadied during the eclipse, thus contributing to the understanding of the ionosphere's role in radio transmission.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere#cite_note-14)

In 1926, Scottish physicist [Robert Watson-Watt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Watson-Watt "Robert Watson-Watt") introduced the term _ionosphere_ in a letter published only in 1969 in _[Nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature\_(journal) "Nature (journal)")_:[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere#cite_note-15)

> We have in quite recent years seen the universal adoption of the term 'stratosphere'..and..the companion term 'troposphere'...The term 'ionosphere', for the region in which the main characteristic is large scale ionisation with considerable mean free paths, appears appropriate as an addition to this series.

In the early 1930s, test transmissions of [Radio Luxembourg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Luxembourg "Radio Luxembourg") inadvertently provided evidence of the first radio modification of the ionosphere; [HAARP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAARP "HAARP") ran a series of experiments in 2017 using the eponymous [Luxembourg Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxemburg%E2%80%93Gorky_effect "Luxemburg–Gorky effect").[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere#cite_note-Gakona_HAARPoon_2017-16)

[Edward V. Appleton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_V._Appleton "Edward V. Appleton") was awarded a [Nobel Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize "Nobel Prize") in 1947 for his confirmation in 1927 of the existence of the ionosphere. [Lloyd Berkner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloyd_Berkner "Lloyd Berkner") first measured the height and density of the ionosphere. This permitted the first complete theory of short-wave radio propagation. [Maurice V. Wilkes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_V._Wilkes "Maurice V. Wilkes") and [J. A. Ratcliffe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._A._Ratcliffe "J. A. Ratcliffe") researched the topic of radio propagation of very long radio waves in the ionosphere. [Vitaly Ginzburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitaly_Ginzburg "Vitaly Ginzburg") has developed a theory of electromagnetic wave propagation in plasmas such as the ionosphere.

In 1962, the [Canadian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada "Canada") satellite [Alouette 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alouette_1 "Alouette 1") was launched to study the ionosphere. Following its success were [Alouette 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alouette_2 "Alouette 2") in 1965 and the two [ISIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISIS_(satellite) "ISIS (satellite)") satellites in 1969 and 1971, further AEROS-A and -B in 1972 and 1975, all for measuring the ionosphere.

On July 26, 1963, the first operational geosynchronous satellite Syncom 2 was launched.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere#cite_note-17) On board radio beacons on this satellite (and its successors) enabled – for the first time – the measurement of [total electron content](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_electron_content "Total electron content") (TEC) variation along a radio beam from geostationary orbit to an earth receiver. (The rotation of the plane of polarization directly measures TEC along the path.) Australian geophysicist [Elizabeth Essex-Cohen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Essex-Cohen "Elizabeth Essex-Cohen") from 1969 onwards was using this technique to monitor the atmosphere above Australia and Antarctica.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere#cite_note-18)

The ionosphere is a shell of [electrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron "Electron") and electrically charged [atoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom "Atom") and [molecules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule "Molecule") that surrounds the Earth,[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere#cite_note-19) stretching from a height of about 50 km (30 mi) to more than 1,000 km (600 mi). It exists primarily due to [ultraviolet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet "Ultraviolet") radiation from the [Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun "Sun").

The lowest part of the [Earth's atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_atmosphere "Earth's atmosphere"), the [troposphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troposphere "Troposphere"), extends from the surface to about 10 km (6 mi). Above that is the [stratosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratosphere "Stratosphere"), followed by the mesosphere. In the stratosphere incoming solar radiation creates the [ozone layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone_layer "Ozone layer"). At heights of above 80 km (50 mi), in the [thermosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermosphere "Thermosphere"), the atmosphere is so thin that free electrons can exist for short periods of time before they are captured by a nearby positive [ion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion "Ion"). The number of these free electrons is sufficient to affect [radio propagation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_propagation "Radio propagation"). This portion of the atmosphere is partially _ionized_ and contains a [plasma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_physics "Plasma physics") which is referred to as the ionosphere.

[Ultraviolet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet "Ultraviolet") (UV), [X-ray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray "X-ray") and shorter [wavelengths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelength "Wavelength") of [solar radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_radiation "Solar radiation") are _ionizing,_ since [photons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon "Photon") at these frequencies contain sufficient energy to dislodge an electron from a neutral gas atom or molecule upon absorption. In this process the light electron obtains a high velocity so that the [temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature "Temperature") of the created electronic gas is much higher (of the order of thousand K) than the one of ions and neutrals. The reverse process to [ionization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionization "Ionization") is [recombination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombination_(chemistry) "Recombination (chemistry)"), in which a free electron is "captured" by a positive ion. Recombination occurs spontaneously, and causes the emission of a photon carrying away the energy produced upon recombination. As gas density increases at lower altitudes, the recombination process prevails, since the gas molecules and ions are closer together. The balance between these two processes determines the quantity of ionization present.

Ionization depends primarily on the Sun and its Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) and X-ray irradiance which varies strongly with [solar activity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_variation "Solar variation"). The more magnetically active the Sun is, the more [sunspot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunspot "Sunspot") active regions there are on the Sun at any one time. Sunspot active regions are the source of increased [coronal heating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronal_heating "Coronal heating") and accompanying increases in EUV and X-ray irradiance, particularly during episodic magnetic eruptions that include [solar flares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_flares "Solar flares") that increase ionization on the sunlit side of the Earth and [solar energetic particle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_energetic_particle "Solar energetic particle") events that can increase ionization in the polar regions. Thus the degree of ionization in the ionosphere follows both a [diurnal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day "Day") (time of day) cycle and the 11-year [solar cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_cycle "Solar cycle"). There is also a seasonal dependence in ionization degree since the local winter [hemisphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth") is tipped away from the Sun, thus there is less received solar radiation. Radiation received also varies with geographical location (polar, [auroral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auroral "Auroral") zones, [mid-latitudes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-latitudes "Mid-latitudes"), and equatorial regions). There are also mechanisms that disturb the ionosphere and decrease the ionization.

[Sydney Chapman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Chapman_(mathematician) "Sydney Chapman (mathematician)") proposed that the region below the ionosphere be called _**neutrosphere**_[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere#cite_note-Chapman1950-20) (the _**neutral atmosphere**_).[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere#cite_note-21)[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere#cite_note-22)

Layers of ionization
--------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ionosphere&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Layers of ionization")]

[![Image 2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/Ionosphere_Layers_en.svg/350px-Ionosphere_Layers_en.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ionosphere_Layers_en.svg)

Ionospheric layers.

At night the F layer is the only layer of significant ionization present, while the ionization in the E and D layers is extremely low. During the day, the D and E layers become much more heavily ionized, as does the F layer, which develops an additional, weaker region of ionization known as the F 1 layer. The F 2 layer persists by day and night and is the main region responsible for the refraction and reflection of radio waves.

[![Image 3](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Ionospheric_layers_from_night_to_day.png/250px-Ionospheric_layers_from_night_to_day.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ionospheric_layers_from_night_to_day.png)

[Lightning sprites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprite_(lightning) "Sprite (lightning)").

The D layer is the innermost layer, 48 to 90 km (30 to 56 mi) above the surface of the Earth. Ionization here is due to [Lyman series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyman_series "Lyman series")-alpha hydrogen radiation at a [wavelength](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelength "Wavelength") of 121.6 [nanometre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanometre "Nanometre") (nm) ionizing [nitric oxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide "Nitric oxide") (NO). In addition, [solar flares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_flares "Solar flares") can generate hard X-rays (wavelength < 1 nm) that ionize N 2 and O 2. Recombination rates are high in the D layer, so there are many more neutral air molecules than ions.

Medium frequency (MF) and lower high frequency (HF) [radio waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_wave "Radio wave") are significantly attenuated within the D layer, as the passing radio waves cause electrons to move, which then collide with the neutral molecules, giving up their energy. Lower frequencies experience greater absorption because they move the electrons farther, leading to greater chance of collisions. This is the main reason for [absorption of HF radio waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionospheric_absorption "Ionospheric absorption"), particularly at 10 MHz and below, with progressively less absorption at higher frequencies. This effect peaks around noon and is reduced at night due to a decrease in the D layer's thickness; only a small part remains due to [cosmic rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_rays "Cosmic rays"). A common example of the D layer in action is the disappearance of distant AM [broadcast band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_band "Broadcast band") stations in the daytime.

During [solar proton events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_proton_event "Solar proton event"), ionization can reach unusually high levels in the D-region over high and polar latitudes. Such very rare events are known as Polar Cap Absorption (PCA) events, because the increased ionization significantly enhances the absorption of radio signals passing through the region.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere#cite_note-Rose1962-23) In fact, absorption levels can increase by many tens of dB during intense events, which is enough to absorb most (if not all) transpolar HF radio signal transmissions. Such events typically last less than 24 to 48 hours.

The [E layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennelly%E2%80%93Heaviside_layer "Kennelly–Heaviside layer") is the middle layer, 90 to 150 km (56 to 93 mi) above the surface of the Earth. Ionization is due to soft X-ray (1–10 nm) and far ultraviolet (UV) solar radiation ionization of molecular [oxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen "Oxygen") (O 2). Normally, at oblique incidence, this layer can only reflect radio waves having frequencies lower than about 10 MHz and may contribute a bit to absorption on frequencies above. However, during intense [sporadic E](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporadic_E "Sporadic E") events, the E s layer can reflect frequencies up to 50 MHz and higher. The vertical structure of the E layer is primarily determined by the competing effects of ionization and recombination. At night the E layer weakens because the primary source of ionization is no longer present. After sunset an increase in the height of the E layer maximum increases the range to which radio waves can travel by reflection from the layer.

This region is also known as the [Kennelly–Heaviside layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennelly%E2%80%93Heaviside_layer "Kennelly–Heaviside layer") or simply the Heaviside layer. Its existence was predicted in 1902 independently and almost simultaneously by the American electrical engineer [Arthur Edwin Kennelly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Edwin_Kennelly "Arthur Edwin Kennelly") (1861–1939) and the British physicist [Oliver Heaviside](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Heaviside "Oliver Heaviside") (1850–1925). In 1924 its existence was detected by [Edward V. Appleton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_V._Appleton "Edward V. Appleton") and [Miles Barnett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Aylmer_Fulton_Barnett "Miles Aylmer Fulton Barnett").

The E s layer ([sporadic](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sporadic#Adjective "wikt:sporadic") E-layer) is characterized by small, thin clouds of intense ionization, which can support reflection of radio waves, frequently up to 50 MHz and rarely up to 450 MHz. Sporadic-E events may last for just a few minutes to many hours. [Sporadic E propagation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporadic_E_propagation "Sporadic E propagation") makes VHF-operating by [radio amateurs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_radio_high_bands "Amateur radio high bands") very exciting when long-distance propagation paths that are generally unreachable "open up" to two-way communication. There are multiple causes of sporadic-E that are still being pursued by researchers. This propagation occurs every day during June and July in northern hemisphere mid-latitudes when high signal levels are often reached. The skip distances are generally around 1,640 km (1,020 mi). Distances for one hop propagation can be anywhere from 900 to 2,500 km (560 to 1,550 mi). Multi-hop propagation over 3,500 km (2,200 mi) is also common, sometimes to distances of 15,000 km (9,300 mi) or more.

[![Image 5](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/Msis_atmospheric_composition_by_height.svg/500px-Msis_atmospheric_composition_by_height.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Msis_atmospheric_composition_by_height.svg)

Main gases of the ionosphere (about 50 km; 31 miand above on this chart) vary considerably by altitude

The [F layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F_region "F region") or region, also known as the Appleton–Barnett layer, extends from about 150 km (93 mi) to more than 500 km (310 mi) above the surface of Earth. It is the layer with the highest electron density, which implies signals penetrating this layer will escape into space. Electron production is dominated by [extreme ultraviolet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_ultraviolet "Extreme ultraviolet") (UV, 10–100 nm) radiation ionizing atomic oxygen. The F layer consists of one layer (F 2) at night, but during the day, a secondary peak (labelled F 1) often forms in the electron density profile. Because the F 2 layer remains by day and night, it is responsible for most [skywave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skywave "Skywave") propagation of [radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio "Radio") waves and long distance [high frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_frequency "High frequency") (HF, or [shortwave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortwave "Shortwave")) radio communications.

Above the F layer, the number of [oxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen "Oxygen") ions decreases and lighter ions such as hydrogen and helium become dominant. This region above the F layer peak and below the [plasmasphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmasphere "Plasmasphere") is called the topside ionosphere.

From 1972 to 1975 [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA "NASA") launched the [AEROS and AEROS B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AEROS_(satellite) "AEROS (satellite)") satellites to study the F region.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere#cite_note-Yenne-24)

An **ionospheric model** is a mathematical description of the ionosphere as a function of location, altitude, day of year, phase of the sunspot cycle and geomagnetic activity. Geophysically, the state of the ionospheric [plasma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics) "Plasma (physics)") may be described by four parameters: _electron density, electron and ion [temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature "Temperature")_ and, since several species of ions are present, _ionic composition_. [Radio propagation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_propagation "Radio propagation") depends uniquely on electron density.

Models are usually expressed as computer programs. The model may be based on basic physics of the interactions of the ions and electrons with the neutral atmosphere and sunlight, or it may be a statistical description based on a large number of observations or a combination of physics and observations. One of the most widely used models is the [International Reference Ionosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Reference_Ionosphere "International Reference Ionosphere") (IRI),[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere#cite_note-25) which is based on data and specifies the four parameters just mentioned. The IRI is an international project sponsored by the [Committee on Space Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_on_Space_Research "Committee on Space Research") (COSPAR) and the [International Union of Radio Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Union_of_Radio_Science "International Union of Radio Science") (URSI).[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere#cite_note-26) The major data sources are the worldwide network of [ionosondes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosonde "Ionosonde"), the powerful [incoherent scatter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incoherent_scatter "Incoherent scatter") radars (Jicamarca, [Arecibo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arecibo_Telescope "Arecibo Telescope"), Millstone Hill, Malvern, St Santin), the ISIS and Alouette topside [sounders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_infrared_sounder "Atmospheric infrared sounder"), and in situ instruments on several satellites and rockets. IRI is updated yearly. IRI is more accurate in describing the variation of the electron density from bottom of the ionosphere to the altitude of maximum density than in describing the [total electron content](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_electron_content "Total electron content") (TEC). Since 1999 this model is "International Standard" for the terrestrial ionosphere (standard TS16457).

Persistent anomalies to the idealized model
-------------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ionosphere&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Persistent anomalies to the idealized model")]

[![Image 6](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Ionosphere-Thermosphere_Processes.jpg/250px-Ionosphere-Thermosphere_Processes.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ionosphere-Thermosphere_Processes.jpg)

Overview of ionosphere phenomena

[Ionograms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionogram "Ionogram") allow deducing, via computation, the true shape of the different layers. Nonhomogeneous structure of the [electron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron "Electron")/[ion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion "Ion")-[plasma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics) "Plasma (physics)") produces rough echo traces, seen predominantly at night and at higher latitudes, and during disturbed conditions.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere#cite_note-27)

During summer, the Sun illuminates the Earth at a steeper angle, leading to an increase in daytime ion production in the F2 layer, particularly in electron density. Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) radiation plays a key role in the formation of ions in this region of the ionosphere.

In summer, the composition of the neutral atmosphere—mainly N₂, O₂, and atomic oxygen (O)—changes. In particular, the reduction in atomic oxygen and the enhanced transport processes of neutral nitrogen accelerate ion loss mechanisms. These seasonal variations lead to increased recombination, diffusion, and loss of ions during summer. As a result, despite the higher ion production in summer, the greater losses cause the total F2 ionization to decrease; this explains why daytime maximum electron densities are higher in winter (the local winter season) than in summer.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere#cite_note-28)

The “winter anomaly” or winter effect is observed almost continuously at mid-latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere. That is, during the local winter months, the critical frequencies of the F2 layer (and consequently the maximum electron density) are higher than in summer. This behavior persists in the Northern Hemisphere regardless of solar activity; however, it is rarely observed or appears weak in the Southern Hemisphere during periods of low solar energy.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere#cite_note-:2-29)

During periods of low solar activity in the Southern Hemisphere, this anomaly is generally absent. The behavior of the F2 layer differs significantly between the two hemispheres; in particular, in the south, the correlation between the winter anomaly and variations in F2 electron density with solar activity is quite weak. Regional geomagnetic features, such as the South Atlantic Magnetic Anomaly, along with atmospheric circulation, contribute to the inconsistency of the winter anomaly in the Southern Hemisphere.

Many statistical and observational studies have shown that both variations in atmospheric components (such as the O/N₂ ratio) and solar and magnetic activity contribute to triggering this anomaly. Scientists such as Torr & Torr, Rishbeth, and Roble have demonstrated that the composition of neutral gases plays a key role in the ion loss mechanisms of the F2 layer.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere#cite_note-:2-29)

Within approximately ± 20 degrees of the _magnetic equator_, is the _[equatorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equator "Equator") anomaly._[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere#cite_note-:0-30)[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere#cite_note-31) It is the occurrence of a trough in the ionization in the F 2 layer at the equator and crests at about 17 degrees in magnetic latitude.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere#cite_note-:0-30) The [Earth's magnetic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_magnetic_field "Earth's magnetic field") lines are horizontal at the magnetic equator. Solar heating and [tidal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tide "Tide") oscillations in the lower ionosphere move plasma up and across the magnetic field lines. This sets up a sheet of electric current in the E region which, with the [horizontal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_plane "Horizontal plane") magnetic field, forces ionization up into the F layer, concentrating at ± 20 degrees from the magnetic equator. This phenomenon is known as the _equatorial fountain_.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere#cite_note-:1-32)

### Equatorial electrojet

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ionosphere&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Equatorial electrojet")]

The worldwide solar-driven wind results in the so-called Sq (solar quiet) current system in the E region of the Earth's ionosphere ([ionospheric dynamo region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionospheric_dynamo_region "Ionospheric dynamo region")) (100–130 km (60–80 mi) altitude).[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] Resulting from this current is an electrostatic field directed west–east (dawn–dusk) in the equatorial day side of the ionosphere. At the magnetic dip equator, where the geomagnetic field is horizontal, this electric field results in an enhanced eastward current flow within ± 3 degrees of the magnetic equator, known as the [equatorial electrojet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equatorial_electrojet "Equatorial electrojet").[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere#cite_note-:1-32)

Ephemeral ionospheric perturbations
-----------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ionosphere&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Ephemeral ionospheric perturbations")]

### X-rays: sudden ionospheric disturbances (SID)

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ionosphere&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: X-rays: sudden ionospheric disturbances (SID)")]

X-rays and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) radiation emitted during [solar flares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_flare "Solar flare") rapidly increase electron density in the ionosphere, particularly in the D region, thereby enhancing the absorption of high-frequency (HF) radio waves. This phenomenon leads to a sudden ionospheric disturbance (SID) and can cause radio blackouts lasting for hours. Analyses using GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) data and TEC (Total Electron Content) measurements clearly demonstrate the fluctuations in electron density and the increased absorption caused by solar flares. Furthermore, electrons in the D region quickly recombine after the flare, allowing transmission conditions to return to normal.

During solar flares, high-energy X-rays and ultraviolet radiation reach the upper layers of the Earth's atmosphere, causing molecular ionization. As a result, short-term decreases in ozone concentration and temporary increases in ionospheric density have been observed. During a strong proton event in 1982, ozone concentration was temporarily observed to decrease by as much as 70%.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere#cite_note-33)

X-ray and UV radiation emitted during solar activity rapidly alter the temperature and electrical conductivity of the ionosphere, leading to disruptions in shortwave and high-frequency (HF) radio communications. The thickness and altitude of the ionosphere can increase or decrease, directly affecting HF radio propagation, and signal transmission may take hours to return to normal, particularly following solar flares.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere#cite_note-34)

### Protons: polar cap absorption (PCA)

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ionosphere&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Protons: polar cap absorption (PCA)")]

Associated with solar flares is a release of high-energy protons. These particles can hit the Earth within 15 minutes to 2 hours of the solar flare. The protons spiral around and down the magnetic field lines of the Earth and penetrate into the atmosphere near the magnetic poles increasing the ionization of the D and E layers. PCA's typically last anywhere from about an hour to several days, with an average of around 24 to 36 hours. [Coronal mass ejections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronal_mass_ejection "Coronal mass ejection") can also release energetic protons that enhance D-region absorption in the polar regions.

Geomagnetic storms and ionospheric storms are temporary and intense disturbances of the Earth's [magnetosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetosphere "Magnetosphere") and ionosphere.

During a geomagnetic storm the F₂ layer will become unstable, fragment, and may even disappear completely. In the Northern and Southern polar regions of the Earth [aurorae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_aurora "Polar aurora") will be observable in the night sky.

Lightning can cause ionospheric perturbations in the D-region in one of two ways. The first is through VLF (very low frequency) radio waves launched into the [magnetosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetosphere "Magnetosphere"). These so-called "whistler" mode waves can interact with radiation belt particles and cause them to precipitate onto the ionosphere, adding ionization to the D-region. These disturbances are called "lightning-induced [electron precipitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_precipitation "Electron precipitation")" (LEP) events.

Additional ionization can also occur from direct heating/ionization as a result of huge motions of charge in lightning strikes. These events are called early/fast.

In 1925, C. T. R. Wilson proposed a mechanism by which electrical discharge from lightning storms could propagate upwards from clouds to the ionosphere. Around the same time, Robert Watson-Watt, working at the Radio Research Station in Slough, UK, suggested that the ionospheric sporadic E layer (E s) appeared to be enhanced as a result of lightning but that more work was needed. In 2005, C. Davis and C. Johnson, working at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in Oxfordshire, UK, demonstrated that the E s layer was indeed enhanced as a result of lightning activity. Their subsequent research has focused on the mechanism by which this process can occur.

### Radio communication

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ionosphere&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: Radio communication")]

Due to the ability of ionized atmospheric gases to [refract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refract "Refract") high frequency (HF, or [shortwave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortwave "Shortwave")) radio waves, the ionosphere can reflect radio waves directed into the sky back toward the Earth. Radio waves directed at an angle into the sky can return to Earth beyond the horizon. This technique, called "skip" or "[skywave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skywave "Skywave")" propagation, has been used since the 1920s to communicate at international or intercontinental distances. The returning radio waves can reflect off the Earth's surface into the sky again, allowing greater ranges to be achieved with multiple [hops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hop_(telecommunications) "Hop (telecommunications)"). This communication method is variable and unreliable, with reception over a given path depending on time of day or night, the seasons, weather, and the 11-year [sunspot cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunspot_cycle "Sunspot cycle"). During the first half of the 20th century it was widely used for transoceanic telephone and telegraph service, and business and diplomatic communication. Due to its relative unreliability, shortwave radio communication has been mostly abandoned by the telecommunications industry, though it remains important for high-latitude communication where the availability of satellite-based radio communication may be insufficient. Shortwave broadcasting is useful in crossing international boundaries and covering large areas at low cost. Automated services still use [shortwave radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortwave_radio "Shortwave radio") frequencies, as do [radio amateur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_amateur "Radio amateur") hobbyists for private recreational contacts and to assist with emergency communications during natural disasters. Armed forces use shortwave so as to be independent of vulnerable infrastructure, including satellites, and the low latency of shortwave communications make it attractive to stock traders, where milliseconds count.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere#cite_note-35)

#### Mechanism of refraction

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ionosphere&action=edit&section=20 "Edit section: Mechanism of refraction")]

When a radio wave reaches the ionosphere, the [electric field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_field "Electric field") in the wave forces the electrons in the ionosphere into [oscillation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscillation "Oscillation") at the same frequency as the radio wave. Some of the radio-frequency energy is given up to this resonant oscillation. The oscillating electrons will then either be lost to recombination or will re-radiate the original wave energy. Total refraction can occur when the collision frequency of the ionosphere is less than the radio frequency, and if the electron density in the ionosphere is great enough.

A qualitative understanding of how an electromagnetic wave propagates through the ionosphere can be obtained by recalling [geometric optics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_optics "Geometric optics"). Since the ionosphere is a plasma, it can be shown that the [refractive index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractive_index "Refractive index") is less than unity. Hence, the electromagnetic "ray" is bent away from the normal rather than toward the normal as would be indicated when the refractive index is greater than unity. It can also be shown that the refractive index of a plasma, and hence the ionosphere, is frequency-dependent, see [Dispersion (optics)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispersion_(optics) "Dispersion (optics)").[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere#cite_note-36)

The [critical frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_frequency "Critical frequency") is the limiting frequency at or below which a radio wave is reflected by an ionospheric layer at vertical [incidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle_of_incidence_(optics) "Angle of incidence (optics)"). If the transmitted frequency is higher than the [plasma frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_frequency "Plasma frequency") of the ionosphere, then the electrons cannot respond fast enough, and they are not able to re-radiate the signal. It is calculated as shown below:

![Image 8: {\displaystyle f_{\text{critical}}=9\times {\sqrt {N}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1411dd2d565fc6a2583fb92806b7283183c51428)
where N = electron density per m 3 and f critical is in Hz.

The Maximum Usable Frequency (MUF) is defined as the upper frequency limit that can be used for transmission between two points at a specified time.

![Image 9: {\displaystyle f_{\text{muf}}={\frac {f_{\text{critical}}}{\sin \alpha }}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/262b3d3c414180d0dd21e6637ed5811b361aed99)
where ![Image 10: {\displaystyle \alpha }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b79333175c8b3f0840bfb4ec41b8072c83ea88d3) = [angle of arrival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle_of_arrival "Angle of arrival"), the angle of the wave relative to the [horizon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon "Horizon"), and sin is the [sine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine "Sine") function.

The [cutoff frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutoff_frequency "Cutoff frequency") is the frequency below which a radio wave fails to penetrate a layer of the ionosphere at the incidence angle required for transmission between two specified points by refraction from the layer.

### GPS/GNSS ionospheric correction

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ionosphere&action=edit&section=21 "Edit section: GPS/GNSS ionospheric correction")]

[![Image 11: [icon]](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg)This section **needs expansion**. You can help by [adding to it](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ionosphere&action=edit&section=). _(October 2013)_

There are a number of models used to understand the effects of the ionosphere on global navigation satellite systems. The **Klobuchar model** is currently used to compensate for ionospheric effects in [GPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS "GPS"). This model was developed at the **US Air Force Geophysical Research Laboratory** circa 1974 by **John (Jack) Klobuchar**.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere#cite_note-37) The [Galileo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_(satellite_navigation) "Galileo (satellite navigation)") navigation system uses the **NeQuick model**.[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere#cite_note-Galileo2016-38)**GALILEO** broadcasts 3 coefficients to compute the effective ionization level, which is then used by the **NeQuick** model to compute a range delay along the line-of-sight.[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere#cite_note-39)

The Klobuchar model is a widely used empirical model designed to mitigate ionospheric delays in GPS satellites. It was developed around 1974 by John A. Klobuchar at the U.S. Air Force Geophysics Laboratory. The model represents the ionosphere as a single-layer, two-dimensional structure and calculates ionospheric delay using eight parameters (the Ion α and Ion β coefficients). These parameters are updated seasonally and at different times of the day by GPS master control stations. In particular, at mid-latitudes, the model can reduce the impact of the ionosphere by approximately 50%. It is used to compute vertical Total Electron Content (TEC) values at the height of the ionosphere (around 350–450 km) and to derive slant TEC values based on the angle at which the signal passes through the ionosphere.

The NeQuick model is a more sophisticated and higher-accuracy model used in the Galileo navigation system. It calculates ionospheric electron density numerically based on geographic coordinates, time (UT), and ionospheric height parameters. The Galileo system broadcasts three coefficients to account for ionospheric delay, which are then used with the NeQuick model to compute the ionospheric range delay along the signal path. Compared to the Klobuchar model for GPS, the NeQuick model provides approximately 20% better horizontal positioning accuracy and 11% better vertical accuracy for single-frequency receivers.

Both models are primarily designed to improve positioning accuracy, especially for single-frequency GNSS receivers. Due to the high cost of multi-frequency receivers, the Klobuchar and NeQuick models provide real-time and cost-effective solutions. Today, the Klobuchar model is used as the standard for GPS, mitigating approximately 50% of ionospheric error, while the NeQuick model, with its more detailed structure, can compensate for up to 70% of ionospheric effects. Corrections made using these models reduce the impact of variations in the signal’s travel time through the ionosphere, thereby enhancing the accuracy of GNSS-based navigation and positioning.

The [open system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_system_(systems_theory) "Open system (systems theory)")[electrodynamic tether](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrodynamic_tether "Electrodynamic tether"), which uses the ionosphere, is being researched. The [space tether](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tether "Space tether") uses plasma contactors and the ionosphere as parts of a circuit to extract energy from the Earth's magnetic field by [electromagnetic induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_induction "Electromagnetic induction").

Properties of Earth's Upper Atmosphere

Scientists explore the structure of the ionosphere by a wide variety of methods. They include:

*   passive observations of optical and radio emissions generated in the ionosphere
*   bouncing radio waves of different frequencies from it
*   [incoherent scatter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incoherent_scatter "Incoherent scatter") radars such as the [EISCAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EISCAT "EISCAT"), Sondre Stromfjord, [Millstone Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millstone_Hill_Observatory "Millstone Hill Observatory"), [Arecibo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arecibo_Telescope "Arecibo Telescope"), Advanced Modular Incoherent Scatter Radar (AMISR) and [Jicamarca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jicamarca_Radio_Observatory "Jicamarca Radio Observatory") radars
*   coherent scatter radars such as the [Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Dual_Auroral_Radar_Network "Super Dual Auroral Radar Network") radars
*   special receivers to detect how the reflected waves have changed from the transmitted waves.

A variety of experiments, such as HAARP ([High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Frequency_Active_Auroral_Research_Program "High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program")), involve high power radio transmitters to modify the properties of the ionosphere. These investigations focus on studying the properties and behavior of ionospheric plasma, with particular emphasis on being able to understand and use it to enhance communications and surveillance systems for both civilian and military purposes. HAARP was started in 1993 as a proposed twenty-year experiment, and is currently active near Gakona, Alaska.

The SuperDARN radar project researches the high- and mid-latitudes using coherent backscatter of radio waves in the 8 to 20 MHz range. Coherent backscatter is similar to Bragg scattering in crystals and involves the constructive interference of scattering from ionospheric density irregularities. The project involves more than 11 countries and multiple radars in both hemispheres.

Scientists are also examining the ionosphere by the changes to radio waves, from satellites and stars, passing through it. The [Arecibo Telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arecibo_Telescope "Arecibo Telescope") located in [Puerto Rico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rico "Puerto Rico"), was originally intended to study Earth's ionosphere.

Ionograms show the virtual heights and **critical frequencies** of the ionospheric layers and which are measured by an [ionosonde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosonde "Ionosonde"). An ionosonde sweeps a range of frequencies, usually from 0.1 to 30 MHz, transmitting at vertical incidence to the ionosphere. As the frequency increases, each wave is refracted less by the ionization in the layer, and so each penetrates further before it is reflected. Eventually, a frequency is reached that enables the wave to penetrate the layer without being reflected. For ordinary mode waves, this occurs when the transmitted frequency just exceeds the peak plasma, or critical, frequency of the layer. Tracings of the reflected high frequency radio pulses are known as ionograms. Reduction rules are given in: "URSI Handbook of Ionogram Interpretation and Reduction", edited by [William Roy Piggott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Roy_Piggott "William Roy Piggott") and [Karl Rawer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Rawer "Karl Rawer"), Elsevier Amsterdam, 1961 (translations into Chinese, French, Japanese and Russian are available).

### Incoherent scatter radars

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ionosphere&action=edit&section=26 "Edit section: Incoherent scatter radars")]

[Incoherent scatter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incoherent_scatter "Incoherent scatter") radars operate above the critical frequencies. Therefore, the technique allows probing the ionosphere, unlike ionosondes, also above the electron density peaks. The thermal fluctuations of the electron density scattering the transmitted signals lack [coherence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics) "Coherence (physics)"), which gave the technique its name. Their power spectrum contains information not only on the density, but also on the ion and electron temperatures, ion masses and drift velocities. [Incoherent scatter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incoherent_scatter "Incoherent scatter") radars can also measure neutral atmosphere movements, such as [atmospheric tides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_tides "Atmospheric tides"), after making assumptions about ion-neutral [collision frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_frequency "Collision frequency") across the [ionospheric dynamo region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionospheric_dynamo_region "Ionospheric dynamo region").[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere#cite_note-40)

### GNSS radio occultation

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ionosphere&action=edit&section=27 "Edit section: GNSS radio occultation")]

[Radio occultation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_occultation "Radio occultation") is a [remote sensing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_sensing "Remote sensing") technique where a [GNSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNSS "GNSS") signal tangentially scrapes the Earth, passing through the atmosphere, and is received by a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite. As the signal passes through the atmosphere, it is refracted, curved and delayed. An LEO satellite samples the total electron content and bending angle of many such signal paths as it watches the GNSS satellite rise or set behind the Earth. Using an Inverse [Abel's transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abel_transform "Abel transform"), a [radial profile](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Radial_profile&action=edit&redlink=1 "Radial profile (page does not exist)") of refractivity at that tangent point on earth can be reconstructed.

Major GNSS radio occultation missions include the [GRACE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_Recovery_and_Climate_Experiment "Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment"), [CHAMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHAMP_(satellite) "CHAMP (satellite)"), and [COSMIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation_Observing_System_for_Meteorology,_Ionosphere,_and_Climate "Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate").

Indices of the ionosphere
-------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ionosphere&action=edit&section=28 "Edit section: Indices of the ionosphere")]

In empirical models of the ionosphere such as Nequick, the following indices are used as indirect indicators of the state of the ionosphere.

F10.7 and R12 are two indices commonly used in ionospheric modelling. Both are valuable for their long historical records covering multiple solar cycles. F10.7 is a measurement of the intensity of solar radio emissions at a frequency of 2800 MHz made using a ground [radio telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_telescope "Radio telescope"). R12 is a 12 months average of daily [sunspot numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunspot_number "Sunspot number"). The two indices have been shown to be correlated with each other.

However, both indices are only indirect indicators of solar ultraviolet and X-ray emissions, which are primarily responsible for causing ionization in the Earth's upper atmosphere. We now have data from the [GOES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GOES "GOES") spacecraft that measures the background **X-ray flux** from the Sun, a parameter more closely related to the ionization levels in the ionosphere.

### Geomagnetic disturbances

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ionosphere&action=edit&section=30 "Edit section: Geomagnetic disturbances")]

*   The _[A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-index "A-index")_- and _[K](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-index "K-index")_-indices are a measurement of the behavior of the horizontal component of the **geomagnetic field**. The _K_-index uses a semi-logarithmic scale from 0 to 9 to measure the strength of the horizontal component of the geomagnetic field. The Boulder _K_-index is measured at the [Boulder Geomagnetic Observatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boulder_Geomagnetic_Observatory "Boulder Geomagnetic Observatory").
*   The geomagnetic activity levels of the Earth are measured by the fluctuation of the Earth's magnetic field in [SI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI "SI") units called [teslas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_(unit) "Tesla (unit)") (or in non-SI [gauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss_(unit) "Gauss (unit)"), especially in older literature). The Earth's magnetic field is measured around the planet by many observatories. The data retrieved is processed and turned into measurement indices. Daily measurements for the entire planet are made available through an estimate of the _A_ p-index, called the _planetary A-index_ (PAI).

Ionospheres of other planets and natural satellites
---------------------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ionosphere&action=edit&section=31 "Edit section: Ionospheres of other planets and natural satellites")]

Objects in the Solar System that have appreciable atmospheres (i.e., all of the major planets and many of the larger [natural satellites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_satellite "Natural satellite")) generally produce ionospheres.[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere#cite_note-41) Planets known to have ionospheres include [Venus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Venus#Upper_atmosphere_and_ionosphere "Atmosphere of Venus"), [Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars "Mars"),[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere#cite_note-42)[Jupiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetosphere_of_Jupiter#Interaction_with_rings_and_moons "Magnetosphere of Jupiter"), [Saturn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn "Saturn"), [Uranus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Uranus#Thermosphere_and_ionosphere "Atmosphere of Uranus"), and [Neptune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neptune "Neptune").

The [atmosphere of Titan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Titan "Atmosphere of Titan") includes an ionosphere that ranges from about 880 to 1,300 km (550 to 810 mi) in altitude and contains carbon compounds.[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere#cite_note-43) Ionospheres have also been observed at [Io](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Io_(moon) "Io (moon)"), [Europa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europa_(moon) "Europa (moon)"), [Ganymede](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganymede_(moon) "Ganymede (moon)"), [Triton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triton_(moon) "Triton (moon)"), and [Pluto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluto "Pluto").

[_Resultate aus den Beobachtungen des Magnetischen Vereins im Jahre 1838_](https://books.google.com/books?id=TYI5AAAAcAAJ&pg=PA50) [_Findings from the Observations of the Magnetic Society in the Year 1838_] (in German). Leipzig, (Germany): Weidmanns' Bookshop. pp.1–57. Gauss speculated that magnetic forces might be generated not only by electrical currents flowing through the Earth's interior but also by some sort of electrical current(s) flowing through the atmosphere. From p. 50: _"§ 36. Ein anderer Theil unserer Theorie, über welchen ein Zweifel Statt finden kann, ist die Voraussetzung, … zu untersuchen, wie die aus denselben hervorgehende magnetische Wirkung auf der Erdoberfläche sich gestalten würde."_ (Another part of our theory about which doubt may arise is the assumption that the agents of terrestrial magnetic force have their source exclusively in the interior of the Earth. If the immediate causes [of terrestrial magnetism] should be sought entirely or in part outside [the Earth's interior], then we can — in so far as we exclude baseless fantasies and we want to restrict ourselves to the scientifically known [facts] — consider only galvanic currents. Atmospheric air is not a conductor of such currents; empty space also is not: thus our knowledge fails us when we seek a carrier for galvanic currents in the upper regions [of the atmosphere]. Only the enigmatic phenomena of the northern lights — in which by all appearances electricity in motion plays a major role — prohibits us from simply denying the possibility of such currents just on account of that ignorance, and in any case it remains interesting to investigate how the magnetic effect resulting from [those currents] would manifest itself on the Earth's surface.)

Speaking of wireless telegraphy, Heaviside speculated about the propagation of Hertzian (radio) waves through the atmosphere. From p. 215: "There may possibly be a sufficiently conducting layer in the upper air. If so, the waves will, so to speak, catch on to it more or less. Then the guidance will be the sea on one side and the upper layer on the other."

Berg](https://worldradiohistory.com/BOOKSHELF-ARH/On-The-Short-Waves.pdf) Quote: "...In addition to having to obtain licenses - a constraint to which they adapted only slowly - the amateurs were, with some exceptions, restricted to the range below 200 meters (that is, above 1500 kc.), bands that were largely unexplored and thought to be of little value. The navy attributed most interference to the amateurs, and was happy to see them on the road to a hoped - for extinction. From the amateurs' point of view, their development of the shortwave spectrum began less as a love affair than a shotgun marriage. However, all that would change...It took several years before experimenters ventured above 2-3 mc. and started to understand such things as shortwave propagation and directionality. The short waves, as they were called, were surrounded with mystery...Also in 1928 Radio News publisher Hugo Gernsback began shortwave broadcasting on 9700 kc. from his station, WRNY, New York, using the call W2XAL. "A reader in New South Wales, Aus- tralia," reported Gernsback, "writes us that while he was writing his letter he was listening to WRNY's short-wave transmitter, 2XAL, on a three-tube set; and had to turn down the volume, otherwise he would wake up his family. All this at a distance of some 10,000 miles! Yet 2XAL ...uses less than 500 watts; a quite negligible amount of power. "6...The 1930s were the golden age of shortwave broadcasting...Shortwave also facilitated communication with people in remote areas. Amateur radio became a basic ingredient of all expeditions...The term shortwave was generally taken to refer to anything above 1.5 mc., without upper limit...", [backup](https://web.archive.org/web/20210703104647/https://worldradiohistory.com/BOOKSHELF-ARH/On-The-Short-Waves.pdf)
