[ 1 ] History [ edit ] Memorial plaque to Nicolaus Copernicus The church was founded in 1288 by Polish monarch Henryk IV Probus , who was eventually buried in the church after his death in 1290, when the church was still under construction.

[ 4 ] Construction was continued by, among others, bishop Nanker and parish priest Jan Stanko.

[ 4 ] The upper church (Holy Cross Church) contains an epitaph of bishop Nanker. 15h-century Polish chronicler Jan Długosz described the church as "beautiful and magnificent" following his visits in Wrocław.

[ 4 ] From 1502 to 1538 renown astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus was a member of the collegiate chapter.

[ 4 ] In 1821 Polish poet Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz listened to a Polish sermon in the church.

[ 4 ] After World War II , the lower church (St. Bartholomew Church) was used by ethnic Germans until 1956 and later by the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church until 1997.
