N verify ( what is Y N ?) Infobox references Chemical compound N -Acetylglucosamine molecule N -Acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) is an amide derivative of the monosaccharide glucose .  It is a secondary amide between glucosamine and acetic acid . It is significant in several biological systems.

It is part of a biopolymer in the bacterial cell wall , which is built from alternating units of GlcNAc and N -acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc), cross-linked with oligopeptides at the lactic acid residue of MurNAc. This layered structure is called peptidoglycan (formerly called murein).

GlcNAc is the monomeric unit of the polymer chitin , which forms the exoskeletons of arthropods like insects and crustaceans . It is the main component of the radulas of mollusks , the beaks of cephalopods , and a major component of the cell walls of most fungi .

Polymerized with glucuronic acid , it forms hyaluronan .

GlcNAc has been reported to be an inhibitor of elastase release from human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (range 8–17% inhibition), however this is much weaker than the inhibition seen with N -acetylgalactosamine (range 92–100%).

[ 1 ] Medical uses [ edit ] It has been proposed as a treatment for autoimmune diseases and recent tests have claimed some success.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] O -GlcNAcylation [ edit ] Main article: O-GlcNAc O -GlcNAcylation is the process of adding a single N -acetylglucosamine sugar to the serine or threonine of a protein.

[ 4 ] Comparable to phosphorylation , addition or removal of N -acetylglucosamine is a means of activating or deactivating enzymes or transcription factors .

[ 4 ] In fact, O -GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation often compete for the same serine/threonine sites.

[ 4 ] O -GlcNAcylation most often occurs on chromatin proteins, and is often seen as a response to stress.

[ 4 ] Hyperglycemia increases O -GlcNAcylation, leading to insulin resistance .

[ 5 ] Increased O -GlcNAcylation due to hyperglycemia is evidently a dysfunctional form of O -GlcNAcylation.

O -GlcNAcylation decline in the brain with age is associated with cognitive decline . When O -GlcNAcylation was increased in the hippocampus of aged mice, spatial learning and memory improved.
