In mathematics , elementary functions are those functions that are most commonly encountered by beginners. They are typically real functions of a single real variable that can be defined by applying the operations of addition , multiplication , division , n th root , and function composition to polynomial , exponential , logarithm , and trigonometric functions. They include inverse trigonometric functions , hyperbolic functions and inverse hyperbolic functions , which can be expressed in terms of logarithms and exponential function.

All elementary functions have derivatives of any order, which are also elementary, and can be algorithmically computed by applying the differentiation rules . The Taylor series of an elementary function converges in a neighborhood of every point of its domain.  More generally, they are global analytic functions , defined (possibly with multiple values, such as the elementary function z {\displaystyle {\sqrt {z}}} or log ⁡ ⁡ z {\displaystyle \log z} ) for every complex argument, except at isolated points . In contrast, antiderivatives of elementary functions need not be elementary and is difficult to decide whether a specific elementary function has an elementary antiderivative.

In an attempt to solve this problem, Joseph Liouville introduced in 1833 a definition of elementary functions that extends the above one and is commonly accepted: [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] An elementary function is a function that can be built, using addition, multiplication, division, and function composition, from constant functions , exponential functions, the complex logarithm , and roots of polynomials with elementary functions as coefficients. This includes the trigonometric functions, since, for example, ⁠ cos ⁡ ⁡ x = e i x + e − − i x 2 {\displaystyle \textstyle \cos x={\frac {e^{ix}+e^{-ix}}{2}}} ⁠ , as well as every algebraic function .

Liouville's result is that, if an elementary function has an elementary antiderivative, then this antiderivative is a linear combination of logarithms, where the coefficients and the arguments of the logarithms are elementary functions involved, in some sense, in the definition of the function. More than 130 years later, Risch algorithm , named after Robert Henry Risch , is an algorithm to decide whether an elementary function has an elementary antiderivative, and, if it has, to compute this antiderivative. Despite dealing with elementary functions, the Risch algorithm is far from elementary; as of 2025 [update] , it seems that no complete implementation is available.

Examples [ edit ] Basic examples [ edit ] Elementary functions of a single variable x include: Constant functions : 2 , π π , e , {\displaystyle 2,\ \pi ,\ e,} the Euler–Mascheroni constant , Apéry's constant , Khinchin's constant , etc.  Any constant real (or complex) number.

Powers of ⁠ x {\displaystyle x} ⁠ : x α α = e α α log ⁡ ⁡ x {\displaystyle x^{\alpha }=e^{\alpha \log x}} etc. (The exponent can be any real or complex constant.) Exponential functions : e x , a x = e x log ⁡ ⁡ a {\displaystyle \textstyle e^{x},\quad a^{x}=e^{x\log a}} Logarithms : log ⁡ ⁡ x , log a ⁡ ⁡ x = log ⁡ ⁡ x log ⁡ ⁡ a {\displaystyle \textstyle \log x,\quad \log _{a}x={\frac {\log x}{\log a}}} Trigonometric functions : sin ⁡ ⁡ x = e i x − − e − − i x 2 i , cos ⁡ ⁡ x = e i x + e − − i x 2 , tan ⁡ ⁡ x = sin ⁡ ⁡ x cos ⁡ ⁡ x , {\displaystyle \textstyle \sin x={\frac {e^{ix}-e^{-ix}}{2i}},\ \cos x={\frac {e^{ix}+e^{-ix}}{2}},\ \tan x={\frac {\sin x}{\cos x}},\ } etc.

Inverse trigonometric functions : arcsin ⁡ ⁡ x , arccos ⁡ ⁡ x , {\displaystyle \arcsin x,\ \arccos x,} etc.

Hyperbolic functions : sinh ⁡ ⁡ x , cosh ⁡ ⁡ x , {\displaystyle \sinh x,\ \cosh x,} etc.

Inverse hyperbolic functions : arsinh ⁡ ⁡ x , arcosh ⁡ ⁡ x , {\displaystyle \operatorname {arsinh} x,\ \operatorname {arcosh} x,} etc.

All functions obtained by adding, subtracting, multiplying or dividing a finite number of any of the previous functions [ 4 ] All functions obtained as roots of a polynomial whose coefficients are elementary functions [ 5 ] [ 6 ] All functions obtained by composing a finite number of any of the previously listed functions Certain elementary functions of a single complex variable z , such as z {\displaystyle {\sqrt {z}}} and log ⁡ ⁡ z {\displaystyle \log z} , may be multivalued . Additionally, certain classes of functions may be obtained by others using the final two rules. For example, the exponential function e z {\displaystyle e^{z}} composed with addition, subtraction, and division provides the hyperbolic functions, while initial composition with i z {\displaystyle iz} instead provides the trigonometric functions.

Composite examples [ edit ] Examples of elementary functions include: Addition, e.g. ( x + 1) Multiplication, e.g. (2 x ) Polynomial functions e tan ⁡ ⁡ x 1 + x 2 sin ⁡ ⁡ ( 1 + ( log ⁡ ⁡ x ) 2 ) {\displaystyle {\frac {e^{\tan x}}{1+x^{2}}}\sin \left({\sqrt {1+(\log x)^{2}}}\right)} − − i log ⁡ ⁡ ( x + i 1 − − x 2 ) {\displaystyle -i\log \left(x+i{\sqrt {1-x^{2}}}\right)} The last function is equal to arccos ⁡ ⁡ x {\displaystyle \arccos x} , the inverse cosine , in the entire complex plane .

All monomials , polynomials , rational functions and algebraic functions are elementary.

Non-elementary functions [ edit ] All elementary functions are analytic , unlike the absolute value function or discontinuous functions such as the step function .

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] Some have proposed extending the set to include, for example, the Lambert W function [ 9 ] or elliptic functions , [ 10 ] all of which are still analytic.

Not every analytic function is elementary. Some examples that are not elementary, under standard definitions: tetration the gamma function non-elementary Liouvillian functions , including the exponential integral ( Ei ), logarithmic integral ( Li or li ) and Fresnel integrals ( S and C ).

the error function , e r f ( x ) = 2 π π ∫ ∫ 0 x e − − t 2 d t , {\displaystyle \mathrm {erf} (x)={\frac {2}{\sqrt {\pi }}}\int _{0}^{x}e^{-t^{2}}\,dt,} a fact that may not be immediately obvious, but can be proven using the Risch algorithm .

other nonelementary integrals , including the Dirichlet integral and elliptic integral .

Closure [ edit ] It follows directly from the definition that the set of elementary functions is closed under arithmetic operations, (algebraic) root extraction and composition. The elementary functions are closed under differentiation . They are not closed under limits and infinite sums . Importantly, the elementary functions are not closed under integration , as shown by Liouville's theorem , see nonelementary integral . The Liouvillian functions are defined as the elementary functions and, recursively, the integrals of the Liouvillian functions.

Differential algebra [ edit ] The mathematical definition of an elementary function , or a function in elementary form, is considered in the context of differential algebra .  A differential algebra is an algebra with the extra operation of derivation (algebraic version of differentiation).  Using the derivation operation new equations can be written and their solutions used in extensions of the algebra.  By starting with the field of rational functions , two special types of transcendental extensions (the logarithm and the exponential) can be added to the field building a tower containing elementary functions.

A differential field F is a field F 0 (rational functions over the rationals Q for example) together with a derivation map u → ∂ u .  (Here ∂ u is a new function. Sometimes the notation u ′ is used.) The derivation captures the properties of differentiation, so that for any two elements of the base field, the derivation is linear ∂ ∂ ( u + v ) = ∂ ∂ u + ∂ ∂ v {\displaystyle \partial (u+v)=\partial u+\partial v} and satisfies the Leibniz product rule ∂ ∂ ( u ⋅ ⋅ v ) = ∂ ∂ u ⋅ ⋅ v + u ⋅ ⋅ ∂ ∂ v .

{\displaystyle \partial (u\cdot v)=\partial u\cdot v+u\cdot \partial v\,.} An element h is a constant if ∂h = 0 .   If the base field is over the rationals, care must be taken when extending the field to add the needed transcendental constants.

A function u of a differential extension F [ u ] of a differential field F is an elementary function over F if the function u is algebraic over F , or is an exponential , that is, ∂ u = u ∂ a for a ∈ F , or is a logarithm , that is, ∂ u = ∂ a / a for a ∈ F .
