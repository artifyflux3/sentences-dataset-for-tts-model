It originates from some of the work of or all of the work of the mid-to-late 19th century works of German philosophers Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels .

According to Marxist perspective, class conflicts conditions the evolution of modes of production , such as the development of slavery to feudalism to capitalism , and as such, the contradictions of capitalism demands the organization of the proletariat to establish a communist society through revolution and maintenance of the dictatorship of the proletariat . Marxism has since developed into different branches and schools of thought, and there is now no single definitive Marxist theory.

The German Marxists extended the theory to groups and issues Marx had barely touched. Marxian analyses of the legal system, of the social role of women, of foreign trade, of international rivalries among capitalist nations, and the role of parliamentary democracy in the transition to socialism drew animated debates ... Marxian theory (singular) gave way to Marxian theories (plural).
