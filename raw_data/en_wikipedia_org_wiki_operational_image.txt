Operational images are not intended to be viewed by people as representations of the real world; they are created to be used as instruments in performing some task or operation, often by machine automation. Operational images are used in a wide variety of applications, such as weapons targeting and guidance systems, and assisting surgeons performing robot-assisted surgery .

The term "operational image" was first coined in 2000 by German filmmaker Harun Farocki in the first part of his three-part audiovisual installation, Eye/Machine . Farocki's installation included operational images used by militaries, such as weapons guidance and targeting systems.

Eye/Machine featured images shown to the public by the United States military from the cameras used by laser-guided missiles in the Gulf War .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Farocki defined operational images as "Images without a social goal, not for edification, not for reflection," [ 1 ] and that they "do not represent an object, but rather are part of an operation." [ 2 ] According to Volker Pantenburg, operational images are more accurately characterized as "visualizations of data". He describes operational images as a "working image" or an image that "performs work".

[ 1 ] Operational images are ubiquitous in modern society, [ 2 ] used for a variety of military and non-military applications, such as inspecting sewer piping, and assisting surgeons performing robotic surgery.
