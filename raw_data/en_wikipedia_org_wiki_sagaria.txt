Sagaria Temporal range: Albian PreꞒ Ꞓ O S D C P T J K Pg N Scientific classification Kingdom: Plantae (unranked): Angiosperms (unranked): Eudicots Order: Ranunculales Family: Ranunculaceae Genus: Sagaria Bravi, Barone Lumaga & Mickle, 2010 Sagaria is an extinct genus of flowering plant in the Ranunculaceae (the buttercup family) which existed in southern Italy during the Albian age.

[ 1 ] The type species is Sagaria cilentana .

Taxonomy [ edit ] The genus was erected based on a single specimen (part and counterpart) retrieved from an exposure in the Alburni mountains near Petina , in the Campania region. The locality was already known for both crustacean and plant fossils.

[ 2 ] The name is dedicated to the collector of the specimen, Giovanni Sagaria.
