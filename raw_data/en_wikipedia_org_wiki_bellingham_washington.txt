[ 10 ] It lies 21 miles (34 km) south of the U.S.–Canada border , between Vancouver , British Columbia, 52 miles (84 km) to the northwest and Seattle 90 miles (140 km) to the south.

The population was 91,482 at the 2020 census , [ 6 ] and estimated to be 94,720 in 2023.

[ 11 ] It is the site of Western Washington University , Bellingham International Airport , and the southern terminus of the Alaska Marine Highway . Bellingham is the northernmost city with a population of more than 90,000 people in the contiguous United States .

[ 12 ] The area around Bellingham Bay , named in 1792 by George Vancouver , is the ancestral home of several Coast Salish groups. European settlement in modern-day Bellingham began in the 1850s and several coal mining towns grew in later years. The city of Bellingham was incorporated in 1903 through the consolidation of several settlements, among them Fairhaven . Local industries shifted away from coal in the mid-20th century; the industrial areas on the Bellingham waterfront have undergone redevelopment into a mixed-use neighborhood since the 2000s.

History [ edit ] This article is missing information about events after 1907.

( January 2025 ) Main article: History of Bellingham, Washington Boatbuilding at Pacific American Fisheries yard in Bellingham, 1916 An old bank building, built in 1900 in the Fairhaven Historic District Bellingham has been inhabited by Indigenous peoples for millennia. The city of Bellingham and its surrounding area is the intersection of the territories of many Coast Salishan peoples. The Lummi , Nooksack , Samish , and Nuwhaha in particular fished in Bellingham Bay and shared the hunting and gathering grounds in the nearby forests and prairies.

[ 13 ] Indigenous people continue to live in and around Bellingham, particularly the Lummi, who have a reservation directly west of the city.

The modern city of Bellingham, incorporated in 1903, consolidated four settlements: Bellingham, Whatcom, Fairhaven, and Sehome. It takes its name from Bellingham Bay , named by George Vancouver in 1792, for Sir William Bellingham .

The first European immigrants reached the area about 1852 when Henry Roeder and Russel Peabody set up a lumber mill at Whatcom, now the northern part of Bellingham. Lumber cutting and milling continues to the present in Whatcom county. At about the same time, Dan Harris arrived, claiming a homestead along Padden Creek, and after acquiring surrounding properties, platted the town of Fairhaven in 1883. In 1858, the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush caused a short lived population growth that established the community.

Coal was mined in the Bellingham Bay area from the mid-19th to the mid-20th centuries starting when Henry Roeder's agents discovered coal south of Whatcom Creek, in an area called Sehome, now downtown Bellingham, in 1854. They sold the coal-bearing land to San Francisco investors who established the Bellingham Bay Coal Company, eventually a subsidiary of the Black Diamond Coal Mining Company . After a hundred years of extensive mining beneath present-day Bellingham, the last mine closed in 1955.

[ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] In the early 1890s, three railroad lines arrived, connecting the bay cities to a nationwide market of builders. In 1889, Pierre Cornwall and an association of investors formed the Bellingham Bay Improvement Company (BBIC). The BBIC invested in several diverse enterprises such as shipping, coal, mining, railroad construction, real estate sales and utilities. Even though their dreams of turning the cities by the bay into a Pacific Northwest metropolis never came to fruition, the BBIC made an immense contribution to the economic development of Bellingham.

[ 17 ] BBIC was not the only outside firm with an interest in the bay area utilities. The General Electric Company of New York purchased the Fairhaven Line and New Whatcom street rail line in 1897. In 1898, the utility merged into the Northern Railway and Improvement Company which prompted the Electric Corporation of Boston to purchase a large block of shares.

[ 18 ] In 1890, Fairhaven developers bought the tiny community of Bellingham. Whatcom and Sehome merged in 1891 to form New Whatcom (1903 act of the State legislature dropped "New" from the name.) At first, attempts to combine Fairhaven and Whatcom failed, and there was controversy over the name of the proposed new city. Whatcom citizens would not support a city named Fairhaven , and Fairhaven residents would not support a city named Whatcom . They eventually settled on the name Bellingham , which remains today. Voting a second time for a final merger of Fairhaven and Whatcom into a single city, the resolution passed with 2163 votes for and 596 against.

[ 19 ] Bellingham was officially incorporated on December 28, 1903, [ 20 ] as a result of the incremental consolidation of the four towns initially situated on the east of Bellingham Bay during the final decade of the 19th Century. Whatcom is today's "Old Town" area and was founded with Roeder's Mill in 1852.

[ 21 ] Sehome was an area of downtown founded with the Sehome Coal Mine in 1854. Bellingham was further south near Boulevard Park, founded in 1883 and purchased in 1890 by Fairhaven.

Fairhaven was a large commercial district with its own harbor, founded in 1883, by Dan Harris , around his initial homestead on Padden Creek.

Bellingham was the site of the Bellingham riots against East Indian ( Sikh ) immigrant workers in 1907. A mob of 400–500 white men, predominantly members of the Asiatic Exclusion League , with intentions to exclude East Indian immigrants from the work force of the local lumber mills, attacked the homes of the South Asian Indians. The Indians were mostly Sikhs but were labeled as Hindus by much of the media of the day.

[ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] Bellingham's proximity to the Strait of Juan de Fuca and to the Inside Passage to Alaska helped to retain some cannery operations. Pacific American Fisheries (P.A.F.), for example, shipped empty cans to Alaska, where they were packed with fish and shipped back.

[ citation needed ] Bellingham circa 1909 Bellingham, 2010 Geography [ edit ] The city is situated on Bellingham Bay which is protected by Lummi Island , Portage Island , and the Lummi Peninsula, and opens onto the Strait of Georgia . It lies west of Mount Baker and Lake Whatcom (from which it gets its drinking water) and north of the Chuckanut Mountains and the Skagit Valley .

Whatcom Creek runs through the center of the city. Bellingham is 18 miles (29 km) south of the US-Canada border and 50 miles (80 km) southeast of Vancouver.

According to the United States Census Bureau , the city has a total area of 30.511 square miles (79.02 km 2 ), of which, 28.198 square miles (73.03 km 2 ) is land and 2.313 square miles (5.99 km 2 ) is water.

[ 3 ] The lowest elevations are at sea level along the waterfront. Alabama Hill is one of the higher points in the city at about 500 feet (150 m). Elevations of 800 feet (240 m) are found near Yew Street Hill north of Lake Padden and near Galbraith Mountain. South and eastward of the city limits are taller foothills of the North Cascades mountains.

Mount Baker is the largest peak in the local area, with a summit elevation of 10,778 feet (3,285 m) that is only 31 miles (50 km) from Bellingham Bay. Mount Baker is visible from many parts of the city and western Whatcom County. Lake Whatcom forms part of the eastern boundary of the city, while many smaller lakes and wetland areas are found around the region.

[ citation needed ] Situated at a latitude of 48.75 North, and thus north of the 48°34' parallel , Bellingham is one of only a few cities in the continental United States that experience astronomical twilight for the entire night. The phenomenon occurs every year between June 14 and 28.

[ citation needed ] Bellingham's neighborhoods are Alabama Hill, Barkley, Birchwood, Columbia, Cordata, Cornwall Park, Downtown Central Business District, Edgemoor, Fairhaven , Happy Valley, Irongate, King Mountain, Lettered Streets, Meridian, Puget, Roosevelt, Samish, Sehome, Silver Beach, South, South Hill, Sunnyland, Whatcom Falls, Western Washington University (WWU) (including the campus), and York.

The city is strongly influenced by the Cascade Range and Olympic Mountains . The Cascades to the east block continental influence, while the Olympics provide a rain shadow effect that buffers Bellingham from much of the rainfall approaching from the southwest.

Bellingham receives an average annual rainfall of 34.84 inches (885 mm), which is slightly less than nearby Seattle. November is typically the wettest month, with numerous frontal rainstorms. Still, precipitation is distributed throughout the rainy period extending from October through April.

[ 26 ] Bellingham has the lowest average sunshine amount of any city in the US.

[ 27 ] Despite this, Bellingham has fewer overcast days on average than Seattle (SeaTac), Everett (Paine Field) and Olympia.

[ 28 ] The hottest summer days rarely exceed 90 °F (32 °C) and the warmest temperature on record is 100 °F (38 °C) on August 12, 2021. This is markedly cooler than the record high for Seattle (108 °F (42 °C)) and most other Washington locations. Drought is rare, although some summers are noticeably drier than others and some normally reliable wells have been known to run dry in August and September. Nevertheless, crops are more frequently ruined by too much rain rather than too little.

Bellingham's proximity to the Fraser River valley occasionally subjects it to a harsh winter weather pattern (termed a 'north-Easter') wherein an upper-level trough drives cold Arctic air from the Canadian interior southwesterly through the Fraser River Canyon. Such an event was recorded on November 28, 2006, when air temperatures of 12 °F (−11 °C) were accompanied by 30 to 48 miles per hour (48 to 77 km/h) winds. Wind chill values reached −10 °F (−23 °C) according to NOAA .

[ 29 ] Several days into this pattern, local ponds and smaller lakes freeze solidly enough to allow skating. These outflow winds also can collide with Gulf of Alaska moisture and create ice, snow, or heavy rains; the freezing rain can create a phenomenon referred to as a "silver thaw" that produces hazardous roads among other inconveniences.

Its reverse, the " Pineapple Express ", refers to acutely mild autumn and winter spells – for most of such a spell, an unusually warm and steady wind comes out of the south. It will typically follow several days of Arctic northeast outflow winds, and it can melt significant snow accumulations quickly, pushing drainage systems to their limits.

[ 81 ] According to Aaron Terrazas, senior economist at Zillow, "Given the area's pace of growth, it would require very aggressive building to keep rent affordability in check." [ 82 ] The city has resisted expanding the Urban Growth Area for many years, [ 83 ] and hopes to fit both multi-family and single-family growth within the city limits.

[ 81 ] Builders counter that even City planners acknowledge that the city is "largely built out" and that the remaining land is difficult or expensive to build on.

[ 84 ] Attempts to increase density, ease restrictions on 'accessory dwelling units', [ 85 ] or even to develop land already zoned residential, are regularly met with fierce neighborhood opposition: Padden Trails was opposed by the Samish Neighborhood Association; [ 86 ] [ 87 ] a dense development at the Sunnyland D.O.T. site was scaled-down; [ 88 ] Fairhaven neighbors led the effort to prevent the development of Fairhaven Highlands, [ 89 ] (now Chuckanut Ridge), which the City ended up purchasing for $8.2 million, [ 90 ] preventing more than 700 new housing units; [ 91 ] neighborhood groups pressured the City Council to go against staff recommendation to rezone Squalicum Lofts for residential development.

[ 95 ] Georgia-Pacific (G-P) purchased the Puget Sound Pulp and Timber Company in 1963 and operated a pulp mill on the central downtown waterfront until 2001. In 1965, G-P built a chlor-alkali facility, which became a source of mercury contamination in the Whatcom Waterway and on the uplands of the site for decades. The documentary film, "Smells Like Money – The Story of Bellingham's Georgia Pacific Plant" [ 96 ] tells the story of the site, which has since been purchased by the Port of Bellingham chiefly to create a marina in the 37-acre (15 ha) wastewater lagoon.

[ citation needed ] The Port of Bellingham purchased the G-P site for $10 with the understanding that the port would assume liability for the contamination.

[ 97 ] The City of Bellingham and the Port of Bellingham entered into several interlocal agreements in which the City agreed to pay for all infrastructure costs, and the Port would create a marina, clean up the site, and retain all zoning.

[ citation needed ] The cleanup site (approximately 74 acres (30 ha)) was divided into two areas: pulp and tissue mill area and the chlor-alkali area. Contaminated soils and building materials were removed in 2011 and 2013; the Department of Ecology finalized the Interim Cleanup Work Plan in January 2017, [ 98 ] and that work was completed in April 2017 when 31 acres were capped with a protective barrier.
