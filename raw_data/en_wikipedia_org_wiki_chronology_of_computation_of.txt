The table below is a brief chronology of computed numerical values of, or bounds on, the mathematical constant pi . For more detailed explanations for some of these calculations, see Approximations of π .

As of May 2025, π has been calculated to 300,000,000,000,000 decimal digits.

F. Ferguson in 1946).

527 1882 Ferdinand von Lindemann Proved that π is transcendental (the Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem ) 1897 The U.S. state of Indiana Came close to legislating the value 3.2 (among others) for π .

House Bill No. 246 passed unanimously. The bill stalled in the state Senate due to a suggestion of possible commercial motives involving publication of a textbook.

Since the 1980s, his series have become the basis for the fastest algorithms currently used by Yasumasa Kanada and the Chudnovsky brothers to compute π .
