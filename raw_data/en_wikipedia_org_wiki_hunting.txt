[Bushmen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_people "San people")[bowhunting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowhunting "Bowhunting") for [bushmeat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushmeat "Bushmeat") in [Botswana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana "Botswana")

**Hunting** is the [human practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_activity "Human activity") of seeking, pursuing, capturing, and killing [wildlife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife "Wildlife") or [feral animals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feral_animal "Feral animal").[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-10) The most common reasons for humans to hunt are to obtain the animal's body for [meat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat "Meat") and useful [animal products](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_product "Animal product") ([fur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fur "Fur")/[hide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hide_(skin) "Hide (skin)"), [bone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone "Bone")/[tusks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tusk "Tusk"), [horn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horn_(anatomy) "Horn (anatomy)")/[antler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antler "Antler"), etc.), for [recreation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreation "Recreation")/[taxidermy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxidermy "Taxidermy") (see [trophy hunting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trophy_hunting "Trophy hunting")), although it may also be done for resourceful reasons such as removing [predators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predator "Predator") dangerous to humans or [domestic animals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_animal "Domestic animal") (e.g. [wolf hunting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf_hunting "Wolf hunting")), to [eliminate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pest_control "Pest control")[pests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pest_(organism) "Pest (organism)") and [nuisance animals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuisance_animal "Nuisance animal") that damage [crops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crop "Crop")/[livestock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestock "Livestock")/[poultry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry "Poultry") or [spread diseases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoonosis "Zoonosis") (see [varminting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varmint_hunting "Varmint hunting")), for trade/tourism (see [safari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safari "Safari")), or for [ecological conservation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_biology "Conservation biology") against [overpopulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overpopulation "Overpopulation") and [invasive species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species "Invasive species") (commonly called a [cull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culling#Wildlife "Culling")).

Recreationally hunted species are generally referred to as the _[game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game\_(food) "Game (food)")_, and are usually [mammals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal "Mammal") and [birds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird "Bird"). A person participating in a hunt is a **hunter** or (less commonly) **huntsman**; a [natural area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_area "Natural area") used for hunting is called a [game reserve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_reserve "Game reserve"); and an experienced hunter who helps organise a hunt and/or manage the game reserve is also known as a [gamekeeper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamekeeper "Gamekeeper").

Hunting activities by humans arose in _[Homo erectus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo\_erectus "Homo erectus")_ or earlier, in the order of millions of years ago. Hunting has become deeply embedded in various [human cultures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_culture "Human culture") and was once an important part of [rural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural "Rural") economies—classified by economists as part of [primary production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_production_(economics) "Primary production (economics)") alongside [forestry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forestry "Forestry"), [agriculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture "Agriculture"), and [fishery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishery "Fishery"). Modern regulations (see [game law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_law "Game law")) distinguish lawful hunting activities from illegal [poaching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poaching "Poaching"), which involves the unauthorised and unregulated [killing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_animals "Killing of animals"), [trapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapping "Trapping"), or capture of animals.

Apart from [food](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food "Food") provision, hunting can be a means of [population control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_control "Population control"). Hunting advocates state that regulated hunting can be a necessary component[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-:4-11) of modern [wildlife management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife_management "Wildlife management"), for example to help maintain a healthy proportion of animal populations within an environment's ecological [carrying capacity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrying_capacity "Carrying capacity") when natural checks such as [natural predators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_predator "Natural predator") are absent or insufficient,[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-12)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-13) or to provide funding for [breeding programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breeding_program "Breeding program") and maintenance of [natural reserves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_reserve "Natural reserve") and [conservation parks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_area "Conservation area"). However, [excessive hunting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overhunting "Overhunting") has also heavily contributed to the [endangerment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_species "Endangered species"), [extirpation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_extinction "Local extinction") and [extinction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction "Extinction") of many animals.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-14)[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-IUCN_Red_List_2010-15) Some [animal rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal-rights "Animal-rights") and [anti-hunting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-hunting "Anti-hunting") activists regard hunting as a [cruel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruelty_to_animals "Cruelty to animals"), [perverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoosadism "Zoosadism") and unnecessary [blood sport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sport "Blood sport").[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-:1-16)[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-:2-17) Certain hunting practices, such as [canned hunts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canned_hunt "Canned hunt") and [ludicrously paid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidding_war "Bidding war")/[bribed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery "Bribery")[trophy tours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safari "Safari") (especially to poor countries), are considered [unethical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_chase "Fair chase") and [exploitative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_exploitation "Economic exploitation") even by some hunters.

[Marine mammals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_mammal "Marine mammal") such as [whales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale "Whale") and [pinnipeds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinniped "Pinniped") are also targets of hunting, both recreationally and commercially, often with heated controversies regarding the morality, ethics and legality of such practices. The pursuit, harvesting or [catch and release](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catch_and_release "Catch and release") of [fish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish "Fish") and [aquatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquatic_animal "Aquatic animal")[cephalopods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephalopod "Cephalopod") and [crustaceans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crustacean "Crustacean") is called [fishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing "Fishing"), which however is widely accepted and not commonly categorised as a form of hunting. It is also not considered hunting to pursue animals without intent to kill them, as in [wildlife photography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife_photography "Wildlife photography"), [birdwatching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birdwatching "Birdwatching"), or scientific-research activities which involve [tranquilizing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tranquillizer_gun "Tranquillizer gun") or [tagging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_tagging "Electronic tagging") of animals, although [green hunting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_hunting "Green hunting") is still called so. The practices of [netting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_net "Butterfly net") or [trapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect_trap "Insect trap")[insects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect "Insect") and other [arthropods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthropod "Arthropod") for [trophy collection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect_collection "Insect collection"), or the [foraging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foraging "Foraging") or [gathering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter-gatherer "Hunter-gatherer") of [plants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant "Plant") and [mushrooms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mushroom "Mushroom"), are also not regarded as hunting.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-18)

Skillful [tracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_tracking "Animal tracking") and acquisition of an elusive target has caused the word _hunt_ to be used in the [vernacular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernacular "Vernacular") as a [metaphor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphor "Metaphor") for searching and obtaining something, as in "[treasure hunting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasure_hunting "Treasure hunting")", "[bargain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discounts_and_allowances "Discounts and allowances") hunting", "[hunting for votes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_campaign "Political campaign")" and even "[hunting down](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punishment "Punishment")" [corruption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption "Corruption") and [waste](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste "Waste").

The word _hunt_ serves as both a [noun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noun "Noun") ("the act, the practice, or an instance of hunting") and a [verb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verb "Verb") ("to pursue for food or in sport").[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-19) The noun has been dated to the early 12th century, from the verb _hunt_. [Old English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English "Old English") had _huntung, huntoþ_.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-:5-20) The meaning of "a body of persons associated for the purpose of hunting with a pack of hounds" is first recorded in the 1570s. "The act of searching for someone or something" is from about 1600.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-:5-20)

The verb, Old English _huntian_ "to chase game" ([transitive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitive_verb "Transitive verb") and [intransitive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intransitive_verb "Intransitive verb")), perhaps developed from _hunta_ "hunter," is related to _hentan_ "to seize," from [Proto-Germanic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Germanic_language "Proto-Germanic language")_huntojan_ (the source also of [Gothic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_language "Gothic language")_hinþan_ "to seize, capture," [Old High German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_High_German "Old High German")_hunda_ "booty"), which is of uncertain origin. The general sense of "search diligently" (for anything) is first recorded c. 1200.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-21)

### Lower to Middle Paleolithic

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hunting&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Lower to Middle Paleolithic")]

Hunting has a long history. It predates the emergence of _[Homo sapiens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo\_sapiens "Homo sapiens")_ ([anatomically modern humans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomically_modern_humans "Anatomically modern humans")) and may even predate the [genus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus "Genus")_[Homo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo "Homo")_.

The oldest undisputed evidence for hunting dates to the [Early Pleistocene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Pleistocene "Early Pleistocene"), consistent with the emergence and early dispersal of _[Homo erectus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo\_erectus "Homo erectus")_ about 1.7 million years ago ([Acheulean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acheulean "Acheulean")).[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-22) While it is undisputed that _Homo erectus_ were hunters, the importance of this for the emergence of _Homo erectus_ from its australopithecine ancestors, including the production of [stone tools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_tool "Stone tool") and eventually the [control of fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_of_fire "Control of fire"), is emphasised in the so-called "[hunting hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting_hypothesis "Hunting hypothesis")" and de-emphasised in scenarios that stress omnivory and [social interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_interaction "Social interaction").

There is no direct evidence for hunting predating _Homo erectus_, in either _[Homo habilis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo\_habilis "Homo habilis")_ or in _[Australopithecus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australopithecus "Australopithecus")_. The early [hominid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hominidae "Hominidae") ancestors of humans were probably [frugivores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frugivore "Frugivore") or [omnivores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnivore "Omnivore"), with a partially carnivorous diet from [scavenging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scavenging "Scavenging") rather than hunting. Evidence for australopithecine meat consumption was presented in the 1990s.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-23) It has nevertheless often been assumed that at least occasional hunting behaviour may have been present well before the emergence of _Homo_.This can be argued on the basis of comparison with [chimpanzees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_chimpanzee "Common chimpanzee"), the closest extant relatives of humans, who also engage in hunting, indicating that the behavioural trait may have been present in the [Chimpanzee–human last common ancestor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimpanzee%E2%80%93human_last_common_ancestor "Chimpanzee–human last common ancestor") as early as 5 million years ago. The common chimpanzee (_[Pan troglodytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan\_troglodytes "Pan troglodytes")_) regularly engages in troop predation behaviour, where bands of beta males are led by an [alpha male](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_male "Alpha male"). [Bonobos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonobo "Bonobo") (_[Pan paniscus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan\_paniscus "Pan paniscus")_) have also been observed to occasionally engage in group hunting,[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-24) although more rarely than _Pan troglodytes_, mainly subsisting on a [frugivorous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frugivorous "Frugivorous") diet.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-25) Indirect evidence for [Oldowan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oldowan "Oldowan") era hunting, by early _Homo_ or late _[Australopithecus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australopithecus "Australopithecus")_, has been presented in a 2009 study based on an Oldowan site in southwestern Kenya.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-26)

[Louis Binford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Binford "Louis Binford") (1986) criticised the idea that early hominids and early humans were hunters. On the basis of the analysis of the skeletal remains of the consumed animals, he concluded that hominids and early humans were mostly [scavengers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scavengers "Scavengers"), not hunters,[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-27) Blumenschine (1986) proposed the idea of _confrontational scavenging_, which involves challenging and scaring off other [predators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predator "Predator")_after_ they have made a kill, which he suggests could have been the leading method of obtaining [protein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein "Protein")-rich meat by early humans.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-28)

Stone spearheads dated as early as 500,000 years ago were found in South Africa.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-29) Wood does not preserve well, however, and Craig Stanford, a primatologist and professor of anthropology at the [University of Southern California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Southern_California "University of Southern California"), has suggested that the discovery of spear use by chimpanzees probably means that early humans used wooden spears as well, perhaps, five million years ago.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-30) The earliest dated find of surviving wooden hunting [spears](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spear "Spear") dates to the very end of the [Lower Paleolithic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_Paleolithic "Lower Paleolithic"), about 300,000 years ago.

The [hunting hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting_hypothesis "Hunting hypothesis") sees the emergence of [behavioral modernity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_modernity "Behavioral modernity") in the [Middle Paleolithic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Paleolithic "Middle Paleolithic") as directly related to hunting, including [mating behaviour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mating "Mating"), the establishment of [language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language "Language"), culture, and [religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_of_religion "Origin of religion"), [mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mythology "Mythology") and [animal sacrifice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_sacrifice "Animal sacrifice"). Sociologist [David Nibert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Nibert "David Nibert") of [Wittenberg University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wittenberg_University "Wittenberg University") argues that the emergence of the organized hunting of animals undermined the communal, egalitarian nature of early human societies, with the status of women and less powerful males declining as the status of men quickly became associated with their success at hunting, which also increased human violence within these societies.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-32) However, 9000-year-old remains of a female hunter along with a toolkit of [projectile points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projectile_points "Projectile points") and animal processing implements were discovered at the [Andean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andes "Andes") site of Wilamaya Patjxa, [Puno District](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puno_District "Puno District") in [Peru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peru "Peru").[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-33)

Evidence exists that hunting may have been one of the multiple, or possibly main, [environmental factors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_factor "Environmental factor") leading to the [Holocene extinction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene_extinction "Holocene extinction") of [megafauna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megafauna "Megafauna") and their replacement by smaller [herbivores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbivores "Herbivores").[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-34)[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-35)

Humans are thought to have played a very significant role in the extinction of the [Australian megafauna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_megafauna "Australian megafauna") that was widespread prior to human occupation.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-36)[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-37)[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-38)

Hunting was a crucial component of hunter-gatherer societies before the [domestication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestication "Domestication") of [livestock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestock "Livestock") and the [dawn of agriculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic_Revolution "Neolithic Revolution"), beginning about 11,000 years ago in some parts of the world. In addition to the [spear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spear "Spear"), [hunting weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting_weapon "Hunting weapon") developed during the Upper Paleolithic include the [atlatl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlatl "Atlatl") (a spear-thrower; before 30,000 years ago) and the [bow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bow_(weapon) "Bow (weapon)") (18,000 years ago). By the [Mesolithic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesolithic "Mesolithic"), [hunting strategies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting_strategy "Hunting strategy") had diversified with the development of these more far-reaching weapons and the [domestication of the dog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestication_of_the_dog "Domestication of the dog") about 15,000 years ago. Evidence puts the earliest known [mammoth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammoth "Mammoth") hunting in Asia with [spears](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spears "Spears") to approximately 16,200 years ago.[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-39)

Many species of animals have been hunted throughout history. One theory is that in North America and [Eurasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasia "Eurasia"), [caribou and wild reindeer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reindeer "Reindeer") "may well be the species of single greatest importance in the entire anthropological literature on hunting"[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-Burch-40) (see also [Reindeer Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reindeer_Age "Reindeer Age")), although the varying importance of different species depended on the geographic location.

[Mesolithic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesolithic "Mesolithic") hunter-gathering lifestyles remained prevalent in some parts of the [Americas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas "Americas"), [Sub-Saharan Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-Saharan_Africa "Sub-Saharan Africa"), and [Siberia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberia "Siberia"), as well as all of Australia, until the European [Age of Discovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Discovery "Age of Discovery"). They still persist in some [tribal societies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribal_societies "Tribal societies"), albeit in rapid decline. Peoples that preserved Paleolithic hunting-gathering until the recent past include some [indigenous peoples of the Amazonas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_indigenous_peoples_in_Brazil "List of indigenous peoples in Brazil") ([Aché](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ach%C3%A9 "Aché")), some Central and Southern African ([San people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_people "San people")), some peoples of [New Guinea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Guinea "New Guinea") ([Fayu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fayu_people "Fayu people")), the [Mlabri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mlabri_people "Mlabri people") of [Thailand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand "Thailand") and [Laos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laos "Laos"), the [Vedda people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedda_people "Vedda people") of [Sri Lanka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka "Sri Lanka"), and a handful of [uncontacted peoples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncontacted_peoples "Uncontacted peoples").

Even as [animal domestication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestication#Animals "Domestication") became relatively widespread and after the development of agriculture, hunting usually remained a significant contributor to the human food-supply. The supplementary meat and materials from hunting included [protein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein "Protein"), [bone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone "Bone") for implements, [sinew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinew "Sinew") for [cordage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rope "Rope"), [fur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fur "Fur"), [feathers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feathers "Feathers"), [rawhide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rawhide_(textile) "Rawhide (textile)") and leather used in clothing.

Hunting is still vital in marginal climates, especially those unsuited for [pastoral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastoral "Pastoral") uses or for agriculture.[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-42) For example, [Inuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inuit "Inuit") in the [Arctic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic "Arctic") trap and hunt animals for clothing and use the skins of [sea mammals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_mammal "Marine mammal") to make [kayaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kayak "Kayak"), clothing, and footwear.

On ancient [reliefs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliefs "Reliefs"), especially from [Mesopotamia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesopotamia "Mesopotamia"), kings are often depicted by sculptors as hunters of [big game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_game_hunting "Big game hunting") such as lions and are often portrayed hunting from a [war chariot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_chariot "War chariot") - early examples of royalty symbolically and militaristically engaging in hunting[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-43) as "the sport of kings".[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-44) The cultural and [psychological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological "Psychological") importance of hunting in ancient societies is represented by deities such as [the horned god](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horned_God "Horned God")[Cernunnos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cernunnos "Cernunnos") and [lunar goddesses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_deity "Lunar deity") of [classical antiquity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_antiquity "Classical antiquity"), the Greek [Artemis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis "Artemis") or Roman [Diana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana_(mythology) "Diana (mythology)"). [Taboos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taboo "Taboo") are often related[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] to hunting, and mythological association of prey species with a [divinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divinity "Divinity") could be reflected in hunting restrictions such as a [reserve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_reserve "Nature reserve") surrounding a temple. [Euripides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euripides "Euripides")' tale of Artemis and [Actaeon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actaeon "Actaeon"), for example, may be seen as a caution against disrespect of prey or against impudent boasting.

With the domestication of the dog, [birds of prey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_of_prey "Bird of prey"), and the [ferret](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferret "Ferret"), various forms of animal-aided hunting developed, including [venery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_hunting "Medieval hunting") ([scent-hound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scent_hound "Scent hound") hunting, such as [fox hunting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_hunting "Fox hunting")), [coursing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coursing "Coursing") ([sight-hound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sight_hound "Sight hound") hunting), [falconry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falconry "Falconry"), and [ferreting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferreting "Ferreting"). While these are all associated[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] with [medieval hunting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_hunting "Medieval hunting"), over time, various [dog breeds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_breed "Dog breed") were selected by humans for very precise tasks during the hunt, reflected in such names as ["pointer"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointing_breed "Pointing breed") and "[setter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setter "Setter")".

### Pastoral and agricultural societies

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hunting&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Pastoral and agricultural societies")]

Even as agriculture and [animal husbandry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_husbandry "Animal husbandry") became more prevalent, hunting often remained as a part of human culture where the environment and social conditions allowed. Hunter-gatherer societies persisted, even when increasingly confined to marginal areas. And within agricultural systems, hunting served to kill animals that prey upon [domestic and wild animals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_domesticated_animals "List of domesticated animals") or to attempt to [extirpate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_extinction "Local extinction") animals seen by humans as competition for resources such as water or forage.

When hunting moved from a subsistence activity to a selective one, two trends emerged:

1.   the development of the role of the specialist hunter, with special training and equipment
2.   the option of hunting as a "sport" for members of an upper social class

The meaning of the word _game_ in [Middle English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_English "Middle English") evolved to include an animal which is hunted. As the domestication of animals for meat grew, subsistence hunting remained among the lowest classes; however, the stylised pursuit of game in European societies became a luxury. Dangerous hunting, such as for lions or [wild boars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_boar "Wild boar"), often done on [horseback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horseback "Horseback") or from a [chariot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chariot "Chariot"), had a function similar to [tournaments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tournament_(medieval) "Tournament (medieval)") and manly sports. Hunting ranked as an honourable, somewhat competitive pastime to help the [aristocracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristocracy "Aristocracy") practice skills of war in times of peace.[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-45)

In most parts of [medieval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval "Medieval") Europe, the upper class obtained the sole rights to hunt in certain areas of a feudal territory. Game in these areas was used as a source of food and furs, often provided via professional huntsmen, but it was also expected to provide a form of recreation for the aristocracy. The importance of this proprietary view of game can be seen in the [Robin Hood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Hood "Robin Hood") legends, in which one of the primary charges against the outlaws is that they "hunt the King's deer". In contrast, settlers in Anglophone colonies gloried democratically in hunting for all.[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-46)

In medieval Europe, hunting was considered by [Johannes Scotus Eriugena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Scotus_Eriugena "Johannes Scotus Eriugena") to be part of the set of _[seven mechanical arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanic\_arts "Mechanic arts")_.[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-47)

Although various other animals have been used to aid the hunter, such as [ferrets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrets "Ferrets"), the dog has assumed many very important uses to the hunter. The domestication of the dog has led to a [symbiotic relationship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbiosis "Symbiosis") in which the dog's independence from humans is deferred. Though dogs can survive independently of humans, and in many cases do ferally, when raised or adopted by humans the species tends to defer to its control in exchange for habitation, food and support.[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-48)

Dogs today are used to find, chase, retrieve, and sometimes kill game. Dogs allow humans to pursue and kill prey that would otherwise be very difficult or dangerous to hunt. Different breeds of specifically bred [hunting dog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting_dog "Hunting dog") are used for different types of hunting. Waterfowl are commonly hunted using retrieving dogs such as the [Labrador Retriever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labrador_Retriever "Labrador Retriever"), the [Golden Retriever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Retriever "Golden Retriever"), the [Chesapeake Bay Retriever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chesapeake_Bay_Retriever "Chesapeake Bay Retriever"), the [Brittany Spaniel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittany_Spaniel "Brittany Spaniel"), and other similar breeds. [Game birds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upland_game_bird "Upland game bird") are flushed out using flushing [spaniels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaniel "Spaniel") such as the [English Springer Spaniel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Springer_Spaniel "English Springer Spaniel"), the various [Cocker Spaniels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocker_Spaniel "Cocker Spaniel") and similar breeds.

The hunting of wild mammals in England and Wales with dogs was banned under the [Hunting Act 2004](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting_Act_2004 "Hunting Act 2004"). The wild mammals include fox, hare, deer and mink. There are, however, exceptions in the Act.[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-49) Nevertheless, there have been numerous attempts on behalf of activists, pressure groups, etc. to revoke the act over the last two decades.[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-50)[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-51)[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-52)

Many prehistoric deities are depicted as predators or prey of humans, often in a [zoomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoomorphic "Zoomorphic") form, perhaps alluding to the importance of hunting for most Palaeolithic cultures.

In many pagan religions, specific rituals are conducted before or after a hunt; the rituals done may vary according to the species hunted or the season the hunt is taking place.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] Often a hunting ground, or the hunt for one or more species, was reserved or prohibited in the context of a temple cult.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] In Roman religion, [Diana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana_(mythology) "Diana (mythology)") is the goddess of the hunt.[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-53)

[Hindu scriptures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_scripture "Hindu scripture") describe hunting as an occupation, as well as a sport of the kingly. Even figures considered divine are described to have engaged in hunting. One of the names of the god [Shiva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiva "Shiva") is Mrigavyadha (deer-slayer).[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-54) The word _Mriga_, in many Indian languages including Malayalam, not only stands for deer, but for all animals and animal instincts (Mriga Thrishna). Shiva, as Mrigavyadha, is the one who destroys the animal instincts in human beings. In the epic [Ramayana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramayana "Ramayana"), [Dasharatha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dasharatha "Dasharatha"), the father of [Rama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rama "Rama"), is said to have the ability to hunt in the dark. During one of his hunting expeditions, he accidentally killed [Shravana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shravana "Shravana"), mistaking him for game. During Rama's exile in the forest, [Ravana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravana "Ravana") kidnapped his wife, [Sita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sita "Sita"), from their hut, while Rama was asked by Sita to capture a golden deer, and his brother [Lakshman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakshman "Lakshman") went after him. According to the [Mahabharat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahabharat "Mahabharat"), [Pandu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandu "Pandu"), the father of the [Pandavas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandavas "Pandavas"), accidentally killed the sage Kindama and his wife with an arrow, mistaking them for a deer.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

[Jainism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jainism "Jainism") teaches followers to have tremendous respect for all of life. Prohibitions for hunting and meat eating are the fundamental conditions for being a [Jain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jain "Jain").[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-55)

[Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism "Buddhism")'s first [precept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precept "Precept") is the respect for all sentient life. The general approach by all Buddhists is to avoid killing any living animals. [Buddha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gautama_Buddha "Gautama Buddha") explained the issue by saying "all fear death; comparing others with oneself, one should neither kill nor cause to kill."[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-56)

In [Sikhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikhism "Sikhism"), only meat obtained from hunting, or slaughtered with the [Jhatka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jhatka "Jhatka") is permitted. The [Sikh gurus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikh_gurus "Sikh gurus"), especially [Guru Hargobind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guru_Hargobind "Guru Hargobind") and [Guru Gobind Singh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guru_Gobind_Singh "Guru Gobind Singh") were ardent hunters. Many old Sikh [Rehatnamas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikh_Rehat_Maryada "Sikh Rehat Maryada") like [Prem Sumarag](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Prem_Sumarag&action=edit&redlink=1 "Prem Sumarag (page does not exist)"), recommend hunting [wild boar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_boar "Wild boar") and [deer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deer "Deer"). However, among modern Sikhs, the practice of hunting has died down; some even saying that all meat is forbidden.

[Tapestry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tapestry "Tapestry") with a hunting scene, late 16th century

From [early Christian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Christian "Early Christian") times, hunting has been forbidden to Roman Catholic Church [clerics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleric "Cleric"). Thus the _[Corpus Juris Canonici](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus\_Juris\_Canonici "Corpus Juris Canonici")_ (C. ii, X, De cleric. venat.) says, "We forbid to all servants of God hunting and expeditions through the woods with hounds; and we also forbid them to keep hawks or falcons." The [Fourth Council of the Lateran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Council_of_the_Lateran "Fourth Council of the Lateran"), held under [Pope Innocent III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Innocent_III "Pope Innocent III"), decreed (canon xv): "We interdict hunting or hawking to all clerics." The decree of the [Council of Trent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Trent "Council of Trent") is worded more mildly: "Let clerics abstain from illicit hunting and hawking" (Sess. XXIV, De reform., c. xii), which seems to imply that not all hunting is illicit, and canonists generally make a distinction declaring noisy (_clamorosa_) hunting unlawful, but not quiet (_quieta_) hunting.[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-:3-57)

Ferraris gives it as the general sense of canonists that hunting is allowed to clerics if it be indulged in rarely and for sufficient cause, as necessity, utility or "honest" recreation, and with that moderation which is becoming to the ecclesiastical state. Ziegler, however, thinks that the interpretation of the canonists is not in accordance with the letter or spirit of the laws of the church.[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-:3-57)

Nevertheless, although a distinction between lawful and unlawful hunting[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-58) is undoubtedly permissible, it is certain that a bishop can absolutely prohibit all hunting to the clerics of his diocese, as was done by [synods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synod "Synod") at [Milan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milan "Milan"), [Avignon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avignon "Avignon"), [Liège](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li%C3%A8ge "Liège"), [Cologne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cologne "Cologne"), and elsewhere. [Benedict XIV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benedict_XIV "Benedict XIV") declared that such synodal decrees are not too severe, as an absolute prohibition of hunting is more conformable to the [ecclesiastical law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_law "Canon law"). In practice, therefore, the synodal statutes of various localities must be consulted to discover whether they allow quiet hunting or prohibit it altogether.[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-:3-57) Small-scale hunting as a family or [subsistence farming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsistence_farming "Subsistence farming") activity is recognised by [Pope Francis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Francis "Pope Francis") in his encyclical letter, [Laudato si'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laudato_si%27 "Laudato si'"), as a legitimate and valuable aspect of employment within the food production system.[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-59)

Hunting is not forbidden in [Jewish law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_law "Jewish law"), although there is an aversion to it. The great 18th-century authority [Rabbi Yechezkel Landau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbi_Yechezkel_Landau "Rabbi Yechezkel Landau") after a study concluded although "hunting would not be considered cruelty to animals insofar as the animal is generally killed quickly and not tortured... There is an unseemly element in it, namely cruelty." The other issue is that hunting can be dangerous and Judaism places an extreme emphasis on the value of human life.[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-60)[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-61)

Islamic [Sharia Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharia "Sharia") permits hunting of lawful animals and birds if they cannot be easily caught and slaughtered. However, this is only for the purpose of food and not for trophy hunting.[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-62)

Nowadays, it is often used to describe hunting tours through African wildlife.[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-66)

Hunters are usually tourists, accompanied by [licensed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting_license "Hunting license") and highly [regulated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation "Regulation") professional hunters, local guides, [skinners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skinner_(profession) "Skinner (profession)"), and [porters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porter_(carrier) "Porter (carrier)") in more difficult terrains.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] A special safari type is the solo-safari, where all the license acquiring, stalking, preparation, and outfitting is done by the hunter himself.[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-67)

A _Shikar_ party in [Mandalay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandalay "Mandalay"), [Burma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burma "Burma"), soon after the conclusion of the [Third Anglo-Burmese War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Anglo-Burmese_War "Third Anglo-Burmese War") in 1886, when Burma was annexed to [British India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_India "British India")

During the [feudal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_feudalism "Indian feudalism") and [colonial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonial_India "Colonial India") times in [British India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Raj "British Raj"), hunting or _shikar_ was regarded as a regal sport in the numerous [princely states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princely_states "Princely states"), as many [maharajas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maharaja "Maharaja") and [nawabs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nawab "Nawab"), as well as British officers, maintained a whole corps of _shikari_ s ([big-game hunters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big-game_hunting "Big-game hunting")), who were native professional hunters. They would be headed by a master of the hunt, who might be styled _mir-shikar_. Often, they recruited the normally low-ranking local tribes because of their [traditional knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_knowledge "Traditional knowledge") of the environment and hunting techniques. Big game, such as [Bengal tigers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal_tigers "Bengal tigers"), might be hunted from the back of an [Indian elephant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_elephant "Indian elephant").

Regional [social norms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(sociology) "Norm (sociology)") are generally antagonistic to hunting, while a few [sects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sect "Sect"), such as the [Bishnoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishnoi "Bishnoi"), lay special emphasis on the conservation of particular species, such as the [antelope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antelope "Antelope"). India's [Wildlife Protection Act of 1972](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife_Protection_Act_of_1972 "Wildlife Protection Act of 1972") bans the killing of all wild animals. However, the [Chief Wildlife Warden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Forest_Service "Indian Forest Service") may, if satisfied that any wild animal from a specified list has become dangerous to human life or is so disabled or diseased as to be beyond recovery, permit any person to hunt such an animal. In this case, the body of any wild animal killed or wounded becomes government property.[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-68)

The practice among the soldiers in British India during the 1770s of going out to hunt [snipes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snipe "Snipe"), a [shorebird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shorebird "Shorebird") considered extremely challenging for hunters due to its alertness, camouflaging colour and erratic flight behavior, is believed to be the origin of the modern word for [sniper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sniper "Sniper"), as snipe-hunters needed to be stealthy in addition to having [tracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracking_(hunting) "Tracking (hunting)") skills and [marksmanship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marksmanship "Marksmanship").[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-:10-69)[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-etymology-70) The term was used in the nineteenth century, and had become common usage by the [First World War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World_War "First World War").

Unarmed [fox hunting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_hunting "Fox hunting") on horseback with hounds is the type of hunting most closely associated with the United Kingdom; in fact, "hunting" without qualification implies fox hunting.[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-72) What in other countries is called "hunting" is called "shooting" (birds)[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-73) or "stalking" (deer)[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-:6-74) in Britain. Fox hunting is a social activity for the upper classes, with roles strictly defined by wealth and status.[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-75)[[76]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-76) Similar to fox hunting in many ways is the chasing of hares with [hounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hound "Hound"). Pairs of [sighthounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sighthound "Sighthound") (or long-dogs), such as [greyhounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greyhound "Greyhound"), may be used to pursue a hare in coursing, where the greyhounds are marked as to their skill in coursing the hare (but are not intended to actually catch it), or the hare may be pursued with [scent hounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scent_hound "Scent hound") such as [beagles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beagle "Beagle") or harriers. Other sorts of [foxhounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxhound "Foxhound") may also be used for hunting [stags (deer)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stag "Stag") or [mink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_mink "American mink").[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_][Deer stalking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deer_stalking "Deer stalking") with rifles is carried out on foot without hounds, using stealth.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-:4-11)

These forms of hunting have been controversial in the UK. [Animal welfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_welfare "Animal welfare") supporters believe that hunting causes unnecessary suffering to foxes, horses, and hounds. Proponents argue that the activity is a historical tradition. Using dogs to chase wild mammals was [made illegal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_hunting_legislation "Fox hunting legislation") in February 2005 by the [Hunting Act 2004](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting_Act_2004 "Hunting Act 2004"); there were a number of exemptions (under which the activity may not be illegal) in the act for hunting with hounds, but no exemptions at all for hare-coursing.[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-:6-74)

#### Shooting traditions

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hunting&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Shooting traditions")]

Game birds, especially [pheasants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pheasant "Pheasant"), are shot with shotguns for sport in the UK; the [British Association for Shooting and Conservation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Association_for_Shooting_and_Conservation "British Association for Shooting and Conservation") says that over a million people per year participate in shooting, including game shooting, [clay pigeon shooting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_pigeon_shooting "Clay pigeon shooting"), and [target shooting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_sports "Shooting sports").[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-77) Shooting as practiced in Britain, as opposed to traditional hunting, requires little questing for game—around thirty-five million birds are released onto shooting estates every year, some having been [factory farmed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_farming "Factory farming"). Shoots can be elaborate affairs with guns placed in assigned positions and assistants to help load shotguns. When in position, "[beaters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beater_(hunting) "Beater (hunting)")" move through the areas of cover, swinging sticks or flags to drive the game out. Such events are often called "drives" /[driven hunting](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Driven_hunting&action=edit&redlink=1 "Driven hunting (page does not exist)"). The open season for [grouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grouse "Grouse") in the UK begins on 12 August, the so-called [Glorious Twelfth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glorious_Twelfth "Glorious Twelfth"). The definition of game in the United Kingdom is governed by the [Game Act 1831](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Act_1831 "Game Act 1831") ([1 & 2 Will. 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_%26_2_Will._4 "1 & 2 Will. 4"). c. 32).

A similar tradition, _[ojeo](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ojeo&action=edit&redlink=1 "Ojeo (page does not exist)")[[es](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/ojeo "es:ojeo")]_, exists in Spain.

North American hunting pre-dates the United States by thousands of years and was an important part of many [pre-Columbian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-Columbian "Pre-Columbian") Native American cultures. Native Americans retain some hunting rights and are exempt from some laws as part of Indian treaties and otherwise under [federal law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_law "Federal law")[[78]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-78)—examples include [eagle feather laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle_feather_law "Eagle feather law") and exemptions in the [Marine Mammal Protection Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Mammal_Protection_Act_of_1972 "Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972"). This is considered particularly important in [Alaskan native](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Native "Alaska Native") communities.

Gun usage in hunting is typically regulated by game category, area within the state, and time period. Regulations for [big-game hunting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big-game_hunting "Big-game hunting") often specify a minimum [caliber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caliber "Caliber") or [muzzle energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muzzle_energy "Muzzle energy") for [firearms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm "Firearm"). The use of [rifles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifle "Rifle") is often banned for safety reasons in areas with high [population densities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_density "Population density") or limited [topographic relief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrain "Terrain"). Regulations may also limit or ban the use of [lead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead "Lead") in [ammunition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammunition "Ammunition") because of environmental concerns. Specific seasons for [bow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bow_(weapon) "Bow (weapon)") hunting or [muzzle-loading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muzzle-loader "Muzzle-loader")[black-powder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_powder "Black powder") guns are often established to limit competition with hunters using more effective [weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapons "Weapons").

Hunting in the United States is not associated with any particular class or culture; a 2006 poll showed seventy-eight per cent of Americans supported legal hunting,[[79]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-79) although relatively few Americans actually hunt. At the beginning of the 21st century, just six per cent of Americans hunted. [Southerners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States "Southern United States") in states along the eastern seaboard hunted at a rate of five per cent, slightly below the national average, and while hunting was more common in other parts of the South at nine per cent, these rates did not surpass those of the Plains states, where twelve per cent of [Midwesterners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwesterners "Midwesterners") hunted. Hunting in other areas of the country fell below the national average.[[80]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-80) Overall, in the 1996–2006 period, the number of hunters over the age of sixteen declined by ten per cent, a drop attributable to a number of factors including [habitat loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_destruction "Habitat destruction") and changes in recreation habits.[[81]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-81)

The principles of the [fair chase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_chase "Fair chase")[[82]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-82) have been a part of the American hunting tradition for over one hundred years. The role of the hunter-conservationist, popularised by Theodore Roosevelt, and perpetuated by Roosevelt's formation of the [Boone and Crockett Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boone_and_Crockett_Club "Boone and Crockett Club"), has been central to the development of the modern fair chase tradition. _Beyond Fair Chase: The Ethic and Tradition of Hunting_, a book by Jim Posewitz, describes fair chase:

> "Fundamental to ethical hunting is the idea of fair chase. This concept addresses the balance between the hunter and the hunted. It is a balance that allows hunters to occasionally succeed while animals generally avoid being taken."[[83]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-83)

When [Internet hunting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_hunting "Internet hunting") was introduced in 2005, allowing people to hunt over the Internet using remotely controlled guns, the practice was widely criticised by hunters as violating the principles of fair chase. As a representative of the [National Rifle Association of America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Rifle_Association_of_America "National Rifle Association of America") (NRA) explained, "The NRA has always maintained that fair chase, being in the field with your firearm or bow, is an important element of hunting tradition. Sitting at your desk in front of your computer, clicking at a mouse, has nothing to do with hunting."[[84]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-HSUS-FactSheet-84)

Animals such as [blackbuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackbuck "Blackbuck"), [nilgai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nilgai "Nilgai"), [axis deer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_deer "Axis deer"), [fallow deer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallow_deer "Fallow deer"), [zebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zebra "Zebra"), [barasingha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barasingha "Barasingha"), [gazelle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gazelle "Gazelle") and many other exotic game species can now be found on [game farms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_farm "Game farm") and [ranches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranch "Ranch") in [Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas "Texas"), where they were introduced for sport hunting. These hunters can be found paying in excess of $10,000 to take trophy animals on these controlled ranches.[[85]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-85)

The [Russian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia "Russia") imperial hunts evolved from hunting traditions of early Russian rulers—[Grand Princes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Prince "Grand Prince") and [Tsars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Czar "Russian Czar")—under the influence of hunting customs of European royal courts. The imperial hunts were organised mainly in [Peterhof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petergof "Petergof"), [Tsarskoye Selo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsarskoye_Selo "Tsarskoye Selo"), and [Gatchina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gatchina "Gatchina").

Hunting in [Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia "Australia") has evolved around the hunting and eradication of various animals considered to be pests or [invasive species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species "Invasive species") . All native animals are protected by law, and certain species such as [kangaroos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangaroo "Kangaroo") and [ducks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck "Duck") can be hunted by [licensed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting_license "Hunting license") shooters but only under a special permit on [public lands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_land "Public land") during [open seasons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting_season "Hunting season"). The [introduced species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduced_species "Introduced species") that are targeted include [European rabbits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_rabbit "European rabbit"), [red foxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_fox "Red fox"), [deer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deer "Deer") ([sambar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sambar_deer "Sambar deer"), [hog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_hog_deer "Indian hog deer"), [red](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_deer "Red deer"), [fallow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_fallow_deer "European fallow deer"), [chital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chital "Chital") and [rusa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javan_rusa "Javan rusa")), [feral cats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feral_cats_in_Australia "Feral cats in Australia"), [pigs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feral_pig#Australia "Feral pig"), [goats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feral_goats_in_Australia "Feral goats in Australia"), [brumbies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brumby "Brumby"), [donkeys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feral_donkeys_in_Australia "Feral donkeys in Australia") and occasionally [camels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_feral_camel "Australian feral camel"), as well as introduced [upland birds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upland_bird "Upland bird") such as [quails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quail "Quail"), [pheasants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pheasant "Pheasant") and [partridges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partridge "Partridge").

New Zealand has a strong hunting culture.[[86]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-86) When humans arrived, the only mammals present on the islands making up New Zealand were bats, although seals and other marine mammals were present along the coasts. However, when humans arrived they brought other species with them. Polynesian voyagers introduced kuri (dogs), kiore (Polynesian rats), as well as a range of plant species. European explorers further added to New Zealand's biota, particularly pigs which were introduced by either Captain Cook or the French explorer De Surville in the 1700s.[[87]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-87)[[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-88) During the nineteenth century, as European colonisation took place, [acclimatisation societies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acclimatisation_society "Acclimatisation society") were established. The societies introduced a large number of species with no use other than as prey for hunting.[[89]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-89) Species that adapted well to the New Zealand terrain include [deer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deer "Deer"), [pigs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigs "Pigs"), [goats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goats "Goats"), [hare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hare "Hare"), [tahr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tahr "Tahr") and [chamois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamois "Chamois"). With wilderness areas, suitable forage, and no natural predators, their populations exploded. Government agencies view the animals as pests due to their effects on the [natural environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment "Natural environment") and on agricultural production, but hunters view them as a resource.

Iranian tradition regarded hunting as an essential part of a prince's education,[[90]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-90) and hunting was well recorded for the education of the upper-class youths during [pre-Islamic Persia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Iran#Classical_antiquity "History of Iran"). As of October 2020, a hunting licensee costs $20,000. The Department of Environment although do not report the number of permits issued.[[91]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-91)

The numbers of licensed hunters in [Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan "Japan"), including those using [snares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snare_trap "Snare trap") and guns, is generally decreasing, while their average age is increasing. As of 2010, there were approximately 190,000 registered hunters, approximately 65% of whom were sixty years old or older.[[92]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-92)

### Trinidad and Tobago

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hunting&action=edit&section=23 "Edit section: Trinidad and Tobago")]

There is a very active tradition of hunting small to medium-sized wild game in [Trinidad and Tobago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinidad_and_Tobago "Trinidad and Tobago"). Hunting is carried out with firearms, slingshots and cage traps, and sometimes aided by the use of hounds. The illegal use of trap guns and snare nets also occurs. With approximately 12,000 to 13,000 hunters applying for and being granted hunting permits in recent years, there is some concern that the practice might not be sustainable. In addition, there are at present no bag limits and the open season is comparatively very long (5 months – October to February inclusive). As such hunting pressure from legal hunters is very high. Added to that, there is a thriving and very lucrative black market for poached wild game (sold and enthusiastically purchased as expensive luxury delicacies) and the numbers of commercial poachers in operation is unknown but presumed to be fairly high. As a result, the populations of the five major mammalian game species ([red-rumped agouti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-rumped_agouti "Red-rumped agouti"), [lowland paca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowland_paca "Lowland paca"), [nine-banded armadillo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine-banded_armadillo "Nine-banded armadillo"), [collared peccary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collared_peccary "Collared peccary") and [red brocket deer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_brocket_deer "Red brocket deer")) are thought to be relatively low when compared to less-hunted regions in nearby mainland [South America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America "South America") (although scientifically conducted population studies are only just recently being conducted as of 2013). It appears that the [red brocket deer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_brocket_deer "Red brocket deer") population has been extirpated in [Tobago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobago "Tobago") as a result of over-hunting. By some time in the mid 20th century another extirpation due to over-hunting occurred in [Trinidad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinidad "Trinidad") with its population of [horned screamer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horned_screamer "Horned screamer") (a large game bird). Various herons, ducks, doves, the [green iguana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_iguana "Green iguana"), the [cryptic golden tegu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptic_golden_tegu "Cryptic golden tegu"), the [spectacled caiman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectacled_caiman "Spectacled caiman"), the [common opossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_opossum "Common opossum") and the [capybara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara "Capybara") are also commonly hunted and poached. There is also some poaching of 'fully protected species', including [red howler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guyanan_red_howler "Guyanan red howler") monkey and [capuchin monkeys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capuchin_monkey "Capuchin monkey"), [southern tamandua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_tamandua "Southern tamandua"), [Brazilian porcupine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_porcupine "Brazilian porcupine"), [yellow-footed tortoise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow-footed_tortoise "Yellow-footed tortoise"), the critically endangered island endemic [Trinidad piping guan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinidad_piping_guan "Trinidad piping guan") and even one of the national birds, the [scarlet ibis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarlet_ibis "Scarlet ibis"). Legal hunters pay relatively small fees to obtain hunting licenses and undergo no official basic [conservation biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_biology "Conservation biology") or hunting-ethics/[fair chase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_chase "Fair chase") training and are not assessed regarding their knowledge and comprehension of the local wildlife conservation laws. There is presumed to be relatively little subsistence hunting in the country (with most hunting for either sport or commercial profit). The local wildlife management authorities are under-staffed and under-funded, and as such little in the way of enforcement is done to uphold existing wildlife management laws, with hunting/poaching occurring both in and out of season and even in wildlife sanctuaries. There is some indication that the government is beginning to take the issue of wildlife management more seriously, with well drafted legislation being brought before Parliament in 2015. It remains to be seen if the drafted legislation will be fully adopted and financially supported by the current and future governments, and if the general populace will move towards a greater awareness of the importance of wildlife conservation and change the culture of wanton consumption to one of sustainable management.

Wildlife management
-------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hunting&action=edit&section=24 "Edit section: Wildlife management")]

[![Image 31](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Weisergatter.png/250px-Weisergatter.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Weisergatter.png)

Control fence to assess the impact of [browsing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browsing_(herbivory) "Browsing (herbivory)") by [ungulates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ungulate "Ungulate"). Note the lack of natural forest regeneration outside the fencing.

Hunting is claimed to give [resource managers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife_management "Wildlife management") an important tool[[93]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-93)[[94]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-94) in managing populations that might exceed the [carrying capacity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrying_capacity "Carrying capacity") of their [habitat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat "Habitat") and threaten the well-being of other species, or, in some instances, damage human health or safety.[[95]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-95)

In some cases, hunting actually can increase the population of predators such as coyotes by removing territorial bounds that would otherwise be established, resulting in excess neighbouring migrations into an area, thus artificially increasing the population.[[96]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-96) Hunting advocates[_[who?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual\_of\_Style/Words\_to\_watch#Unsupported\_attributions "Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch")_] assert that hunting reduces [intraspecific competition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraspecific_competition "Intraspecific competition") for food and shelter, reducing mortality among the remaining animals. Some [environmentalists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmentalist "Environmentalist") assert[_[who?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual\_of\_Style/Words\_to\_watch#Unsupported\_attributions "Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch")_] that (re)introducing [predators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predator "Predator") would achieve the same end with greater efficiency and less negative effect, such as introducing significant amounts of free [lead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead "Lead") into the environment and [food chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_chain "Food chain").

In the United States, wildlife managers are frequently part of hunting regulatory and licensing bodies, where they help to set rules on the number, manner and conditions in which game may be hunted.

Management agencies sometimes rely on hunting to control specific animal populations, as has been the case with deer in North America. These hunts may sometimes be carried out by professional shooters, although others may include amateur hunters. Many US city and local governments hire professional and amateur hunters each year to reduce populations of animals such as deer that are becoming hazardous in a restricted area, such as neighbourhood parks and [metropolitan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_area "Metropolitan area") open spaces.

A large part of managing populations involves managing the number and, sometimes, the size or age of animals harvested so as to ensure the sustainability of the population. Tools that are frequently used to control harvest are bag limits and season closures, although gear restrictions such as archery-only seasons are becoming increasingly popular in an effort to reduce hunter success rates in countries that rely on bag limits per hunter instead of per area.[[97]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-PLOSONE2021-97)[[98]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-MDWFP-98)[[99]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-HunterEd-99)[[100]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-OutdoorZia-100)

Illegal hunting and harvesting of wild species contrary to local and international [conservation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_(ethic) "Conservation (ethic)") and wildlife management laws is called poaching. [Game preservation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_preservation "Game preservation") is one of the tactics used to prevent poaching. Violations of hunting laws and regulations involving poaching are normally punishable by law.[[101]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-101) Punishment can include [confiscation of equipment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confiscation "Confiscation"), [fines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine_(penalty) "Fine (penalty)") or a [prison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison "Prison") sentence.

The right to hunt—sometimes in combination with the right to fish—is protected implicitly, as a consequence of the [right of ownership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_rights_(economics) "Property rights (economics)"),[[102]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-102) or explicitly, as a [right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rights "Rights") on its own,[[103]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-103)[[104]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-:0-104) in a number of jurisdictions. For instance, as of 2019, a total of 22 U.S. states explicitly recognize a subjective right to hunt in their constitutions.[[104]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-:0-104)[[105]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-105)

[![Image 32](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Bird_shooting_game_rack.jpg/250px-Bird_shooting_game_rack.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bird_shooting_game_rack.jpg)

Bag limits are provisions under the law that control how many animals of a given species or group of species can be killed, although there are often species for which bag limits do not apply. There are also [jurisdictions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction "Jurisdiction") where bag limits are not applied at all or are not applied under certain circumstances. The phrase _bag limits_ come from the custom among hunters of small game to carry successful kills in a small basket, similar to a [fishing creel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing_creel "Fishing creel").

Where bag limits are used, there can be daily or seasonal bag limits; for example, ducks can often be harvested at a rate of six per hunter per day.[[106]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-106) Big game, like [moose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moose "Moose"), most often have a seasonal bag limit of one animal per hunter.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] Bag limits may also regulate the size, sex, or age of animal that a hunter can kill. In many cases, bag limits are designed to allocate harvest among the hunting population more equitably rather than to protect animal populations, as protecting the population would necessitate regional density-dependent maximum bags.

### Closed and open season

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hunting&action=edit&section=28 "Edit section: Closed and open season")]

A [closed season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_season "Closed season") is a time during which hunting an animal of a given species is contrary to law. Typically, closed seasons are designed to protect a species when they are most vulnerable or to protect them during their [breeding season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breeding_season "Breeding season").[[107]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-107) By extension, the period that is not the closed season is known as the [open season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_season_(hunting) "Open season (hunting)").

Historical, subsistence, and sport hunting techniques can differ radically, with modern hunting regulations often addressing issues of where, when, and how hunts are conducted. Techniques may vary depending on government regulations, a hunter's personal ethics, local custom, hunting equipment, and the animal being hunted. Often a hunter will use a combination of more than one technique. Laws may forbid sport hunters from using some methods used primarily in poaching and wildlife management.

Trophy hunting is the selective seeking and killing of wild game animals to take [trophies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trophies "Trophies") for [personal collection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_collection "Private collection"), [bragging rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boasting "Boasting") or as a [status symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_symbol "Status symbol"). It may also include the controversial hunting of captive or semi-captive animals expressly bred and raised under controlled or semi-controlled conditions so as to attain trophy characteristics; this is sometimes known as [canned hunts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canned_hunt "Canned hunt").[[118]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-118)

In the 19th century, southern and central European sport hunters often pursued game only for a [trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trophy "Trophy"), usually the head or [pelt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fur "Fur") of an animal, which was then displayed as a sign of prowess. The rest of the animal was typically discarded. Some cultures, however, disapprove of such waste. In [Nordic countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordic_countries "Nordic countries"), hunting for trophies was—and still is—frowned upon. Hunting in North America in the 19th century was done primarily as a way to supplement food supplies, although it is now undertaken mainly for sport.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] The [safari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#East_Africa) method of hunting was a development of sport hunting that saw elaborate travel in Africa, India and other places in pursuit of trophies. In modern times, [trophy hunting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trophy_hunting "Trophy hunting") persists and is a significant industry in some areas.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

According to the [U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Fish_and_Wildlife_Service "U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service"), hunting "provides an economic incentive" for ranchers to continue to breed those species, and that hunting "reduces the threat of the species' extinction."[[119]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-119)[[120]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-120)

A scientific study in the journal, _Biological Conservation_, states that trophy hunting is of "major importance to conservation in Africa by creating economic incentives for conservation over vast areas, including areas which may be unsuitable for alternative wildlife-based land uses such as photographic ecotourism."[[121]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-africanwildlifeconservationfund.org-121) However, another study states that less than 3% of a trophy hunters' expenditures reach the local level, meaning that the economic incentive and benefit is "minimal, particularly when we consider the vast areas of land that hunting concessions occupy."[[122]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-economistsatlarge-122)

Financial incentives from trophy hunting effectively more than double the land area that is used for wildlife conservation, relative to what would be conserved relying on national parks alone according to _Biological Conservation_,[[121]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-africanwildlifeconservationfund.org-121) although local communities usually derive no more than 18 cents per hectare from trophy hunting.[[122]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-economistsatlarge-122)

[Trophy hunting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trophy_hunting "Trophy hunting") has been considered essential for providing economic incentives to conserve large carnivores according to research studies in _Conservation Biology_,[[123]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-cbs.umn.edu-123)_Journal of Sustainable Tourism_,[[124]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-124)_Wildlife Conservation by Sustainable Use_,[[125]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-125) and _Animal Conservation_.[[123]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-cbs.umn.edu-123)[[126]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-126) Studies by the Centre for Responsible Tourism[[127]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-127) and the IUCN state that ecotourism, which includes more than hunting, is a superior economic incentive, generating twice the revenue per acre and 39 times more permanent employment.[[128]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-128) At the cross-section of trophy hunting, ecotourism and conservation is [green hunting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_hunting "Green hunting"), a trophy hunting alternative where hunters pay to dart animals that need to be tranquilized for conservation projects.[[129]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-129)

The [U.S. House Committee on Natural Resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._House_Committee_on_Natural_Resources "U.S. House Committee on Natural Resources") in 2016 concluded that trophy hunting may be contributing to the extinction of certain animals.[[130]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-130) Animal welfare organizations, including the [International Fund for Animal Welfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IFAW "IFAW"), claim that trophy hunting is a key factor in the "silent extinction" of [giraffes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giraffes "Giraffes").[[131]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-131)

According to a national survey that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service conducts every five years, fewer people are hunting, even as population rises. National Public Radio reported, a graph shows 2016 statistics, that only about 5 per cent of Americans, 16 years old and older, actually hunt, which is half of what it was 50 years ago. The decline in popularity of hunting is expected to accelerate over the next decade, which threatens how US will pay for conservation. [[132]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-132)

Trophy hunting is most often criticised when it involves rare or [endangered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered "Endangered") animals.[[133]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-133) Opponents may also see trophy hunting as an issue of [morality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morality "Morality")[[134]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-134) or [animal cruelty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruelty_to_animals "Cruelty to animals"), criticising the killing of living creatures for [recreation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreation "Recreation"). [Victorian era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_era "Victorian era") dramatist [W. S. Gilbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._S._Gilbert "W. S. Gilbert") remarked, "[Deer-stalking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deer-stalking "Deer-stalking") would be a very fine sport if only the deer had guns."[[135]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-135)

There is also debate about the extent to which trophy hunting benefits the [local economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_economy "Local economy"). Hunters pay substantial fees to the game outfitters and hunting guides which contributes to the local economy and provides value to animals that would otherwise be seen as competition for grazing, livestock, and crops.[[136]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-136) However, the argument is disputed by animal welfare organizations and other opponents of trophy hunting.[[137]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-137)[[138]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-138) It is argued that the animals are worth more to the community for [ecotourism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecotourism "Ecotourism") than hunting.[[139]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-139)[[140]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-140)

A variety of industries benefit from hunting and support hunting on economic grounds. In [Tanzania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanzania "Tanzania"), it is estimated that a safari hunter spends fifty to one hundred times that of the average [ecotourist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecotourist "Ecotourist"). While the average photo tourist may seek luxury accommodation, the average safari hunter generally stays in tented camps. Safari hunters are also more likely to use remote areas, uninviting to the typical ecotourist. Advocates argue that these hunters allow for anti-poaching activities and revenue for local communities.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

In the United Kingdom, the game hunting of birds as an industry is said to be extremely important to the rural economy. The Cobham Report of 1997 suggested it to be worth around £700 million, and hunting and shooting lobby groups claimed it to be worth over a billion pounds less than ten years later.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

Hunting also has a significant financial impact in the United States, with many companies specialising in hunting [equipment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_equipment "Sports equipment") or speciality tourism. Many different technologies have been created to assist hunters. Today's hunters come from a broad range of economic, social, and cultural backgrounds. In 2001, over thirteen million hunters averaged eighteen days hunting, and spent over $20.5 billion on their sport.[[141]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-141) In the US, proceeds from hunting licenses contribute to state game management programs, including preservation of wildlife habitat.

Hunting contributes to a portion of caloric intake of people and may have positive impacts on greenhouse gas emissions by avoidance of utilization of meat raised under industrial methods.[[142]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-142)

Lead bullets that miss their target or remain in an unretrieved carcass could become a [toxicant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicant "Toxicant") in the environment but lead in ammunition because of its metallic form has a lower solubility and higher resistance to corrosion than other forms of lead making it hardly available to biological systems.[[143]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-143) Waterfowl or other birds may ingest the lead and poison themselves with the neurotoxicant, but studies have demonstrated that effects of lead in ammunition are negligible on animal population size and growth.[[144]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-144)[[145]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-145) Since 1991, US federal law forbids lead shot in waterfowl hunts, and 30 states have some type of restriction.[[146]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-ps1013-146)

In December 2014, a federal appeals court denied a lawsuit by environmental groups that the [EPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPA "EPA") must use the [Toxic Substances Control Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxic_Substances_Control_Act "Toxic Substances Control Act") to regulate lead in shells and cartridges. The groups sought EPA to regulate "spent lead", yet the court found EPA could not regulate spent lead without also regulating cartridges and shells.[[147]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-we1214-147)

The changing distribution of the world's land mammals in tonnes of carbon. The [biomass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomass_(ecology) "Biomass (ecology)") of wild land mammals has declined by 85% since the emergence of humans, with hunting and agriculture being primary drivers of this decline.[[148]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-148)

Hunters have been driving forces throughout history in the movement to ensure the preservation of [wildlife habitats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_(ecology) "Habitat (ecology)") and [wildlife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife "Wildlife") for further hunting.[[149]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-149) However, excessive hunting and poachers have also contributed heavily to the endangerment, extirpation and extinction of many animals, such as the [quagga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quagga "Quagga"), the [great auk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_auk "Great auk"), [Steller's sea cow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steller%27s_sea_cow "Steller's sea cow"), the [thylacine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thylacine "Thylacine"), the [bluebuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluebuck "Bluebuck"), the [Arabian oryx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabian_oryx "Arabian oryx"), the [Caspian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspian_tiger "Caspian tiger") and [Javan tigers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javan_tiger "Javan tiger"), the [markhor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markhor "Markhor"), the [Sumatran rhinoceros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumatran_rhinoceros "Sumatran rhinoceros"), the bison, the [North American cougar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_cougar "North American cougar"), the [Altai argali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altai_argali "Altai argali") sheep, the [Asian elephant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_elephant "Asian elephant") and many more, primarily for commercial sale or sport. All these animals have been hunted to [endangerment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_species "Endangered species") or extinction.[[161]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-161) Poaching currently threatens bird and mammalian populations around the world.[[162]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-162)[[163]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-163)[[164]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-164) The 2019 _[Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global\_Assessment\_Report\_on\_Biodiversity\_and\_Ecosystem\_Services "Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services")_ lists the direct exploitation of organisms, including hunting, as the second leading cause of [biodiversity loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity_loss "Biodiversity loss"), after land use for [agriculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture "Agriculture").[[165]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-165) In 2022, [IPBES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPBES "IPBES") released another report which stated that unsustainable hunting, along with unsustainable logging and fishing, are primary drivers of the global extinction crisis.[[166]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-166) A 2023 study published in _[BioScience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BioScience "BioScience")_ posited that the prioritizing of hunting by state agencies in the United States over the rewinding of key species is "reinforcing" the loss of biodiversity.[[167]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-167)

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hunting&action=edit&section=41 "Edit section: Pittman–Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act of 1937")]

In 1937, American hunters successfully lobbied the US Congress to pass the [Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittman%E2%80%93Robertson_Federal_Aid_in_Wildlife_Restoration_Act "Pittman–Robertson Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act"), which placed an eleven per cent tax on all hunting equipment. This self-imposed tax now generates over $700 million each year and is used exclusively to establish, restore and protect wildlife habitats.[[168]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-168) The act is named for Nevada Senator [Key Pittman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_Pittman "Key Pittman") and Virginia Congressman [Absalom Willis Robertson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absalom_Willis_Robertson "Absalom Willis Robertson").

#### Federal Duck Stamp program

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hunting&action=edit&section=42 "Edit section: Federal Duck Stamp program")]

On 16 March 1934, [President Franklin D. Roosevelt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt "Franklin D. Roosevelt") signed the Migratory Bird Hunting Stamp Act, which requires an annual stamp purchase by all hunters over the age of sixteen. The stamps are created on behalf of the program by the [US Postal Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Postal_Service "US Postal Service") and depict wildlife artwork chosen through an annual contest. They play an important role in [habitat conservation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_conservation "Habitat conservation") because ninety-eight per cent of all funds generated by their sale go directly toward the purchase or lease of [wetland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wetland "Wetland") habitat for protection in the [National Wildlife Refuge System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Wildlife_Refuge "National Wildlife Refuge").[[169]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-169) In addition to waterfowl, it is estimated that one third of the nation's endangered species seek food and shelter in areas protected using Duck Stamp funds.[[170]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-170)

Since 1934, the sale of Federal Duck Stamps has generated $670 million, and helped to purchase or lease 5,200,000 acres (8,100 sq mi; 21,000 km 2) of habitat. The stamps serve as a license to hunt migratory birds, an entrance pass for all National Wildlife Refuge areas, and are also considered collectors items often purchased for [aesthetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetic "Aesthetic") reasons outside of the hunting and birding communities. Although non-hunters buy a significant number of Duck Stamps, eighty-seven per cent of their sales are contributed by hunters. Distribution of funds is managed by the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission (MBCC).[[171]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-171)

The [Arabian oryx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabian_oryx "Arabian oryx"), a species of large [antelope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antelope "Antelope"), once inhabited much of the desert areas of the Middle East.[[155]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-Talbot,_Lee_Merriam_1960_pp._84-155) Native [Bedouin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedouin "Bedouin") tribes had long hunted the oryx using camels and arrows. Oil exploration made the habitat increasingly accessible, and the species' striking appearance made it (along with the closely related scimitar-horned oryx and addax) a popular quarry for sport hunters, including foreign executives of oil companies.[[172]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-172) The use of automobiles and high-powered rifles destroyed their only advantage: speed, and they became extinct in the wild exclusively due to sport hunting in 1972. The scimitar-horned oryx followed suit, while the addax became critically endangered.[[173]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-173) However, the Arabian oryx has now made a comeback and been upgraded from "extinct in the wild" to "vulnerable" due to conservation efforts like captive breeding.[[174]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-174)

The [markhor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markhor "Markhor") is an endangered species of wild goat which inhabits the mountains of [Central Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Asia "Central Asia") and [Pakistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan "Pakistan"). The [colonization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonization "Colonization") of these regions by [Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire "British Empire") gave British sport hunters access to the species, and they were hunted heavily, almost to the point of extinction. Only their willingness to breed in captivity and the inhospitability of their mountainous habitat prevented this. Despite these factors, the markhor is still endangered.[[175]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-175)

The [American bison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_bison "American bison") is a large [bovid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovid "Bovid") which inhabited much of western North America prior to the 1800s, living on the prairies in large herds. However, the vast herds of bison attracted market hunters, who killed dozens of bison for their hides only, leaving the rest to rot. Thousands of these hunters quickly eliminated the bison herds, bringing the population from several million in the early 1800s to a few hundred by the 1880s. Conservation efforts have allowed the population to increase, but the bison remains near-threatened due to lack of habitat.[[176]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-176)

The _Journal of International Wildlife Law and Policy_ cites that the legalization of white rhinoceros hunting in South Africa motivated private landowners to reintroduce the species onto their lands. As a result, the country saw an increase in white rhinos from fewer than one hundred individuals to more than 11,000, even while a limited number were killed as trophies.[[177]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-177)

However, the illegal hunting of rhinoceros for their horns is highly damaging to the population and is currently growing globally,[[178]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-178) with 1004 being killed in South Africa alone according to the most recent estimate.[[179]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-179) The White Rhino (along with the other 4 rhino species) are poached due to beliefs that the Rhinos horns can be used to cure Cancer, Arthritis and other diseases and illnesses, even though they are scientifically proven wrong.[[180]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-180)

According to [Richard Conniff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Conniff "Richard Conniff"), Namibia is home to 1,750 of the roughly 5,000 black rhinos surviving in the wild because it allows trophy hunting of various species. Namibia's mountain zebra population has increased to 27,000 from 1,000 in 1982. Elephants, which "are gunned down elsewhere for their ivory", have gone to 20,000 from 15,000 in 1995. Lions, which were on the brink of extinction "from Senegal to Kenya", are increasing in Namibia.[[181]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-181)

In contrast, Botswana in 2012 banned trophy hunting following a precipitous wildlife decline.[[182]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-182) The numbers of antelope plummeted across Botswana, with a resultant decline in predator numbers, while elephant numbers remained stable and hippopotamus numbers rose. According to the government of Botswana, trophy hunting is at least partly to blame for this, but many other factors, such as poaching, drought and habitat loss are also to blame.[[183]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-183) Uganda recently did the same, arguing that "the share of benefits of sport hunting were lopsided and unlikely to deter poaching or improve [Uganda's] capacity to manage the wildlife reserves."[[184]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-184) In 2020, Botswana reopened trophy hunting on public lands.[[185]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-185)

Cage [trap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapping#Trap_types "Trapping") ([live trap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapping#Cage_traps_(live_traps) "Trapping")) for [cheetahs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheetah "Cheetah") on a farm in [Namibia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namibia "Namibia")

A study published by the [Wildlife Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife_Society "Wildlife Society") concluded that hunting and trapping are cost effective tools that reduce wildlife damage by reducing a population below the capacity of the environment to carry it and changing the behaviors of animals to stop them from causing damage. The study furthermore states that the cessation of hunting could cause wildlife to be severely harmed, rural property values to fall, and the incentive of landowners to maintain natural habitats to diminish.[[186]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-186)

Although deforestation and forest degradation have long been considered the most significant threats to tropical biodiversity, across Southeast Asia (Northeast India, Indochina, Sundaland, Philippines) substantial areas of natural habitat have few wild animals (>1 kg), bar a few hunting‐tolerant species.[[187]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-187)[[188]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-188)[[189]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-189)

Animal rights activists argue that killing animals for sport is unethical, cruel, and unnecessary.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-:1-16) They note the suffering and cruelty inflicted on animals hunted for sport: "Many animals endure prolonged, painful deaths when they are injured but not killed by hunters. Hunting disrupts migration and hibernation patterns and destroys families."[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-:1-16) Animal rights activists also comment that hunting is not needed to maintain an [ecological balance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_balance "Ecological balance"), and that "nature takes care of its own".[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-:1-16) They say that hunting can be combated on public lands by "spread[ing] deer repellent or human hair (from barber shops) near hunting areas".[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-:1-16) Animal rights activists also argue that hunting is [speciesist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speciesism "Speciesism"):[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-:2-17)

> Whether hunters try to justify their killing by citing human deaths caused by wild animals, by making conservationist claims, by claiming that it's acceptable to hunt as long as the animals' bodies are eaten, or simply because of the pleasure it brings them, the fact remains that hunting is morally unacceptable if we consider the interests of nonhuman animals. Hunted animals endure fear and pain, and then are deprived of their lives. Understanding the injustices of speciesism and the interests of nonhuman animals makes it clear that human pleasure cannot justify nonhuman animals' pain.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting#cite_note-:2-17)

Second, hunting and other kinds of exploitation. These are followed by climate change, pollution, and invasive species, which are being spread by trade and other activities. Climate change will likely overtake the other threats in the next decades, the authors note. Driving these threats are the growing human population, which has doubled since 1970 to 7.6 billion, and consumption. (Per capita of use of materials is up 15% over the past 5 decades.)
