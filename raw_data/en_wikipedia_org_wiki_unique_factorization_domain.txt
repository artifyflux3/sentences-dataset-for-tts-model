Specifically, a UFD is an integral domain (a nontrivial commutative ring in which the product of any two non-zero elements is non-zero) in which every non-zero non- unit element can be written as a product of irreducible elements , uniquely up to order and units.

Important examples of UFDs are the integers and polynomial rings in one or more variables with coefficients coming from the integers or from a field .

Unique factorization domains appear in the following chain of class inclusions : rngs ⊃ rings ⊃ commutative rings ⊃ integral domains ⊃ integrally closed domains ⊃ GCD domains ⊃ unique factorization domains ⊃ principal ideal domains ⊃ euclidean domains ⊃ fields ⊃ algebraically closed fields Definition Formally, a unique factorization domain is defined to be an integral domain R in which every non-zero element x of R which is not a unit can be written as a finite product of irreducible elements p i of R : x = p 1 p 2 ⋅⋅⋅ p n with n ≥ 1 and this representation is unique in the following sense:
If q 1 , ..., q m are irreducible elements of R such that x = q 1 q 2 ⋅⋅⋅ q m with m ≥ 1 , then m = n , and there exists a bijective map φ : {1, ..., n } → {1, ..., m } such that p i is associated to q φ ( i ) for i ∈ {1, ..., n } .

Examples Most rings familiar from elementary mathematics are UFDs: All principal ideal domains , hence all Euclidean domains , are UFDs. In particular, the integers (also see Fundamental theorem of arithmetic ), the Gaussian integers and the Eisenstein integers are UFDs.

If R is a UFD, then so is R [ X ], the ring of polynomials with coefficients in R . Unless R is a field, R [ X ] is not a principal ideal domain. By induction, a polynomial ring in any number of variables over any UFD (and in particular over a field or over the integers) is a UFD.

The formal power series ring K [[ X 1 , ..., X n ]] over a field K (or more generally over a regular UFD such as a PID) is a UFD. On the other hand, the formal power series ring over a UFD need not be a UFD, even if the UFD is local . For example, if R is the localization of k [ x , y , z ]/( x 2 + y 3 + z 7 ) at the prime ideal ( x , y , z ) then R is a local ring that is a UFD, but the formal power series ring R [[ X ]] over R is not a UFD.

The Auslander–Buchsbaum theorem states that every regular local ring is a UFD.

Z [ e 2 π π i / n ] {\displaystyle \textstyle \mathbb {Z} {\bigl [}e^{2\pi i/n}{\bigr ]}} is a UFD for all integers 1 ≤ n ≤ 22 , but not for n = 23 .

Mori showed that if the completion of a Zariski ring , such as a Noetherian local ring , is a UFD, then the ring is a UFD.

[ 1 ] The converse of this is not true: there are Noetherian local rings that are UFDs but whose completions are not. The question of when this happens is rather subtle: for example, for the localization of k [ x , y , z ]/( x 2 + y 3 + z 5 ) at the prime ideal ( x , y , z ) , both the local ring and its completion are UFDs, but in the apparently similar example of  the localization of k [ x , y , z ]/( x 2 + y 3 + z 7 ) at the prime ideal ( x , y , z ) the local ring is a UFD but its completion is not.

Let R {\displaystyle R} be a field of any characteristic other than 2. Klein and Nagata showed that the ring R [ X 1 , ..., X n ]/ Q is a UFD whenever Q is a nonsingular quadratic form in the X s and n is at least 5. When n = 4 , the ring need not be a UFD. For example, R [ X , Y , Z , W ]/( XY − ZW ) is not a UFD, because the element XY equals the element ZW so that XY and ZW are two different factorizations of the same element into irreducibles.

The ring Q [ x , y ]/( x 2 + 2 y 2 + 1) is a UFD, but the ring Q ( i )[ x , y ]/( x 2 + 2 y 2 + 1) is not. On the other hand, The ring Q [ x , y ]/( x 2 + y 2 − 1) is not a UFD, but the ring Q ( i )[ x , y ]/( x 2 + y 2 − 1) is.

[ 2 ] Similarly the coordinate ring R [ X , Y , Z ]/( X 2 + Y 2 + Z 2 − 1) of the 2-dimensional real sphere is a UFD, but the coordinate ring C [ X , Y , Z ]/( X 2 + Y 2 + Z 2 − 1) of the complex sphere is not.

Suppose that the variables X i are given weights w i , and F ( X 1 , ..., X n ) is a homogeneous polynomial of weight w . Then if c is coprime to w and R is a UFD and either every finitely generated projective module over R is free or c is 1 mod w , the ring R [ X 1 , ..., X n , Z ]/( Z c − F ( X 1 , ..., X n )) is a UFD.

[ 3 ] Non-examples The quadratic integer ring Z [ − − 5 ] {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} [{\sqrt {-5}}]} of all complex numbers of the form a + b − − 5 {\displaystyle a+b{\sqrt {-5}}} , where a and b are integers, is not a UFD because 6 factors as both 2×3 and as ( 1 + − − 5 ) ( 1 − − − − 5 ) {\displaystyle \left(1+{\sqrt {-5}}\right)\left(1-{\sqrt {-5}}\right)} . These truly are different factorizations, because the only units in this ring are 1 and −1; thus, none of 2, 3, 1 + − − 5 {\displaystyle 1+{\sqrt {-5}}} , and 1 − − − − 5 {\displaystyle 1-{\sqrt {-5}}} are associate . It is not hard to show that all four factors are irreducible as well, though this may not be obvious.

[ 4 ] See also Algebraic integer .

For a square-free positive integer d , the ring of integers of Q [ − − d ] {\displaystyle \mathbb {Q} [{\sqrt {-d}}]} will fail to be a UFD unless d is a Heegner number .

The ring of formal power series over the complex numbers is a UFD, but the subring of those that converge everywhere, in other words the ring of entire functions in a single complex variable, is not a UFD, since there exist entire functions with an infinity of zeros, and thus an infinity of irreducible factors, while a UFD factorization must be finite, e.g.: sin ⁡ ⁡ π π z = π π z ∏ ∏ n = 1 ∞ ∞ ( 1 − − z 2 n 2 ) .

{\displaystyle \sin \pi z=\pi z\prod _{n=1}^{\infty }\left(1-{{z^{2}} \over {n^{2}}}\right).} Properties Some concepts defined for integers can be generalized to UFDs: In UFDs, every irreducible element is prime . (In any integral domain, every prime element is irreducible, but the converse does not always hold.  For instance, the element z ∈ K [ x , y , z ]/( z 2 − xy ) is irreducible, but not prime.) Note that this has a partial converse: a domain satisfying the ACCP is a UFD if and only if every irreducible element is prime.

Any two elements of a UFD have a greatest common divisor and a least common multiple . Here, a greatest common divisor of a and b is an element d that divides both a and b , and such that every other common divisor of a and b divides d . All greatest common divisors of a and b are associated .

Any UFD is integrally closed .  In other words, if R is a UFD with quotient field K , and if an element k in K is a root of a monic polynomial with coefficients in R , then k is an element of R .

Let S be a multiplicatively closed subset of a UFD A . Then the localization S −1 A is a UFD. A partial converse to this also holds; see below.

Equivalent conditions for a ring to be a UFD A Noetherian integral domain is a UFD if and only if every height 1 prime ideal is principal (a proof is given at the end). Also, a Dedekind domain is a UFD if and only if its ideal class group is trivial. In this case, it is in fact a principal ideal domain .

In general, for an integral domain A , the following conditions are equivalent: A is a UFD.

Every nonzero prime ideal of A contains a prime element .

[ 5 ] A satisfies ascending chain condition on principal ideals (ACCP), and the localization S −1 A is a UFD, where S is a multiplicatively closed subset of A generated by prime elements. (Nagata criterion) A satisfies ACCP and every irreducible is prime .

A is atomic and every irreducible is prime .

A is a GCD domain satisfying ACCP .

A is a Schreier domain , [ 6 ] and atomic .

A is a pre-Schreier domain and atomic .

A has a divisor theory in which every divisor is principal.

A is a Krull domain in which every divisorial ideal is principal (in fact, this is the definition of UFD in Bourbaki.) A is a Krull domain and every prime ideal of height 1 is principal.

[ 7 ] In practice, (2) and (3) are the most useful conditions to check. For example, it follows immediately from (2) that a PID is a UFD, since every prime ideal is generated by a prime element in a PID.

For another example, consider a Noetherian integral domain in which every height one prime ideal is principal. Since every prime ideal has finite height, it contains a height one prime ideal (induction on height) that is principal. By (2), the ring is a UFD.
