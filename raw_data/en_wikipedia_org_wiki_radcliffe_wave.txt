It stretches about 8,800 light years.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] This structure runs with the trajectory of the Milky Way arms.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] It lies at its closest (the Taurus Molecular Cloud ) at around 400 light-years and at its farthest about 5,000 light-years (the Cygnus X star complex) from the Sun , always within the Local Arm (Orion Arm) itself, spanning about 40% of its length and on average 20% of its width.

[ 5 ] [ 4 ] Its discovery was announced in January 2020, and its proximity surprised astronomers.

( May 2022 ) A clickable map of the nearby circa one-sixth outer sector of the galaxy, thus clearly showing the Local Arm (Orion Arm) and neighboring arms - as well as the Great Orion Nebula (as a very luminous feature of the less bright Orion molecular cloud complex ) and broad-clouds North America Nebula (and Pelican Nebula ) which is an intrinsic part of the Radcliffe wave.

Scientists do not know how the undulation of dust and gas formed. It has been suggested that it could be a result of a much smaller galaxy colliding with the Milky Way, leaving behind "ripples", or could be related to dark matter .

[ 1 ] [ 7 ] Inside the dense clouds, gas can be so compressed that new stars are born.

[ 2 ] It has been suggested that this may be where the Sun originated.

[ 1 ] Many of the star-forming regions found in the Radcliffe wave were thought to be part of a similar-sized but somewhat helio-centric ring which contained the Solar System , the " Gould Belt ".  It is now understood the nearest discrete relative concentration of sparse interstellar matter instead forms a massive wave.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Discovery [ edit ] The wave was discovered by an international team of astronomers including Catherine Zucker and João Alves.

[ 8 ] [ 4 ] It was announced by co-author Alyssa A. Goodman at the 235th meeting of the American Astronomical Society , held at Honolulu [ 9 ] and published in the journal Nature on 7 January 2020.

[ 10 ] The discovery was made using data collected by the European Space Agency 's Gaia space observatory.

[ 11 ] The wave was invisible in 2D , requiring new 3D techniques of mapping interstellar matter to reveal its pattern using the software Glue .

[ 2 ] [ 11 ] [ 9 ] The proximity of the wave surprised astronomers.

[ 1 ] [ 6 ] It is named after the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study in Cambridge, Massachusetts , the place of study of the team.

[ 11 ] Structure and movement [ edit ] The Radcliffe wave contains four of the five Gould Belt clouds: Orion molecular cloud complex Perseus molecular cloud Taurus molecular cloud Cepheus OB2 The cloud not within its scope is the Rho Ophiuchi Cloud complex , part of a linear structure parallel to the Radcliffe wave.

Other structures in the wave, further from the local star system, are Canis Major OB1 , the North America Nebula and Cygnus X .

[ 4 ] The mass of this structure is on the scale of ≥ ≥ 3 × × 10 6 {\displaystyle \geq 3\times 10^{6}} M ☉ . It has a length of 8,800 light-years (2,700 parsecs ) and an amplitude of 520 light-years (160 parsecs). The Radcliffe wave occupies about 20% of the width and 40% of the length of the local arm (Orion Arm) . The latter is more dispersed as to its interstellar medium than the wave and has further large star-forming regions such as Monoceros OB1 , California Nebula , Cepheus Far, and Rho Ophiuchi .

[ 4 ] A 2024 paper announced the discovery that the Radcliffe wave is oscillating in the form of a traveling wave .
