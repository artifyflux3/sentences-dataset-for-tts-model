Carduus nutans is a biennial plant in the daisy and sunflower family Asteraceae with the common names musk thistle , [ 1 ] nodding thistle , and nodding plumeless thistle . It is native to regions of Europe, Central Asia, and North Africa, where it is a scattered pasture plant.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] The musk thistle has been declared as invasive in North America, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa.

[ 3 ] Description [ edit ] Carduus nutans is a monocarpic herb and is classified as a biennial thistle, though it can have varying phenology depending on climate and habitat.

[ 5 ] Mature plants can reach 2.7 m (9 ft) in height with multi-branched stems. The leaves are prickly and jagged and can reach up to 40 cm (1.3 ft) in length.

[ 6 ] The leaves are dark green, coarsely bipinnately lobed, with a smooth, waxy surface and sharp yellow-brown to whitish spines at the tips of the lobes. They are more or less hairy on top, and wooly on the veins below.

[ 7 ] The stem is cottony/hairy, with thin ribs along them.

[ 6 ] The plants develop a rosette , with large leaves up to about 40 centimetres (16 inches) long.

[ 6 ] The seeds are able to germinate between 15 °C to 30 °C, thriving in conditions that offer moist soil and an alternating day/night temperature.

[ 8 ] A single plant is able to produce around 100 seeds per flower, up to about 20,000 seeds per plant.

[ 8 ] Seeds are mainly wind dispersed [ 5 ] and can survive in the soil seed bank for up to 20 years.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] Flowers [ edit ] Flower head Blooming in grassland habitat The plant bears showy flowers that range from a deep rose to violet color, rarely white.

[ 11 ] The large globose flower heads , containing hundreds of tiny individual flowers, are 3–5 cm ( 1 + 1 ⁄ 4 –2 in) (rarely to 7 cm) in diameter and occur at the tips of stems. The flower heads commonly droop to a 90° to 120° angle from the stem when mature, hence its alternate name of "nodding thistle". Each plant may produce thousands of straw-colored seeds adorned with plume-like bristles. They are 4 to 6 cm across, with purple-red bracts .

The number of flower heads per plant is site-dependent and ranges from about 20–50 on good sites and 1–20 on poor sites. Flowering occurs from June to October, [ 12 ] and seed dissemination occurs approximately one month after the flowers form.

Distribution and habitat [ edit ] Carduus nutans is native to Europe, Western Siberia, Asia, and North Africa.

[ 13 ] It has become invasive in North America, Australia, New Zealand, and Southern Africa.

[ 9 ] It is abundant in the North American Rocky Mountains .

[ 12 ] The plant can grow at least to an elevation of 1,830 m (6,000 ft).

[ 14 ] [ 15 ] It typically grows in meadows and grasslands , in heavily grazed land in areas such as pastures, and on open disturbed soil such as roadsides and building sites.

[ 12 ] It is found in neutral to acidic soils . It spreads rapidly in areas subjected to frequent natural disturbances such as landslides and flooding, but does not grow well in excessively wet, dry, or shady conditions.

Uses [ edit ] Medicinal [ edit ] Herbal decoctions have historically included Carduus nutans.

Turkish folk medicine has used parts of the flowering branches to treat prostate disease.

[ 16 ] It has also been documented that it has been used for treatment of liver disease, malaria, constipation, and kidney stones.

[ 17 ] Ecology [ edit ] Climate and habitat play a large role in phenology of Carduus nutans . Classified as a biennial, it can also act as a summer or winter annual, as well as a perennial, depending on varying environmental conditions.

[ 8 ] Invasive species [ edit ] C. nutans is an invasive species in various regions around the world, including in disturbed and agricultural settings, pastures, rangelands, along roadsides, and in natural habitats .

[ 18 ] [ 19 ] The first report of C. nutans in the United States was in Pennsylvania in 1852.

[ 20 ] It is declared a noxious weed in many U.S. states , Canadian provinces , South Africa , New Zealand , and Australia .

[ 21 ] The plant is especially fertile, producing up to 20,000 seeds per plant, [ 8 ] that allows it to take root quickly and replace natural vegetation.

[ 19 ] [ 22 ] Pastures and rangelands suffer from decreased productivity and the sharp spines of the plant make an unsuitable grazing area for livestock.

[ 19 ] [ 8 ] Biological control [ edit ] Several biological control agents have been released in attempt to control C. nutans.

In Australia, some of those that have been released include Rhinocyllus conicus , Urophora solstitialis , and Trichosirocalus horridus .

[ 23 ] In the United States there has been success with Rhinocyllus conicus , Trichosirocalus horridus , and Puccinia carduorum.

[ 19 ] Previous populations in Southern California were eradicated, but it remains in northern California .

[ 24 ] When biological control is successful, natural plants are shown to return to the habitat.

[ 19 ] Effects on biodiversity [ edit ] C. nutans reduces forage biomass availability for livestock through competition for nutrients [ 8 ] The spiny plants affect movement of animals through the area, further decreasing availability of forage biomass.

[ 8 ] It also causes soil erosion on roadways and wastelands.
