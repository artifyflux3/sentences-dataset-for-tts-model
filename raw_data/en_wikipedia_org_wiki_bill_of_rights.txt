For specific bills of rights, see United States Bill of Rights , English Bill of Rights , and § List of bills of rights . For other uses, see Bill of Rights (disambiguation) .

"Charter of rights" redirects here. For the Canadian constitutional charter, see Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .

The Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen of 1789 is a fundamental document of the French Revolution and in the history of human rights .

Draft of the United States Bill of Rights , also from 1789 A bill of rights , sometimes called a declaration of rights or a charter of rights , is a list of the most important rights to the citizens of a country.  The purpose is to protect those rights against infringement from public officials and private citizens .

[ 1 ] Bills of rights may be entrenched or unentrenched . An entrenched bill of rights cannot be amended or repealed by a country's legislature through regular procedure, instead requiring a supermajority or referendum; often it is part of a country's constitution, and therefore subject to special procedures applicable to constitutional amendments.

History [ edit ] The history of legal charters asserting certain  rights for particular groups goes back to the Middle Ages and earlier. An example is Magna Carta , an English legal charter agreed between the King and his barons in 1215.

[ 2 ] In the early modern period , there was renewed interest in Magna Carta .

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] English common law judge Sir Edward Coke revived the idea of rights based on citizenship (see history of citizenship ) by arguing that Englishmen had historically enjoyed such rights . The Petition of Right 1628 , the Habeas Corpus Act 1679 and the Bill of Rights 1689 (English Bill of Rights) established certain rights in statute.

In the Thirteen Colonies , the English Bill of Rights was one of the influences on the 1776 Virginia Declaration of Rights , which in turn influenced the United States Declaration of Independence later that year.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] After the Constitution of the United States was adopted in 1789, the United States Bill of Rights was ratified in 1791. The U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights were influenced by British constitutional history .

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] Inspired by the Age of Enlightenment , the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen asserted the universality of rights.

[ 10 ] It was adopted in 1789 by France's National Constituent Assembly , during the period of the French Revolution .

The 20th century saw different groups draw on these earlier documents for influence when drafting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the European Convention on Human Rights and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child .

[ 11 ] Exceptions in Western democracies [ edit ] The constitution of the United Kingdom remains uncodified.

[ 2 ] However, the Bill of Rights 1689 is part of UK law. The Human Rights Act 1998 also incorporates the rights contained in the European Convention on Human Rights into UK law. In the 21st century, there were proposals for a British Bill of Rights and the UK Parliament debated a Bill of Rights Bill but it was not passed into legislation.

Australia is the only common law country with neither a constitutional nor federal legislative bill of rights to protect its citizens, although there is ongoing debate in many of Australia's states.

[ 12 ] [ 13 ] In 1973, Federal Attorney-General Lionel Murphy introduced a human rights Bill into parliament, although it was never passed.

[ 14 ] In 1984, Senator Gareth Evans drafted a Bill of Rights, but it was never introduced into parliament, and in 1985, Senator Lionel Bowen introduced a bill of rights, which was passed by the House of Representatives , but failed to pass the Senate .

[ 14 ] Former Australian Prime Minister John Howard has argued against a bill of rights for Australia on the grounds it would transfer power from elected politicians to unelected judges and bureaucrats .

[ 15 ] [ 16 ] Victoria , Queensland and the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) are the only states and territories to have a human rights Act.

[ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] However, the principle of legality present in the Australian judicial system, seeks to ensure that legislation is interpreted so as not to interfere with basic human rights, unless legislation expressly intends to interfere.

[ 20 ] List of bills of rights [ edit ] The Bill of Rights 1689 is an Act of the Parliament of England asserting certain rights.

Britain in its history proposed many pioneering documents – not only Magna Carta, 1215 but those such as the Provisions of Oxford 1258, the Petition of Right 1628, the Bill of Rights 1689, and the Claim of Right 1689 ^ "From legal document to public myth: Magna Carta in the 17th century" .

The earliest, and perhaps greatest, victory for liberalism was achieved in England. The rising commercial class that had supported the Tudor monarchy in the 16th century led the revolutionary battle in the 17th and succeeded in establishing the supremacy of Parliament and, eventually, of the House of Commons. What emerged as the distinctive feature of modern constitutionalism was not the insistence on the idea that the king is subject to law (although this concept is an essential attribute of all constitutionalism). This notion was already well established in the Middle Ages. What was distinctive was the establishment of effective means of political control whereby the rule of law might be enforced. Modern constitutionalism was born with the political requirement that representative government depended upon the consent of citizen subjects... However, as can be seen through provisions in the 1689 Bill of Rights, the English Revolution was fought not just to protect the rights of property (in the narrow sense) but to establish those liberties which liberals believed essential to human dignity and moral worth. The "rights of man" enumerated in the English Bill of Rights gradually were proclaimed beyond the boundaries of England, notably in the American Declaration of Independence of 1776 and in the French Declaration of the Rights of Man in 1789.
