[ 1 ] [ 2 ] This document is a voluntary guidance standard for supporting vulnerable persons in an emergency.

Background and purpose [ edit ] When emergencies strike, it is important that people are safe. However, some people are at more risk during an emergency. Traditionally, the focus has been on the special needs of children, the elderly and persons with disabilities. However, this is a narrow definition of vulnerability. Increasingly, communities are taking a more holistic view and are looking to address the needs of persons who are socially isolated, lacking language skills, impoverished or marginalized.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] This international standard provides guidance on types of vulnerability and how to address the needs of people in vulnerable situations in an emergency. It provides recommendations on how to develop an overall plan. It also provides practical tips and strategies for moving vulnerable people from an affected area, providing support, long term recovery, and communication with affected persons and community stakeholders. The standard gives recommendations on how to evaluate the processes to support vulnerable people and how to continually improve the overall plan going forward.
