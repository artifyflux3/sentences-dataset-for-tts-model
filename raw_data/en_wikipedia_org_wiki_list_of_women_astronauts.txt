For other uses, see Spacewoman .

In 1963 Soviet cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova became the first woman in space on her Vostok 6 flight of 48 orbits, and is the only woman to fly solo in space.

The following is a list of women who have traveled into space , sorted by date of first flight. This list includes Russian cosmonauts , who were the first women in outer space.

Valentina Tereshkova became the first woman to go to space in 1963, very early in crewed space exploration , and it would be almost twenty years before another flew ( Svetlana Savitskaya ).

By the end of the 1980s, women in space had become more common. By 2019, roughly 12% of all the space travelers were women. As of April 2025 [update] , 105 women had completed spaceflights.

History [ edit ] As of May 2023 [update] , there has been one female space traveler each from France, Italy, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, and the United Kingdom; two each from Canada and Japan; three from China; six from the Soviet Union/Russia; and 56 from the United States.

[ 1 ] The time between the first male and first female astronauts varied widely by country. The first astronauts originally from Britain, South Korea, and Iran were women, while there was a two-year gap in Russia from the first man in space on Vostok 1 to the first woman in space on Vostok 6 . The time between the first American man and first American woman in space was 22 years between Freedom 7 and STS-7 , respectively. For China, this interval was almost eight and a half years between the Shenzhou 5 and Shenzhou 9 space missions, [ 2 ] and for Italy, there was approximately twelve years between the STS-46 and Expedition 42 spaceflights.

A span of 19 years separated the first two women in space. They were cosmonauts on the Vostok 6 and Soyuz T-7 missions. Though the Soviet Union sent the first two women into space, only six of the women in space have been Russian or Soviet citizens. However, British, French, Italian, dual-citizen Iranian-American and South Korean women have all flown as part of the Soviet and Russian space programs. Similarly, women from Canada, Japan, and America have all flown under the US space program. A span of one year separated the first and second American women in space, [ 3 ] as well as the first and second Chinese women in space, taking place on consecutive missions, Shenzhou 9 and Shenzhou 10.
