They were introduced by and named after Karl Stein ( 1951 ). A Stein space is similar to a Stein manifold but is allowed to have singularities. Stein spaces are the analogues of affine varieties or affine schemes in algebraic geometry.

Definition [ edit ] Suppose X {\displaystyle X} is a complex manifold of complex dimension n {\displaystyle n} and let O ( X ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {O}}(X)} denote the ring of holomorphic functions on X .

{\displaystyle X.} We call X {\displaystyle X} a Stein manifold if the following conditions hold: X {\displaystyle X} is holomorphically convex, i.e. for every compact subset K ⊂ ⊂ X {\displaystyle K\subset X} , the so-called holomorphically convex hull , K ¯ ¯ = { z ∈ ∈ X | | f ( z ) | ≤ ≤ sup w ∈ ∈ K | f ( w ) | ∀ ∀ f ∈ ∈ O ( X ) } , {\displaystyle {\bar {K}}=\left\{z\in X\,\left|\,|f(z)|\leq \sup _{w\in K}|f(w)|\ \forall f\in {\mathcal {O}}(X)\right.\right\},} is also a compact subset of X {\displaystyle X} .

X {\displaystyle X} is holomorphically separable, i.e. if x ≠ ≠ y {\displaystyle x\neq y} are two points in X {\displaystyle X} , then there exists f ∈ ∈ O ( X ) {\displaystyle f\in {\mathcal {O}}(X)} such that f ( x ) ≠ ≠ f ( y ) .

{\displaystyle f(x)\neq f(y).} Non-compact Riemann surfaces are Stein manifolds [ edit ] Let X be a connected, non-compact Riemann surface . A deep theorem of Heinrich Behnke and Stein (1948) asserts that X is a Stein manifold.

Another result, attributed to Hans Grauert and Helmut Röhrl (1956), states moreover that every holomorphic vector bundle on X is trivial. In particular, every line bundle is trivial, so H 1 ( X , O X ∗ ∗ ) = 0 {\displaystyle H^{1}(X,{\mathcal {O}}_{X}^{*})=0} . The exponential sheaf sequence leads to the following exact sequence: H 1 ( X , O X ) ⟶ ⟶ H 1 ( X , O X ∗ ∗ ) ⟶ ⟶ H 2 ( X , Z ) ⟶ ⟶ H 2 ( X , O X ) {\displaystyle H^{1}(X,{\mathcal {O}}_{X})\longrightarrow H^{1}(X,{\mathcal {O}}_{X}^{*})\longrightarrow H^{2}(X,\mathbb {Z} )\longrightarrow H^{2}(X,{\mathcal {O}}_{X})} Now Cartan's theorem B shows that H 1 ( X , O X ) = H 2 ( X , O X ) = 0 {\displaystyle H^{1}(X,{\mathcal {O}}_{X})=H^{2}(X,{\mathcal {O}}_{X})=0} , therefore H 2 ( X , Z ) = 0 {\displaystyle H^{2}(X,\mathbb {Z} )=0} .

This is related to the solution of the second Cousin problem .

Properties and examples of Stein manifolds [ edit ] The standard complex space C n {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} ^{n}} is a Stein manifold.

Every domain of holomorphy in C n {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} ^{n}} is a Stein manifold.

Every closed complex submanifold of a Stein manifold is a Stein manifold, too.

The embedding theorem for Stein manifolds states the following: Every Stein manifold X {\displaystyle X} of complex dimension n {\displaystyle n} can be embedded into C 2 n + 1 {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} ^{2n+1}} by a biholomorphic proper map .

These facts imply that a Stein manifold is a closed complex submanifold of complex space, whose complex structure is that of the ambient space (because the embedding is biholomorphic).

Every Stein manifold of (complex) dimension n has the homotopy type of an n -dimensional CW-complex.

In one complex dimension the Stein condition can be simplified: a connected Riemann surface is a Stein manifold if and only if it is not compact.  This can be proved using a version of the Runge theorem for Riemann surfaces, due to Behnke and Stein.

Every Stein manifold X {\displaystyle X} is holomorphically spreadable, i.e. for every point x ∈ ∈ X {\displaystyle x\in X} , there are n {\displaystyle n} holomorphic functions defined on all of X {\displaystyle X} which form a local coordinate system when restricted to some open neighborhood of x {\displaystyle x} .

Being a Stein manifold is equivalent to being a (complex) strongly pseudoconvex manifold . The latter means that it has a strongly pseudoconvex (or plurisubharmonic ) exhaustive function, i.e. a smooth real function ψ ψ {\displaystyle \psi } on X {\displaystyle X} (which can be assumed to be a Morse function ) with i ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ¯ ¯ ψ ψ > 0 {\displaystyle i\partial {\bar {\partial }}\psi >0} , such that the subsets { z ∈ ∈ X ∣ ∣ ψ ψ ( z ) ≤ ≤ c } {\displaystyle \{z\in X\mid \psi (z)\leq c\}} are compact in X {\displaystyle X} for every real number c {\displaystyle c} . This is a solution to the so-called Levi problem , [ 1 ] named after Eugenio Levi (1911). The function ψ ψ {\displaystyle \psi } invites a generalization of Stein manifold to the idea of a corresponding class of compact complex manifolds with boundary called Stein domains . A Stein domain is the preimage { z ∣ ∣ − − ∞ ∞ ≤ ≤ ψ ψ ( z ) ≤ ≤ c } {\displaystyle \{z\mid -\infty \leq \psi (z)\leq c\}} . Some authors call such manifolds therefore strictly pseudoconvex manifolds.

Related to the previous item, another equivalent and more topological definition in complex dimension 2 is the following: a Stein surface is a complex surface X with a real-valued Morse function f on X such that, away from the critical points of f , the field of complex tangencies to the preimage X c = f − − 1 ( c ) {\displaystyle X_{c}=f^{-1}(c)} is a contact structure that induces an orientation on X c agreeing with the usual orientation as the boundary of f − − 1 ( − − ∞ ∞ , c ) .

{\displaystyle f^{-1}(-\infty ,c).} That is, f − − 1 ( − − ∞ ∞ , c ) {\displaystyle f^{-1}(-\infty ,c)} is a Stein filling of X c .

Numerous further characterizations of such manifolds exist, in particular capturing the property of their having "many" holomorphic functions taking values in the complex numbers. See for example Cartan's theorems A and B , relating to sheaf cohomology . The initial impetus was to have a description of the properties of the domain of definition of the (maximal) analytic continuation of an analytic function .

In the GAGA set of analogies, Stein manifolds correspond to affine varieties .

Stein manifolds are in some sense dual to the elliptic manifolds in complex analysis which admit "many" holomorphic functions from the complex numbers into themselves.  It is known that a Stein manifold is elliptic if and only if it is fibrant in the sense of so-called "holomorphic homotopy theory".

Relation to smooth manifolds [ edit ] Every compact smooth manifold of dimension 2 n , which has only handles of index ≤ n , has a Stein structure provided n > 2, and when n = 2 the same holds provided the 2-handles are attached with certain framings (framing less than the Thurston–Bennequin framing ).

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] Every closed smooth 4-manifold is a union of two Stein 4-manifolds glued along their common boundary.
