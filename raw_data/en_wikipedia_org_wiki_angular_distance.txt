When the rays are lines of sight from an observer to two points in space, it is known as the apparent distance or apparent separation .

Angular distance appears in mathematics (in particular geometry and trigonometry ) and all natural sciences (e.g., kinematics , astronomy , and geophysics ). In the classical mechanics of rotating objects, it appears alongside angular velocity , angular acceleration , angular momentum , moment of inertia and torque .

Use [ edit ] The term angular distance (or separation ) is technically synonymous with angle itself, but is meant to suggest the linear distance between objects (for instance, a pair of stars observed from Earth ).

Measurement [ edit ] Since the angular distance (or separation) is conceptually identical to an angle, it is measured in the same units , such as degrees or radians , using instruments such as goniometers or optical instruments specially designed to point in well-defined directions and record the corresponding angles (such as telescopes ).

Formulation [ edit ] Angular separation θ θ {\displaystyle \theta } between points A and B as seen from O To derive the equation that describes the angular separation of two points located on the surface of a sphere as seen from the center of the sphere, we use the example of two astronomical objects A {\displaystyle A} and B {\displaystyle B} observed from the Earth. The objects A {\displaystyle A} and B {\displaystyle B} are defined by their celestial coordinates , namely their right ascensions (RA) , ( α α A , α α B ) ∈ ∈ [ 0 , 2 π π ] {\displaystyle (\alpha _{A},\alpha _{B})\in [0,2\pi ]} ; and declinations (dec) , ( δ δ A , δ δ B ) ∈ ∈ [ − − π π / 2 , π π / 2 ] {\displaystyle (\delta _{A},\delta _{B})\in [-\pi /2,\pi /2]} . Let O {\displaystyle O} indicate the observer on Earth, assumed to be located at the center of the celestial sphere . The dot product of the vectors O A {\displaystyle \mathbf {OA} } and O B {\displaystyle \mathbf {OB} } is equal to: O A ⋅ ⋅ O B = R 2 cos ⁡ ⁡ θ θ {\displaystyle \mathbf {OA} \cdot \mathbf {OB} =R^{2}\cos \theta } which is equivalent to: n A ⋅ ⋅ n B = cos ⁡ ⁡ θ θ {\displaystyle \mathbf {n_{A}} \cdot \mathbf {n_{B}} =\cos \theta } In the ( x , y , z ) {\displaystyle (x,y,z)} frame, the two unitary vectors are decomposed into: n A = ( cos ⁡ ⁡ δ δ A cos ⁡ ⁡ α α A cos ⁡ ⁡ δ δ A sin ⁡ ⁡ α α A sin ⁡ ⁡ δ δ A ) a n d n B = ( cos ⁡ ⁡ δ δ B cos ⁡ ⁡ α α B cos ⁡ ⁡ δ δ B sin ⁡ ⁡ α α B sin ⁡ ⁡ δ δ B ) .

{\displaystyle \mathbf {n_{A}} ={\begin{pmatrix}\cos \delta _{A}\cos \alpha _{A}\\\cos \delta _{A}\sin \alpha _{A}\\\sin \delta _{A}\end{pmatrix}}\mathrm {\qquad and\qquad } \mathbf {n_{B}} ={\begin{pmatrix}\cos \delta _{B}\cos \alpha _{B}\\\cos \delta _{B}\sin \alpha _{B}\\\sin \delta _{B}\end{pmatrix}}.} Therefore, n A ⋅ ⋅ n B = cos ⁡ ⁡ δ δ A cos ⁡ ⁡ α α A cos ⁡ ⁡ δ δ B cos ⁡ ⁡ α α B + cos ⁡ ⁡ δ δ A sin ⁡ ⁡ α α A cos ⁡ ⁡ δ δ B sin ⁡ ⁡ α α B + sin ⁡ ⁡ δ δ A sin ⁡ ⁡ δ δ B ≡ ≡ cos ⁡ ⁡ θ θ {\displaystyle \mathbf {n_{A}} \cdot \mathbf {n_{B}} =\cos \delta _{A}\cos \alpha _{A}\cos \delta _{B}\cos \alpha _{B}+\cos \delta _{A}\sin \alpha _{A}\cos \delta _{B}\sin \alpha _{B}+\sin \delta _{A}\sin \delta _{B}\equiv \cos \theta } then: θ θ = cos − − 1 ⁡ ⁡ [ sin ⁡ ⁡ δ δ A sin ⁡ ⁡ δ δ B + cos ⁡ ⁡ δ δ A cos ⁡ ⁡ δ δ B cos ⁡ ⁡ ( α α A − − α α B ) ] {\displaystyle \theta =\cos ^{-1}\left[\sin \delta _{A}\sin \delta _{B}+\cos \delta _{A}\cos \delta _{B}\cos(\alpha _{A}-\alpha _{B})\right]} Small angular distance approximation [ edit ] The above expression is valid for any position of A and B on the sphere. In astronomy, it often happens that the considered objects are really close in the sky: stars in a telescope field of view, binary stars, the satellites of the giant planets of the Solar System , etc. In the case where θ θ ≪ ≪ 1 {\displaystyle \theta \ll 1} radian, implying α α A − − α α B ≪ ≪ 1 {\displaystyle \alpha _{A}-\alpha _{B}\ll 1} and δ δ A − − δ δ B ≪ ≪ 1 {\displaystyle \delta _{A}-\delta _{B}\ll 1} , we can develop the above expression and simplify it. In the small-angle approximation , at second order, the above expression becomes: cos ⁡ ⁡ θ θ ≈ ≈ 1 − − θ θ 2 2 ≈ ≈ sin ⁡ ⁡ δ δ A sin ⁡ ⁡ δ δ B + cos ⁡ ⁡ δ δ A cos ⁡ ⁡ δ δ B [ 1 − − ( α α A − − α α B ) 2 2 ] {\displaystyle \cos \theta \approx 1-{\frac {\theta ^{2}}{2}}\approx \sin \delta _{A}\sin \delta _{B}+\cos \delta _{A}\cos \delta _{B}\left[1-{\frac {(\alpha _{A}-\alpha _{B})^{2}}{2}}\right]} meaning 1 − − θ θ 2 2 ≈ ≈ cos ⁡ ⁡ ( δ δ A − − δ δ B ) − − cos ⁡ ⁡ δ δ A cos ⁡ ⁡ δ δ B ( α α A − − α α B ) 2 2 {\displaystyle 1-{\frac {\theta ^{2}}{2}}\approx \cos(\delta _{A}-\delta _{B})-\cos \delta _{A}\cos \delta _{B}{\frac {(\alpha _{A}-\alpha _{B})^{2}}{2}}} hence 1 − − θ θ 2 2 ≈ ≈ 1 − − ( δ δ A − − δ δ B ) 2 2 − − cos ⁡ ⁡ δ δ A cos ⁡ ⁡ δ δ B ( α α A − − α α B ) 2 2 {\displaystyle 1-{\frac {\theta ^{2}}{2}}\approx 1-{\frac {(\delta _{A}-\delta _{B})^{2}}{2}}-\cos \delta _{A}\cos \delta _{B}{\frac {(\alpha _{A}-\alpha _{B})^{2}}{2}}} .

Given that δ δ A − − δ δ B ≪ ≪ 1 {\displaystyle \delta _{A}-\delta _{B}\ll 1} and α α A − − α α B ≪ ≪ 1 {\displaystyle \alpha _{A}-\alpha _{B}\ll 1} , at a second-order development it turns that cos ⁡ ⁡ δ δ A cos ⁡ ⁡ δ δ B ( α α A − − α α B ) 2 2 ≈ ≈ cos 2 ⁡ ⁡ δ δ A ( α α A − − α α B ) 2 2 {\displaystyle \cos \delta _{A}\cos \delta _{B}{\frac {(\alpha _{A}-\alpha _{B})^{2}}{2}}\approx \cos ^{2}\delta _{A}{\frac {(\alpha _{A}-\alpha _{B})^{2}}{2}}} , so that θ θ ≈ ≈ [ ( α α A − − α α B ) cos ⁡ ⁡ δ δ A ] 2 + ( δ δ A − − δ δ B ) 2 {\displaystyle \theta \approx {\sqrt {\left[(\alpha _{A}-\alpha _{B})\cos \delta _{A}\right]^{2}+(\delta _{A}-\delta _{B})^{2}}}} Small angular distance: planar approximation [ edit ] Planar approximation of angular distance on sky If we consider a detector imaging a small sky field (dimension much less than one radian) with the y {\displaystyle y} -axis pointing up, parallel to the meridian of right ascension α α {\displaystyle \alpha } , and the x {\displaystyle x} -axis along the parallel of declination δ δ {\displaystyle \delta } , the angular separation can be written as: θ θ ≈ ≈ δ δ x 2 + δ δ y 2 {\displaystyle \theta \approx {\sqrt {\delta x^{2}+\delta y^{2}}}} where δ δ x = ( α α A − − α α B ) cos ⁡ ⁡ δ δ A {\displaystyle \delta x=(\alpha _{A}-\alpha _{B})\cos \delta _{A}} and δ δ y = δ δ A − − δ δ B {\displaystyle \delta y=\delta _{A}-\delta _{B}} .

Note that the y {\displaystyle y} -axis is equal to the declination, whereas the x {\displaystyle x} -axis is the right ascension modulated by cos ⁡ ⁡ δ δ A {\displaystyle \cos \delta _{A}} because the section of a sphere of radius R {\displaystyle R} at declination (latitude) δ δ {\displaystyle \delta } is R ′ = R cos ⁡ ⁡ δ δ A {\displaystyle R'=R\cos \delta _{A}} (see Figure).
