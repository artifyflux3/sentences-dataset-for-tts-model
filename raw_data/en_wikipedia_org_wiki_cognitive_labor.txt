Cognitive labor is sociological and feminist concept referring to the invisible mental work many women do in relationships and families.

[ 1 ] It is related to invisible labor , emotional labor , and unpaid work [ 2 ] while emphasizing the cost of planning, organizing, scheduling, managing and worrying, in addition to "executing." [ 3 ] [ 4 ] The distribution of cognitive labor falls disproportionately on women.

[ 5 ] Handling the majority of cognitive labor is a burden that prevents women from pursuing opportunities or achieving greater health and happiness.

[ 6 ] A recommendation for balancing cognitive labor is making it more explicit and visible.
