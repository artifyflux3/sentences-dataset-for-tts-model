[ 4 ] History [ edit ] Miles City, 1881 After the Battle of the Little Bighorn in 1876, the U.S. Army created forts in eastern Montana, including one where the north-flowing Tongue River flowed into the east-flowing Yellowstone River . The first fort was known as the Tongue River Cantonment or the Tongue River Barracks and was founded on August 27, 1876. A second, permanent fort was constructed on higher ground two miles to the west of the mouth of the Tongue and this became Fort Keogh.

Fort Keogh (named after Captain Myles Keogh, one of the battle dead, whose horse, Comanche, was the lone survivor of Custer's command) started as a few rough winter cabins, but grew into a moderate sized western fort, from which its commander, General Nelson A. Miles , effectively brought the remaining "uncontrolled" Native Americans into subjugation during the last decade of the 1800s.

[ 5 ] Nelson Miles said that "whiskey caused him more trouble than the Indians" and, after tiring of drunken soldiers causing problems during the winter campaign, evicted the sutlers who provided "liquid stock" in the spring of 1877. Moving two miles due east of the Tongue River Cantonment, these early merchants founded the first Miles City. Although fondly referred to as "Milestown," the first post office and first official plat both called the town "Miles City." When the old cantonment moved two miles west, the town literally picked up and followed, moving to the current site. The last occupants of Old Miles City stayed on until 1900 but the new community was the one that grew.

Before the town itself was founded, George Miles, the nephew of General Miles, who had accompanied his uncle on the western expedition and served in the quartermasters office, bought a herd of sheep, the first of many commercial enterprises in his involvement with the core founders of the town.

Livestock speculation brought thousands of cattle to the open ranges in the late 1880s, the railroad was extended through the area, and Texans drove numerous cattle to Miles City to fatten them on free grass and move them to where they could be loaded on trains bound for the slaughterhouses in Chicago ( Milwaukee Railroad ).

The burgeoning settlement of Miles City was incorporated as a town in 1887 and the first mayor to serve was Eugene Henry "Skew" Johnson (born July 27, 1846, in Clarksville, Arkansas , died July 31, 1919, in Miles City, Montana) who served for one term.

Miles City established a municipal electric power  utility company around that time of 1887 and it was a source of civic pride (as any city would have towards its own utilities) until during the 1920s, a traveling employee of Minnesota Northern Power (predecessor of current MDU Resources Group, Inc.

) told the city council "the emperor has no clothes;" i.e., the system was far less efficient and in worse shape than they thought. The city council eventually put the question to the voters who instructed the city to sell the utility. By this time, the people with the competing Montana Power Company (now NorthWestern Energy's Montana division) became aware of this and were soon locked in an epic battle with Minnesota Northern over the franchise. A franchise election was held to determine who would serve Miles City on June 28, 1927. Minnesota Northern won by a scant 16 votes.

Miles City experienced rapid growth until the First World War (1914/1917–1918), era and following 1920s and 1930s, but became overshadowed by the upstart upriver town of Billings , which was at the cross roads of various land transportation routes. Billings became a center for banking and finance, oil refining, and medical services, and is now the largest city in the state of Montana.

The publicly owned Miles City Municipal Airport is located less than two miles (3.2 km) from town. Notably, it was during the beginning of the modern aviation era as the site of an early tragic scheduled airline passenger plane crash, involving Northwest Airlines Flight 1 , which caught fire and crashed shortly after takeoff in January 1939.

Geography [ edit ] Aerial photograph of Miles City from the southwest Miles City sits within the High Plains of the Great Plains, and is nestled between the Tongue and Yellowstone rivers.

[ 6 ] According to the United States Census Bureau , the city has a total area of 3.34 square miles (8.65 km 2 ), all land.

[ 7 ] Interstate 94 passes through the community, with access from Exits 135, 138, and 141.

Montana Highway 59 runs north–south. The Tongue River flows into Yellowstone River at the town.

Pirogue Island State Park is just outside of town.

[ 21 ] [ 22 ] Eastern Montana Fair [ edit ] Ted Kennedy riding saddle-bronc at the Eastern Montana Fair rodeo , August 27, 1960.

The Eastern Montana Fair is held in the latter half of August at the Custer County fairgrounds, and its rodeo, demolition derby, fireworks and concerts typically attract about 17,000 attendees.

[ 23 ] Education [ edit ] Miles Community College was founded in 1939. The current average student to faculty ratio is 11:1; class sizes range from 8 to 50 students; and over 85% of the students qualify for financial aid. Miles Community College also features free tutoring at the Center for Academic Success. The Judson H. Flower, Jr. Library is located within the main building of Miles Community College, and is equipped with computer lab and INFOTRAC.

Custer County District High School is the only secondary school in the entire county; some students unfortunately have to drive as many as 60 miles (97 km) to attend High school. It was founded in the late 1880s as the "Miles City High School" and graduated its first class in 1893. A decade later, it was renamed to reflect it's wider population as the Custer County High School in 1903 and graduated its first expanded class in 1904. Much of the current student body population's livelihood involves agriculture or ranching – entirely or in part; therefore, the local young farmers group of the National FFA Organization (Future Farmers of America) organization is very active and about 20% of the student population belong to it. The high school is famous for its musical Chorale, which travels extensively including a trip to the famous Carnegie Hall in New York City in 2005 and a trip to the national federal capital city of Washington D.C. in 2007. The Custer County high school claims that its seniors have an average ACT score of 23 and that 57% of the graduating seniors go on to complete their higher education at a 4-year university.

Miles City also has additional public schools with 4 elementary schools: Lincoln (grades 3–6), Highland Park (grades K to 2), Jefferson (K to 2), Garfield (grades 1–6). There is also a middle school at the Washington School (grades 7 and 8). Washington Middle School has many extra curricular activities, including sports, builder's club and student council. There is also one local parochial school in the county and town of the Roman Catholic Church , at Sacred Heart Parish School (pre K to grade 8).

The Miles City Public Library serves the area with a library building plus through its internet website for online access with connections to various other academic institutions and statewide public libraries.

[ 24 ] Places of interest [ edit ] The highest point in the vicinity is Signal Butte (3,051 feet / 930 meters above sea level), said to have been used by Native Americans for communication, but used for decades by radio and sometimes TV antennas. Signal Butte lies at the edge of an area of badlands , a striking arid vista of eroded sedimentary soil, sporting multi-colored layers exposed by the erosion. The land contains sandstone formations in the midst of sagebrush and cedar trees growing in a soil that turns to gumbo when wet. Airport Hill is the elevated bluff of the north bank of the Yellowstone River, and Paragon Pit is a remote area of the north bank opposite of Fort Keogh frequented by teenagers over the years. 12 Mile Dam spans the Tongue River and attracts teens in the summer for water sport. Being shallow, the Tongue River is often used for tubing . The former Fort Keogh once boasted an Air Force radar station and still houses a state Extension Experiment Station. Near the highway is the site of a state fish hatchery, and nearby, a double humped butte is known locally as "Camelback". Miles City lies at the mouth of the north flowing Tongue River as it empties into the eastward flowing Yellowstone River. Both rivers are fished regularly, but yield mostly catfish, carp and a junk fish known locally as " shiners ". Many local reservoirs are stocked with edible fish from the hatchery in Miles City.

Trinity Lutheran Church [ edit ] There are 21 places of worship in Miles City.

[ 25 ] Trinity Lutheran Church was founded in 1906 [ 26 ] as a preaching station with German services [ 27 ] and served by missionaries following on the newly built Northern Pacific Railroad to hold services for German settlers in Miles City.

[ 28 ] During the anti-German hysteria of WWI, preaching in German was outlawed in Montana, including for worship at Trinity, Miles City.

[ 29 ] Now it is an English-speaking congregation in the Montana District of the Lutheran Church Missouri Synod (LCMS).
