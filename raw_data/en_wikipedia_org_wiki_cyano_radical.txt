 You deserve an explanation 

August 17: An important update for readers in the United States. 

Please don't skip this 1-minute read. It's Sunday, August 17, and we're running a short fundraiser to support Wikipedia. If you've lost count of how many times you've visited Wikipedia this year, we hope that means it's given you at least $2.75 of knowledge. Please join the 2% of readers who give what they can to keep this valuable resource ad-free and available for all.

After nearly 25 years, Wikipedia is still the internet we were promised—created by people, not by machines. It's not perfect, but it's not here to push a point of view. It's owned by a non-profit, not a giant technology company or a billionaire.

Most readers donate because Wikipedia is useful to them, others because Wikipedia is more important than ever. If you feel the same, please donate $2.75 now—or consider a monthly gift to help all year. Thank you.

Chemical compound

The **cyano radical** (or **cyanido radical**) is a [radical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry) "Radical (chemistry)") with molecular formula CN, sometimes written •CN. The cyano radical was one of the first detected molecules in the [interstellar medium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_medium "Interstellar medium"), in 1938. Its detection and analysis was influential in [astrochemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrochemistry "Astrochemistry"). The discovery was confirmed with a [coudé](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflecting_telescope#Coud%C3%A9 "Reflecting telescope")[spectrograph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrograph "Spectrograph"), which was made famous and credible due to this detection. ·CN has been observed in both diffuse clouds and dense clouds.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyano_radical#cite_note-Comparative-1) Usually, CN is detected in regions with [hydrogen cyanide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_cyanide "Hydrogen cyanide"), [hydrogen isocyanide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_isocyanide "Hydrogen isocyanide"), and [HCNH+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HCNH%2B "HCNH+"), since it is involved in the creation and destruction of these species (see also _[Cyanogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanogen "Cyanogen")_).

Physical properties
-------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cyano_radical&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Physical properties")]

Bonding in the cyano radical can be described as a combination of two resonance structures: the structure with the unpaired electron on the carbon is the minor contributor, while the structure with the unpaired electron on the nitrogen (the isocyano radical) is the major contributor. The charge separation in the isocyano radical is similar to that of [carbon monoxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide "Carbon monoxide"). •CN has a [dipole moment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_dipole_moment "Molecular dipole moment") of 1.45[debyes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debye_(unit) "Debye (unit)") and a 2 Σ+ ground electronic state. The [selection rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_rule "Selection rule") are:

N+S=J J+I=F{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}N+S&=J\\J+I&=F\end{aligned}}}![Image 35: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}N+S&=J\\J+I&=F\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/de617544e8e79107fa5ebfe46f1627ad4e70710b)
where _N_ is the [angular momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_momentum "Angular momentum"), _S_ is the electric spin, and I=1 is the nuclear spin of 14 N.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyano_radical#cite_note-2)

Formation and destruction of •CN
--------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cyano_radical&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Formation and destruction of •CN")]

### Formation

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cyano_radical&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Formation")]

*   Dissociative recombination in diffuse clouds:[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyano_radical#cite_note-Comparative-1)HCN+ + e− → •CN + H•
*   Photodissociation in dense clouds:[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyano_radical#cite_note-HD56126-3)HCN + _hν_ → •CN + H•

### Destruction

Detections of •CN
-----------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cyano_radical&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Detections of •CN")]

A spectral line of •CN was detected in 1938 in the [interstellar medium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_medium "Interstellar medium") in the [ultraviolet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet "Ultraviolet"), and was identified in 1940 by [Andrew McKellar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_McKellar "Andrew McKellar"). The [coudé spectrograph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coud%C3%A9_spectrograph "Coudé spectrograph") and a 100-inch (2.5 m) telescope were used to observe •CN's interstellar lines and ultraviolet spectra. Use of the spectrograph confirmed McKellar's findings and also made the spectrograph famous.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyano_radical#cite_note-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyano_radical#cite_note-5) In 1970, •CN's first rotational transition from _J_=0 to _J_=1 was detected In the [Orion Nebula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_Nebula "Orion Nebula") and the [W51](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westerhout_51 "Westerhout 51") nebula.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyano_radical#cite_note-Orion-6) The first detection of •CN in extragalactic sources were seen toward [Sculptor Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sculptor_Galaxy "Sculptor Galaxy") (NGC 253), [IC 342](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IC_342 "IC 342"), and [M82](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_82 "Messier 82") In 1988. These emission lines seen were from _N_=1 to _N_=0 and _N_=2 to _N_=1.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyano_radical#cite_note-7) In 1991, the •CN vibration-rotational bands were observed in a king furnace at the [National Solar Observatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Solar_Observatory "National Solar Observatory") using a McMath Fourier-Transform spectrometer. The observed 2 to 0 lines show an extreme [hyperfine structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperfine_structure "Hyperfine structure").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyano_radical#cite_note-Orion-6) In 1995, the rotational absorption spectrum of ·CN in the ground state was observed in the 1 THz region, and most of the lines were measured in the range of 560 to 1020 GHz. Four new rotational transitions were measured; _N_=8 to _N_=8, _J_=⁠15/2⁠ to _J_=⁠17/2⁠ and _J_=⁠17/2⁠ to _J_=⁠19/2⁠; _N_=7 to _N_=8, _J_=⁠15/2⁠ to _J_=⁠17/2⁠ and _J_=⁠13/2⁠ to _J_=⁠15/2⁠.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyano_radical#cite_note-8)
