An image of the [Sahara Desert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahara "Sahara") from satellite. It is the world's largest hot desert and third-largest desert after the [polar deserts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_desert "Polar desert").

The **natural environment** or **natural world** encompasses all [biotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life "Life") and [abiotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiotic_component "Abiotic component") things occurring [naturally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature "Nature"), meaning in this case not [artificial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificiality "Artificiality"). The term is most often applied to [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth") or some parts of Earth. This environment encompasses the interaction of all living [species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species "Species"), [climate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate "Climate"), weather and natural resources that affect human survival and economic activity.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment#cite_note-1) The concept of the _natural environment_ can be distinguished as components:

*   Complete [ecological units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_unit "Ecological unit") that function as natural systems without massive civilized human intervention, including all vegetation, [microorganisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism "Microorganism"), [soil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil "Soil"), [rocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_(geology) "Rock (geology)"), plateaus, mountains, the [atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth "Atmosphere of Earth") and [natural phenomena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_natural_phenomena "List of natural phenomena") that occur within their boundaries and their nature.
*   Universal [natural resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource "Natural resource") and [physical phenomena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon "Phenomenon") that lack clear-cut boundaries, such as air, water and climate, as well as [energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy "Energy"), [radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation "Radiation"), [electric charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge "Electric charge") and [magnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism "Magnetism"), not originating from civilized human actions.

In contrast to the natural environment is the [built environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Built_environment "Built environment"). Built environments are where humans have fundamentally transformed landscapes such as urban settings and agricultural [land conversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_development "Land development"), the natural environment is greatly changed into a simplified human environment. Even acts which seem less extreme, such as building a mud [hut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hut "Hut") or a [photovoltaic system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photovoltaic_system "Photovoltaic system") in the [desert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert "Desert"), the modified environment becomes an artificial one. Though many animals build things to provide a better environment for themselves, they are not human, hence [beaver dams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaver_dam "Beaver dam") and the works of [mound-building termites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mound-building_termites "Mound-building termites") are thought of as natural.

There are no _absolutely natural_ environments on Earth. Naturalness usually varies in a continuum, from 100% natural in one extreme to 0% natural in the other. The massive environmental changes of humanity in the [Anthropocene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropocene "Anthropocene") have fundamentally affected all natural environments including: [climate change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change "Climate change"), [biodiversity loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity_loss "Biodiversity loss") and [pollution from plastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution_from_plastic "Pollution from plastic") and [other chemicals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution "Pollution") in the [air](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pollution "Air pollution") and [water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_pollution "Water pollution"). More precisely, we can consider the different aspects or components of an environment, and see that their degree of naturalness is not uniform.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment#cite_note-2) If, for instance, we take an agricultural field, and consider the [mineralogic composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineralogy "Mineralogy") and the [structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_structure "Soil structure") of its soil, we will find that whereas the first is quite similar to that of an undisturbed forest soil, the structure is quite different.

[Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth")'s layered structure: (1) inner core; (2) outer core; (3) lower mantle; (4) [upper mantle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_mantle_(Earth) "Upper mantle (Earth)"); (5) lithosphere; (6) crust

Earth science generally recognizes four spheres, the [lithosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithosphere "Lithosphere"), the [hydrosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrosphere "Hydrosphere"), the [atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere "Atmosphere") and the [biosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosphere "Biosphere")[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment#cite_note-wheeling-3) as correspondent to [rocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_(geology) "Rock (geology)"), [water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water "Water"), [air](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air "Air") and [life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life "Life") respectively. Some scientists include as part of the spheres of the Earth, the [cryosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryosphere "Cryosphere") (corresponding to [ice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice "Ice")) as a distinct portion of the hydrosphere, as well as the [pedosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedosphere "Pedosphere") (to [soil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil "Soil")) as an active and intermixed sphere. Earth science (also known as geoscience, the geographical sciences or the Earth Sciences), is an all-embracing term for the [sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science "Science") related to the planet [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_(planet) "Earth (planet)").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment#cite_note-4) There are four major [disciplines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discipline "Discipline") in earth sciences, namely [geography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography "Geography"), [geology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geology "Geology"), [geophysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics "Geophysics") and [geodesy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesy "Geodesy"). These major disciplines use [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics"), [chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry "Chemistry"), [biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology "Biology"), [chronology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronology "Chronology") and [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics") to build a qualitative and quantitative understanding of the principal areas or _[spheres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline\_of\_Earth\_sciences#Earth's\_spheres "Outline of Earth sciences")_ of Earth.

Geological activity
-------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Natural_environment&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Geological activity")]

The [Earth's crust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crust_(geology)#Earth's_crust "Crust (geology)") or [lithosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithosphere "Lithosphere"), is the outermost solid surface of the planet and is chemically, physically and mechanically different from underlying [mantle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantle_(geology) "Mantle (geology)"). It has been generated greatly by [igneous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igneous "Igneous") processes in which [magma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magma "Magma") cools and solidifies to form solid rock. Beneath the lithosphere lies the mantle which is heated by the [decay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay "Radioactive decay") of [radioactive elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_element "Radioactive element"). The mantle though solid is in a state of [rheic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheid "Rheid")[convection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convection "Convection"). This convection process causes the lithospheric plates to move, albeit slowly. The resulting process is known as [plate tectonics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics "Plate tectonics"). [Volcanoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanoes "Volcanoes") result primarily from the melting of [subducted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subduction "Subduction") crust material or of rising mantle at [mid-ocean ridges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-ocean_ridge "Mid-ocean ridge") and [mantle plumes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantle_plume "Mantle plume").

[![Image 4](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/Blue_Linckia_Starfish.JPG/250px-Blue_Linckia_Starfish.JPG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Blue_Linckia_Starfish.JPG)

[Coral reefs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral_reef "Coral reef") have significant marine [biodiversity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity "Biodiversity").

Most water is found in various kinds of natural [body of water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_of_water "Body of water").

An ocean is a major body of [saline water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seawater "Seawater") and a component of the hydrosphere. Approximately 71% of the [surface of the Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_of_the_Earth "Surface of the Earth") (an area of some 362 million square kilometers) is covered by ocean, a [continuous body of water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Ocean "World Ocean") that is customarily divided into several principal oceans and smaller [seas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea "Sea"). More than half of this area is over 3,000 meters (9,800 ft) deep. Average oceanic [salinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salinity "Salinity") is around 35 [parts per thousand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parts_per_thousand "Parts per thousand") (ppt) (3.5%), and nearly all seawater has a salinity in the range of 30 to 38 ppt. Though generally recognized as several separate oceans, these waters comprise one global, interconnected body of salt water often referred to as the [World Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Ocean "World Ocean") or global ocean.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment#cite_note-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment#cite_note-UNAoO-6) The deep [seabeds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seabed "Seabed") are more than half the Earth's surface, and are among the least-modified natural environments. The major oceanic divisions are defined in part by the [continents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continent "Continent"), various [archipelagos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archipelago "Archipelago") and other criteria, these divisions are, in descending order of size, the [Pacific Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean "Pacific Ocean"), the [Atlantic Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean "Atlantic Ocean"), the [Indian Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean "Indian Ocean"), the [Southern Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Ocean "Southern Ocean") and the [Arctic Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_Ocean "Arctic Ocean").

Further information: [Stream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream "Stream")

A river is a natural [watercourse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watercourse "Watercourse"),[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment#cite_note-7) usually [freshwater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freshwater "Freshwater"), flowing toward an [ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean "Ocean"), a [lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake "Lake"), a [sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea "Sea") or another river. A few rivers simply flow into the ground and dry up completely without reaching another body of water.

Rocky [stream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream "Stream") in the U.S. state of [Hawaii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii "Hawaii")

The water in a river is usually in a [channel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_(geography) "Channel (geography)"), made up of a [stream bed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_bed "Stream bed") between [banks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_bank "Stream bank"). In larger rivers there is often also a wider [floodplain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floodplain "Floodplain") shaped by waters over-topping the channel. Flood plains may be very wide in relation to the size of the river channel. Rivers are a part of the [hydrological cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrological_cycle "Hydrological cycle"). Water within a river is generally collected from [precipitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precipitation_(meteorology) "Precipitation (meteorology)") through [surface runoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_runoff "Surface runoff"), [groundwater recharge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundwater_recharge "Groundwater recharge"), [springs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_(hydrosphere) "Spring (hydrosphere)") and the release of water stored in [glaciers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glacier "Glacier") and snowpacks.

Small rivers may also be called by several other names, including [stream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream "Stream"), creek and brook. Their [current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_(stream) "Current (stream)") is confined within a [bed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_bed "Stream bed") and [stream banks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_bank "Stream bank"). Streams play an important [corridor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife_corridor "Wildlife corridor") role in connecting [fragmented habitats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_fragmentation "Habitat fragmentation") and thus in conserving [biodiversity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity "Biodiversity"). The study of streams and waterways in general is known as _surface [hydrology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrology "Hydrology")_.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment#cite_note-8)

A lake (from Latin _lacus_) is a [terrain feature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrain_feature "Terrain feature"), a body of water that is localized to the bottom of [basin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(geology) "Depression (geology)"). A body of water is considered a lake when it is inland, is not part of an [ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean "Ocean") and is larger and deeper than a [pond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pond "Pond").[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment#cite_note-9)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment#cite_note-10)

[![Image 7](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/Everglades_Park_swamp.JPG/250px-Everglades_Park_swamp.JPG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Everglades_Park_swamp.JPG)

Natural lakes on Earth are generally found in [mountainous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain "Mountain") areas, [rift zones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rift_zone "Rift zone") and areas with ongoing or recent [glaciation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glacier "Glacier"). Other lakes are found in [endorheic basins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endorheic_basin "Endorheic basin") or along the courses of mature rivers. In some parts of the world, there are many lakes because of chaotic drainage patterns left over from the [last ice age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Glacial_Period "Last Glacial Period"). All lakes are temporary over geologic time scales, as they will slowly fill in with sediments or spill out of the basin containing them.

Main article: [Pond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pond "Pond")

A pond is a [body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_of_water "Body of water") of [standing water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_stagnation "Water stagnation"), either natural or human-made, that is usually smaller than a [lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake "Lake"). A wide variety of human-made bodies of water are classified as ponds, including [water gardens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_garden "Water garden") designed for aesthetic ornamentation, [fish ponds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_pond "Fish pond") designed for commercial fish breeding and [solar ponds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_pond "Solar pond") designed to store thermal energy. Ponds and lakes are distinguished from streams by their [current speed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_velocity "Flow velocity"). While currents in streams are easily observed, ponds and lakes possess thermally driven micro-currents and moderate wind-driven currents. These features distinguish a pond from many other aquatic terrain features, such as [stream pools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_pool "Stream pool") and [tide pools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tide_pool "Tide pool").

### Human impact on water

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Natural_environment&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Human impact on water")]

Humans impact the water in different ways such as modifying rivers (through [dams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dam "Dam") and [stream channelization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channelization_(rivers) "Channelization (rivers)")), [urbanization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urbanization "Urbanization") and [deforestation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation "Deforestation"). These impact lake levels, groundwater conditions, [water pollution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_pollution "Water pollution"), [thermal pollution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_pollution "Thermal pollution"), and [marine pollution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_pollution "Marine pollution"). Humans modify rivers by using direct channel manipulation.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment#cite_note-Goudie-11) We build dams and reservoirs and manipulate the direction of the rivers and water path. Dams can usefully create reservoirs and hydroelectric power. However, reservoirs and dams may negatively impact the environment and wildlife. Dams stop fish migration and the movement of organisms downstream. Urbanization affects the environment because of deforestation and changing lake levels, groundwater conditions, etc. Deforestation and urbanization go hand in hand. Deforestation may cause flooding, declining stream flow and changes in riverside vegetation. The changing vegetation occurs because when trees cannot get adequate water they start to deteriorate, leading to a decreased food supply for the wildlife in an area.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment#cite_note-Goudie-11)

The atmosphere of the Earth serves as a key factor in sustaining the planetary ecosystem. The thin layer of [gases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas "Gas") that envelops the Earth is held in place by the planet's gravity. Dry [air](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air "Air") consists of 78% [nitrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen "Nitrogen"), 21% [oxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen "Oxygen"), 1% [argon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon "Argon"), [inert gases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inert_gases "Inert gases") and [carbon dioxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide "Carbon dioxide"). The remaining gases are often referred to as trace gases.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment#cite_note-13) The atmosphere includes [greenhouse gases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas "Greenhouse gas") such as carbon dioxide, methane, [nitrous oxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrous_oxide "Nitrous oxide") and ozone. Filtered air includes trace amounts of many other [chemical compounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound "Chemical compound"). Air also contains a variable amount of [water vapor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_vapor "Water vapor") and [suspensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_(chemistry) "Suspension (chemistry)") of water droplets and [ice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice "Ice") crystals seen as [clouds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud "Cloud"). Many natural substances may be present in tiny amounts in an unfiltered air sample, including [dust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust "Dust"), [pollen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollen "Pollen") and [spores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spores "Spores"), [sea spray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_spray "Sea spray"), [volcanic ash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanic_ash "Volcanic ash") and [meteoroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteoroid "Meteoroid"). Various industrial [pollutants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollutant "Pollutant") also may be present, such as [chlorine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorine "Chlorine") (elementary or in [chlorine compounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorine_compounds "Chlorine compounds")), [fluorine compounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorine_compounds "Fluorine compounds"), [elemental mercury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elemental_mercury "Elemental mercury"), and [sulfur compounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfur_compounds "Sulfur compounds") such as [sulfur dioxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfur_dioxide "Sulfur dioxide") (SO 2).

The [ozone layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone_layer "Ozone layer") of the Earth's atmosphere plays an important role in reducing the amount of [ultraviolet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet "Ultraviolet") (UV) radiation that reaches the surface. As [DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA "DNA") is readily damaged by UV light, this serves to protect life at the surface. The atmosphere also retains heat during the night, thereby reducing the daily temperature extremes.

### Layers of the atmosphere

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Natural_environment&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Layers of the atmosphere")]

Earth's atmosphere can be divided into five main layers. These layers are mainly determined by whether temperature increases or decreases with altitude. From highest to lowest, these layers are:

*   [Exosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exosphere "Exosphere"): The outermost layer of Earth's atmosphere extends from the exobase upward, mainly composed of [hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen "Hydrogen") and [helium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium "Helium").
*   [Thermosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermosphere "Thermosphere"): The top of the thermosphere is the bottom of the exosphere, called the [exobase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exobase "Exobase"). Its height varies with solar activity and ranges from about 350–800 km (220–500 mi; 1,150,000–2,620,000 ft). The [International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station "International Space Station") orbits in this layer, between 320 and 380 km (200 and 240 mi). In another way, the thermosphere is Earth's second highest atmospheric layer, extending from approximately 260,000 feet at the mesopause to the thermopause at altitudes ranging from 1,600,000 to 3,300,000 feet.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment#cite_note-14)
*   [Mesosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesosphere "Mesosphere"): The mesosphere extends from the stratopause to 80–85 km (50–53 mi; 262,000–279,000 ft). It is the layer where most [meteors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteor "Meteor") burn up upon entering the atmosphere.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment#cite_note-15)[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment#cite_note-16)
*   [Stratosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratosphere "Stratosphere"): The stratosphere extends from the tropopause to about 51 km (32 mi; 167,000 ft). The [stratopause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratopause "Stratopause"), which is the boundary between the stratosphere and mesosphere, typically is at 50 to 55 km (31 to 34 mi; 164,000 to 180,000 ft).
*   [Troposphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troposphere "Troposphere"): The troposphere begins at the surface and extends to between 7 km (23,000 ft) at the poles and 17 km (56,000 ft) at the equator, with some variation due to weather. The troposphere is mostly heated by transfer of energy from the surface, so on average the lowest part of the troposphere is warmest and temperature decreases with altitude. The [tropopause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropopause "Tropopause") is the boundary between the troposphere and stratosphere.

Other layers
Within the five principal layers determined by temperature there are several layers determined by other properties.

*   The [ozone layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone_layer "Ozone layer") is contained within the stratosphere. It is mainly located in the lower portion of the stratosphere from about 15–35 km (9.3–21.7 mi; 49,000–115,000 ft), though the thickness varies seasonally and geographically. About 90% of the ozone in our atmosphere is contained in the stratosphere.
*   The [ionosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere "Ionosphere"): The part of the atmosphere that is ionized by solar radiation, stretches from 50 to 1,000 km (31 to 621 mi; 160,000 to 3,280,000 ft) and typically overlaps both the exosphere and the thermosphere. It forms the inner edge of the magnetosphere.
*   The [homosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosphere "Homosphere") and [heterosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterosphere "Heterosphere"): The homosphere includes the troposphere, stratosphere and mesosphere. The upper part of the heterosphere is composed almost completely of hydrogen, the lightest element.
*   The [planetary boundary layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_boundary_layer "Planetary boundary layer") is the part of the troposphere that is nearest the Earth's surface and is directly affected by it, mainly through [turbulent diffusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbulence "Turbulence").

#### Effects of global warming

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Natural_environment&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Effects of global warming")]

The retreat of glaciers since 1850 of [Aletsch Glacier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aletsch_Glacier "Aletsch Glacier") in the [Swiss Alps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Alps "Swiss Alps") (situation in 1979, 1991 and 2002), due to [global warming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming "Global warming")

The dangers of [global warming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming "Global warming") are being increasingly studied by a wide global consortium of scientists.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment#cite_note-17) These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential [long-term effects of global warming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_effects_of_global_warming "Long-term effects of global warming") on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how [climate change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change "Climate change") and global warming caused by [anthropogenic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_impact_on_the_environment "Human impact on the environment"), or human-made releases of [greenhouse gases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas "Greenhouse gas"), most notably [carbon dioxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide "Carbon dioxide"), can act interactively and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the [greenhouse effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_effect "Greenhouse effect"), which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment#cite_note-18) This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population. The most recent report from the [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intergovernmental_Panel_on_Climate_Change "Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change") (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment#cite_note-19) Efforts have been increasingly focused on the [mitigation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitigation_of_global_warming "Mitigation of global warming") of greenhouse gases that are causing climatic changes, on [developing adaptative strategies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation_to_global_warming "Adaptation to global warming") to global warming, to assist humans, other animal, and plant species, ecosystems, regions and [nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation "Nation") in adjusting to the [effects of global warming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_global_warming "Effects of global warming"). Some examples of recent collaboration to [address climate change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_mitigation "Climate change mitigation") and global warming include:

[![Image 12](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Aletschgletsjer_Zwitserland.JPG/250px-Aletschgletsjer_Zwitserland.JPG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Aletschgletsjer_Zwitserland.JPG)

Another view of the [Aletsch Glacier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aletsch_Glacier "Aletsch Glacier") in the [Swiss Alps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Alps "Swiss Alps"), which because of [global warming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming "Global warming") has been decreasing

*   The [United Nations Framework Convention Treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Framework_Convention_on_Climate_Change "United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change") and convention on Climate Change, to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would [prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avoiding_dangerous_climate_change "Avoiding dangerous climate change").[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment#cite_note-20)
*   The [Kyoto Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol "Kyoto Protocol"), which is the protocol to the international Framework Convention on Climate Change treaty, again with the objective of reducing greenhouse gases in an effort to prevent anthropogenic climate change.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment#cite_note-21)
*   The [Western Climate Initiative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Climate_Initiative "Western Climate Initiative"), to identify, evaluate, and implement collective and cooperative ways to reduce greenhouse gases in the region, focusing on a market-based [cap-and-trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emissions_trading "Emissions trading") system.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment#cite_note-22)

A significantly profound challenge is to identify the natural environmental dynamics in contrast to environmental changes not within natural variances. A common solution is to adapt a static view neglecting natural variances to exist. Methodologically, this view could be defended when looking at processes which change slowly and short time series, while the problem arrives when fast processes turns essential in the object of the study.

Worldwide [climate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate "Climate") classifications map

[Climate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate "Climate") looks at the statistics of [temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature "Temperature"), [humidity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humidity "Humidity"), [atmospheric pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_pressure "Atmospheric pressure"), [wind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind "Wind"), [rainfall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainfall "Rainfall"), atmospheric particle count and other [meteorological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology "Meteorology") elements in a given region over long periods of time.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment#cite_note-ncei.noaa.gov-23)[Weather](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather "Weather"), on the other hand, is the present condition of these same elements over periods up to two weeks.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment#cite_note-ncei.noaa.gov-23)

Climates can be [classified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_classification "Climate classification") according to the average and typical ranges of different variables, most commonly temperature and precipitation. The most commonly used classification scheme is the one originally developed by [Wladimir Köppen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wladimir_K%C3%B6ppen "Wladimir Köppen"). The [Thornthwaite system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thornthwaite_climate_classification "Thornthwaite climate classification"),[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment#cite_note-24) in use since 1948, uses [evapotranspiration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evapotranspiration "Evapotranspiration") as well as temperature and precipitation information to study animal species diversity and the potential impacts of [climate changes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change "Climate change").[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment#cite_note-25)

[![Image 14](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/Rainbow_over_Bristol.jpg/250px-Rainbow_over_Bristol.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Rainbow_over_Bristol.jpg)

A [rainbow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow "Rainbow") is an [optical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics "Optics") and [meteorological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology "Meteorology") phenomenon that causes a [spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_spectrum "Optical spectrum") of [light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light "Light") to appear in the sky when the Sun shines onto droplets of moisture in the [Earth's atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_atmosphere "Earth's atmosphere").

[Weather](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather "Weather") is a set of all the [phenomena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomena "Phenomena") occurring in a given [atmospheric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric "Atmospheric") area at a given [time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time "Time").[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment#cite_note-26) Most weather phenomena occur in the [troposphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troposphere "Troposphere"),[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment#cite_note-27)[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment#cite_note-trop-28) just below the [stratosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratosphere "Stratosphere"). _Weather_ refers, generally, to day-to-day temperature and precipitation activity, whereas _[climate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate "Climate")_ is the term for the average atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment#cite_note-29) When used without qualification, _weather_ is understood to be the weather of Earth.

Weather occurs due to density (temperature and moisture) differences between one place and another. These differences can occur due to the sun angle at any particular spot, which varies by latitude from the tropics. The strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the [jet stream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_stream "Jet stream"). Weather systems in the [mid-latitudes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-latitudes "Mid-latitudes"), such as [extratropical cyclones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extratropical_cyclone "Extratropical cyclone"), are caused by instabilities of the jet stream flow. Because the Earth's [axis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_rotation "Earth's rotation") is tilted relative to its orbital plane, [sunlight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunlight "Sunlight") is incident at different angles at different times of the year. On the Earth's surface, temperatures usually range ±40°C (100°F to −40°F) annually. Over thousands of years, changes in the Earth's orbit have affected the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the Earth and influenced long-term climate.

Surface [temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature "Temperature") differences in turn cause pressure differences. Higher altitudes are cooler than lower altitudes due to differences in [compressional heating](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Compressional_heating&action=edit&redlink=1 "Compressional heating (page does not exist)"). [Weather forecasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_forecasting "Weather forecasting") is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the atmosphere for a future time and a given location. The atmosphere is a [chaotic system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaotic_system "Chaotic system"), and small changes to one part of the system can grow to have large effects on the system as a whole. Human attempts to [control the weather](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_the_weather "Control the weather") have occurred throughout human history, and there is evidence that civilized human activity such as [agriculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture "Agriculture") and [industry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_society "Industrial society") has inadvertently modified weather patterns.

[![Image 15](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/Diversity_of_plants_%28Streptophyta%29_version_2.png/250px-Diversity_of_plants_%28Streptophyta%29_version_2.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Diversity_of_plants_(Streptophyta)_version_2.png)

[![Image 16](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/Animal_diversity.png/250px-Animal_diversity.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Animal_diversity.png)

Evidence suggests that [life on Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life "Life") has existed for about 3.7 [billion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1000000000_(number) "1000000000 (number)") years.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment#cite_note-30) All known life forms share fundamental molecular mechanisms, and based on these observations, theories on the [origin of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_of_life "Origin of life") attempt to find a mechanism explaining the formation of a primordial single cell organism from which all life originates. There are many different hypotheses regarding the path that might have been taken from simple [organic molecules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_molecule "Organic molecule") via pre-cellular life to protocells and metabolism.

Although there is no universal agreement on the definition of life, scientists generally accept that the biological manifestation of life is characterized by [organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism "Organism"), [metabolism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism "Metabolism"), [growth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth "Cell growth"), [adaptation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation "Adaptation"), response to [stimuli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(physiology) "Stimulus (physiology)") and [reproduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction "Reproduction").[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment#cite_note-31) Life may also be said to be simply the characteristic state of [organisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism "Organism"). In [biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology "Biology"), the science of living organisms, "life" is the condition which distinguishes active [organisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism "Organism") from [inorganic matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inorganic_compound "Inorganic compound"), including the capacity for growth, [functional activity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology "Physiology") and the continual change preceding death.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment#cite_note-ReferenceA-32)[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment#cite_note-Merriam-Webster_Dictionary-33)

A diverse variety of living organisms (life forms) can be found in the [biosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosphere "Biosphere") on Earth, and properties common to these organisms—plants, [animals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal "Animal"), [fungi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus "Fungus"), [protists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist "Protist"), [archaea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaea "Archaea"), and [bacteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria "Bacteria")—are a [carbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon-based_life "Carbon-based life")- and water-based [cellular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology) "Cell (biology)") form with complex [organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization "Organization") and heritable [genetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene "Gene") information. Living organisms undergo [metabolism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism "Metabolism"), maintain [homeostasis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis "Homeostasis"), possess a capacity to [grow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth "Cell growth"), respond to [stimuli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(physiology) "Stimulus (physiology)"), [reproduce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduce "Reproduce") and, through [natural selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection "Natural selection"), adapt to their environment in successive generations. More complex living organisms can communicate through various means.

[Rainforests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainforest "Rainforest") often have a great deal of [biodiversity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity "Biodiversity") with many plant and animal species. This is the [Gambia River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambia_River "Gambia River") in [Senegal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senegal "Senegal")'s [Niokolo-Koba National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niokolo-Koba_National_Park "Niokolo-Koba National Park").

An [ecosystem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem "Ecosystem") (also called an environment) is a natural unit consisting of all plants, animals, and micro-organisms ([biotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biotic_component "Biotic component") factors) in an area functioning together with all of the non-living physical ([abiotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiotic "Abiotic")) factors of the environment.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment#cite_note-34)

Central to the ecosystem concept is the idea that [living organisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_organism "Living organism") are continually engaged in a highly interrelated set of relationships with every other element constituting the [environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_(biophysical) "Environment (biophysical)") in which they exist. [Eugene Odum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Odum "Eugene Odum"), one of the founders of the science of [ecology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecology "Ecology"), stated: "Any unit that includes all of the organisms (i.e.: the "community") in a given area interacting with the physical environment so that a flow of energy leads to clearly defined trophic structure, biotic diversity, and material cycles (i.e.: exchange of materials between living and nonliving parts) within the system is an ecosystem."[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment#cite_note-35)

[![Image 18](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/Creek_and_old-growth_forest-Larch_Mountain.jpg/250px-Creek_and_old-growth_forest-Larch_Mountain.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Creek_and_old-growth_forest-Larch_Mountain.jpg)

[Old-growth forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old-growth_forest "Old-growth forest") and a [creek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creek_(tidal) "Creek (tidal)") on [Larch Mountain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larch_Mountain_(Multnomah_County,_Oregon) "Larch Mountain (Multnomah County, Oregon)"), in the U.S. state of [Oregon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon "Oregon")

The human ecosystem concept is then grounded in the deconstruction of the human/nature [dichotomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dichotomy "Dichotomy"), and the emergent premise that all species are ecologically integrated with each other, as well as with the abiotic constituents of their [biotope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biotope "Biotope").

A more significant number or variety of species or [biological diversity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity "Biodiversity") of an ecosystem may contribute to greater resilience of an ecosystem because there are more species present at a location to respond to change and thus "absorb" or reduce its effects. This reduces the effect before the ecosystem's structure changes to a different state. This is not universally the case and there is no proven relationship between the species diversity of an ecosystem and its ability to provide goods and services on a sustainable level.

The term _ecosystem_ can also pertain to human-made environments, such as [human ecosystems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_ecosystem "Human ecosystem") and human-influenced ecosystems. It can describe any situation where there is relationship between living organisms and their environment. Fewer areas on the surface of the earth today exist free from human contact, although some genuine [wilderness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilderness "Wilderness") areas continue to exist without any forms of human intervention.

Biogeochemical cycles

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Natural_environment&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Biogeochemical cycles")]

[Chloroplasts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloroplast "Chloroplast") conduct [photosynthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynthesis "Photosynthesis") and are found in [plant cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_cell "Plant cell") and other [eukaryotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eukaryote "Eukaryote") organisms. These are chloroplasts visible in the cells of _Plagiomnium affine_ — many-fruited thyme-moss.

Global [biogeochemical cycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biogeochemical_cycle "Biogeochemical cycle") are critical to life, most notably those of [water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water "Water"), [oxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen "Oxygen"), [carbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon "Carbon"), [nitrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen "Nitrogen") and [phosphorus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorus "Phosphorus").[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment#cite_note-36)

*   The [nitrogen cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_cycle "Nitrogen cycle") is the transformation of nitrogen and nitrogen-containing compounds in nature. It is a cycle which includes gaseous components.
*   The [water cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_cycle "Water cycle"), is the continuous movement of water on, above, and below the surface of the Earth. Water can change states among liquid, vapour, and ice at various places in the water cycle. Although the balance of water on Earth remains fairly constant over time, individual water molecules can come and go.
*   The [carbon cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_cycle "Carbon cycle") is the biogeochemical cycle by which carbon is exchanged among the biosphere, pedosphere, geosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere of the Earth.
*   The [oxygen cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_cycle "Oxygen cycle") is the movement of oxygen within and between its three main reservoirs: the atmosphere, the biosphere, and the [lithosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithosphere "Lithosphere"). The main driving factor of the oxygen cycle is [photosynthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynthesis "Photosynthesis"), which is responsible for the modern Earth's atmospheric composition and life.
*   The [phosphorus cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorus_cycle "Phosphorus cycle") is the movement of phosphorus through the lithosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere. The atmosphere does not play a significant role in the movements of phosphorus, because phosphorus and phosphorus compounds are usually solids at the typical ranges of temperature and pressure found on Earth.

[Wilderness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilderness "Wilderness") is generally defined as a natural environment on Earth that has not been significantly modified by [human](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human "Human") activity. The [WILD Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WILD_Foundation "WILD Foundation") goes into more detail, defining wilderness as: "The most intact, undisturbed wild natural areas left on our planet – those last truly wild places that humans do not control and have not developed with roads, pipelines or other industrial infrastructure."[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment#cite_note-37) Wilderness areas and protected [parks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parks "Parks") are considered important for the survival of certain [species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species "Species"), ecological studies, [conservation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_conservation "Habitat conservation"), solitude, and [recreation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreation "Recreation"). Wilderness is deeply valued for cultural, spiritual, [moral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral "Moral"), and [aesthetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetic "Aesthetic") reasons. Some nature writers believe wilderness areas are vital for the human spirit and creativity.[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment#cite_note-38)

The word, "wilderness", derives from the notion of [wildness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildness "Wildness"); in other words that which is not controllable by humans. The word [etymology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etymology "Etymology") is from the [Old English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English "Old English")_wildeornes_, which in turn derives from _wildeor_ meaning _wild beast_ (wild + deor = beast, deer).[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment#cite_note-39) From this point of view, it is the wildness of a place that makes it a wilderness. The mere presence or activity of people does not disqualify an area from being "wilderness". Many ecosystems that are, or have been, inhabited or influenced by activities of people may still be considered "wild". This way of looking at wilderness includes areas within which natural processes operate without very noticeable human interference.

[Wildlife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife "Wildlife") includes all non-[domesticated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domesticated "Domesticated") plants, animals and other organisms. Domesticating wild plant and animal species for human benefit has occurred many times all over the planet, and has a major impact on the environment, both positive and negative. Wildlife can be found in all ecosystems. Deserts, rain forests, plains, and other areas—including the most developed [urban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area "Urban area") sites—all have distinct forms of wildlife. While the term in popular culture usually refers to animals that are untouched by civilized human factors, most scientists agree that wildlife around the world is (now) impacted by human activities.

[Amazon rainforest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_rainforest "Amazon rainforest") in [Brazil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil "Brazil"). The tropical rainforests of South America contain the largest diversity of species on Earth, including some that have evolved within the past few hundred thousand years.[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment#cite_note-40)[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment#cite_note-41)

It is the common understanding of _natural environment_ that underlies [environmentalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmentalism "Environmentalism")—a broad [political](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics "Politics"), [social](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociology "Sociology") and [philosophical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy "Philosophy") movement that advocates various actions and policies in the interest of protecting what nature remains in the natural environment, or restoring or expanding the role of nature in this environment. While true wilderness is increasingly rare, _wild_ nature (e.g., unmanaged [forests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forests "Forests"), uncultivated [grasslands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grasslands "Grasslands"), [wildlife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife "Wildlife"), [wildflowers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildflower "Wildflower")) can be found in many locations previously inhabited by humans.

Goals for the benefit of people and natural systems, commonly expressed by [environmental scientists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_scientist "Environmental scientist") and [environmentalists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmentalist "Environmentalist") include:

*   Elimination of [pollution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution "Pollution") and [toxicants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicant "Toxicant") in air, water, soil, buildings, manufactured goods, and food.
*   Preservation of [biodiversity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity "Biodiversity") and protection of [endangered species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_species "Endangered species").
*   [Conservation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_movement "Conservation movement") and [sustainable use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_use "Sustainable use") of resources such as [water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water "Water"),[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment#cite_note-42) land, air, energy, raw materials, and natural resources.
*   Halting human-induced [global warming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming "Global warming"), which represents pollution, a threat to biodiversity, and a threat to human populations.
*   Shifting from [fossil fuels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuels "Fossil fuels") to [renewable energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy "Renewable energy") in electricity, heating and cooling, and transportation, which addresses pollution, global warming, and sustainability. This may include [public transportation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_transportation "Public transportation") and [distributed generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_generation "Distributed generation"), which have benefits for traffic congestion and electric reliability.
*   Shifting from meat-intensive diets to largely [plant-based diets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant-based_diets "Plant-based diets") in order to help mitigate [biodiversity loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity_loss "Biodiversity loss") and climate change.[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment#cite_note-43)
*   Establishment of [nature reserves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_reserve "Nature reserve") for recreational purposes and ecosystem preservation.
*   Sustainable and less polluting [waste management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste_management "Waste management") including [waste reduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste_reduction "Waste reduction") (or even [zero waste](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_waste "Zero waste")), [reuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuse "Reuse"), [recycling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recycling "Recycling"), [composting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composting "Composting"), [waste-to-energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste-to-energy "Waste-to-energy"), and [anaerobic digestion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaerobic_digestion "Anaerobic digestion") of sewage sludge.
*   Reducing [profligate consumption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overconsumption "Overconsumption") and clamping down on [illegal fishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal,_unreported_and_unregulated_fishing "Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing") and [logging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_logging "Illegal logging").[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment#cite_note-44)
*   Slowing and stabilisation of [human population growth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_population_growth "Human population growth").[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment#cite_note-45)
*   Reducing the import of second hand electronic appliances from developed countries to developing countries.[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment#cite_note-46)[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment#cite_note-47)

In some cultures the term environment is meaningless because there is no separation between people and what they view as the natural world, or their surroundings.[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment#cite_note-48) Specifically in the United States and Arabian countries many native cultures do not recognize the "environment", or see themselves as environmentalists.[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment#cite_note-49)

[a Lake is] any relatively large body of slowly moving or standing water that occupies an inland basin of appreciable size. Definitions that precisely distinguish lakes, ponds, swamps, and even rivers and other bodies of nonoceanic water are not established. It may be said, however, that rivers and streams are relatively fast-moving; marshes and swamps contain relatively large quantities of grasses, trees, or shrubs; and ponds are relatively small in comparison to lakes. Geologically defined, lakes are temporary bodies of water.
