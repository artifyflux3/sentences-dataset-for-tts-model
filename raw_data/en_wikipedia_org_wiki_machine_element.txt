These elements consist of three basic types: structural components such as frame members, bearings , axles , splines , fasteners , seals , and lubricants , mechanisms that control movement in various ways such as gear trains , belt or chain drives , linkages , cam and follower systems, including brakes and clutches , and control components such as buttons, switches, indicators, sensors, actuators and computer controllers.

[ 1 ] While generally not considered to be a machine element, the shape, texture and color of covers are an important part of a machine that provide a styling and operational interface between the mechanical components of a machine and its users.

Machine elements are basic mechanical parts and features used as the building blocks of most machines .

[ 2 ] Most are standardized to common sizes, but customs are also common for specialized applications.

[ 3 ] Machine elements may be features of a part (such as screw threads or integral plain bearings) or they may be discrete parts in and of themselves such as wheels, axles, pulleys, rolling-element bearings , or gears. All of the simple machines may be described as machine elements, and many machine elements incorporate concepts of one or more simple machines.  For example, a leadscrew incorporates a screw thread , which is an inclined plane wrapped around a cylinder .

Many mechanical design, invention, and engineering tasks involve a knowledge of various machine elements and an intelligent and creative combining of these elements into a component or assembly that fills a need (serves an application).
