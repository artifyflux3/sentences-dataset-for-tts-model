Baars (born 1946, Amsterdam , Netherlands) is a cognitive neuroscientist and former senior fellow in theoretical neurobiology at the Neurosciences Institute in San Diego , California. He is currently an affiliated fellow at the institute.

[ citation needed ] He is best known as the originator of global workspace theory , a concept of human cognitive architecture and consciousness .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] He previously served as a professor of psychology at Stony Brook University , where he conducted research into the causation of human errors and the Freudian slip , [ 3 ] and as a faculty member at the Wright Institute .

[ 4 ] Baars co-founded the Association for the Scientific Study of Consciousness [ 5 ] and the Academic Press journal Consciousness and Cognition , which he also edited, with William P. Banks, for "more than fifteen years".

[ 6 ] In addition to research on global workspace theory with Stan Franklin and others, [ 7 ] Baars has done work to reintroduce the topic of the conscious brain into the standard college and graduate school curriculum, by writing college textbooks and general-audience books, web teaching, advanced seminars, and course videos.
