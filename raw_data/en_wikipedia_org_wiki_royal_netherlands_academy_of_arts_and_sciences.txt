KNAW ) is an organization dedicated to the advancement of science and literature in the Netherlands . The academy is housed in the Trippenhuis in Amsterdam .

In addition to various advisory and administrative functions it operates a number of research institutes and awards many prizes, including the Lorentz Medal in theoretical physics, the Dr Hendrik Muller Prize for Behavioural and Social Science and the Heineken Prizes .

Main functions [ edit ] The academy advises the Dutch government on scientific matters. While its advice often pertains to genuine scientific concerns, it also counsels the government on such topics as policy on careers for researchers or the Netherlands' contribution to major international projects. The academy offers solicited and unsolicited advice to parliament, ministries, universities and research institutes, funding agencies and international organizations.

Advising the government on matters related to scientific research Providing a forum for the scientific world and promoting international scientific cooperation Acting as an umbrella organization for the institutes primarily engaged in basic and strategic scientific research and disseminating information Members and organization [ edit ] A list of members can be found at Members of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences .

The members are appointed for life by co-optation . Nominations for candidate membership by persons or organizations outside the academy are accepted. The acceptance criterion is delivered scientific achievements. Academy membership is therefore regarded as a great honor, and prestigious. Besides regular members, there are foreign members and corresponding members. Since a new membership system was introduced in 2011 there will be no new corresponding members. Each year a maximum of sixteen members are appointed to the academy.

[ 4 ] The Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences has long embraced the entire field of learning. The Royal Academy comprises two departments, consisting of around 500 members: [ 4 ] Science (mathematics, physics, astronomy , life sciences, and engineering sciences) Humanities and Social Sciences (humanities, law, behavioural sciences and social sciences) Both departments have their own board. The departments, in turn, are divided into sections. The highest organ in the academy is the general meeting of members, the united meeting of both departments. The president was Frits van Oostrom until 1 May 2008, after which he was succeeded by Robbert Dijkgraaf . Both van Oostrom in his leaving address and Dijkgraaf in his inaugural address have voiced their worries about the low level of funding in science in the Netherlands compared to almost all other western countries. A list of presidents of the academy is as follows: [ 5 ] 1973–1978 Hendrik Casimir 1978–1981 Samuel Dresden 1981–1984 André Donner 1984–1990 David de Wied 1990–1996 Pieter Drenth 1996–1999 Pieter Zandbergen 1999–2002 Robert S.

In 1816, after the occupation had ended, it was renamed to Koninklijk-Nederlandsch Instituut van Wetenschappen, Letteren en Schoone Kunsten . In 1851, it was disbanded and re-established as the Koninklijke Akademie van Wetenschappen and in 1938 obtained its present name. Since 1812, the academy has resided in the Trippenhuis in Amsterdam.

The institute was awarded the Gouden Ganzenveer in 1955.

Ten members are elected each year for a term of five years; members are scientists between 25 and 45 years old and are selected for a record of excellence in their research. It was modelled after the similar German Junge Akademie and both of these academies in turn were used as models for the Global Young Academy .

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] Society of Arts [ edit ] The Society of Arts (Akademie van Kunsten) is a society of prominent artists from various disciplines, including architecture, visual arts, dance, film, photography, literature, music and performing arts. Its aim is to be the place "for debate about the value of art in society and about the relationship between art and science".The Society of Arts was established by the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2014. Both are seated in the 17th century Trippenhuis in Amsterdam.
