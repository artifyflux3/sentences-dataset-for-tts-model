It is a division of the Department of Clinical Neurosciences of the University of Cambridge .

The Centre opened in 1996 with a GE PET scanner , followed soon after by a Bruker 3T MRI system. After a major programme of infrastructure investment and redevelopment, funded by the Medical Research Council and the University of Cambridge. The facilities now comprise a Siemens 7T Terra MRI scanner, a Siemens 3T PrismaFit scanner, a Siemens 3T SkyraFit scanner, a GE 3T PET/MR Signa scanner and a hyper-polariser system.

[ 1 ] Research conducted within the Centre falls broadly into the categorisations of positron emission tomography , magnetic resonance and radiochemistry .

[ 2 ] It also provides research platforms for neuroscience themes, including dementia, stroke and neurosurgery as well as cognitive neuroscience.
