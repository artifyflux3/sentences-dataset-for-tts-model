Convexity radius at a point p {\textstyle p} of a Riemannian manifold is the supremum of radii of balls centered at p {\textstyle p} that are (totally) convex . The convexity radius of the manifold is the infimum of the convexity radii at its points; for a compact manifold this is a positive number.

The injectivity radius of a Riemannian manifold is the infimum of the injectivity radii at all points.

[ 5 ] See also cut locus .

For complete manifolds, if the injectivity radius at p is a finite number r , then either there is a geodesic of length 2 r which starts and ends at p or there is a point q conjugate to p (see conjugate point above) and on the distance r from p .

[ 6 ] For a closed Riemannian manifold the injectivity radius is either half the minimal length of a closed geodesic or the minimal distance between conjugate points on a geodesic.

[ 15 ] Quasigeodesic has two meanings; here we give the most common. A map f : I → → Y {\displaystyle f:I\to Y} (where I ⊆ ⊆ R {\displaystyle I\subseteq \mathbb {R} } is a subinterval) is called a quasigeodesic if there are constants K ≥ ≥ 1 {\displaystyle K\geq 1} and C ≥ ≥ 0 {\displaystyle C\geq 0} such that for every x , y ∈ ∈ I {\displaystyle x,y\in I} 1 K d ( x , y ) − − C ≤ ≤ d ( f ( x ) , f ( y ) ) ≤ ≤ K d ( x , y ) + C .

{\displaystyle {1 \over K}d(x,y)-C\leq d(f(x),f(y))\leq Kd(x,y)+C.} Note that a quasigeodesic is not necessarily a continuous curve.

Quasi-isometry .

A map f : X → → Y {\displaystyle f:X\to Y} is called a quasi-isometry if there are constants K ≥ ≥ 1 {\displaystyle K\geq 1} and C ≥ ≥ 0 {\displaystyle C\geq 0} such that 1 K d ( x , y ) − − C ≤ ≤ d ( f ( x ) , f ( y ) ) ≤ ≤ K d ( x , y ) + C .

{\displaystyle {1 \over K}d(x,y)-C\leq d(f(x),f(y))\leq Kd(x,y)+C.} and every point in Y has distance at most C from some point of f ( X ). Note that a quasi-isometry is not assumed to be continuous. For example, any map between compact metric spaces is a quasi isometry. If there exists a quasi-isometry from X to Y, then X and Y are said to be quasi-isometric .

Riemannian submersion is a map between Riemannian manifolds which is submersion and submetry at the same time.

S [ edit ] Scalar curvature Second fundamental form is a quadratic form on the tangent space of hypersurface, usually denoted by II, an equivalent way to describe the shape operator of a hypersurface, II ( v , w ) = ⟨ ⟨ S ( v ) , w ⟩ ⟩ .

{\displaystyle {\text{II}}(v,w)=\langle S(v),w\rangle .} It can be also generalized to arbitrary codimension, in which case it is a quadratic form with values in the normal space.

Sectional curvature at a point p {\textstyle p} of a Riemannian manifold M {\textstyle M} along the 2-plane spanned by two linearly independent vectors u , v ∈ ∈ T p M {\textstyle u,v\in T_{p}M} is the number σ σ p ( V e c t ( u , v ) ) = R p ( u , v , v , u ) g p ( u , u ) g p ( v , v ) − − g p ( u , v ) 2 {\displaystyle \sigma _{p}({Vect}(u,v))={\frac {R_{p}(u,v,v,u)}{g_{p}(u,u)g_{p}(v,v)-g_{p}(u,v)^{2}}}} where R p {\textstyle R_{p}} is the curvature tensor written as R p ( X , Y , Z ) W = g p ( ∇ ∇ X ∇ ∇ Y Z − − ∇ ∇ Y ∇ ∇ X Z − − ∇ ∇ [ X , Y ] Z , W ) {\textstyle R_{p}(X,Y,Z)W={g_{p}({\nabla _{X}\nabla _{Y}Z-\nabla _{Y}\nabla _{X}Z-\nabla _{[X,Y]}Z,W})}} , and g p {\textstyle {g_{p}}} is the Riemannian metric.

Shape operator for a hypersurface M is a linear operator on tangent spaces, S p : T p M → T p M . If n is a unit normal field to M and v is a tangent vector then S ( v ) = ± ± ∇ ∇ v n {\displaystyle S(v)=\pm \nabla _{v}n} (there is no standard agreement whether to use + or − in the definition).

Short map is a distance non increasing map.

Smooth manifold Sol manifold is a factor of a connected solvable Lie group by a lattice .

Spherical geometry Submetry A short map f between metric spaces is called a submetry [ 18 ] if there exists R > 0 such that for any point x and radius r < R the image of metric r -ball is an r -ball, i.e.

f ( B r ( x ) ) = B r ( f ( x ) ) .

{\displaystyle f(B_{r}(x))=B_{r}(f(x)).} Sub-Riemannian manifold Symmetric space Riemannian symmetric spaces are Riemannian manifolds in which the geodesic reflection at any point is an isometry. They turn out to be quotients of a real Lie group by a maximal compact subgroup whose Lie algebra is the fixed subalgebra of the involution obtained by differentiating the geodesic symmetry. This algebraic data is enough to provide a classification of the Riemannian symmetric spaces.

Systole The k -systole of M , s y s t k ( M ) {\textstyle syst_{k}(M)} , is the minimal volume of k -cycle nonhomologous to zero.
