The population was 17,075 at the 2020 census . It lies to the south of Portsmouth and to the north of Newport on Aquidneck Island , hence the name "Middletown." History [ edit ] Issues including unjust taxation and a growing population caused the freeholders living in the northern section of Newport to petition the General Assembly for independence. As a result of the petition, the land that Middletown occupies was set apart in 1731. The town was incorporated in 1743.

[ 3 ] During the 1980s, large sections of East Main Road and West Main Road running through Middletown began to be commercialized, and by the late 1990s, the area had become Aquidneck Island's central business district.

Today, the community boasts a strong business district that relies heavily on Naval Station Newport and defense 
industries.

Middletown also maintains its "small-town charm" with scenic vistas of the Atlantic Ocean, world-class beaches, hiking trails and open spaces.

Geography [ edit ] According to the United States Census Bureau , the town has a total area of 14.9 square miles (38.7 km 2 ), of which 13.0 square miles (33.6 km 2 ) is land and 2.0 square miles (5.1 km 2 ; 13.18%) is water. Middletown was known as the "farming community" of Aquidneck Island. Today most of the developed land is located towards the western part of the town, while what is left of its rural heritage is primarily towards the east. Middletown also has several beaches.

The census-designated place of Newport East and part of the Melville CDP lie within the town boundaries.
