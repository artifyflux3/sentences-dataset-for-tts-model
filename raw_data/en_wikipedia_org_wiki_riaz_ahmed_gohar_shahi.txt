( November 2018 ) Riaz Ahmed Gohar Shahi ریاض احمد گوہر شاہی Gohar Shahi during an event held in Pakistan Born ( 1941-11-25 ) 25 November 1941 Dhok Gohar Shah , Rawalpindi , British India (now Pakistan ) Disappeared 2001 Organization Messiah Foundation International Riaz Ahmed Gohar Shahi ( Urdu : ریاض احمد گوھر شاہی ) (born 25 November 1941) was a spiritual leader and founder of the spiritual groups RAGS International (now known as Messiah Foundation International ) [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] and Anjuman Serfaroshan-e-Islam .

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] He is the author of a number of Urdu books on topics relating to spirituality, the most successful among these being Deen-e-Ilahi "The Religion of God" (2000), which was republished by Balboa Press, a division of Hay House and translated into English and other languages by Messiah Foundation International in 2012.

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] RAGS International was renamed to Messiah Foundation International in 2000.

[ 6 ] MFI reports that Shahi claimed to be the Mahdi , Messiah , and Kalki Avatar .

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] Shahi disappeared from public view in 2001. There have been claims that he died in that year or in 2003, but these are unconfirmed.

Biography [ edit ] Early life [ edit ] Shahi was born on 25 November 1941 in the village of Dhok Gohar Shah in the district of Rawalpindi of British India . He is a fifth generation descendant of the Sufi Baba Gohar Ali Shah.

At the age of twenty, when he was the owner of F.Q. Steel Industries, Shahi began to search for spirituality . Eventually he became disillusioned in this search and returned to work. Shahi then married and had three children.

[ 12 ] In 1975, he went to Sehwan for self-mortification; he spent a period of three years in the mountains of Sehwan Sharif and the forest of Laal Bagh in self-purification, "for the sake of God's love".

[ 13 ] Career as spiritual leader [ edit ] Messiah Foundation International Formation 1980 Type Non-profit organisation Headquarters London , United Kingdom Official language Urdu & English Co-Founder Younus AlGohar Website http://www.goharshahi.us/ Main article: Messiah Foundation International Shahi became popular as a Sufi preacher in Pakistan during the late 1970s. He formed RAGS International and Anjuman Serfaroshan-e-Islam in 1980.

[ 14 ] Of the two organisations, RAGS International is still active as Messiah Foundation International whereas Anjuman Serfaroshan-e-Islam was reported to have been dissolved and banned in Pakistan in 2011.

[ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] Shahi at an event at Imam Bargah-e-Noor-e-Iman Mosque, in Karachi , Pakistan. He is seen here speaking to two religious clerics from different sects within Islam: Shia Islam and Sunni Islam .

The CEO of Messiah Foundation International is Younus AlGohar . Shahi claimed to have met with Jesus Christ in 1997.

[ 18 ] Lebanese American mystic of the Naqshbandi Haqqani Sufi Order , Shaykh Hisham Kabbani was once said to have met him upon his invitation.

[ 19 ] However, it has since been clarified that Shahi requested a visit with Shaykh Hisham Kabbani at his home in California. Shaykh Hisham did not know about him at the time, and in the tradition of Muslim hospitality, invited him into his home with a warm welcome. However, it is false that Shaykh Hisham took Bay'ah or from him.

[ 20 ] Some singers such as Aziz Mian and Rahat Fateh Ali Khan have performed at Shahi related events.

[ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ] Legal persecution and exile [ edit ] He and many of his followers [ 24 ] have been convicted under Islamic blasphemy laws [ 25 ] by an antiterrorist court in Sindh .

[ 26 ] After he fled to England , Shahi was convicted in absentia , [ 24 ] [ 26 ] receiving sentences that totaled approximately 59 years.

[ 25 ] Disappearance [ edit ] Shahi was reported to have disappeared in 2001, in London ; afterwards, sightings of him were reported around the world of people claiming to have met and received spiritual guidance from him.

[ 27 ] In February 2002, prior to any decision on appeals filed with the High Court of Sindh , Ardeshir Cowasjee claimed in an article he wrote for the Pakistani newspaper Dawn , that unnamed people who identified themselves to him as office-bearers of the All-Faith Spiritual Movement told him that Gohar Shahi died abroad, but this report was unconfirmed.

[ 25 ] There have been rumours of him dying, with some sources reporting that he died in 2001 and others saying he died in 2003. According to the Pakistani Press Foundation Shahi died in 2001.

[ 9 ] An article from 2006 in the Sunday Telegraph reports that Shahi died in 2003, [ 9 ] and a 2009 article in Your Local Guardian also says that he was reported to have died in 2003.

[ 28 ] However, none of these reports have been confirmed, as there is no body.

On the other hand, the Indian news agency PTI reported in 2008 that Shahi was based in the United Kingdom after being convicted of blasphemy by the High Court of Sindh.

[ 9 ] This view is supported by the Indian Express which reported in 2008 that Shahi had fled to the United Kingdom and was presently based there.

[ 29 ] Zee News also supported this claim.

[ 14 ] The Hindustan Times has reported that he is "serving a life term".

[ 30 ] The Sunday Leader in Sri Lanka stated that Shahi disappeared in 2001 and sightings of him were thereafter reported around the world.

[ 27 ] Of the two factions of Shahi's followers, the Anjuman Serfaroshan-e-Islam had asserted that Shahi died, and built a tomb for him at the Markazi Aastana in Kotri , where devotees performed pilgrimage .

[ 25 ] The MFI, in contrast, declares that he merely disappeared.

[ 28 ] Shahi's family, including his wife, five sons and a daughter, still resides in Kotri.

Claims and criticism [ edit ] Pakistani followers of Shahi burning passports during a protest in India during April, 2007.

The teachings of Gohar Shahi have been a source of controversy. Many mainstream Muslim scholars have condemned his teachings as blasphemy.[30] Claims made by Shahi and his followers have been strongly opposed by orthodox Islamic theologians in Pakistan and abroad.

[ 25 ] Shahi has been accused of claiming the status of a prophet .

[ 4 ] [ 25 ] His teachings have been condemned by Muslim religious leaders and the Pakistani government.

[ 31 ] [ 32 ] Shahi also predicts that the world would end in the year 2026 due to a comet heading towards earth.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] He claims the comet will be the cause of "total destruction" though mentions that "in order to intimidate [mankind]… God plans destruction on a small scale".

[ 33 ] Many attempts were made on the lives of Shahi and Younus AlGohar including a petrol bomb thrown into AlGohar's residence in Manchester , where Shahi stayed when he toured the United Kingdom .

[ 34 ] [ 35 ] A man attempted to attack him with a hand grenade during a discourse at his home in Kotri , Pakistan .

[ 35 ] A bounty was put on his head in Pakistan.

[ 35 ] Shahi's books have been banned by the government of Pakistan, [ 31 ] and his followers are not allowed to meet in public.

[ 36 ] Gohar Shahi claimed to have met with Jesus in America .

[ 18 ] Shahi's supporters claim that his face became prominent on the Moon, Sun, nebula star and the Black Stone in Mecca , [ 26 ] and that these appearances are signs from God that Gohar Shahi is the awaited Imam Mahdi , Messiah , and Kalki Avatar .

The alleged images induced greater legal and religious opposition.

[ 36 ] Shahi has also supported this claim, saying that God had revealed the images of Shahi on the Moon and various locations, for which Shahi himself was not responsible, and if questions should be raised, they should be raised to God.

[ 37 ] Messiah Foundation International asserts the alleged images to be signs from God, pointing to Shahi being the awaited Mahdi ; they quote religious texts [ 38 ] as well as sayings from the likes of Nostradamus , [ 39 ] and Ja'far al-Sadiq to support it.

Journalists in Pakistan asked Shahi, "Many believe that you are the Mahdi, and God has revealed signs unto them which say that you are the Mahdi, but you do not officially announce that you are the Mahdi. Why?" Shahi gestured towards himself and answered, "Does Imam Mahdi not know the law of Pakistan? He knows that the law of Pakistan declares that 'whosoever claims to be the Mahdi, put him in jail'. I have given the signs of his [Mahdi's] characteristics, which the Mahdi knows and none other. Now, it is up to people to recognise him and believe him".

[ 37 ] On 18 November 1997, after appearing in court before Justice Rasheed A. Razvi of Sindh High Court Hyderabad Circuit, Shahi said, "The only justification to be Hazrat Imam Mahdi is the mark on [one's] back which can prove his existence".

[ 4 ] Of the groups following Shahi, Messiah Foundation International claims that Shahi is the awaited Mahdi, Messiah, and Kalki Avatar while Anjuman Serfaroshan-e-Islam did not. According to MFI's website, Shahi is the Awaited Messiah, but they deny the notion that Shahi is another form of Jesus and claim that Jesus has also returned to support the Mahdi.

[ 40 ] Bibliography [ edit ] Gohar Shahi authored a number of books, including one based on Sufi poetry known as Taryāq-e-Qalb which translates to the "'Cure of Hearts'". One of his most prominent books is Deen-e-Ilahi (The Religion of God).

Books Of Gohar Shahi Works by Gohar Shahi include: Title Urdu Translation Date Content Taryāq-e-Qalb تریاقِ قلب The Cure of Hearts 1976 Sufi poetry Menāra-e-Noor مینارہِ نور The Minaret of Light 1980 mysticism, spiritualism Roshnās روشناس The Induction 1982 mysticism, spiritualism Rouhani Safar روحانی سفر Spiritual Journey 1986 autobiography Tohfa-tul Majālis تحفةُ المجالس The Gift of Congregations 1988 mysticism, spiritualism Deen-e-Ilāhi دینِ الٰہی The Religion of God [ 41 ] 2000 mysticism, spiritualism On 17 May 2012, Messiah Foundation International republished The Religion of God with Balboa Press .

[ 43 ] Messiah Foundation International considers Shahi to be the author of the "Goharian Philosophy of Divine Love", a set of principles upon which the organisation is founded.

[ 6 ] Shahi has also authored a monthly magazine, Hatif-e-Mahdi , which is banned in Pakistan for allegedly containing material offensive to the religious feelings of Muslims there.
