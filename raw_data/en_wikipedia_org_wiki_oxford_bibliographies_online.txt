History [ edit ] Oxford Bibliographies Online launched in 2010 following 18 months of research by Oxford University Press (OUP) on the way students and scholars accessed information.

[ 1 ] According to OUP, learning on a new topic was often hampered and confused by an overabundance of information that left people without a clear starting point.

[ 1 ] The launch version of Oxford Bibliographies Online covered four subject areas – Classics , Social Work , Islamic Studies , and Criminology – and cost US$29.95 per month to access for institutional subscribers.

[ 1 ] By 2017 it had grown to more than 30 subject areas.

[ 2 ] At its debut, it was described as "an Anti-Google" and a more authoritative and trustworthy alternative to " crowdsourced knowledge repositories like Wikipedia ".

[ 1 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Organization [ edit ] Oxford Bibliographies Online is divided into several dozen subject areas, each curated by an editor-in-chief and an editorial board composed of "15 to 20" scholars of that subject.

[ 5 ] Subject areas are, in turn, divided into an expanding number of entries, each of which is authored by a member of the editorial board and subject to a process of peer review.

[ 5 ] Each entry provides a brief, encyclopedic overview of a given subject, followed by an annotated bibliography of the key literature on that topic.

[ 6 ] According to Oxford University Press, entries are reviewed annually and updated as necessary. New entries are added monthly.

[ 1 ] Access [ edit ] Libraries can selectively subscribe to all or certain subject areas, allowing their patrons to access those sections to which the institution has purchased a subscription.

[ 7 ] In the United Kingdom , for instance, public library patrons can access the Victorian Literature and British and Irish Literature subject areas of Oxford Bibliographies Online by using their library card as a log-on credential if their library subscribes.

[ 8 ] According to Oxford University Press, pricing is based on the size and type of the library.
