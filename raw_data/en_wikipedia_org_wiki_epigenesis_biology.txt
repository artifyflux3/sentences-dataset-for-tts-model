In biology , epigenesis (or, in contrast to preformationism , neoformationism ) is the process by which plants, animals and fungi develop from a seed, spore or egg through a sequence of steps in which cells differentiate and organs form.

[ 1 ] Aristotle first published the theory of epigenesis in his book On the Generation of Animals .

Although epigenesis appears to be an obvious fact in today's genetic age, historically, creationist theories of life's origins hindered its acceptance.

[ 2 ] However, during the late 18th century an extended and controversial debate among biologists finally led epigenesis to eclipse the long-established preformationist view.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] The embryologist Caspar Friedrich Wolff refuted preformationism in 1759 in favor of epigenesis, but this did not put an end to preformationism.
