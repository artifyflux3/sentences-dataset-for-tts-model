The shape of different probability distributions can be compared using standardized moments.

[ 1 ] Standard normalization [ edit ] Let X be a random variable with a probability distribution P and mean value μ μ = E ⁡ ⁡ [ X ] {\textstyle \mu =\operatorname {E} [X]} (i.e. the first raw moment or moment about zero ), the operator E denoting the expected value of X . Then the standardized moment of degree k is μ μ k / σ σ k {\displaystyle \mu _{k}/\sigma ^{k}} , [ 2 ] that is, the ratio of the k -th moment about the mean μ μ k = E ⁡ ⁡ [ ( X − − μ μ ) k ] = ∫ ∫ − − ∞ ∞ ∞ ∞ ( x − − μ μ ) k f ( x ) d x , {\displaystyle \mu _{k}=\operatorname {E} \left[(X-\mu )^{k}\right]=\int _{-\infty }^{\infty }{\left(x-\mu \right)}^{k}f(x)\,dx,} to the k -th power of the standard deviation , σ σ k = μ μ 2 k / 2 = E [ ( X − − μ μ ) 2 ] k / 2 .

{\displaystyle \sigma ^{k}=\mu _{2}^{k/2}=\operatorname {E} \!{\left[{\left(X-\mu \right)}^{2}\right]}^{k/2}.} The power of k is because moments scale as x k {\displaystyle x^{k}} , meaning that μ μ k ( λ λ X ) = λ λ k μ μ k ( X ) : {\displaystyle \mu _{k}(\lambda X)=\lambda ^{k}\mu _{k}(X):} they are homogeneous functions of degree k , thus the standardized moment is scale invariant . This can also be understood as being because moments have dimension; in the above ratio defining standardized moments, the dimensions cancel, so they are dimensionless numbers .

The first four standardized moments can be written as: Degree k Comment 1 μ μ ~ ~ 1 = μ μ 1 σ σ 1 = E ⁡ ⁡ [ ( X − − μ μ ) 1 ] ( E ⁡ ⁡ [ ( X − − μ μ ) 2 ] ) 1 / 2 = μ μ − − μ μ E ⁡ ⁡ [ ( X − − μ μ ) 2 ] = 0 {\displaystyle {\tilde {\mu }}_{1}={\frac {\mu _{1}}{\sigma ^{1}}}={\frac {\operatorname {E} \left[(X-\mu )^{1}\right]}{\left(\operatorname {E} \left[(X-\mu )^{2}\right]\right)^{1/2}}}={\frac {\mu -\mu }{\sqrt {\operatorname {E} \left[(X-\mu )^{2}\right]}}}=0} The first standardized moment is zero, because the first moment about the mean is always zero.

2 μ μ ~ ~ 2 = μ μ 2 σ σ 2 = E ⁡ ⁡ [ ( X − − μ μ ) 2 ] ( E ⁡ ⁡ [ ( X − − μ μ ) 2 ] ) 2 / 2 = 1 {\displaystyle {\tilde {\mu }}_{2}={\frac {\mu _{2}}{\sigma ^{2}}}={\frac {\operatorname {E} \left[(X-\mu )^{2}\right]}{\left(\operatorname {E} \left[(X-\mu )^{2}\right]\right)^{2/2}}}=1} The second standardized moment is one, because the second moment about the mean is equal to the variance σ 2 .

3 μ μ ~ ~ 3 = μ μ 3 σ σ 3 = E ⁡ ⁡ [ ( X − − μ μ ) 3 ] ( E ⁡ ⁡ [ ( X − − μ μ ) 2 ] ) 3 / 2 {\displaystyle {\tilde {\mu }}_{3}={\frac {\mu _{3}}{\sigma ^{3}}}={\frac {\operatorname {E} \left[(X-\mu )^{3}\right]}{\left(\operatorname {E} \left[(X-\mu )^{2}\right]\right)^{3/2}}}} The third standardized moment is a measure of skewness .

4 μ μ ~ ~ 4 = μ μ 4 σ σ 4 = E ⁡ ⁡ [ ( X − − μ μ ) 4 ] ( E ⁡ ⁡ [ ( X − − μ μ ) 2 ] ) 4 / 2 {\displaystyle {\tilde {\mu }}_{4}={\frac {\mu _{4}}{\sigma ^{4}}}={\frac {\operatorname {E} \left[(X-\mu )^{4}\right]}{\left(\operatorname {E} \left[(X-\mu )^{2}\right]\right)^{4/2}}}} The fourth standardized moment refers to the kurtosis .

For skewness and kurtosis, alternative definitions exist, which are based on the third and fourth cumulant respectively.

Other normalizations [ edit ] Further information: Normalization (statistics) Another scale invariant, dimensionless measure for characteristics of a distribution is the coefficient of variation , σ σ / μ μ {\displaystyle \sigma /\mu } . However, this is not a standardized moment, firstly because it is a reciprocal, and secondly because μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } is the first moment about zero (the mean), not the first moment about the mean (which is zero).

See Normalization (statistics) for further normalizing ratios.
