Find sources: "Cauchy index" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( January 2024 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) In mathematical analysis , the Cauchy index is an integer associated to a real rational function over an interval .  By the Routh–Hurwitz theorem , we have the following interpretation: the Cauchy index of r ( x ) = p ( x )/ q ( x ) over the real line is the difference between the number of roots of f ( z ) located in the right half-plane and those located in the left half-plane.  The complex polynomial f ( z ) is such that f ( iy ) = q ( y ) + ip ( y ).

We must also assume that p has degree less than the degree of q .

[ 1 ] Definition [ edit ] The Cauchy index was first defined for a pole s of the rational function r by Augustin-Louis Cauchy in 1837 using one-sided limits as: I s r = { + 1 , if lim x ↑ ↑ s r ( x ) = − − ∞ ∞ ∧ ∧ lim x ↓ ↓ s r ( x ) = + ∞ ∞ , − − 1 , if lim x ↑ ↑ s r ( x ) = + ∞ ∞ ∧ ∧ lim x ↓ ↓ s r ( x ) = − − ∞ ∞ , 0 , otherwise.

{\displaystyle I_{s}r={\begin{cases}+1,&{\text{if }}\displaystyle \lim _{x\uparrow s}r(x)=-\infty \;\land \;\lim _{x\downarrow s}r(x)=+\infty ,\\-1,&{\text{if }}\displaystyle \lim _{x\uparrow s}r(x)=+\infty \;\land \;\lim _{x\downarrow s}r(x)=-\infty ,\\0,&{\text{otherwise.}}\end{cases}}} A generalization over the compact interval [ a , b ] is direct (when neither a nor b are poles of r ( x )): it is the sum of the Cauchy indices I s {\displaystyle I_{s}} of r for each s located in the interval.  We usually denote it by I a b r {\displaystyle I_{a}^{b}r} .

We can then generalize to intervals of type [ − − ∞ ∞ , + ∞ ∞ ] {\displaystyle [-\infty ,+\infty ]} since the number of poles of r is a finite number (by taking the limit of the Cauchy index over [ a , b ] for a and b going to infinity).

Examples [ edit ] A rational function Consider the rational function: r ( x ) = 4 x 3 − − 3 x 16 x 5 − − 20 x 3 + 5 x = p ( x ) q ( x ) .

{\displaystyle r(x)={\frac {4x^{3}-3x}{16x^{5}-20x^{3}+5x}}={\frac {p(x)}{q(x)}}.} We recognize in p ( x ) and q ( x ) respectively the Chebyshev polynomials of degree 3 and 5.  Therefore, r ( x ) has poles x 1 = 0.9511 {\displaystyle x_{1}=0.9511} , x 2 = 0.5878 {\displaystyle x_{2}=0.5878} , x 3 = 0 {\displaystyle x_{3}=0} , x 4 = − − 0.5878 {\displaystyle x_{4}=-0.5878} and x 5 = − − 0.9511 {\displaystyle x_{5}=-0.9511} , i.e.

x j = cos ⁡ ⁡ ( ( 2 i − − 1 ) π π / 2 n ) {\displaystyle x_{j}=\cos((2i-1)\pi /2n)} for j = 1 , .

, 5 {\displaystyle j=1,...,5} .  We can see on the picture that I x 1 r = I x 2 r = 1 {\displaystyle I_{x_{1}}r=I_{x_{2}}r=1} and I x 4 r = I x 5 r = − − 1 {\displaystyle I_{x_{4}}r=I_{x_{5}}r=-1} .  For the pole in zero, we have I x 3 r = 0 {\displaystyle I_{x_{3}}r=0} since the left and right limits are equal (which is because p ( x ) also has a root in zero).  
We conclude that I − − 1 1 r = 0 = I − − ∞ ∞ + ∞ ∞ r {\displaystyle I_{-1}^{1}r=0=I_{-\infty }^{+\infty }r} since q ( x ) has only five roots, all in [−1,1].  We cannot use here the Routh–Hurwitz theorem as each complex polynomial with f ( iy ) = q ( y ) + ip ( y ) has a zero on the imaginary line (namely at the origin).
