The population was 20,800 at the time of the 2020 census .

[ 2 ] It is considered the anchor community of the Greater Mineola area.

The Incorporated Village of Mineola is located primarily in the Town of North Hempstead , with the exception being a small portion of its southern edge within the Town of Hempstead .

[ 3 ] Old Country Road runs along the village's southern border.

The area serviced by the Mineola Post Office extends farther south into the adjacent village of Garden City , where the Old Nassau County Courthouse and other county offices are located.

[ 4 ] Offices of many Nassau County agencies are in both Mineola and Garden City.

History [ edit ] Mineola in 1931 The Mineola Post Office – a landmark listed on the National Register of Historic Places – as seen in 2008 Pre-incorporation [ edit ] The central, flat, grassy part of Long Island was originally known as the Hempstead Plains . In the 19th century, various communities were started in this area. One of those communities was called "Hempstead Branch," which would ultimately be known as "Mineola" later on.

[ 5 ] Long Island was part of Henry Hudson's original claim in the name of the Dutch East India Company dating as far back as 1609. In the 18th century, the Dutch and English settlers worked to clear farmland to start their life on the Hempstead Plains. It was in 1858 when this land was named after an Algonquin Indian Chief, Miniolagamika meaning, "Pleasant Village". The name was later shortened and altered to "Mineola".

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] From about 1787 until the 1870s, the area was the county seat for Queens County , in a section then known as Clowesville – located just outside the Village of Mineola's present territory.

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] That area today is largely in the adjacent hamlet, Garden City Park .

[ 7 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] The western portion of Queens became a borough of New York City in 1898, and in 1899, Nassau County was formed from the part of Queens that did not consolidate. Voters selected Mineola (in the Town of North Hempstead) to be the county seat for the new county of Nassau in November 1898 [ 17 ] (before Mineola incorporated as a village in 1906 and set its boundaries), winning out over Hicksville and Hempstead.

[ 18 ] The Garden City Company (founded in 1893 by the heirs of Alexander Turney Stewart ) [ 19 ] donated four acres of land for the county buildings just south of the Mineola LIRR station and the present day Village of Mineola, in the Town of Hempstead; these buildings today are physically located within the territory constituting the Village of Garden City but use the Mineola ZIP Code.

[ 20 ] [ 21 ] Mineola officially became the County Seat of Nassau County on July 13, 1900, as Governor Theodore Roosevelt laid the cornerstone of the Nassau County Court House. A celebration was held to commemorate the occasion on the barren 5-acre (20,000 m 2 ) site at the corner of Old Country Road and Franklin Avenue. Many dignitaries were present to witness this event such as Frederick Hicks , Congressman Townsend Scudder , Colonel William Youngs and Supervisors William Jones and Edwin Willits.

[ 7 ] Village of Mineola, 1906–present [ edit ] Mineola was legally incorporated as a village in 1906 and run by a president. The lands on which the County buildings sat were not included as part of the village. The land and the buildings have a Mineola postal address, but are within the present day Village of Garden City , which did not incorporate or set its boundaries until 1919.

[ 22 ] NYU Langone Hospital – Long Island founded in 1896 by local physicians and residents as Nassau Hospital – was Long Island's first voluntary hospital. In 1897, it admitted 91 patients, performed 27 operations, and reported two births and eight deaths during the first year. The original hospital was constructed in 1900. Renamed Winthrop-University Hospital in the 1980s, it is now a nationally recognized award-winning hospital and in 2004 was ranked among the Top 5 Percent of Acute-Care Hospitals in the Country.

[ 23 ] In 1888, the Mineola Fire Department was formed in the Willis Avenue School house. The department soon moved to a location on Washington Avenue. The department originally consisted of volunteer firemen and would officially be incorporated as an official company in 1889.

[ 24 ] In 1839, the Long Island Rail Road reached Mineola, with the community's eponymous station along what is now the Main Line opening that same year.

[ 7 ] In 1840, the Mineola Hotel was built by resident John A. Searing across from the LIRR station, which had been completed the year prior. When the village was separated from Queens and became the county seat of Nassau, it was renamed to Allen's Mineola Hotel .

[ 23 ] It is considered a landmark alongside the local offices and agencies in Garden City. An adjacent inn, also named the Mineola Hotel, burned down in 1966 as the result of arson. One man was killed and seven others were injured. A jobless machinist, a 20 year old hotel resident named Chlary Skorge, Jr. who was previously on probation for robbery, was indicted for murder. The cause was speculated to be revenge, as he was threatened with eviction after annoying fellow residents.

[ 25 ] Main Street was the center of village business as well as a popular meeting place for farmers and the business community alike. The general store offered an array of goods that would fulfill most everyday needs, such as hardware, toys, wool, dry goods, clothing and food. The small glass-fronted mail and delivery boxes filled the existing six-foot post office. As the Mineola population grew, the post office was relocated to the Meyer Building on Mineola Boulevard, and then twice more to 3rd Street and 2nd Street. It eventually found its permanent home on 1st Street and Main Street. As years passed, Jericho Turnpike became the commercial "main street" within Mineola. Farmland was sold off and homes and offices were built. Mineola would continue to be a community of growth and development – a trend continuing into the 21st century.

[ 26 ] Mineola's first theater named Allen's Hall drew in many early moviegoers to see "the flickers". Motion picture success drew in other theaters to the area, the most lavish being the Century Opera House. Most theaters had a showing in the morning and in the evening, usually featuring a live pianist who kept up with the action of the movie while playing music that suited the story.

[ 23 ] The centennial celebration for Mineola was held in 2006.

[ 27 ] Developments for this celebration originated in 2004 from a Centennial Committee formed by then-mayor Jack M. Martins . Co-chairing this were John DaVanzo, former mayor Robert W. Hinck, Sr., and Candida Maia. Various events commenced in January 2006, including the Nassau Pops Symphony Orchestra performing at Chaminade High School , the installation of LIRR Caboose #50 in Memorial Park, the unveiling of a historical quilt by the Nimble Fingers quilting group, and a Centennial Journal delivered to residents and businesses. In March, a fashion show entitled “Decade by Decade” was hosted by Fox’s department store at the Corpus Christi Knights of Columbus Hall, and a marching parade consisting of 80 units took place later in October. The final event was an ecumenical service at Mineola Middle School in December, followed by fireworks in Mineola Memorial Park.

Mineola is home to large Portuguese communities – and it has been for decades.

[ 28 ] Portuguese restaurants and businesses – in addition to the Portuguese language – are a common feature throughout the village.

[ 28 ] According to census data, the village contains approximately 1,900 Portuguese residents, out of the 5,100 total across Long Island.

[ 29 ] In 2005–2006, as a result of numerous recommendations from the community that Mineola increase its police force, a Mineola Police Task Force was appointed by then-Mayor Jack M. Martins to evaluate the feasibility of withdrawing from the Nassau County Police Department and establishing a village police department. The Mayor indicated to the Task Force at its inception that if the feasibility study resulted in a positive report, Mineola would only have its own police department if the residents approved such through a village-wide referendum.

[ 30 ] The village board was split 3–2 in favor of the police force, with Mayor Martins, Deputy Mayor Werther, and Trustee Davanzo supporting it – while Trustees Fargrieve and Cusato opposed it. On December 5, 2006, the measure was defeated by a 2–1 margin.

[ 31 ] In the 2010s and 2020s, the Village of Mineola's downtown has seen significant growth, in part credited to the creation of large-scale transit-oriented development in the vicinity of the Mineola LIRR station.

[ 26 ] Prevalence in aviation [ edit ] Mineola was also a familiar place to many of the most famous pilots in history. The Aero Club of America chose the area for the level plains.

Glenn Curtiss brought the area to national attention in July 1909 with his second Scientific American Award flight of over 23 minutes and 15 miles. He also made some of the first public flights in America in his "Golden Flyer", while practicing for the Reims Aviation Meet in France. The Wright Brothers , Igor Sikorsky , Captain Rene Fonck, and the famed duo of Clarence Chamberlain and Bert Acosta , dubbed "twins of derring-do", all spent time in Mineola taking advantage of the rolling grasslands and favorable winds.

On November 1, 1915, Captain Raynal Cawthorne Bolling , a New York attorney working at United States Steel , organized the Aviation Detachment, 1st Battalion Signal Corps of the New York National Guard (now the 102nd Rescue Squadron ). It was the Guard's first genuine aviation unit. Subsequently, the organization was re-designated as the 1st Aero Company. Located at Mineola on Long Island, the unit rented and then purchased its own aircraft with funds donated by the Aero Club of America and other contributors. It was "provisionally recognized" on June 22, 1916, and then called into federal service on July 13, 1916, during the Mexican border crisis. However, instead of active service in the southwest, it remained at Mineola for training and was ultimately released from federal service on November 2, 1916.

After World War I, the British Royal Navy rigid airship R34 made the first-ever east–west aerial crossing of the North Atlantic , traveling from the airship base at RAF East Fortune in the UK to Mineola from July 2 to 6, 1919.

[ 32 ] [ 33 ] On May 20, 1927, at 7:52 a.m., Charles Lindbergh started his historic flight on the Spirit of St. Louis from nearby Roosevelt Field .

[ 34 ] Thirty-three hours later he landed in Paris and became the first person to complete a solo flight from the United States across the Atlantic Ocean. This historic feat was given numerous test flights in the weeks leading up to his departure, particularly in San Diego and St. Louis . On May 20, 1977, fifty years after the flight, a thirteen-cent commemorative stamp depicting the Spirit of St. Louis over the Atlantic Ocean was issued in commemoration.

[ 35 ] Etymology [ edit ] The village's name is derived from an Algonquin Chief, Miniolagamika, which means "pleasant village." [ 6 ] Geography [ edit ] U.S. Census map of Mineola According to the United States Census Bureau , the village has an area of 1.9 square miles (4.9 km 2 ), all land.

[ 36 ] The village gained territory between the 1990 census and the 2000 census.

[ 37 ] Mineola is located approximately 21 miles (34 km) east of Midtown Manhattan and 4 miles (6 km) from the Queens border. The villages bordering Mineola are East Williston and Williston Park to the north, and Garden City to the south. Mineola also borders the hamlets ( CDP ) of Carle Place to the east, Garden City Park and Herricks to the west, and Roslyn Heights to the north.

Near the center of the village, Mineola Memorial Park commemorates the victims of the September 11 terrorist attacks with a monument. Mineola's own Memorial Library, as well as multiple private & public schools, adjoin the park.

[ 38 ] The Memorial Tablet and surrounding paths were an Eagle Project by Troop 45 Eagle Scout Edward Kaiser.

From the final withdrawal of the British in November, 1783, until the 1830s, Queens continued as an essentially Long Island area of farms and villages. The location of the county government in Mineola (in present-day Nassau County) underscores the island orientation of that era. Population grew hardly at all, increasing only from 5,791 in 1800 to 7,806 in 1830, suggesting that many younger sons moved away, seeking fortunes where land was not yet so fully taken up for farming.

The 1777 New York State Constitution, Article XXXVI, confirmed land grants and municipal charters granted by the English Crown prior to October 14, 1775. Chapter 64 of the Laws of 1788 organized the state into towns and cities...The basic composition of the counties was set in 1788 when the State Legislature divided all of the counties then existing into towns. Towns, of course, were of earlier origin, but in that year they acquired a new legal status as components of the counties.

The building shown below "is one of the most important buildings in the history of Mineola," wrote Jack Hehman, president of the Mineola Historical Society. Built in 1787 and known as the "old brig," it was the first Queens County courthouse and later a home for the mentally ill. The building was at Jericho Turnpike and Herricks Road until 1910, when it burned to the ground.

There was only one post office established in present Nassau County when the Long Island post road to Sag Harbor was established September 25, 1794. It appears that the mail from New York went to Jamaica. This was the only post office in the present day Boroughs of Queens or Brooklyn before 1803. From Jamaica the mail went east along the Jericho Turnpike/Middle Country Road route and ended at Sag Harbor. The only post office on this route between Jamaica and Suffolk County was QUEENS established the same date as the others on this route 9/25/1794. This post office was officially Queens, but I have seen the area called "Queens Court House" and was located approximately in the Mineola-Westbury area. The courthouse was used until the 1870s when the county court was moved to Long Island City. Later it served as the Queens County Insane Asylum and still later as an early courthouse for the new Nassau County, during construction of the present "old" Nassau County Courthouse in Mineola. It was demolished shortly after 1900 ... after about 120 years of service of one type or the other.
