He and Paul G. Richards coauthored "Quantitative Seismology: theory and methods".

[ 1 ] Biography [ edit ] Aki was born in Yokohama , Japan. He received his bachelor's degree in 1952 and doctoral degree in 1958, both from the University of Tokyo . Until 1960, he conducted research at that university's Earthquake Research Institute.  He then did post-doctoral research at the Caltech Seismological Laboratory , where he worked with Frank Press .

[ 2 ] Press invited Aki to join him at MIT in 1966.  This second visit to the United States coincided with the 1966 Parkfield earthquake , noteworthy for its so-called coda waves, reverberations of seismic energy due to multiple scattering from subsurface inhomogeneities. Aki "developed a passion for using those waves to investigate Earth," according to Bill Ellsworth, Aki's former student who was later head of the USGS seismology group.  "He came from Japan as a statistically oriented seismologist, but he was not afraid to transform himself." [ 2 ] Aki was very active in his field and was the president or chair of many organizations. He was the president of Seismological Section of the AGU , president of the Seismological Society of America , and Chair of the NAS Committee on Seismology. He was instrumental in the creation of the Southern California Earthquake Center , headquartered at the University of Southern California , in 1991, he having moved to USC from MIT in 1984.

In 1995, Aki moved to the seismically active island Réunion , east of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean, where he continued to work until his death there in 2005.

[ 3 ] He sustained an injury to his brain from a fall while walking in the street on May 13; he fell into a coma and died on May 17. He is buried in Le Tampon cemetery. He left behind two sons (Shota and Zenta) and two daughters (Kajika and Uka).
