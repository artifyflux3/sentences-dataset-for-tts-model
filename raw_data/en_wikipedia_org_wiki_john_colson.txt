Life [ edit ] John Colson was educated at Lichfield School before becoming an undergraduate at Christ Church, Oxford , though he did not complete a degree there. 
He became a schoolmaster at Sir Joseph Williamson's Mathematical School in Rochester, and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1713. 
He was Vicar of Chalk , Kent from 1724 to 1740. 
He relocated to Cambridge and lectured at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge .

[ 1 ] From 1739 to 1760, he was Lucasian Professor of Mathematics. He was also Rector of Lockington, Yorkshire .

[ 2 ] Works [ edit ] In 1726 he published his "Negativo-Affirmativo Arithmetik" , which advocated a modified decimal system of numeration.

[ 3 ] He proposed "reduction [to] small figures" by "throwing all the large figures 9 , 8 , 7 , 6 {\displaystyle 9,8,7,6} out of a given number, and introducing in their room the equivalent small figures 1 1 ¯ ¯ , 1 2 ¯ ¯ , 1 3 ¯ ¯ , 1 4 ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle 1{\bar {1}},1{\bar {2}},1{\bar {3}},1{\bar {4}}} respectively". This method of signifying numbers is now called signed-digit representation .

[ 4 ] John Colson translated several of Isaac Newton 's works into English, including De Methodis Serierum et Fluxionum in 1736.
