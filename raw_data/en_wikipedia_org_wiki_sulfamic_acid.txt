Y verify ( what is Y N ?) Infobox references Chemical compound Sulfamic acid , also known as amidosulfonic acid , amidosulfuric acid , aminosulfonic acid , sulphamic acid and sulfamidic acid , is a molecular compound with the formula H 3 NSO 3 . This colourless, water-soluble compound finds many applications. Sulfamic acid melts at 205 °C before decomposing at higher temperatures to water , sulfur trioxide , sulfur dioxide and nitrogen .

[ 2 ] Sulfamic acid (H 3 NSO 3 ) may be considered an intermediate compound between sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4 ) and sulfamide (H 4 N 2 SO 2 ), effectively replacing a hydroxyl (−OH) group with an amine (−NH 2 ) group at each step. This pattern can extend no further in either direction without breaking down the sulfonyl (−SO 2 −) moiety.

Sulfamates are derivatives of sulfamic acid.

Production [ edit ] Sulfamic acid is produced industrially by treating urea with a mixture of sulfur trioxide and sulfuric acid (or oleum ). The conversion is conducted in two stages, the first being sulfamation : OC(NH 2 ) 2 + SO 3 → OC(NH 2 )(NHSO 3 H) OC(NH 2 )(NHSO 3 H) + H 2 SO 4 → CO 2 + 2 H 3 NSO 3 In this way, approximately 96,000 tonnes were produced in 1995.

[ 3 ] Structure and reactivity [ edit ] Ball-and-stick model of a sulfamic acid zwitterion as it occurs in the crystal state [ 4 ] The compound is well described by the formula H 3 NSO 3 , not the tautomer H 2 NSO 2 (OH). The relevant bond distances are 1.44 Å for the S=O and 1.77 Å for the S−N. The greater length of the S−N is consistent with a single bond.

[ 5 ] Furthermore, a neutron diffraction study located the hydrogen atoms, all three of which are 1.03 Å distant from the nitrogen.

[ 4 ] In the solid state, the molecule of sulfamic acid is well described by a zwitterionic form.

Hydrolysis [ edit ] The crystalline solid is indefinitely stable under ordinary storage conditions; however, aqueous solutions of sulfamic acid slowly hydrolyse to ammonium bisulfate , according to the following reaction: H 3 NSO 3 + H 2 O → [NH 4 ] + [HSO 4 ] − Its behaviour resembles that of urea , (H 2 N) 2 CO. Both feature amino groups linked to electron-withdrawing centres that can participate in delocalised bonding . Both liberate ammonia upon heating in water, with urea releasing CO 2 , while sulfamic acid releases sulfuric acid .

Acid–base reactions [ edit ] Sulfamic acid is a moderately strong acid, K a = 0.101 (p K a = 0.995). Because the solid is not hygroscopic , it is used as a standard in acidimetry (quantitative assays of acid content).

H 3 NSO 3 + NaOH → NaH 2 NSO 3 + H 2 O Double deprotonation can be effected in liquid ammonia to give the anion HNSO 2− 3 .

[ 6 ] H 3 NSO 3 + 2 NH 3 → HNSO 2− 3 + 2 NH + 4 Reaction with nitric and nitrous acids [ edit ] With nitrous acid , sulfamic acid reacts to give nitrogen : HNO 2 + H 3 NSO 3 → H 2 SO 4 + N 2 + H 2 O while with concentrated nitric acid , it affords nitrous oxide : [ 7 ] HNO 3 + H 3 NSO 3 → H 2 SO 4 + N 2 O + H 2 O Reaction with hypochlorite [ edit ] The reaction of excess hypochlorite ions with sulfamic acid or a sulfamate salt gives rise reversibly to both N -chlorosulfamate and N , N -dichlorosulfamate ions.

[ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] HClO + H 2 NSO 3 H → ClNHSO 3 H + H 2 O HClO + ClNHSO 3 H ⇌ Cl 2 NSO 3 H + H 2 O Consequently, sulfamic acid is used as hypochlorite scavenger in the oxidation of aldehydes with chlorite such as the Pinnick oxidation .

Reaction with alcohols [ edit ] Upon heating, sulfamic acid reacts with alcohols to form the corresponding organosulfates . It is more expensive than other reagents for doing this, such as chlorosulfonic acid or oleum , but is also significantly milder and does not sulfonate aromatic rings. Products are produced as their ammonium salts. Such reactions can be catalyzed by the presence of urea .

[ 10 ] Without the presence of any catalysts, sulfamic acid does not react with ethanol at temperatures below 100 °C.

ROH + H 2 NSO 3 H → ROS(O) 2 O − + NH + 4 An example of this reaction is the production 2-ethylhexyl sulfate, a wetting agent used in the mercerisation of cotton, by combining sulfamic acid with 2-ethylhexanol .

Applications [ edit ] Sulfamic acid is mainly a precursor to sweet-tasting compounds. Reaction with cyclohexylamine followed by addition of NaOH gives C 6 H 11 NHSO 3 Na, sodium cyclamate . Related compounds are also sweeteners , such as acesulfame potassium .

Sulfamates have been used in the design of many types of therapeutic agents such as antibiotics , nucleoside/nucleotide human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) reverse transcriptase inhibitors , HIV protease inhibitors (PIs), anticancer drugs ( steroid sulfatase and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors), anti-epileptic drugs, and weight loss drugs .

[ 11 ] Cleaning agent [ edit ] Sulfamic acid is used as an acidic cleaning agent and descaling agent, either pure or as a component of proprietary mixtures, typically for metals and ceramics . For cleaning purposes, there are different grades based on application such as GP grade, SR grade and TM grade [ clarification needed ] . It is frequently used for removing rust and limescale , replacing the more volatile and irritating hydrochloric acid , which is cheaper. It is often a component of household descalant, for example, Lime-A-Way Thick Gel contains up to 8% sulfamic acid and has pH 2.0–2.2, [ 12 ] or detergents used for removal of limescale . When compared to most of the common strong mineral acids , sulfamic acid has desirable water descaling properties, low volatility, and low toxicity. It forms water-soluble salts of calcium, nickel, and ferric iron.

Sulfamic acid is preferable to hydrochloric acid in household use, due to its intrinsic safety. If inadvertently mixed with hypochlorite-based products, such as bleach , it does not form chlorine gas, whereas the most common acids would; the reaction ( neutralisation ) with ammonia produces a salt, as depicted in the section above.

It also finds applications in the industrial cleaning of dairy and brewhouse equipment. Although it is considered less corrosive than hydrochloric acid , corrosion inhibitors are often added to the commercial cleansers of which it is a component. It can be used as a descalant for descaling home coffee and espresso machines and in denture cleaners.

Other uses [ edit ] Catalyst for esterification process Dye and pigment manufacturing Herbicide , as ammonium sulfamate Descalant for scale removal Coagulator for urea-formaldehyde resins Ingredient in fire extinguishing media . Sulfamic acid is the main raw material for ammonium sulfamate , which is a widely used herbicide and fire-retardant material for household products.

Pulp and paper industry, as a chloride stabilizer Synthesis of nitrous oxide by reaction with nitric acid The deprotonated form (sulfamate) is a common counterion for nickel(II) in electroplating .

Used to separate nitrite ions from mixture of nitrite and nitrate ions (NO 3 − + NO 2 − ) during qualitative analysis of nitrate by brown ring test .

Obtaining deep eutectic solvents with urea [ 13 ] Silver polishing [ edit ] According to the label on the consumer product, the silver cleaning product TarnX contains thiourea , a detergent , and sulfamic acid.
