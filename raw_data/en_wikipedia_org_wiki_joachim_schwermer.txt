Education [ edit ] Schwermer received his Abitur in 1969 at Aloisiuskolleg in Bad Godesberg and then studied mathematics at the University of Bonn .

[ citation needed ] After graduating in 1974 with his Diplom , he received in 1977 his Promotion (Ph.D.) underi Günter Harder with thesis Eisensteinreihen und die Kohomologie von Kongruenzuntergruppen von S L n ( Z ) {\displaystyle SL_{n}(\mathbb {Z} )} .

[ 2 ] In 1982 he received his Habilitation from the University of Bonn .

Career [ edit ] From 1986 he was a professor at the Catholic University of Eichstätt-Ingolstadt , then at the University of Düsseldorf , [ 3 ] and finally in the 2000s at the University of Vienna . During the academic year 1980–1981 Schwermer was a visiting scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study . He is the scientific director at the Erwin Schrödinger International Institute for Mathematical Physics .

Research [ edit ] Schwermer's research deals with algebraic groups in number theory, arithmetic geometry, Lie groups, and L-functions. He has written essays on the history of mathematics, for example, about Helmut Hasse , Hermann Minkowski , and Emil Artin .

Awards and honors [ edit ] In 1987 he was awarded the Gay-Lussac-Humboldt-Prize .
