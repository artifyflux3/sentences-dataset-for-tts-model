The order here is x ≤ ≤ y {\displaystyle x\leq y} if and only if x 1 ≤ ≤ y 1 {\displaystyle x_{1}\leq y_{1}} and x 2 ≤ ≤ y 2 .

{\displaystyle x_{2}\leq y_{2}.} In mathematics , an ordered vector space or partially ordered vector space is a vector space equipped with a partial order that is compatible with the vector space operations.

Definition [ edit ] Given a vector space X {\displaystyle X} over the real numbers R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } and a preorder ≤ ≤ {\displaystyle \,\leq \,} on the set X , {\displaystyle X,} the pair ( X , ≤ ≤ ) {\displaystyle (X,\leq )} is called a preordered vector space and we say that the preorder ≤ ≤ {\displaystyle \,\leq \,} is compatible with the vector space structure of X {\displaystyle X} and call ≤ ≤ {\displaystyle \,\leq \,} a vector preorder on X {\displaystyle X} if for all x , y , z ∈ ∈ X {\displaystyle x,y,z\in X} and r ∈ ∈ R {\displaystyle r\in \mathbb {R} } with r ≥ ≥ 0 {\displaystyle r\geq 0} the following two axioms are satisfied x ≤ ≤ y {\displaystyle x\leq y} implies x + z ≤ ≤ y + z , {\displaystyle x+z\leq y+z,} y ≤ ≤ x {\displaystyle y\leq x} implies r y ≤ ≤ r x .

{\displaystyle ry\leq rx.} If ≤ ≤ {\displaystyle \,\leq \,} is a partial order compatible with the vector space structure of X {\displaystyle X} then ( X , ≤ ≤ ) {\displaystyle (X,\leq )} is called an ordered vector space and ≤ ≤ {\displaystyle \,\leq \,} is called a vector partial order on X .

{\displaystyle X.} The two axioms imply that translations and positive homotheties are automorphisms of the order structure and the mapping x ↦ ↦ − − x {\displaystyle x\mapsto -x} is an isomorphism to the dual order structure . Ordered vector spaces are ordered groups under their addition operation.
Note that x ≤ ≤ y {\displaystyle x\leq y} if and only if − − y ≤ ≤ − − x .

{\displaystyle -y\leq -x.} Positive cones and their equivalence to orderings [ edit ] A subset C {\displaystyle C} of a vector space X {\displaystyle X} is called a cone if for all real r > 0 , {\displaystyle r>0,} r C ⊆ ⊆ C {\displaystyle rC\subseteq C} .  A cone is called pointed if it contains the origin. A cone C {\displaystyle C} is convex if and only if C + C ⊆ ⊆ C .

{\displaystyle C+C\subseteq C.} The intersection of any non-empty family of cones (resp. convex cones) is again a cone (resp. convex cone); 
the same is true of the union of an increasing (under set inclusion ) family of cones (resp. convex cones). A cone C {\displaystyle C} in a vector space X {\displaystyle X} is said to be generating if X = C − − C .

{\displaystyle X=C-C.} [ 1 ] Given a preordered vector space X , {\displaystyle X,} the subset X + {\displaystyle X^{+}} of all elements x {\displaystyle x} in ( X , ≤ ≤ ) {\displaystyle (X,\leq )} satisfying x ≥ ≥ 0 {\displaystyle x\geq 0} is a pointed convex cone (that is, a convex cone containing 0 {\displaystyle 0} ) called the positive cone of X {\displaystyle X} and denoted by PosCone ⁡ ⁡ X .

{\displaystyle \operatorname {PosCone} X.} The elements of the positive cone are called positive . 
If x {\displaystyle x} and y {\displaystyle y} are elements of a preordered vector space ( X , ≤ ≤ ) , {\displaystyle (X,\leq ),} then x ≤ ≤ y {\displaystyle x\leq y} if and only if y − − x ∈ ∈ X + .

{\displaystyle y-x\in X^{+}.} The positive cone is generating if and only if X {\displaystyle X} is a directed set under ≤ ≤ .

{\displaystyle \,\leq .} Given any pointed convex cone C {\displaystyle C} one may define a preorder ≤ ≤ {\displaystyle \,\leq \,} on X {\displaystyle X} that is compatible with the vector space structure of X {\displaystyle X} by declaring for all x , y ∈ ∈ X , {\displaystyle x,y\in X,} that x ≤ ≤ y {\displaystyle x\leq y} if and only if y − − x ∈ ∈ C ; {\displaystyle y-x\in C;} the positive cone of this resulting preordered vector space is C .

{\displaystyle C.} There is thus a one-to-one correspondence between pointed convex cones and vector preorders on X .

{\displaystyle X.} [ 1 ] If X {\displaystyle X} is preordered then we may form an equivalence relation on X {\displaystyle X} by defining x {\displaystyle x} is equivalent to y {\displaystyle y} if and only if x ≤ ≤ y {\displaystyle x\leq y} and y ≤ ≤ x ; {\displaystyle y\leq x;} if N {\displaystyle N} is the equivalence class containing the origin then N {\displaystyle N} is a vector subspace of X {\displaystyle X} and X / N {\displaystyle X/N} is an ordered vector space under the relation: A ≤ ≤ B {\displaystyle A\leq B} if and only there exist a ∈ ∈ A {\displaystyle a\in A} and b ∈ ∈ B {\displaystyle b\in B} such that a ≤ ≤ b .

{\displaystyle a\leq b.} [ 1 ] A subset of C {\displaystyle C} of a vector space X {\displaystyle X} is called a proper cone if it is a convex cone satisfying C ∩ ∩ ( − − C ) = { 0 } .

{\displaystyle C\cap (-C)=\{0\}.} Explicitly, C {\displaystyle C} is a proper cone if (1) C + C ⊆ ⊆ C , {\displaystyle C+C\subseteq C,} (2) r C ⊆ ⊆ C {\displaystyle rC\subseteq C} for all r > 0 , {\displaystyle r>0,} and (3) C ∩ ∩ ( − − C ) = { 0 } .

{\displaystyle C\cap (-C)=\{0\}.} [ 2 ] The intersection of any non-empty family of proper cones is again a proper cone. Each proper cone C {\displaystyle C} in a real vector space induces an order on the vector space by defining x ≤ ≤ y {\displaystyle x\leq y} if and only if y − − x ∈ ∈ C , {\displaystyle y-x\in C,} and furthermore, the positive cone of this ordered vector space will be C .

{\displaystyle C.} Therefore, there exists a one-to-one correspondence between the proper convex cones of X {\displaystyle X} and the vector partial orders on X .

{\displaystyle X.} By a total vector ordering on X {\displaystyle X} we mean a total order on X {\displaystyle X} that is compatible with the vector space structure of X .

{\displaystyle X.} The family of total vector orderings on a vector space X {\displaystyle X} is in one-to-one correspondence with the family of all proper cones that are maximal under set inclusion.

[ 1 ] A total vector ordering cannot be Archimedean if its dimension , when considered as a vector space over the reals, is greater than 1.

[ 1 ] If R {\displaystyle R} and S {\displaystyle S} are two orderings of a vector space with positive cones P {\displaystyle P} and Q , {\displaystyle Q,} respectively, then we say that R {\displaystyle R} is finer than S {\displaystyle S} if P ⊆ ⊆ Q .

{\displaystyle P\subseteq Q.} [ 2 ] Intervals and the order bound dual [ edit ] An order interval in a preordered vector space is a set of the form [ a , b ] = { x : a ≤ ≤ x ≤ ≤ b } , [ a , b [ = { x : a ≤ ≤ x < b } , ] a , b ] = { x : a < x ≤ ≤ b } , or ] a , b [ = { x : a < x < b } .

{\displaystyle {\begin{alignedat}{4}[a,b]&=\{x:a\leq x\leq b\},\\[0.1ex][a,b[&=\{x:a\leq x<b\},\\]a,b]&=\{x:a<x\leq b\},{\text{ or }}\\]a,b[&=\{x:a<x<b\}.\\\end{alignedat}}} From axioms 1 and 2 above it follows that x , y ∈ ∈ [ a , b ] {\displaystyle x,y\in [a,b]} and 0 < t < 1 {\displaystyle 0<t<1} implies t x + ( 1 − − t ) y {\displaystyle tx+(1-t)y} belongs to [ a , b ] ; {\displaystyle [a,b];} thus these order intervals are convex.  
A subset is said to be order bounded if it is contained in some order interval.

[ 2 ] In a preordered real vector space, if for x ≥ ≥ 0 {\displaystyle x\geq 0} then the interval of the form [ − − x , x ] {\displaystyle [-x,x]} is balanced .

[ 2 ] An order unit of a preordered vector space is any element x {\displaystyle x} such that the set [ − − x , x ] {\displaystyle [-x,x]} is absorbing .

[ 2 ] The set of all linear functionals on a preordered vector space X {\displaystyle X} that map every order interval into a bounded set is called the order bound dual of X {\displaystyle X} and denoted by X b .

{\displaystyle X^{\operatorname {b} }.} [ 2 ] If a space is ordered then its order bound dual is a vector subspace of its algebraic dual .

A subset A {\displaystyle A} of an ordered vector space X {\displaystyle X} is called order complete if for every non-empty subset B ⊆ ⊆ A {\displaystyle B\subseteq A} such that B {\displaystyle B} is order bounded in A , {\displaystyle A,} both sup B {\displaystyle \sup B} and inf B {\displaystyle \inf B} exist and are elements of A .

{\displaystyle A.} We say that an ordered vector space X {\displaystyle X} is order complete is X {\displaystyle X} is an order complete subset of X .

{\displaystyle X.} [ 3 ] Examples [ edit ] If ( X , ≤ ≤ ) {\displaystyle (X,\leq )} is a preordered vector space over the reals with order unit u , {\displaystyle u,} then the map p ( x ) := inf { t ∈ ∈ R : x ≤ ≤ t u } {\displaystyle p(x):=\inf\{t\in \mathbb {R} :x\leq tu\}} is a sublinear functional .

[ 4 ] Properties [ edit ] If X {\displaystyle X} is a preordered vector space then for all x , y ∈ ∈ X , {\displaystyle x,y\in X,} x ≥ ≥ 0 {\displaystyle x\geq 0} and y ≥ ≥ 0 {\displaystyle y\geq 0} imply x + y ≥ ≥ 0.

{\displaystyle x+y\geq 0.} [ 4 ] x ≤ ≤ y {\displaystyle x\leq y} if and only if − − y ≤ ≤ − − x .

{\displaystyle -y\leq -x.} [ 4 ] x ≤ ≤ y {\displaystyle x\leq y} and r < 0 {\displaystyle r<0} imply r x ≥ ≥ r y .

{\displaystyle rx\geq ry.} [ 4 ] x ≤ ≤ y {\displaystyle x\leq y} if and only if y = sup { x , y } {\displaystyle y=\sup\{x,y\}} if and only if x = inf { x , y } {\displaystyle x=\inf\{x,y\}} [ 4 ] sup { x , y } {\displaystyle \sup\{x,y\}} exists if and only if inf { − − x , − − y } {\displaystyle \inf\{-x,-y\}} exists, in which case inf { − − x , − − y } = − − sup { x , y } .

{\displaystyle \inf\{-x,-y\}=-\sup\{x,y\}.} [ 4 ] sup { x , y } {\displaystyle \sup\{x,y\}} exists if and only if inf { x , y } {\displaystyle \inf\{x,y\}} exists, in which case for all z ∈ ∈ X , {\displaystyle z\in X,} [ 4 ] sup { x + z , y + z } = z + sup { x , y } , {\displaystyle \sup\{x+z,y+z\}=z+\sup\{x,y\},} and inf { x + z , y + z } = z + inf { x , y } {\displaystyle \inf\{x+z,y+z\}=z+\inf\{x,y\}} x + y = inf { x , y } + sup { x , y } .

{\displaystyle x+y=\inf\{x,y\}+\sup\{x,y\}.} X {\displaystyle X} is a vector lattice if and only if sup { 0 , x } {\displaystyle \sup\{0,x\}} exists for all x ∈ ∈ X .

{\displaystyle x\in X.} [ 4 ] Spaces of linear maps [ edit ] Main article: Positive linear operator A cone C {\displaystyle C} is said to be generating if C − − C {\displaystyle C-C} is equal to the whole vector space.

[ 2 ] If X {\displaystyle X} and W {\displaystyle W} are two non-trivial ordered vector spaces with respective positive cones P {\displaystyle P} and Q , {\displaystyle Q,} then P {\displaystyle P} is generating in X {\displaystyle X} if and only if the set C = { u ∈ ∈ L ( X ; W ) : u ( P ) ⊆ ⊆ Q } {\displaystyle C=\{u\in L(X;W):u(P)\subseteq Q\}} is a proper cone in L ( X ; W ) , {\displaystyle L(X;W),} which is the space of all linear maps from X {\displaystyle X} into W .

{\displaystyle W.} In this case, the ordering defined by C {\displaystyle C} is called the canonical ordering of L ( X ; W ) .

{\displaystyle L(X;W).} [ 2 ] More generally, if M {\displaystyle M} is any vector subspace of L ( X ; W ) {\displaystyle L(X;W)} such that C ∩ ∩ M {\displaystyle C\cap M} is a proper cone, the ordering defined by C ∩ ∩ M {\displaystyle C\cap M} is called the canonical ordering of M .

{\displaystyle M.} [ 2 ] Positive functionals and the order dual [ edit ] A linear function f {\displaystyle f} on a preordered vector space is called positive if it satisfies either of the following equivalent conditions: x ≥ ≥ 0 {\displaystyle x\geq 0} implies f ( x ) ≥ ≥ 0.

{\displaystyle f(x)\geq 0.} if x ≤ ≤ y {\displaystyle x\leq y} then f ( x ) ≤ ≤ f ( y ) .

{\displaystyle f(x)\leq f(y).} [ 4 ] The set of all positive linear forms on a vector space with positive cone C , {\displaystyle C,} called the dual cone and denoted by C ∗ ∗ , {\displaystyle C^{*},} is a cone equal to the polar of − − C .

{\displaystyle -C.} The preorder induced by the dual cone on the space of linear functionals on X {\displaystyle X} is called the dual preorder .

[ 4 ] The order dual of an ordered vector space X {\displaystyle X} is the set, denoted by X + , {\displaystyle X^{+},} defined by X + := C ∗ ∗ − − C ∗ ∗ .

{\displaystyle X^{+}:=C^{*}-C^{*}.} Although X + ⊆ ⊆ X b , {\displaystyle X^{+}\subseteq X^{b},} there do exist ordered vector spaces for which set equality does not hold.

[ 2 ] Special types of ordered vector spaces [ edit ] Let X {\displaystyle X} be an ordered vector space. We say that an ordered vector space X {\displaystyle X} is Archimedean ordered and that the order of X {\displaystyle X} is Archimedean if whenever x {\displaystyle x} in X {\displaystyle X} is such that { n x : n ∈ ∈ N } {\displaystyle \{nx:n\in \mathbb {N} \}} is majorized (that is, there exists some y ∈ ∈ X {\displaystyle y\in X} such that n x ≤ ≤ y {\displaystyle nx\leq y} for all n ∈ ∈ N {\displaystyle n\in \mathbb {N} } ) then x ≤ ≤ 0.

{\displaystyle x\leq 0.} [ 2 ] A topological vector space (TVS) that is an ordered vector space is necessarily Archimedean if its positive cone is closed.

[ 2 ] We say that a preordered vector space X {\displaystyle X} is regularly ordered and that its order is regular if it is Archimedean ordered and X + {\displaystyle X^{+}} distinguishes points in X .

{\displaystyle X.} [ 2 ] This property guarantees that there are sufficiently many positive linear forms to be able to successfully use the tools of duality to study ordered vector spaces.

[ 2 ] An ordered vector space is called a vector lattice if for all elements x {\displaystyle x} and y , {\displaystyle y,} the supremum sup ( x , y ) {\displaystyle \sup(x,y)} and infimum inf ( x , y ) {\displaystyle \inf(x,y)} exist.

[ 2 ] Subspaces, quotients, and products [ edit ] Throughout let X {\displaystyle X} be a preordered vector space with positive cone C .

{\displaystyle C.} Subspaces If M {\displaystyle M} is a vector subspace of X {\displaystyle X} then the canonical ordering on M {\displaystyle M} induced by X {\displaystyle X} 's positive cone C {\displaystyle C} is the partial order induced by the pointed convex cone C ∩ ∩ M , {\displaystyle C\cap M,} where this cone is proper if C {\displaystyle C} is proper.

[ 2 ] Quotient space Let M {\displaystyle M} be a vector subspace of an ordered vector space X , {\displaystyle X,} π π : X → → X / M {\displaystyle \pi :X\to X/M} be the canonical projection, and let C ^ ^ := π π ( C ) .

{\displaystyle {\hat {C}}:=\pi (C).} Then C ^ ^ {\displaystyle {\hat {C}}} is a cone in X / M {\displaystyle X/M} that induces a canonical preordering on the quotient space X / M .

{\displaystyle X/M.} If C ^ ^ {\displaystyle {\hat {C}}} is a proper cone in X / M {\displaystyle X/M} then C ^ ^ {\displaystyle {\hat {C}}} makes X / M {\displaystyle X/M} into an ordered vector space.

[ 2 ] If M {\displaystyle M} is C {\displaystyle C} -saturated then C ^ ^ {\displaystyle {\hat {C}}} defines the canonical order of X / M .

{\displaystyle X/M.} [ 1 ] Note that X = R 0 2 {\displaystyle X=\mathbb {R} _{0}^{2}} provides an example of an ordered vector space where π π ( C ) {\displaystyle \pi (C)} is not a proper cone.

If X {\displaystyle X} is also a topological vector space (TVS) and if for each neighborhood V {\displaystyle V} of the origin in X {\displaystyle X} there exists a neighborhood U {\displaystyle U} of the origin such that [ ( U + N ) ∩ ∩ C ] ⊆ ⊆ V + N {\displaystyle [(U+N)\cap C]\subseteq V+N} then C ^ ^ {\displaystyle {\hat {C}}} is a normal cone for the quotient topology .

[ 1 ] If X {\displaystyle X} is a topological vector lattice and M {\displaystyle M} is a closed solid sublattice of X {\displaystyle X} then X / L {\displaystyle X/L} is also a topological vector lattice.

[ 1 ] Product If S {\displaystyle S} is any set then the space X S {\displaystyle X^{S}} of all functions from S {\displaystyle S} into X {\displaystyle X} is canonically ordered by the proper cone { f ∈ ∈ X S : f ( s ) ∈ ∈ C for all s ∈ ∈ S } .

{\displaystyle \left\{f\in X^{S}:f(s)\in C{\text{ for all }}s\in S\right\}.} [ 2 ] Suppose that { X α α : α α ∈ ∈ A } {\displaystyle \left\{X_{\alpha }:\alpha \in A\right\}} is a family of preordered vector spaces and that the positive cone of X α α {\displaystyle X_{\alpha }} is C α α .

{\displaystyle C_{\alpha }.} Then C := ∏ ∏ α α C α α {\textstyle C:=\prod _{\alpha }C_{\alpha }} is a pointed convex cone in ∏ ∏ α α X α α , {\textstyle \prod _{\alpha }X_{\alpha },} which determines a canonical ordering on ∏ ∏ α α X α α ; {\textstyle \prod _{\alpha }X_{\alpha };} C {\displaystyle C} is a proper cone if all C α α {\displaystyle C_{\alpha }} are proper cones.

[ 2 ] Algebraic direct sum The algebraic direct sum ⨁ ⨁ α α X α α {\textstyle \bigoplus _{\alpha }X_{\alpha }} of { X α α : α α ∈ ∈ A } {\displaystyle \left\{X_{\alpha }:\alpha \in A\right\}} is a vector subspace of ∏ ∏ α α X α α {\textstyle \prod _{\alpha }X_{\alpha }} that is given the canonical subspace ordering inherited from ∏ ∏ α α X α α .

{\textstyle \prod _{\alpha }X_{\alpha }.} [ 2 ] If X 1 , … … , X n {\displaystyle X_{1},\dots ,X_{n}} are ordered vector subspaces of an ordered vector space X {\displaystyle X} then X {\displaystyle X} is the ordered direct sum of these subspaces if the canonical algebraic isomorphism of X {\displaystyle X} onto ∏ ∏ α α X α α {\displaystyle \prod _{\alpha }X_{\alpha }} (with the canonical product order) is an order isomorphism .

[ 2 ] Examples [ edit ] The real numbers with the usual ordering form a totally ordered vector space. For all integers n ≥ ≥ 0 , {\displaystyle n\geq 0,} the Euclidean space R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} considered as a vector space over the reals with the lexicographic ordering forms a preordered vector space whose order is Archimedean if and only if n = 1 {\displaystyle n=1} .

[ 4 ] R 2 {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{2}} is an ordered vector space with the ≤ ≤ {\displaystyle \,\leq \,} relation defined in any of the following ways (in order of increasing strength, that is, decreasing sets of pairs): Lexicographical order : ( a , b ) ≤ ≤ ( c , d ) {\displaystyle (a,b)\leq (c,d)} if and only if a < c {\displaystyle a<c} or ( a = c and b ≤ ≤ d ) .

{\displaystyle (a=c{\text{ and }}b\leq d).} This is a total order . The positive cone is given by x > 0 {\displaystyle x>0} or ( x = 0 and y ≥ ≥ 0 ) , {\displaystyle (x=0{\text{ and }}y\geq 0),} that is, in polar coordinates , the set of points with  the angular coordinate satisfying − − π π / 2 < θ θ ≤ ≤ π π / 2 , {\displaystyle -\pi /2<\theta \leq \pi /2,} together with the origin.

( a , b ) ≤ ≤ ( c , d ) {\displaystyle (a,b)\leq (c,d)} if and only if a ≤ ≤ c {\displaystyle a\leq c} and b ≤ ≤ d {\displaystyle b\leq d} (the product order of two copies of R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } with ≤ ≤ {\displaystyle \leq } ). This is a partial order. The positive cone is given by x ≥ ≥ 0 {\displaystyle x\geq 0} and y ≥ ≥ 0 , {\displaystyle y\geq 0,} that is, in polar coordinates 0 ≤ ≤ θ θ ≤ ≤ π π / 2 , {\displaystyle 0\leq \theta \leq \pi /2,} together with the origin.

( a , b ) ≤ ≤ ( c , d ) {\displaystyle (a,b)\leq (c,d)} if and only if ( a < c and b < d ) {\displaystyle (a<c{\text{ and }}b<d)} or ( a = c and b = d ) {\displaystyle (a=c{\text{ and }}b=d)} (the reflexive closure of the direct product of two copies of R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } with "<"). This is also a partial order. The positive cone is given by ( x > 0 and y > 0 ) {\displaystyle (x>0{\text{ and }}y>0)} or x = y = 0 ) , {\displaystyle x=y=0),} that is, in polar coordinates, 0 < θ θ < π π / 2 , {\displaystyle 0<\theta <\pi /2,} together with the origin.

Only the second order is, as a subset of R 4 , {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{4},} closed; see partial orders in topological spaces .

For the third order the two-dimensional " intervals " p < x < q {\displaystyle p<x<q} are open sets which generate the topology.

R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} is an ordered vector space with the ≤ ≤ {\displaystyle \,\leq \,} relation defined similarly. For example, for the second order mentioned above: x ≤ ≤ y {\displaystyle x\leq y} if and only if x i ≤ ≤ y i {\displaystyle x_{i}\leq y_{i}} for i = 1 , … … , n .

{\displaystyle i=1,\dots ,n.} A Riesz space is an ordered vector space where the order gives rise to a lattice .

The space of continuous functions on [ 0 , 1 ] {\displaystyle [0,1]} where f ≤ ≤ g {\displaystyle f\leq g} if and only if f ( x ) ≤ ≤ g ( x ) {\displaystyle f(x)\leq g(x)} for all x {\displaystyle x} in [ 0 , 1 ] .

{\displaystyle [0,1].} Let Sym n ( R ) {\displaystyle {\mbox{Sym}}_{n}(\mathbb {R} )} denote the symmetric n × × n {\displaystyle n\times n} matrices with real entries. The Loewner order ≼ ≼ {\displaystyle \preccurlyeq } on two symmetric matrices A , B ∈ ∈ Sym n ( R ) {\displaystyle A,B\in {\mbox{Sym}}_{n}(\mathbb {R} )} is defined by A ≼ ≼ B ⇔ ⇔ B − − A {\displaystyle A\preccurlyeq B\Leftrightarrow B-A} is positive semi-definite . Its positive cone is, by definition, the set of all positive definite matrices. Furthermore, the spectral theorem applied to symmetric matrices establishes that this cone is generating.

Pointwise order [ edit ] If S {\displaystyle S} is any set and if X {\displaystyle X} is a vector space (over the reals) of real-valued functions on S , {\displaystyle S,} then the pointwise order on X {\displaystyle X} is given by, for all f , g ∈ ∈ X , {\displaystyle f,g\in X,} f ≤ ≤ g {\displaystyle f\leq g} if and only if f ( s ) ≤ ≤ g ( s ) {\displaystyle f(s)\leq g(s)} for all s ∈ ∈ S .

{\displaystyle s\in S.} [ 4 ] Spaces that are typically assigned this order include: the space ℓ ℓ ∞ ∞ ( S , R ) {\displaystyle \ell ^{\infty }(S,\mathbb {R} )} of bounded real-valued maps on S .

{\displaystyle S.} the space c 0 ( R ) {\displaystyle c_{0}(\mathbb {R} )} of real-valued sequences that converge to 0.

{\displaystyle 0.} the space C ( S , R ) {\displaystyle C(S,\mathbb {R} )} of continuous real-valued functions on a topological space S .

{\displaystyle S.} for any non-negative integer n , {\displaystyle n,} the Euclidean space R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} when considered as the space C ( { 1 , … … , n } , R ) {\displaystyle C(\{1,\dots ,n\},\mathbb {R} )} where S = { 1 , … … , n } {\displaystyle S=\{1,\dots ,n\}} is given the discrete topology .

The space L ∞ ∞ ( R , R ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}^{\infty }(\mathbb {R} ,\mathbb {R} )} of all measurable almost-everywhere bounded real-valued maps on R , {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ,} where the preorder is defined for all f , g ∈ ∈ L ∞ ∞ ( R , R ) {\displaystyle f,g\in {\mathcal {L}}^{\infty }(\mathbb {R} ,\mathbb {R} )} by f ≤ ≤ g {\displaystyle f\leq g} if and only if f ( s ) ≤ ≤ g ( s ) {\displaystyle f(s)\leq g(s)} almost everywhere.
