( April 2021 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) In general relativity , specifically in the Einstein field equations , a spacetime is said to be stationary if it admits a Killing vector that is asymptotically timelike .

[ 1 ] Description and analysis [ edit ] In a stationary spacetime, the metric tensor components, g μ μ ν ν {\displaystyle g_{\mu \nu }} , may be chosen so that they are all independent of the time coordinate. The line element of a stationary spacetime has the form ( i , j = 1 , 2 , 3 ) {\displaystyle (i,j=1,2,3)} d s 2 = λ λ ( d t − − ω ω i d y i ) 2 − − λ λ − − 1 h i j d y i d y j , {\displaystyle ds^{2}=\lambda (dt-\omega _{i}\,dy^{i})^{2}-\lambda ^{-1}h_{ij}\,dy^{i}\,dy^{j},} where t {\displaystyle t} is the time coordinate, y i {\displaystyle y^{i}} are the three spatial coordinates and h i j {\displaystyle h_{ij}} is the metric tensor of 3-dimensional space. In this coordinate system the Killing vector field ξ ξ μ μ {\displaystyle \xi ^{\mu }} has the components ξ ξ μ μ = ( 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 ) {\displaystyle \xi ^{\mu }=(1,0,0,0)} .

λ λ {\displaystyle \lambda } is a positive scalar representing the norm of the Killing vector, i.e., λ λ = g μ μ ν ν ξ ξ μ μ ξ ξ ν ν {\displaystyle \lambda =g_{\mu \nu }\xi ^{\mu }\xi ^{\nu }} , and ω ω i {\displaystyle \omega _{i}} is a 3-vector, called the twist vector, which vanishes when the Killing vector is hypersurface orthogonal. The latter arises as the spatial components of the twist 4-vector ω ω μ μ = e μ μ ν ν ρ ρ σ σ ξ ξ ν ν ∇ ∇ ρ ρ ξ ξ σ σ {\displaystyle \omega _{\mu }=e_{\mu \nu \rho \sigma }\xi ^{\nu }\nabla ^{\rho }\xi ^{\sigma }} (see, for example, [ 2 ] p. 163) which is orthogonal to the Killing vector ξ ξ μ μ {\displaystyle \xi ^{\mu }} , i.e., satisfies ω ω μ μ ξ ξ μ μ = 0 {\displaystyle \omega _{\mu }\xi ^{\mu }=0} . The twist vector measures the extent to which the Killing vector fails to be orthogonal to a family of 3-surfaces. A non-zero twist indicates the presence of rotation in the spacetime geometry.

The coordinate representation described above has an interesting geometrical interpretation.

[ 3 ] The time translation Killing vector generates a one-parameter group of motion G {\displaystyle G} in the spacetime M {\displaystyle M} . By identifying the spacetime points that lie on a particular trajectory (also called orbit) one gets a 3-dimensional space (the manifold of Killing trajectories) V = M / G {\displaystyle V=M/G} , the quotient space.  Each point of V {\displaystyle V} represents a trajectory in  the spacetime M {\displaystyle M} . This identification, called a canonical projection, π π : M → → V {\displaystyle \pi :M\rightarrow V} is a mapping that sends each trajectory in M {\displaystyle M} onto a point in V {\displaystyle V} and induces a metric h = − − λ λ π π ∗ ∗ g {\displaystyle h=-\lambda \pi *g} on V {\displaystyle V} via pullback. The quantities λ λ {\displaystyle \lambda } , ω ω i {\displaystyle \omega _{i}} and h i j {\displaystyle h_{ij}} are all fields on V {\displaystyle V} and are consequently independent of time.  Thus, the geometry of a stationary spacetime does not change in time. In the special case ω ω i = 0 {\displaystyle \omega _{i}=0} the spacetime is said to be static . By definition, every static spacetime is stationary, but the converse is not generally true, as the Kerr metric provides a counterexample.

Use as starting point for vacuum field equations [ edit ] In a stationary spacetime satisfying the vacuum Einstein equations R μ μ ν ν = 0 {\displaystyle R_{\mu \nu }=0} outside the sources, the twist 4-vector ω ω μ μ {\displaystyle \omega _{\mu }} is curl-free, ∇ ∇ μ μ ω ω ν ν − − ∇ ∇ ν ν ω ω μ μ = 0 , {\displaystyle \nabla _{\mu }\omega _{\nu }-\nabla _{\nu }\omega _{\mu }=0,\,} and is therefore locally the gradient of a scalar ω ω {\displaystyle \omega } (called the twist scalar): ω ω μ μ = ∇ ∇ μ μ ω ω .

{\displaystyle \omega _{\mu }=\nabla _{\mu }\omega .\,} Instead of the scalars λ λ {\displaystyle \lambda } and ω ω {\displaystyle \omega } it is more convenient to use the two Hansen potentials, the mass and angular momentum potentials, Φ Φ M {\displaystyle \Phi _{M}} and Φ Φ J {\displaystyle \Phi _{J}} , defined as [ 4 ] Φ Φ M = 1 4 λ λ − − 1 ( λ λ 2 + ω ω 2 − − 1 ) , {\displaystyle \Phi _{M}={\frac {1}{4}}\lambda ^{-1}(\lambda ^{2}+\omega ^{2}-1),} Φ Φ J = 1 2 λ λ − − 1 ω ω .

{\displaystyle \Phi _{J}={\frac {1}{2}}\lambda ^{-1}\omega .} In general relativity the mass potential Φ Φ M {\displaystyle \Phi _{M}} plays the role of the Newtonian gravitational potential. A nontrivial angular momentum potential Φ Φ J {\displaystyle \Phi _{J}} arises for rotating sources due to the rotational kinetic energy which, because of mass–energy equivalence, can also act as the source of a gravitational field. The situation is analogous to a static electromagnetic field where one has two sets of potentials, electric and magnetic.  In general relativity, rotating sources produce a gravitomagnetic field that has no Newtonian analog.

A stationary vacuum metric is thus expressible in terms of the Hansen potentials Φ Φ A {\displaystyle \Phi _{A}} ( A = M {\displaystyle A=M} , J {\displaystyle J} ) and the 3-metric h i j {\displaystyle h_{ij}} . In terms of these quantities the Einstein vacuum field equations can be put in the form [ 4 ] ( h i j ∇ ∇ i ∇ ∇ j − − 2 R ( 3 ) ) Φ Φ A = 0 , {\displaystyle (h^{ij}\nabla _{i}\nabla _{j}-2R^{(3)})\Phi _{A}=0,\,} R i j ( 3 ) = 2 [ ∇ ∇ i Φ Φ A ∇ ∇ j Φ Φ A − − ( 1 + 4 Φ Φ 2 ) − − 1 ∇ ∇ i Φ Φ 2 ∇ ∇ j Φ Φ 2 ] , {\displaystyle R_{ij}^{(3)}=2[\nabla _{i}\Phi _{A}\nabla _{j}\Phi _{A}-(1+4\Phi ^{2})^{-1}\nabla _{i}\Phi ^{2}\nabla _{j}\Phi ^{2}],} where Φ Φ 2 = Φ Φ A Φ Φ A = ( Φ Φ M 2 + Φ Φ J 2 ) {\displaystyle \Phi ^{2}=\Phi _{A}\Phi _{A}=(\Phi _{M}^{2}+\Phi _{J}^{2})} , and R i j ( 3 ) {\displaystyle R_{ij}^{(3)}} is the Ricci tensor of the spatial metric and R ( 3 ) = h i j R i j ( 3 ) {\displaystyle R^{(3)}=h^{ij}R_{ij}^{(3)}} the corresponding Ricci scalar.  These equations form the starting point for investigating exact stationary vacuum metrics.
