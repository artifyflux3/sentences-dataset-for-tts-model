Bob Scalise, Harvard's former athletic director, became the first head coach in program history and led Harvard to a 106–34–14 record during his ten seasons. This included three Ivy titles and one tournament quarterfinal appearance. His last season as coach was in 1986.

Following Bob Scalise's retirement, Tim Wheaton took over the Crimson for 18 seasons, recording a 156–95–45 record. During those 18 seasons, he led Harvard to four Ivy League titles, seven NCAA appearances, and reached the quarterfinals twice.

Harvard then went through two coaches who each served for one year. In 2005, Stephanie Erickson led the Crimson to an 8–5–3 record, and the following year, Erika Walsh went 3–13–1.

In 2007, Ray Leone took over the Crimson and went 90–49–18 before accepting a job at Maryland in 2016.

The current head coach is Chris Hamblin, who started in 2016 and has gone 81–34–17. He has led Harvard to one Ivy League Championship and four NCAA appearances, including reaching the Round of 16 twice. He also won the first Ivy League Conference Tournament in 2023 by defeating Columbia 3–0.
