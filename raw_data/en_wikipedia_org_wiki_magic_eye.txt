( September 2023 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Cover of the first book Magic Eye is a series of books that feature autostereograms .

After creating its first images in 1991, creator Tom Baccei worked with Tenyo, a Japanese company that sells magic supplies.

Tenyo published its first book in late 1991 titled Miru Miru Mega Yokunaru Magic Eye ("Your Eyesight Gets Better & Better in a Very Short Rate of Time: Magic Eye"), sending sales representatives out to street corners to demonstrate how to see the hidden image. Within a few weeks the first Japanese book became a best seller, as did the second, rushed out shortly after.

[ 3 ] [ failed verification ] Magic Eye stereograms have been used by orthoptists and vision therapists in the treatment of some binocular vision and accommodative disorders.
