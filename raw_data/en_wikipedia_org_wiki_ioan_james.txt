H. C. Whitehead Doctoral students Jim Stasheff Wilson Sutherland Michael J. Hopkins Ioan Mackenzie James FRS (23 May 1928 – 21 February 2025) was a British mathematician working in the field of topology , particularly in homotopy theory .

Life and career [ edit ] James was born in Croydon , Surrey , England , [ 2 ] and was educated at St Paul's School, London and Queen's College, Oxford . In 1953 he earned a D. Phil.

from the University of Oxford for his thesis entitled Some problems in algebraic topology , written under the direction of J. H. C. Whitehead .

In 1957 he was appointed reader in pure mathematics, a post which he held until 1969. From 1959 until 1969 he was a senior research fellow at St John's College, Oxford. He held the Savilian Chair of Geometry at the University of Oxford from 1970 to 1995. He was a professor emeritus , and later an honorary fellow of St John's.

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1968.

[ 3 ] In 1978 the London Mathematical Society awarded him the Senior Whitehead Prize , [ 4 ] which was established in honour of his doctoral supervisor, Whitehead. In 1984 he became President of the London Mathematical Society .

James married Rosemary Stewart , a writer and researcher in business management and healthcare management, in 1961. She died in 2015, aged 90.
