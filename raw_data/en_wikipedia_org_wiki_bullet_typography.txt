In [typography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typography "Typography"), a **bullet** or **bullet point**, •, is a typographical symbol or [glyph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyph "Glyph") used to introduce items in a [list](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/list "wiktionary:list"). For example:

*   Milk
*   Eggs
*   Bread
*   Butter

The bullet symbol may take any of a variety of shapes, such as circular, square, diamond or arrow. Typical [word processor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_processor "Word processor") software offers a wide selection of shapes and colors. Several regular symbols, such as * ([asterisk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk "Asterisk")), - ([hyphen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen "Hyphen")), . ([period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop "Full stop")), and even o (lowercase Latin letter [O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O "O")), are conventionally used in [ASCII-only text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII-only_text "ASCII-only text") or other environments where bullet characters are not available. Historically, the [index symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_(typography) "Index (typography)")☞ (representing a hand with a pointing index finger) was popular for similar uses.

Lists made with bullets are called **bulleted lists**. The [HTML element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_element "HTML element") name for a bulleted list is "[unordered list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unordered_list "Unordered list")", because the list items are not arranged in numerical order (as they would be in a [numbered list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numbered_list "Numbered list")).

Items—known as "bullet points"—may be short phrases, single sentences, or of [paragraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paragraph "Paragraph") length.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_(typography)#cite_note-1) Bulleted items are not usually terminated with a [full stop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop "Full stop") unless they are complete sentences. In some cases, however, the [style guide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_guide "Style guide") for a given publication may call for every item except the last one in each bulleted list to be terminated with a [semicolon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon "Semicolon"), and the last item with a full stop. It is correct to terminate any bullet point with a full stop if the text within that item consists of one full sentence or more. Bullet points are usually used to highlight list elements.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_(typography)#cite_note-2)

The 1950 _New York News_ Type Book is credited as the first style guide to include a defined use for bullets. The Type Book described it as a typographic device to be used as an "Accessory" alongside asterisks, checks, and other marks available to people making advertisements for the _News_. The book "neither discusses the function of bullets in advertisements nor distinguishes them from any of the other items in the 'accessories' category", but can be seen to use them as a form of [dinkus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinkus "Dinkus") in an advertising panel.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_(typography)#cite_note-3)

**Example:** "Bullets are often used in technical writing, reference works, notes, and presentations". This statement may be presented using bullets or other techniques.

Bullets are often used in:

*   Technical writing
*   Reference works
*   Notes
*   Presentations

Alternatives to bulleted lists are [numbered lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numbered_list "Numbered list") and [outlines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_(list) "Outline (list)") (lettered lists, hierarchical lists). They are used where either the order is important or to label the items for later referencing.

The bullet glyph is sometimes used as a way to hide passwords or confidential information in a practice known as password masking.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_(typography)#cite_note-4) For example, the credit card number `1234 5678 9876 4321` might be displayed as `•••• •••• •••• 4321`.

A variant, the **bullet operator** (U+2219∙BULLET OPERATOR) has a unicode code-point but its purpose does not appear to be documented.[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_(typography)#cite_note-5) The glyph was transposed into Unicode from the original [IBM PC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PC "IBM PC") character set, [Code page 437](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_page_437 "Code page 437"), where it had the code-point F9 16 (249 10).[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_(typography)#cite_note-Unicode_1996_437-6)

There have been different ways to encode bullet points in computer systems.

### In historical systems

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bullet_(typography)&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: In historical systems")]

Glyphs such as •, ◦ and their reversed variants ◘, ◙ became available in [text mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_mode "Text mode") since early [IBM PCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PC "IBM PC") with MDA–CGA–EGA [graphic adapters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_adapter "Graphic adapter"), because built-in [screen fonts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VGA-compatible_text_mode#Fonts "VGA-compatible text mode") contained such forms at code points 7–10. These were not true [characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(computing) "Character (computing)") because such points belong to the [C0 control codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C0_control_codes "C0 control codes") range; therefore, these glyphs required a special way to be placed on the screen (see [code page 437](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_page_437 "Code page 437") for discussion).

Prior to the widespread use of word processors, bullets were often denoted by an asterisk; several word processors automatically convert asterisks to bullets if used at the start of line. This notation was inherited by [Setext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setext "Setext") and [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki "Wiki") engines.

There are a variety of [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode "Unicode") bullet characters, including:

*   U+2022•BULLET (&bull;, &bullet;)
*   U+2023‣TRIANGULAR BULLET
*   U+2043⁃HYPHEN BULLET (&hybull;)
*   U+204C⁌BLACK LEFTWARDS BULLET
*   U+204D⁍BLACK RIGHTWARDS BULLET
*   U+2219∙BULLET OPERATOR for use in mathematical notation primarily as a [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product "Dot product") instead of [interpunct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpunct "Interpunct").
*   U+25CB○WHITE CIRCLE (&cir;)
*   U+25CF●BLACK CIRCLE
*   U+25D8◘INVERSE BULLET
*   U+25E6◦WHITE BULLET

*   U+29BE⦾CIRCLED WHITE BULLET (&olcir;)
*   U+29BF⦿CIRCLED BULLET (&ofcir;)
*   U+25C9◉FISHEYE used in Japan as a bullet, and called _tainome_

To create bulleted list items for a web page, the markup language [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML "HTML") provides the list tag `<li>`. The browser will display one bulleted list item for each item in an [unordered list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_element#Lists "HTML element").

When using the US keyboard, a bullet point character can be produced by pressing 7 on the [numpad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeric_keypad "Numeric keypad") while keeping Alt pressed.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_(typography)#cite_note-7)

When using the US keyboard, a bullet point character can be produced by pressing 8 while keeping Option(Alt) pressed.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_(typography)#cite_note-8)

To create bulleted list items for a document, the markup language [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX "LaTeX") provides the item tag `\item`. Each item tag inside an itemized list will generate one bulleted list item.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_(typography)#cite_note-9)

A list item on a wiki page is indicated using one or more leading asterisks in [wiki markup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki_markup "Wiki markup") as well as in many other [wikis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki "Wiki").[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_(typography)#cite_note-10)

### Other uses in computing

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bullet_(typography)&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Other uses in computing")]

The bullet is often used for separating menu items, usually in the footer menu. It is common, for example, to see it in website designs and in many [WordPress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress "WordPress") themes. It is also used by text editors, like [Microsoft Word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word "Microsoft Word"), to create lists.

1.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_(typography)#cite_ref-5)**Many sources suggest that it means [logical conjunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_conjunction "Logical conjunction"). In fact, the symbol ![Image 1: {\displaystyle \land }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d6823e5a222eb3ca49672818ac3d13ec607052c4) is the conventional one for this function. All the sources appear to derive from an earlier version of this Wikipedia page, where that assertion was made without adequate evidence.
