[ 1 ] The logarithmic profile of wind speeds is generally limited to the lowest 100 m of the atmosphere (i.e., the surface layer of the atmospheric boundary layer ). The rest of the atmosphere is composed of the remaining part of the PBL (up to around 1 km) and the troposphere or free atmosphere.  In the free atmosphere, geostrophic wind relationships should be used, instead.

Formulation [ edit ] The equation to estimate the mean wind speed ( u z {\displaystyle u_{z}} ) at height z {\displaystyle z} (meters) above the ground is: u z = u ∗ ∗ κ κ [ ln ⁡ ⁡ ( z − − d z 0 ) + ψ ψ ( z , z 0 , L ) ] {\displaystyle u_{z}={\frac {u_{*}}{\kappa }}\left[\ln \left({\frac {z-d}{z_{0}}}\right)+\psi (z,z_{0},L)\right]} where u ∗ ∗ {\displaystyle u_{*}} is the friction velocity (m s −1 ), κ κ {\displaystyle \kappa } is the Von Kármán constant (~0.41), d {\displaystyle d} is the zero plane displacement (in metres), z 0 {\displaystyle z_{0}} is the surface roughness (in meters), and ψ ψ {\displaystyle \psi } is a stability term where L {\displaystyle L} is the Obukhov length from Monin-Obukhov similarity theory . Under neutral stability conditions, z / L = 0 {\displaystyle z/L=0} and ψ ψ {\displaystyle \psi } drops out and the equation is simplified to, u z = u ∗ ∗ κ κ [ ln ⁡ ⁡ ( z − − d z 0 ) ] {\displaystyle u_{z}={\frac {u_{*}}{\kappa }}\left[\ln \left({\frac {z-d}{z_{0}}}\right)\right]} .

Zero-plane displacement ( d {\displaystyle d} ) is the height in meters above the ground at which zero mean wind speed is achieved as a result of flow obstacles such as trees or buildings.  This displacement can be approximated as 2 / 3 to 3 / 4 of the average height of the obstacles.

[ 2 ] For example, if estimating winds over a forest canopy of height 30 m, the zero-plane displacement could be estimated as d = 20 m.

Roughness length ( z 0 {\displaystyle z_{0}} ) is a corrective measure to account for the effect of the roughness of a surface on wind flow.  That is, the value of the roughness length depends on the terrain.  The exact value is subjective and references indicate a range of values, making it difficult to give definitive values. In most cases, references present a tabular format with the value of z 0 {\displaystyle z_{0}} given for certain terrain descriptions. For example, for very flat terrain (snow, desert) the roughness length may be in the range 0.001 to 0.005 m.

[ 2 ] Similarly, for open terrain (grassland) the typical range is 0.01-0.05 m.

[ 2 ] For cropland, and brush/forest the ranges are 0.1-0.25 m and 0.5-1.0 m respectively. When estimating wind loads on structures the terrains may be described as suburban or dense urban, for which the ranges are typically 0.1-0.5 m and 1-5 m respectively.

[ 2 ] In order to estimate the mean wind speed at one height ( z 2 {\displaystyle {{z}_{2}}} ) based on that at another ( z 1 {\displaystyle {{z}_{1}}} ), the formula would be rearranged, [ 2 ] u ( z 2 ) = u ( z 1 ) ln ⁡ ⁡ ( ( z 2 − − d ) / z 0 ) ln ⁡ ⁡ ( ( z 1 − − d ) / z 0 ) {\displaystyle u({{z}_{2}})=u({{z}_{1}}){\frac {\ln \left(({{z}_{2}}-d)/{{z}_{0}}\right)}{\ln \left(({{z}_{1}}-d)/{{z}_{0}}\right)}}} , where u ( z 1 ) {\displaystyle u({{z}_{1}})} is the mean wind speed at height z 1 {\displaystyle {{z}_{1}}} .

Limits [ edit ] The log wind profile is generally considered to be a more reliable estimator of mean wind speed  than the wind profile power law in the lowest 10–20 m of the planetary boundary layer. Between 20 m and 100 m both methods can produce reasonable predictions of mean wind speed in neutral atmospheric conditions. From 100 m to near the top of the atmospheric boundary layer the power law produces more accurate predictions of mean wind speed (assuming neutral atmospheric conditions).

[ 3 ] The neutral atmospheric stability assumption discussed above is reasonable when the hourly mean wind speed at a height of 10 m exceeds 10 m/s where turbulent mixing overpowers atmospheric instability.

[ 3 ] Applications [ edit ] Log wind profiles are generated and used in many atmospheric pollution dispersion models .
