( March 2016 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) In formal logic , nonfirstorderizability is the inability of a natural-language statement to be adequately captured by a formula of first-order logic .  Specifically, a statement is nonfirstorderizable if there is no formula of first-order logic which is true in a model if and only if the statement holds in that model. Nonfirstorderizable statements are sometimes presented as evidence that first-order logic is not adequate to capture the nuances of meaning in natural language.

The term was coined by George Boolos in his paper "To Be is to Be a Value of a Variable (or to Be Some Values of Some Variables)".

[ 1 ] Quine argued that such sentences call for second-order symbolization, which can be interpreted as plural quantification over the same domain as first-order quantifiers use, without postulation of distinct "second-order objects" ( properties , sets, etc.).

Examples [ edit ] Geach-Kaplan sentence [ edit ] A standard example is the Geach – Kaplan sentence : "Some critics admire only one another."
If Axy is understood to mean " x admires y ," and the universe of discourse is the set of all critics, then a reasonable translation of the sentence into second order logic is: ∃ ∃ X ( ( ∃ ∃ x ¬ ¬ X x ) ∧ ∧ ∃ ∃ x , y ( X x ∧ ∧ X y ∧ ∧ A x y ) ∧ ∧ ∀ ∀ x ∀ ∀ y ( X x ∧ ∧ A x y → → X y ) ) {\displaystyle \exists X{\big (}(\exists x\neg Xx)\land \exists x,y(Xx\land Xy\land Axy)\land \forall x\,\forall y(Xx\land Axy\rightarrow Xy){\big )}} In words, this states that there exists a collection of critics with the following properties: The collection forms a proper subclass of all the critics; it is inhabited (and thus non-empty) by a member that admires a critic that is also a member; and it is such that if any of its members admires anyone, then the latter is necessarily also a member.

That this formula has no first-order equivalent can be seen by turning it into a formula in the language of arithmetic. To this end, substitute the formula ( y = x + 1 ∨ ∨ x = y + 1 ) {\textstyle (y=x+1\lor x=y+1)} for Axy . This expresses that the two terms are successors of one another, in some way. The resulting proposition, ∃ ∃ X ( ( ∃ ∃ x ¬ ¬ X x ) ∧ ∧ ∃ ∃ x , y ( X x ∧ ∧ X y ∧ ∧ ( y = x + 1 ∨ ∨ x = y + 1 ) ) ∧ ∧ ∀ ∀ x ∀ ∀ y ( X x ∧ ∧ ( y = x + 1 ∨ ∨ x = y + 1 ) → → X y ) ) {\displaystyle \exists X{\big (}(\exists x\neg Xx)\land \exists x,y(Xx\land Xy\land (y=x+1\lor x=y+1))\land \forall x\,\forall y(Xx\land (y=x+1\lor x=y+1)\rightarrow Xy){\big )}} states that there is a set X with the following three properties: There is a number that does not belong to X , i.e.

X does not contain all numbers.

The set X is inhabited, and here this indeed immediately means there are at least two numbers in it.

If a number x belongs to X and if y is either x + 1 or x - 1 , then y also belongs to X .

Recall a model of a formal theory of arithmetic, such as first-order Peano arithmetic , is called standard if it only contains the familiar natural numbers as elements (i.e., 0, 1, 2, ...

). The model is called non-standard otherwise. The formula above is true only in non-standard models: In the standard model X would be a proper subset of all numbers that also would have to contain all available numbers ( 0, 1, 2, ...

), and so it fails. And then on the other hand, in every non-standard model there is a subset X satisfying the formula.

Let us now assume that there is a first-order rendering of the above formula called E . If ¬ ¬ E {\displaystyle \neg E} were added to the Peano axioms, it would mean that there were no non-standard models of the augmented axioms. However, the usual argument for the existence of non-standard models would still go through, proving that there are non-standard models after all. This is a contradiction, so we can conclude that no such formula E exists in first-order logic.

Finiteness of the domain [ edit ] There is no formula A in first-order logic with equality which is true of all and only models with finite domains. In other words, there is no first-order formula which can express "there is only a finite number of things".

This is implied by the compactness theorem as follows.

[ 2 ] Suppose there is a formula A which is true in all and only models with finite domains. We can express, for any positive integer n , the sentence "there are at least n elements in the domain". For a given n , call the formula expressing that there are at least n elements B n . For example, the formula B 3 is: ∃ ∃ x ∃ ∃ y ∃ ∃ z ( x ≠ ≠ y ∧ ∧ x ≠ ≠ z ∧ ∧ y ≠ ≠ z ) {\displaystyle \exists x\exists y\exists z(x\neq y\wedge x\neq z\wedge y\neq z)} which expresses that there are at least three distinct elements in the domain. Consider the infinite set of formulae A , B 2 , B 3 , B 4 , … … {\displaystyle A,B_{2},B_{3},B_{4},\ldots } Every finite subset of these formulae has a model: given a subset, find the greatest n for which the formula B n is in the subset. Then a model with a domain containing n elements will satisfy A (because the domain is finite) and all the B formulae in the subset. Applying the compactness theorem, the entire infinite set must also have a model. Because of what we assumed about A , the model must be finite. However, this model cannot be finite, because if the model has only m elements, it does not satisfy the formula B m+1 . This contradiction shows that there can be no formula A with the property we assumed.

Other examples [ edit ] The concept of identity cannot be defined in first-order languages, merely indiscernibility.

[ 3 ] The Archimedean property that may be used to identify the real numbers among the real closed fields .

The compactness theorem implies that graph connectivity cannot be expressed in first-order logic.
