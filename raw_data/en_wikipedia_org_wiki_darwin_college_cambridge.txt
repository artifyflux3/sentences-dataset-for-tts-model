Founded on 28 July 1964, Darwin was Cambridge University's first graduate-only college, and also the first to admit both men and women. The college is named after the family of Charles Darwin who previously owned some of the land, Newnham Grange , on which the college now stands.

The college has between 650 and 800 students, mostly studying for PhD or MPhil degrees with strengths in the sciences, humanities, and law. Darwin is the largest graduate college of Cambridge. Darwin's sister college at Oxford University is Wolfson College .

Members of Darwin College are termed Darwinians and alumni include British primatologist and anthropologist Jane Goodall , [ 4 ] [ 5 ] American conservationist Dian Fossey , Barbadian Governor-General Elliott Belgrave , Nobel Prize winner Elizabeth Blackburn , Nobel Prize winner Eric Maskin , Solicitor-General of the United States Paul Clement , Global Energy Prize winning scientist Thorsteinn I. Sigfusson , and Pulitzer Prize nominated neurosurgeon Paul Kalanithi .

History [ edit ] Main Building Darwin College Library from the millpond Silver Street Main courtyard A significant increase in the number of postgraduate students at Cambridge University in the post-war period led to a growing realisation that a graduate college was becoming a necessity. In 1963, three of the university's older colleges – Trinity College , St John's College , and Gonville and Caius College – announced their intention to jointly form a new, wholly graduate college. The college was established in 1964, located on the bank of the River Cam , opposite Queens' College . On 29 January 1965, the Privy Council gave formal approval to the college as an Approved Foundation. It received its Royal Charter as an independent college within the university in 1976.

The college is named after the Darwin family, Charles Darwin's second son, George Darwin , having owned some of the property which the college now occupies. He bought Newnham Grange, the oldest part of the college, in 1885, together with the adjacent building known as The Old Granary, and Small Island. (Newnham Grange was originally built in 1793 for the family of Patrick Beales, a local corn and coal merchant . It was extensively remodelled by George Darwin.) Following the death of George's son, Sir Charles Galton Darwin , in 1962, those concerned with the foundation of the new college learned that the property was to become available. Katherine, Lady Darwin, and her family were very receptive to the idea of their home becoming the nucleus of a new college, and to the suggestion that it should bear the family's name. Family portraits of the Darwin family are on loan to the college from the Darwin Heirloom Trust and can be found on the walls of several of the college's main rooms. In the book Period Piece: A Cambridge Childhood , the granddaughter of Charles Darwin, Gwen Raverat describes how she grew up at Newnham Grange.

[ 6 ] [ citation needed ] A commemorative book entitled Darwin College: A 50th Anniversary Portrait was commissioned and published by the college in 2014 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the founding of the college in 1964.

[ 7 ] Buildings [ edit ] Darwin College is known for its distinctive Georgian and Victorian architecture, gardens, and college site which is integrated into the nearby River Cam .

Located on Silver Street and Newnham Road , the college is also known for the Darwin College Bridges which connect the college grounds with the two islands of the college.

In 1966 the college acquired the Hermitage (a house built in the nineteenth century on the west side of Newnham Grange) from St John's College. Work to convert and extend the college's buildings was funded by the founding colleges and through substantial donations from the Rayne Foundation established by Sir Max Rayne , a Jewish businessman and philanthropist.

In 1994 Darwin College completed construction of a new library and study centre along the side of The Old Granary. The centre is built on a narrow strip of land alongside the millpond in Cambridge, and uses a structure of green oak and lime mortar brickwork. The building uses high-level automatically opening windows and a chimney to control natural ventilation.

In 2004, the college acquired the Malting House to accommodate 12 students. The Malting House is Grade II listed and its name reflects the original purpose of the building. The building was the home of the Malting House School , which experimented with radical ideas in education in the 1920s.

In 2010 the college acquired No 4 Newnham Terrace, the former Rectory for the Church of St Mary the Less, Cambridge (Little St Mary's) thereby finally establishing an entire boundary for the college from Queen's Bridge to Newnham Road and to the River Granta .  The long boundary returns to Queen's Bridge and is formed by the two islands in the middle of the river.

Academic profile [ edit ] Darwin College has particular strengths across a range of subjects and is particularly strong in the sciences , law , and humanities with the majority of the postgraduate students graduating with PhDs and MPhils in these academic subjects.

As a postgraduate college, Darwin College is not ranked in the Tompkins Table ranking of Cambridge colleges that provide undergraduate studies.

Student life [ edit ] Darwin College Dining Hall, Christmas 2011 Newnham Grange The college organises the annual prestigious Darwin Lecture Series, eight talks over eight weeks structured around a single theme (such as 'Power') examined from very different perspectives (scientific, humanities, arts), given by eminent speakers who are leading international authorities in their fields. The lectures have been hosted for over twenty-five years and form one of the key events in the Cambridge calendar. Most of the series of lectures have been published as books and the more recent series are also available as videos for free live-streaming and download.

[ 8 ] Past speakers at the Darwin Lecture Series have included Sir Walter Bodmer , Rose George , Andrew Fabian , and historian David Olusoga . The inaugural lecture was given by Karl Popper .

[ 9 ] The college has a 24-hour library and study centre overlooking the River Cam and provides extensive punting for its students.

In sports, Darwin College Boat Club is a popular student society at Darwin College, as well as Darwin College Football Club who play in the long established Cambridge University Association Football League (CUAFL), representing the only graduate college within CUAFL. The club plays throughout the year in and out of term.

The college has regular formal dinners with students and fellows and also holds annual May Balls during Cambridge's May Week . In 2023, Darwin College became the first University of Cambridge college to have a fully plant-based May Ball.

[ 10 ] [ 11 ] Every Darwinian is automatically a member of the Darwin College Student Association (DCSA). The DCSA committee comprises 20 students, organising events and parties, supporting societies, and helping students make the most of their time in Cambridge.

[ 12 ] The Darwin College University Challenge team achieved some success on University Challenge in the 2018-2019 season reaching the semi-finals of the competition led by captain Jason Golfinos.

[ 13 ] The college team reached the first-round of the 2020-21 season of University Challenge .
