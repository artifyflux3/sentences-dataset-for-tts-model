Some species within it were formerly classed as Alteromonas .

Shewanella consists of facultatively anaerobic Gram-negative rods, most of which are found in extreme aquatic habitats where the temperature is very low and the pressure is very high.

[ 2 ] Shewanella bacteria are a normal component of the surface flora of fish and are implicated in fish spoilage.

[ 3 ] Shewanella chilikensis is a species of the genus Shewanella commonly found in the marine sponges of Saint Martin's Island of the Bay of Bengal , Bangladesh .

[ 4 ] Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 is a widely used laboratory model to study anaerobic respiration of metals and other anaerobic extracellular electron acceptors, and for teaching about microbial electrogenesis and microbial fuel cells .

[ 5 ] Biochemical characteristics of Shewanella species [ edit ] Colony, morphological, physiological, and biochemical characteristics of Shewanella species are shown in the Table below.

[ 6 ] In the absence of oxygen, members of this genus possess capabilities allowing the use of a variety of other electron acceptors for respiration. These include thiosulfate, sulfite, or elemental sulfur, [ 7 ] as well as fumarate.

[ 8 ] Marine species have demonstrated an ability to use arsenic as an electron acceptor as well.

[ 9 ] Some members of this species, most notably Shewanella oneidensis , have the ability to respire through a wide range of metal species, including manganese, chromium, uranium, and iron.

[ 10 ] Reduction of iron and manganese through Shewanella respiration has been shown to involve extracellular electron transfer through the employment of bacterial nanowires , extensions of the outer membrane.

[ 11 ] Applications [ edit ] The discovery of some of the respiratory capabilities possessed by members of this genus has opened the door to possible applications for these bacteria. The metal-reducing capabilities can potentially be applied to bioremediation of uranium-contaminated groundwater, [ 12 ] with the reduced form of uranium produced being easier to remove from water than the more soluble uranium oxide . Scientists researching the creation of microbial fuel cells, designs that use bacteria to induce a current, have also made use of the metal reducing capabilities some species of Shewanella possess as a part of their metabolic repertoire.

[ 13 ] Significance [ edit ] One of the roles that the genus Shewanella has in the environment is bioremediation .

[ 14 ] Shewanella species have great metabolic versatility; they can reduce various electron acceptors.

[ 2 ] Some of the electron acceptors they use are toxic substances and heavy metals, which often become less toxic after being reduced.

[ 14 ] Examples of metals that Shewanella are capable of reducing and degrading include uranium, chromium, and iron.

[ 15 ] Its ability to decrease toxicity of various substances makes Shewanella a useful tool for bioremediation. Specifically, Shewanella oneidensis strain MR-1 is often used to clean up contaminated nuclear weapon manufacturing sites.

[ 15 ] Shewanella also contributes to the biogeochemical circulation of minerals.

[ 2 ] Members of this genus are widely distributed in aquatic habitats, from the deep sea to the shallow Antarctic Ocean.

[ 14 ] Its diverse habitats, coupled to its ability to reduce a variety of metals, makes the genus critical for the cycling of minerals.

[ 2 ] For instance, under aerobic conditions, various species of Shewanella are capable of oxidizing manganese.

[ 16 ] When conditions are changed, the same species can reduce the manganese oxide products.

[ 16 ] Hence, since Shewanella can both oxidize and reduce manganese, it is critical to the cycling of manganese.
