Electron is a two-stage small-lift launch vehicle built and operated by Rocket Lab . The rocket has been launched to orbit 67 times with 63 successes and four failures. A suborbital version of the rocket, HASTE, has been successfully launched three times.

The first flight, known as "It's a Test", launched on 25 May 2017. The mission failed due to a glitch in communication equipment on the ground. Successful follow-on missions, including "Still Testing", "It's Business Time" and "This One's For Pickering", delivered multiple small payloads to low Earth orbit . Flight 26 was the first Electron flight to attempt a full catch recovery using a mid-air helicopter catch. "Scout's Arrow" was the first suborbital launch of the rocket.

In July 2019, Rocket Lab expected to have launches every two weeks in 2020.

[ 1 ] In June 2020, with a new Electron launch vehicle built every 18 days, Rocket Lab was planning to deliver monthly launches for the remainder of 2020 and into 2021, including the company's first launch from Wallops LC-2 in 2023 and a mission to the Moon for NASA aboard Electron and Rocket Lab's spacecraft bus platform Photon in 2022.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] Electron experienced its first successful launch in January 2018, [ 6 ] and launched their first mission for NASA in December 2018.

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] Flight No.

After reaching an altitude of about 224 kilometres (139 mi) (planned 500 kilometres (310 mi) at 85° inclination ), [ 9 ] the telemetry feed to the range safety officer was lost and the rocket was destroyed by range safety officer .

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] Post-flight analysis determined the issue to be a simple ground software failure rather than a problem with the rocket.

[ 4 ] The ground software issue was found to be a contractor's failure to enable forward error correction on their hardware leading to data corruption.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] Rocket Lab made no changes to the Electron vehicle and instead implemented adjustment to procedures to prevent similar problems.

[ 12 ] The two Lemur-2 satellites were put into a circularized orbit by the new "Electron kick stage" which was not announced until after the launch.

[ 13 ] Between December 2017 and January 2018 the launch was delayed six times due to weather, orbital traffic, rocket, and range safety issues.

[ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] Put Lemur-2 payloads into 500 km (310 mi) high orbit at 85.0° inclination while the Dove Pioneer satellite was put into a 289 km (180 mi) x 533 km (331 mi).

The launch, originally planned for April 2018, had been delayed several times: to June/July after unusual behavior was identified in a motor controller during a wet dress rehearsal, [ 19 ] [ 22 ] by a few days after a ground tracking antenna issue in the Chatham Island tracking station [ 24 ] and indefinitely after another motor controller issue.

[ 25 ] [ 26 ] In October 2018, a nine-day launch window was announced starting 11 November 2018.

This mission also was the first guided, full telemetry re-entry of the Electron launch vehicle's first stage as part of Rocket Lab 's plans to re-use and re-fly rocket boosters in future missions. Recovery instrumentation on-board this flight included guidance and navigation hardware, including S-band telemetry and on-board flight computer systems, to live-gather data during the first stage's atmospheric re-entry , as well as a reaction control system to orient the booster.

[ 56 ] [ 57 ] After the launch Rocket Lab said that the reusability tests were successful.

The NRO competitively awarded the contract under the Rapid Acquisition of a Small Rocket (RASR) contract vehicle. RASR allows the NRO to explore new launch opportunities that can provide a streamlined, commercial approach for getting small satellites into space. For the second time, the Electron booster survived atmospheric re-entry.

Rocket Lab again said that their reusability test was successful.

[ 64 ] [ 65 ] Rocket Lab does not plan to do any recovery testing.

[ 65 ] Flight delayed due to COVID-19 .

[ 64 ] A launch attempt on 11 June 2020 was canceled due to bad weather.

[ 2 ] The 5 SuperDoves were part of Planet's Flock 4e.

[ 68 ] Flight failed during 2nd stage burn.

[ 69 ] [ 70 ] The issue was found to be a single faulty electrical connection that was not caught during preflight testing. The wiring was intermittently secure leading to increasing resistance causing heating and thermal expansion. This caused softening of potting compounds around the connection leading to a disconnect. The disconnect lead to power being cut from the electric turbopumps needed for the Rutherford engine leading the engine to be shut down.

[ 71 ] No changes were made to the vehicle but changes were made to "work instructions and quality signoffs".

[ 96 ] First of four 2021 launches to carry two BlackSky Global Gen 2 satellites.

[ 97 ] Second stage engine shut down early causing the mission to be lost, but Electron's first stage safely completed a successful splashdown under parachute. The investigation revealed that the second stage igniter fault induced an interference with the engine controller that caused the data signal corruption for the thrust vector control (TVC) system, straying the vehicle off course.

The first stage booster performed a soft ocean splashdown under parachute. For the first time, a helicopter tracked and observed Electron's descent in preparation for future missions which aim to use helicopters to intercept and capture returning launch vehicle boosters mid-air as they return to Earth under parachute. The launch vehicle also flew with an advanced parachute deployed from the first stage at a higher altitude then previous recovery attempts and an improved heat shield.
