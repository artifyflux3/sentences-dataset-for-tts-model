Founded in 1635, ELTE is one of the largest and most prestigious [ 5 ] public higher education institutions in Hungary. The 28,000 students at ELTE are organized into nine faculties, and into research institutes located throughout Budapest and on the scenic banks of the Danube . ELTE is affiliated with 5 Nobel laureates , as well as winners of the Wolf Prize , Fulkerson Prize and Abel Prize , the latest of which was Abel Prize winner László Lovász in 2021.

The predecessor of Eötvös Loránd University was founded in 1635 by Cardinal Péter Pázmány in Nagyszombat, Kingdom of Hungary (today Trnava , Slovakia) as a Catholic university for teaching theology and philosophy. In 1770, the university was transferred to Buda . It was named Royal University of Pest until 1873, then University of Budapest until 1921, when it was renamed Royal Hungarian Pázmány Péter University after its founder Péter Pázmány. The Faculty of Science started its autonomous life in 1949, when The Faculty of Theology was separated from the university (now Pázmány Péter Catholic University ). The university received its current name in 1950, after one of its most well-known physicists, Baron Loránd Eötvös .

History [ edit ] Seal of the university from 1880 The university was founded in 1635 in Nagyszombat, Kingdom of Hungary (today Trnava , Slovakia) by the archbishop and theologian Péter Pázmány . Leadership was given over to the Jesuits . Initially the university only had two faculties (Faculty of Arts and Faculty of Theology). The Faculty of Law was added in 1667 and the Faculty of Medicine was started in 1769. After the dissolution of the Jesuit order, the university was moved to Buda (today part of Budapest ) in 1777 in accordance with the intention of the founder. The university moved to its final location in Pest (now also part of Budapest) in 1784. The language of education was Latin until 1844, when Hungarian was introduced as an exclusive official language. Women have been allowed to enroll since 1895.

[ 6 ] Although several Hungarian universities opted for the new foundation model, Eötvös Loránd University remained state-owned.

[ 7 ] On 3 October 2023, a former student of the Faculty of Science , Ferenc Krausz was awarded Nobel Prize in Physics .

[ 8 ] Academic profile [ edit ] ELTE is Hungary's largest scientific establishment with 118 PhD programs at 17 doctoral schools, and also offers 38 bachelor's programs, 96 master's programs, and over 50 degree programs in foreign languages. The course credits awarded are transferable to  universities in Europe through the Bologna process.
