[ 1 ] [ 2 ] A common point of confusion is that while a complex line has complex dimension one over C (hence the term " line "), it has ordinary dimension two over the real numbers R , and is topologically equivalent to a real plane , not a real line.

[ 3 ] The " complex plane " commonly refers to the graphical representation of the complex line on the real plane, and is thus generally synonymous with the complex line, not the complex coordinate plane .
