[ 4 ] He became interested in astronomy when he was 7–8 years old, and had his first telescope when he was around 9–10 years old.

[ 1 ] Espenak earned a bachelor's degree in physics from Wagner College , Staten Island, where he worked in the planetarium .  His master's degree was from the University of Toledo , based on studies he did at Kitt Peak Observatory of eruptive and flare stars among red dwarfs .

[ 3 ] He provided NASA 's eclipse bulletins starting in 1978. He was the author of several canonical works on eclipse predictions, such as the Fifty Year Canon of Solar Eclipses: 1986–2035 and Fifty Year Canon of Lunar Eclipses: 1986–2035 , [ 1 ] both of which are standard references on eclipses.

[ 3 ] The first eclipse he saw was the solar eclipse of March 7, 1970 , which sparked his interest in eclipses, [ 3 ] and he eventually saw over 20 eclipses.

[ 1 ] Together with Jean Meeus , Espenak published the Five Millennium Canon of Solar Eclipses in 2006, which covers all types of solar eclipses (partial, total, annular, or hybrid) from 2000 BCE to 3000 CE, [ 6 ] and the Five Millennium Canon of Lunar Eclipses in 2009, which lists all lunar eclipses (penumbral, partial, or total) in that time span.

[ 7 ] Later, he published the more compact Thousand Year Canon of Lunar Eclipses 1501 to 2500 , [ 8 ] the Thousand Year Canon of Solar Eclipses 1501 to 2500 , [ 9 ] and the 21st Century Canon of Solar Eclipses .

[ 10 ] He was also a co-author (with Mark Littmann and Ken Willcox ) of Totality: Eclipses of the Sun .

[ 3 ] Espenak gave public lectures on eclipses and astrophotography. Astronomical photographs taken by him have been published in National Geographic , Newsweek , Nature , New Scientist , and Ciel et Espace [ fr ] magazines.

[ 12 ] He died on June 1, 2025, in hospice care at his home in Portal, Arizona . He was 71.
