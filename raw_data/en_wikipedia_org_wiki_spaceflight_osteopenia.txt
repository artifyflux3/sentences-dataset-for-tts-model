**Spaceflight osteopenia** refers to the characteristic [bone loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis "Osteoporosis") that occurs during [spaceflight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight "Spaceflight"). [Astronauts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut "Astronaut") lose an average of more than 1% bone mass per month spent in [space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_space "Outer space").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight_osteopenia#cite_note-1) There is concern that during [long-duration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-duration_spaceflight "Long-duration spaceflight") flights, excessive bone loss and the associated increase in serum [calcium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium "Calcium") ion levels will interfere with execution of mission tasks and result in irreversible [skeletal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal "Skeletal") damage.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight_osteopenia#cite_note-NASA-2)

Bone loss has been observed during spaceflight since at least as early as [Gemini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Gemini "Project Gemini") in the 1960s. Although most early measurements of the amount of bone loss were not reliable, they did show bone loss in Gemini, [Soyuz 9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_9 "Soyuz 9"), [Apollo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_program "Apollo program"), [Skylab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skylab "Skylab"), [Salyut 7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salyut_7 "Salyut 7"), [Mir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mir "Mir"), and the [International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station "International Space Station").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight_osteopenia#cite_note-3)[William E. Thornton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_E._Thornton "William E. Thornton"), an astronaut and physician, was one of the biggest proponents of exercise as a way of preventing bone loss.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight_osteopenia#cite_note-cavanagh-4)

[Bone remodels in response to stress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_remodeling "Bone remodeling") in order to maintain constant strain energy per bone mass throughout.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight_osteopenia#cite_note-Marzban-5) To do this, it grows more dense in areas experiencing high stress, while resorbing density in areas experiencing low stress. For example, on [Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars "Mars"), where gravity is about one-third that of earth, the gravitational forces acting on astronauts' bodies would be much lower, causing bones to decrease in mass and density.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight_osteopenia#cite_note-ACSM-6)

Average bone loss of 1–2% was recorded in astronauts on [Mir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mir "Mir") each month.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight_osteopenia#cite_note-NASA-2) This is in comparison to 1–1.5% bone loss in the elderly _per year_, and 2–3% in postmenopausal women.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight_osteopenia#cite_note-7)

Astronaut [Sunita "Suni" Williams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams "Sunita Williams") bungeed to the [TVIS treadmill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treadmill_with_Vibration_Isolation_Stabilization "Treadmill with Vibration Isolation Stabilization") aboard the [International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station "International Space Station").

Since Gemini, exercise has been tried as a way of preventing bone loss, but it has not been shown to be successful. This may be in part due to lack of adequately designed studies (no controlled study had been done as of 2005, either in space or using bedrest as an attempt to simulate conditions which lead to bone loss). It is not known whether a different exercise regiment (perhaps including larger loads than past ones) would be effective.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight_osteopenia#cite_note-cavanagh-4)

Bone is difficult to regain once it is lost. Data from immobilization studies and from patients with spinal cord injuries support this.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight_osteopenia#cite_note-8) Spaceflight data suggest this as well.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight_osteopenia#cite_note-9) This suggests that bone loss prevention over postflight bone recovery is an important factor in countermeasure success.

Increasing dietary [calcium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium "Calcium") and [vitamin D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D "Vitamin D") is a standard countermeasure for [osteoporosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis "Osteoporosis").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight_osteopenia#cite_note-cavanagh-4)[Clay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay "Clay") is reportedly used by NASA for retaining calcium.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight_osteopenia#cite_note-10)

A variety of drug remedies currently used or proposed for osteoporosis may work for spaceflight, including [hormone therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone_replacement_therapy_(menopause) "Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)") (estrogen or progestin), [selective estrogen receptor modulators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_estrogen_receptor_modulator "Selective estrogen receptor modulator"), [bisphosphonates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisphosphonate "Bisphosphonate"), [teriparatide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teriparatide "Teriparatide"), and others. Whether they can provide the same benefits for spaceflight as they do for osteoporosis is not yet known.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight_osteopenia#cite_note-cavanagh-4)
