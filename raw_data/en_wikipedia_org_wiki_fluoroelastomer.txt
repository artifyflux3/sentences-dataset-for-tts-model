Find sources: "Fluoroelastomer" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( June 2008 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) A fluoroelastomer is a fluorocarbon -based synthetic rubber . Fluoroelastomers generally have wide chemical resistance.

Composition [ edit ] Several compositions of fluoroelastomers exist including FKM (by ASTM D1418 standard, equivalent to FPM by ISO/DIN 1629 standard); perfluoro-elastomers ( FFKM ); and tetrafluoro ethylene/propylene rubbers ( FEPM ).

Performance [ edit ] The performance of fluoroelastomers in aggressive chemicals depends on the nature of the base polymer and the compounding ingredients used for moulding the final products (e.g. O-rings, shaft seals). This performance can vary significantly when end-users purchase polymer-containing rubber goods from different sources. Fluoroelastomers are generally compatible with hydrocarbons, but incompatible with ketones such as acetone and organic acids such as acetic acid .
