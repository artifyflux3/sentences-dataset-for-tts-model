( June 2021 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Opening ceremony on 12th Oct. 1929 Chongqing University was founded in 1929, when some professors born in Chongqing, working at Chengdu University, decided to found a new University in Chongqing. The university was founded with the help of General Liu Xiang , whose involvement resulted in the founding of the Chongqing University Preparatory Committee. On October 12, the first term of Chongqing University began, and the Chongqing University Preparatory Committee published the "Chongqing University Founding Declaration", which declared talents and education to be the driving force of the country and the world's development.

[ 7 ] In 1937, the Capital Nanjing was occupied. The Chinese government ordered that all agencies move to Chongqing and continue resisting Japanese aggression. This order resulted in the relocation of the National Central University to Chongqing, where it was gifted 200mu of land by the Chongqing University, and a cooperative relationship was established between the two universities. During this period, many distinguished professors taught at both universities, contributing significantly to the academic environment. These included notable figures such as Li Siguang , a renowned geologist; Xu Beihong , a famous painter and art educator; Wu Guanzhong , an accomplished painter and art educator; Ma Yinchu , an influential economist and educator; He Lu, a prominent physicist; and Lu Zuofu , a distinguished literary scholar. This era of collaboration not only strengthened the academic capabilities of both universities but also played a crucial role in preserving and advancing China's educational and cultural institutions amidst the challenges of war.

[ 8 ] In 1942, Chongqing University became a national comprehensive university consisting of six colleges in liberal arts, science, engineering, law, and medicine.

In 1952, the nationwide restructuring of higher education turned Chongqing University into an engineering-orientated multi-disciplinary university under the State Ministry of Education. In 1960, Chongqing University was designated as one of the first key national universities. Since the implementation of reform and opening-up policy in China, Chongqing University has stressed the development of disciplines like humanities, business management, art, and sports education, and has further sped up the process of developing the university into a comprehensive institution of higher learning.
