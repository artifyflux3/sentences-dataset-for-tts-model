Tanacetum parthenium , known as feverfew , [ 1 ] is a flowering plant in the daisy family, Asteraceae . It may be grown as an ornament , and may be identified by its synonyms, Chrysanthemum parthenium and Pyrethrum parthenium . Having its origin in the Balkans region, it is now distributed worldwide.

[ 2 ] Although long used in traditional medicine , there is no clinical evidence that it has any therapeutic effects.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] Description [ edit ] The plant is a herbaceous perennial that grows into a small bush, up to 70 cm (28 in) high, with pungently-scented leaves.

[ 3 ] The leaves are light yellowish green, variously pinnatifid . The conspicuous daisy-like flowers are up to 20 millimetres ( 3 ⁄ 4 in) across, borne in lax corymbs . The outer, ray florets have white ligules and the inner, disc florets are yellow and tubular. It spreads rapidly by seed, and will cover a wide area after a few years.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] The plant produces achene fruit, and grows in stony slopes and river beds.

[ 6 ] Location and cultivation [ edit ] Feverfew is native to Eurasia, specifically in the Balkans, Anatolia , and the Caucasus , but cultivation has spread it around the world.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] A perennial herb, it favors full sun 38 to 46 cm (15–18 in) apart. It grows up to 70 cm (28 in) tall. It is hardy to USDA zone 5 (−30 °C or −22 °F).

Outside of its native range, it may become an invasive weed .

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] Uses [ edit ] Leaf of feverfew The chemical structure of parthenolide Phytochemicals and traditional medicine [ edit ] Phytochemicals found in feverfew include parthenolide , camphor , and the flavonoids , luteolin , and apigenin .

[ 10 ] Feverfew has been used in traditional medicine, particularly in Europe, [ 11 ] where it is mentioned in an herbal monograph as a safe compound.

[ 12 ] There is no good evidence for its use in treating migraine headaches [ 13 ] or any other clinical condition.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] Dietary supplement [ edit ] The parthenolide content of commercially available feverfew supplements varies substantially (by more than 40-fold) despite labeling claims of "standardization".

[ 14 ] Adverse effects [ edit ] Long-term use of feverfew followed by abrupt discontinuation may induce a withdrawal syndrome featuring rebound headaches and muscle and joint pains.

[ 3 ] Feverfew may cause allergic reactions in those allergic to the daisy family, including contact dermatitis or swelling and numbness of the mouth.

[ 3 ] Other side effects have included gastrointestinal upset such as mild nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and flatulence, which are, fortunately mild and transient.

[ 3 ] When the herb is chewed or taken orally it may cause mouth ulcers .

[ 3 ] Feverfew should not be taken by pregnant women.

[ 3 ] It may interact with blood thinners and increase the risk of bleeding, and also may interact with a variety of medications metabolized by the liver.

[ 3 ] History and etymology [ edit ] The word feverfew possibly derives from a feathery plant known as featherfew .

[ 3 ] Although its earliest use is unknown, it was documented in the 1st century CE by the Greek herbalist physician Dioscorides .

[ 15 ] Much earlier, but less specifically, a text of Hippocrates in the 4th century BCE lists it as useful in treating lesions ( On Ulcers 14).
