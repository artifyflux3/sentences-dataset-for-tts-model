( May 2025 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) A free motion equation is a differential equation that describes a mechanical system in the absence of external forces, but in the presence only of an inertial force depending on the choice of a reference frame. 
In non-autonomous mechanics on a configuration space Q → → R {\displaystyle Q\to \mathbb {R} } , a free motion equation is defined as a second order non-autonomous dynamic equation on Q → → R {\displaystyle Q\to \mathbb {R} } which is brought into the form q ¯ ¯ t t i = 0 {\displaystyle {\overline {q}}_{tt}^{i}=0} with respect to some reference frame ( t , q ¯ ¯ i ) {\displaystyle (t,{\overline {q}}^{i})} on Q → → R {\displaystyle Q\to \mathbb {R} } . Given an arbitrary reference frame ( t , q i ) {\displaystyle (t,q^{i})} on Q → → R {\displaystyle Q\to \mathbb {R} } , a free motion equation reads q t t i = d t Γ Γ i + ∂ ∂ j Γ Γ i ( q t j − − Γ Γ j ) − − ∂ ∂ q i ∂ ∂ q ¯ ¯ m ∂ ∂ q ¯ ¯ m ∂ ∂ q j ∂ ∂ q k ( q t j − − Γ Γ j ) ( q t k − − Γ Γ k ) , {\displaystyle q_{tt}^{i}=d_{t}\Gamma ^{i}+\partial _{j}\Gamma ^{i}(q_{t}^{j}-\Gamma ^{j})-{\frac {\partial q^{i}}{\partial {\overline {q}}^{m}}}{\frac {\partial {\overline {q}}^{m}}{\partial q^{j}\partial q^{k}}}(q_{t}^{j}-\Gamma ^{j})(q_{t}^{k}-\Gamma ^{k}),} where Γ Γ i = ∂ ∂ t q i ( t , q ¯ ¯ j ) {\displaystyle \Gamma ^{i}=\partial _{t}q^{i}(t,{\overline {q}}^{j})} is a connection on Q → → R {\displaystyle Q\to \mathbb {R} } associates with the initial reference frame ( t , q ¯ ¯ i ) {\displaystyle (t,{\overline {q}}^{i})} . The right-hand side of this equation is treated as an inertial force .

A free motion equation need not exist in general. It can be defined if and only if a configuration bundle Q → → R {\displaystyle Q\to \mathbb {R} } of a mechanical system is a toroidal cylinder T m × × R k {\displaystyle T^{m}\times \mathbb {R} ^{k}} .
