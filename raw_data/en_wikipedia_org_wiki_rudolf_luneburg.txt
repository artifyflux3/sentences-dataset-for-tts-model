He was born in Germany , received his doctorate at Göttingen , and emigrated to the United States in 1935.

His work included an analysis of the geometry of visual space as expected from physiology and the assumption that the angle of vergence provides a constant measure of distance. From these premises he concluded that near field visual space is hyperbolic .
