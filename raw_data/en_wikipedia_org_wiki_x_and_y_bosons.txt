Since the X and Y boson mediate the grand unified force, they would have unusual high mass, which requires more energy to create than the reach of any current particle collider experiment. Significantly, the X and Y bosons couple quarks (constituents of protons and others) to leptons (such as positrons), allowing violation of the conservation of baryon number thus permitting proton decay .

However, the Hyper-Kamiokande has put a lower bound on the proton's half-life as around 10 34 years.

[ 2 ] Since some grand unified theories such as the Georgi–Glashow model predict a half-life less than this, the existence of X and Y bosons, as formulated by this particular model, remains hypothetical.

Details [ edit ] An X boson would have the following two decay modes : [ 1 ] : 442 X + → u L + u R X + → e + L + d R where the two decay products in each process have opposite chirality , u is an up quark , d is a down antiquark , and e + is a positron .

A Y boson would have the following three decay modes : [ 1 ] : 442 Y + → e + L + u R Y + → d L + u R Y + → d L + ν e R where u is an up antiquark and ν e is an electron antineutrino .

The first product of each decay has left-handed chirality and the second has right-handed chirality , which always produces one fermion with the same handedness that would be produced by the decay of a W boson , and one fermion with contrary handedness ("wrong handed").

Similar decay products exist for the other quark–lepton generations .

In these reactions, neither the lepton number ( L ) nor the baryon number ( B ) is separately conserved, but the combination B − L is. Different branching ratios between the X boson and its antiparticle (as is the case with the kaon ) would explain baryogenesis . For instance, if an X + / X − pair is created out of energy, and they follow the two branches described above: X + → u L + u R , X − → d L + e − R ; re-grouping the result ( u + u + d ) + e − = p + e − shows it to be a hydrogen atom.

Origin [ edit ] The X ± and Y ± bosons are defined respectively as the six Q = ± ⁠ 4 / 3 ⁠ and the six Q = ± ⁠ 1 / 3 ⁠ components of the final two terms of the adjoint 24 representation of SU(5) as it transforms under the standard model's group: 24 → → ( 8 , 1 ) 0 ⊕ ⊕ ( 1 , 3 ) 0 ⊕ ⊕ ( 1 , 1 ) 0 ⊕ ⊕ ( 3 , 2 ) − − 5 6 ⊕ ⊕ ( 3 ¯ ¯ , 2 ) 5 6 .

{\displaystyle \mathbf {24} \rightarrow (8,1)_{0}\oplus (1,3)_{0}\oplus (1,1)_{0}\oplus (3,2)_{-{\frac {5}{6}}}\oplus ({\bar {3}},2)_{\frac {5}{6}}.} The positively-charged X and Y carry anti- color charges (equivalent to having two different normal color charges), while the negatively-charged X and Y carry normal color charges , and the signs of the Y bosons' weak isospins are always opposite the signs of their electric charges . In terms of their action on C 5 , {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} ^{5},} X bosons rotate between a color index and the weak isospin -up index, while Y bosons rotate between a color index and the weak isospin -down index.
