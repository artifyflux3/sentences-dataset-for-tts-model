Find sources: "Velocity potential" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( May 2014 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) A velocity potential is a scalar potential used in potential flow theory. It was introduced by Joseph-Louis Lagrange in 1788.

[ 1 ] It is used in continuum mechanics , when a continuum occupies a simply-connected region and is irrotational . In such a case, ∇ ∇ × × u = 0 , {\displaystyle \nabla \times \mathbf {u} =0\,,} where u denotes the flow velocity . As a result, u can be represented as the gradient of a scalar function ϕ ϕ {\displaystyle \phi } : u = ∇ ∇ ϕ ϕ = ∂ ∂ ϕ ϕ ∂ ∂ x i + ∂ ∂ ϕ ϕ ∂ ∂ y j + ∂ ∂ ϕ ϕ ∂ ∂ z k .

{\displaystyle \mathbf {u} =\nabla \phi \ ={\frac {\partial \phi }{\partial x}}\mathbf {i} +{\frac {\partial \phi }{\partial y}}\mathbf {j} +{\frac {\partial \phi }{\partial z}}\mathbf {k} \,.} ϕ ϕ {\displaystyle \phi } is known as a velocity potential for u .

A velocity potential is not unique. If ϕ ϕ {\displaystyle \phi } is a velocity potential, then ϕ ϕ + f ( t ) {\displaystyle \phi +f(t)} is also a velocity potential for u , where f ( t ) {\displaystyle f(t)} is a scalar function of time and can be constant.  Velocity potentials are unique up to a constant, or a function solely of the temporal variable.

The Laplacian of a velocity potential is equal to the divergence of the corresponding flow. Hence if a velocity potential satisfies Laplace equation , the flow is incompressible .

Unlike a stream function , a velocity potential can exist in three-dimensional flow.

Usage in acoustics [ edit ] In theoretical acoustics , [ 2 ] it is often desirable to work with the acoustic wave equation of the velocity potential ϕ ϕ {\displaystyle \phi } instead of pressure p and/or particle velocity u .

∇ ∇ 2 ϕ ϕ − − 1 c 2 ∂ ∂ 2 ϕ ϕ ∂ ∂ t 2 = 0 {\displaystyle \nabla ^{2}\phi -{\frac {1}{c^{2}}}{\frac {\partial ^{2}\phi }{\partial t^{2}}}=0} Solving the wave equation for either p field or u field does not necessarily provide a simple answer for the other field. On the other hand, when ϕ ϕ {\displaystyle \phi } is solved for, not only is u found as given above, but p is also easily found—from the (linearised) Bernoulli equation for irrotational and unsteady flow —as p = − − ρ ρ ∂ ∂ ϕ ϕ ∂ ∂ t .

{\displaystyle p=-\rho {\frac {\partial \phi }{\partial t}}\,.} See also [ edit ] Vorticity Hamiltonian fluid mechanics Potential flow Potential flow around a circular cylinder Notes [ edit ] ^ Anderson, John (1998).
