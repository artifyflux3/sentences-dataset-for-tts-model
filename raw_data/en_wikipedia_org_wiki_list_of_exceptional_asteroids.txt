Deconvolved with MISTRAL algorithm. Main-belt asteroids > 200 km that were not imaged are (451) Patientia, (65) Cybele and (107) Camilla. Trojan (624) Hektor may also be in this size range.

VLT/SPHERE images of a large number of asteroids 100 to 210 km in diameter, to scale. (10) Hygiea, (31) Euphrosyne and (8) Flora have collisional families; all three are round due to having re-coalesced after being disrupted.

The following is a collection of lists of asteroids of the Solar System that are exceptional in some way, such as their size or orbit. For the purposes of this article, "asteroid" refers to minor planets out to the orbit of Neptune , and includes the dwarf planet Ceres , the Jupiter trojans and the centaurs , but not trans-Neptunian objects (objects in the Kuiper belt , scattered disc or inner Oort cloud ). For a complete list of minor planets in numerical order , see List of minor planets .

Asteroids are given minor planet numbers, but not all minor planets are asteroids. Minor planet numbers are also given to objects of the Kuiper belt , which is similar to the asteroid belt but farther out (around 30–60 AU), whereas asteroids are mostly between 2–3 AU from the Sun or at the orbit of Jupiter 5 AU from the Sun. Also, comets are not typically included under minor planet numbers, and have their own naming conventions .

Asteroids are given a unique sequential identifying number once their orbit is precisely determined. Prior to this, they are known only by their systematic name or provisional designation , such as 1950 DA .

Physical characteristics [ edit ] Largest by diameter [ edit ] Estimating the sizes of asteroids from observations is difficult due to their irregular shapes, varying albedo , and small angular diameter . Observations by the Very Large Telescope of most large asteroids were published 2019–2021.

Based on IRAS data there are about 140 main-belt asteroids with a diameter greater than 120 km, [ 6 ] which is approximately the transition point between surviving primordial asteroids and fragments thereof.

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] For a more complete list, see List of Solar System objects by size .

The inner asteroid belt (defined as the region interior to the 3:1 Kirkwood gap at 2.50 AU) has few large asteroids. Of those in the above list, only 4 Vesta , 19 Fortuna , 6 Hebe , 7 Iris and 9 Metis orbit there. (Sort table by mean distance.) Most massive [ edit ] Below are the sixteen most-massive measured asteroids.

[ 9 ] Ceres , at a third the estimated mass of the asteroid belt , is half again as massive as the next fifteen put together. The masses of asteroids are estimated from perturbations they induce on the orbits of other asteroids , except for asteroids that have been visited by spacecraft or have an observable moon, where a direct mass calculation is possible. Different sets of astrometric observations lead to different mass determinations; the biggest problem is accounting for the aggregate perturbations caused by all of the smaller asteroids .

[ 13 ] Outside the top four, the ranking of all the asteroids is uncertain, as there is a great deal of overlap among the estimates.

The largest asteroids with an accurately measured mass, because they have been studied by the probe Dawn , are 1 Ceres with a mass of (939.3 ± 0.5) × 10 18 kg , and 4 Vesta at (259.076 ± 0.001) × 10 18 kg . The third-largest asteroid with an accurately measured mass, because it has moons, is 87 Sylvia at (14.76 ± 0.06) × 10 18 kg . Other large asteroids with masses measured from their moons are 107 Camilla and 130 Elektra .

[ 3 ] [ 14 ] [ 1 ] For a more complete list, see List of Solar System objects by size . Other large asteroids such as 423 Diotima currently only have estimated masses.

[ 15 ] [ 16 ] Brightest from Earth [ edit ] Only Vesta is regularly bright enough to be seen with the naked eye. Under ideal viewing conditions with very dark skies, a keen eye might be able to also see Ceres, as well as Pallas and Iris at their rare perihelic oppositions.

[ 17 ] The following asteroids can all reach an apparent magnitude brighter than or equal to the +8.3 attained by Saturn 's moon Titan at its brightest, which was discovered 145 years before the first asteroid was found owing to its closeness to the easily observed Saturn.

None of the asteroids in the outer part of the asteroid belt can ever attain this brightness. Even Hygiea and Interamnia rarely reach magnitudes of above 10.0. This is due to the different distributions of spectral types within different sections of the asteroid belt: the highest-albedo asteroids are all concentrated closer to the orbit of Mars , and much lower albedo C and D types are common in the outer belt.

Those asteroids with very high eccentricities will only reach their maximum magnitude rarely, when their perihelion is very close to a heliocentric conjunction with Earth, or (in the cases of 433 Eros , 99942 Apophis , (152680) 1998 KJ 9 , (153814) 2001 WN 5 , and 367943 Duende ) when the asteroid passes very close to Earth.

As of March 2018 [update] , of the near-800,000 minor planets known, there are only 99 known retrograde minor planets (0.01% of total minor planets known).

[ 20 ] In comparison, there are over 2,000 comets with retrograde orbits. This makes retrograde minor planets the rarest group of all. High-inclination asteroids are either Mars-crossers (possibly in the process of being ejected from the Solar System) or damocloids . Some of these are temporarily captured in retrograde resonance with the gas giants.

Note there are several cases where a non-numbered minor planets turned out to be a comet , e.g.

C/2001 OG108 (LONEOS) , which was provisionally designated 2001 OG 108 .

Minor planets that were misnamed and renamed [ edit ] In earlier times, before the modern numbering and naming rules were in effect, asteroids were sometimes given numbers and names before their orbits were precisely known. And in a few cases duplicate names were given to the same object (with modern use of computers to calculate and compare orbits with old recorded positions, this type of error no longer occurs). This led to a few cases where asteroids had to be renamed.

[ 27 ] Minor planet name Description 330 Adalberta An object discovered March 18, 1892, by Max Wolf with provisional designation "1892 X" was named 330 Adalberta , but was lost and never recovered. In 1982 it was determined that the observations leading to the designation of 1892 X were stars, and the object never existed. The name and number 330 Adalberta was then reused for another asteroid discovered by Max Wolf on February 2, 1910, which had the provisional designation A910 CB.

525 Adelaide and 1171 Rusthawelia The object A904 EB discovered March 14, 1904, by Max Wolf was named 525 Adelaide and was subsequently lost. Later, the object 1930 TA discovered October 3, 1930, by Sylvain Arend was named 1171 Rusthawelia . In those pre-computer days, it was not realized until 1958 that these were one and the same object. The name Rusthawelia was kept (and discovery credited to Arend); the name 525 Adelaide was reused for the object 1908 EKa discovered October 21, 1908, by Joel Hastings Metcalf .

715 Transvaalia and 933 Susi The object 1911 LX discovered April 22, 1911, by H. E. Wood was named 715 Transvaalia . On April 23, 1920, the object 1920 GZ was discovered and named 933 Susi . In 1928 it was realized that these were one and the same object. The name Transvaalia was kept, and the name and number 933 Susi was reused for the object 1927 CH discovered February 10, 1927, by Karl Reinmuth .

864 Aase and 1078 Mentha The object A917 CB discovered February 13, 1917, by Max Wolf was named 864 Aase , and the object 1926 XB discovered December 7, 1926, by Karl Reinmuth was named 1078 Mentha . In 1958 it was discovered that these were one and the same object. In 1974, this was resolved by keeping the name 1078 Mentha and reusing the name and number 864 Aase for the object 1921 KE , discovered September 30, 1921, by Karl Reinmuth .

1095 Tulipa and 1449 Virtanen The object 1928 DC discovered February 24, 1928, by Karl Reinmuth was named 1095 Tulipa , and the object 1938 DO discovered February 20, 1938, by Yrjö Väisälä was named 1449 Virtanen . In 1966 it was discovered that these were one and the same object. The name 1449 Virtanen was kept and the name and number 1095 Tulipa was reused for the object 1926 GS discovered April 14, 1926, by Karl Reinmuth .

1125 China and 3789 Zhongguo The object 1928 UF discovered October 25, 1928, by Zhang Yuzhe (Y. C. Chang) was named 1125 China , and was later lost. Later, the object 1957 UN 1 was discovered on October 30, 1957, at Purple Mountain Observatory and was initially incorrectly believed to be the rediscovery of the object 1928 UF. The name and number 1125 China were then reused for the object 1957 UN 1 , and 1928 UF remained lost. In 1986, the object 1986 QK 1 was discovered and proved to be the real rediscovery of 1928 UF. This object was given the new number and name 3789 Zhongguo . Note Zhongguo is the Mandarin Chinese word for "China", in pinyin transliteration.

Asteroid 1317 and 787 Moskva The object 1914 UQ discovered April 20, 1914, by G. N. Neujmin was named 787 Moskva (and retains that name to this day). The object 1934 FD discovered on March 19, 1934, by C. Jackson was given the sequence number 1317. In 1938, G. N. Neujmin found that asteroid 1317 and 787 Moskva were one and the same object. The sequence number 1317 was later reused for the object 1935 RC discovered on September 1, 1935, by Karl Reinmuth ; that object is now known as 1317 Silvretta .

Landmark names [ edit ] Asteroids were originally named after female mythological figures. Over time the rules loosened.

First asteroid with non-Classical and non-Latinized name: 64 Angelina (in honor of a research station) First asteroid with a non-feminine name: 139 Juewa (ambiguous) or 141 Lumen First asteroid with a non-feminized man's name: 433 Eros Lowest-numbered unnamed asteroid (As of 2024 [update] ): (4596) 1981 QB Landmark numbers [ edit ] Many landmark numbers had specially chosen names for asteroids, and there was some debate about whether Pluto should have received number 10000, for example. This list includes some non-asteroids.
