Describes the situation of the aspects of social life such as economy , law , family , and politics during the research.

[ 1 ] Empirical sociology is often concerned with aspects of everyday life with common sense, which it treats as a resource, a form of knowledge.

[ 2 ] Empirical sociology inductively studies how people appreciate and get along with each other.

[ 3 ] Empirical sociology is an American tradition with roots in the social reform movements of the Progressive Era .

[ 4 ] Definition [ edit ] The task of empirical sociology is to conduct inductive research on a particular social phenomenon .

[ 5 ] The German sociologist Ferdinand Tönnies defined empirical sociology as the collection of factual information or evidence .

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] Sociologist Morris Janowitz defined empirical sociology as collecting and planning empirical indicators of change.

[ 8 ] Morris describes the relationship between history and empirical sociology as "At this point, sociology and "history” converge. All empirical sociology is history, but history is not all empirical sociology".

[ 8 ] Timeline [ edit ] The first stage of empirical sociology was represented by the changes introduced into the scientific procedure by the Chicago school between 1895 and 1929.

[ 9 ] The American sociologist Barry Smart, in his book "Sociology, phenomenology and Marxian analysis" that empirical sociology is established in Eastern Europe .

[ 10 ] Polish sociologist Ludwig Gumplowicz has done sociological research on society and law . Gumplowicz's main contribution to the development of empirical sociology is its focus on groups of people.

[ 11 ] Austrian philosopher of science and sociologist Otto Neurath was instrumental in the development of empirical sociology.

[ 12 ] Approaches See also: Empiricism and Positivism Empirical sociology, like Parsons 's systems theory, is defined and criticized as " positivism ". For Adorno , positivism is here characterized by two not necessarily related features.

[ 13 ] Empiricism and positivism [ edit ] Empirical and positivist approaches in sociology argue that data collection and analysis are important.

[ 14 ] Empiricism is the idea that knowledge can only be based on what our senses tell us, rather than our thoughts and feelings.

[ 14 ] Empirical sociology is therefore the view that sociology should be based on data gathered from our senses rather than abstract object theory .

[ 14 ] Positivism initially looks like empiricism, but positivism is, at some level, the belief that social issues should be studied using the methods of the physical sciences .

[ 14 ] Notable Studies [ edit ] Several landmark studies have shaped empirical sociology: Émile Durkheim's Suicide (1897) – Analyzed how social integration and regulation affect suicide rates.

The Hawthorne Studies (1920s-1930s) – Explored workplace productivity and led to insights on social influences in work environments.

Robert K. Merton's work on social structures – Developed theories on deviance and social roles based on empirical research.

Modern Big Data Studies – Utilize computational methods and large datasets to analyze social behavior at scale.
