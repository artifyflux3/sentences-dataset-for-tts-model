Nave URL hyperphysics .phy-astr .gsu .edu HyperPhysics is an educational website about physics topics. 
The information architecture of the website is based on HyperCard , the platform on which the material was originally developed, [ 1 ] [ 2 ] and a thesaurus organization, with thousands of controlled links and usual trees organizing topics from general to specific. It also exploits concept maps to facilitate smooth navigation.

[ 3 ] HyperPhysics is hosted by Georgia State University and authored by Georgia State faculty member Dr. Rod Nave.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] In the early 2000s, various teaching and education facilitators made use of HyperPhysics material through projects [ 6 ] and organizations, [ 7 ] and also publishers which use SciLinks .
