Air density, like air pressure, decreases with increasing altitude. It also changes with variations in atmospheric pressure, temperature, and humidity . According to the ISO International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the standard sea level density of air at 101.325 kPa (abs) and 15 °C (59 °F ) is 1.2250 kg/m 3 (0.07647 lb/cu ft ).

[ 1 ] This is about 1 ⁄ 800 that of water , which has a density of about 1,000 kg/m 3 (62 lb/cu ft).

Air density is a property used in many branches of science, engineering, and industry, including aeronautics ; [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] gravimetric analysis ; [ 5 ] the air-conditioning industry; [ 6 ] atmospheric research and meteorology ; [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] agricultural engineering (modeling and tracking of Soil-Vegetation-Atmosphere-Transfer (SVAT) models); [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] and the engineering community that deals with compressed air.

[ 13 ] Depending on the measuring instruments used, different sets of equations for the calculation of the density of air can be applied.  Air is a mixture of gases and the calculations always simplify, to a greater or lesser extent, the properties of the mixture.

Temperature [ edit ] Other things being equal (most notably the pressure and humidity), hotter air is less dense than cooler air and will thus rise while cooler air tends to fall due to buoyancy . This can be seen by using the ideal gas law as an approximation.

Dry air [ edit ] The density of dry air can be calculated using the ideal gas law , expressed as a function of temperature and pressure: [ citation needed ] ρ ρ = p R specific T R specific = R M = k B m ρ ρ = p M R T = p m k B T {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\rho &={\frac {p}{R_{\text{specific}}T}}\\R_{\text{specific}}&={\frac {R}{M}}={\frac {k_{\rm {B}}}{m}}\\\rho &={\frac {pM}{RT}}={\frac {pm}{k_{\rm {B}}T}}\\\end{aligned}}} where: ρ ρ {\displaystyle \rho } , air density (kg/m 3 ) [ note 2 ] p {\displaystyle p} , absolute pressure (Pa) [ note 2 ] T {\displaystyle T} , absolute temperature (K) [ note 2 ] R {\displaystyle R} is the gas constant , 8.314 462 618 153 24 in J ⋅ K −1 ⋅ mol −1 [ note 2 ] M {\displaystyle M} is the molar mass of dry air, approximately 0.028 9652 in kg ⋅ mol −1 .

[ note 2 ] k B {\displaystyle k_{\rm {B}}} is the Boltzmann constant , 1.380 649 × 10 −23 in J ⋅ K −1 [ note 2 ] m {\displaystyle m} is the molecular mass of dry air, approximately 4.81 × 10 −26 in kg .

[ note 2 ] R specific {\displaystyle R_{\text{specific}}} , the specific gas constant for dry air, which using the values presented above would be approximately 287.050 0676 in J⋅kg −1 ⋅K −1 .

[ note 2 ] Therefore: At IUPAC standard temperature and pressure (0 °C and 100 k Pa ), dry air has a density of approximately 1.2754 kg /m 3 .

At 20 °C and 101.325 kPa, dry air has a density of 1.2041 kg/m 3 .

At 70 °F and 14.696 psi , dry air has a density of 0.074887 lb / ft 3 .

The following table illustrates the air density–temperature relationship at 1 atm or 101.325 kPa: [ citation needed ] Effect of temperature on properties of air Celsius tempe­rature θ [ °C ] Speed of sound c [ m / s ] Density of air ρ [ kg / m 3 ] Characteristic specific acoustic impedance z 0 [ Pa ⋅ s / m ] 35 351.88 1.1455 403.2 30 349.02 1.1644 406.5 25 346.13 1.1839 409.4 20 343.21 1.2041 413.3 15 340.27 1.2250 416.9 10 337.31 1.2466 420.5 5 334.32 1.2690 424.3 0 331.30 1.2922 428.0 −5 328.25 1.3163 432.1 −10 325.18 1.3413 436.1 −15 322.07 1.3673 440.3 −20 318.94 1.3943 444.6 −25 315.77 1.4224 449.1 Humid air [ edit ] Further information: Humidity Effect of temperature and relative humidity on air density The addition of water vapor to air (making the air humid) reduces the density of the air, which may at first appear counter-intuitive. This occurs because the molar mass of water vapor (18 g/mol) is less than the molar mass of dry air [ note 3 ] (around 29 g/mol).  For any ideal gas, at a given temperature and pressure, the number of molecules is constant for a particular volume (see Avogadro's Law ).  So when water molecules (water vapor) are added to a given volume of air, the dry air molecules must decrease by the same number, to keep the pressure from increasing or temperature from decreasing.  Hence the mass per unit volume of the gas (its density) decreases.

The density of humid air may be calculated by treating it as a mixture of ideal gases . In this case, the partial pressure of water vapor is known as the vapor pressure . Using this method, error in the density calculation is less than 0.2% in the range of −10 °C to 50 °C. The density of humid air is found by: [ 14 ] ρ ρ humid air = p d R d T + p v R v T = p d M d + p v M v R T {\displaystyle \rho _{\text{humid air}}={\frac {p_{\text{d}}}{R_{\text{d}}T}}+{\frac {p_{\text{v}}}{R_{\text{v}}T}}={\frac {p_{\text{d}}M_{\text{d}}+p_{\text{v}}M_{\text{v}}}{RT}}} where: ρ ρ humid air {\displaystyle \rho _{\text{humid air}}} , density of the humid air (kg/m 3 ) p d {\displaystyle p_{\text{d}}} , partial pressure of dry air (Pa) R d {\displaystyle R_{\text{d}}} , specific gas constant for dry air, 287.058 J/(kg·K) T {\displaystyle T} , temperature ( K ) p v {\displaystyle p_{\text{v}}} , pressure of water vapor (Pa) R v {\displaystyle R_{\text{v}}} , specific gas constant for water vapor, 461.495 J/(kg·K) M d {\displaystyle M_{\text{d}}} , molar mass of dry air, 0.0289652 kg/mol M v {\displaystyle M_{\text{v}}} , molar mass of water vapor, 0.018016 kg/mol R {\displaystyle R} , universal gas constant , 8.31446 J/(K·mol) The vapor pressure of water may be calculated from the saturation vapor pressure and relative humidity . It is found by: p v = ϕ ϕ p sat {\displaystyle p_{\text{v}}=\phi p_{\text{sat}}} where: p v {\displaystyle p_{\text{v}}} , vapor pressure of water ϕ ϕ {\displaystyle \phi } , relative humidity (0.0–1.0) p sat {\displaystyle p_{\text{sat}}} , saturation vapor pressure The saturation vapor pressure of water at any given temperature is the vapor pressure when relative humidity is 100%. One formula is Tetens' equation from [ 15 ] used to find the saturation vapor pressure is: p sat = 0.61078 exp ⁡ ⁡ ( 17.27 ( T − − 273.15 ) T − − 35.85 ) {\displaystyle p_{\text{sat}}=0.61078\exp \left({\frac {17.27(T-273.15)}{T-35.85}}\right)} where: p sat {\displaystyle p_{\text{sat}}} , saturation vapor pressure (kPa) T {\displaystyle T} , temperature ( K ) See vapor pressure of water for other equations.

The partial pressure of dry air p d {\displaystyle p_{\text{d}}} is found considering partial pressure , resulting in: p d = p − − p v {\displaystyle p_{\text{d}}=p-p_{\text{v}}} where p {\displaystyle p} simply denotes the observed absolute pressure .

Variation with altitude [ edit ] Further information: Barometric formula § Density equations Standard atmosphere: p 0 = 101.325 kPa , T 0 = 288.15 K , ρ 0 = 1.225 kg/m 3 Troposphere [ edit ] To calculate the density of air as a function of altitude, one requires additional parameters. For the troposphere, the lowest part (~10 km) of the atmosphere, they are listed below, along with their values according to the International Standard Atmosphere , using for calculation the universal gas constant instead of the air specific constant: p 0 {\displaystyle p_{0}} , sea level standard atmospheric pressure, 101325 Pa T 0 {\displaystyle T_{0}} , sea level standard temperature, 288.15 K g {\displaystyle g} , earth-surface gravitational acceleration, 9.80665 m/s 2 L {\displaystyle L} , temperature lapse rate , 0.0065 K/m R {\displaystyle R} , ideal (universal) gas constant, 8.31446 J/( mol ·K) M {\displaystyle M} , molar mass of dry air, 0.0289652 kg/mol Temperature at altitude h {\displaystyle h} meters above sea level is approximated by the following formula (only valid inside the troposphere , no more than ~18 km above Earth's surface (and lower away from Equator)): T = T 0 − − L h {\displaystyle T=T_{0}-Lh} The pressure at altitude h {\displaystyle h} is given by: p = p 0 ( 1 − − L h T 0 ) g M R L {\displaystyle p=p_{0}\left(1-{\frac {Lh}{T_{0}}}\right)^{\frac {gM}{RL}}} Density can then be calculated according to a molar form of the ideal gas law : ρ ρ = p M R T = p M R T 0 ( 1 − − L h T 0 ) = p 0 M R T 0 ( 1 − − L h T 0 ) g M R L − − 1 {\displaystyle \rho ={\frac {pM}{RT}}={\frac {pM}{RT_{0}\left(1-{\frac {Lh}{T_{0}}}\right)}}={\frac {p_{0}M}{RT_{0}}}\left(1-{\frac {Lh}{T_{0}}}\right)^{{\frac {gM}{RL}}-1}} where: M {\displaystyle M} , molar mass R {\displaystyle R} , ideal gas constant T {\displaystyle T} , absolute temperature p {\displaystyle p} , absolute pressure Note that the density close to the ground is ρ ρ 0 = p 0 M R T 0 {\textstyle \rho _{0}={\frac {p_{0}M}{RT_{0}}}} It can be easily verified that the hydrostatic equation holds: d p d h = − − g ρ ρ .

{\displaystyle {\frac {dp}{dh}}=-g\rho .} Exponential approximation [ edit ] As the temperature varies with height inside the troposphere by less than 25%, L h T 0 < 0.25 {\textstyle {\frac {Lh}{T_{0}}}<0.25} and one may approximate: ρ ρ = ρ ρ 0 e ( g M R L − − 1 ) ln ⁡ ⁡ ( 1 − − L h T 0 ) ≈ ≈ ρ ρ 0 e − − ( g M R L − − 1 ) L h T 0 = ρ ρ 0 e − − ( g M h R T 0 − − L h T 0 ) {\displaystyle \rho =\rho _{0}e^{\left({\frac {gM}{RL}}-1\right)\ln \left(1-{\frac {Lh}{T_{0}}}\right)}\approx \rho _{0}e^{-\left({\frac {gM}{RL}}-1\right){\frac {Lh}{T_{0}}}}=\rho _{0}e^{-\left({\frac {gMh}{RT_{0}}}-{\frac {Lh}{T_{0}}}\right)}} Thus: ρ ρ ≈ ≈ ρ ρ 0 e − − h / H n {\displaystyle \rho \approx \rho _{0}e^{-h/H_{n}}} Which is identical to the isothermal solution, except that H n , the height scale of the exponential fall for density (as well as for number density n), is not equal to RT 0 / gM as one would expect for an isothermal atmosphere, but rather: 1 H n = g M R T 0 − − L T 0 {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{H_{n}}}={\frac {gM}{RT_{0}}}-{\frac {L}{T_{0}}}} Which gives H n = 10.4 km.

Note that for different gasses, the value of H n differs, according to the molar mass M : It is 10.9 for nitrogen, 9.2 for oxygen and 6.3 for carbon dioxide . The theoretical value for water vapor is 19.6, but due to vapor condensation the water vapor density dependence is highly variable and is not well approximated by this formula.

The pressure can be approximated by another exponent: p = p 0 e g M R L ln ⁡ ⁡ ( 1 − − L h T 0 ) ≈ ≈ p 0 e − − g M R L L h T 0 = p 0 e − − g M h R T 0 {\displaystyle p=p_{0}e^{{\frac {gM}{RL}}\ln \left(1-{\frac {Lh}{T_{0}}}\right)}\approx p_{0}e^{-{\frac {gM}{RL}}{\frac {Lh}{T_{0}}}}=p_{0}e^{-{\frac {gMh}{RT_{0}}}}} Which is identical to the isothermal solution, with the same height scale H p = RT 0 / gM . Note that the hydrostatic equation no longer holds for the exponential approximation (unless L is neglected).

H p is 8.4 km, but for different gasses (measuring their partial pressure), it is again different and depends upon molar mass, giving 8.7 for nitrogen, 7.6 for oxygen and 5.6 for carbon dioxide.

Total content [ edit ] Further note that since g , Earth's gravitational acceleration , is approximately constant with altitude in the atmosphere, the pressure at height h is proportional to the integral of the density in the column above h , and therefore to the mass in the atmosphere above height h . Therefore, the mass fraction of the troposphere out of all the atmosphere is given using the approximated formula for p : 1 − − p ( h = 11 km ) p 0 = 1 − − ( T ( 11 km ) T 0 ) g M R L ≈ ≈ 76 % % {\displaystyle 1-{\frac {p(h=11{\text{ km}})}{p_{0}}}=1-\left({\frac {T(11{\text{ km}})}{T_{0}}}\right)^{\frac {gM}{RL}}\approx 76\%} For nitrogen, it is 75%, while for oxygen this is 79%, and for carbon dioxide, 88%.

Tropopause [ edit ] Higher than the troposphere, at the tropopause , the temperature is approximately constant with altitude (up to ~20 km) and is 220 K. This means that at this layer L = 0 and T = 220 K , so that the exponential drop is faster, with H TP = 6.3 km for air (6.5 for nitrogen, 5.7 for oxygen and 4.2 for carbon dioxide). Both the pressure and density obey this law, so, denoting the height of the border between the troposphere and the tropopause as U : p = p ( U ) e − − h − − U H TP = p 0 ( 1 − − L U T 0 ) g M R L e − − h − − U H TP ρ ρ = ρ ρ ( U ) e − − h − − U H TP = ρ ρ 0 ( 1 − − L U T 0 ) g M R L − − 1 e − − h − − U H TP {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}p&=p(U)e^{-{\frac {h-U}{H_{\text{TP}}}}}=p_{0}\left(1-{\frac {LU}{T_{0}}}\right)^{\frac {gM}{RL}}e^{-{\frac {h-U}{H_{\text{TP}}}}}\\\rho &=\rho (U)e^{-{\frac {h-U}{H_{\text{TP}}}}}=\rho _{0}\left(1-{\frac {LU}{T_{0}}}\right)^{{\frac {gM}{RL}}-1}e^{-{\frac {h-U}{H_{\text{TP}}}}}\end{aligned}}} Composition [ edit ] Composition of dry atmosphere, by volume [ ▽ note 1 ] [ ▽ note 2 ] Gas (and others) Various [ 16 ] CIPM-2007 [ 17 ] ASHRAE [ 18 ] Schlatter [ 19 ] ICAO [ 20 ] US StdAtm76 [ 21 ] ▼ Tap to expand or collapse table ▲ ppmv [ ▽ note 3 ] percentage ppmv percentage ppmv percentage ppmv percentage ppmv percentage ppmv percentage Nitrogen N 2 780,800 78.080% 780,848 78.0848% 780,818 78.0818% 780,840 78.084% 780,840 78.084% 780,840 78.084% Oxygen O 2 209,500 20.950% 209,390 20.9390% 209,435 20.9435% 209,460 20.946% 209,476 20.9476% 209,476 20.9476% Argon Ar 9,340 0.9340% 9,332 0.9332% 9,332 0.9332% 9,340 0.9340% 9,340 0.9340% 9,340 0.9340% Carbon dioxide CO 2 397.8 0.03978% 400 0.0400% 385 0.0385% 384 0.0384% 314 0.0314% 314 0.0314% Neon Ne 18.18 0.001818% 18.2 0.00182% 18.2 0.00182% 18.18 0.001818% 18.18 0.001818% 18.18 0.001818% Helium He 5.24 0.000524% 5.2 0.00052% 5.2 0.00052% 5.24 0.000524% 5.24 0.000524% 5.24 0.000524% Methane CH 4 1.81 0.000181% 1.5 0.00015% 1.5 0.00015% 1.774 0.0001774% 2 0.0002% 2 0.0002% Krypton Kr 1.14 0.000114% 1.1 0.00011% 1.1 0.00011% 1.14 0.000114% 1.14 0.000114% 1.14 0.000114% Hydrogen H 2 0.55 0.000055% 0.5 0.00005% 0.5 0.00005% 0.56 0.000056% 0.5 0.00005% 0.5 0.00005% Nitrous oxide N 2 O 0.325 0.0000325% 0.3 0.00003% 0.3 0.00003% 0.320 0.0000320% 0.5 0.00005% - - Carbon monoxide CO 0.1 0.00001% 0.2 0.00002% 0.2 0.00002% - - - - - - Xenon Xe 0.09 0.000009% 0.1 0.00001% 0.1 0.00001% 0.09 0.000009% 0.087 0.0000087% 0.087 0.0000087% Nitrogen dioxide NO 2 0.02 0.000002% - - - - - - Up to 0.02 Up to 0.000002% - - Iodine I 2 0.01 0.000001% - - - - - - Up to 0.01 Up to 0.000001% - - Ammonia NH 3 trace trace - - - - - - - - Sulfur dioxide SO 2 trace trace - - - - - - Up to 1.00 Up to 0.0001% - - Ozone O 3 0.02 to 0.07 2 to 7 × 10 −6 % - - - - 0.01 to 0.10 1 to 10 × 10 −6 % Up to 0.02 to 0.07 [ ▽ note 4 ] Up to 2 to 7 × 10 −6 % [ ▽ note 4 ] - - Trace to 30 ppm [ ▽ note 5 ] — - - - - 2.9 0.00029% - - - - - - Dry air total air 1,000,000 100.00% 1,000,000 100.00% 1,000,000 100.00% 1,000,000 100.00% 1,000,000 100.00% 1,000,080 100.00% Not included in above dry atmosphere Water vapor H 2 O ~0.25% by mass over full atmosphere, locally 0.001–5% by volume.
