It is a group of collectors and enthusiasts interested in the history of horology .

Given that Switzerland is quadrilingual, they needed a language-neutral name for their organisation.  They invented the term chronometrophilia from the Greek chronos (time) and philia ("the love of"); and meter , a Teutonic word cognate to the Latin modius (bushel).

[ 1 ] The association was founded in 1976 and unites collectors, scholars and museum professionals interested in the historical aspects of clocks and watches .  Meetings are held about 4 times a year in various locations in Switzerland and are usually conducted bilingually in French and German.  Most meetings involve visits to museums, restoration workshops or private collections.  Once a year the organization also organises an international study tour, travelling to a foreign locale to study historic horological artefacts.

"Chronometrophilia" is also the name of their semi-annual glossy, scholarly journal (published with articles in both French and German).

The administrative office of Chronometrophilia is located in La Chaux-de-Fonds , a Swiss town in the Jura mountains that is considered the focus of the Swiss watchmaking industry and which also houses the Musée International d'Horlogerie .

Its main sister organizations in other countries pursuing similar goals are: Antiquarian Horological Society - AHS (United Kingdom) Association Française des Amateurs d'Horlogerie Ancienne - AFAHA (France) Deutsche Gesellschaft für Chronometrie - DGC (Germany) HORA Associazione Italiana Cultori di Orologeria Antica (Italy) National Association of Watch and Clock Collectors - NAWCC (United States of America) References [ edit ] ^ Oxford English Dictionary.
