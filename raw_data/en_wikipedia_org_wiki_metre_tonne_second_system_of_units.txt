[ 1 ] It was adopted by the Soviet Union in 1933 and abolished there in 1955. It was a coherent metric system of units, much as SI (itself a refinement of the MKS system ) and the centimetre–gram–second system (CGS), but with larger units for industrial use, whereas the CGS system was regarded as only really suitable for laboratory use.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] Units [ edit ] The base units of the MTS system are: Length : metre Mass : tonne , 1 t = 10 3 kg = 1 Mg Time : second Some common derived units: Volume : cubic metre or stere 1 m 3 ≡ 1 st Force : sthène , 1 sn = 1 t⋅m/s 2 = 10 3 N = 1 kN Energy : sthène-metre = kilojoule , 1 sn⋅m = 1 t⋅m 2 /s 2 = 10 3 J = 1 kJ Power : sthène-metre per second = kilowatt , 1 sn⋅m/s = 1 t⋅m 2 /s 3 = 10 3 W = 1 kW Pressure : pièze , 1 pz = 1 t/m⋅s 2 = 10 3 Pa = 1 kPa = 1 cbar (centibar) See also [ edit ] Foot–pound–second system of units (FPS) List of metric units Metre–kilogram–second system of units (MKS) References [ edit ] ^ "Décret" 5 May 1961, "Journal Officiel" ^ "System of Measurement Units" .
