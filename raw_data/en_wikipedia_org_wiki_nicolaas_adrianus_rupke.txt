[ 1 ] He studied biology and geology at the university of Groningen and geology and the history of science at Princeton and Oxford . Early in his studies, Rupke was a Christian and proponent of Flood geology , [ 2 ] but later came to reject this position. When in 1977 he was elected to a Wolfson College, Oxford research position in the history of science, Rupke made this subject his full-time occupation. A series of similar international research posts followed, until in 1993 he took up a professorship at Göttingen University to teach the history of science and medicine .

[ 3 ] In 2009, Rupke was awarded a Lower Saxony research chair.

[ 4 ] In 2012, he took up an endowed professorship at Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia , USA.

Rupke is known for his studies of late-modern biology, geology and science & religion . With an interest in the biographical approach, he restored to their contemporary prominence several nineteenth-century scientists, most important among them Richard Owen who well before the appearance of The Origin of Species developed a naturalistic theory of evolution, albeit a non-Darwinian one.

[ 5 ] Studies of Alexander von Humboldt came next, [ 6 ] in which Rupke developed what he terms the metabiographical approach by exploring how a famous life – in this case Humboldt's – may be multiply retold and reconstructed as part of different belief systems and memory cultures.

[ 7 ] Rupke is a fellow of Germany's National Academy of Sciences Leopoldina [ 8 ] and of the Göttingen Academy of Sciences .
