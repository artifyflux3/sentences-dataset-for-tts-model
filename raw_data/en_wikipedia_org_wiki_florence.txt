It is also the most populated city in Tuscany, with 362,353 inhabitants, and 989,460 in its metropolitan province as of 2025.

[ 2 ] Florence was a centre of medieval European trade and finance and one of the wealthiest cities of that era.

[ 4 ] It is considered by many academics [ 5 ] to have been the birthplace of the Renaissance , becoming a major artistic, cultural, commercial, political, economic and financial center.

[ 6 ] During this time, Florence rose to a position of enormous influence in Italy, Europe, and beyond.

[ 7 ] Its turbulent political history includes periods of rule by the powerful Medici family and numerous religious and republican revolutions.

[ 8 ] From 1865 to 1871 the city served as the capital of the Kingdom of Italy . The Florentine dialect forms the base of standard Italian and it became the language of culture throughout Italy [ 9 ] due to the prestige of the masterpieces by Dante Alighieri , Petrarch , Giovanni Boccaccio , Niccolò Machiavelli and Francesco Guicciardini .

Located about 275 kilometres (171 mi) northwest of Rome , Florence attracts millions of tourists each year, and UNESCO declared the Historic Centre of Florence a World Heritage Site in 1982. The city is noted for its culture, Renaissance art and architecture and monuments.

[ 10 ] The city also contains numerous museums and art galleries, such as the Uffizi Gallery and the Palazzo Pitti , and still exerts an influence in the fields of art, culture and politics.

[ 11 ] Due to Florence's artistic and architectural heritage, Forbes ranked it as one of the most beautiful cities in the world in 2010.

[ 12 ] Florence plays an important role in Italian fashion , [ 11 ] and is ranked in the top 15 fashion capitals of the world by Global Language Monitor ; [ 13 ] furthermore, it is a major national economic centre, [ 11 ] as well as a tourist and industrial hub.

Etymology [ edit ] Firenze comes from Florentiae , locative form of Florentia , in turn a name conveying good luck, from Latin : florēre , lit.

'to blossom'.

It was politically, economically, and culturally one of the most important cities in Europe and the world from the 14th to 16th centuries.

[ 10 ] The language spoken in the city during the 14th century came to be accepted as the model for what would become the Italian language . Thanks especially to the works of the Tuscans Dante , Petrarch and Boccaccio , [ 15 ] the Florentine dialect, above all the local dialects, was adopted as the basis for a national literary language.

[ 16 ] [ 17 ] Starting from the late Middle Ages , Florentine money—in the form of the gold florin —financed the development of industry all over Europe, from Britain to Bruges , to Lyon and Hungary . Florentine bankers financed the English kings during the Hundred Years' War . They similarly financed the papacy, including the construction of their provisional capital of Avignon and, after their return to Rome, the reconstruction and Renaissance embellishment of Rome.

Florence was home to the Medici, one of European history's most important noble families.

Lorenzo de' Medici was considered a political and cultural mastermind of Italy in the late 15th century. Two members of the family were popes in the early 16th century: Leo X and Clement VII .

Catherine de' Medici married King Henry II of France and, after his death in 1559, reigned as regent in France.

Marie de' Medici married Henry IV of France and gave birth to the future King Louis XIII . The Medici reigned as Grand Dukes of Tuscany , starting with Cosimo I de' Medici in 1569 and ending with the death of Gian Gastone de' Medici in 1737.

The Kingdom of Italy , which was established in 1861, moved its capital from Turin to Florence in 1865, although the capital was moved to Rome in 1871.

Roman origins [ edit ] Main article: Florentia (Roman city) Florence was established by the Romans in 59 BC as a colony for veteran soldiers and was built in the style of an army camp .

[ 18 ] Situated along the Via Cassia , the main route between Rome and the north, and within the fertile valley of the Arno , the settlement quickly became an important commercial centre and in AD 285 became the capital of the Tuscia region.

Early Middle Ages [ edit ] The Goth King Totila razes the walls of Florence during the Gothic War : illumination from the Chigi manuscript of Villani's Cronica In centuries to come, the city experienced turbulent alternate periods of Ostrogoth and Byzantine rule, during which the city was fought over, helping to cause the population to fall to as low as 1,000 people.

[ 19 ] Peace returned under Lombard rule in the 6th century and Florence was in turn conquered by Charlemagne in 774 becoming part of the March of Tuscany centred on Lucca . The population began to grow again and commerce prospered.

Second millennium [ edit ] The Basilica di San Miniato al Monte Margrave Hugo chose Florence as his residency instead of Lucca around 1000 AD. The Golden Age of Florentine art began around this time. In 1100, Florence was a " commune ", meaning a city-state. The city's primary resource was the Arno river , providing power and access for the industry (mainly textile industry), and access to the Mediterranean sea for international trade, helping the growth of an industrious merchant community. The Florentine merchant banking skills became recognised in Europe after they brought decisive financial innovation (e.g.

bills of exchange , [ 20 ] double-entry bookkeeping system ) to medieval fairs. This period also saw the eclipse of Florence's formerly powerful rival Pisa .

[ 21 ] The growing power of the merchant elite culminated in an anti-aristocratic uprising, led by Giano della Bella , resulting in the Ordinances of Justice [ 22 ] which entrenched the power of the elite guilds until the end of the Republic.

Middle Ages and Renaissance [ edit ] Main articles: Republic of Florence and Italian Renaissance Rise of the Medici [ edit ] Leonardo da Vinci statue outside the Uffizi Gallery Painting based on an original from the late 15th century, attributed to Francesco di Lorenzo Rosselli At the height of demographic expansion around 1325, the urban population may have been as great as 120,000, and the rural population around the city was probably close to 300,000.

[ 23 ] The Black Death of 1348 reduced it by over half.

[ 24 ] [ 25 ] About 25,000 are said to have been supported by the city's wool industry: in 1345 Florence was the scene of an attempted strike by wool combers ( ciompi ), who in 1378 rose up in a brief revolt against oligarchic rule in the Revolt of the Ciompi . After their suppression, Florence came under the sway (1382–1434) of the Albizzi family, who became bitter rivals of the Medici.

In the 15th century, Florence was among the largest cities in Europe, with a population of 60,000, and was considered rich and economically successful.

[ 26 ] Cosimo de' Medici was the first Medici family member to essentially control the city from behind the scenes. Although the city was technically a democracy of sorts, his power came from a vast patronage network along with his alliance to the new immigrants, the gente nuova (new people). The fact that the Medici were bankers to the pope also contributed to their ascendancy. Cosimo was succeeded by his son Piero , who was, soon after, succeeded by Cosimo's grandson, Lorenzo in 1469. Lorenzo was a great patron of the arts, commissioning works by Michelangelo , Leonardo da Vinci and Botticelli . Lorenzo was an accomplished poet and musician and brought composers and singers to Florence, including Alexander Agricola , Johannes Ghiselin , and Heinrich Isaac . By contemporary Florentines (and since), he was known as "Lorenzo the Magnificent" (Lorenzo il Magnifico).

Following Lorenzo de' Medici's death in 1492, he was succeeded by his son Piero II . When the French king Charles VIII invaded northern Italy , Piero II chose to resist his army. But when he realised the size of the French army at the gates of Pisa, he had to accept the humiliating conditions of the French king. These made the Florentines rebel, and they expelled Piero II. With his exile in 1494, the first period of Medici rule ended with the restoration of a republican government.

Savonarola, Machiavelli, and the Medici popes [ edit ] Girolamo Savonarola being hanged and burned in 1498. The brooding Palazzo Vecchio is at centre right.

During this period, the Dominican friar Girolamo Savonarola had become prior of the San Marco monastery in 1490. He was famed for his penitential sermons, lambasting what he viewed as widespread immorality and attachment to material riches. He praised the exile of the Medici as the work of God, punishing them for their decadence. He seized the opportunity to carry through political reforms leading to a more democratic rule. But when Savonarola publicly accused Pope Alexander VI of corruption, he was banned from speaking in public. When he broke this ban, he was excommunicated. The Florentines, tired of his teachings, turned against him and arrested him. He was convicted as a heretic, hanged and burned on the Piazza della Signoria on 23 May 1498. His ashes were dispersed in the Arno river.

[ 27 ] Another Florentine of this period was Niccolò Machiavelli , whose prescriptions for Florence's regeneration under strong leadership have often been seen as a legitimization of political expediency and even malpractice. Machiavelli was a political thinker, renowned for his political handbook The Prince , which is about ruling and exercising power. Commissioned by the Medici, Machiavelli also wrote the Florentine Histories , the history of the city.

In 1512, the Medici retook control of Florence with the help of Spanish and Papal troops.

[ 28 ] They were led by two cousins, Giovanni and Giulio de' Medici , both of whom would later become Popes of the Catholic Church, (Leo X and Clement VII, respectively). Both were generous patrons of the arts, commissioning works like Michelangelo 's Laurentian Library and Medici Chapel in Florence, to name just two.

[ 29 ] [ 30 ] Their reigns coincided with political upheaval in Italy, and thus in 1527, Florentines drove out the Medici for a second time and re-established a theocratic republic on 16 May 1527, (Jesus Christ was named King of Florence).

[ 31 ] The Medici returned to power in Florence in 1530, with the armies of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V and the blessings of Pope Clement VII (Giulio de' Medici).

Florence officially became a monarchy in 1531, when Emperor Charles and Pope Clement named Alessandro de' Medici as Duke of the Florentine Republic . The Medici's monarchy would last over two centuries. Alessandro's successor, Cosimo I de' Medici , was named Grand Duke of Tuscany in 1569; in all Tuscany, only the Republic of Lucca (later a Duchy ) and the Principality of Piombino were independent from Florence.

18th and 19th centuries [ edit ] Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor and his family. Leopold was, from 1765 to 1790, the Grand Duke of Tuscany.

The extinction of the Medici dynasty and the accession in 1737 of Francis Stephen , duke of Lorraine and husband of Maria Theresa of Austria , led to Tuscany's temporary inclusion in the territories of the Austrian crown. It became a secundogeniture of the Habsburg-Lorraine dynasty, who were deposed for the House of Bourbon-Parma in 1801. From 1801 to 1807 Florence was the capital of the Napoleonic client state Kingdom of Etruria . The Bourbon-Parma were deposed in December 1807 when Tuscany was annexed by France . Florence was the prefecture of the French département of Arno from 1808 to the fall of Napoleon in 1814. The Habsburg-Lorraine dynasty was restored on the throne of Tuscany at the Congress of Vienna but finally deposed in 1859. Tuscany became a region of the Kingdom of Italy in 1861.

Florence replaced Turin as Italy's capital in 1865 and, in an effort to modernise the city, the old market in the Piazza del Mercato Vecchio and many medieval houses were pulled down and replaced by a more formal street plan with newer houses. The Piazza (first renamed Piazza Vittorio Emanuele II , then Piazza della Repubblica , the present name) was significantly widened and a large triumphal arch was constructed at the west end. A museum recording the destruction stands nearby today.

The country's second capital city was superseded by Rome six years later, after the withdrawal of the French troops allowed the capture of Rome .

20th century [ edit ] Porte Sante cemetery, burial place of notable figures of Florentine history During World War II the city experienced a year-long German occupation (1943–1944) being part of the Italian Social Republic . The Germans operated a subcamp of the Stalag 337 prisoner-of-war camp in the city.

[ 32 ] Hitler declared it an open city on 3 July 1944 as troops of the British 8th Army closed in.

[ 33 ] Except for the Ponte Vecchio , [ 34 ] in early August, the retreating Germans decided to demolish all the bridges along the Arno linking the district of Oltrarno to the rest of the city, making it difficult for troops of the 8th Army to cross.

1/5 Mahratta Light Infantry, Florence, 28 August 1944 Florence was liberated by New Zealand , South African and British troops on 4 August 1944 alongside partisans from the Tuscan Committee of National Liberation (CTLN). The Allied soldiers who died driving the Germans from Tuscany are buried in cemeteries outside the city (Americans about nine kilometres or 5 + 1 ⁄ 2 miles south of the city, British and Commonwealth soldiers a few kilometres east of the centre on the right bank of the Arno).

At the end of World War II in May 1945, the US Army's Information and Educational Branch was ordered to establish an overseas university campus for demobilised American service men and women in Florence. The first American university for service personnel was established in June 1945 at the School of Aeronautics. Some 7,500 soldier-students were to pass through the university during its four one-month sessions (see G. I. American Universities ).

[ 35 ] In November 1966, the Arno flooded parts of the centre, damaging many art treasures. Around the city there are tiny placards on the walls noting where the flood waters reached at their highest point.

Geography [ edit ] Florence with snow cover in December 2009 Florence lies in a basin formed by the hills of Careggi , Fiesole , Settignano , Arcetri , Poggio Imperiale and Bellosguardo (Florence). The Arno river , three other minor rivers (Mugnone, [ 36 ] Ema and Greve) and some streams flow through it.

[ 37 ] Climate [ edit ] Florence has a humid subtropical climate ( Cfa ), tending to Mediterranean ( Csa ).

[ 38 ] It has hot summers with moderate or light rainfall and cool, damp winters. As Florence lacks a prevailing wind, summer temperatures are higher than along the coast. Rainfall in summer is convectional , while relief rainfall dominates in the winter.

Snow is rare.

[ 39 ] The highest officially recorded temperature was 42.6 °C (108.7 °F) on 26 July 1983 and the lowest was −23.2 °C (−9.8 °F) on 12 January 1985.

[ 57 ] In 2013, Florence was listed as the second best world city by Condé Nast Traveler .

[ 58 ] Manufacturing and commerce remain highly important. Florence is Italy's 17th richest city in terms of average workers' earnings, with the figure being €23,265 (the overall city's income is €6,531,204,473), coming after Mantua , yet surpassing Bolzano .

[ 59 ] Industry, commerce and services [ edit ] Florence is a major production and commercial centre in Italy, where the Florentine industrial complexes in the suburbs produce all sorts of goods, from furniture, rubber goods, chemicals, and food.

[ 10 ] Traditional and local products, such as antiques, handicrafts, glassware, leatherwork, art reproductions, jewellery, souvenirs, elaborate metal and iron-work, shoes, accessories and high fashion clothes also occupy a fair sector of Florence's economy.

[ 10 ] The city's income relies partially on services and commercial and cultural interests, such as annual fairs, theatrical and lyrical productions, art exhibitions, festivals and fashion shows, such as the Calcio Fiorentino . Heavy industry and machinery also take their part in providing an income. In Nuovo Pignone, numerous factories are still present, and small-to medium industrial businesses are dominant. The Florence-Prato-Pistoia industrial districts and areas were known as the 'Third Italy' in the 1990s, due to the exports of high-quality goods and automobile (especially the Vespa ) and the prosperity and productivity of the Florentine entrepreneurs. Some of these industries even rivalled the traditional industrial districts in Emilia-Romagna and Veneto due to high profits and productivity.

[ 10 ] In the fourth quarter of 2015, manufacturing increased by 2.4% and exports increased by 7.2%. Leading sectors included mechanical engineering, fashion, pharmaceutics, food and wine. During 2015, permanent employment contracts increased by 48.8 percent, boosted by nationwide tax break.

[ 57 ] Tourism [ edit ] Tourists flock to the Fontana del Porcellino .

Tourism is the most significant industry in central Florence. From April to October, tourists outnumber the local population. Tickets to the Uffizi and Accademia galleries are regularly sold out and large groups regularly fill the basilicas of Santa Croce and Santa Maria Novella , both of which charge for entry. Tickets for The Uffizi and Accademia can be purchased online prior to visiting.

[ 60 ] In 2010, readers of Travel + Leisure magazine ranked the city as their third favourite tourist destination.

[ 61 ] In 2015, Condé Nast Travel readers voted Florence as the best city in Europe.

[ 62 ] Studies by Euromonitor International have concluded that cultural and history-oriented tourism is generating significantly increased spending throughout Europe.

[ 63 ] Florence is believed to have the greatest concentration of art (in proportion to its size) in the world.

[ 64 ] Thus, cultural tourism is particularly strong, with world-renowned museums such as the Uffizi selling over 1.93 million tickets in 2014.

[ 65 ] The city's convention centre facilities were restructured during the 1990s and host exhibitions, conferences, meetings, social forums, concerts and other events.

Tourists and restaurant on the Piazza del Duomo In 2016, Florence had 20,588 hotel rooms in 570 facilities. International visitors use 75% of the rooms; some 18% of those were from the U.S.

[ 66 ] In 2014, the city had 8.5 million overnight stays.

[ 67 ] A Euromonitor report indicates that in 2015 the city ranked as the world's 36th most visited in the world, with over 4.95 million arrivals for the year.

[ 68 ] Tourism brings revenue to Florence, but also creates certain problems. The Ponte Vecchio, The San Lorenzo Market and Santa Maria Novella are plagued by pickpockets.

[ 69 ] The province of Florence receives roughly 13 million visitors per year [ 70 ] and in peak seasons, popular locations may become overcrowded as a result.

[ 71 ] In 2015, Mayor Dario Nardella expressed concern over visitors who arrive on buses, stay only a few hours, spend little money but contribute significantly to overcrowding. "No museum visit, just a photo from the square, the bus back and then on to Venice ... We don't want tourists like that", he said.

[ 72 ] Some tourists are less than respectful of the city's cultural heritage, according to Nardella. In June 2017, he instituted a programme of spraying church steps with water to prevent tourists from using such areas as picnic spots. While he values the benefits of tourism, he claims that there has been "an increase among those who sit down on church steps, eat their food and leave rubbish strewn on them", he explained.

[ 73 ] To boost the sale of traditional foods, the mayor had introduced legislation (enacted in 2016) that requires restaurants to use typical Tuscan products and rejected McDonald's application to open a location in the Piazza del Duomo.

[ 74 ] In October 2021, Florence was shortlisted for the European Commission 's 2022 European Capital of Smart Tourism award along with Bordeaux , Copenhagen , Dublin , Ljubljana , Palma de Mallorca and Valencia .

[ 75 ] Food and wine production [ edit ] Fiaschi of basic Chianti Food and wine have long been an important staple of the economy. The Chianti region is just south of the city, and its Sangiovese grapes figure prominently not only in its Chianti Classico wines but also in many of the more recently developed Supertuscan blends. Within 32 km (20 mi) to the west is the Carmignano area, also home to flavourful sangiovese-based reds. The celebrated Chianti Rufina district, geographically and historically separated from the main Chianti region, is also few kilometres east of Florence. More recently, the Bolgheri region (about 150 km or 93 mi southwest of Florence) has become celebrated for its " Super Tuscan " reds such as Sassicaia and Ornellaia .

[ 76 ] Government [ edit ] See also: List of mayors of Florence The traditional boroughs of the whole comune of Florence The 5 administrative boroughs of the whole comune of Florence The legislative body of the municipality is the City Council ( Consiglio Comunale ), which is composed of 36 councillors elected every five years with a proportional system, at the same time as the mayoral elections. The executive body is the City Committee ( Giunta Comunale ), composed of 7 assessors , nominated and presided over by a directly elected Mayor . The current mayor of Florence is Sara Funaro .

The municipality of Florence is subdivided into five administrative Boroughs ( Quartieri ). Each borough is governed by a Council ( Consiglio ) and a President, elected at the same time as the city mayor. The urban organisation is governed by the Italian Constitution (art. 114). The boroughs have the power to advise the Mayor with nonbinding opinions on a large spectrum of topics (environment, construction, public health, local markets) and exercise the functions delegated to them by the City Council; in addition they are supplied with an autonomous funding in order to finance local activities. The boroughs are: Q1 – Centro storico (Historic Centre); population: 67,170; Q2 – Campo di Marte ; population: 88,588; Q3 – Gavinana- Galluzzo ; population: 40,907; Q4 – Isolotto- Legnaia ; population: 66,636; Q5 – Rifredi; population: 103,761.

All of the five boroughs are governed by the Democratic Party .

The former Italian Prime Minister (2014–2016), Matteo Renzi , served as mayor from 2009 to 2014.

Culture [ edit ] Art [ edit ] Main articles: Florentine painting , Florentine Renaissance art , and Italian Renaissance sculpture See also: Guilds of Florence Botticelli 's Birth of Venus , Uffizi Florence was the birthplace of High Renaissance art, which lasted from about 1500 to 1527. Renaissance art put a larger emphasis on naturalism and human emotion.

[ 77 ] Medieval art was often formulaic and symbolic; the surviving works are mostly religious, their subjects were chosen by clerics. By contrast, Renaissance art became more rational, mathematical, individualistic, [ 77 ] and was produced by known artists such as Donatello , Michelangelo , and Raphael , who started to sign their works. Religion was important, but with this new age came the humanization [ 78 ] [ 79 ] of religious figures in art, such as in Masaccio 's Expulsion from the Garden of Eden and Raphael's Madonna della Seggiola ; people of this age began to understand themselves as human beings, which reflected in art.

[ 79 ] The Renaissance marked the rebirth of classical values in art and society as people studied the ancient masters of the Greco-Roman world; [ 78 ] art became focused on realism as opposed to idealism.

[ 79 ] The Loggia dei Lanzi displays sculptures Michelangelo 's David Cimabue and Giotto , the fathers of Italian painting, lived in Florence, as did Arnolfo di Cambio and Andrea Pisano , renewers of architecture and sculpture; Filippo Brunelleschi , Donatello and Masaccio, forefathers of the Renaissance, Lorenzo Ghiberti and the Della Robbia family, Filippo Lippi and Fra Angelico ; Sandro Botticelli , Paolo Uccello and the universal genius of Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo.

[ 80 ] [ 81 ] Their works, together with those of many other generations of artists, are gathered in the city's many museums : the Uffizi Gallery , the Galleria Palatina with the paintings of the "Golden Ages", [ 82 ] the Bargello with the sculptures of the Renaissance, the museum of San Marco with Fra Angelico 's works, the Galleria dell'Accademia , the Medici Chapels , [ 83 ] the museum of Orsanmichele , the Casa Buonarroti with sculptures by Michelangelo, the Museo Bardini , the Museo Horne , the Museo Stibbert , the Palazzo Corsini , the Galleria d'Arte Moderna , the Museo dell'Opera del Duomo , the Tesoro dei Granduchi and the Museo dell'Opificio delle Pietre Dure .

[ 84 ] Several monuments are located in Florence: the Baptistery with its mosaics ; the cathedral with its sculptures, the medieval churches with bands of frescoes; public as well as private palaces – the Palazzo Vecchio , the Palazzo Pitti, the Palazzo Medici Riccardi , the Palazzo Davanzati and the Casa Martelli ; monasteries, cloisters, refectories; the Certosa . The Museo Archeologico Nazionale documents Etruscan civilization .

[ 85 ] The city is so rich in art that some visitors experience Stendhal syndrome as they encounter its art for the first time.

[ 86 ] The Uffizi Gallery is the 10th most visited art museum in the world.

Florentine architects such as Filippo Brunelleschi (1377–1466) and Leon Battista Alberti (1404–1472) were among the fathers of Renaissance architecture.

[ 87 ] The cathedral, topped by Brunelleschi's dome, dominates the Florentine skyline. The Florentines decided to start building it late in the 13th century, without a design for the dome. The project proposed by Brunelleschi in the 14th century was the largest ever built at the time, and the first major dome built in Europe since the two great domes of Roman times – the Pantheon in Rome, and Hagia Sophia in Constantinople . The dome of Santa Maria del Fiore remains the largest brick construction of its kind in the world.

[ 88 ] [ 89 ] In front of it is the medieval Baptistery. The two buildings incorporate in their decoration the transition from the Middle Ages to the Renaissance. In recent years, most of the important works of art from the two buildings – and from the nearby Giotto's Campanile , have been removed and replaced by copies. The originals are now housed in the Museo dell'Opera del Duomo, just to the east of the cathedral.

Florence has a large number of art-filled churches, such as San Miniato al Monte , San Lorenzo , Santa Maria Novella , Santa Trinita , Santa Maria del Carmine , Santa Croce , Santo Spirito , Santissima Annunziata , Ognissanti and numerous others.

[ 10 ] Palazzo Vecchio Artists associated with Florence range from Arnolfo di Cambio and Cimabue to Giotto , Nanni di Banco , and Paolo Uccello ; through Lorenzo Ghiberti , and Donatello and Masaccio and the della Robbia family; through Fra Angelico and Sandro Botticelli and Piero della Francesca , and on to Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo . Others include Benvenuto Cellini , Andrea del Sarto , Benozzo Gozzoli , Domenico Ghirlandaio , Filippo Lippi , Bernardo Buontalenti , Orcagna , Antonio and Piero del Pollaiuolo , Filippino Lippi , Andrea del Verrocchio , Bronzino , Desiderio da Settignano , Michelozzo , Cosimo Rosselli , the Sangallos, and Pontormo . Artists from other regions who worked in Florence include Raphael , Andrea Pisano , Giambologna , Il Sodoma and Peter Paul Rubens .

Brunelleschi's dome Picture galleries in Florence include the Uffizi and the Palazzo Pitti . Two superb collections of sculpture are in the Bargello and the Museo dell'Opera del Duomo . They are filled with the creations of Donatello, Verrocchio, Desiderio da Settignano, Michelangelo and others. The Galleria dell'Accademia has Michelangelo's David , which was created between 1501 and 1504 and is perhaps the best-known work of art anywhere, plus the unfinished statues of slaves Michelangelo created for the tomb of Pope Julius II .

[ 90 ] [ 91 ] Other sights include the medieval city hall, the Palazzo della Signoria (also known as the Palazzo Vecchio ), the National Archeological Museum , the Museo Galileo , the Palazzo Davanzati , the Museo Stibbert , the Museo Nazionale di San Marco , the Medici Chapels , the Museo dell'Opera di Santa Croce, the Museum of the Cloister of Santa Maria Novella, the Zoological Museum (" La Specola "), the Museo Bardini , and the Museo Horne . There is also a collection of works by the modern sculptor, Marino Marini , in a museum named after him . The Palazzo Strozzi is the site of special exhibitions.

[ 92 ] Language [ edit ] Main article: Florentine dialect See also: Tuscan language Florentine ( fiorentino ), spoken by inhabitants of Florence and its environs, is a Tuscan dialect and the immediate parent language to modern Italian.

Although its vocabulary and pronunciation are largely identical to standard Italian, differences do exist. The Vocabolario del fiorentino contemporaneo (Dictionary of Modern Florentine) reveals lexical distinctions from all walks of life.

[ 93 ] Dante, Petrarch, and Boccaccio pioneered the use of the vernacular [ 94 ] instead of the Latin used for most literary works at the time.

Literature [ edit ] The introduction of the Decameron (1350–1353) by Giovanni Boccaccio Despite Latin being the main language of the courts and the Church in the Middle Ages, writers such as Dante Alighieri [ 94 ] and many others used their own language, the Florentine vernacular descended from Latin, in composing their greatest works. The oldest literary pieces written in Florentine go as far back as the 13th century. Florence's literature fully blossomed in the 14th century, when not only Dante with his Divine Comedy (1306–1321) and Petrarch, but also poets such as Guido Cavalcanti and Lapo Gianni composed their most important works.

[ 94 ] Dante's masterpiece is the Divine Comedy , which mainly deals with the poet himself taking an allegoric and moral tour of Hell, Purgatory and finally Heaven, during which he meets numerous mythological or real characters of his age or before. He is first guided by the Roman poet Virgil , whose non-Christian beliefs damned him to Hell. Later on he is joined by Beatrice , who guides him through Heaven.

[ 94 ] In the 14th century, Petrarch [ 95 ] and Giovanni Boccaccio [ 95 ] led the literary scene in Florence after Dante's death in 1321. Petrarch was an all-rounder writer, author and poet, but was particularly known for his Canzoniere , or the Book of Songs, where he conveyed his unremitting love for Laura.

[ 95 ] His style of writing has since become known as Petrarchism .

[ 95 ] Boccaccio was better known for his Decameron , a slightly grim story of Florence during the 1350s bubonic plague, known as the Black Death , when some people fled the ravaged city to an isolated country mansion, and spent their time there recounting stories and novellas taken from the medieval and contemporary tradition. All of this is written in a series of 100 distinct novellas.

[ 95 ] In the 16th century, during the Renaissance, Florence was the home town of political writer and philosopher Niccolò Machiavelli, whose ideas on how rulers should govern the land, detailed in The Prince , spread across European courts and enjoyed enduring popularity for centuries. These principles became known as Machiavellianism .

Music [ edit ] Main article: Music of Florence See also: Music of Tuscany The Teatro della Pergola Florence became a musical centre during the Middle Ages and music and the performing arts remain an important part of its culture. The growth of Northern Italian Cities in the 1500s likely contributed to its increased prominence. During the Renaissance, there were four kinds of musical patronage in the city with respect to both sacred and secular music: state, corporate, church, and private. It was here that the Florentine Camerata convened in the mid-16th century and experimented with setting tales of Greek mythology to music and staging the result—in other words, the first operas, setting the wheels in motion not just for the further development of the operatic form, but for later developments of separate "classical" forms such as the symphony and concerto. After the year 1600, Italian trends prevailed across Europe, by 1750 it was the primary musical language. The genre of the Madrigal , born in Italy, gained popularity in Britain and elsewhere. Several Italian cities were "larger on the musical map than their real-size for power suggested. Florence, was once such city which experienced a fantastic period in the early seventeenth Century of musico-theatrical innovation, including the beginning and flourishing of opera.

[ 96 ] Opera was invented in Florence in the late 16th century when Jacopo Peri 's Dafne an opera in the style of monody , was premiered. Opera spread from Florence throughout Italy and eventually Europe. Vocal Music in the choir setting was also taking new identity at this time. At the beginning of the 17th century, two practices for writing music were devised, one the first practice or Stile Antico /Prima Prattica the other the Stile Moderno /Seconda Prattica . The Stile Antico was more prevalent in Northern Europe and Stile Moderno was practiced more by the Italian Composers of the time.

[ 97 ] The piano was invented in Florence in 1709 by Bartolomeo Cristofori. Composers and musicians who have lived in Florence include Piero Strozzi (1550 – after 1608), Giulio Caccini (1551–1618) and Mike Francis (1961–2009). Giulio Caccini's book Le Nuove Musiche was significant in performance practice technique instruction at the time.

[ 96 ] The book specified a new term, in use by the 1630s, called monody which indicated the combination of voice and basso continuo and connoted a practice of stating text in a free, lyrical, yet speech-like manner. This would occur while an instrument, usually a keyboard type such as harpsichord , played and held chords while the singer sang/spoke the monodic line.

[ 98 ] Cinema [ edit ] Florence has been a setting for numerous works of fiction and movies, including the novels and associated films, such as Light in the Piazza , The Girl Who Couldn't Say No , Calmi Cuori Appassionati , Hannibal , A Room with a View , Tea with Mussolini , Virgin Territory and Inferno . The city is home to renowned Italian actors and actresses, such as Roberto Benigni , Leonardo Pieraccioni and Vittoria Puccini .

Video games [ edit ] Florence has appeared as a location in video games such as Assassin's Creed II .

[ 99 ] The Republic of Florence also appears as a playable nation in Paradox Interactive 's grand strategy game Europa Universalis IV .

Other media [ edit ] 16th-century Florence is the setting of the Japanese manga and anime series Arte .

Cuisine [ edit ] Florentine steak in Florence Florentine food grows out of a tradition of peasant fare rather than rarefied high cuisine. The majority of dishes are based on meat. The whole animal was traditionally eaten; tripe ( trippa ) and stomach ( lampredotto ) were once regularly on the menu at restaurants and still are sold at the food carts stationed throughout the city.

Antipasti include crostini toscani , sliced bread rounds topped with a chicken liver-based pâté , and sliced meats (mainly prosciutto and salame , often served with melon when in season). The typically saltless Tuscan bread, obtained with natural levain frequently features in Florentine courses, especially in its soups, ribollita and pappa al pomodoro , or in the salad of bread and fresh vegetables called panzanella that is served in summer. The bistecca alla fiorentina is a large (the customary size should weigh around 1.2 to 1.5 kg or 2 lb 10 oz to 3 lb 5 oz) – the "date" steak – T-bone steak of Chianina beef cooked over hot charcoal and served very rare with its more recently derived version, the tagliata , sliced rare beef served on a bed of arugula , often with slices of Parmesan cheese on top. Most of these courses are generally served with local olive oil , also a prime product enjoying a worldwide reputation.

[ 100 ] Among the desserts, schiacciata alla fiorentina , a white flatbread cake, is one of the most popular; it is a very soft cake, prepared with extremely simple ingredients, typical of Florentine cuisine, and is especially eaten at Carnival .

Research activity [ edit ] UNICEF Innocenti Research Centre Research institutes and university departments are located within the Florence area and within two campuses at Polo di Novoli and Polo Scientifico di Sesto Fiorentino [ 101 ] as well as in the Research Area of Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche .

[ 102 ] Science and discovery [ edit ] A display of proboscideans in the Museo di Storia Naturale di Firenze , or the Natural History Museum of Florence Florence has been an important scientific centre for centuries, notably during the Renaissance with scientists such as Leonardo da Vinci.

Florentines were one of the driving forces behind the Age of Discovery . Florentine bankers financed Henry the Navigator and the Portuguese explorers who pioneered the route around Africa to India and the Far East. It was a map drawn by the Florentine Paolo dal Pozzo Toscanelli , a student of Brunelleschi, that Christopher Columbus used to sell his "enterprise" to the Spanish monarchs, and which he used on his first voyage. Mercator's "Projection" is a refined version of Toscanelli's, taking the Americas into account.

Galileo and other scientists pioneered the study of optics, ballistics, astronomy, anatomy, and other scientific disciplines. Pico della Mirandola, Leonardo Bruni, Machiavelli, and many others laid the groundwork for modern scientific understanding.

Fashion [ edit ] Main article: Italian fashion See also: Fashion designers of Florence and Polimoda Luxury boutiques along Florence's prestigious Via de' Tornabuoni By the year 1300 Florence had become a centre of textile production in Europe. Many of the rich families in Renaissance Florence were major purchasers of locally produced fine clothing, and the specialists of fashion in the economy and culture of Florence during that period is often underestimated.

[ 103 ] Florence is regarded by some as the birthplace and earliest centre of the modern (post World War Two) fashion industry in Italy. The Florentine "soirées" of the early 1950s organised by Giovanni Battista Giorgini were events where several Italian designers participated in group shows and first garnered international attention.

[ 104 ] Florence has served as the home of the Italian fashion company Salvatore Ferragamo since 1928.

Gucci , Roberto Cavalli , and Emilio Pucci are also headquartered in Florence. Other major players in the fashion industry such as Prada and Chanel have large offices and stores in Florence or its outskirts. Florence's main upscale shopping street is Via de' Tornabuoni , where major luxury fashion houses and jewellery labels, such as Armani and Bulgari , have boutiques. Via del Parione and Via Roma are other streets that are also well known for their high-end fashion stores.

[ 105 ] Historical evocations [ edit ] Scoppio del Carro [ edit ] The Scoppio del Carro ("Explosion of the Cart") is a celebration of the First Crusade . During the day of Easter, a cart, which the Florentines call the Brindellone and which is led by four white oxen, is taken to the Piazza del Duomo between the Baptistery of St. John the Baptist ( Battistero di San Giovanni ) and the Florence Cathedral ( Santa Maria del Fiore ). The cart is connected by a rope to the interior of the church. Near the cart there is a model of a dove, which, according to legend, is a symbol of good luck for the city: at the end of the Easter mass, the dove emerges from the nave of the Duomo and ignites the fireworks on the cart.

[ 106 ] Calcio Storico [ edit ] See also: Calcio Fiorentino Calcio Storico Calcio Storico Fiorentino ("Historic Florentine Football "), sometimes called Calcio in costume , is a traditional sport, regarded as a forerunner of soccer, though the actual gameplay most closely resembles rugby. The event originates from the Middle Ages , when the most important Florentine nobles amused themselves playing while wearing bright costumes. The most important match was played on 17 February 1530, during the siege of Florence . That day Papal troops besieged the city while the Florentines, with contempt of the enemies, decided to play the game notwithstanding the situation. The game is played in the Piazza di Santa Croce . A temporary arena is constructed, with bleachers and a sand-covered playing field. A series of matches are held between four teams representing each quartiere (quarter) of Florence during late June and early July.

[ 107 ] There are four teams: Azzurri (light blue), Bianchi (white), Rossi (red) and Verdi (green). The Azzurri are from the quarter of Santa Croce, Bianchi from the quarter of Santo Spirito, Verdi are from San Giovanni and Rossi from Santa Maria Novella.

Main sights [ edit ] Main article: Architecture of Florence Florence is known as the "Cradle of the Renaissance" ( la culla del Rinascimento ) for its monuments, churches, and buildings. The best-known site of Florence is the domed cathedral of the city, Santa Maria del Fiore , known as The Duomo , whose dome was built by Filippo Brunelleschi . The nearby Campanile (partly designed by Giotto ) and the Baptistery buildings are also highlights. The dome, 600 years after its completion, is still the largest dome built in brick and mortar in the world.

[ 108 ] In 1982, the historic centre of Florence (Italian: centro storico di Firenze ) was declared a World Heritage Site by the UNESCO .

[ 109 ] The centre of the city is contained in medieval walls that were built in the 14th century to defend the city. At the heart of the city, in Piazza della Signoria , is Bartolomeo Ammannati 's Fountain of Neptune (1563–1565), which is a masterpiece of marble sculpture at the terminus of a still functioning Roman aqueduct .

The layout and structure of Florence in many ways harkens back to the Roman era, where it was designed as a garrison settlement.

[ 10 ] Nevertheless, the majority of the city was built during the Renaissance.

[ 10 ] Despite the strong presence of Renaissance architecture within the city, traces of medieval , Baroque , Neoclassical and modern architecture can be found. The Palazzo Vecchio as well as the Duomo, or the city's Cathedral, are the two buildings which dominate Florence's skyline.

[ 10 ] The river (Arno), which cuts through the old part of the city, is as much a character in Florentine history as many of the people who lived there. Historically, the locals have had a love-hate relationship with the Arno – which alternated between nourishing the city with commerce, and destroying it by flood.

One of the bridges in particular stands out – the Ponte Vecchio ('Old Bridge'), whose most striking feature is the multitude of shops built upon its edges, held up by stilts. The bridge also carries Vasari's elevated corridor linking the Uffizi to the Medici residence ( Palazzo Pitti ). Although the original bridge was constructed by the Etruscans , the current bridge was rebuilt in the 14th century. It is the only bridge in the city to have survived World War II intact. It is the first example in the western world of a bridge built using segmental arches , that is, arches less than a semicircle, to reduce both span-to-rise ratio and the numbers of pillars to allow lesser encumbrance in the riverbed (being in this much more successful than the Roman Alconétar Bridge ).

The church of San Lorenzo contains the Medici Chapels , a complex of burial chapels of the Medici family —the most powerful family in Florence from the 15th to the 18th centuries.

The Uffizi Gallery, one of the finest art museums in the world, was founded on a large bequest from the last member of the Medici family. It is located at the corner of Piazza della Signoria , a site important for being the centre of Florence's civil life and government for centuries. The Palazzo della Signoria facing it is still home of the municipal government. Many significant episodes in the history of art and political changes were staged here, such as: In 1301, Dante Alighieri was sent into exile from here (commemorated by a plaque on one of the walls of the Uffizi).

On 26 April 1478, Jacopo de' Pazzi and his retainers tried to raise the city against the Medici after the plot known as La congiura dei Pazzi ( The Pazzi conspiracy ), murdering Giuliano di Piero de' Medici and wounding his brother Lorenzo. All the members of the plot who could be apprehended were seized by the Florentines and hanged from the windows of the palace.

In 1497, it was the location of the Bonfire of the vanities instigated by the Dominican friar and preacher Girolamo Savonarola .

On 23 May 1498, the same Savonarola and two followers were hanged and burnt at the stake. A round plate in the ground marks the spot where he was hanged.

In 1504, Michelangelo's David (now replaced by a replica, since the original was moved in 1873 to the Galleria dell'Accademia ) was installed in front of the Palazzo della Signoria (also known as Palazzo Vecchio ).

The Loggia dei Lanzi in Piazza della Signoria is the location of a number of statues by other sculptors such as Donatello , Giambologna , Bartolomeo Ammannati and Benvenuto Cellini , although some have been replaced with copies to preserve the originals.

Further information: Villa Pitiana Monuments, museums and religious buildings [ edit ] See also: List of churches in Florence and Theatres in Florence Baptistry, cathedral and campanile Piazzale degli Uffizi Florence contains several palaces and buildings from various eras. The Palazzo Vecchio is the town hall of Florence and also an art museum. This large Romanesque crenellated fortress-palace overlooks the Piazza della Signoria with its copy of Michelangelo's David statue as well as the gallery of statues in the adjacent Loggia dei Lanzi . Originally called the Palazzo della Signoria , after the Signoria of Florence , the ruling body of the Republic of Florence , it was also given several other names: Palazzo del Popolo , Palazzo dei Priori , and Palazzo Ducale , in accordance with the varying use of the palace during its long history. The building acquired its current name when the Medici duke's residence was moved across the Arno to the Palazzo Pitti. It is linked to the Uffizi and the Palazzo Pitti through the Corridoio Vasariano .

Palazzo Medici, now called Medici Riccardi , designed by Michelozzo di Bartolomeo for Cosimo il Vecchio , of the Medici family, is another major edifice, and was built between 1445 and 1460. It was well known for its stone masonry that includes rustication and ashlar . Today it is the head office of the Metropolitan City of Florence and hosts museums and the Riccardiana Library . The Palazzo Strozzi , an example of civil architecture with its rusticated stone, was inspired by the Medici palace, but with more harmonious proportions. Today the palace is used for international expositions like the annual antique show (founded as the Biennale dell'Antiquariato in 1959), fashion shows and other cultural and artistic events. Here also is the seat of the Istituto Nazionale del Rinascimento and the noted Gabinetto Vieusseux , with the library and reading room.

There are several other notable places, including the Palazzo Rucellai , designed by Leon Battista Alberti between 1446 and 1451 and executed, at least in part, by Bernardo Rossellino ; the Palazzo Davanzati , which houses the museum of the Old Florentine House; the Palazzo Spini Feroni , on Piazza Santa Trinità , a historic 13th-century private palace, owned since the 1920s by shoe-designer Salvatore Ferragamo ; as well as various others, including the Palazzo Borghese, the Palazzo di Bianca Cappello , the Palazzo Antinori , and the Palazzo delle Assicurazioni Generali , designed in the Neo-Renaissance style in 1871.

Palazzo Pitti on Boboli Gardens ' side Florence contains numerous museums and art galleries where some of the world's most important works of art are held. The city is one of the best preserved Renaissance centres of art and architecture in the world and has a high concentration of art, architecture and culture.

[ 110 ] In the ranking list of the 15 most visited Italian art museums, two-thirds are represented by Florentine museums.
