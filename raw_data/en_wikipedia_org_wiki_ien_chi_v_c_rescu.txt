A polyglot , he was able to speak Ancient and Modern Greek , Old Church Slavonic , Arabic , Persian , French , German , Italian , and Ottoman Turkish .

Biography [ edit ] Văcărescu wrote one of the first printed books on Romanian grammar in 1787, an edition which also included a section dedicated to the study of prosody ; it was titled Observaţii sau băgări de seamă asupra regulilor şi orânduielilor gramaticii româneşti ("Observations or Reckonings on the Rules and Dispositions of Romanian Grammar"). He also completed a work on Greek grammar ( Gramatica greacă completă ).

[ 2 ] Ienăchiţă Văcărescu's Romanian grammar Văcărescu's lyrical works take inspiration from both Anacreon and folklore , and center on romantic love . The best-known poems he left behind are Amărâta turturea ("Embittered Turtle Dove") and the minuscule Într-o grădină ("In a Garden"). Aside from these, he was also the author of a Istorie a Preaputernicilor Împăraţi Otomani ("History of the All Mighty Ottoman Emperors ").

[ 3 ] On several occasions, Ienăchiţă Văcărescu served Wallachia as a diplomat in missions abroad, including negotiations carried out in the Habsburg realms for the sons of Prince Alexander Ypsilantis to return after their 1782 flight to Vienna ; he met and conversed with Emperor Joseph II , and also befriended the French ambassador, Baron de Breteuil . His impressive knowledge of Italian was the subject of a 1929 study by historian Nicolae Iorga , De unde a învăţat italieneşte Ienăchiţă Văcărescu ("Where Has Ienăchiţă Văcărescu Learned His Italian From?").
