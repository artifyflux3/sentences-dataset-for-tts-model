[ 1 ] It emphasises a mutual line of inquiry of the past and present to understand how discrete historical events fit into wider societal progress and ongoing dilemmas through complementary comparative analysis.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] Looking at how social structures are changed and reproduced , historical sociology strives to understand the visible mechanisms and hidden structures that hinder certain parts of human development, whilst allowing other parts to thrive.

[ 4 ] Throughout this, it challenges the ahistoricism of modern sociology as a discipline, [ 5 ] [ 6 ] of the limited engagement with the past in studying social structures, whilst simultaneously critiquing the disengagement of historical study with the differences between societies and the broader social patterns between historical events.

[ 4 ] [ 7 ] This interdisciplinary field operates within a spectrum between history and sociology with a 'sociology of history' residing at one end and a 'history of society' residing at another. A diverse range of people can be found throughout this spectrum that explore history through a sociological lens compared to others that dissect society through its historical events.

[ 8 ] Although valid lines of research, they are based on singular disciplinary approaches and are reductionist in nature. In the middle of this spectrum historical sociology can be found that works to intertwine these mono-discipline efforts into an interdisciplinary approach.

Origins [ edit ] As time has passed, history and sociology have developed into two different specific academic disciplines. Historical data was used and is used today in mainly these three ways: examining a theory through a parallel investigation, applying and contrasting events or policies (such as Verstehen ), and considering the causalities from a macro point of view.

John Stuart Mill 's method: " a) principle of difference: a case with effect and cause present is contrasted with a case with effect and cause absent; and b) principle of agreement: cases with same effects are compared in terms of their (ideally identical) causes. There is an important debate on the usefulness of Mill's method for sociological research, which relates to the fact that historical research is often based on only few cases and that many sociological theories are probabilistic, not deterministic.

[ 9 ] Today, historical sociology is measured by a conjunction of questions that are rich in detail.

[ 10 ] Themes [ edit ] Human agency [ edit ] A shared theme of sociology and history is accounting for the paradox of human agency. "The problem of agency is the problem of finding a way to account for human experience which recognises simultaneously and in equal measure that history and society are made by constant and more or less purposeful individual action and that individual action, however purposeful, is made by history and society".

[ 11 ] This theme is presented across authors from Marx to Spencer where a symbiotic relation enables action to create structure, whilst that structure defines action.

[ 11 ] Here, historical sociology outlines that the key to understanding our human agency is to track its development over time. Better enabling us to see the changes and continuations of actions and structures that shape human agency throughout our societies.

Comparative historical sociology [ edit ] Contemporary historical sociology is primarily concerned with how the state has developed since the Middle Ages , analysing relations between states, classes, economic and political systems.

Impact on other disciplines [ edit ] International relations [ edit ] Main article: International Relations Historical sociology has become an increasingly used approach in international relations to draw upon the reflective usefulness of historical sociology in exploring the past and present together, challenging unhistorical viewpoints in the field that stem from realist and neoliberalism paradigms that often see the wider structural makeup of the world as static.

[ 12 ] Political economy [ edit ] Main article: Political Economy The work of political economy aims to reconcile the development of political and economic systems for insight into policy. Historical sociology critiques political economy for (1) viewing the present as a natural structure, (2) focus on history as a path dependent outcome, and (3) shaping their insights around prominent figures with limited engagement of wider processes and "regular" people.
