 The internal view of a Mission Cyrus One hi-fi integrated audio amplifier (1984)[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_amplifier#cite_note-1)

An **audio power amplifier** (or **power amp**) [amplifies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_amplifier "Electronic amplifier") low-power electronic [audio signals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_signal "Audio signal"), such as the signal from a [radio receiver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_receiver "Radio receiver") or an electric guitar [pickup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickup_(music_technology) "Pickup (music technology)"), to a level that is high enough for driving [loudspeakers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudspeaker "Loudspeaker") or [headphones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headphones "Headphones"). Audio power amplifiers are found in all manner of sound systems including [sound reinforcement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_reinforcement "Sound reinforcement"), [public address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_address "Public address"), [home audio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_audio "Home audio") systems and musical [instrument amplifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrument_amplifier "Instrument amplifier") like [guitar amplifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar_amplifier "Guitar amplifier"). It is the final electronic stage in a typical audio playback [chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_chain "Signal chain") before the signal is sent to the loudspeakers.

The preceding stages in such a chain are low-power audio amplifiers which perform tasks like [pre-amplification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preamplifier "Preamplifier") of the signal, [equalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equalization_(audio) "Equalization (audio)"), [mixing different input signals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixing_console "Mixing console"). The inputs can also be any number of audio sources like [record players](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_player "Record player"), [CD players](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD_player "CD player"), [digital audio players](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio_player "Digital audio player") and [cassette players](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassette_player "Cassette player"). Most audio power amplifiers require these low-level inputs, which are [line level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_level "Line level").

While the input signal to an audio power amplifier, such as the signal from an electric guitar, may measure only a few hundred [microwatts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt "Watt"), its output may be a few watts for small consumer electronics devices, such as [clock radios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_radio "Clock radio"), tens or hundreds of watts for a [home stereo system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_stereo_system "Home stereo system"), several thousand watts for a [nightclub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightclub "Nightclub")'s sound system or tens of thousands of watts for a large rock concert sound reinforcement system. While power amplifiers are available in standalone units, typically aimed at the [hi-fi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hi-fi "Hi-fi") audiophile market (a niche market) of audio enthusiasts and sound reinforcement system professionals, many [consumer electronics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_electronics "Consumer electronics") audio products such as an [integrated amplifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_amplifier "Integrated amplifier"), a [receiver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_(radio) "Receiver (radio)"), clock radios, [boomboxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boombox "Boombox") and [televisions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television "Television") have both a preamplifier and a power amplifier contained in a single chassis.

De Forest's prototype audio amplifier of 1914

The audio amplifier was invented around 1912 by [Lee de Forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_de_Forest "Lee de Forest"). This was made possible by his invention of the first practical amplifying electrical component, the [triode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triode "Triode")[vacuum tube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_tube "Vacuum tube") (or "valve" in British English) in 1907. The [triode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triode "Triode") was a three-terminal device with a control grid that can modulate the flow of electrons from the filament to the plate. The triode [vacuum amplifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve_amplifier "Valve amplifier") was used to make the first [AM radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AM_radio "AM radio").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_amplifier#cite_note-2) Early audio power amplifiers were based on vacuum tubes and some of these achieved notably high audio quality (e.g., the [Williamson amplifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williamson_amplifier "Williamson amplifier") of 1947–9).

[McIntosh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McIntosh_Labs "McIntosh Labs") MC240 from 1961, with exposed vacuum tubes

Audio power amplifiers based on [transistors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor "Transistor") became practical with the wide availability of inexpensive transistors in the late 1960s. Since the 1970s, most modern audio amplifiers are based on [solid-state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_electronics "Solid-state electronics") transistors, especially the [bipolar junction transistor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_junction_transistor "Bipolar junction transistor") (BJT) and the [metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal%E2%80%93oxide%E2%80%93semiconductor_field-effect_transistor "Metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor") (MOSFET). Transistor-based amplifiers are lighter in weight, more reliable and require less maintenance than [tube amplifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tube_amplifier "Tube amplifier").

The MOSFET was invented at [Bell Labs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs "Bell Labs") between 1955 and 1960.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_amplifier#cite_note-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_amplifier#cite_note-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_amplifier#cite_note-Lojek1202-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_amplifier#cite_note-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_amplifier#cite_note-7)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_amplifier#cite_note-8) was adapted into a [power MOSFET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_MOSFET "Power MOSFET") for audio by [Jun-ichi Nishizawa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jun-ichi_Nishizawa "Jun-ichi Nishizawa") at [Tohoku University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tohoku_University "Tohoku University") in 1974.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_amplifier#cite_note-Duncan177-9) Power MOSFETs were soon manufactured by [Yamaha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamaha_Corporation "Yamaha Corporation") for their [hi-fi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hi-fi "Hi-fi") audio amplifiers. [JVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JVC "JVC"), [Pioneer Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer_Corporation "Pioneer Corporation"), [Sony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony "Sony") and [Toshiba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toshiba "Toshiba") also began manufacturing amplifiers with power MOSFETs in 1974.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_amplifier#cite_note-Duncan177-9) In 1977, [Hitachi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitachi "Hitachi") introduced the [LDMOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LDMOS "LDMOS") (lateral diffused MOS), a type of power MOSFET. Hitachi was the only LDMOS manufacturer between 1977 and 1983, during which time LDMOS was used in audio power amplifiers from manufacturers such as [HH Electronics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HH_Electronics "HH Electronics") (V-series) and [Ashly Audio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashly_Audio "Ashly Audio"), and were used for music and [public address systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_address_system "Public address system").[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_amplifier#cite_note-Duncan177-9)[Class-D amplifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class-D_amplifier "Class-D amplifier") became successful in the mid-1980s when low-cost, fast-switching MOSFETs were made available.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_amplifier#cite_note-10) Many transistor amps use MOSFET devices in their [power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_electronics "Power electronics") sections, because their [distortion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distortion_(music) "Distortion (music)") curve is more [tube-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tube_sound "Tube sound").[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_amplifier#cite_note-11)

In the 2010s, there are still audio enthusiasts, musicians (particularly [electric guitarists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_guitar "Electric guitar"), [electric bassists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_bass "Electric bass"), [Hammond organ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammond_organ "Hammond organ") players and [Fender Rhodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fender_Rhodes "Fender Rhodes")[electric piano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_piano "Electric piano") players, among others), audio engineers and [music producers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_producer "Music producer") who prefer tube-based amplifiers, and what is perceived as a "warmer" [tube sound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tube_sound "Tube sound").

[![Image 5](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Professional_PA_power_amps_from_Crest_Audio_and_QSC_with_control_modules_in_rack.jpg/250px-Professional_PA_power_amps_from_Crest_Audio_and_QSC_with_control_modules_in_rack.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Professional_PA_power_amps_from_Crest_Audio_and_QSC_with_control_modules_in_rack.jpg)

Five rack-mounted audio power amplifiers used in a [sound reinforcement system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_reinforcement_system "Sound reinforcement system")

Key design parameters for audio power amplifiers are [frequency response](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_response "Frequency response"), [gain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gain_(electronics) "Gain (electronics)"), [noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_(electronics) "Noise (electronics)"), and [distortion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distortion "Distortion"). These are interdependent; increasing gain often leads to undesirable increases in noise and distortion. While [negative feedback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_feedback "Negative feedback") actually reduces the gain, it also reduces distortion. Most audio amplifiers are linear amplifiers operating in [class AB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_amplifier_classes "Power amplifier classes").

Until the 1970s, most amplifiers used [vacuum tubes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_tube "Vacuum tube"). During the 1970s, tube amps were increasingly replaced with [transistor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor "Transistor")-based amplifiers, which were lighter in weight, more reliable, and lower maintenance. Nevertheless, tube preamplifiers are still sold in [niche markets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niche_market "Niche market"), such as with home [hi-fi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hi-fi "Hi-fi") enthusiasts, [audio engineers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_engineer "Audio engineer") and [music producers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_producer "Music producer") (who use tube preamplifiers in studio recordings to "warm up" microphone signals) and electric guitarists, electric bassists and [Hammond organ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammond_organ "Hammond organ") players, of whom a minority continue to use tube preamps, tube power amps and tube [effects units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_unit "Effects unit"). While hi-fi enthusiasts and audio engineers doing live sound or monitoring tracks in the studio typically seek out amplifiers with the lowest distortion, electric instrument players in genres such as [blues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blues "Blues"), [rock music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music "Rock music") and [heavy metal music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metal_music "Heavy metal music"), among others, use tube amplifiers because they like the natural overdrive that tube amps produce when pushed hard.

The [class-D amplifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class-D_amplifier "Class-D amplifier"), which is much more efficient than class-AB amplifiers, is now widely used in [consumer electronics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_electronics "Consumer electronics") audio products, [bass amplifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_amplifier "Bass amplifier") and [sound reinforcement system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_reinforcement_system "Sound reinforcement system") gear, as class-D amplifiers are much lighter in weight and produce much less heat, but may introduce some noise.

Filters and preamplifiers
-------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Audio_power_amplifier&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Filters and preamplifiers")]

Since modern digital devices, including CD and DVD players, radio receivers and tape decks already provide a "flat" signal at line level, the preamp is not needed other than as a volume control and source selector. One alternative to a separate preamp is to simply use passive volume and switching controls, sometimes integrated into a power amplifier to form an [integrated amplifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_amplifier "Integrated amplifier").

Power output stages
-------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Audio_power_amplifier&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Power output stages")]

[![Image 6](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/Micro_amplifier_%28booster%29_FIIO_Fujiyama_for_smartphone_etc._headphones.jpg/250px-Micro_amplifier_%28booster%29_FIIO_Fujiyama_for_smartphone_etc._headphones.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Micro_amplifier_(booster)_FIIO_Fujiyama_for_smartphone_etc._headphones.jpg)

A micro audio amplifier for boosting the output of [line level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_level "Line level") sources to [headphones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headphone "Headphone") or small speakers. Edge length 4 cm, mass 16[g](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram "Gram"), power output about 100 mW into a 32 Ω load.

The final stage of amplification, after preamplifiers, is the output stage, where the highest demands are placed on the transistors or tubes. For this reason, the design choices made around the output device (for single-ended output stages, such as in [single-ended triode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-ended_triode "Single-ended triode") amplifiers) or devices (for [push-pull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push%E2%80%93pull_output "Push–pull output") output stages), such as the [class of operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplifier#Power_amplifier_classes "Amplifier") of the output devices is often taken as the description of the whole power amplifier. For example, a class-B amplifier will probably have just the high power output devices operating cut off for half of each cycle, while the other devices (such as differential amplifier, voltage amplifier and possibly even driver transistors) operate in class A. In a [transformerless output stage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Output_transformerless "Output transformerless"), the devices are essentially in series with the power supply and output [load](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_load "Electrical load") (such as a loudspeaker), possibly via some large capacitor and/or small resistances.

Further developments
--------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Audio_power_amplifier&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Further developments")]

For some years following the introduction of solid-state amplifiers, their perceived sound did not have the excellent audio quality of the best valve amplifiers (see [valve audio amplifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve_audio_amplifier "Valve audio amplifier")). This led [audiophiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audiophile "Audiophile") to believe that "tube sound" or [valve sound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve_sound "Valve sound") had an intrinsic quality due to the vacuum tube technology itself. In 1970, [Matti Otala](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Matti_Otala&action=edit&redlink=1 "Matti Otala (page does not exist)") published a paper on the origin of a previously unobserved form of distortion: transient [intermodulation distortion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermodulation_distortion "Intermodulation distortion") (TIM),[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_amplifier#cite_note-12) later also called [slew-induced distortion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slew-induced_distortion "Slew-induced distortion") (SID) by others.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_amplifier#cite_note-13) TIM distortion was found to occur during very rapid increases in amplifier output voltage.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_amplifier#cite_note-14)

TIM did not appear at steady state sine tone measurements, helping to hide it from design engineers prior to 1970. Problems with TIM distortion stem from reduced open loop frequency response of solid-state amplifiers. Further works of Otala and other authors found the solution for TIM distortion, including increasing [slew rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slew_rate "Slew rate"), decreasing preamp frequency bandwidth, and the insertion of a lag compensation circuit in the input stage of the amplifier.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_amplifier#cite_note-15)[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_amplifier#cite_note-16)[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_amplifier#cite_note-17) In high-quality modern amplifiers the open loop response is at least 20 kHz, canceling TIM distortion.

The next step in advanced design was the Baxandall Theorem, created by Peter Baxandall in England.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_amplifier#cite_note-18) This theorem introduced the concept of comparing the ratio between the input distortion and the output distortion of an amplifier. This new idea helped audio design engineers to better evaluate the distortion processes within an amplifier.

Pyle two-channel power amplifier

Rear panel of a medium-sized [sound reinforcement system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_reinforcement_system "Sound reinforcement system") located at one side of the stage at a pop concert. The setup includes the [mixing console](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixing_console "Mixing console") for the [sound engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_engineer "Sound engineer") (standing behind) and the power amplifiers which are partly stacked in a 19-inch rack on the right.

Important applications include [public address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_address "Public address") systems, theatrical and concert [sound reinforcement systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_reinforcement_system "Sound reinforcement system"), and domestic systems such as a [stereo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_fidelity "High fidelity") or [home-theatre system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_cinema "Home cinema"). [Instrument amplifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrument_amplifier "Instrument amplifier") including [guitar amplifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar_amplifier "Guitar amplifier") and electric [keyboard amplifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_amplifier "Keyboard amplifier") also use audio power amplifiers. In some cases, the power amplifier for an instrument amplifier is integrated into a single amplifier "head" which contains a preamplifier, tone controls, and electronic effects. These components may be mounted in a wooden speaker cabinet to create a "combo amplifier". Musicians with unique performance needs and/or a need for very powerful amplification may create a custom setup with separate [rackmount](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rackmount "Rackmount") preamplifiers, equalizers, and a power amplifier mounted in a 19" [road case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_case "Road case").

Power amplifiers are available in standalone units, which are used by [hi-fi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hi-fi "Hi-fi") audio enthusiasts and designers of [public address systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_address_system "Public address system") (PA systems) and [sound reinforcement systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_reinforcement_system "Sound reinforcement system"). A hi-fi user of power amplifiers may have a stereo power amplifier to drive left and right speakers and a single-channel (mono) power amplifier to drive a [subwoofer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subwoofer "Subwoofer"). The number of power amplifiers used in a sound reinforcement setting depends on the size of the venue. A small [coffeehouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffeehouse "Coffeehouse") may have a single power amp driving two PA speakers. A [nightclub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightclub "Nightclub") may have several power amps for the main speakers, one or more power amps for the [monitor speakers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foldback_(sound_engineering) "Foldback (sound engineering)") (pointing towards the band) and an additional power amp for the subwoofer. A stadium concert may have a large number of power amps mounted in racks. Most [consumer electronics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_electronics "Consumer electronics") sound products, such as [TVs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV "TV"), [boom boxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boom_box "Boom box"), [home cinema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_cinema "Home cinema") sound systems, Casio and Yamaha [electronic keyboards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_keyboard "Electronic keyboard"), ["combo" guitar amps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar_amplifier "Guitar amplifier") and car stereos have power amplifiers integrated inside the chassis of the main product.
