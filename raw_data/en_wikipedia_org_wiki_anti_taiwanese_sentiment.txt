disability Social privilege Christian male white Social stigma Speciesism Stereotype The talk v t e Anti-Taiwanese sentiment refers to the general dislike or hatred of the Taiwanese people or Taiwanese culture . Anti-Taiwanese sentiment (反臺灣) is often related to but can be distinct from sentiments against Taiwan independence (反臺獨).

People's Republic of China [ edit ] In the 21st century, anti-Taiwan Jingoism has emerged rapidly in the People's Republic of China , particularly on the Chinese internet.

[ 1 ] The Chinese government has at times denied that anti-Taiwanese sentiment is present in mainland China, insisting that residents are only opposed to Taiwanese independence. In 2016, the Taiwan Affairs Office declared that "there is no anti-Taiwan sentiment among the people in mainland China, only anti-Taiwan independence".

[ 2 ] However, scholars have pointed to examples of Chinese netizens attacking Taiwanese people and culture to argue that anti-Taiwanese sentiment is a growing trend on the Chinese internet.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] The China Times published an editorial in 2016 arguing that "anti-China" sentiment had long been present in Taiwan and that "anti-Taiwanese independence" sentiment had long been present in China, but that "anti-Taiwan" sentiment in Chinese civil society was a new and growing phenomenon.

[ 5 ] In 2018, a spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office blamed Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party for "triggering the emotions" of mainland netizens while insisting that anti-Taiwanese sentiment was not representative of China's stance.

[ 6 ] Chinese authorities have also attempted to discourage anti-Taiwan rhetoric.

Ma Xiaoguang , spokesperson for China's Taiwan Affairs Office , declared in 2021 that mainland netizens should "fight against Taiwanese independence" but not against Taiwan.

[ 7 ] During a coordinated campaign in 2016 by Chinese internet users to leave anti-independence messages on the Facebook page of newly elected president Tsai Ing-wen , organizers unsuccessfully insisted that participants should only attack the idea of Taiwanese independence rather than Taiwanese people or culture.

[ 4 ] [ page needed ] Relationship with anti-Chinese sentiment [ edit ] Main articles: Anti-Chinese sentiment and Anti-Han sentiment Anti-Taiwanese sentiment is sometimes motivated by anti-Chinese sentiment because of the existence of a perception that Taiwanese is ethnically close to Chinese ; [ 8 ] during the 2014 Vietnam anti-China protests , anti-Taiwanese sentiment emerged as an extension of anti-Chinese sentiment.

[ 9 ] In contrast, politically pro-China attitudes sometimes lead to anti-Taiwan.

[ vague ] [ 10 ] See also [ edit ] 2022 Laguna Woods shooting Chinese imperialism Pro-Taiwanese sentiment " Spiritually Japanese ", a ethnic slur used by anti-Japanese mainland Chinese to demean Taiwanese who are more friendly to Japan.
