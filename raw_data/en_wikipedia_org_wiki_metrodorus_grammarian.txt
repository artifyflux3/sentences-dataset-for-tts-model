Nothing is known about the life of Metrodorus. The time he lived is not certain: he may have lived as early as the 3rd century AD, but it is more likely that he lived in the time of the emperors Anastasius I and Justin I , in the early 6th century.

[ 1 ] His name occurs in connection with 45 mathematical epigrams which are to be found in book 14 of the Greek Anthology .

[ 2 ] Although he may have authored some of the epigrams, it is generally accepted that he collected most of them, and some of them may predate the 5th century BC.

[ 1 ] Many of the epigrams lead to simple equations, and they are of the same type as those found in the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus (17th century BC).

[ 3 ] Among the problems Metrodorus collected are: [ 3 ] Twenty-three simple equations with one unknown, one of which is the famous epigram which reveals the age of Diophantus .

[ 4 ] Twelve are easy simultaneous equations with two unknowns.

One gives a simultaneous equation with three unknowns.

[ 5 ] Six are problems about filling and emptying vessels by pipes.
