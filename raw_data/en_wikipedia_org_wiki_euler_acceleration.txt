The Euler acceleration (named for Leonhard Euler ), also known as azimuthal acceleration [ 2 ] or transverse acceleration , [ 3 ] is that part of the absolute acceleration that is caused by the variation in the angular velocity of the reference frame .

[ 4 ] Intuitive example [ edit ] The Euler force will be felt by a person riding a merry-go-round . As the ride starts, the Euler force will be the apparent force pushing the person to the back of the horse; and as the ride comes to a stop, it will be the apparent force pushing the person towards the front of the horse. A person on a horse close to the perimeter of the merry-go-round will perceive a greater apparent force than a person on a horse closer to the axis of rotation.

Mathematical description [ edit ] Main article: Rotating reference frame The direction and magnitude of the Euler acceleration is given, in the rotating reference frame, by: a E u l e r = − − d ω ω d t × × r , {\displaystyle \mathbf {a} _{\mathrm {Euler} }=-{\frac {d{\boldsymbol {\omega }}}{dt}}\times \mathbf {r} ,} where ω is the angular velocity of rotation of the reference frame and r is the vector position of the point in the reference frame. The Euler force on an object of mass m in the rotating reference frame is then F E u l e r = m a E u l e r = − − m d ω ω d t × × r .

{\displaystyle \mathbf {F} _{\mathrm {Euler} }=m\mathbf {a} _{\mathrm {Euler} }=-m{\frac {d{\boldsymbol {\omega }}}{dt}}\times \mathbf {r} .} See also [ edit ] Fictitious force Coriolis effect Centrifugal force Rotating reference frame Angular acceleration Notes and references [ edit ] ^ Jerrold E.
