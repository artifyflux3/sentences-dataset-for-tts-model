[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] The primary sector tends to make up a larger portion of the economy in developing countries than it does in developed countries . For example, in 2018, agriculture, forestry, and fishing comprised more than 15% of GDP in sub-Saharan Africa [ 4 ] but less than 1% of GDP in North America .

[ 5 ] In developed countries the primary sector has become more technologically advanced, enabling for example the mechanization of farming, as compared with lower-tech methods [ a ] in poorer countries.

[ 6 ] More developed economies may invest additional capital in primary means of production: for example, in the United States Corn Belt , combine harvesters pick the corn, and sprayers spray large amounts of insecticides , herbicides and fungicides , producing a higher yield than is possible using less capital-intensive techniques. These technological advances and investment allow the primary sector to employ a smaller workforce, so developed countries tend to have a smaller percentage of their workforce involved in primary activities, instead having a higher percentage involved in the secondary and tertiary sectors.
