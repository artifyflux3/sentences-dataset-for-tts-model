( Discuss ) Proposed since June 2025.

A superglass is hypothetical phase of matter which is characterized by superfluidity and a frozen amorphous structure at the same time.

[ 1 ] This idea was put forward by Anthony James Leggett in 1970.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] In 2009, J.C. Séamus Davis theorised that frozen helium-4 (at 0.2 K and 50 atm) may be a superglass.
