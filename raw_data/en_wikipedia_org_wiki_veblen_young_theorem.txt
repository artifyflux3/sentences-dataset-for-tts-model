Non-Desarguesian planes give examples of 2-dimensional projective spaces that do not arise from vector spaces over division rings, showing that the restriction to dimension at least 3 is necessary.

Jacques Tits generalized the Veblen–Young theorem to Tits buildings , showing that those of rank at least 3 arise from algebraic groups .

John von Neumann ( 1998 ) generalized the Veblen–Young theorem to continuous geometry , showing that a complemented modular lattice of order at least 4 is isomorphic to the principal right ideals of a von Neumann regular ring .

Statement [ edit ] A projective space S can be defined abstractly as a set P (the set of points), together with a set L of subsets of P (the set of lines), satisfying these axioms : Each two distinct points p and q are in exactly one line.

Veblen's axiom: If a , b , c , d are distinct points and the lines through ab and cd meet, then so do the lines through ac and bd .

Any line has at least 3 points on it.

The Veblen–Young theorem states that  if the dimension of a projective space is at least 3 (meaning that there are two non-intersecting lines) then  the  projective space is isomorphic with the projective space of lines in a vector space  over some division ring K .
