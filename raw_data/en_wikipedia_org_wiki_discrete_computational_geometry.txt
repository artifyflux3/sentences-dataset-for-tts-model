Founded in 1986 by Jacob E. Goodman and Richard M. Pollack , the journal publishes articles on discrete geometry and computational geometry .

Abstracting and indexing [ edit ] The journal is indexed in: Mathematical Reviews Zentralblatt MATH Science Citation Index Current Contents Notable articles [ edit ] Two articles published in Discrete & Computational Geometry , one by Gil Kalai in 1992 with a proof of a subexponential upper bound on the diameter of a polytope [ 1 ] and another by Samuel Ferguson in 2006 on the Kepler conjecture on optimal three-dimensional sphere packing , [ 2 ] earned their authors the Fulkerson Prize .
