Function symbols are used, together with constants and variables, to form terms .

The theory of uninterpreted functions is also sometimes called the free theory , because it is freely generated, and thus a free object , or the empty theory , being the theory having an empty set of sentences (in analogy to an initial algebra ).  Theories with a non-empty set of equations are known as equational theories . The satisfiability problem for free theories is solved by syntactic unification ; algorithms for the latter are used by interpreters for various computer languages, such as Prolog . Syntactic unification is also used in algorithms for the satisfiability problem for certain other equational theories, see Unification (computer science) .

Example [ edit ] As an example of uninterpreted functions for SMT-LIB , if this input is given to an SMT solver : (declare-fun f (Int) Int) (assert (= (f 10) 1)) the SMT solver would return "This input is satisfiable".  That happens because f is an uninterpreted function (i.e., all that is known about f is its signature ), so it is possible that f(10) = 1 . But by applying the input below: (declare-fun f (Int) Int) (assert (= (f 10) 1)) (assert (= (f 10) 42)) the SMT solver would return "This input is unsatisfiable". That happens because f , being a function, can never return different values for the same input.

Discussion [ edit ] The decision problem for free theories is particularly important, because many theories can be reduced by it.

[ 3 ] Free theories can be solved by searching for common subexpressions to form the congruence closure .

[ clarification needed ] Solvers include satisfiability modulo theories solvers.
