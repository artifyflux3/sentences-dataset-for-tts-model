While probability measures always assign the value 1 to the underlying set, sub-probability measures assign a value lesser than or equal to 1 to the underlying set.

Definition [ edit ] Let μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } be a measure on the measurable space ( X , A ) {\displaystyle (X,{\mathcal {A}})} .

Then μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } is called a sub-probability measure if μ μ ( X ) ≤ ≤ 1 {\displaystyle \mu (X)\leq 1} .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Properties [ edit ] In measure theory, the following implications hold between measures: probability ⟹ ⟹ sub-probability ⟹ ⟹ finite ⟹ ⟹ σ σ -finite {\displaystyle {\text{probability}}\implies {\text{sub-probability}}\implies {\text{finite}}\implies \sigma {\text{-finite}}} So every probability measure is a sub-probability measure, but the converse is not true. Also every sub-probability measure is a finite measure and a σ-finite measure , but the converse is again not true.
