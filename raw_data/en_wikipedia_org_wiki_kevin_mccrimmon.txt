He is known for his introduction of quadratic Jordan algebras in 1966.

McCrimmon attended secondary school in Champaign-Urbana, Illinois and then received his bachelor's degree in mathematics in 1960 from Reed College in Portland, Oregon .

[ 1 ] He received his Ph.D. from Yale University in 1965 with thesis Norms and Noncommutative Jordan Algebras supervised by Nathan Jacobson .

[ 2 ] McCrimmon spent his final year as a graduate student at the University of Chicago, [ 1 ] when Nathan Jacobson spent a year of unpaid leave visiting Chicago and Japan for the academic year 1964–1965.

[ 3 ] As a postdoc, McCrimmon was at Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 1965 to 1967, for one year as an Air Force Research Laboratory Postdoctoral Fellow and for the next year as a C. L. E. Moore instructor . He became in 1967 a member of the Center for Advanced Studies at the University of Virginia (UVA), in 1968 an associate professor at UVA, and in 1972, a full professor at UVA, retiring there as professor emeritus.

[ 1 ] He was chair of the mathematics department from 1972 to 1975.

[ 1 ] McCrimmon was a Sloan Fellow in 1968 and an Invited Speaker of the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1974 in Vancouver.

[ 4 ] He spent several years on sabbatical in Europe.

[ 1 ] He was elected a Fellow of the American Mathematical Society in 2017.
