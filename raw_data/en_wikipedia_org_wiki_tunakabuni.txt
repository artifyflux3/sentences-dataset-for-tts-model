He based his large Persian compendium of simple and compound remedies, which according to the text was composed in 1679, on Arabic authorities and on Indian sources. His treatise was dedicated to Shah Sulayman , who ruled from 1666 to 1694.  Grandfathers of him emigrated from Tonekabon to Isfahan and were special healers of the kings of the Safavid dynasty. Tunakabuni was also the special doctor of King Soleiman and had skill in medicine and language. He wrote his famous book, Tohfat AL-mo'menin , for king Soleiman.
