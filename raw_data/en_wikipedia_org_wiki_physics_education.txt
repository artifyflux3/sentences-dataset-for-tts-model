 You deserve an explanation 

August 17: An important update for readers in the United States. 

Please don't skip this 1-minute read. It's Sunday, August 17, and we're running a short fundraiser to support Wikipedia. If you've lost count of how many times you've visited Wikipedia this year, we hope that means it's given you at least $2.75 of knowledge. Please join the 2% of readers who give what they can to keep this valuable resource ad-free and available for all.

After nearly 25 years, Wikipedia is still the internet we were promised—created by people, not by machines. It's not perfect, but it's not here to push a point of view. It's owned by a non-profit, not a giant technology company or a billionaire.

Most readers donate because Wikipedia is useful to them, others because Wikipedia is more important than ever. If you feel the same, please donate $2.75 now—or consider a monthly gift to help all year. Thank you.

Set of methods to teach physics

Not to be confused with [Physical education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_education "Physical education").

For the academic journal, see [Physics Education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics_Education "Physics Education").

**Physics education** or **physics teaching** refers to the [education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education "Education") methods currently used to [teach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching "Teaching")[physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics"). The occupation is called **physics educator** or **physics teacher**. [Physics education research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics_education_research "Physics education research") refers to an area of pedagogical research that seeks to improve those methods. Historically, physics has been taught at the high school and college level primarily by the lecture method together with laboratory exercises aimed at verifying concepts taught in the lectures. These concepts are better understood when lectures are accompanied with demonstration, hand-on experiments, and questions that require students to ponder what will happen in an experiment and why. Students who participate in [active learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_learning "Active learning") for example with hands-on experiments learn through self-discovery. By trial and error they learn to change their preconceptions about phenomena in physics and discover the underlying concepts. Physics education is part of the broader area of [science education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_education "Science education").

History
-------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Physics_education&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: History")]

In [Ancient Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece "Ancient Greece"), [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle "Aristotle") wrote what is considered now as the first textbook of physics.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics_education#cite_note-1) Aristotle's ideas were taught unchanged until the [Late Middle Ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Middle_Ages "Late Middle Ages"), when scientists started making discoveries that didn't fit them. For example, [Copernicus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copernicus "Copernicus")' discovery contradicted Aristotle's idea of an Earth-centric universe. Aristotle's ideas about motion weren't displaced until the end of the 17th century, when [Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton") published his ideas.

Today's physics students often think of physics concepts in Aristotelian terms, despite being taught only Newtonian concepts.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics_education#cite_note-2)

Teaching strategies
-------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Physics_education&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Teaching strategies")]

Teaching strategies are the various techniques used to facilitate the education of students with different [learning styles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_styles "Learning styles"). The different teaching strategies are intended to help students develop critical thinking and engage with the material. The choice of teaching strategy depends on the concept being taught, and indeed on the interest of the students.

**Methods/Approaches for teaching physics**

*   **Lecture:** Lecturing is one of the more traditional ways of teaching science. Owing to the convenience of this method, and the fact that most teachers are taught by it, it remains popular in spite of certain limitations (compared to other methods, it does little to develop critical thinking and scientific attitude among students). This method is teacher centric.
*   **Recitation:** Also known as the [Socratic method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method "Socratic method"). In this method, the student plays a greater role than they would in a lecture. The teacher asks questions with the aim of prompting the thoughts of the students. This method can be very effective in developing higher order thinking in pupils. To apply this strategy, the students should be partially informed about the content. The efficacy of the recitation method depends largely on the quality of the questions. This method is student centric.
*   **Demonstration:** In this method, the teacher performs certain experiments, which students observe and ask questions about. After the demonstration, the teacher can explain the experiment further and test the students' understanding via questions. This method is an important one, as science is not an entirely theoretical subject.
*   **Lecture-cum-Demonstration:** As its name suggests, this is a combination of two of the above methods: lecture and demonstration. The teacher performs the [experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment "Experiment") and explains it simultaneously. By this method, the teacher can provide more information in less time. As with the demonstration method, the students only observe; they do not get any practical experience of their own. It is not possible to teach all topics by this method.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics_education#cite_note-3)
*   **Laboratory Activities:** Laboratories have students conduct physics experiments and collect data by interacting with physics equipment. Generally, students follow instructions in a lab manual. These instructions often take students through an experiment step-by-step. Typical [learning objectives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_aims_and_objectives "Educational aims and objectives") include reinforcing the course content through real-world interaction (similar to demonstrations) and thinking like [experimental physicists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_physics "Experimental physics"). Lately, there has been some effort to shift lab activities toward the latter objective by separating from the course content, having students make their own decisions, and calling to question the notion of a "correct" experimental result. Unlike the demonstration method, the laboratory method gives students practical experience performing experiments like professional scientists. However, it often requires a significant amount of time and resources to work properly.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics_education#cite_note-4)
*   **Problem-based learning:** A group of 8-10 students and a tutor meet together to study a "case" or trigger problem. One student acts as a chair and one as a scribe to record the session. Students interact to understand the terminology and issues of the problem, discussing possible solutions and a set of learning objectives. The group breaks up for private study then return to share results. The approach has been used in many UK medical schools. The technique fosters independence, engagement, development of communication skill, and integration of new knowledge with real world issues. However, the technique requires more staff per student, staff willing to facilitate rather than lecture, and well designed and documented trigger scenarios.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics_education#cite_note-5) The technique has been shown to be effective in teaching physics.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics_education#cite_note-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics_education#cite_note-7)
