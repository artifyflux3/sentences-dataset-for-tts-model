The Prüfer p -groups are countable abelian groups that are important in the classification of infinite abelian groups: they (along with the group of rational numbers ) form the smallest building blocks of all divisible groups .

The groups are named after Heinz Prüfer , a German mathematician of the early 20th century.

Constructions of Z ( p ∞ ) [ edit ] The Prüfer p -group may be identified with the subgroup of the circle group , U(1), consisting of all p n -th roots of unity as n ranges over all non-negative integers: Z ( p ∞ ∞ ) = { exp ⁡ ⁡ ( 2 π π i m / p n ) ∣ ∣ 0 ≤ ≤ m < p n , n ∈ ∈ Z + } = { z ∈ ∈ C ∣ ∣ z ( p n ) = 1 for some n ∈ ∈ Z + } .

{\displaystyle \mathbf {Z} (p^{\infty })=\{\exp(2\pi im/p^{n})\mid 0\leq m<p^{n},\,n\in \mathbf {Z} ^{+}\}=\{z\in \mathbf {C} \mid z^{(p^{n})}=1{\text{ for some }}n\in \mathbf {Z} ^{+}\}.\;} The group operation here is the multiplication of complex numbers .

There is a presentation Z ( p ∞ ∞ ) = ⟨ ⟨ g 1 , g 2 , g 3 , … … ∣ ∣ g 1 p = 1 , g 2 p = g 1 , g 3 p = g 2 , … … ⟩ ⟩ .

{\displaystyle \mathbf {Z} (p^{\infty })=\langle \,g_{1},g_{2},g_{3},\ldots \mid g_{1}^{p}=1,g_{2}^{p}=g_{1},g_{3}^{p}=g_{2},\dots \,\rangle .} Here, the group operation in Z ( p ∞ ) is written as multiplication.

Alternatively and equivalently, the Prüfer p -group may be defined as the Sylow p -subgroup of the quotient group Q / Z , consisting of those elements whose order is a power of p : Z ( p ∞ ∞ ) = Z [ 1 / p ] / Z {\displaystyle \mathbf {Z} (p^{\infty })=\mathbf {Z} [1/p]/\mathbf {Z} } (where Z [1/ p ] denotes the group of all rational numbers whose denominator is a power of p , using addition of rational numbers as group operation).

For each natural number n , consider the quotient group Z / p n Z and the embedding Z / p n Z → Z / p n +1 Z induced by multiplication by p . The direct limit of this system is Z ( p ∞ ): Z ( p ∞ ∞ ) = lim → → ⁡ ⁡ Z / p n Z .

{\displaystyle \mathbf {Z} (p^{\infty })=\varinjlim \mathbf {Z} /p^{n}\mathbf {Z} .} If we perform the direct limit in the category of topological groups , then we need to impose a topology on each of the Z / p n Z {\displaystyle \mathbf {Z} /p^{n}\mathbf {Z} } , and take the final topology on Z ( p ∞ ∞ ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {Z} (p^{\infty })} . If we wish for Z ( p ∞ ∞ ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {Z} (p^{\infty })} to be Hausdorff , we must impose the discrete topology on each of the Z / p n Z {\displaystyle \mathbf {Z} /p^{n}\mathbf {Z} } , resulting in Z ( p ∞ ∞ ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {Z} (p^{\infty })} to have the discrete topology.

We can also write Z ( p ∞ ∞ ) = Q p / Z p {\displaystyle \mathbf {Z} (p^{\infty })=\mathbf {Q} _{p}/\mathbf {Z} _{p}} where Q p denotes the additive group of p -adic numbers and Z p is the subgroup of p -adic integers.

Properties [ edit ] The complete list of subgroups of the Prüfer p -group Z ( p ∞ ) = Z [1/ p ]/ Z is: 0 ⊊ ⊊ ( 1 p Z ) / Z ⊊ ⊊ ( 1 p 2 Z ) / Z ⊊ ⊊ ( 1 p 3 Z ) / Z ⊊ ⊊ ⋯ ⋯ ⊊ ⊊ Z ( p ∞ ∞ ) {\displaystyle 0\subsetneq \left({1 \over p}\mathbf {Z} \right)/\mathbf {Z} \subsetneq \left({1 \over p^{2}}\mathbf {Z} \right)/\mathbf {Z} \subsetneq \left({1 \over p^{3}}\mathbf {Z} \right)/\mathbf {Z} \subsetneq \cdots \subsetneq \mathbf {Z} (p^{\infty })} Here, each ( 1 p n Z ) / Z {\displaystyle \left({1 \over p^{n}}\mathbf {Z} \right)/\mathbf {Z} } is a cyclic subgroup of Z ( p ∞ ) with p n elements; it contains precisely those elements of Z ( p ∞ ) whose order divides p n and corresponds to the set of p n -th roots of unity.

The Prüfer p -groups are the only infinite groups whose subgroups are totally ordered by inclusion. This sequence of inclusions expresses the Prüfer p -group as the direct limit of its finite subgroups. As there is no maximal subgroup of a Prüfer p -group, it is its own Frattini subgroup .

Given this list of subgroups, it is clear that the Prüfer p -groups are indecomposable (cannot be written as a direct sum of proper subgroups). More is true: the Prüfer p -groups are subdirectly irreducible . An abelian group is subdirectly irreducible if and only if it is isomorphic to a finite cyclic p -group or to a Prüfer group.

The Prüfer p -group is the unique infinite p -group that is locally cyclic (every finite set of elements generates a cyclic group). As seen above, all proper subgroups of Z ( p ∞ ) are finite. The Prüfer p -groups are the only infinite abelian groups with this property.

[ 1 ] The Prüfer p -groups are divisible . They play an important role in the classification of divisible groups; along with the rational numbers they are the simplest divisible groups. More precisely: an abelian group is divisible if and only if it is the direct sum of a (possibly infinite) number of copies of Q and (possibly infinite) numbers of copies of Z ( p ∞ ) for every prime p . The ( cardinal ) numbers of copies of Q and Z ( p ∞ ) that are used in this direct sum determine the divisible group up to isomorphism.

[ 2 ] As an abelian group (that is, as a Z -module ), Z ( p ∞ ) is Artinian but not Noetherian .

[ 3 ] It can thus be used as a counterexample against the idea that every Artinian module is Noetherian (whereas every Artinian ring is Noetherian).

The endomorphism ring of Z ( p ∞ ) is isomorphic to the ring of p -adic integers Z p .

[ 4 ] In the theory of locally compact topological groups the Prüfer p -group (endowed with the discrete topology ) is the Pontryagin dual of the compact group of p -adic integers , and the group of p -adic integers is the Pontryagin dual of the Prüfer p -group.

[ 5 ] See also [ edit ] p -adic integers , which can be defined as the inverse limit of the finite subgroups of the Prüfer p -group.

Dyadic rational , rational numbers of the form a /2 b . The Prüfer 2-group can be viewed as the dyadic rationals modulo 1.
