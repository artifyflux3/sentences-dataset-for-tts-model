There are two references to Leodamas in Proclus 's Commentary on Euclid : [ 1 ] At this time [Plato's time] also lived Leodamas of Thasos, Archytas of Tarentum , and Theaetetus of Athens , by whom the theorems [of geometry] were increased in number and brought into a more scientific arrangement.  Younger than Leodamas was Neoclides and his pupil Leon , who added many discoveries.

Plato, it is said, taught this method [analysis] to Leodamas, who is also reported to have made many discoveries in geometry by means of it.

and one in Diogenes Laërtius ' Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers , Book 3 (Plato): He [Plato] was the first to explain to Leodamas of Thasos the method of solving problems by analysis.
