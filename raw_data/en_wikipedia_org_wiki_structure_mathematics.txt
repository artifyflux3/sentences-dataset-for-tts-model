( April 2016 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) In mathematics , a structure on a set (or on some sets) refers to providing or endowing it (or them) with certain additional features (e.g. an operation , relation , metric , or topology ). Τhe additional features are attached or related to the set (or to the sets), so as to provide it (or them) with some additional meaning or significance.

A partial list of possible structures is measures , algebraic structures ( groups , fields , etc.), topologies , metric structures ( geometries ), orders , graphs , events , differential structures , categories , setoids , and equivalence relations .

Sometimes, a set is endowed with more than one feature simultaneously, which allows mathematicians to study the interaction between the different structures more richly. For example, an ordering imposes a rigid form, shape, or topology on the set, and if a set has both a topology feature and a group feature, such that these two features are related in a certain way, then the structure becomes a topological group .

[ 1 ] Map between two sets with the same type of structure, which preserve this structure [ morphism : structure in the domain is mapped properly to the (same type) structure in the codomain ] is of special interest in many fields of mathematics. Examples are homomorphisms , which preserve algebraic structures; continuous functions , which preserve topological structures; and differentiable functions , which preserve differential structures.

History [ edit ] In 1939, the French group with the pseudonym " Nicolas Bourbaki " saw structures as the root of mathematics. They first mentioned them in their "Fascicule" of Theory of Sets and expanded it into Chapter IV of the 1957 edition.

[ 2 ] They identified three mother structures : algebraic, topological, and order .

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] Example: the real numbers [ edit ] The set of real numbers has several standard structures: An order: each number is either less than or greater than any other number.

Algebraic structure: there are operations of addition and multiplication, the first of which makes it into a group and the pair of which together make it into a field .

A measure: intervals of the real line have a specific length , which can be extended to the Lebesgue measure on many of its subsets .

A metric: there is a notion of distance between points.

A geometry: it is equipped with a metric and is flat .

A topology: there is a notion of open sets .

There are interfaces among these: Its order and, independently, its metric structure induce its topology.

Its order and algebraic structure make it into an ordered field .

Its algebraic structure and topology make it into a Lie group , a type of topological group .
