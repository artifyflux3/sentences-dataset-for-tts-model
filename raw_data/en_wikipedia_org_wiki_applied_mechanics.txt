**Applied mechanics** is the branch of science concerned with the motion of any substance that can be experienced or perceived by humans without the help of instruments.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mechanics#cite_note-:0-1) In short, when mechanics concepts surpass being theoretical and are applied and executed, general mechanics becomes applied mechanics. It is this stark difference that makes applied mechanics an essential understanding for practical everyday life.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mechanics#cite_note-2) It has numerous applications in a wide variety of fields and disciplines, including but not limited to [structural engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_engineering "Structural engineering"), [astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy "Astronomy"), [oceanography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanography "Oceanography"), [meteorology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology "Meteorology"), [hydraulics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulics "Hydraulics"), [mechanical engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_engineering "Mechanical engineering"), [aerospace engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace_engineering "Aerospace engineering"), [nanotechnology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanotechnology "Nanotechnology"), [structural design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_engineering "Structural engineering"), [earthquake engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake_engineering "Earthquake engineering"), [fluid dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_dynamics "Fluid dynamics"), [planetary sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_science "Planetary science"), and other life sciences.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mechanics#cite_note-:1-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mechanics#cite_note-:2-4) Connecting research between numerous disciplines, applied mechanics plays an important role in both [science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science "Science") and [engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering "Engineering").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mechanics#cite_note-:0-1)

Pure mechanics describes the response of bodies (solids and fluids) or systems of bodies to external behavior of a body, in either a beginning state of rest or of motion, subjected to the action of forces. Applied mechanics bridges the gap between physical theory and its application to [technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology "Technology").

Composed of two main categories, Applied Mechanics can be split into [classical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics "Classical mechanics"); the study of the mechanics of macroscopic solids, and [fluid mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_mechanics "Fluid mechanics"); the study of the mechanics of macroscopic fluids.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mechanics#cite_note-:2-4) Each branch of applied mechanics contains subcategories formed through their own subsections as well.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mechanics#cite_note-:2-4)[Classical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics "Classical mechanics"), divided into [statics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statics "Statics") and [dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamics_(mechanics) "Dynamics (mechanics)"), are even further subdivided, with statics' studies split into rigid bodies and rigid structures, and dynamics' studies split into [kinematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinematics "Kinematics") and [kinetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetics_(physics) "Kinetics (physics)").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mechanics#cite_note-:2-4) Like [classical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics "Classical mechanics"), [fluid mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_mechanics "Fluid mechanics") is also divided into two sections: statics and dynamics.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mechanics#cite_note-:2-4)

Within the practical sciences, applied mechanics is useful in formulating new ideas and theories, discovering and interpreting phenomena, and developing experimental and computational tools.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mechanics#cite_note-:3-5) In the application of the [natural sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_science "Natural science"), mechanics was said to be complemented by [thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamics "Thermodynamics"), the study of heat and more generally [energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy "Energy"), and [electromechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromechanics "Electromechanics"), the study of [electricity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity "Electricity") and [magnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism "Magnetism").

Engineering problems are generally tackled with applied mechanics through the application of theories of [classical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics "Classical mechanics") and [fluid mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_mechanics "Fluid mechanics").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mechanics#cite_note-:2-4) Because applied mechanics can be applied in engineering disciplines like [civil engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_engineering "Civil engineering"), [mechanical engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_engineering "Mechanical engineering"), [aerospace engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace_engineering "Aerospace engineering"), materials engineering, and [biomedical engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomedical_engineering "Biomedical engineering"), it is sometimes referred to as engineering mechanics.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mechanics#cite_note-:2-4)

Science and engineering are interconnected with respect to applied mechanics, as researches in science are linked to research processes in civil, mechanical, aerospace, materials and biomedical engineering disciplines.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mechanics#cite_note-:0-1) In [civil engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_engineering "Civil engineering"), applied mechanics’ concepts can be applied to structural design and a variety of engineering sub-topics like structural, coastal, geotechnical, construction, and [earthquake engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake_engineering "Earthquake engineering").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mechanics#cite_note-:2-4) In [mechanical engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_engineering "Mechanical engineering"), it can be applied in mechatronics and [robotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics "Robotics"), design and drafting, [nanotechnology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanotechnology "Nanotechnology"), machine elements, structural analysis, friction stir welding, and [acoustical engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustical_engineering "Acoustical engineering").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mechanics#cite_note-:2-4) In [aerospace engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace_engineering "Aerospace engineering"), applied mechanics is used in aerodynamics, aerospace structural mechanics and propulsion, aircraft design and flight mechanics.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mechanics#cite_note-:2-4) In materials engineering, applied mechanics’ concepts are used in thermoelasticity, [elasticity theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticity_theory "Elasticity theory"), fracture and failure mechanisms, structural design optimisation, fracture and fatigue, active materials and composites, and computational mechanics.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mechanics#cite_note-6) Research in applied mechanics can be directly linked to biomedical engineering areas of interest like orthopaedics; biomechanics; human body motion analysis; soft tissue modelling of muscles, tendons, ligaments, and cartilage; biofluid mechanics; and dynamic systems, performance enhancement, and optimal control.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mechanics#cite_note-7)

The first science with a theoretical foundation based in [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics") was [mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics "Mechanics"); the underlying principles of mechanics were first delineated by [Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton") in his 1687 book _[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophi%C3%A6\_Naturalis\_Principia\_Mathematica "Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica")_[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mechanics#cite_note-:1-3)_._ One of the earliest works to define applied mechanics as its own discipline was the three volume _Handbuch der Mechanik_ written by German physicist and engineer [Franz Josef Gerstner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Josef_Gerstner "Franz Josef Gerstner").[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mechanics#cite_note-:4-8) The first seminal work on applied mechanics to be published in English was A _Manual of Applied Mechanics_ in 1858 by English mechanical engineer [William Rankine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rankine "William Rankine").[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mechanics#cite_note-:4-8)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mechanics#cite_note-9)[August Föppl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_F%C3%B6ppl "August Föppl"), a German mechanical engineer and professor, published _Vorlesungen über technische Mechanik_ in 1898 in which he introduced [calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus "Calculus") to the study of applied mechanics.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mechanics#cite_note-:4-8)

Applied mechanics was established as a discipline separate from [classical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics "Classical mechanics") in the early 1920s with the publication of _[Journal of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journal\_of\_Applied\_Mathematics\_and\_Mechanics "Journal of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics")_, the creation of the Society of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics, and the first meeting of the _[International Congress of Applied Mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International\_Union\_of\_Theoretical\_and\_Applied\_Mechanics "International Union of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics")_.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mechanics#cite_note-:0-1) In 1921 Austrian scientist [Richard von Mises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_von_Mises "Richard von Mises") started the _[Journal of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journal\_of\_Applied\_Mathematics\_and\_Mechanics "Journal of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics")_ (_Zeitschrift für Angewante Mathematik und Mechanik_) and in 1922 with German scientist [Ludwig Prandtl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Prandtl "Ludwig Prandtl") founded the Society of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics ([Gesellschaft für Angewandte Mathematik und Mechanik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gesellschaft_f%C3%BCr_Angewandte_Mathematik_und_Mechanik "Gesellschaft für Angewandte Mathematik und Mechanik")).[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mechanics#cite_note-:0-1) During a 1922 conference on hydrodynamics and aerodynamics in [Innsbruck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innsbruck "Innsbruck"), Austria, [Theodore von Kármán](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_von_K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n "Theodore von Kármán"), a Hungarian engineer, and [Tullio Levi-Civita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tullio_Levi-Civita "Tullio Levi-Civita"), an Italian mathematician, met and decided to organize a conference on applied mechanics.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mechanics#cite_note-:0-1) In 1924 the first meeting of the _[International Congress of Applied Mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International\_Union\_of\_Theoretical\_and\_Applied\_Mechanics "International Union of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics")_ was held in [Delft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delft "Delft"), the Netherlands attended by more than 200 scientist from around the world.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mechanics#cite_note-:0-1)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mechanics#cite_note-:1-3) Since this first meeting the congress has been held every four years, except during [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II"); the name of the meeting was changed to _International Congress of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics_ in 1960.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mechanics#cite_note-:0-1)

Due to the unpredictable political landscape in Europe after the [First World War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I "World War I") and upheaval of World War II many European scientist and engineers emigrated to the United States.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mechanics#cite_note-:0-1) Ukrainian engineer [Stephan Timoshenko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Timoshenko "Stephen Timoshenko") fled the [Bolsheviks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolsheviks "Bolsheviks") Red Army in 1918 and eventually emigrated to the U.S. in 1922; over the next twenty-two years he taught applied mechanics at the [University of Michigan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Michigan "University of Michigan") and [Stanford University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University "Stanford University").[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mechanics#cite_note-:5-10) Timoshenko authored thirteen textbooks in applied mechanics, many considered the gold standard in their fields; he also founded the [Applied Mechanics Division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_Mechanics_Division "Applied Mechanics Division") of the [American Society of Mechanical Engineers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Society_of_Mechanical_Engineers "American Society of Mechanical Engineers") in 1927 and is considered “America’s Father of Engineering Mechanics.”[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mechanics#cite_note-:5-10) In 1930 Theodore von Kármán left Germany and became the first director of the [Aeronautical Laboratory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guggenheim_Aeronautical_Laboratory "Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory") at the [California Institute of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Institute_of_Technology "California Institute of Technology"); von Kármán would later co-found the [Jet Propulsion Laboratory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_Propulsion_Laboratory "Jet Propulsion Laboratory") in 1944.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mechanics#cite_note-:0-1) With the leadership of Timoshenko and von Kármán, the influx of talent from Europe, and the rapid growth of the aeronautical and defense industries, applied mechanics became a mature discipline in the U.S. by 1950.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mechanics#cite_note-:0-1)

Dynamics, the study of the motion and movement of various objects, can be further divided into two branches, [kinematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinematics "Kinematics") and [kinetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetics_(physics) "Kinetics (physics)").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mechanics#cite_note-:2-4) For [classical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics "Classical mechanics"), kinematics would be the analysis of moving bodies using time, [velocities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocities "Velocities"), [displacement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_(geometry) "Displacement (geometry)"), and [acceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration "Acceleration").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mechanics#cite_note-:2-4) Kinetics would be the study of moving bodies through the lens of the effects of forces and masses.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mechanics#cite_note-:2-4) In the context of fluid mechanics, fluid dynamics pertains to the flow and describing of the motion of various fluids.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mechanics#cite_note-:2-4)

The study of statics is the study and describing of bodies at rest.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mechanics#cite_note-:2-4) Static analysis in classical mechanics can be broken down into two categories, non-deformable bodies and deformable bodies.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mechanics#cite_note-:2-4) When studying non-deformable bodies, considerations relating to the forces acting on the rigid structures are analyzed. When studying deformable bodies, the examination of the structure and material strength is observed.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mechanics#cite_note-:2-4) In the context of fluid mechanics, the resting state of the pressure unaffected fluid is taken into account.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mechanics#cite_note-:2-4)

### Newtonian foundation

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Applied_mechanics&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Newtonian foundation")]

Being one of the first sciences for which a systematic theoretical framework was developed, mechanics was spearheaded by Sir Isaac Newton's _Principia_ (published in 1687).[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mechanics#cite_note-:1-3) It is the "divide and rule" strategy developed by Newton that helped to govern motion and split it into dynamics or statics.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mechanics#cite_note-:1-3) Depending on the type of _force_, type of _matter_, and the _external forces,_ acting on said matter, will dictate the "Divide and Rule" strategy within dynamic and static studies.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mechanics#cite_note-:1-3)

### Archimedes' principle

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Applied_mechanics&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Archimedes' principle")]

[Archimedes' principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes%27_principle "Archimedes' principle") is a major one that contains many defining propositions pertaining to fluid mechanics. As stated by proposition 7 of Archimedes' principle, a solid that is heavier than the fluid its placed in, will descend to the bottom of the fluid.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mechanics#cite_note-:6-11) If the solid is to be weighed within the fluid, the fluid will be measured as lighter than the weight of the amount of fluid that was displaced by said solid.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mechanics#cite_note-:6-11) Further developed upon by proposition 5, if the solid is lighter than the fluid it is placed in, the solid will have to be forcibly immersed to be fully covered by the liquid.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mechanics#cite_note-:6-11) The weight of the amount of displaced fluids will then be equal to the weight of the solid.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mechanics#cite_note-:6-11)
