She is a professor of computer science at Bryn Mawr College where she chairs the computer science department.

[ 1 ] Education and career [ edit ] Xu graduated from Smith College in 1996, with a bachelor's degree in computer science.

[ 1 ] She credits going to a women's college with the nurturing environment that allowed her to become interested in computer science.

[ 2 ] She completed her Ph.D. in 2002 in computer and information science at the University of Pennsylvania .

[ 1 ] Her dissertation, Incremental Algorithms for the Design of Triangular-Based Spline Surfaces , was supervised by Jean Gallier .

[ 3 ] After staying at Pennsylvania as a postdoctoral researcher, she joined the Bryn Mawr faculty in 2004.

[ 1 ] Books [ edit ] With Ira Greenberg and Deepak Kumar, Xu is the author of Processing: Creative Coding and Generative Art in Processing 2 (Springer, 2013), a tutorial introduction to Processing , an open-source graphical library and integrated development environment built for the electronic arts, new media art , and visual design communities.
With Jean Gallier , she is the author of A Guide to the Classification Theorem for Compact Surfaces (Springer, 2013).
