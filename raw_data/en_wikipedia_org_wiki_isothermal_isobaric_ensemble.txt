It is also called the N p T {\displaystyle NpT} -ensemble, where the number of particles N {\displaystyle N\,} is also kept as a constant.  This ensemble plays an important role in chemistry as chemical reactions are usually carried out under constant pressure condition.

[ 1 ] The NPT ensemble is also useful for measuring the equation of state of model systems whose virial expansion for pressure cannot be evaluated, or systems near first-order phase transitions.

[ 2 ] In the ensemble, the probability of a microstate i {\displaystyle i} is Z − − 1 e − − β β ( E i + p V i ) {\displaystyle Z^{-1}e^{-\beta (E_{i}+pV_{i})}} , where Z {\displaystyle Z} is the partition function, E i {\displaystyle E_{i}} is the internal energy of the system in microstate i {\displaystyle i} , and V i {\displaystyle V_{i}} is the volume of the system in microstate i {\displaystyle i} .

The probability of a macrostate is Z − − 1 e − − β β ( E + p V − − T S ) = Z − − 1 e − − β β G {\displaystyle Z^{-1}e^{-\beta (E+pV-TS)}=Z^{-1}e^{-\beta G}} , where G {\displaystyle G} is the Gibbs free energy .

Derivation of key properties [ edit ] The partition function for the N p T {\displaystyle NpT} -ensemble can be derived from statistical mechanics by beginning with a system of N {\displaystyle N} identical atoms described by a Hamiltonian of the form p 2 / 2 m + U ( r n ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {p} ^{2}/2m+U(\mathbf {r} ^{n})} and contained within a box of volume V = L 3 {\displaystyle V=L^{3}} . This system is described by the partition function of the canonical ensemble in 3 dimensions: Z sys ( N , V , T ) = 1 Λ Λ 3 N N !

∫ ∫ 0 L ⋯ ⋯ ∫ ∫ 0 L d r N exp ⁡ ⁡ [ − − β β U ( r N ) ] , {\displaystyle Z^{\text{sys}}(N,V,T)={\frac {1}{\Lambda ^{3N}N!}}\int _{0}^{L}\cdots \int _{0}^{L}d\mathbf {r} ^{N}\exp \left[-\beta U{\left(\mathbf {r} ^{N}\right)}\right],} where Λ Λ = h 2 β β / ( 2 π π m ) {\textstyle \Lambda ={\sqrt {h^{2}\beta /(2\pi m)}}} , the thermal de Broglie wavelength ( β β = 1 / k B T {\displaystyle \beta =1/k_{\text{B}}T} and k B {\displaystyle k_{\text{B}}} is the Boltzmann constant ), and the factor 1 / N !

{\displaystyle 1/N!} (which accounts for indistinguishability of particles) both ensure normalization of entropy in the quasi-classical limit.

[ 2 ] It is convenient to adopt a new set of coordinates defined by L s i = r i {\displaystyle L\mathbf {s} _{i}=\mathbf {r} _{i}} such that the partition function becomes Z sys ( N , V , T ) = V N Λ Λ 3 N N !

∫ ∫ 0 1 ⋯ ⋯ ∫ ∫ 0 1 d s N exp ⁡ ⁡ [ − − β β U ( s N ) ] .

{\displaystyle Z^{\text{sys}}(N,V,T)={\frac {V^{N}}{\Lambda ^{3N}N!}}\int _{0}^{1}\cdots \int _{0}^{1}d\mathbf {s} ^{N}\exp \left[-\beta U{\left(\mathbf {s} ^{N}\right)}\right].} If this system is then brought into contact with a bath of volume V 0 {\displaystyle V_{0}} at constant temperature and pressure containing an ideal gas with total particle number M {\displaystyle M} such that M − − N ≫ ≫ N {\displaystyle M-N\gg N} , the partition function of the whole system is simply the product of the partition functions of the subsystems: Z sys+bath ( N , V , T ) = V N ( V 0 − − V ) M − − N Λ Λ 3 M N !

( M − − N ) !

∫ ∫ d s M − − N ∫ ∫ d s N exp ⁡ ⁡ [ − − β β U ( s N ) ] .

{\displaystyle Z^{\text{sys+bath}}(N,V,T)={\frac {V^{N}(V_{0}-V)^{M-N}}{\Lambda ^{3M}N!(M-N)!}}\int d\mathbf {s} ^{M-N}\int d\mathbf {s} ^{N}\exp \left[-\beta U{\left(\mathbf {s} ^{N}\right)}\right].} The system (volume V {\displaystyle V} ) is immersed in a much larger bath of constant temperature, and closed off such that particle number remains fixed. The system is separated from the bath by a piston that is free to move, such that its volume can change.

The integral over the s M − − N {\displaystyle \mathbf {s} ^{M-N}} coordinates is simply 1 {\displaystyle 1} . In the limit that V 0 → → ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle V_{0}\to \infty } , M → → ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle M\to \infty } while ( M − − N ) / V 0 = ρ ρ {\displaystyle (M-N)/V_{0}=\rho } stays constant, a change in volume of the system under study will not change the pressure p {\displaystyle p} of the whole system. Taking V / V 0 → → 0 {\displaystyle V/V_{0}\to 0} allows for the approximation ( V 0 − − V ) M − − N = V 0 M − − N ( 1 − − V / V 0 ) M − − N ≈ ≈ V 0 M − − N exp ⁡ ⁡ [ − − ( M − − N ) V / V 0 ] {\displaystyle (V_{0}-V)^{M-N}=V_{0}^{M-N}(1-V/V_{0})^{M-N}\approx V_{0}^{M-N}\exp[-(M-N)V/V_{0}]} . For an ideal gas, ( M − − N ) / V 0 = ρ ρ = β β P {\displaystyle (M-N)/V_{0}=\rho =\beta P} gives a relationship between density and pressure. Substituting this into the above expression for the partition function, multiplying by a factor β β P {\displaystyle \beta P} (see below for justification for this step), and integrating over the volume V then gives Δ Δ sys+bath ( N , P , T ) = β β P V 0 M − − N Λ Λ 3 M N !

( M − − N ) !

∫ ∫ d V V N e − − β β P V ∫ ∫ d s N e − − β β U ( s ) .

{\displaystyle \Delta ^{\text{sys+bath}}(N,P,T)={\frac {\beta PV_{0}^{M-N}}{\Lambda ^{3M}N!(M-N)!}}\int dV\,V^{N}e^{-\beta PV}\int d\mathbf {s} ^{N}e^{-\beta U(\mathbf {s} )}.} The partition function for the bath is simply Δ Δ bath = V 0 M − − N / [ ( M − − N ) !

Λ Λ 3 ( M − − N ) {\displaystyle \Delta ^{\text{bath}}=V_{0}^{M-N}/[(M-N)!\Lambda ^{3(M-N)}} . Separating this term out of the overall expression gives the partition function for the N p T {\displaystyle NpT} -ensemble: Δ Δ sys ( N , P , T ) = β β P Λ Λ 3 N N !

∫ ∫ d V V N e − − β β P V ∫ ∫ d s N e − − β β U ( s ) .

{\displaystyle \Delta ^{\text{sys}}(N,P,T)={\frac {\beta P}{\Lambda ^{3N}N!}}\int dV\,V^{N}e^{-\beta PV}\int d\mathbf {s} ^{N}e^{-\beta U(\mathbf {s} )}.} Using the above definition of Z sys ( N , V , T ) {\displaystyle Z^{\text{sys}}(N,V,T)} , the partition function can be rewritten as Δ Δ sys ( N , P , T ) = β β P ∫ ∫ d V e − − β β P V Z sys ( N , V , T ) , {\displaystyle \Delta ^{\text{sys}}(N,P,T)=\beta P\int dV\,e^{-\beta PV}Z^{\text{sys}}(N,V,T),} which can be written more generally as a weighted sum over the partition function for the canonical ensemble Δ Δ ( N , P , T ) = ∫ ∫ Z ( N , V , T ) e − − β β P V C d V .

{\displaystyle \Delta (N,P,T)=\int Z(N,V,T)\,e^{-\beta PV}C\,dV.} The quantity C {\displaystyle C} is simply some constant with units of inverse volume, which is necessary to make the integral dimensionless . In this case, C = β β P {\displaystyle C=\beta P} , but in general it can take on multiple values. The ambiguity in its choice stems from the fact that volume is not a quantity that can be counted (unlike e.g. the number of particles), and so there is no “natural metric” for the final volume integration performed in the above derivation.

[ 2 ] This problem has been addressed in multiple ways by various authors, [ 3 ] [ 4 ] leading to values for C with the same units of inverse volume. The differences vanish (i.e. the choice of C {\displaystyle C} becomes arbitrary) in the thermodynamic limit , where the number of particles goes to infinity.

[ 5 ] The N p T {\displaystyle NpT} -ensemble can also be viewed as a special case of the Gibbs canonical ensemble, in which the macrostates of the system are defined according to external temperature T {\displaystyle T} and external forces acting on the system J {\displaystyle \mathbf {J} } . Consider such a system containing N {\displaystyle N} particles. The Hamiltonian of the system is then given by H − − J ⋅ ⋅ x {\displaystyle {\mathcal {H}}-\mathbf {J} \cdot \mathbf {x} } where H {\displaystyle {\mathcal {H}}} is the system's Hamiltonian in the absence of external forces and x {\displaystyle \mathbf {x} } are the conjugate variables of J {\displaystyle \mathbf {J} } . The microstates μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } of the system then occur with probability defined by [ 6 ] p ( μ μ , x ) = 1 Z exp ⁡ ⁡ [ − − β β H ( μ μ ) + β β J ⋅ ⋅ x ] {\displaystyle p(\mu ,\mathbf {x} )={\frac {1}{\mathcal {Z}}}\exp \left[-\beta {\mathcal {H}}(\mu )+\beta \mathbf {J} \cdot \mathbf {x} \right]} where the normalization factor Z {\displaystyle {\mathcal {Z}}} is defined by Z ( N , J , T ) = ∑ ∑ μ μ , x exp ⁡ ⁡ [ − − β β H ( μ μ ) + β β J ⋅ ⋅ x ] .

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {Z}}(N,\mathbf {J} ,T)=\sum _{\mu ,\mathbf {x} }\exp[-\beta {\mathcal {H}}(\mu )+\beta \mathbf {J} \cdot \mathbf {x} ].} This distribution is called generalized Boltzmann distribution by some authors.

[ 7 ] The N p T {\displaystyle NpT} -ensemble can be found by taking J = − − P {\displaystyle \mathbf {J} =-P} and x = V {\displaystyle \mathbf {x} =V} . Then the normalization factor becomes Z ( N , J , T ) = ∑ ∑ μ μ , { r i } ∈ ∈ V exp ⁡ ⁡ [ − − β β ( P V + p 2 2 m + U ( r N ) ) ] , {\displaystyle {\mathcal {Z}}(N,\mathbf {J} ,T)=\sum _{\mu ,\{\mathbf {r} _{i}\}\in V}\exp \left[-\beta \left(PV+{\frac {\mathbf {p} ^{2}}{2m}}+U{\left(\mathbf {r} ^{N}\right)}\right)\right],} where the Hamiltonian has been written in terms of the particle momenta p i {\displaystyle \mathbf {p} _{i}} and positions r i {\displaystyle \mathbf {r} _{i}} . This sum can be taken to an integral over both V {\displaystyle V} and the microstates μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } . The measure for the latter integral is the standard measure of phase space for identical particles : d Γ Γ N = 1 h 3 N !

∏ ∏ i = 1 N d 3 p i d 3 r i {\displaystyle {\textrm {d}}\Gamma _{N}={\frac {1}{h^{3}N!}}\prod _{i=1}^{N}d^{3}\mathbf {p} _{i}d^{3}\mathbf {r} _{i}} .

[ 6 ] The integral over exp ⁡ ⁡ ( − − β β p 2 / 2 m ) {\displaystyle \exp(-\beta \mathbf {p} ^{2}/2m)} term is a Gaussian integral , and can be evaluated explicitly as ∫ ∫ ∏ ∏ i = 1 N d 3 p i h 3 exp ⁡ ⁡ [ − − β β ∑ ∑ i = 1 N p i 2 2 m ] = 1 Λ Λ 3 N .

{\displaystyle \int \prod _{i=1}^{N}{\frac {d^{3}\mathbf {p} _{i}}{h^{3}}}\exp {\bigg [}-\beta \sum _{i=1}^{N}{\frac {p_{i}^{2}}{2m}}{\bigg ]}={\frac {1}{\Lambda ^{3N}}}.} Inserting this result into Z ( N , P , T ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {Z}}(N,P,T)} gives a familiar expression: [ 6 ] Z ( N , P , T ) = 1 Λ Λ 3 N N !

∫ ∫ d V e − − β β P V ∫ ∫ d r N e − − β β U ( r ) = ∫ ∫ d V e − − β β P V Z ( N , V , T ) .

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\mathcal {Z}}(N,P,T)&={\frac {1}{\Lambda ^{3N}N!}}\int dVe^{-\beta PV}\int d\mathbf {r} ^{N}e^{-\beta U(\mathbf {r} )}\\[1ex]&=\int dV\,e^{-\beta PV}Z(N,V,T).\end{aligned}}} This is almost the partition function for the N p T {\displaystyle NpT} -ensemble, but it has units of volume, an unavoidable consequence of taking the above sum over volumes into an integral. Restoring the constant C {\displaystyle C} yields the proper result for Δ Δ ( N , P , T ) {\displaystyle \Delta (N,P,T)} .

From the preceding analysis it is clear that the characteristic state function of this ensemble is the Gibbs free energy , G ( N , P , T ) = − − k B T ln ⁡ ⁡ Δ Δ ( N , P , T ) {\displaystyle G(N,P,T)=-k_{\text{B}}T\ln \Delta (N,P,T)} This thermodynamic potential is related to the Helmholtz free energy (logarithm of the canonical partition function), F {\displaystyle F\,} , in the following way: [ 1 ] G = F + P V .

{\displaystyle G=F+PV.} Applications [ edit ] Constant-pressure simulations are useful for determining the equation of state of a pure system. Monte Carlo simulations using the N p T {\displaystyle NpT} -ensemble are particularly useful for determining the equation of state of fluids at pressures of around 1 atm, where they can achieve accurate results with much less computational time than other ensembles.

[ 2 ] Zero-pressure N p T {\displaystyle NpT} -ensemble simulations provide a quick way of estimating vapor-liquid coexistence curves in mixed-phase systems.

[ 2 ] N p T {\displaystyle NpT} -ensemble Monte Carlo simulations have been applied to study the excess properties [ 8 ] and equations of state [ 9 ] of various models of fluid mixtures.

The N p T {\displaystyle NpT} -ensemble is also useful in molecular dynamics simulations, e.g. to model the behavior of water at ambient conditions.
