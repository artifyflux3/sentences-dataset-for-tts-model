Doha Newspaper The Daily Northwestern Colors Purple and white [ 6 ] Nickname Wildcats Sporting affiliations NCAA Division I FBS – Big Ten CCFC Mascot Willie the Wildcat Website northwestern.edu Northwestern University ( NU ) is a private research university in Evanston, Illinois , United States. Established in 1851 to serve the historic Northwest Territory , it is the oldest chartered university in Illinois .

Chartered by the Illinois General Assembly in 1851, Northwestern was initially affiliated with the Methodist Episcopal Church but later became non-sectarian . By 1900, the university was the third-largest university in the United States , after Michigan and Harvard . Northwestern became a founding member of the Big Ten Conference in 1896 and joined the Association of American Universities in 1917.

Northwestern is composed of eleven undergraduate, graduate, and professional schools in the fields of management , law , journalism , engineering , medicine , and others. As of 2024, the university had an endowment of $15.6 billion, an annual budget of around $3.3 billion, [ 7 ] [ 8 ] and research funding of over $1 billion.

[ 9 ] The university fields 19 intercollegiate athletic teams, the Northwestern Wildcats , which compete in the NCAA Division I in the Big Ten Conference .

As of September 2020, 33 Nobel Prize laureates and 2 Fields Medalists [ 10 ] were affiliated with Northwestern as alumni or faculty . In addition, Northwestern has been associated with 47 Pulitzer Prize winners, 23 National Medal of Science winners, 11 National Humanities Medal recipients, 23 MacArthur Fellows , 20 Rhodes Scholars , [ 11 ] and 28 Marshall Scholars . Northwestern alumni also include 10 living billionaires, [ 12 ] 2 U.S. Supreme Court Justices , [ 13 ] [ 14 ] and 25 Olympic medalists .

History [ edit ] Main article: History of Northwestern University Founding and early years [ edit ] University Hall (1869), the oldest building still standing on campus The foundation of Northwestern University can be traced to a meeting on May 31, 1850, of nine prominent Chicago businessmen, Methodist leaders, and attorneys who had formed the idea of establishing a university to serve what had been known from 1787 to 1803 as the Northwest Territory . On January 28, 1851, the Illinois General Assembly granted a charter to the Trustees of the North-Western University , making it the first chartered university in Illinois.

[ 15 ] [ 16 ] The school's nine founders, all of whom were Methodists (three of them ministers), knelt in prayer and worship before launching their first organizational meeting.

[ 17 ] Although they affiliated the university with the Methodist Episcopal Church, they favored a non-sectarian admissions policy, believing that Northwestern should serve all people in the newly developing territory by bettering the economy in Evanston .

[ 18 ] John Evans , for whom Evanston is named, bought 379 acres (153 ha) of land along Lake Michigan in 1853, and Philo Judson developed plans for what would become the city of Evanston, Illinois. The first building, Old College , opened on November 5, 1855.

[ 19 ] To raise funds for its construction, Northwestern sold $100 "perpetual scholarships" entitling the purchaser and his heirs to free tuition.

[ 20 ] [ 21 ] Another building, University Hall , was built in 1869 of the same Joliet limestone as the Chicago Water Tower , also built in 1869, one of the few buildings in the heart of Chicago to survive the Great Chicago Fire of 1871.

[ 22 ] In 1873 Evanston College for Ladies merged with Northwestern.

Frances Willard , who later gained fame as a suffragette and as one of the founders of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union , became the school's first dean of women ( Willard Residential College , built in 1938, honors her name). Northwestern admitted its first female students in 1869, and the first woman graduated in 1874.

[ 23 ] Northwestern fielded its first intercollegiate football team in 1882, later becoming a founding member of the Big Ten Conference. In the 1870s and 1880s, Northwestern affiliated itself with already existing schools of law, medicine, and dentistry in Chicago. As the university's enrollments grew, these professional schools were integrated with the undergraduate college in Evanston. The result was a modern research university combining professional, graduate, and undergraduate programs, which gave equal weight to teaching and research.

[ 24 ] [ 25 ] 20th century [ edit ] A postcard of Northwestern University from 1907 By the turn of the century, Northwestern had grown in stature to become the third-largest university in the United States after Harvard University and the University of Michigan .

[ 26 ] Under Walter Dill Scott 's presidency from 1920 to 1939, Northwestern began construction of an integrated campus in Chicago designed by James Gamble Rogers , noted for his Collegiate Gothic architecture, to house the professional schools. In addition, James Gamble Rogers designed a library in accordance with the gothic architectural style on the Evanston campus in order to make use of the $1 million donated to the school after the death of Charles Deering . This library is named in memory of him and its design was inspired by Cambridge University's King's College Chapel . The university also established the Kellogg School of Management and built several prominent buildings on the Evanston campus, including Dyche Stadium , now named Ryan Field , among others. In the 1920s, Northwestern became one of the first six universities in the United States to establish a Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps (NROTC). In 1939, Northwestern hosted the first-ever NCAA Division I men's basketball championship game in the original Patten Gymnasium , which was later demolished and relocated farther north, along with the Dearborn Observatory , to make room for the Technological Institute .

[ citation needed ] A chromolithograph of the school's basketball team , 1910 After the golden years of the 1920s, the Great Depression in the United States (1929–1941) had a severe impact on the university's finances. Its annual income dropped 25 percent from $4.8 million in 1930–31 to $3.6 million in 1933–34. Investment income shrank, fewer people could pay full tuition, and annual giving from alumni and philanthropists fell from $870,000 in 1932 to a low of $331,000 in 1935. The university responded with two salary cuts of 10 percent each for all employees. It imposed hiring and building freezes and slashed appropriations for maintenance, books, and research. Having had a balanced budget in 1930–31, the university now faced deficits of roughly $100,000 for the next four years. Enrollments fell in most schools, with law and music suffering the biggest declines. However, the movement toward state certification of school teachers prompted Northwestern to start a new graduate program in education, thereby bringing in new students and much-needed income. In June 1933, Robert Maynard Hutchins , president of the University of Chicago , proposed a merger of the two universities, estimating annual savings of $1.7 million. The two presidents were enthusiastic, and the faculty liked the idea; many Northwestern alumni, however, opposed it, fearing the loss of their alma mater and its many traditions that distinguished Northwestern from Chicago. The medical school, for example, was oriented toward training practitioners, and alumni feared it would lose its mission if it were merged into the more research-oriented University of Chicago Medical School .

[ 27 ] The merger plan was ultimately dropped. In 1935, the Deering family rescued the university budget with an unrestricted gift of $6 million, bringing the budget up to $5.4 million in 1938–39. This allowed many of the previous spending cuts to be restored, including half of the salary reductions.

[ 28 ] Northwestern's midshipmen school during World War II Like other American universities, Northwestern was transformed by World War II (1939–1945). Regular enrollment fell dramatically, but the school opened high-intensity, short-term programs that trained over 50,000 military personnel, including future president John F. Kennedy . Northwestern's existing NROTC program proved to be a boon to the university as it trained over 36,000 sailors over the course of the war, which led Northwestern to be called the " Annapolis of the Midwest." [ 29 ] Franklyn B. Snyder led the university from 1939 to 1949, and after the war, surging enrollments under the G.I. Bill drove the dramatic expansion of both campuses. In 1948, prominent anthropologist Melville J. Herskovits founded the Program of African Studies at Northwestern, the first center of its kind at an American academic institution.

[ 30 ] J. Roscoe Miller 's tenure as president from 1949 to 1970 saw an expansion of the Evanston campus, with the construction of the Lakefill on Lake Michigan, growth of the faculty and new academic programs, and polarizing Vietnam-era student protests. In 1978, the first and second Unabomber attacks occurred at Northwestern University.

[ 31 ] Relations between Evanston and Northwestern became strained throughout much of the post-war era because of episodes of disruptive student activism, [ 32 ] disputes over municipal zoning, building codes, and law enforcement, [ 33 ] as well as restrictions on the sale of alcohol near campus until 1972.

[ 34 ] [ 35 ] Northwestern's exemption from state and municipal property-tax obligations under its original charter has historically been a source of town-and-gown tension.

[ citation needed ] Although government support for universities declined in the 1970s and 1980s, President Arnold R. Weber was able to stabilize university finances, which led to a revitalization of its campuses. In 1996, Princess Diana visited Northwestern's Evanston and Chicago campuses to raise money for the university hospital's Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center at the invitation of then-President Henry Bienen . Her visit raised a total of $1.5 million for cancer research.

[ 36 ] [ 37 ] [ 38 ] 21st century [ edit ] The Kellogg Global Hub was constructed in 2017.

As admissions to colleges and universities grew increasingly competitive in the 1990s and 2000s, President Bienen 's tenure saw an increase in the number and quality of undergraduate applicants, continued expansion of the facilities and faculty, and renewed athletic competitiveness.

In the 2010s, a five-year capital campaign resulted in a new music center, a replacement building for the business school, and a $270 million athletic complex.

[ 39 ] [ 40 ] In 2014, President Barack Obama delivered a seminal economics speech at the Evanston campus.

[ 41 ] In 2015, Queen Máxima and King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands visited Northwestern to announce research collaborations between Northwestern and several Dutch institutions focused on the study of aging.

[ 42 ] In 2021, an additional $480 million, the largest donation in the university's history, was donated to Northwestern by the Ryan Family to be applied to research at the Kellogg School of Management and Feinberg School of Medicine , as well as for renovating Ryan Field .

[ 43 ] In a partnership with Oakton College and the Illinois Department of Corrections in 2023, Northwestern awarded the first bachelors degrees in the United States to a graduating class of prisoners from a top-ranked university.

[ 44 ] In April 2024, Northwestern University students joined other campuses across the United States in protests against the Gaza war .

[ 45 ] [ 46 ] The student protestors demanded divestment from companies with ties to Israel and that the administration protect freedom of speech , civil rights and be transparent with their investments moving forward.

[ 47 ] The university administration came to an agreement with the protestors  which permitted peaceful demonstrations, gave students representation on an investment committee and pledged to bring Palestinian students to campus.

[ 48 ] In February 2025, Leo Terrell , the head of the Trump administration's Task Force to Combat Antisemitism , announced that he would investigate Northwestern University as part of the Department of Justice's broader investigation into antisemitism on college campuses .

[ citation needed ] Northwestern's Evanston campus, where the undergraduate schools, the Graduate School, and the Kellogg School of Management are located, runs north–south from Lincoln Avenue to Clark Street west of Lake Michigan along Sheridan Road . North Campus is home to the fraternity quads , athletics facilities including the Henry Crown Sports Pavilion and Norris Aquatics Center, the Technological Institute, Dearborn Observatory, the Patrick G. and Shirley W. Ryan Hall for Nanofabrication and Molecular Self-Assembly, and the Ford Motor Company Engineering Design Center among others. South Campus is home to the university's humanities buildings, music buildings like the Pick-Staiger Concert Hall , the Mary and Leigh Block Museum of Art , and the sorority quads. In the 1960s, the university created an additional 84 acres (34 ha) for the campus by filling in a portion of Lake Michigan . Buildings located on the resulting Lakefill include University Library, the Patrick G. and Shirley W. Ryan Center for the Musical Arts, the Regenstein Hall of Music , Norris University Center (the student union), the Kellogg School of Management Global Hub, and various athletics facilities.

[ citation needed ] The Chicago Transit Authority 's elevated train running through Evanston is called the Purple Line , taking its name from Northwestern's school color. The Foster and Davis stations are within walking distance of the southern end of the campus, while the Noyes station is close to the northern end of the campus. The Central station is close to Ryan Field , Northwestern's football stadium. The Evanston Davis Street station serves the Northwestern campus in downtown Evanston and the Evanston Central Street station is near Ryan Field. Pace Suburban Bus Service and the CTA have several bus routes that run through or near the Evanston campus.

Chicago [ edit ] The Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago Northwestern's Chicago campus is located in the city's Streeterville neighborhood near Lake Michigan. The Chicago campus is home to the nationally ranked Northwestern Memorial Hospital , the medical school , the law school , the part-time MBA program, and the School of Professional Studies. Medill's one-year graduate program rents a floor on Wacker Drive, across the river from Streeterville and separate from the rest of the campus. Northwestern's professional schools and a number of its affiliated hospitals are located approximately four blocks east of the Chicago station on the CTA Red Line . The Chicago campus is also served by CTA bus routes.

[ citation needed ] Founded or affiliated at varying points in the university's history, the professional schools originally were scattered throughout Chicago.

[ 50 ] In connection with a 1917 master plan for a central Chicago campus and President Walter Dill Scott 's capital campaign, 8.5 acres (3.44 ha) of land were purchased at the corner of Chicago Avenue and Lake Shore Drive for $1.5 million in 1920.

[ 50 ] [ 51 ] Architect James Gamble Rogers was commissioned to create a master plan for the principal buildings on the new campus, which he designed in collegiate gothic style. In 1923, Mrs. Montgomery Ward donated $8 million to the campaign to finance the construction of the Montgomery Ward Memorial Building, which would house the medical and dental schools, and create endowments for faculty chairs, research grants, scholarships, and building maintenance.

[ 52 ] The building would become the first university skyscraper in the United States.

[ 53 ] In addition to the Ward Building, Rogers designed Wieboldt Hall to house facilities for the School of Commerce [ 54 ] and Levy Mayer Hall to house the School of Law.

[ 55 ] The new campus comprising these three new buildings was dedicated during a two-day ceremony in June 1927. The Chicago campus continued to expand with the addition of Thorne Hall in 1931 and Abbott Hall in 1939.

[ 50 ] [ 56 ] In October 2013, Northwestern began the demolition of the architecturally significant Prentice Women's Hospital . Eric G. Neilson, dean of the medical school, penned an op-ed that equated retaining the building with loss of life.

[ 58 ] Through the Medill School of Journalism and School of Communication, NU-Q offers bachelor's degrees in journalism and communications respectively.

[ 59 ] However, some have questioned whether NU-Q can truly offer a comparable journalism program to that of its U.S. campus given Qatar's instances of censorship and strict limits on journalistic and academic freedoms.

[ 58 ] [ 60 ] The Qatar Foundation for Education, Science and Community Development , a private charitable institution founded by former emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani and his wife and mother of the current emir Sheikha Moza bint Nasser , provided funding for construction and administrative costs, as well as support to hire 50 to 60 faculty and staff, some of whom rotate between the Evanston and Qatar campuses.

[ 61 ] [ 62 ] Northwestern receives roughly $45 million per year to operate the campus.

[ 60 ] In February 2016, Northwestern reached an agreement with the Qatar Foundation to extend the operations of the NU-Q branch for an additional decade, through the 2027–2028 academic year.

[ 63 ] [ 60 ] [ 64 ] [ 65 ] Organization and administration [ edit ] Governance [ edit ] Weber Arch Northwestern is privately owned and governed by an appointed Board of Trustees , which is composed of 70 members and, as of 2022 [update] , is chaired by Peter Barris '74.

[ 66 ] The board delegates its power to an elected president who serves as the chief executive officer of the university.

[ 111 ] The University Library is the 14th-largest university library in North America based on total number of titles held.

Collections and sections [ edit ] Among the library's collection and sections are: Melville J. Herskovits Library of African Studies: established in 1954, and named after Melville J. Herskovits , the Herskovits Library is the largest separate Africana collection in existence. The collection includes more than 400,000 volumes (including 20,000 in African languages), 250 current newspapers and 6,000 non-circulating rare books.

[ 112 ] The Music Library: contains extensive holdings of printed music and archival materials documenting music composed since 1945. The collection includes more than 300,000 items, including the John Cage collection.

Transportation Library: one of the largest transportation information centers in the world with a collection of over 500,000 items covering air, rail, highways, pipeline, water, urban transport and logistics.

The Art Library: the Art Library holds over 160,000 books and journals about art, architecture, and design, with particular strength in 19th-century art and architecture.

Styberg Library: the theological library serves the Garrett–Evangelical Theological Seminary and Bexley Seabury.

Charles Deering McCormick Library of Special Collections include an extensive collection on The Long 60s, Social History, Political History, Literature, Arts, Journalism, Twentieth Century Music, Theatre, Performance, and Women's History.

[ 113 ] The Special Collections department at Charles Deering McCormick Library holds approximately 8,000 items related to the Siege and Commune of Paris during 1870–1871.

This collection is one of the largest and most diverse of its kind in the world and contains a captivating range of original photographs, posters, caricatures, lithographs, manuscripts, books, newspapers, and other artifacts that were created in response to the significant events that occurred during that year. These events included France's defeat in the Franco-Prussian War , the downfall of the Second Empire , the four-month siege of Paris, and the violent civil war that ended the Commune uprising. The core of the collection was acquired in 1971, the centenary year of the Commune's end, when the library's astute staff purchased most of the offerings of a well-known French book dealer. Since then, many other acquisitions have been added to the collection. The Franco-Prussian War was among the earliest conflicts to be photographed, and the collection includes many such images, along with depictions of the devastated Parisian landscape and some of the earliest examples of manipulated photographs created for propaganda purposes.

Northwestern's own religious identity stretches back to its genesis. The University began with a prayer — the school's nine founders (all of them Methodists, three of them ministers) knelt in worship before launching their first organizational meeting. During that meeting, they agreed to establish a university under the patronage of the Methodist Episcopal Church. Throughout most of its history, Northwestern kept a strong Methodist tie. Regional church conferences chose a member of the board of trustees, and until 1890 every University president was an ordained Methodist minister.

^ "Planning a university to serve the Northwest Territory" . Northwestern University. Archived from the original on October 27, 2018 . Retrieved August 15, 2013 .

Although the founders were strong Methodists — three of them were Methodist ministers and before the meeting all those in attendance joined in prayer — they also firmly believed that Northwestern should be an institution that would serve all people. At that time in history, particularly in the Midwest, many religious denominations founded colleges aimed at educating only members of their religion.
