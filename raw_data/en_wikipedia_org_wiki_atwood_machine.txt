The Atwood machine (or Atwood's machine ) was invented in 1784 by the English mathematician George Atwood as a laboratory experiment to verify the mechanical laws of motion with constant acceleration . Atwood's machine is a common classroom demonstration used to illustrate principles of classical mechanics .

The ideal Atwood machine consists of two objects of mass m 1 and m 2 , connected by an inextensible massless string over an ideal massless pulley .

[ 1 ] Both masses experience uniform acceleration. When m 1 = m 2 , the machine is in neutral equilibrium regardless of the position of the weights.

Equation for constant acceleration [ edit ] The free body diagrams of the two hanging masses of the Atwood machine. Our sign convention , depicted by the acceleration vectors is that m 1 accelerates downward and that m 2 accelerates upward, as would be the case if m 1 > m 2 An equation for the acceleration can be derived by analyzing forces.
Assuming a massless, inextensible string and an ideal massless pulley, the only forces to consider are: tension force ( T ), and the weight of the two masses ( W 1 and W 2 ). To find an acceleration, consider the forces affecting each individual mass. 
Using Newton's second law (with a sign convention of m 1 > m 2 {\displaystyle m_{1}>m_{2}} ) derive a system of equations for the acceleration ( a ).

As a sign convention, assume that a is positive when downward for m 1 {\displaystyle m_{1}} and upward for m 2 {\displaystyle m_{2}} . Weight of m 1 {\displaystyle m_{1}} and m 2 {\displaystyle m_{2}} is simply W 1 = m 1 g {\displaystyle W_{1}=m_{1}g} and W 2 = m 2 g {\displaystyle W_{2}=m_{2}g} respectively.

Forces affecting m 1 : m 1 g − − T = m 1 a {\displaystyle m_{1}g-T=m_{1}a} Forces affecting m 2 : T − − m 2 g = m 2 a {\displaystyle T-m_{2}g=m_{2}a} and adding the two previous equations yields m 1 g − − m 2 g = m 1 a + m 2 a , {\displaystyle m_{1}g-m_{2}g=m_{1}a+m_{2}a,} and the concluding formula for acceleration a = g m 1 − − m 2 m 1 + m 2 {\displaystyle a=g{\frac {m_{1}-m_{2}}{m_{1}+m_{2}}}} The Atwood machine is sometimes used to illustrate the Lagrangian method of deriving equations of motion.
