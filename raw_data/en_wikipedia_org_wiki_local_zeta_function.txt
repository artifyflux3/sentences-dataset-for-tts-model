[ 1 ] Making the variable transformation t = q − s , gives Z ( V , t ) = exp ⁡ ⁡ ( ∑ ∑ k = 1 ∞ ∞ N k t k k ) {\displaystyle {\mathit {Z}}(V,t)=\exp \left(\sum _{k=1}^{\infty }N_{k}{\frac {t^{k}}{k}}\right)} as the formal power series in the variable t {\displaystyle t} .

Equivalently, the local zeta function is sometimes defined as follows: ( 1 ) Z ( V , 0 ) = 1 {\displaystyle (1)\ \ {\mathit {Z}}(V,0)=1\,} ( 2 ) d d t log ⁡ ⁡ Z ( V , t ) = ∑ ∑ k = 1 ∞ ∞ N k t k − − 1 .

{\displaystyle (2)\ \ {\frac {d}{dt}}\log {\mathit {Z}}(V,t)=\sum _{k=1}^{\infty }N_{k}t^{k-1}\ .} In other words, the local zeta function Z ( V , t ) with coefficients in the finite field F q is defined as a function whose logarithmic derivative generates the number N k of solutions of the equation defining V in the degree k extension F q k .

Formulation [ edit ] Given a finite field F , there is, up to isomorphism , only one field F k with [ F k : F ] = k {\displaystyle [F_{k}:F]=k\,} , for k = 1, 2, ... .  When F is the unique field with q elements, F k is the unique field with q k {\displaystyle q^{k}} elements.   Given a set of polynomial equations — or an algebraic variety V — defined over F , we can count the number N k {\displaystyle N_{k}\,} of solutions in F k and create the generating function G ( t ) = N 1 t + N 2 t 2 / 2 + N 3 t 3 / 3 + ⋯ ⋯ {\displaystyle G(t)=N_{1}t+N_{2}t^{2}/2+N_{3}t^{3}/3+\cdots \,} .

The correct definition for Z ( t ) is to set log Z equal to G ,  so Z = exp ⁡ ⁡ ( G ( t ) ) {\displaystyle Z=\exp(G(t))\,} and Z (0) = 1, since G (0) = 0, and Z ( t ) is a priori a formal power series .

The logarithmic derivative Z ′ ( t ) / Z ( t ) {\displaystyle Z'(t)/Z(t)\,} equals the generating function G ′ ( t ) = N 1 + N 2 t 1 + N 3 t 2 + ⋯ ⋯ {\displaystyle G'(t)=N_{1}+N_{2}t^{1}+N_{3}t^{2}+\cdots \,} .

Examples [ edit ] For example, assume all the N k are 1; this happens for example if we start with an equation like X = 0, so that geometrically we are taking V to be a point. Then G ( t ) = − − log ⁡ ⁡ ( 1 − − t ) {\displaystyle G(t)=-\log(1-t)} is the expansion of a logarithm (for | t | < 1). In this case we have Z ( t ) = 1 ( 1 − − t ) .

{\displaystyle Z(t)={\frac {1}{(1-t)}}\ .} To take something more interesting, let V be the projective line over F . If F has q elements, then this has q + 1 points, including the one point at infinity . Therefore, we have N k = q k + 1 {\displaystyle N_{k}=q^{k}+1} and G ( t ) = − − log ⁡ ⁡ ( 1 − − t ) − − log ⁡ ⁡ ( 1 − − q t ) {\displaystyle G(t)=-\log(1-t)-\log(1-qt)} for | t | small enough, and therefore Z ( t ) = 1 ( 1 − − t ) ( 1 − − q t ) .

{\displaystyle Z(t)={\frac {1}{(1-t)(1-qt)}}\ .} The first study of these functions was in the 1923 dissertation of Emil Artin . He obtained results for the case of a hyperelliptic curve , and conjectured the further main points of the theory as applied to curves. The theory was then developed by F. K. Schmidt and Helmut Hasse .

[ 2 ] The earliest known nontrivial cases of local zeta functions were implicit in Carl Friedrich Gauss 's Disquisitiones Arithmeticae , article 358. There, certain particular examples of elliptic curves over finite fields having complex multiplication have their points counted by means of cyclotomy .

[ 3 ] For the definition and some examples, see also.

[ 4 ] Motivations [ edit ] The relationship between the definitions of G and Z can be explained in a number of ways. (See for example the infinite product formula for Z below.) In practice it makes Z a rational function of t , something that is interesting even in the case of V an elliptic curve over a finite field.

The local Z zeta functions are multiplied to get global ζ ζ {\displaystyle \zeta } zeta functions, ζ ζ = ∏ ∏ Z {\displaystyle \zeta =\prod Z} These generally involve different finite fields (for example the whole family of fields Z / p Z as p runs over all prime numbers ).

In these fields,  the variable t is substituted by p −s , where s is the complex variable traditionally used in Dirichlet series . (For details see Hasse–Weil zeta function .) The global products of Z in the two cases used as examples in the previous section therefore come out as ζ ζ ( s ) {\displaystyle \zeta (s)} and ζ ζ ( s ) ζ ζ ( s − − 1 ) {\displaystyle \zeta (s)\zeta (s-1)} after letting q = p {\displaystyle q=p} .

Riemann hypothesis for curves over finite fields [ edit ] For projective curves C over F that are non-singular , it can be shown that Z ( t ) = P ( t ) ( 1 − − t ) ( 1 − − q t ) , {\displaystyle Z(t)={\frac {P(t)}{(1-t)(1-qt)}}\ ,} with P ( t ) a polynomial, of degree 2 g , where g is the genus of C . Rewriting P ( t ) = ∏ ∏ i = 1 2 g ( 1 − − ω ω i t ) , {\displaystyle P(t)=\prod _{i=1}^{2g}(1-\omega _{i}t)\ ,} the Riemann hypothesis for curves over finite fields states | ω ω i | = q 1 / 2 .

{\displaystyle |\omega _{i}|=q^{1/2}\ .} For example, for the elliptic curve case there are two roots, and it is easy to show the absolute values of the roots are q 1/2 .

Hasse's theorem is that they have the same absolute value; and this has immediate consequences for the number of points.

André Weil proved this for the general case, around 1940 ( Comptes Rendus note, April 1940): he spent much time in the years after that writing up the algebraic geometry involved. This led him to the general Weil conjectures .

Alexander Grothendieck developed scheme theory for the purpose of resolving these.
A generation later Pierre Deligne completed the proof. 
(See étale cohomology for the basic formulae of the general theory.) General formulas for the zeta function [ edit ] It is a consequence of the Lefschetz trace formula for the Frobenius morphism that Z ( X , t ) = ∏ ∏ i = 0 2 dim ⁡ ⁡ X det ( 1 − − t Frob q | H c i ( X ¯ ¯ , Q ℓ ℓ ) ) ( − − 1 ) i + 1 .

{\displaystyle Z(X,t)=\prod _{i=0}^{2\dim X}\det {\big (}1-t{\mbox{Frob}}_{q}|H_{c}^{i}({\overline {X}},{\mathbb {Q} }_{\ell }){\big )}^{(-1)^{i+1}}.} Here X {\displaystyle X} is a separated scheme of finite type over the finite field F with q {\displaystyle q} elements, and Frob q is the geometric Frobenius acting on ℓ ℓ {\displaystyle \ell } -adic étale cohomology with compact supports of X ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle {\overline {X}}} , the lift of X {\displaystyle X} to the algebraic closure of the field F .  This shows that the zeta function is a rational function of t {\displaystyle t} .

An infinite product formula for Z ( X , t ) {\displaystyle Z(X,t)} is Z ( X , t ) = ∏ ∏ ( 1 − − t deg ⁡ ⁡ ( x ) ) − − 1 .

{\displaystyle Z(X,t)=\prod \ (1-t^{\deg(x)})^{-1}.} Here, the product ranges over all closed points x of X and deg( x ) is the degree of x .
The local zeta function Z(X, t) is viewed as a function of the complex variable s via the change of 
variables q −s .

In the case where X is the variety V discussed above, the closed points 
are the equivalence classes x=[P] of points P on V ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle {\overline {V}}} , where two points are equivalent if they are conjugates over F .  The degree of x is the degree of the field extension of F generated by the coordinates of P .  The logarithmic derivative of the infinite product Z(X, t) is easily seen to be the generating function discussed above, namely N 1 + N 2 t 1 + N 3 t 2 + ⋯ ⋯ {\displaystyle N_{1}+N_{2}t^{1}+N_{3}t^{2}+\cdots \,} .
