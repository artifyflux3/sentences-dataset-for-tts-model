**Franck Pourcel** (14 August 1913 – 12 November 2000)[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franck_Pourcel#cite_note-Conduct-1) was a [French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_people "French people")[composer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composer "Composer"), [arranger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arranger "Arranger"), and [conductor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conducting "Conducting") of [popular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_music "Popular music") and [classical music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_music "Classical music").

Born in [Marseille](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marseille "Marseille"), France,[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franck_Pourcel#cite_note-Conduct-1) Pourcel started learning the violin at the age of six. Later, Pourcel studied violin at the Conservatoire in Marseille, and also drums because he loved [jazz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz "Jazz"), and he spent a year in [Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris "Paris") at the Conservatoire.

By 1931, he was working as a violinist in several theaters in Marseille, marrying Odette eight years later. He then became the musical director for [Lucienne Boyer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucienne_Boyer "Lucienne Boyer"), with whom he went on a world tour.

He immigrated to the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States") in 1952 but returned to France the following year to record "Blue Tango" and the follow-up "Limelight". In 1954, Pourcel recorded his first [album](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Album "Album") on the Pathé-Marconi [record label](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_label "Record label"), with whom he would record a total of nine albums in a three-year period. In 1956, he recorded his [version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_version "Cover version") of [The Platters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Platters "The Platters") hit "[Only You](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Only_You_(And_You_Alone) "Only You (And You Alone)")", which sold over three million copies by 1959, and was awarded a [gold disc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_recording_sales_certification "Music recording sales certification").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franck_Pourcel#cite_note-The_Book_of_Golden_Discs-2) It peaked at number 9 on the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States")_[Billboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard\_(magazine) "Billboard (magazine)")_[pop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100 "Billboard Hot 100")[chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart "Record chart") during a 16 weeks chart run.

Between 1956 and 1972, he was the conductor for France at the [Eurovision Song Contest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest "Eurovision Song Contest"), with the exceptions of 1957 and 1968. Four of the songs that he conducted won first place for France. As a result, France became the most successful country in the contest's early years, until Luxembourg matched its four wins in 1973.

By 1958, Pourcel started [recording](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction "Sound recording and reproduction")[classical music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_music "Classical music"). His series of _Pages Célèbres_ led him to conduct the [London Symphony Orchestra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Symphony_Orchestra "London Symphony Orchestra"), The Society of Concerts for the Conservatoire, The BBC Orchestra at the [Royal Festival Hall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Festival_Hall "Royal Festival Hall"), and the [Lamoureux Orchestra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamoureux_Orchestra "Lamoureux Orchestra") at the Salle Pleyel in Paris. In 1961, he co-composed with [Paul Mauriat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Mauriat "Paul Mauriat") the [hit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_record "Hit record") "Chariot", which was recorded by [Petula Clark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petula_Clark "Petula Clark") and followed up by [Peggy March](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peggy_March "Peggy March") as "[I Will Follow Him](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Will_Follow_Him "I Will Follow Him")". The song became the main theme for the [film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film "Film"), _[Sister Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sister\_Act "Sister Act")_.

In 1975, at the request of [Air France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_France "Air France"), Pourcel composed an anthem for their new supersonic plane, [Concorde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concorde "Concorde").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franck_Pourcel#cite_note-3)

Pourcel recorded 250 albums, and over 3000 songs, and he conducted famous orchestras such as the [London Symphonic Orchestra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Symphonic_Orchestra "London Symphonic Orchestra"), [BBC Orchestra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Orchestra "BBC Orchestra") and [Orchestre des concerts Lamoureux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchestre_des_concerts_Lamoureux "Orchestre des concerts Lamoureux"). He created the series _Amour Danse et violons_ (54 albums) and the classical series _Pages Célébres_. His first recordings from 1956 to 1962 were released under the series _Originals_.

Pourcel recorded until 1995 with [EMI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMI "EMI").

He died on 12 November 2000 in [Neuilly-sur-Seine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuilly-sur-Seine "Neuilly-sur-Seine"), at the age of 87, from [Parkinson's disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_disease "Parkinson's disease").
