Romanians also consider several other events as preludes to the Great Union, such as the unification of Moldavia and Wallachia (also known as the Little Union, Mica Unire ) in 1859 or the independence of the country and the annexation of Northern Dobruja in 1878, and also the occupation of Transylvania and Moldavia by the Prince of Wallachia , Michael the Brave , in 1600.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Today, the Great Union has an important meaning in Romania , and it is commemorated in the Great Union Day , the national day of the country, every 1 December.

[ 4 ] The centenary of the Great Union on 1 December 2018 was widely celebrated in Romania, with military parades at cities like Alba Iulia or Bucharest to which many people (up to 550,000, 100,000 of them in Alba Iulia alone), including the President of Romania Klaus Iohannis , attended.

[ 5 ] The centenary was also celebrated in Moldova , where more than 100 localities and 3 districts declared unification with Romania .
