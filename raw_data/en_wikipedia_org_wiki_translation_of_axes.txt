This means that the origin O' of the new coordinate system has coordinates ( h , k ) in the original system.  The positive x' and y' directions are taken to be the same as the positive x and y directions.  A point P has coordinates ( x , y ) with respect to the original system and coordinates ( x' , y' ) with respect to the new system, where x = x ′ + h {\displaystyle x=x'+h} and y = y ′ + k {\displaystyle y=y'+k} 1 or equivalently x ′ = x − − h {\displaystyle x'=x-h} and y ′ = y − − k .

{\displaystyle y'=y-k.} [ 1 ] [ 2 ] 2 In the new coordinate system, the point P will appear to have been translated in the opposite direction.  For example, if the xy -system is translated a distance h to the right and a distance k upward, then P will appear to have been translated a distance h to the left and a distance k downward in the x'y' -system .  A translation of axes in more than two dimensions is defined similarly.

[ 3 ] A translation of axes is a rigid transformation , but not a linear map . (See Affine transformation .) Motivation [ edit ] Coordinate systems are essential for studying the equations of curves using the methods of analytic geometry .  To use the method of coordinate geometry, the axes are placed at a convenient position with respect to the curve under consideration.  For example, to study the equations of ellipses and hyperbolas , the foci are usually located on one of the axes and are situated symmetrically with respect to the origin.  If the curve (hyperbola, parabola , ellipse, etc.) is not situated conveniently with respect to the axes, the coordinate system should be changed to place the curve at a convenient and familiar location and orientation.  The process of making this change is called a transformation of coordinates .

[ 4 ] The solutions to many problems can be simplified by translating the coordinate axes to obtain new axes parallel to the original ones.

[ 5 ] Translation of conic sections [ edit ] Main article: Conic section Through a change of coordinates, the equation of a conic section can be put into a standard form , which is usually easier to work with. For the most general equation of the second degree, which takes the form A x 2 + B x y + C y 2 + D x + E y + F = 0 {\displaystyle Ax^{2}+Bxy+Cy^{2}+Dx+Ey+F=0} ( A {\displaystyle A} , B {\displaystyle B} and C {\displaystyle C} not all zero); 3 it is always possible to perform a rotation of axes in such a way that in the new system the equation takes the form A x 2 + C y 2 + D x + E y + F = 0 {\displaystyle Ax^{2}+Cy^{2}+Dx+Ey+F=0} ( A {\displaystyle A} and C {\displaystyle C} not both zero); 4 that is, eliminating the xy term.

[ 6 ] Next, a translation of axes can reduce an equation of the form ( 3 ) to an equation of the same form but with new variables ( x' , y' ) as coordinates, and with D and E both equal to zero (with certain exceptions—for example, parabolas).  The principal tool in this process is "completing the square." [ 7 ] In the examples that follow, it is assumed that a rotation of axes has already been performed.

Example 1 [ edit ] Given the equation 9 x 2 + 25 y 2 + 18 x − − 100 y − − 116 = 0 , {\displaystyle 9x^{2}+25y^{2}+18x-100y-116=0,} by using a translation of axes, determine whether the locus of the equation is a parabola, ellipse, or hyperbola.  Determine foci (or focus), vertices (or vertex), and eccentricity .

Solution: To complete the square in x and y , write the equation in the form 9 ( x 2 + 2 x ) + 25 ( y 2 − − 4 y ) = 116.

{\displaystyle 9(x^{2}+2x)+25(y^{2}-4y)=116.} Complete the squares and obtain 9 ( x 2 + 2 x + 1 ) + 25 ( y 2 − − 4 y + 4 ) = 116 + 9 + 100 {\displaystyle 9(x^{2}+2x+1)+25(y^{2}-4y+4)=116+9+100} ⇔ ⇔ 9 ( x + 1 ) 2 + 25 ( y − − 2 ) 2 = 225.

{\displaystyle \Leftrightarrow 9(x+1)^{2}+25(y-2)^{2}=225.} Define x ′ = x + 1 {\displaystyle x'=x+1} and y ′ = y − − 2.

{\displaystyle y'=y-2.} That is, the translation in equations ( 2 ) is made with h = − − 1 , k = 2.

{\displaystyle h=-1,k=2.} The equation in the new coordinate system is 9 x ′ 2 + 25 y ′ 2 = 225.

{\displaystyle 9x'^{2}+25y'^{2}=225.} 5 Divide equation ( 5 ) by 225 to obtain x ′ 2 25 + y ′ 2 9 = 1 , {\displaystyle {\frac {x'^{2}}{25}}+{\frac {y'^{2}}{9}}=1,} which is recognizable as an ellipse with a = 5 , b = 3 , c 2 = a 2 − − b 2 = 16 , c = 4 , e = 4 5 .

{\displaystyle a=5,b=3,c^{2}=a^{2}-b^{2}=16,c=4,e={\tfrac {4}{5}}.} In the x'y' -system, we have:  center ( 0 , 0 ) {\displaystyle (0,0)} ; vertices ( ± ± 5 , 0 ) {\displaystyle (\pm 5,0)} ; foci ( ± ± 4 , 0 ) .

{\displaystyle (\pm 4,0).} In the xy -system, use the relations x = x ′ − − 1 , y = y ′ + 2 {\displaystyle x=x'-1,y=y'+2} to obtain:  center ( − − 1 , 2 ) {\displaystyle (-1,2)} ; vertices ( 4 , 2 ) , ( − − 6 , 2 ) {\displaystyle (4,2),(-6,2)} ; foci ( 3 , 2 ) , ( − − 5 , 2 ) {\displaystyle (3,2),(-5,2)} ; eccentricity 4 5 .

{\displaystyle {\tfrac {4}{5}}.} [ 8 ] Generalization to several dimensions [ edit ] For an xyz -Cartesian coordinate system in three dimensions, suppose that a second Cartesian coordinate system is introduced, with axes x' , y' and z' so located that the x' axis is parallel to the x axis and h units from it, the y' axis is parallel to the y axis and k units from it, and the z' axis is parallel to the z axis and l units from it.  A point P in space will have coordinates in both systems.  If its coordinates are ( x , y , z ) in the original system and ( x' , y' , z' ) in the second system, the equations x ′ = x − − h , y ′ = y − − k , z ′ = z − − l {\displaystyle x'=x-h,\qquad y'=y-k,\qquad z'=z-l} 6 hold.

[ 9 ] Equations ( 6 ) define a translation of axes in three dimensions where ( h , k , l ) are the xyz -coordinates of the new origin.

[ 10 ] A translation of axes in any finite number of dimensions is defined similarly.

Translation of quadric surfaces [ edit ] Main article: Quadric surface In three-space, the most general equation of the second degree in x , y and z has the form A x 2 + B y 2 + C z 2 + D x y + E x z + F y z + G x + H y + I z + J = 0 , {\displaystyle Ax^{2}+By^{2}+Cz^{2}+Dxy+Exz+Fyz+Gx+Hy+Iz+J=0,} 7 where the quantities A , B , C , … … , J {\displaystyle A,B,C,\ldots ,J} are positive or negative numbers or zero.  The points in space satisfying such an equation all lie on a surface .  Any second-degree equation which does not reduce to a cylinder, plane, line, or point corresponds to a surface which is called quadric.

[ 11 ] As in the case of plane analytic geometry, the method of translation of axes may be used to simplify second-degree equations, thereby making evident the nature of certain quadric surfaces.  The principal tool in this process is "completing the square." [ 12 ] Example 2 [ edit ] Use a translation of coordinates to identify the quadric surface x 2 + 4 y 2 + 3 z 2 + 2 x − − 8 y + 9 z = 10.

{\displaystyle x^{2}+4y^{2}+3z^{2}+2x-8y+9z=10.} Solution: Write the equation in the form x 2 + 2 x + 4 ( y 2 − − 2 y ) + 3 ( z 2 + 3 z ) = 10.

{\displaystyle x^{2}+2x\qquad +4(y^{2}-2y)+3(z^{2}+3z)=10.} Complete the square to obtain ( x + 1 ) 2 + 4 ( y − − 1 ) 2 + 3 ( z + 3 2 ) 2 = 10 + 1 + 4 + 27 4 .

{\displaystyle (x+1)^{2}+4(y-1)^{2}+3(z+{\tfrac {3}{2}})^{2}=10+1+4+{\tfrac {27}{4}}.} Introduce the translation of coordinates x ′ = x + 1 , y ′ = y − − 1 , z ′ = z + 3 2 .

{\displaystyle x'=x+1,\qquad y'=y-1,\qquad z'=z+{\tfrac {3}{2}}.} The equation of the surface takes the form x ′ 2 + 4 y ′ 2 + 3 z ′ 2 = 87 4 , {\displaystyle x'^{2}+4y'^{2}+3z'^{2}={\tfrac {87}{4}},} which is recognizable as the equation of an ellipsoid .
