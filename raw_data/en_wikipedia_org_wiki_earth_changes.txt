This includes "natural events" (such as major earthquakes , the melting of the polar ice caps , a pole shift of the planetary axis, major weather events , solar flares and so on [ 1 ] ) as well as huge changes of the local and global social, economical and political systems.

Cayce's term was taken up in certain segments of the New Age movement, [ 2 ] often associated with other predictions by people claiming to have psychic abilities.

[ 3 ] These beliefs have occasionally been associated with Christian millennialism and beliefs about UFOs.

[ 1 ] Some New Age adherents believe that Earth changes will preface a "Golden Age" of spirituality and world peace .

[ 4 ] [ 2 ] Prophecies of Edgar Cayce [ edit ] In the 1930s and 1940s, Cayce made many prophecies of cataclysmic events involving the whole planet, [ 4 ] with a series of "earth changes" occurring between 1958 and 1998.

[ 5 ] He predicted that the polar axis would shift and that many areas that are now land would again become ocean floor, and that Atlantis would rise from the sea.

[ 5 ] Prophecies of others [ edit ] A representation of the location of the five "Golden Cities" envisioned by Toye, in a flooded United States In the late 1980s, Lori Toye published the I Am America Map , based on several visions that she claimed to have beginning in 1983.

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] The I Am America Map sold over 40,000 copies, and was followed by subsequent maps: Freedom Star World map, Golden Cities map, and an Earth Changes Progression series of maps.  These maps represented the earth's future geography after climatic earth changes.

[ 8 ] In 2004, self-proclaimed psychic Gordon-Michael Scallion issued a variety of prophecies centering on the concept of "Earth Changes". He publishes a monthly newsletter, The Earth Changes Report .

[ 9 ] Reception and interpretation [ edit ] Prophecies of Earth changes have been described as a form of pseudoscience, in which terminology and ideas borrowed from science are used to rationalize non-scriptural apocalyptical thought based on visionary experiences.

[ 3 ] David Spangler , a leader of the Findhorn Foundation spiritual community, described prophecies of Earth changes as an expression of collective fear and anger, rather than as foretelling of actual future events.
