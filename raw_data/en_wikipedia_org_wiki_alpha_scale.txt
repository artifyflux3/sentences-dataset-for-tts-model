It is derived from approximating just intervals using multiples of a single interval, but without requiring (as temperaments normally do) an octave (2:1). It may be approximated by dividing the perfect fifth (3:2) into nine equal steps, with frequency ratio ( 3 2 ) 1 9 , {\displaystyle \ \left({\tfrac {\ 3\ }{2}}\right)^{\tfrac {1}{9}}\ ,} [ 1 ] or by dividing the minor third (6:5) into four frequency ratio steps of ( 6 5 ) 1 4 .

{\displaystyle \ \left({\tfrac {\ 6\ }{5}}\right)^{\tfrac {1}{4}}~.} [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] The size of this scale step may also be precisely derived from using 9:5 ( B ♭ , 1017.60 cents, Play ⓘ ) to approximate the interval ⁠ 3:2 / 5:4 ⁠ = 6:5 ( E ♭ , 315.64 cents, Play ⓘ ) .

[ 4 ] Carlos' α (alpha) scale arises from ... taking a value for the scale degree so that nine of them approximate a 3:2 perfect fifth, five of them approximate a 5:4 major third, and four of them approximate a 6:5 minor third. In order to make the approximation as good as possible we minimize the mean square deviation .

[ 4 ] The formula below finds the minimum by setting the derivative of the mean square deviation with respect to the scale step size to 0 .

9 log 2 ⁡ ⁡ ( 3 2 ) + 5 log 2 ⁡ ⁡ ( 5 4 ) + 4 log 2 ⁡ ⁡ ( 6 5 ) 9 2 + 5 2 + 4 2 ≈ ≈ 0.06497082462 {\displaystyle \ {\frac {\ 9\ \log _{2}\left({\frac {\ 3\ }{2}}\right)+5\log _{2}\left({\frac {\ 5\ }{4}}\right)+4\ \log _{2}\left({\frac {\ 6\ }{5}}\right)\ }{\ 9^{2}+5^{2}+4^{2}\ }}\approx 0.06497082462\ } and 0.06497082462 × × 1200 = 77.964989544 {\displaystyle \ 0.06497082462\times 1200=77.964989544\ } ( Play ⓘ ) At 78 cents per step, this totals approximately 15.385 steps per octave , however, more accurately, the alpha scale step is 77.965 cents and there are 15.3915 steps per octave.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] Though it does not have a perfect octave , the alpha scale produces "wonderful triads ," ( Play major ⓘ and minor triad ⓘ ) and the beta scale has similar properties but the sevenths are more in tune.

[ 2 ] However, the alpha scale has "excellent harmonic seventh chords ... using the [octave] inversion of ⁠ 7 / 4 ⁠ , i.e., ⁠ 8 / 7 ⁠ [ Play ⓘ ]."

This actually differs very slightly from Carlos' figure of 15.385 α -scale degrees to the octave. This is obtained by approximating the scale degree to 78.0 cents.
