The definition is more complicated and technical than the one for complex manifolds due in part to the noncommutativity of the quaternions and in part to the lack of a suitable calculus of holomorphic functions for quaternions. The most succinct definition uses the language of G -structures on a manifold . Specifically, a quaternionic n- manifold can be defined as a smooth manifold of real dimension 4 n equipped with a torsion-free GL ⁡ ⁡ ( n , H ) ⋅ ⋅ H × × {\displaystyle \operatorname {GL} (n,\mathbb {H} )\cdot \mathbb {H} ^{\times }} -structure. More naïve, but straightforward, definitions lead to a dearth of examples, and exclude spaces like quaternionic projective space which should clearly be considered as quaternionic manifolds.

Early history [ edit ] Marcel Berger's 1955 paper [ 1 ] on the classification of Riemannian holonomy groups first raised the issue of the existence of non-symmetric manifolds with holonomy Sp( n )·Sp(1).Interesting results were proved in the mid-1960s in pioneering work by Edmond Bonan [ 2 ] and Kraines [ 3 ] who have independently proven that any such manifold admits a parallel 4-form Ω Ω {\displaystyle \Omega } .The long-awaited analog of strong Lefschetz theorem was published [ 4 ] in 1982 : Ω Ω n − − k ∧ ∧ ⋀ ⋀ 2 k T ∗ ∗ M = ⋀ ⋀ 4 n − − 2 k T ∗ ∗ M .

{\displaystyle \Omega ^{n-k}\wedge \bigwedge ^{2k}T^{*}M=\bigwedge ^{4n-2k}T^{*}M.} Definitions [ edit ] The enhanced quaternionic general linear group [ edit ] If we regard the quaternionic vector space H n ≅ ≅ R 4 n {\displaystyle \mathbb {H} ^{n}\cong \mathbb {R} ^{4n}} as a right H {\displaystyle \mathbb {H} } -module , we can identify the algebra of right H {\displaystyle \mathbb {H} } -linear maps with the algebra of n × × n {\displaystyle n\times n} quaternionic matrices acting on H n {\displaystyle \mathbb {H} ^{n}} from the left . The invertible right H {\displaystyle \mathbb {H} } -linear maps then form a subgroup GL ⁡ ⁡ ( n , H ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {GL} (n,\mathbb {H} )} of GL ⁡ ⁡ ( 4 n , R ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {GL} (4n,\mathbb {R} )} . We can enhance this group with the group H × × {\displaystyle \mathbb {H} ^{\times }} of nonzero quaternions acting by scalar multiplication on H n {\displaystyle \mathbb {H} ^{n}} from the right . Since this scalar multiplication is R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } -linear (but not H {\displaystyle \mathbb {H} } -linear) we have another embedding of H × × {\displaystyle \mathbb {H} ^{\times }} into GL ⁡ ⁡ ( 4 n , R ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {GL} (4n,\mathbb {R} )} . The group GL ⁡ ⁡ ( n , H ) ⋅ ⋅ H × × {\displaystyle \operatorname {GL} (n,\mathbb {H} )\cdot \mathbb {H} ^{\times }} is then defined as the product of these subgroups in GL ⁡ ⁡ ( 4 n , R ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {GL} (4n,\mathbb {R} )} . Since the intersection of the subgroups GL ⁡ ⁡ ( n , H ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {GL} (n,\mathbb {H} )} and H × × {\displaystyle \mathbb {H} ^{\times }} in GL ⁡ ⁡ ( 4 n , R ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {GL} (4n,\mathbb {R} )} is their mutual center R × × {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{\times }} (the group of scalar matrices with nonzero real coefficients), we have the isomorphism GL ⁡ ⁡ ( n , H ) ⋅ ⋅ H × × ≅ ≅ ( GL ⁡ ⁡ ( n , H ) × × H × × ) / R × × .

{\displaystyle \operatorname {GL} (n,\mathbb {H} )\cdot \mathbb {H} ^{\times }\cong (\operatorname {GL} (n,\mathbb {H} )\times \mathbb {H} ^{\times })/\mathbb {R} ^{\times }.} Almost quaternionic structure [ edit ] An almost quaternionic structure on a smooth manifold M {\displaystyle M} is just a GL ⁡ ⁡ ( n , H ) ⋅ ⋅ H × × {\displaystyle \operatorname {GL} (n,\mathbb {H} )\cdot \mathbb {H} ^{\times }} -structure on M {\displaystyle M} . Equivalently, it can be defined as a subbundle H {\displaystyle H} of the endomorphism bundle End ⁡ ⁡ ( T M ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {End} (TM)} such that each fiber H x {\displaystyle H_{x}} is isomorphic (as a real algebra ) to the quaternion algebra H {\displaystyle \mathbb {H} } . The subbundle H {\displaystyle H} is called the almost quaternionic structure bundle . A manifold equipped with an almost quaternionic structure is called an almost quaternionic manifold .

The quaternion structure bundle H {\displaystyle H} naturally admits a bundle metric coming from the quaternionic algebra structure, and, with this metric, H {\displaystyle H} splits into an orthogonal direct sum of vector bundles H = L ⊕ ⊕ E {\displaystyle H=L\oplus E} where L {\displaystyle L} is the trivial line bundle through the identity operator, and E {\displaystyle E} is a rank-3 vector bundle corresponding to the purely imaginary quaternions. Neither the bundles H {\displaystyle H} or E {\displaystyle E} are necessarily trivial.

The unit sphere bundle Z = S ( E ) {\displaystyle Z=S(E)} inside E {\displaystyle E} corresponds to the pure unit imaginary quaternions. These are endomorphisms of the tangent spaces that square to −1. The bundle Z {\displaystyle Z} is called the twistor space of the manifold M {\displaystyle M} , and its properties are described in more detail below.

Local sections of Z {\displaystyle Z} are (locally defined) almost complex structures . There exists a neighborhood U {\displaystyle U} of every point x {\displaystyle x} in an almost quaternionic manifold M {\displaystyle M} with an entire 2-sphere of almost complex structures defined on U {\displaystyle U} . One can always find I , J , K ∈ ∈ Γ Γ ( Z | U ) {\displaystyle I,J,K\in \Gamma (Z|_{U})} such that I 2 = J 2 = K 2 = I J K = − − 1 {\displaystyle I^{2}=J^{2}=K^{2}=IJK=-1} Note, however, that none of these operators may be extendable to all of M {\displaystyle M} . That is, the bundle Z {\displaystyle Z} may admit no global sections (e.g. this is the case with quaternionic projective space H P n {\displaystyle \mathbb {HP} ^{n}} ). This is in marked contrast to the situation for complex manifolds, which always have a globally defined almost complex structure.

Quaternionic structure [ edit ] A quaternionic structure on a smooth manifold M {\displaystyle M} is an almost quaternionic structure Q {\displaystyle Q} which admits a torsion-free affine connection ∇ ∇ {\displaystyle \nabla } preserving Q {\displaystyle Q} . Such a connection is never unique, and is not considered to be part of the quaternionic structure.  A quaternionic manifold is a smooth manifold M {\displaystyle M} together with a quaternionic structure on M {\displaystyle M} .

Special cases and additional structures [ edit ] Hypercomplex manifolds [ edit ] A hypercomplex manifold is a quaternionic manifold with a torsion-free GL ⁡ ⁡ ( n , H ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {GL} (n,\mathbb {H} )} -structure. The reduction of the structure group to GL ⁡ ⁡ ( n , H ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {GL} (n,\mathbb {H} )} is possible if and only if the almost quaternionic structure bundle H ⊂ ⊂ End ⁡ ⁡ ( T M ) {\displaystyle H\subset \operatorname {End} (TM)} is trivial (i.e. isomorphic to M × × H {\displaystyle M\times \mathbb {H} } ). An almost hypercomplex structure corresponds to a global frame of H {\displaystyle H} , or, equivalently, triple of almost complex structures I , J {\displaystyle I,J} , and K {\displaystyle K} such that I 2 = J 2 = K 2 = I J K = − − 1 {\displaystyle I^{2}=J^{2}=K^{2}=IJK=-1} A hypercomplex structure is an almost hypercomplex structure such that each of I , J {\displaystyle I,J} , and K {\displaystyle K} are integrable.

Quaternionic Kähler manifolds [ edit ] A quaternionic Kähler manifold is a quaternionic manifold with a torsion-free Sp ⁡ ⁡ ( n ) ⋅ ⋅ Sp ⁡ ⁡ ( 1 ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Sp} (n)\cdot \operatorname {Sp} (1)} -structure.

Hyperkähler manifolds [ edit ] A hyperkähler manifold is a quaternionic manifold with a torsion-free Sp ⁡ ⁡ ( n ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Sp} (n)} -structure. A hyperkähler manifold is simultaneously a hypercomplex manifold and a quaternionic Kähler manifold.

Twistor space [ edit ] Given a quaternionic n {\displaystyle n} -manifold M {\displaystyle M} , the unit 2-sphere subbundle Z = S ( E ) {\displaystyle Z=S(E)} corresponding to the pure unit imaginary quaternions (or almost complex structures) is called the twistor space of M {\displaystyle M} . It turns out that, when n ≥ ≥ 2 {\displaystyle n\geq 2} , there exists a natural complex structure on Z {\displaystyle Z} such that the fibers of the projection Z → → M {\displaystyle Z\to M} are isomorphic to C P 1 {\displaystyle \mathbb {CP} ^{1}} . When n = 1 {\displaystyle n=1} , the space Z {\displaystyle Z} admits a natural almost complex structure , but this structure is integrable only if the manifold is self-dual . It turns out that the quaternionic geometry on M {\displaystyle M} can be reconstructed entirely from holomorphic data on Z {\displaystyle Z} .

The twistor space theory gives a method of translating problems on quaternionic manifolds into problems on complex manifolds, which are much better understood, and amenable to methods from algebraic geometry . Unfortunately, the twistor space of a quaternionic manifold can be quite complicated, even for simple spaces like H n {\displaystyle \mathbb {H} ^{n}} .
