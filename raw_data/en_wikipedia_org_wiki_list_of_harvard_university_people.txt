Vibrant, playful, semi-abstract landscapes. Mr. Hatton, who lives in New York, layers broad, richly colored shapes of trees, rivers and hills into funky, tautly frontal arcadian visions. His paintings seem a mix of Fauvism, Abstract Expressionism and outsider vision.

The New York Sun . Archived from the original on December 4, 2010 . Retrieved January 1, 2010 .

The abstracted landscapes in Julian Hatton's seventh show at Elizabeth Harris are less "real" in terms of factual description, but they contain their own peculiar truths, evident in keenly felt colors and designs. His 14 paintings reflect an aesthetic – often underappreciated today – seeking the veracity of rhythmic form. One could say Mr. Hatton updates Matisse's updating of Giotto, in that he looks to formal relationships, stripped of academic conventions, to make a deeper semblance.
