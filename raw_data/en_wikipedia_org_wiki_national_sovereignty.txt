A **nation state**, or **nation-state**, is a political entity in which the [state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(polity) "State (polity)") (a centralized political organization ruling over a population within a territory) and the [nation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation "Nation") (a community based on a common identity) are (broadly or ideally) congruent.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-4) "Nation state" is a more precise concept than "[country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country "Country")" or "state", since a country or a state does not need to have a predominant national or [ethnic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group "Ethnic group") group.

A [nation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation "Nation"), sometimes used in the sense of a common [ethnicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnicity "Ethnicity"), may include a [diaspora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaspora "Diaspora") or [refugees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee "Refugee") who live outside the nation-state; some dispersed nations (such as the [Roma nation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_people "Romani people"), for example) do not have a state where that ethnicity predominates. In a more general sense, a nation-state is simply a large, politically sovereign country or administrative territory. A nation-state may be contrasted with:

*   An [empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire "Empire"), a political unit made up of several territories and peoples, typically established through conquest and marked by a dominant center and subordinate peripheries.
*   A [multinational state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinational_state "Multinational state"), where no one ethnic or cultural group dominates (such a state may also be considered a [multicultural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicultural "Multicultural") state - depending on the degree of [cultural assimilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_assimilation "Cultural assimilation") of its various groups).
*   A [city-state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City-state "City-state"), which is both smaller than a "nation" in the sense of a "large sovereign country" and which may or may not be dominated by all or part of a single "nation" in the sense of a common ethnicity or culture.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-Radan2002-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-Boll2007-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-Elazar1998-7)
*   A [confederation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederation "Confederation"), a league of sovereign states, which might or might not include nation-states.
*   A [federated state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federated_state "Federated state"), which may or may not be a nation-state, and which is only partially self-governing within a larger [federation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation "Federation") (for example, the state boundaries of [Bosnia and Herzegovina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosnia_and_Herzegovina "Bosnia and Herzegovina") are drawn along ethnic lines, but those of the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States") are not).

This article mainly discusses the more specific definition of a nation-state as a typically sovereign country dominated by a particular ethnicity.

The relationship between a nation (in the ethnic sense) and a state can be complex. The presence of a state can encourage [ethnogenesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnogenesis "Ethnogenesis"), and a group with a pre-existing ethnic identity can influence the drawing of territorial boundaries or argue for [political legitimacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legitimacy_(political) "Legitimacy (political)"). This definition of a "nation-state" is not universally accepted. "All attempts to develop terminological consensus around 'nation' failed", concludes academic [Valery Tishkov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valery_Tishkov "Valery Tishkov").[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-8)[Walker Connor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walker_Connor "Walker Connor") discusses the impressions surrounding the characters of "[nation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation "Nation")", "[(sovereign) state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state "Sovereign state")", "nation-state", and "[nationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism "Nationalism")". Connor, who gave the term "[ethnonationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnonationalism "Ethnonationalism")" wide currency, also discusses the tendency to confuse nation and state and the treatment of all states as if nation states.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-9)

Painting of "The Ratification of the [Treaty of Münster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_of_M%C3%BCnster "Peace of Münster")"; this and other negotiations resulted in the 1648 [Peace of Westphalia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_of_Westphalia "Peace of Westphalia")

The origins and early history of nation-states are disputed. A major theoretical question is: "Which came first, the nation or the nation-state?" Scholars such as [Steven Weber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Weber_(professor) "Steven Weber (professor)"), [David Woodward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Woodward_(cartographer) "David Woodward (cartographer)"), [Michel Foucault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Foucault "Michel Foucault"), and [Jeremy Black](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Black_(historian) "Jeremy Black (historian)")[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-10)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-11)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-12) have advanced the hypothesis that the nation-state did not arise out of political ingenuity or an unknown undetermined source, nor was it a political invention; rather, it is an inadvertent by-product of 15th-century intellectual discoveries in [political economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_economy "Political economy"), [capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism "Capitalism"), [mercantilism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercantilism "Mercantilism"), [political geography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_geography "Political geography"), and [geography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography "Geography")[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-13)[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-14) combined with [cartography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartography "Cartography")[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-15)[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-16) and [advances in map-making technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartography#Technological_changes "Cartography").[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-17)[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-18) It was with these intellectual discoveries and technological advances that the nation-state arose.

For others, the nation existed first. Then nationalist movements arose for [sovereignty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty "Sovereignty"), and the nation-state was created to meet that demand. Some "[modernization theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modernization_theory "Modernization theory")" of nationalism see it as a product of government policies to unify and modernize an already existing state. Most theories see the nation-state as a 19th-century European phenomenon facilitated by developments such as state-mandated education, mass [literacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literacy "Literacy"), and [mass media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media "Mass media"). However, historians[_[who?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual\_of\_Style/Words\_to\_watch#Unsupported\_attributions "Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch")_] also note the early emergence of a relatively unified state and identity in [Portugal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal "Portugal") and the [Dutch Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Republic "Dutch Republic"),[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-19) and some date the emergence of nations even earlier. [Adrian Hastings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Hastings "Adrian Hastings"), for instance, argued that [Ancient Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Israel "Ancient Israel") as depicted in the [Hebrew Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_Bible "Hebrew Bible") "gave the world the model of nationhood, and even nation-statehood"; however, after the [fall of Jerusalem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Jerusalem_(70_CE) "Siege of Jerusalem (70 CE)"), the Jews lost this status for nearly two millennia, while still preserving their national identity until "the more inevitable rise of [Zionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism "Zionism")", in modern times, which sought to establish a [nation-state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Israel "State of Israel").[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-20)

[Eric Hobsbawm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Hobsbawm "Eric Hobsbawm") argues that the establishment of a [French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_people "French people") nation was not the result of [French nationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_nationalism "French nationalism"), which would not emerge until the end of the 19th century, but rather the policies implemented by pre-existing French states. Many of these reforms were implemented since the [French Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution "French Revolution"), at which time only half of the French people spoke some French– with only a quarter of those speaking the version of it found in literature and places of learning.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-hobsbawm1-21) As the number of [Italian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_language "Italian language") speakers in Italy was even lower at the time of [Italian unification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_unification "Italian unification"), similar arguments have been made regarding the modern [Italian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italians "Italians") nation, with both the French and the Italian states promoting the replacement of various regional dialects and languages with [standardized dialects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_language "Standard language"). The introduction of [conscription](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription "Conscription") and the [Third Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Third_Republic "French Third Republic")'s [1880s laws on public instruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_Ferry_laws "Jules Ferry laws") facilitated the creation of a national identity under this theory.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-22)

[![Image 2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Europe_1848_map_en.png/330px-Europe_1848_map_en.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Europe_1848_map_en.png)

The [Revolutions of 1848](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutions_of_1848 "Revolutions of 1848") were democratic and liberal, intending to remove the old [monarchical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy "Monarchy") structures and to create independent nation-states.

Some nation-states, such as [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany "Germany") and [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy "Italy"), came into existence at least partly as a result of political campaigns by [nationalists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism "Nationalism") during the 19th century. In both cases the territory was previously divided among other states, some very small. At first, the sense of common identity was a cultural movement, such as in the [_Völkisch_ movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C3%B6lkisch_movement "Völkisch movement") in German-speaking states, which rapidly acquired a political significance. In these cases the nationalist sentiment and the nationalist movement precede the unification of the German and Italian nation-states.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

Historians Hans Kohn, Liah Greenfeld, Philip White, and others have classified nations such as Germany or Italy, where they believe cultural unification preceded state unification, as _ethnic nations_ or _ethnic nationalities_. However, "state-driven" national unifications, such as in France, England, or China, are more likely to flourish in multiethnic societies, producing a traditional national heritage of _civic nations_ or _territory-based nationalities_.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-23)[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-24)[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-ref1-25)

The idea of a nation-state was and is associated with the rise of the modern system of states, often called the "[Westphalian system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westphalian_system "Westphalian system")", following the [Treaty of Westphalia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_of_Westphalia "Peace of Westphalia") (1648). The [balance of power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_of_power_in_international_relations "Balance of power in international relations"), which characterized that system, depended for its effectiveness upon clearly defined, centrally controlled, independent entities, whether [empires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire "Empire") or nation states, which recognize each other's sovereignty and territory. The Westphalian system did not create the nation-state, but the nation-state meets the criteria for its component states (by assuming that there is no disputed territory).[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] Before the Westphalian system, the closest geopolitical system was the "Chanyuan system" established in East Asia in 1005 through the [Treaty of Chanyuan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chanyuan_Treaty "Chanyuan Treaty"), which, like the Westphalian peace treaties, designated national borders between the independent regimes of China's [Song dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song_dynasty "Song dynasty") and the semi-nomadic [Liao dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liao_dynasty "Liao dynasty").[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-26) This system was copied and developed in East Asia in the following centuries until the establishment of the pan-Eurasian [Mongol Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_Empire "Mongol Empire") in the 13th century.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-27)

The nation-state received a philosophical underpinning in the era of [Romanticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanticism "Romanticism"), at first as the "natural" expression of the individual peoples ([romantic nationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romantic_nationalism "Romantic nationalism"): see [Johann Gottlieb Fichte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Gottlieb_Fichte "Johann Gottlieb Fichte")'s conception of the _[Volk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People "People")_, later opposed by [Ernest Renan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Renan "Ernest Renan")). The increasing emphasis during the 19th century on the ethnic and racial origins of the nation led to a redefinition of the nation-state in these terms.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-ref1-25)[Racism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism "Racism"), which in [Boulainvilliers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_de_Boulainvilliers "Henri de Boulainvilliers")'s theories was inherently anti[patriotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriotism "Patriotism") and antinationalist, joined itself with [colonialist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonialism "Colonialism") imperialism and "continental [imperialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperialism "Imperialism")", most notably in [pan-Germanic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan-Germanic "Pan-Germanic") and [pan-Slavic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan-Slavic "Pan-Slavic") movements.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-28)

The relationship between racism and ethnic nationalism reached its height in the 20th century through [fascism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism "Fascism") and [Nazism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism "Nazism"). The specific combination of "nation" ("people") and "state" expressed in such terms as the _völkischer Staat_ and implemented in laws such as the 1935 [Nuremberg laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_laws "Nuremberg laws") made fascist states such as early [Nazi Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany "Nazi Germany") qualitatively different from non-fascist nation-states. [Minorities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minorities "Minorities") were not considered part of the people (_Volk_) and were consequently denied to have an authentic or legitimate role in such a state. In Germany, neither [Jews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews "Jews") nor the [Roma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_people "Romani people") were considered part of the people, and both were specifically targeted for persecution. German [nationality law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationality_law "Nationality law") defined "German" based on German ancestry, excluding _all_ non-Germans from the people.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-29)

In recent years, a nation-state's claim to absolute [sovereignty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty "Sovereignty") within its borders has been criticized.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-ref1-25) A global political system based on [international agreements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law "International law") and supra-national blocs characterized the post-war era. Non-state actors, such as international [corporations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation "Corporation") and [non-governmental organizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organizations "Non-governmental organizations"), are widely seen as eroding the economic and political power of nation-states.

According to Andreas Wimmer and Yuval Feinstein, nation-states tended to emerge when power shifts allowed nationalists to overthrow existing regimes or absorb existing administrative units.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-30) Xue Li and Alexander Hicks link the frequency of nation-state creation to processes of diffusion that emanate from international organizations.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-31)

### Before the nation-state

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nation_state&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Before the nation-state")]

[![Image 3](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Dissolution_of_Austria-Hungary.png/500px-Dissolution_of_Austria-Hungary.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Dissolution_of_Austria-Hungary.png)

Dissolution of the multiethnic [Austro-Hungarian Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austro-Hungarian_Empire "Austro-Hungarian Empire") (1918)

In [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe "Europe"), during the 18th century, the classic non-national states were the _multiethnic_[empires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire "Empire"), the [Austrian Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_Empire "Austrian Empire"), the [Kingdom of France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_France "Kingdom of France") (and its [empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_colonial_empire "French colonial empire")), the [Kingdom of Hungary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Hungary "Kingdom of Hungary"),[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-32) the [Russian Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Empire "Russian Empire"), the [Portuguese Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_Empire "Portuguese Empire"), the [Spanish Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Empire "Spanish Empire"), the [Ottoman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire "Ottoman Empire"), the [British Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire "British Empire"), the [Dutch Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Empire "Dutch Empire") and smaller nations at what would now be called sub-state level. The multi-ethnic empire was a monarchy, usually [absolute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_monarchy "Absolute monarchy"), ruled by a king, [emperor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor "Emperor") or [sultan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sultan "Sultan").[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-33) The population belonged to many ethnic groups, and they spoke many languages. The empire was dominated by one ethnic group, and their language was usually the language of public administration. The ruling [dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynasty "Dynasty") was usually, but not always, from that group.

This type of state is not specifically European: such empires existed in Asia, Africa and the Americas. Chinese dynasties, such as the [Tang dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tang_dynasty "Tang dynasty"), the [Yuan dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuan_dynasty "Yuan dynasty"), and the [Qing dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qing_dynasty "Qing dynasty"), were all multiethnic regimes governed by a ruling ethnic group. In the three examples, their ruling ethnic groups were the [Han-Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Chinese "Han Chinese"), [Mongols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongolian_people "Mongolian people"), and the [Manchus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchu_people "Manchu people"). In the [Muslim world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_world "Muslim world"), immediately after Muhammad died in 632, [Caliphates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caliphate "Caliphate") were established.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-34) Caliphates were [Islamic states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_state "Islamic state") under the leadership of a political-religious successor to the Islamic prophet [Muhammad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad "Muhammad").[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-khalifate-35) These [polities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polities "Polities") developed into multi-ethnic trans-national empires.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-36) The Ottoman sultan, [Selim I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selim_I "Selim I") (1512–1520) reclaimed the title of caliph, which had been in dispute and asserted by a diversity of rulers and "shadow caliphs" in the centuries of the [Abbasid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbasid "Abbasid")-[Mamluk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamluk "Mamluk") Caliphate since the [Mongols' sacking of Baghdad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Baghdad_(1258) "Siege of Baghdad (1258)") and the killing of the [last Abbasid Caliph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Musta%27sim "Al-Musta'sim") in Baghdad, Iraq 1258. The [Ottoman Caliphate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Caliphate "Ottoman Caliphate") as an office of the [Ottoman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire "Ottoman Empire") was abolished under [Mustafa Kemal Atatürk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustafa_Kemal_Atat%C3%BCrk "Mustafa Kemal Atatürk") in 1924 as part of [Atatürk's Reforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atat%C3%BCrk%27s_Reforms "Atatürk's Reforms").

[![Image 4](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/Holy_Roman_Empire_at_the_Golden_Bull_of_1356.png/250px-Holy_Roman_Empire_at_the_Golden_Bull_of_1356.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Holy_Roman_Empire_at_the_Golden_Bull_of_1356.png)

The [Holy Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire "Holy Roman Empire") was a limited elective monarchy composed of hundreds of [state-like entities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_states_in_the_Holy_Roman_Empire "List of states in the Holy Roman Empire").

Some of the smaller European states were not so ethnically diverse but were also [dynastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynasty "Dynasty") states ruled by a [royal house](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynasty "Dynasty"). Their territory could expand by [royal intermarriage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_intermarriage "Royal intermarriage") or merge with another state when the dynasty merged. In some parts of Europe, notably [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany "Germany"), minimal territorial units existed. They were recognized by their neighbours as independent and had their government and laws. Some were ruled by [princes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince "Prince") or other hereditary rulers; some were governed by [bishops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop "Bishop") or [abbots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbot "Abbot"). Because they were so small, however, they had no separate language or culture: the inhabitants shared the language of the surrounding region.

In some cases, these states were overthrown by nationalist uprisings in the 19th century. Liberal ideas of [free trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_trade "Free trade") played a role in German unification, which was preceded by a [customs union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs_union "Customs union"), the [Zollverein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zollverein "Zollverein"). However, the [Austro-Prussian War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austro-Prussian_War "Austro-Prussian War") and the German alliances in the [Franco-Prussian War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco-Prussian_War "Franco-Prussian War") were decisive in the unification. The [Austro-Hungarian Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austro-Hungarian_Empire "Austro-Hungarian Empire") and the [Ottoman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire "Ottoman Empire") broke up after the [First World War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World_War "First World War"), but the [Russian Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Empire "Russian Empire") was replaced by the [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union") in most of its multinational territory after the [Russian Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War "Russian Civil War").

A few of the smaller states survived: the independent principalities of [Liechtenstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liechtenstein "Liechtenstein"), [Andorra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andorra "Andorra"), [Monaco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaco "Monaco"), and the Republic of [San Marino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Marino "San Marino"). ([Vatican City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vatican_City "Vatican City") is a special case. All of the larger [Papal States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal_State "Papal State") save the Vatican itself were occupied and absorbed by Italy by 1870. The resulting [Roman Question](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Question "Roman Question") was resolved with the rise of the modern state under the 1929 [Lateran treaties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateran_treaties "Lateran treaties") between [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy "Italy") and the [Holy See](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_See "Holy See").)

Changes in national boundaries after the dissolutions of the [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissolution_of_the_Soviet_Union "Dissolution of the Soviet Union") and [Czechoslovakia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissolution_of_Czechoslovakia "Dissolution of Czechoslovakia"), the [breakup of Yugoslavia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_Yugoslavia "Breakup of Yugoslavia") and the [reunification of Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reunification_of_Germany "Reunification of Germany")

"Legitimate states that govern effectively and dynamic industrial economies are widely regarded today [2004] as the defining characteristics of a modern nation-state."[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-37)

Nation-states have their characteristics differing from pre-national states. For a start, they have a different attitude to their territory compared to dynastic monarchies: it is semisacred and nontransferable. No nation would swap territory with other states simply, for example, because the king's daughter married. They have a different type of [border](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border "Border"), in principle, defined only by the national group's settlement area. However, many nation-states also sought natural borders (rivers, mountain ranges). They are constantly changing in population size and power because of the limited restrictions of their borders.

The most noticeable characteristic is the degree to which nation-states use the state as an instrument of national unity in economic, social and cultural life.

The nation-state promoted economic unity by abolishing internal [customs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs "Customs") and [tolls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toll_road "Toll road"). In Germany, that process, the creation of the [Zollverein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zollverein "Zollverein"), preceded formal national unity. Nation states typically have a policy to create and maintain national transportation infrastructure, facilitating trade and travel. In 19th-century Europe, the expansion of the [rail transport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_transport "Rail transport") networks was at first largely a matter for [private](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_enterprise "Private enterprise") railway companies but gradually came under the control of the national governments. The French rail network, with its main lines radiating from Paris to all corners of France, is often seen as a reflection of the centralised French nation-state, which [directed its construction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_rail_transport_in_France "History of rail transport in France"). Nation states continue to build, for instance, specifically national [motorway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorway "Motorway") networks. Specifically, transnational infrastructure programmes, such as the [Trans-European Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-European_Networks "Trans-European Networks"), are a recent innovation.

The nation-states typically had a more centralised and uniform [public administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_administration "Public administration") than their imperial predecessors: they were smaller, and the population was less diverse. (The internal diversity of the [Ottoman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire "Ottoman Empire"), for instance, was very great.) After the 19th-century triumph of the nation-state in Europe, regional identity was subordinate to national identity in regions such as [Alsace-Lorraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alsace-Lorraine "Alsace-Lorraine"), [Catalonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalonia "Catalonia"), [Brittany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittany "Brittany") and [Corsica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corsica "Corsica"). In many cases, the regional administration was also subordinated to the central (national) government. This process was partially reversed from the 1970s onward, with the introduction of various forms of [regional autonomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_autonomy "Regional autonomy"), in formerly [centralised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centralised_government "Centralised government") states such as [Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain "Spain") or [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy "Italy").

The most apparent impact of the nation-state, as compared to its non-national predecessors, is creating a uniform national [culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture "Culture") through state policy. The model of the nation-state implies that its population constitutes a [nation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation "Nation"), united by a common descent, a common language and many forms of shared culture. When implied unity was absent, the nation-state often tried to create it. It promoted a uniform national language through [language policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_policy "Language policy"). The creation of national systems of compulsory [primary education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education "Primary education") and a relatively uniform [curriculum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curriculum "Curriculum") in secondary schools was the most effective instrument in the spread of the [national languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_language "National language"). The schools also taught national history, often in a [propagandistic and mythologised version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historiography_and_nationalism "Historiography and nationalism"), and (especially during conflicts) some nation-states still teach this kind of history.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-38)[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-39)[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-40)[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-41)[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-42)

Language and cultural policy was sometimes hostile, aimed at suppressing non-national elements. Language [prohibitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition "Prohibition") were sometimes used to accelerate the adoption of national languages and the decline of [minority languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_language "Minority language") (see examples: [Anglicisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglicisation "Anglicisation"), [Bulgarization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgarization "Bulgarization"), [Croatization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatization "Croatization"), [Czechization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czechization "Czechization"), [Dutchification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutchification "Dutchification"), [Francisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisation "Francisation"), [Germanisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanisation "Germanisation"), [Hellenization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenization "Hellenization"), [Hispanicization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanicization "Hispanicization"), [Italianization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italianization "Italianization"), [Lithuanization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanization "Lithuanization"), [Magyarisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magyarisation "Magyarisation"), [Polonisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polonisation "Polonisation"), [Russification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russification "Russification"), [Serbization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbization "Serbization"), [Slovakisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovakisation "Slovakisation"), [Swedification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedification "Swedification"), [Turkification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkification "Turkification")).

In some cases, these policies triggered bitter conflicts and further ethnic [separatism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separatism "Separatism"). But where it worked, the cultural uniformity and homogeneity of the population increased. Conversely, the cultural divergence at the border became sharper: in theory, a uniform French identity extends from the Atlantic coast to the [Rhine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhine "Rhine"), and on the other bank of the Rhine, a uniform German identity begins. Both sides have divergent [language policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_policy "Language policy") and educational systems to enforce that model.

[![Image 6](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/Map_Europe_1923-en.svg/330px-Map_Europe_1923-en.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Map_Europe_1923-en.svg)

Map of [territorial changes in Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_border_changes_(1914%E2%80%93present) "List of national border changes (1914–present)") after [World War I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I "World War I") (as of 1923)

The notion of a unifying "national identity" also extends to countries that host multiple ethnic or language groups, such as [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India "India"). For example, [Switzerland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland "Switzerland") is constitutionally a confederation of [cantons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantons_of_Switzerland "Cantons of Switzerland") and has four official languages. Still, it also has a "Swiss" national identity, a national history and a classic national hero, [Wilhelm Tell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Tell "Wilhelm Tell").[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-43)

Innumerable conflicts have arisen where political boundaries did not correspond with ethnic or cultural boundaries.

After World War II in the [Josip Broz Tito](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josip_Broz_Tito "Josip Broz Tito") era, nationalism was appealed to for uniting [South Slav](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Slav "South Slav") peoples. Later in the 20th century, after the break-up of the Soviet Union, leaders appealed to ancient ethnic feuds or tensions that ignited conflict between the [Serbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbs "Serbs"), [Croats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croats "Croats"), and [Slovenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenes "Slovenes"), as well as [Bosniaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosniaks "Bosniaks"), [Montenegrins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montenegrins_(ethnic_group) "Montenegrins (ethnic group)") and [Macedonians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedonians_(ethnic_group) "Macedonians (ethnic group)"), eventually breaking up the long collaboration of peoples. Ethnic cleansing was carried out in the Balkans, destroying the formerly [socialist republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_state "Socialist state") and producing the civil wars in [Croatia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatian_War_of_Independence "Croatian War of Independence") and [Bosnia and Herzegovina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosnian_War "Bosnian War") in 1992–95, resulting in mass population displacements and segregation that radically altered what was once a highly diverse and intermixed ethnic makeup of the region. These conflicts were mainly about creating a new political framework of states, each of which would be ethnically and politically homogeneous. Serbs, Croats and Bosniaks insisted they were ethnically distinct, although many communities had a long history of intermarriage.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

[Belgium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium "Belgium") is a classic example of a state that is not a nation-state.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] The state was formed by [secession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secession "Secession") from the [United Kingdom of the Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_the_Netherlands "United Kingdom of the Netherlands") in 1830, whose neutrality and integrity was protected by the [Treaty of London 1839](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_London_1839 "Treaty of London 1839"); thus, it served as a [buffer state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_state "Buffer state") after the Napoleonic Wars between the European powers [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France "France"), [Prussia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prussia "Prussia") (after 1871 the [German Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Empire "German Empire")) and the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom "United Kingdom") until [World War I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I "World War I"), when the Germans breached its neutrality. Currently, Belgium is divided between the [Flemings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flemings "Flemings") in the north, the [French-speaking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French-speaking "French-speaking") population in the south, and the German-speaking population in the east. The [Flemish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flanders "Flanders") population in the north speaks Dutch, the [Walloon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallonia "Wallonia") population in the south speaks either [French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language "French language") or, in the east of [Liège Province](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li%C3%A8ge_Province "Liège Province"), German. The Brussels population speaks French or Dutch.

The Flemish identity is also cultural, and there is a strong separatist movement espoused by the political parties, the right-wing [Vlaams Belang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vlaams_Belang "Vlaams Belang") and the [New Flemish Alliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Flemish_Alliance "New Flemish Alliance"). The Francophone [Walloon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallonia "Wallonia") identity of Belgium is linguistically distinct and [regionalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regionalism_(politics) "Regionalism (politics)"). There is also unitary [Belgian nationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_nationalism "Belgian nationalism"), several versions of a [Greater Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Netherlands "Greater Netherlands") ideal, and a [German-speaking community of Belgium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German-speaking_community_of_Belgium "German-speaking community of Belgium") annexed from [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany "Germany") in 1920 and re-annexed by Germany in 1940–1944. However, these ideologies are all very marginal and politically insignificant during elections.

[China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China "China") covers a large geographic area and uses the concept of "[Zhonghua minzu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhonghua_minzu "Zhonghua minzu")" or Chinese nationality, in the sense of [ethnic groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group "Ethnic group"). Still, it also officially recognizes the majority [Han](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Chinese "Han Chinese") ethnic group which accounts for over 90% of the population, and no fewer than 55 [ethnic national minorities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_minorities_in_China "Ethnic minorities in China").

According to Philip G. Roeder, [Moldova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moldova "Moldova") is an example of a Soviet-era "segment-state" ([Moldavian SSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moldavian_SSR "Moldavian SSR")), where the "nation-state project of the segment-state trumped the nation-state project of prior statehood. In Moldova, despite strong agitation from university faculty and students for reunification with [Romania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania "Romania"), the nation-state project forged within the Moldavian SSR trumped the project for a return to the interwar nation-state project of [Greater Romania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Romania "Greater Romania")."[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-Roeder2007-45) See [Controversy over linguistic and ethnic identity in Moldova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy_over_linguistic_and_ethnic_identity_in_Moldova "Controversy over linguistic and ethnic identity in Moldova") for further details.

[Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel "Israel") was founded as a [Jewish state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_state "Jewish state") in 1948. Its [Basic Laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Laws_of_Israel "Basic Laws of Israel") describe it as both a Jewish and a democratic state. The [Basic Law: Israel as the Nation-State of the Jewish People](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Law:_Israel_as_the_Nation-State_of_the_Jewish_People "Basic Law: Israel as the Nation-State of the Jewish People") (2018) explicitly specifies the nature of the [State of Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Israel "State of Israel") as the [nation-state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation-state "Nation-state") of the [Jewish people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews "Jews").[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-46)[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-47) According to the [Israel Central Bureau of Statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Central_Bureau_of_Statistics "Israel Central Bureau of Statistics"), 75.7% of Israel's population are Jews.[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-48)[Arabs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_citizens_of_Israel "Arab citizens of Israel"), who make up 20.4% of the population, are the largest ethnic minority in Israel. Israel also has very small communities of [Armenians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenians_in_Israel "Armenians in Israel"), [Circassians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circassians_in_Israel "Circassians in Israel"), [Assyrians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assyrians_in_Israel "Assyrians in Israel"), [Samaritans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samaritans "Samaritans").[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-49) There are also some non-Jewish spouses of Israeli Jews. However, these communities are very small, and usually number only in the hundreds or thousands.[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-50)

### Kingdom of the Netherlands

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nation_state&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Kingdom of the Netherlands")]

The [Kingdom of the Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_the_Netherlands "Kingdom of the Netherlands") presents an unusual example in which one kingdom represents four distinct countries. The four countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands are:[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-51)

*   [Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands "Netherlands") (including the [provinces in continental Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_the_Netherlands "Provinces of the Netherlands") and the [special municipalities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean_Netherlands "Caribbean Netherlands") of [Bonaire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonaire "Bonaire"), [Sint Eustatius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sint_Eustatius "Sint Eustatius") and [Saba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saba_(island) "Saba (island)"))
*   [Aruba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aruba "Aruba")
*   [Curaçao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cura%C3%A7ao "Curaçao")
*   [Sint Maarten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sint_Maarten "Sint Maarten")

Each is expressly designated as a _land_ in [Dutch law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_Netherlands "Law of the Netherlands") by the [Charter for the Kingdom of the Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter_for_the_Kingdom_of_the_Netherlands "Charter for the Kingdom of the Netherlands").[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-52) Unlike the German _Länder_ and the Austrian _Bundesländer_, _landen_ is consistently translated as "countries" by the Dutch government.[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-53)[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-SMN-54)[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-Newstatus-55)

Iberian monarchies and kingdoms in 1400

While historical monarchies often brought together different kingdoms/territories/ethnic groups under the same crown, in modern nation states political elites seek a uniformity of the population, leading to state nationalism.[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-56)[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-57) In the case of the Christian territories of the future [Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain "Spain"), neighboring [Al-Andalus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Andalus "Al-Andalus"), there was an early perception of ethnicity, faith and shared territory in the Middle Ages (13th–14th centuries), as documented by the [Chronicle of Muntaner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronicle_of_Muntaner "Chronicle of Muntaner") in the proposal of the [Castilian king](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Toledo_(Crown_of_Castile) "Kingdom of Toledo (Crown of Castile)") to the other Christian kings of the peninsula: "if these four Kings of Spain whom he named, who are of one flesh and blood, held together, little need they fear all the other powers of the world".[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-58)[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-59)[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-60) After the dynastic union of the [Catholic Monarchs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Monarchs_of_Spain "Catholic Monarchs of Spain") in the 15th century, the Spanish Monarchy ruled over different kingdoms, each with its own cultural, linguistic and political particularities, and the kings had to swear by the [Laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws "Laws") of each territory before the respective [Parliaments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament "Parliament"). Forming the [Spanish Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Empire "Spanish Empire"), at this time the [Hispanic Monarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habsburg_Spain "Habsburg Spain") had its maximum territorial expansion.

After the [War of the Spanish Succession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_Spanish_Succession "War of the Spanish Succession"), rooted in the political position of the [Count-Duke of Olivares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaspar_de_Guzm%C3%A1n,_Count-Duke_of_Olivares "Gaspar de Guzmán, Count-Duke of Olivares") and the absolutism of [Philip V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_V_of_Spain "Philip V of Spain"), the assimilation of the [Crown of Aragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_of_Aragon "Crown of Aragon") by the [Castilian Crown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_of_Castile "Crown of Castile") through the [Decrees of Nueva Planta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nueva_Planta_decrees "Nueva Planta decrees") was the first step in the creation of the Spanish nation-state. As in other contemporary European states, political union was the first step in the creation of the Spanish nation-state, in this case not on a uniform [ethnic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group "Ethnic group") basis, but through the imposition of the political and cultural characteristics of the dominant ethnic group, in this case the Castilians, over those of other ethnic groups, who became [national minorities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_group "Minority group") to be assimilated.[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-61)[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-62) In fact, since the political unification of 1714, Spanish assimilation policies towards [Catalan-speaking territories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_Countries "Catalan Countries") ([Catalonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalonia "Catalonia"), [Valencia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valencian_Community "Valencian Community"), the [Balearic Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balearic_Islands "Balearic Islands"), part of [Aragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aragon "Aragon")) and other national minorities, as [Basques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basques "Basques") and [Galicians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galicians "Galicians"), have been a historical constant.[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-63)[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-Recopilaci%C3%B3_d'accions_genocides_con-64)[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-:6-65)[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-galeusca2-66)[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-67)

School map of Spain from 1850. On it, the State is divided into four parts: – "Fully constitutional Spain", which includes Castile and the Galician-speaking territories. – "Annexed or assimilated Spain": the territories of the Crown of Aragon, the more significant part of which, except Aragon proper, are Catalan-speaking-, "Foral Spain", which includes Basque-speaking territories, – and "Colonial Spain", with the last overseas colonial territories.

The process of assimilation began with secret instructions to the corregidores of the Catalan territory: they "will take the utmost care to introduce the Castilian language, for which purpose he will give the most temperate and disguised measures so that the effect is achieved, without the care being noticed."[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-Historia_general_de_Espa%C3%B1a:_Llegada-68) From there, actions in the service of assimilation, discreet or aggressive, were continued, and reached to the last detail, such as, in 1799, the Royal Certificate forbidding anyone to "represent, sing and dance pieces that were not in Spanish."[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-Historia_general_de_Espa%C3%B1a:_Llegada-68) These nationalist policies, sometimes very aggressive,[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-69)[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-70)[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-:2-71)[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-:0222-72) and still in force,[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-:3-73)[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-:4-74)[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-:5-75)[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-76) have been, and still are, the seed of repeated territorial conflicts within the State.

Although official Spanish history describes a "natural" decline of the Catalan language and increasing replacement by Spanish between the 16th and 19th centuries, especially among the upper classes, a survey of language usage in 1807, commissioned by [Napoleon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon "Napoleon"), indicates that except in the royal courts, Spanish is absent from everyday life. It is indicated that Catalan "is taught in schools, printed and spoken, not only among the lower class, but also among people of first quality, also in social gatherings, as in visits and congresses", indicating that it is spoken everywhere "except in the royal courts". He also indicates that Catalan is also spoken "in the Kingdom of Valencia, in the islands of Mallorca, Menorca, Ibiza, Sardinia, Corsica and much of Sicily, in the Vall of Aran and Cerdaña".[[76]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-77)

The nationalization process accelerated in the 19th century, in parallel to the origin of [Spanish nationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_nationalism "Spanish nationalism"), the social, political and ideological movement that tried to shape a Spanish national identity based on the Castilian model, in conflict with the other historical nations of the State. Politicians of the time were aware that despite the aggressive policies pursued up to that time, the uniform and monocultural "Spanish nation" did not exist, as indicated in 1835 by [Antonio Alcalà Galiano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Alcal%C3%A1_Galiano "Antonio Alcalá Galiano"), when in the [Cortes del Estatuto Real](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cortes_del_Estatuto_Real&action=edit&redlink=1 "Cortes del Estatuto Real (page does not exist)") he defended the effort

> "To make the Spanish nation a nation that neither is nor has been until now."[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-78)

In 1906, the Catalanist party [Solidaritat Catalana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_Solidarity_(1906) "Catalan Solidarity (1906)") was founded to try to mitigate the economically and culturally oppressive treatment of Spain towards the Catalans. One of the responses of [Spanish nationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_nationalism "Spanish nationalism") came from the military state with statements such as that of the publication [La Correspondencia militar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Correspondencia_Militar "La Correspondencia Militar"): "The Catalan problem is not solved, well, by freedom, but by restriction; not by palliatives and pacts, but by iron and fire". Another came from important Spanish intellectuals, such as [Pio Baroja](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%ADo_Baroja "Pío Baroja") and [Blasco Ibáñez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicente_Blasco_Ib%C3%A1%C3%B1ez "Vicente Blasco Ibáñez"), calling the Catalans "[Jews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews "Jews")", considered a serious insult at that time when [racism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism_in_Europe "Racism in Europe") was gaining strength.[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-:0222-72) Building the nation (as in [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France "France"), it was the state that created the nation, and not the opposite process) is an ideal that the Spanish elites constantly reiterated, and, one hundred years later than Alcalá Galiano, for example, we can also find it in the mouth of the fascist [José Pemartín](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jos%C3%A9_Pemart%C3%ADn&action=edit&redlink=1 "José Pemartín (page does not exist)"), who admired the German and Italian modeling policies:[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-:0222-72)

> "There is an intimate and decisive dualism, both in Italian fascism and in German National Socialism. On the one hand, the Hegelian doctrine of the absolutism of the state is felt. The State originates in the Nation, educates and shapes the mentality of the individual; is, in Mussolini's words, the soul of the soul»

And will be found again two hundred years later, from the socialist [Josep Borrell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josep_Borrell "Josep Borrell"):[[78]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-79)

> The modern history of Spain is an unfortunate history that meant that we did not consolidate a modern State. Independenceists think that the nation makes the State. I think the opposite. The State makes the nation. A strong State, which imposes its language, culture, education.

The turn of the 20th century, and the first half of that century, have seen the most ethnic violence, coinciding with a racism that even came to identify states with races; in the case of Spain, with a supposed Spanish race sublimated in Castilian, of which national minorities were degenerate forms, and the first of those that needed to be exterminated.[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-:0222-72) There were even public proposals for the repression of whole Catalonia, and even the extermination of Catalans, such as that of Juan Pujol, Head of Press and Propaganda of the Junta de Defensa Nacional during the [Spanish Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Civil_War "Spanish Civil War"), in _La Voz de España_,[[79]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-80) or that of [Queipo de Llano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonzalo_Queipo_de_Llano "Gonzalo Queipo de Llano"), in a radio address[[80]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-81)[[81]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-82) in 1936, among others.

The influence of Spanish nationalism could be found in a pogrom in [Argentina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina "Argentina"), during the [Tragic Week](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragic_Week_(Argentina) "Tragic Week (Argentina)"), in 1919.[[82]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-83) It was called to attack Jews and [Catalans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalans "Catalans") indiscriminately, possibly because the influence of [Spanish nationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_nationalism "Spanish nationalism"), which at the time described Catalans as a Semitic ethnicity.[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-:0222-72)

Also, one can find discourses on the alienation of [Catalan speakers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_language "Catalan language"), such as, for example, an article entitled «Cataluña bilingüe», by [Menéndez Pidal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ram%C3%B3n_Men%C3%A9ndez_Pidal "Ramón Menéndez Pidal"), in which he defends the [Romanones decree](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Romanones_decree&action=edit&redlink=1 "Romanones decree (page does not exist)") against the [Catalan language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_language "Catalan language"), published in [El Imparcial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Imparcial_(1867%E2%80%931933) "El Imparcial (1867–1933)"), on 15 December 1902:[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-:0222-72)

> «… There they will see that the Courts of the Catalan-Aragonese Confederation never had Catalan as their official language; that the kings of Aragon, even those of the Catalan dynasty, used Catalan only in Catalonia, and used Spanish not only in the Cortes of Aragon, but also in foreign relations, the same with Castile or Navarre as with the infidel kings of Granada, from Africa or Asia, because even in the most important days of Catalonia, Spanish prevailed as the language of the Aragonese kingdom and Catalan was reserved for the peculiar affairs of the Catalan county..."

or the article "Los Catalanes. A las Cortes Constituyentes», appeared in several newspapers, among others: [El Dia de Alicante](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=El_Dia_de_Alicante&action=edit&redlink=1 "El Dia de Alicante (page does not exist)"), June 23, 1931, [El Porvenir Castellano](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=El_Porvenir_Castellano&action=edit&redlink=1 "El Porvenir Castellano (page does not exist)") and [El Noticiero de Soria](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=El_Noticiero_de_Soria&action=edit&redlink=1 "El Noticiero de Soria (page does not exist)"), July 2, 1931, in the [Heraldo de Almeria](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Heraldo_de_Almeria&action=edit&redlink=1 "Heraldo de Almeria (page does not exist)") on June 4, 1931, sent by the "Pro-Justice Committee", with a post office box in [Madrid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid "Madrid"):[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-:0222-72)

> "The Catalanists have recently declared that they are not Spanish, nor do they want to be, nor can they be. They have also been saying for a long time that they are an oppressed, enslaved, exploited people. It is imperative to do them justice... That they return to Phenicia or that they go wherever they want to admit them. When the Catalan tribes saw Spain and settled in the Spanish territory that is now occupied by the provinces of Barcelona, Gerona, Lérida and Tarragona, how little they imagined that the case of the captivity of the tribes of Israel in Egypt would be repeated there!!... Let us respect his most holy will. They are eternally inadaptable... Their cowardice and selfishness leaves them no room for fraternity... So, we propose to the Constituent Cortes the expulsion of the Catalanists... You are free! The Republic opens wide the doors of Spain, your prison. go away Get out of here. Go back to Phenicia, or go wherever you want, how big is the world."

The main scapegoat of Spanish nationalism is the non-Spanish languages, which over the last three hundred years have been tried to be replaced by Spanish with hundreds of laws and regulations,[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-:2-71) but also with acts of great violence, such as during the civil war. For example, the statements of Queipo de Llano can be found in the article entitled "Against Catalonia, the Israel of the Modern World", published in the [Diario Palentino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diario_Palentino "Diario Palentino") on November 26, 1936, where it is dropped that in [America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas "Americas") Catalans are considered a race of [Jews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews "Jews"), because they use the same procedures that the [Hebrews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrews "Hebrews") perform in all the nations of the Globe. And considering the Catalans as Hebrews and considering his [anti-Semitism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism "Antisemitism") "Our struggle is not a civil war, but a war for Western civilization against the Jewish world," it is not surprising that Queipo de Llano expressed his [anti-Catalan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Catalanism "Anti-Catalanism") intentions: "When the war is over, Pompeu Fabra and his works will be dragged along the Ramblas"[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-:0222-72) (it was not talk to talk, the house of [Pompeu Fabra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pompeu_Fabra "Pompeu Fabra"), the standardizer of Catalan language, was raided and his huge personal library burned in the middle of the street. Pompeu Fabra was able to escape into exile).[[83]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-84) Another example of [fascist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism "Fascism") aggression towards the Catalan language is pointed out by [Paul Preston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Preston "Paul Preston") in "The Spanish Holocaust",[[84]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-Holo2-85) given that during the civil war it practically led to an ethnic conflict:

> "In the days following the occupation of Lleida (…), the republican prisoners identified as Catalans were executed without trial. Anyone who heard them speak Catalan was very likely to be arrested. The arbitrary brutality of the anti-Catalan repression reached such a point that Franco himself had to issue an order ordering that mistakes that could later be regretted be avoided ". "There are examples of the murder of peasants for no other apparent reason than that of speaking Catalan"

After a possible attempt at [ethnic cleansing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_cleansing "Ethnic cleansing"),[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-Recopilaci%C3%B3_d'accions_genocides_con-64)[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-:0222-72) the [biopolitical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopolitics "Biopolitics") imposition of Spanish during the [Franco dictatorship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francoist_Spain "Francoist Spain"), to the point of being considered an attempt at [cultural genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_genocide "Cultural genocide"), democracy consolidated an apparent asymmetric regime of [bilingualism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilingualism "Bilingualism") of sorts, wherein the Spanish government has employed a system of laws that favored Spanish over Catalan,[[85]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-86)[[86]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-87)[[87]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-88)[[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-89)[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-:3-73)[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-:4-74)[[89]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-90)[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-:5-75) which becomes the weaker of the two languages, and therefore, in the absence of other states where it is spoken, is doomed to extinction in the medium or short term. In the same vein, its use in the Spanish Congress is prevented,[[90]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-91)[[91]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-92) and it is prevented from achieving official status Europe, unlike less spoken languages such as [Gaelic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goidelic_languages "Goidelic languages").[[92]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-93) In other institutional areas, such as justice, [Plataforma per la Llengua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plataforma_per_la_Llengua "Plataforma per la Llengua") has denounced [Catalanophobia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Catalanism "Anti-Catalanism"). The association [Soberania i Justícia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Soberania_i_Just%C3%ADcia&action=edit&redlink=1 "Soberania i Justícia (page does not exist)") have also denounced it in an act in the [European Parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament "European Parliament"). It also takes the form of [linguistic secessionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_secessionism "Linguistic secessionism"), originally advocated by the Spanish extreme right and which has finally been adopted by the Spanish government itself and state bodies.[[93]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-dbalears.cat-94)[[94]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-95)[[95]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-96)

In November 2005, [Omnium Cultural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%92mnium_Cultural "Òmnium Cultural") organized a meeting of Catalan and Madrid intellectuals in the [Círculo de bellas artes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%ADrculo_de_Bellas_Artes "Círculo de Bellas Artes") in Madrid to show support for ongoing reform of Catalan Statute of Autonomy, which sought to resolve territorial tensions, and among other things better protect the Catalan language. On the Catalan side, a flight was made with one hundred representatives of the cultural, civic, intellectual, artistic and sporting world of Catalonia, but on the Spanish side, except [Santiago Carrillo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_Carrillo "Santiago Carrillo"), a politician from the [Second Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Spanish_Republic "Second Spanish Republic"), did not attend any more.[[96]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-97)[[97]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-98) The subsequent failure of the statutory reform with respect to its objectives opened the door to the growth of Catalan sovereignty.[[98]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-99)

Apart from language discrimination by public officials,[[99]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-100)[[100]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-101) e.g. in the hospitals,[[101]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-102) the prohibition until September 2023 (47 years after Franco's death) of using the Catalan language in state institutions such as Court,[[102]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-103) despite being the former [Crown of Aragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_of_Aragon "Crown of Aragon"), with three Catalan-speaking territories, one of the co-founders of the current Spanish state, is nothing more than the continuation of the foreignization of Catalan-speaking people from the first third of the 20th century, in full swing of state racism and [fascism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism "Fascism"). It also can be pointed the [linguistic secessionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_secessionism "Linguistic secessionism"), originally advocated by the Spanish far right and which has finally been adopted by the Spanish government itself and state bodies.[[93]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-dbalears.cat-94)[[103]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-104) By fragmenting Catalan language into as many languages as territories, it becomes inoperative, economically suffocated, and becomes a political toy in the hands of territorial politicians.

Susceptible to be classified as an [ethnic democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_democracy "Ethnic democracy"), the Spanish State currently only recognizes the [Romani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_people "Romani people") as a national minority, excluding [Catalans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalans "Catalans") (and, of course, Valencians and Balearic), [Basques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basques "Basques") and [Galicians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galicians "Galicians"). However, it is evident to any external observer that there are social diversities within the Spanish State that qualify as manifestations of national minorities, such as, for example, the existence of the main three linguistic minorities in their ancestral territories.[[104]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-:042-105)

The [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom "United Kingdom") is an unusual example of a nation state due to its "countries within a [country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country "Country")". The United Kingdom is formed by the union of [England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England "England"), [Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland "Scotland"), [Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales "Wales") and [Northern Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland "Northern Ireland"), but it is a [unitary state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitary_state "Unitary state") formed initially by the merger of two independent kingdoms, the [Kingdom of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_England "Kingdom of England") (which already included Wales) and the [Kingdom of Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Scotland "Kingdom of Scotland"), but the [Treaty of Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Union "Treaty of Union") (1707) that set out the agreed terms has ensured the continuation of distinct features of each state, including separate [legal systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_in_the_United_Kingdom "Law in the United Kingdom") and separate [national churches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_the_United_Kingdom "Religion in the United Kingdom").[[105]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-106)[[106]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-107)[[107]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-108)

In 2003, the [British Government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Government "British Government") described the United Kingdom as "countries within a country".[[108]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-109) While the [Office for National Statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_for_National_Statistics "Office for National Statistics") and others describe the United Kingdom as a "nation state",[[109]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-110)[[110]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-111) others, including a then Prime Minister, describe it as a "[multinational state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinational_state "Multinational state")",[[111]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-112)[[112]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-113)[[113]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-114) and the term [Home Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Nations "Home Nations") is used to describe the four national teams that represent the four nations of the United Kingdom ([England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England "England"), [Northern Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland "Northern Ireland"), [Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland "Scotland"), [Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales "Wales")).[[114]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-115) Some refer to it as a "Union State".[[115]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-116)[[116]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-117)

The most obvious deviation from the ideal of "one nation, one state" is the presence of minorities, especially [ethnic minorities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_minorities "Ethnic minorities"), which are clearly not members of the majority nation. An ethnic nationalist definition of a [nation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation "Nation") is necessarily exclusive: ethnic nations typically do not have open membership. In most cases, there is a clear idea that surrounding nations are different, and that includes members of those nations who live on the "wrong side" of the border. Historical examples of groups who have been specifically singled out as _outsiders_ are the [Roma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_people "Romani people") and [Jews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews "Jews") in Europe.

Negative responses to minorities within the nation state have ranged from [cultural assimilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_assimilation "Cultural assimilation") enforced by the state, to [expulsion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_cleansing "Ethnic cleansing"), persecution, violence, and [extermination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide "Genocide"). The assimilation policies are usually enforced by the state, but violence against minorities is not always state-initiated: it can occur in the form of [mob violence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mob_violence "Mob violence") such as [lynching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynching "Lynching") or [pogroms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pogrom "Pogrom"). Nation states are responsible for some of the worst historical examples of violence against minorities not considered part of the nation.

However, many nation states accept specific minorities as being part of the nation, and the term _national minority_ is often used in this sense. The [Sorbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorbs "Sorbs") in Germany are an example: for centuries they have lived in German-speaking states, surrounded by a much larger ethnic German population, and they have no other historical territory. They are now generally considered to be part of the German nation and are accepted as such by the Federal Republic of Germany, which constitutionally guarantees their cultural rights. Of the thousands of ethnic and cultural minorities in nation states across the world, only a few have this level of acceptance and protection.

[Multiculturalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiculturalism "Multiculturalism") is an official policy in some states, establishing the ideal of coexisting existence among multiple and separate ethnic, cultural, and linguistic groups. Other states prefer the [interculturalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interculturalism "Interculturalism") (or "[melting pot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melting_pot "Melting pot")" approach) alternative to multiculturalism, citing [problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_multiculturalism "Criticism of multiculturalism") with latter as promoting [self-segregation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-segregation "Self-segregation") tendencies among minority groups, challenging national cohesion, polarizing society in groups that can't relate to one another, generating problems in regard to minorities and immigrants' fluency in the national language of use and integration with the rest of society (generating hate and persecution against them from the "otherness" they would generate in such a case according to its adherents), without minorities having to give up certain parts of their culture before being absorbed into a now changed majority culture by their contribution. Many nations have laws protecting [minority rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_rights "Minority rights").

When national boundaries that do not match ethnic boundaries are drawn, such as in the [Balkans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkans "Balkans") and [Central Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Asia "Central Asia"), ethnic tension, massacres and even [genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide "Genocide"), sometimes has occurred historically (see [Bosnian genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosnian_genocide "Bosnian genocide") and [2010 South Kyrgyzstan ethnic clashes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_South_Kyrgyzstan_ethnic_clashes "2010 South Kyrgyzstan ethnic clashes")).

In principle, the border of a nation state would extend far enough to include all the members of the nation, and all of the national [homeland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeland "Homeland"). Again, in practice, some of them always live on the 'wrong side' of the border. Part of the national homeland may be there too, and it may be governed by the 'wrong' nation. The response to the non-inclusion of territory and population may take the form of irredentism: demands to annex _unredeemed_ territory and incorporate it into the nation state.

Irredentist claims are usually based on the fact that an identifiable part of the national group lives across the border. However, they can include claims to territory where no members of that nation live at present, because they lived there in the past, the national language is spoken in that region, the national culture has influenced it, geographical unity with the existing territory, or a wide variety of other reasons. Past grievances are usually involved and can cause [revanchism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revanchism "Revanchism").

It is sometimes difficult to distinguish irredentism from [pan-nationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan-nationalism "Pan-nationalism"), since both claim that all members of an ethnic and cultural nation belong in one specific state. Pan-nationalism is less likely to specify the nation ethnically. For instance, variants of [Pan-Germanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan-Germanism "Pan-Germanism") have different ideas about what constituted [Greater Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleindeutschland_and_Gro%C3%9Fdeutschland "Kleindeutschland and Großdeutschland"), including the confusing term _Grossdeutschland_, which, in fact, implied the inclusion of huge [Slavic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slav "Slav") minorities from the [Austro-Hungarian Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austro-Hungarian_Empire "Austro-Hungarian Empire").

Typically, irredentist demands are at first made by members of non-state nationalist movements. When they are adopted by a state, they typically result in tensions, and actual attempts at annexation are always considered a _[casus belli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casus\_belli "Casus belli")_, a cause for [war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War "War"). In many cases, such claims result in long-term hostile relations between neighbouring states. Irredentist movements typically circulate maps of the claimed national territory, the _greater_ nation state. That territory, which is often much larger than the existing state, plays a central role in their propaganda.

Irredentism should not be confused with claims to overseas colonies, which are not generally considered part of the national homeland. Some French overseas colonies would be an exception: [French rule in Algeria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_rule_in_Algeria "French rule in Algeria") unsuccessfully treated the colony as a _[département](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%A9partement\_in\_France "Département in France")_ of France.

It has been speculated by both proponents of [globalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globalization "Globalization") and various [science fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction "Science fiction") writers that the concept of a nation state may disappear with the ever-increasing interconnectedness of the world.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-ref1-25) Such ideas are sometimes expressed around concepts of a [world government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_government "World government"). Another possibility is a move into communal anarchy or zero world government, in which nation states no longer exist.

### Clash of civilizations

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nation_state&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Clash of civilizations")]

The theory of the [clash of civilizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clash_of_civilizations "Clash of civilizations") lies in direct contrast to [cosmopolitan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmopolitanism "Cosmopolitanism") theories about an ever more connected world that no longer requires nation states. According to [political scientist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_scientist "Political scientist")[Samuel P. Huntington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_P._Huntington "Samuel P. Huntington"), people's cultural and religious [identities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_(social_science) "Identity (social science)") will be the primary source of conflict in the post–[Cold War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War "Cold War") world.

The theory was originally formulated in a 1992 lecture[[117]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-118) at the [American Enterprise Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Enterprise_Institute "American Enterprise Institute"), which was then developed in a 1993 _[Foreign Affairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign\_Affairs "Foreign Affairs")_ article titled "The Clash of Civilizations?",[[118]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-FAarticle-119) in response to [Francis Fukuyama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Fukuyama "Francis Fukuyama")'s 1992 book, _[The End of History and the Last Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_End\_of\_History\_and\_the\_Last\_Man "The End of History and the Last Man")_. Huntington later expanded his [thesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thesis "Thesis") in a 1996 book _The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order_.

Huntington began his thinking by surveying the diverse theories about the nature of global politics in the post–Cold War period. Some theorists and writers argued that [human rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights "Human rights"), [liberal democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_democracy "Liberal democracy") and capitalist [free market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_market "Free market") economics had become the only remaining ideological alternative for nations in the post–Cold War world. Specifically, Francis Fukuyama, in _The End of History and the Last Man_, argued that the world had reached a [Hegelian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Hegel "Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel") "end of history".

Huntington believed that while the age of [ideology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideology "Ideology") had ended, the world had reverted only to a normal state of affairs characterized by cultural conflict. In his thesis, he argued that the primary axis of conflict in the future will be along cultural and religious lines.

As an extension, he posits that the concept of different [civilizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization "Civilization"), as the highest rank of cultural identity, will become increasingly useful in analyzing the potential for conflict.

In the 1993 _Foreign Affairs_ article, Huntington writes:

> It is my hypothesis that the fundamental source of conflict in this new world will not be primarily ideological or primarily economic. The great divisions among humankind and the dominating source of conflict will be cultural. Nation states will remain the most powerful actors in world affairs, but the principal conflicts of global politics will occur between nations and groups of different civilizations. The clash of civilizations will dominate global politics. The fault lines between civilizations will be the battle lines of the future.[[118]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-FAarticle-119)

[Sandra Joireman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandra_Joireman "Sandra Joireman") suggests that Huntington may be characterised as a neo-[primordialist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primordialism "Primordialism"), as, while he sees people as having strong ties to their ethnicity, he does not believe that these ties have always existed.[[119]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-Joireman-120)

Historians often look to the past to find the origins of a particular nation state. Indeed, they often put so much emphasis on the importance of the nation state in modern times, that they distort the history of earlier periods in order to emphasize the question of origins. Lansing and English argue that much of the medieval history of Europe was structured to follow the historical winners—especially the nation states that emerged around Paris and London. Important developments that did not directly lead to a nation state get neglected, they argue:

one effect of this approach has been to privilege historical winners, aspects of medieval Europe that became important in later centuries, above all the nation state.... Arguably the liveliest cultural innovation in the 13th century was the Mediterranean, centered on [Frederick II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor "Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor")'s polyglot court and administration in Palermo...Sicily and the Italian South in later centuries suffered a long slide into overtaxed poverty and marginality. Textbook narratives, therefore, focus not on medieval Palermo, with its Muslim and Jewish bureaucracies and Arabic-speaking monarch, but on the historical winners, Paris and London.[[120]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty#cite_note-121)
