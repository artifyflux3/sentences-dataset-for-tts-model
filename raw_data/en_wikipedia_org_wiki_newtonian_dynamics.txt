In physics, Newtonian dynamics (also known as Newtonian mechanics ) is the study of the dynamics of a particle or a small body according to Newton's laws of motion .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Mathematical generalizations [ edit ] Typically, the Newtonian dynamics occurs in a three-dimensional Euclidean space , which is flat. However, in mathematics Newton's laws of motion can be generalized to multidimensional and curved spaces. Often the term Newtonian dynamics is narrowed to Newton's second law m a = F {\displaystyle \displaystyle m\,\mathbf {a} =\mathbf {F} } .

Newton's second law in a multidimensional space [ edit ] Consider N {\displaystyle \displaystyle N} particles with masses m 1 , … … , m N {\displaystyle \displaystyle m_{1},\,\ldots ,\,m_{N}} in the regular three-dimensional Euclidean space . Let r 1 , … … , r N {\displaystyle \displaystyle \mathbf {r} _{1},\,\ldots ,\,\mathbf {r} _{N}} be their radius-vectors in some inertial coordinate system. Then the motion of these particles is governed by Newton's second law applied to each of them d r i d t = v i , d v i d t = F i ( r 1 , … … , r N , v 1 , … … , v N , t ) m i , i = 1 , … … , N .

{\displaystyle {\frac {d\mathbf {r} _{i}}{dt}}=\mathbf {v} _{i},\qquad {\frac {d\mathbf {v} _{i}}{dt}}={\frac {\mathbf {F} _{i}(\mathbf {r} _{1},\ldots ,\mathbf {r} _{N},\mathbf {v} _{1},\ldots ,\mathbf {v} _{N},t)}{m_{i}}},\quad i=1,\ldots ,N.} 1 The three-dimensional radius-vectors r 1 , … … , r N {\displaystyle \displaystyle \mathbf {r} _{1},\,\ldots ,\,\mathbf {r} _{N}} can be built into a single n = 3 N {\displaystyle \displaystyle n=3N} -dimensional radius-vector. Similarly, three-dimensional velocity vectors v 1 , … … , v N {\displaystyle \displaystyle \mathbf {v} _{1},\,\ldots ,\,\mathbf {v} _{N}} can be built into a single n = 3 N {\displaystyle \displaystyle n=3N} -dimensional velocity vector: r = ‖ r 1 ⋮ ⋮ r N ‖ , v = ‖ v 1 ⋮ ⋮ v N ‖ .

{\displaystyle \mathbf {r} ={\begin{Vmatrix}\mathbf {r} _{1}\\\vdots \\\mathbf {r} _{N}\end{Vmatrix}},\qquad \qquad \mathbf {v} ={\begin{Vmatrix}\mathbf {v} _{1}\\\vdots \\\mathbf {v} _{N}\end{Vmatrix}}.} 2 In terms of the multidimensional vectors ( 2 ) the equations ( 1 ) are written as d r d t = v , d v d t = F ( r , v , t ) , {\displaystyle {\frac {d\mathbf {r} }{dt}}=\mathbf {v} ,\qquad {\frac {d\mathbf {v} }{dt}}=\mathbf {F} (\mathbf {r} ,\mathbf {v} ,t),} 3 i.e. they take the form of Newton's second law applied to a single particle with the unit mass m = 1 {\displaystyle \displaystyle m=1} .

Definition . The equations ( 3 ) are called the
equations of a Newtonian dynamical system in a flat multidimensional Euclidean space , which is called the configuration space of this system. Its points are marked by the radius-vector r {\displaystyle \displaystyle \mathbf {r} } . The space whose points are marked by the pair of vectors ( r , v ) {\displaystyle \displaystyle (\mathbf {r} ,\mathbf {v} )} is called the phase space of the dynamical system ( 3 ).

Euclidean structure [ edit ] The configuration space and the phase space of the dynamical system ( 3 ) both are Euclidean spaces, i. e. they are equipped with a Euclidean structure. The Euclidean structure of them is defined so that the kinetic energy of the single multidimensional particle with the unit mass m = 1 {\displaystyle \displaystyle m=1} is equal to the sum of kinetic energies of the three-dimensional particles with the masses m 1 , … … , m N {\displaystyle \displaystyle m_{1},\,\ldots ,\,m_{N}} : T = ‖ ‖ v ‖ ‖ 2 2 = ∑ ∑ i = 1 N m i ‖ ‖ v i ‖ ‖ 2 2 {\displaystyle T={\frac {\Vert \mathbf {v} \Vert ^{2}}{2}}=\sum _{i=1}^{N}m_{i}\,{\frac {\Vert \mathbf {v} _{i}\Vert ^{2}}{2}}} .

4 Constraints and internal coordinates [ edit ] In some cases the motion of the particles with the masses m 1 , … … , m N {\displaystyle \displaystyle m_{1},\,\ldots ,\,m_{N}} can be constrained. Typical constraints look like scalar equations of the form φ φ i ( r 1 , … … , r N ) = 0 , i = 1 , … … , K {\displaystyle \displaystyle \varphi _{i}(\mathbf {r} _{1},\ldots ,\mathbf {r} _{N})=0,\quad i=1,\,\ldots ,\,K} .

5 Constraints of the form ( 5 ) are called holonomic and scleronomic . In terms of the radius-vector r {\displaystyle \displaystyle \mathbf {r} } of the Newtonian dynamical system ( 3 ) they are written as φ φ i ( r ) = 0 , i = 1 , … … , K {\displaystyle \displaystyle \varphi _{i}(\mathbf {r} )=0,\quad i=1,\,\ldots ,\,K} .

6 Each such constraint reduces by one the number of degrees of freedom of the Newtonian dynamical system ( 3 ). Therefore, the constrained system has n = 3 N − − K {\displaystyle \displaystyle n=3\,N-K} degrees of freedom.

Definition . The constraint equations ( 6 ) define an n {\displaystyle \displaystyle n} -dimensional manifold M {\displaystyle \displaystyle M} within the configuration space of the Newtonian dynamical system ( 3 ). This manifold M {\displaystyle \displaystyle M} is called the configuration space of the constrained system. Its tangent bundle T M {\displaystyle \displaystyle TM} is called the phase space of the constrained system.

Let q 1 , … … , q n {\displaystyle \displaystyle q^{1},\,\ldots ,\,q^{n}} be the internal coordinates of a point of M {\displaystyle \displaystyle M} . Their usage is typical for the Lagrangian mechanics . The radius-vector r {\displaystyle \displaystyle \mathbf {r} } is expressed as some definite function of q 1 , … … , q n {\displaystyle \displaystyle q^{1},\,\ldots ,\,q^{n}} : r = r ( q 1 , … … , q n ) {\displaystyle \displaystyle \mathbf {r} =\mathbf {r} (q^{1},\,\ldots ,\,q^{n})} .

7 The vector-function ( 7 ) resolves the constraint equations ( 6 ) in the sense that upon substituting ( 7 ) into ( 6 ) the equations ( 6 ) are fulfilled identically in q 1 , … … , q n {\displaystyle \displaystyle q^{1},\,\ldots ,\,q^{n}} .

Internal presentation of the velocity vector [ edit ] The velocity vector of the constrained Newtonian dynamical system is expressed in terms of the partial derivatives of the vector-function
( 7 ): v = ∑ ∑ i = 1 n ∂ ∂ r ∂ ∂ q i q ˙ ˙ i {\displaystyle \displaystyle \mathbf {v} =\sum _{i=1}^{n}{\frac {\partial \mathbf {r} }{\partial q^{i}}}\,{\dot {q}}^{i}} .

8 The quantities q ˙ ˙ 1 , … … , q ˙ ˙ n {\displaystyle \displaystyle {\dot {q}}^{1},\,\ldots ,\,{\dot {q}}^{n}} are called internal components of the velocity vector. Sometimes they are denoted with the use of a separate symbol q ˙ ˙ i = w i , i = 1 , … … , n {\displaystyle \displaystyle {\dot {q}}^{i}=w^{i},\qquad i=1,\,\ldots ,\,n} 9 and then treated as independent variables. The quantities q 1 , … … , q n , w 1 , … … , w n {\displaystyle \displaystyle q^{1},\,\ldots ,\,q^{n},\,w^{1},\,\ldots ,\,w^{n}} 10 are used as internal coordinates of a point of the phase space T M {\displaystyle \displaystyle TM} of the constrained Newtonian dynamical system.

Embedding and the induced Riemannian metric [ edit ] Geometrically, the vector-function ( 7 ) implements an embedding of the configuration space M {\displaystyle \displaystyle M} of the constrained Newtonian dynamical system into the 3 N {\displaystyle \displaystyle 3\,N} -dimensional flat configuration space of the unconstrained 
Newtonian dynamical system ( 3 ). Due to this embedding the Euclidean structure of the ambient space induces the Riemannian metric onto the manifold M {\displaystyle \displaystyle M} . The components of the metric tensor of this induced metric are given by the formula g i j = ( ∂ ∂ r ∂ ∂ q i , ∂ ∂ r ∂ ∂ q j ) {\displaystyle \displaystyle g_{ij}=\left({\frac {\partial \mathbf {r} }{\partial q^{i}}},{\frac {\partial \mathbf {r} }{\partial q^{j}}}\right)} , 11 where ( , ) {\displaystyle \displaystyle (\ ,\ )} is the scalar product associated with the Euclidean structure ( 4 ).

Kinetic energy of a constrained Newtonian dynamical system [ edit ] Since the Euclidean structure of an unconstrained system of N {\displaystyle \displaystyle N} particles is introduced through their kinetic energy, the induced Riemannian structure on the configuration space N {\displaystyle \displaystyle N} of a constrained system preserves this relation to the kinetic energy: T = 1 2 ∑ ∑ i = 1 n ∑ ∑ j = 1 n g i j w i w j {\displaystyle T={\frac {1}{2}}\sum _{i=1}^{n}\sum _{j=1}^{n}g_{ij}\,w^{i}\,w^{j}} .

12 The formula ( 12 ) is derived by substituting ( 8 ) into ( 4 ) and taking into account ( 11 ).

Constraint forces [ edit ] For a constrained Newtonian dynamical system the constraints described by the equations ( 6 ) are usually implemented by some mechanical framework. This framework produces some auxiliary forces including the force that maintains the system within its configuration manifold M {\displaystyle \displaystyle M} . Such a maintaining force is perpendicular to M {\displaystyle \displaystyle M} . It is called the normal force . The force F {\displaystyle \displaystyle \mathbf {F} } from ( 6 ) is subdivided into two components F = F ∥ ∥ + F ⊥ ⊥ {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} =\mathbf {F} _{\parallel }+\mathbf {F} _{\perp }} .

13 The first component in ( 13 ) is tangent to the configuration manifold M {\displaystyle \displaystyle M} . The second component is perpendicular to M {\displaystyle \displaystyle M} . In coincides with the normal force N {\displaystyle \displaystyle \mathbf {N} } .

Like the velocity vector ( 8 ), the tangent force F ∥ ∥ {\displaystyle \displaystyle \mathbf {F} _{\parallel }} has its internal presentation F ∥ ∥ = ∑ ∑ i = 1 n ∂ ∂ r ∂ ∂ q i F i {\displaystyle \displaystyle \mathbf {F} _{\parallel }=\sum _{i=1}^{n}{\frac {\partial \mathbf {r} }{\partial q^{i}}}\,F^{i}} .

14 The quantities F 1 , … … , F n {\displaystyle F^{1},\,\ldots ,\,F^{n}} in ( 14 ) are called the internal components of the force vector.

Newton's second law in a curved space [ edit ] The Newtonian dynamical system ( 3 ) constrained to the configuration manifold M {\displaystyle \displaystyle M} by the constraint equations ( 6 ) is described by the differential equations d q s d t = w s , d w s d t + ∑ ∑ i = 1 n ∑ ∑ j = 1 n Γ Γ i j s w i w j = F s , s = 1 , … … , n {\displaystyle {\frac {dq^{s}}{dt}}=w^{s},\qquad {\frac {dw^{s}}{dt}}+\sum _{i=1}^{n}\sum _{j=1}^{n}\Gamma _{ij}^{s}\,w^{i}\,w^{j}=F^{s},\qquad s=1,\,\ldots ,\,n} , 15 where Γ Γ i j s {\displaystyle \Gamma _{ij}^{s}} are Christoffel symbols of the metric connection produced by the Riemannian metric ( 11 ).

Relation to Lagrange equations [ edit ] Mechanical systems with constraints are usually described by Lagrange equations : d q s d t = w s , d d t ( ∂ ∂ T ∂ ∂ w s ) − − ∂ ∂ T ∂ ∂ q s = Q s , s = 1 , … … , n {\displaystyle {\frac {dq^{s}}{dt}}=w^{s},\qquad {\frac {d}{dt}}\left({\frac {\partial T}{\partial w^{s}}}\right)-{\frac {\partial T}{\partial q^{s}}}=Q_{s},\qquad s=1,\,\ldots ,\,n} , 16 where T = T ( q 1 , … … , q n , w 1 , … … , w n ) {\displaystyle T=T(q^{1},\ldots ,q^{n},w^{1},\ldots ,w^{n})} is the kinetic energy the constrained dynamical system given by the formula ( 12 ). The quantities Q 1 , … … , Q n {\displaystyle Q_{1},\,\ldots ,\,Q_{n}} in 
( 16 ) are the inner covariant components of the tangent force vector F ∥ ∥ {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} _{\parallel }} (see ( 13 ) and ( 14 )). They are produced from the inner contravariant components F 1 , … … , F n {\displaystyle F^{1},\,\ldots ,\,F^{n}} of the vector F ∥ ∥ {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} _{\parallel }} by means of the standard index lowering procedure using the metric ( 11 ): Q s = ∑ ∑ r = 1 n g s r F r , s = 1 , … … , n {\displaystyle Q_{s}=\sum _{r=1}^{n}g_{sr}\,F^{r},\qquad s=1,\,\ldots ,\,n} , 17 The equations ( 16 ) are equivalent to the equations ( 15 ). However, the metric ( 11 ) and
other geometric features of the configuration manifold M {\displaystyle \displaystyle M} are not explicit in ( 16 ). The metric ( 11 ) can be recovered from the kinetic energy T {\displaystyle \displaystyle T} by means of the formula g i j = ∂ ∂ 2 T ∂ ∂ w i ∂ ∂ w j {\displaystyle g_{ij}={\frac {\partial ^{2}T}{\partial w^{i}\,\partial w^{j}}}} .
