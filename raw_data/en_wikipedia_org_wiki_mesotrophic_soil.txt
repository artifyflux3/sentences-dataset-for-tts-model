An indicator of soil fertility is its base status, which is expressed as a ratio relating the major nutrient cations ( calcium , magnesium , potassium and sodium ) found there to the soil's clay percentage. This is commonly expressed in hundredths of a mole of cations per kilogram of clay, i.e. cmol (+) kg −1 clay.
