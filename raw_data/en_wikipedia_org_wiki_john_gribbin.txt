Gribbin ( 1946-03-19 ) 19 March 1946 (age 79) Maidstone , Kent, England Occupation Science writer and journalist Nationality British Alma mater University of Sussex ( BA , MSc ) University of Cambridge ( PhD ) Period Last quarter of the 20th century, beginning of the 21st century Genre Science (origins of the universe, astronomy, cosmology); biography; fiction Subject Astronomy and astrophysics; popularising science and its history; climate change and global warming Spouse Mary Gribbin John R. Gribbin (born 19 March 1946) [ 1 ] is a British science writer, an astrophysicist , and a visiting fellow in astronomy at the University of Sussex .

[ 2 ] His writings include quantum physics , human evolution , climate change , global warming , the origins of the universe, and biographies of famous scientists. He also writes science fiction.

Biography [ edit ] John Gribbin graduated with his bachelor's degree in physics from the University of Sussex in 1966. Gribbin then earned his Master of Science (MSc) degree in astronomy in 1967, also from the University of Sussex, and he earned his PhD in astrophysics from the University of Cambridge (1971).

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] In 1968, Gribbin worked as one of Fred Hoyle 's research students at the Institute of Theoretical Astronomy , and wrote a number of stories for New Scientist about the Institute's research and what were eventually discovered to be pulsars .

[ 5 ] In 1974, Gribbin, along with Stephen Plagemann , published a book titled The Jupiter Effect , which predicted that the alignment of the planets in a quadrant on one side of the Sun on 10 March 1982 would cause gravitational effects that would trigger earthquakes in the San Andreas Fault , possibly wiping out Los Angeles and its suburbs.

[ 6 ] Gribbin distanced himself from The Jupiter Effect in the 17 July 1980, issue of New Scientist magazine, stating that he had been "too clever by half".

[ 7 ] In February 1982, he and Plagemann published The Jupiter Effect Reconsidered , claiming that the 1980 Mount St. Helens eruption proved their theory true despite a lack of planetary alignment. In 1999, Gribbin repudiated it, saying "I don't like it, and I'm sorry I ever had anything to do with it." [ 8 ] In 1984, Gribbin published In Search of Schrödinger's Cat: Quantum Physics and Reality .

[ 9 ] The Spectator Book Club described it as among the best of the first wave of physics popularisations preceding Stephen Hawking 's multi-million-selling A Brief History of Time .

[ 10 ] Gribbin's book was cited by BBC World News as an example of how to revive an interest in the study of mathematics.

[ 11 ] Gribbin was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1999.

[ 12 ] In 2006, Gribbin took part in a BBC radio 4 broadcast as an "expert witness". Presenter Matthew Parris discussed with Professor Kathy Sykes and Gribbin whether Albert Einstein "really was a 'crazy genius ' ".

[ 13 ] At the 2009 World Conference of Science Journalists, the Association of British Science Writers presented Gribbin with their Lifetime Achievement award.

[ 14 ] Critical response to Gribbin's writings [ edit ] The conservative political magazine The Spectator described Gribbin as "one of the finest and most prolific writers of popular science around" in a review of Science: A History , which it praises as "the product of immense learning, and a lifetime spent working out how to write in a vivacious way about science and scientists".

[ 10 ] Henry Gee, a senior editor at Nature , described Gribbin as "one of the best science writers around".

[ citation needed ] A review of The Universe: A Biography in the journal Physics World praised his skill in explaining difficult ideas.

[ 15 ] A Wall Street Journal review of Flower Hunters (co-authored with Mary Gribbin) described the writing as "pedestrian", with plenty of domestic detail but a failure to convey a larger cultural context. It stated that the book's chapter-length biographical sketches are too often superficial, and criticised the book for glaring omissions of prominent plant collectors.

[ 16 ] In a review of The Reason Why , the Times Higher Education states that Gribbin writes on speculative matters and presents some of his theories without supporting evidence, but noted his comprehensive research and lyrical writing.
