Philosophical fiction Features Significant proportion devoted to discussion of questions normally addressed in discursive philosophy Subgenres Novel of ideas Philosophical fiction is any fiction that devotes a significant portion of its content to the sort of questions addressed by philosophy . It might explore any facet of the human condition , including the function and role of society, the nature and motivation of human acts, the purpose of life , ethics or morals, the role of art in human lives, the role of experience or reason in the development of knowledge, whether there exists free will , or any other topic of philosophical interest. Philosophical fiction includes the novel of ideas , which can also fall under the genre of science fiction , utopian and dystopian fiction , and bildungsroman .

There is no universally accepted definition of philosophical fiction, but a sampling of notable works can help to outline its history. For example, a Platonic dialogue could be considered philosophical fiction.

[ 1 ] Some modern philosophers have written novels, plays, or short fiction in order to demonstrate or introduce their ideas. Common examples include Voltaire , Fyodor Dostoevsky , Thomas Mann , Hermann Hesse , Albert Camus , Jean-Paul Sartre , Simone de Beauvoir and Ayn Rand . Authors who admire certain philosophers may incorporate their ideas into the principal themes or central narratives of novels. Some examples include The Moviegoer ( Walker Percy ), Thus Spoke Zarathustra ( Nietzsche ), Wittgenstein's Mistress ( David Markson ), and Speedboat ( post-structuralism ).
