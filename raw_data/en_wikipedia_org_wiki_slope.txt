Slope: ![Image 2: {\displaystyle m={\frac {\Delta y}{\Delta x}}=\tan(\theta )}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/98d19d47ccaae2f4027a94e0b7ca6c8434d7685e)

In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), the **slope** or **gradient** of a [line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_(mathematics) "Line (mathematics)") is a number that describes the [direction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direction_(geometry) "Direction (geometry)") of the line on a [plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(geometry) "Plane (geometry)").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slope#cite_note-1) Often denoted by the letter _m_, slope is calculated as the [ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio "Ratio") of the vertical change to the horizontal change ("rise over run") between two distinct points on the line, giving the same number for any choice of points.

The line may be physical – as set by a [road surveyor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying "Surveying"), pictorial as in a [diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagram "Diagram") of a road or roof, or [abstract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_mathematics "Pure mathematics"). An application of the mathematical concept is found in the [grade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(slope) "Grade (slope)") or [gradient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient "Gradient") in [geography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography "Geography") and [civil engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_engineering "Civil engineering").

The _steepness_, incline, or grade of a line is the [absolute value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_value "Absolute value") of its slope: greater absolute value indicates a steeper line. The line trend is defined as follows:

Special directions are:

If two points of a road have altitudes _y_ 1 and _y_ 2, the rise is the difference (_y_ 2 − _y_ 1) = Δ _y_. Neglecting the [Earth's curvature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figure_of_the_Earth "Figure of the Earth"), if the two points have horizontal distance _x_ 1 and _x_ 2 from a fixed point, the run is (_x_ 2 − _x_ 1) = Δ _x_. The slope between the two points is the **difference ratio**:

![Image 3: {\displaystyle m={\frac {\Delta y}{\Delta x}}={\frac {y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bb86068f5f3d47b01a0face3182fb6bff72f68d0)
Through [trigonometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometry "Trigonometry"), the slope _m_ of a line is related to its [angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle "Angle") of inclination _θ_ by the [tangent function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_function "Tangent function")

![Image 4: {\displaystyle m=\tan(\theta ).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d8f7b32a590071b56cd36c4b5fe7f32e8f75978e)
Thus, a 45° rising line has slope _m =_ +1, and a 45° falling line has slope _m =_ −1.

Generalizing this, [differential calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_calculus "Differential calculus") defines the slope of a [plane curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_curve "Plane curve") at a point as the slope of its [tangent line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent "Tangent") at that point. When the curve is approximated by a series of points, the slope of the curve may be approximated by the slope of the [secant line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secant_line "Secant line") between two nearby points. When the curve is given as the graph of an [algebraic expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_expression "Algebraic expression"), calculus gives [formulas for the slope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative "Derivative") at each point. Slope is thus one of the central ideas of calculus and its applications to design.

There seems to be no clear answer as to why the letter _m_ is used for slope, but it first appears in English in [O'Brien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_O%27Brien_(mathematician) "Matthew O'Brien (mathematician)") (1844)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slope#cite_note-2) who introduced the equation of a line as "_y_ = _mx_ + _b_", and it can also be found in [Todhunter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Todhunter "Isaac Todhunter") (1888)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slope#cite_note-3) who wrote "_y_ = _mx_ + _c_".[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slope#cite_note-4)

Slope of a line in coordinates system, from _f_(_x_) = −12 _x_ + 2 to _f_(_x_) = 12 _x_ + 2

The slope of a line in the plane containing the _x_ and _y_ axes is generally represented by the letter _m_,[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slope#cite_note-5) and is defined as the change in the _y_ coordinate divided by the corresponding change in the _x_ coordinate, between two distinct points on the line. This is described by the following equation:

![Image 7: {\displaystyle m={\frac {\Delta y}{\Delta x}}={\frac {{\text{vertical}}\,{\text{change}}}{{\text{horizontal}}\,{\text{change}}}}={\frac {\text{rise}}{\text{run}}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/addc6085e3d07da9a6fc0b4311095db03ebaa74e)
(The Greek letter _[delta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta\_(letter) "Delta (letter)")_, Δ, is commonly used in mathematics to mean "difference" or "change".)

Given two points ![Image 8: {\displaystyle (x_{1},y_{1})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7fc74086e56542bd28b46a84faaee3cebdd4a899) and ![Image 9: {\displaystyle (x_{2},y_{2})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d52d44e16a796acee486af49af05f678566d181a), the change in ![Image 10: {\displaystyle x}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/87f9e315fd7e2ba406057a97300593c4802b53e4) from one to the other is ![Image 11: {\displaystyle x_{2}-x_{1}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bf4533d7a48189633a07785ff3fac0dcc852d515) (_run_), while the change in ![Image 12: {\displaystyle y}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b8a6208ec717213d4317e666f1ae872e00620a0d) is ![Image 13: {\displaystyle y_{2}-y_{1}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/172550f94371f0e63473266a49766c04df02e309) (_rise_). Substituting both quantities into the above equation generates the formula:

![Image 14: {\displaystyle m={\frac {y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/72263d5113a7cc985f29fc9fc4b3f5e85dd5bbe5)
The formula fails for a vertical line, parallel to the ![Image 15: {\displaystyle y}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b8a6208ec717213d4317e666f1ae872e00620a0d) axis (see [Division by zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_by_zero "Division by zero")), where the slope can be taken as [infinite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity "Infinity"), so the slope of a vertical line is considered undefined.

Suppose a line runs through two points: _P_=(1,2) and _Q_=(13,8). By dividing the difference in ![Image 16: {\displaystyle y}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b8a6208ec717213d4317e666f1ae872e00620a0d)-coordinates by the difference in ![Image 17: {\displaystyle x}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/87f9e315fd7e2ba406057a97300593c4802b53e4)-coordinates, one can obtain the slope of the line:

![Image 18: {\displaystyle m={\frac {\Delta y}{\Delta x}}={\frac {y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}}={\frac {(8-2)}{(13-1)}}={\frac {6}{12}}={\frac {1}{2}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d5afc54d2730fbe906f1926981074f3e06f4c285)Since the slope is positive, the direction of the line is increasing. Since |_m_| < 1, the incline is not very steep (incline < 45°).
As another example, consider a line which runs through the points (4,15) and (3,21). Then, the slope of the line is

![Image 19: {\displaystyle m={\frac {21-15}{3-4}}={\frac {6}{-1}}=-6.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/69cef55373bce032897a822809760033130b958f)Since the slope is negative, the direction of the line is decreasing. Since |_m_| > 1, this decline is fairly steep (decline > 45°).

Slopes of parallel and perpendicular lines

For example, consider a line running through points (2,8) and (3,20). This line has a slope, _m_, of

![Image 21: {\displaystyle {\frac {(20-8)}{(3-2)}}=12.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2feb369cb521542408ae5879c3ae96b9c94a0f6f)
One can then write the line's equation, in point-slope form:

![Image 22: {\displaystyle y-8=12(x-2)=12x-24.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fdba3ca88d4ebb97c1ea496ba5db017419b48dce)

The angle θ between −90° and 90° that this line makes with the _x_-axis is

Consider the two lines: _y_ = −3 _x_ + 1 and _y_ = −3 _x_ − 2. Both lines have slope _m_ = −3. They are not the same line. So they are parallel lines.

Consider the two lines _y_ = −3 _x_ + 1 and _y_ = ⁠_x_/3⁠ − 2. The slope of the first line is _m_ 1 = −3. The slope of the second line is _m_ 2 = ⁠1/3⁠. The product of these two slopes is −1. So these two lines are perpendicular.

This may also be written as a ratio of [covariances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance "Covariance"):[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slope#cite_note-6)

At each point, the [derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative "Derivative") is the slope of a [line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_(geometry) "Line (geometry)") that is [tangent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent "Tangent") to the [curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve "Curve") at that point. Note: the derivative at point A is [positive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_number "Positive number") where green and dash–dot, [negative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_number "Negative number") where red and dashed, and [zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_(number) "Zero (number)") where black and solid.

The concept of a slope is central to [differential calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_calculus "Differential calculus"). For non-linear functions, the rate of change varies along the curve. The [derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative "Derivative") of the function at a point is the slope of the line [tangent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent "Tangent") to the curve at the point and is thus equal to the rate of change of the function at that point.

If we let Δ _x_ and Δ _y_ be the distances (along the _x_ and _y_ axes, respectively) between two points on a curve, then the slope given by the above definition,

![Image 32: {\displaystyle m={\frac {\Delta y}{\Delta x}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5a20d2a034e0b9063b50df5ce9876dd5b9734162),
is the slope of a [secant line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secant_line "Secant line") to the curve. For a line, the secant between any two points is the line itself, but this is not the case for any other type of curve.

For example, the slope of the secant intersecting _y_ = _x_ 2 at (0,0) and (3,9) is 3. (The slope of the tangent at _x_ = 3⁄2 is also 3−_a_ consequence of the [mean value theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_value_theorem "Mean value theorem").)

By moving the two points closer together so that Δ _y_ and Δ _x_ decrease, the secant line more closely approximates a tangent line to the curve, and as such the slope of the secant approaches that of the tangent. Using [differential calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_calculus "Differential calculus"), we can determine the [limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_of_a_function "Limit of a function"), or the value that Δ _y_/Δ _x_ approaches as Δ _y_ and Δ _x_ get closer to [zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero "Zero"); it follows that this limit is the exact slope of the tangent. If _y_ is dependent on _x_, then it is sufficient to take the limit where only Δ _x_ approaches zero. Therefore, the slope of the tangent is the limit of Δ _y_/Δ _x_ as Δ _x_ approaches zero, or d _y_/d _x_. We call this limit the [derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_(calculus) "Derivative (calculus)").

![Image 33: {\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} y}{\mathrm {d} x}}=\lim _{\Delta x\to 0}{\frac {\Delta y}{\Delta x}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5acd8221e8accfd75cb6304f98a66bcfee1f518d)
The value of the derivative at a specific point on the function provides us with the slope of the tangent at that precise location. For example, let _y_ = _x_ 2. A point on this function is (−2,4). The derivative of this function is d _y_⁄d _x_ = 2 _x_. So the slope of the line tangent to _y_ at (−2,4) is 2 ⋅ (−2) = −4. The equation of this tangent line is: _y_ − 4 = (−4)(_x_ − (−2)) or _y_ = −4 _x_ − 4.

Difference of slopes
--------------------

The illusion of a paradox of area is dispelled by comparing slopes where blue and red triangles meet.

An extension of the idea of angle follows from the difference of slopes. Consider the [shear mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shear_mapping "Shear mapping")

![Image 35: {\displaystyle (u,v)=(x,y){\begin{pmatrix}1&v\\0&1\end{pmatrix}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8493e8d43727cf947a6aa8680aed40b2a1140570)

For two points on ![Image 42: {\displaystyle \{(1,y):y\in \mathbb {R} \}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/10437ae95a8897de43d9c31c51f8e28284c9bb57) with slopes ![Image 43: {\displaystyle m}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0a07d98bb302f3856cbabc47b2b9016692e3f7bc) and ![Image 44: {\displaystyle n}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b), the image

This invariance of slope differences makes slope an angular [invariant measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariant_measure "Invariant measure"), on a par with circular angle (invariant under rotation) and hyperbolic angle, with invariance group of [squeeze mappings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squeeze_mapping "Squeeze mapping").[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slope#cite_note-7)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slope#cite_note-8)

Slope (pitch) of a roof
-----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Slope&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Slope (pitch) of a roof")]

The slope of a roof, traditionally and commonly called the [roof pitch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roof_pitch "Roof pitch"), in carpentry and architecture in the US is commonly described in terms of integer fractions of one foot (geometric tangent, rise over run), a legacy of British imperial measure. Other units are in use in other locales, with similar conventions. For details, see [roof pitch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roof_pitch "Roof pitch").

Slope of a road or railway
--------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Slope&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Slope of a road or railway")]

There are two common ways to describe the steepness of a [road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road "Road") or [railroad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_tracks "Rail tracks"). One is by the angle between 0° and 90° (in degrees), and the other is by the slope in a percentage. See also [steep grade railway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steep_grade_railway "Steep grade railway") and [rack railway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rack_railway "Rack railway").

The formulae for converting a slope given as a percentage into an angle in degrees and vice versa are:

![Image 48: {\displaystyle {\text{angle}}=\arctan \left({\frac {\text{slope}}{100\%}}\right)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/83cdbb8efc8a1a4907bda9c8c38a698e9572660b) (this is the inverse function of tangent; see [trigonometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometry "Trigonometry"))
and

![Image 49: {\displaystyle {\mbox{slope}}=100\%\times \tan({\mbox{angle}}),}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e1d7358a713937f07df143c8947c9ac4512409d4)
where _angle_ is in degrees and the trigonometric functions operate in degrees. For example, a slope of 100[%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent_sign "Percent sign") or 1000[‰](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Per_mil "Per mil") is an angle of 45°.

A third way is to give one unit of rise in say 10, 20, 50 or 100 horizontal units, e.g. 1:10. 1:20, 1:50 or 1:100 (or "1 _in_ 10", "1 _in_ 20", etc.) 1:10 is steeper than 1:20. For example, steepness of 20% means 1:5 or an incline with angle 11.3°.

Roads and railways have both longitudinal slopes and cross slopes.
