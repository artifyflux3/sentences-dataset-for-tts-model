Its design is unusual in that it consists of two separate playing and seating areas, one intended for basketball and one intended for ice hockey , joined together within a common facility. It seats 3,570 for basketball and 3,386 for hockey. Officially, the hockey side is known as the Frank Perrotti, Jr. Arena.

The center opened on January 27, 2007, and is home to the Quinnipiac University men’s and women’s basketball and men’s and women’s ice hockey teams.  It replaced Burt Kahn Court for the basketball team and the Northford Ice Pavilion for ice hockey.  It is located on Quinnipiac's York Hill Campus and is part of a large expansion project for that campus.

[ 5 ] The center cost $52 million to build.

[ 5 ] Its creation is part of an ambitious plan by Quinnipiac to improve its drawing power for student athletes.
