[ 7 ] [ 8 ] History [ edit ] Founding [ edit ] On March 21, 1906, Governor J. C. W. Beckham signed legislation which established the Eastern Kentucky State Normal School No. 1 .

[ 9 ] On May 7, 1906, the Normal School Commission selected the site of the former Central University campus as the location of this new college; EKU remains at this location today.

Renaming [ edit ] In 1922, the Eastern Kentucky State Normal School No. 1 changed its name to Eastern Kentucky State Normal School and Teachers College, and the transformed college awarded its first degrees under that name in 1925. In 1930, the college changed its name again, becoming the Eastern Kentucky State Teachers College. In 1948, the General Assembly shortened it to Eastern Kentucky State College. In 1966, it was officially renamed Eastern Kentucky University.

[ citation needed ] Campus revitalization [ edit ] The years between 2012 and 2020 were marked by a building campaign that altered the campus layout and improved aesthetics. Funding for the multimillion-dollar project relied heavily on public-private partnerships (P3) under the leadership of then-President Michael T. Benson . The construction efforts mark the most significant period of campus facility development since President Robert R. Martin's tenure in the 1960s.
