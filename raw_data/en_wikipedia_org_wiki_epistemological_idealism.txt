It is opposed to epistemological realism .

Overview [ edit ] Epistemological idealism suggests that everything we experience and know is of a mental nature— sense data in philosophical jargon. Although it is sometimes employed to argue in favor of metaphysical idealism , in principle epistemological idealism makes no claim about whether sense data are grounded in reality. As such, it is a container for both indirect realism and idealism . This is the version of epistemological idealism which interested Ludwig Boltzmann ; it had roots in the positivism of Ernst Mach and Gustav Kirchhoff plus a number of aspects of the Kantianism or neo-Kantianism of Hermann von Helmholtz and Heinrich Hertz .

[ 1 ] A contemporary representative of epistemological idealism is Brand Blanshard .
