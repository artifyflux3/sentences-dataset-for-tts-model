This can include a political crisis such as  a coup d'etat , or mass civil disorder , due to political and/or social disorder, due to military conflict, or  mass protests, or dysfunction within any part of or the central body of government.

an economic crisis which can range from or include a possible financial crisis , currency crisis , or any economic shock, or any breakdown or major dysfunctions within the economic system, or a major upheaval due to a natural disaster , which can include severe weather, or epidemics, or drought, or famine, or other events related to the natural world.
