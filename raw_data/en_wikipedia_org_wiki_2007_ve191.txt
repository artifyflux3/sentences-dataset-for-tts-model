[ 3 ] Description [ edit ] It is estimated to be roughly 63 meters in diameter. In 2015 it was known to have a 1 in 63,000 chance of impacting Earth on 27 November 2015.

[ 3 ] However, the nominal best-fit orbit showed that 2007 VE 191 would be roughly 0.5 AU (75,000,000 km ; 46,000,000 mi ) from Earth on 27 November 2015 with an apparent magnitude of roughly +25 in the constellation of Virgo about 50 degrees from the Sun, [ 5 ] and the same nominal orbit gave a distance of closest approach to Earth of a little under 0.4 AU a few weeks earlier. It was removed from the Sentry Risk Table on 17 September 2015, [ 6 ] but was still listed at NEODyS with odds of 1 in 3 million for 27 November 2015 during the approach window.

[ 7 ] 2007 VE 191 was discovered on 15 November 2007 by the Mount Lemmon Survey at an apparent magnitude of 20 using a 1.5-meter (59 in) reflecting telescope .

[ 1 ] On 28 November 2007, it passed 0.0128 AU (1,910,000 km ; 1,190,000 mi ) from Earth.

[ 8 ] 2007 VE 191 has an observation arc of 13 days with an uncertainty parameter of 7, which means its orbit is poorly constrained.

[ 2 ] 2007 VE 191 was last observed on 28 November 2007.

[ 2 ] By 1 December 2007, the asteroid had faded to below magnitude 25.

[ 9 ] With an absolute magnitude of 23.6, [ 2 ] 2007 VE 191 is about 50–110 meters in diameter.
