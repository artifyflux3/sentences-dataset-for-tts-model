Find sources: "Corporate capitalism" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( January 2025 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) In the developed world , corporations dominate the marketplace, comprising 50% [ citation needed ] or more of all businesses. Those businesses which are not corporations contain the same bureaucratic structure of corporations, but there is usually a sole owner or group of owners who are liable to bankruptcy and criminal charges relating to their business. Corporations have limited liability .

[ citation needed ] Corporations are usually called public entities or publicly traded entities when parts of their business can be bought in the form of shares on the stock market . This is done as a way of raising capital to finance the investments of the corporation. The shareholders appoint the executives of the corporation, who are the ones running the corporation via a hierarchical chain of power, where the bulk of investor decisions are made at the top and have effects on those beneath them.

Criticisms [ edit ] Corporate capitalism has been criticized for the amount of power and influence corporations and large business interest groups have over government policy , including the policies of regulatory agencies and influencing political campaigns . Many social scientists have criticized corporations for failing to act in the interests of the people, and their existence seems to circumvent the principles of democracy , which assumes equal power relations between individuals in a society.

[ 1 ] Dwight D. Eisenhower criticized the notion of the confluence of corporate power and de facto fascism, [ 2 ] but nevertheless brought attention to the "conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry" [ 3 ] (the military–industrial complex ) in his 1961 Farewell Address to the Nation , and stressed "the need to maintain balance in and among national programs—balance between the private and the public economy, balance between cost and hoped for advantage".
