Equality is achieved, with the area being ( n + 1 ) n / n !

= 9 / 2 {\displaystyle (n+1)^{n}/n!=9/2} In the geometry of numbers , Ehrhart's volume conjecture gives an upper bound on the volume of a convex body containing only one lattice point in its interior.  It is a kind of converse to Minkowski's theorem , which guarantees that a centrally symmetric convex body K must contain a lattice point as soon as its volume exceeds 2 n {\displaystyle 2^{n}} .  The conjecture states that a convex body K containing only one lattice point in its interior as its barycenter cannot have volume greater than ( n + 1 ) n / n !

{\displaystyle (n+1)^{n}/n!} : Vol ⁡ ⁡ ( K ) ≤ ≤ ( n + 1 ) n n !

.

{\displaystyle \operatorname {Vol} (K)\leq {\frac {(n+1)^{n}}{n!}}.} Equality is achieved in this inequality when K = ( n + 1 ) Δ Δ n {\displaystyle K=(n+1)\Delta _{n}} is a copy of the standard simplex in Euclidean n -dimensional space, whose sides are scaled up by a factor of n + 1 {\displaystyle n+1} .  Equivalently, K = ( n + 1 ) Δ Δ n {\displaystyle K=(n+1)\Delta _{n}} is congruent to the convex hull of the vectors − − ∑ ∑ i = 1 n e i {\displaystyle -\sum _{i=1}^{n}\mathbf {e} _{i}} , and ( n + 1 ) e j − − ∑ ∑ i = 1 n e i {\displaystyle (n+1)\mathbf {e} _{j}-\sum _{i=1}^{n}\mathbf {e} _{i}} for all j = 1 , … … , n {\displaystyle j=1,\ldots ,n} .  Presented in this manner, the origin is the only lattice point interior to the convex body K .

The conjecture, furthermore, asserts that equality is achieved in the above inequality if and only if K is unimodularly equivalent to ( n + 1 ) Δ Δ n {\displaystyle (n+1)\Delta _{n}} .

Ehrhart proved the conjecture in dimension 2 and in the case of simplices.
