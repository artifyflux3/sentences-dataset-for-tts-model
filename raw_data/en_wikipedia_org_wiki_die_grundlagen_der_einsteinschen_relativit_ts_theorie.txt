It premiered on 2 April 1922 at the Frankfurt Fair .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] With more than 80,000 individual images, it is not only the first great science film, it is also the film with the longest trick sequences. The film's running time was between two and three hours, depending on the length of the commentaries made by the scientific presenter. While the  original version of the film is lost, part of the film (around 20 minutes) was used to create Max Fleischer 's film The Einstein Theory of Relativity from 1923.
