The xyston ( Ancient Greek : ξυστόν " spear , javelin ; pointed or spiked stick, goad), was a type of a long thrusting spear in ancient Greece . It measured about 3.5 to 4.25 m (11 to 14 ft) long and was probably held by the cavalryman with both hands. It had a wooden shaft and a spear-point at both ends. Possible reasons for the secondary spear-tip were that it acted partly as a counterweight and also served as a backup in case the xyston was broken in action. The xyston is usually mentioned in context with the hetairoi ( ἑταῖροι ), the cavalry forces of ancient Macedon . After Alexander the Great's death, the hetairoi were named xystophoroi ( ξυστοφόροι , "spear-bearers") because of their use of the xyston lance . In his Greek-written Bellum Judaicum , the Jewish historian Flavius Josephus uses the term xyston to describe the Roman throwing javelin, the pilum .

The xyston was wielded either underarm or overarm, presumably as a matter of personal preference. It was also known, especially later, as the kontos ; meaning literally "barge-pole"; the name possibly originated as a slang term for the weapon.

It is made of cornel wood.

[ 1 ] The recorded density is 51.5 lbs per cubic foot (825 kg/m 3 ), or 0.03 lb per cubic inch (0.83 g/cm 3 ).

[ 1 ] Cornus mas wood Cornus mas , also known as the Cornelian cherry, is common in the wood mountains that surround Macedonia, ranging from areas in the Balkans and into Syria; some specific locations are Mt. Olympus , Phthiotis, Aetolia, Arcadia , Laconis.

[ 1 ] This cornel wood was used for the spear, because of its elasticity and hardness, making it very durable and a good material for spears, javelins, and bows .

[ 1 ] The cornel wood was effective compared to other woods, for uses such as these.

[ 1 ] The wood, despite being used for a spear that was so long, was able to withstand the weight of itself; it was tough enough to not need thickness to balance the weight of its length, while still maintaining its elasticity.
