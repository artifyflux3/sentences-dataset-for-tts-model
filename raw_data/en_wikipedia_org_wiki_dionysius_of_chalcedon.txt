320 BC) [ 1 ] was a Greek philosopher and dialectician connected with the Megarian school . He was a native of Chalcedon on the coast of Bithynia .

[ 2 ] Dionysius was the person who first used the name Dialecticians to describe a splinter group within the Megarian school "because they put their arguments into the form of question and answer".

[ 3 ] One area of activity for the dialecticians was the framing of definitions , [ 4 ] and Aristotle criticises a definition of life by Dionysius in his Topics : [ 5 ] This is, moreover, what happens to Dionysius' definition of "life" when stated as "a movement of a creature sustained by nutriment, congenitally present with it" Dionysius is also reported to have taught Theodorus the Atheist .
