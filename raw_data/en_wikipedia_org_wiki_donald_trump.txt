United States New York felony conviction for falsifying business records Stormy Daniels scandal New York investigations Georgia election indictment Georgia election investigation mug shot v t e Donald John Trump (born June 14, 1946) is an American politician, media personality, and businessman who is the 47th president of the United States . A member of the Republican Party , he served as the 45th president from 2017 to 2021.

Born into a wealthy family in New York City, Trump graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968 with a bachelor's degree in economics. He became the president of his family's real estate business in 1971, renamed it the Trump Organization , and began acquiring and building skyscrapers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses. He launched side ventures, many licensing the Trump name, and filed for six business bankruptcies in the 1990s and 2000s. From 2004 to 2015, he hosted the reality television show The Apprentice , bolstering his fame as a billionaire. Presenting himself as a political outsider, Trump won the 2016 presidential election against Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton .

During his first presidency, Trump imposed a travel ban on seven Muslim-majority countries, expanded the Mexico–United States border wall , and enforced a family separation policy on the border. He rolled back environmental and business regulations, signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act , and appointed three Supreme Court justices. In foreign policy, Trump withdrew the U.S. from agreements on climate, trade, and Iran's nuclear program, and initiated a trade war with China . In response to the COVID-19 pandemic from 2020, he downplayed its severity, contradicted health officials, and signed the CARES Act .  After losing the 2020 presidential election to Joe Biden , Trump attempted to overturn the result , culminating in the January 6 Capitol attack in 2021. He was impeached in 2019 for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, and in 2021 for incitement of insurrection; the Senate acquitted him both times.

In 2023, Trump was found liable in civil cases for sexual abuse and defamation and for business fraud . He was found guilty of falsifying business records in 2024, making him the first U.S. president convicted of a felony. After winning the 2024 presidential election against Kamala Harris , he was sentenced to a penalty-free discharge , and two felony indictments against him for retention of classified documents and obstruction of the 2020 election were dismissed without prejudice.

A racketeering case related to the 2020 election in Georgia is pending.

Trump began his second presidency by initiating mass layoffs of federal workers . He imposed tariffs on nearly all countries at the highest level since the Great Depression and signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act . His administration's actions—including intimidation of political opponents and civil society , deportations of immigrants, and extensive use of executive orders—have drawn over 300 lawsuits challenging their legality . High-profile cases have underscored his broad interpretation of the unitary executive theory and have led to significant conflicts with the federal courts. In 2025, he authorized airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites .

Since 2015, Trump's leadership style and political agenda—often referred to as Trumpism —have reshaped the Republican Party's identity. Many of his comments and actions have been characterized as racist or misogynistic,  and he has made false or misleading statements and promoted conspiracy theories to an extent unprecedented in American politics. Trump's actions, especially in his second term, have been described as authoritarian and contributing to democratic backsliding . After his first term, scholars and historians ranked him as one of the worst presidents in American history.

Early life and education At New York Military Academy , 1964 Donald John Trump was born on June 14, 1946, at Jamaica Hospital in the New York City borough of Queens , the fourth child of Fred Trump and Mary Anne MacLeod Trump .

[ 1 ] He is of German and Scottish descent.

[ 2 ] He grew up with his older siblings, Maryanne , Fred Jr.

, and Elizabeth, and his younger brother, Robert , in a mansion in the Jamaica Estates neighborhood of Queens.

[ 3 ] Fred Trump paid his children each about $20,000 a year, equivalent to $265,000 a year in 2024. Trump was a millionaire in inflation-adjusted dollars by age eight.

[ 4 ] [ a ] Trump attended the private Kew-Forest School through seventh grade. He was a difficult child and showed an early interest in his father's business. His father enrolled him in New York Military Academy , a private boarding school, to complete secondary school.

[ 5 ] The academy pushed students into sports [ 6 ] and drilled the imperative of winning .

[ 7 ] Trump played a year of varsity football and soccer, and three years of baseball.

[ 6 ] In baseball, he emerged as a cocaptain, [ 6 ] cleanup batter, and excellent first baseman [ 8 ] —even so, he exaggerated his athletic prowess.

[ 9 ] [ b ] In high school his grades improved to a B average.

[ 11 ] [ c ] Trump considered a show business career but instead, to be closer to home, enrolled at Fordham University in 1964.

[ 13 ] He dropped ROTC officer training after one year, [ 14 ] and played indifferent football, squash, and tennis.

[ 15 ] His Fordham friends introduced him to golf.

[ 16 ] His junior year he transferred to the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania , most often commuting to his father's office on weekends, and graduating in May 1968 with a Bachelor of Science in economics.

[ 17 ] [ 18 ] In college [ 19 ] he was not the top student he sometimes claimed to be.

[ 20 ] By the time he went to Wharton—where he does not appear in a list of those receiving honors [ d ] —he was eyeing a career in real estate.

[ 19 ] He was exempted from the draft during the Vietnam War due to a claim of bone spurs in his heels.

[ 21 ] Notwithstanding five years in military school, [ 19 ] he had no interest in going to war.

[ 21 ] Growing up, he considered his father and the family's pastor, Norman Vincent Peale , [ 22 ] to be his mentors.

[ 23 ] His father told him repeatedly that he was "a king" and to be "a killer".

[ 24 ] Peale preached self-confidence as the impetus for prosperity.

[ 25 ] [ e ] Business career Main articles: Business career of Donald Trump and The Trump Organization Further information: Business projects of Donald Trump in Russia and Tax returns of Donald Trump Real estate Starting in 1968, Trump was employed at Trump Management, his father's real estate company, [ 27 ] which managed the middle-class apartment complexes Fred had built in Queens , Staten Island , and Brooklyn .

[ 28 ] His main tasks were collecting rent and making repairs [ 29 ] for about five years.

[ 30 ] Captivated by its glamor and riches, [ 31 ] Trump asked his father to expand to Manhattan where prices were at least three orders of magnitude higher, but his father was content in the outer boroughs.

[ 30 ] In 1971, he moved to Manhattan where he planned to move the business [ 32 ] and commuted to his father's office.

[ 33 ] That year, his father made himself chairman and Trump president, overseeing 48 private corporations and 15 family partnerships.

[ 19 ] Trump renamed the disparate businesses to a single umbrella, the Trump Organization .

[ 34 ] Roy Cohn , Trump's most important early influence after his father, [ 35 ] was his fixer , lawyer, and mentor [ 36 ] for 13 years in the 1970s and 1980s.

[ 37 ] Cohn taught Trump to think that life is transactional.

[ 38 ] In 1973, Cohn helped Trump countersue the U.S. government for $100 million (equivalent to $708 million in 2024 [ 39 ] ) over its charges that Trump's properties had discriminated against Black applicants and tenants. Trump's counterclaims were dismissed, and the government's case was settled with the Trumps signing a consent decree agreeing to desegregate. Four years later, the Trumps again faced the courts when they were found in contempt of the decree.

[ 40 ] Helping Trump projects, [ 41 ] Cohn was a consigliere whose Mafia connections controlled construction unions.

[ 42 ] In 1979, Cohn introduced political consultant Roger Stone to Trump, who enlisted Stone's services to deal with the federal government.

[ 43 ] Trump moved from his studio to a penthouse with a view and got a real estate broker's license in the mid-1970s.

[ 44 ] Before age thirty, he showed his propensity for litigation, no matter the outcome and cost; even when he lost, he described the case as a win.

[ 45 ] Over three decades as of 2018, Trump had been involved in more than 4,000 lawsuits, [ 46 ] liens, and other filings, often filed for nonpayment against him by employees, contractors, real estate brokers, and his own attorneys.

[ 47 ] Between 1991 and 2009, Trump filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for six of his businesses: the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan, the casinos in Atlantic City, New Jersey , and the Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts company.

[ 48 ] [ 49 ] In 1992, Trump, his siblings Maryanne, Elizabeth, and Robert, and his cousin John W. Walter formed All County Building Supply & Maintenance Corp, each with a 20 percent share. The company had no offices and is alleged to have been a shell company for paying the vendors providing services and supplies for Trump's rental units, then billing those services and supplies to Trump Management with markups of 20–50 percent and more. The owners shared the proceeds generated by the markups. The increased costs were used to get state approval for increasing the rents of his rent-stabilized units. In January 1994, the siblings formed Apartment Management Associates and took over the management fees formerly collected by Trump Management. As well as inflating rents, the schemes served to transfer assets from Fred Trump to his children and nephew and lower the tax burden.

[ 50 ] Manhattan and Chicago developments In 1985 with a model of one of his aborted Manhattan development projects [ 51 ] Trump attracted public attention in 1978 with the launch of his family's first Manhattan venture: the renovation of the derelict Commodore Hotel , adjacent to Grand Central Terminal.

[ 52 ] The financing was facilitated by a $400 million city property tax abatement arranged for him by his father who also, jointly with Hyatt , guaranteed a $70 million bank construction loan.

[ 53 ] [ 54 ] The hotel reopened in 1980 as the Grand Hyatt Hotel , [ 55 ] and that same year, he obtained rights to develop Trump Tower , a mixed-use skyscraper in Midtown Manhattan.

[ 56 ] The building houses the headquarters of the Trump Corporation and Trump's PAC and was his primary residence until 2019.

[ 57 ] In 1988, Trump acquired the Plaza Hotel with a loan from a consortium of 16 banks.

[ 58 ] The hotel filed for bankruptcy protection in 1992, and a reorganization plan was approved a month later, with the banks taking control of the property.

[ 59 ] In 1995, Trump defaulted on over $3 billion of bank loans, and the lenders seized the Plaza Hotel along with most of his other properties in a "vast and humiliating restructuring" that allowed him to avoid personal bankruptcy.

[ 60 ] [ 61 ] The lead bank's attorney said of the banks' decision that they "all agreed that he'd be better alive than dead".

[ 60 ] In 1996, Trump acquired and renovated the mostly vacant 71-story skyscraper at 40 Wall Street , later rebranded as the Trump Building.

[ 62 ] In the early 1990s, he won the right to develop a 70-acre (28 ha) tract in the Lincoln Square neighborhood near the Hudson River. Struggling with debt from other ventures in 1994, he sold most of his interest in the project to Asian investors, who financed the project's completion, Riverside South .

[ 63 ] Trump's last major construction project was the 92-story mixed-use Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago, which opened in 2008. In 2024, The New York Times and ProPublica reported that the Internal Revenue Service was investigating whether he had twice written off losses incurred through construction cost overruns and lagging sales of residential units in the building he had declared to be worthless on his 2008 tax return.

[ 64 ] Atlantic City casinos Entrance of the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City In 1984, Trump opened Harrah's at Trump Plaza , a hotel and casino, with financing and management help from the Holiday Corporation .

[ 65 ] It was unprofitable, and he paid Holiday $70 million in May 1986 to take sole control.

[ 66 ] In 1985, he bought the unopened Atlantic City Hilton Hotel and renamed it Trump Castle .

[ 67 ] Both casinos filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1992.

[ 68 ] Trump bought a third Atlantic City venue in 1988, the Trump Taj Mahal . It was financed with $675 million in junk bonds and completed for $1.1 billion, opening in April 1990.

[ 65 ] He filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1991. Under the provisions of the restructuring agreement, he gave up half his initial stake and personally guaranteed future performance.

[ 69 ] To reduce his $900 million of personal debt, he sold the Trump Shuttle airline; his megayacht, the Trump Princess , which had been leased to his casinos and kept docked; and other businesses.

[ 70 ] In 1995, Trump founded Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts (THCR), which assumed ownership of the Trump Plaza.

[ 71 ] THCR purchased the Taj Mahal and the Trump Castle in 1996 and went bankrupt in 2004 and 2009, leaving him with 10 percent ownership.

[ 65 ] He remained chairman until 2009.

[ 72 ] Golf clubs In 1985, Trump acquired the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida.

[ 73 ] In 1995, he converted the estate into a private club with an initiation fee and annual dues. He continued to use a wing of the house as a private residence.

[ 74 ] He declared the club his primary residence in 2019.

[ 57 ] He began building and buying golf courses in 1999, owning 17 golf courses by 2016.

[ 75 ] Licensing the Trump name See also: List of things named after Donald Trump The Trump Organization often licensed the Trump name for consumer products and services, including foodstuffs, apparel, learning courses, and home furnishings.

[ 76 ] Over 50 licensing or management deals involved Trump's name, generating at least $59 million for his companies.

[ 77 ] By 2018, only two consumer goods companies continued to license his name.

[ 76 ] During the 2000s, Trump licensed his name to residential property developments worldwide, 40 of which were never built.

[ 78 ] Side ventures See also: Donald Trump and American football 1985 New Jersey Generals press conference in Trump Tower In 1970, Trump invested $70,000 of his father's wealth to receive billing as coproducer of a Broadway comedy—and lost the money.

[ 79 ] After making low-ball bids for the New York Mets and the Cleveland Indians baseball teams, in 1983 for about $6 million, he purchased the New Jersey Generals , a team in the United States Football League .

[ 80 ] The league folded after the 1985 season, largely due to his attempt to move to a fall schedule (when it would have competed with the National Football League [NFL] for audience) and his attempt to force a merger with the NFL by bringing an antitrust suit.

[ 81 ] Trump and his Plaza Hotel hosted several boxing matches at the Atlantic City Convention Hall .

[ 65 ] [ 82 ] In 1989 and 1990, he lent his name to the Tour de Trump cycling stage race, an attempt to create an American equivalent of European races such as the Tour de France or the Giro d'Italia .

[ 83 ] From 1986 to 1988, he purchased significant blocks of shares in various public companies while suggesting that he intended to take over the company and then sold his shares for a profit, [ 84 ] leading some observers to think he was engaged in greenmail .

[ 85 ] The New York Times found that he initially made millions of dollars in such stock transactions, but "lost most, if not all, of those gains after investors stopped taking his takeover talk seriously".

[ 84 ] Trump's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame In 1988, Trump purchased the Eastern Air Lines Shuttle , financing the purchase with $380 million (equivalent to $1.01 billion in 2024 [ 39 ] ) in loans from a syndicate of 22 banks. He renamed the airline Trump Shuttle and operated it until 1992.

[ 86 ] He defaulted on his loans in 1991, and ownership passed to the banks.

[ 87 ] In 1996, he purchased the Miss Universe pageants, including Miss USA and Miss Teen USA .

[ 88 ] Due to disagreements with CBS about scheduling, he took both pageants to NBC in 2002.

[ 89 ] [ 90 ] In 2007, he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his work as producer of Miss Universe.

[ 91 ] NBC and Univision dropped the pageants in June 2015 in reaction to his comments about Mexican immigrants.

[ 92 ] In 2005, Trump cofounded Trump University , a company that sold real estate seminars for up to $35,000. After New York State authorities notified the company that its use of "university" violated state law (as it was not an academic institution), its name was changed to the Trump Entrepreneur Initiative in 2010.

[ 93 ] In 2013, the State of New York filed a $40 million civil suit against Trump University, alleging that the company made false statements and defrauded consumers. Additionally, two class actions were filed in federal court against Trump and his companies. Internal documents revealed that employees were instructed to use a hard-sell approach, and former employees testified that Trump University had defrauded or lied to its students.

[ 94 ] Shortly after he won the 2016 presidential election, he agreed to pay a total of $25 million to settle the three cases.

[ 95 ] Foundation Main article: Donald J. Trump Foundation The Donald J. Trump Foundation was a private foundation established in 1988.

[ 96 ] From 1987 to 2006, Trump gave his foundation $5.4 million, which had been spent by the end of 2006. After donating a total of $65,000 in 2007–2008, he stopped donating any personal funds to the charity, [ 97 ] which received millions from other donors, including $5 million from Vince McMahon .

[ 98 ] The foundation gave to health- and sports-related charities, conservative groups, [ 99 ] and charities that held events at Trump properties.

[ 97 ] In 2016, The Washington Post reported that the charity had committed several potential legal and ethical violations, including self-dealing and tax evasion .

[ 100 ] Also in 2016, the New York attorney general stated the foundation had violated state law by soliciting donations without submitting to required annual external audits and ordered it to cease its fundraising activities in New York immediately.

[ 101 ] Trump's team announced in December 2016 that the foundation would be dissolved.

[ 102 ] In June 2018, the New York attorney general's office filed a civil suit against the foundation, Trump, and his adult children, seeking $2.8 million in restitution and additional penalties.

[ 103 ] In December 2018, the foundation ceased operation and disbursed its assets to other charities.

[ 104 ] In November 2019, a New York state judge ordered Trump to pay $2 million to a group of charities for misusing the foundation's funds, in part to finance his presidential campaign.

[ 105 ] Legal affairs and bankruptcies Main article: Personal and business legal affairs of Donald Trump According to a review of state and federal court files conducted by USA Today in 2018, Trump and his businesses had been involved in more than 4,000 state and federal legal actions.

[ 106 ] While he has not filed for personal bankruptcy , his over-leveraged hotel and casino businesses in Atlantic City and New York filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection six times between 1991 and 2009.

[ 49 ] They continued to operate while the banks restructured debt and reduced his shares in the properties.

[ 49 ] During the 1980s, more than 70 banks had lent Trump $4 billion.

[ 285 ] Despite Trump initially blaming Democrats [ 286 ] [ 287 ] and insisting he could not stop the policy with an executive order, he acceded to public pressure in June 2018 and mandated that illegal immigrant families be detained together unless "there is a concern" of risk for the child.

[ 288 ] [ 289 ] A judge later ordered that the families be reunited and further separations stopped except in limited circumstances, [ 290 ] [ 291 ] though over 1,000 additional children were separated from their families after the order.

[ 376 ] Impeachments Main articles: First impeachment of Donald Trump and Second impeachment of Donald Trump Displaying the headline "Trump acquitted" in 2020 Trump was impeached twice by the House of Representatives, though acquitted by the Senate on both occasions.

[ 378 ] In December 2019, the House voted to impeach Trump for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress , [ 379 ] and the Senate acquitted him in February 2020.

[ 385 ] Trump's campaign focused on crime, claiming that cities would descend into lawlessness if Democratic nominee Joe Biden won.

[ 386 ] He repeatedly misrepresented Biden's positions [ 387 ] [ 388 ] and appealed to racism.

[ 389 ] Starting in early 2020, Trump sowed doubts about the election, claiming without evidence that it would be rigged and that widespread use of mail balloting would produce massive election fraud.

[ 390 ] [ 391 ] He blocked funding for the U.S. Postal Service , saying he wanted to prevent any increase in voting by mail.

[ 397 ] The Electoral College formalized Biden's victory on December 14.

[ 397 ] Trump declared victory before the results were known on the morning after the election.

[ 398 ] Days later, when Biden was projected the winner, Trump baselessly alleged election fraud.

[ 399 ] As part of an effort to overturn the results , Trump and his allies filed many legal challenges to the results , which were rejected by at least 86 judges in both state and federal courts for having no factual or legal basis.

[ 400 ] [ 401 ] Trump's allegations were also refuted by state election officials, [ 402 ] and the Supreme Court declined to hear a case asking it to overturn the results in four states won by Biden.

[ 403 ] Trump repeatedly sought help to overturn the results, personally pressuring Republican local and state office-holders, [ 404 ] Republican legislators, [ 405 ] the Justice Department, [ 406 ] and Vice President Pence, [ 407 ] urging actions such as replacing presidential electors , [ 405 ] or that Georgia officials "find" votes and announce a "recalculated" result.

[ 404 ] In the weeks after the election, Trump withdrew from public activities.

[ 408 ] He initially blocked government officials from cooperating in Biden's presidential transition .

[ 409 ] [ 410 ] After three weeks, the administrator of the General Services Administration declared Biden the "apparent winner" of the election, allowing the disbursement of transition resources to his team.

[ 418 ] [ 419 ] A crowd of Trump supporters during the attack At noon on January 6, 2021, while Congress was certifying the presidential election results in the U.S. Capitol , Trump held a rally at the nearby Ellipse . Speaking from behind a glass barrier, [ 420 ] he called for the election to be overturned and urged his supporters to "fight like hell" and "take back our country" by marching to the Capitol.

[ 421 ] His supporters then formed a mob that broke into the building , disrupting certification and causing the evacuation of Congress.

[ 422 ] During the attack, Trump posted on social media but did not ask the rioters to disperse. In a tweet at 6 p.m., he told them to "go home with love & in peace", called them "great patriots", and restated that he had won the election.

[ 423 ] Congress later reconvened and confirmed Biden's victory in the early hours of January 7.

[ 424 ] More than 140 police officers were injured, and five people died during or after the attack.

[ 425 ] [ 426 ] The event has been described as an attempted self-coup by Trump.

[ h ] Between presidencies (2021–2025) Upon leaving the White House, Trump began living at Mar-a-Lago, establishing an office there as provided for by the Former Presidents Act .

[ 430 ] His continuing false claims concerning the 2020 election were commonly referred to as the " big lie " by his critics, although in May 2021, he and many of his supporters began using the term to refer to the election itself.

[ 431 ] [ 432 ] The Republican Party used his false claims about the election to justify imposing new voting restrictions in its favor.

[ 433 ] [ 434 ] [ 435 ] As of July 2022, he continued to pressure state legislators to overturn the election.

[ 436 ] Unlike other former presidents, Trump continued to dominate his party; a 2022 profile in The New York Times described him as a modern party boss .

[ 437 ] He continued fundraising, raising a war chest containing more than twice that of the Republican Party, and profited from fundraisers many Republican candidates held at Mar-a-Lago. Much of his focus was on party governance and installing in key posts officials loyal to him.

[ 437 ] In the 2022 midterm elections , he endorsed over 200 candidates for various offices.

[ 438 ] In February 2021, he registered a new company, Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), for providing "social networking services" to U.S. customers.

[ 439 ] [ 440 ] In March 2024, TMTG merged with special-purpose acquisition company Digital World Acquisition and became a public company .

[ 453 ] [ 454 ] A federal grand jury constituted by Special Counsel Jack Smith indicted Trump in June 2023 on 31 counts of "willfully retaining national defense information" under the Espionage Act , among other charges.

[ 452 ] [ 455 ] [ 456 ] Trump pleaded not guilty.

[ 457 ] In July 2024, judge Aileen Cannon dismissed the case , ruling Smith's appointment as special prosecutor was unconstitutional.

[ 458 ] In May 2024, Trump was convicted on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records .

[ 459 ] The case stemmed from evidence that he booked Michael Cohen 's hush-money payments to adult film actress Stormy Daniels as business expenses to cover up his alleged 2006–2007 affair with Daniels during the 2016 election.

[ 459 ] [ 460 ] On January 10, 2025, the judge gave Trump a no-penalty sentence known as an unconditional discharge, saying that punitive requirements would have interfered with presidential immunity.

[ 461 ] After his reelection, the 2020 election obstruction case and the classified documents case were dismissed without prejudice due to Justice Department policy against prosecuting sitting presidents.

[ 475 ] [ 476 ] [ 477 ] [ 478 ] His rhetoric, calling his political opponents "the enemy", vermin, and fascists, has been described by some historians and scholars as authoritarian, fascist , [ i ] and unlike anything a political candidate has ever said in American history.

[ 483 ] [ 474 ] [ 484 ] Age and health concerns also arose during the campaign, with several medical experts highlighting an increase in rambling, tangential speech and behavioral disinhibition .

[ 485 ] Trump mentioned "rigged election" and "election interference" earlier and more frequently than in the 2016 and 2020 campaigns and refused to commit to accepting the 2024 election results.

[ 486 ] [ 487 ] Analysts for The New York Times described this as an intensification of his "heads I win; tails you cheated" rhetorical strategy; the newspaper stated that the claim of a rigged election had become the backbone of the campaign.

[ 533 ] By late February, the administration had fired more than 30,000 people.

[ 534 ] To facilitate further terminations, it adopted a novel legal interpretation that vastly expands the range of departments and agencies considered as having national security for their primary function, [ 535 ] [ 536 ] [ 537 ] declaring various federal workers' unions "hostile".

[ 538 ] [ 539 ] A late March executive order based on this interpretation excluded dozens of departments and agencies from federal labor-management relations programs , prompting them to sue to invalidate their collective bargaining agreements , [ 540 ] [ 537 ] which could remove union protections from one million federal employees.

[ 666 ] He claimed credit for pressuring the government to publish Obama's birth certificate, which he considered fraudulent.

[ 667 ] He acknowledged that Obama was born in the U.S. in September 2016, [ 668 ] though reportedly expressed birther views privately in 2017.

[ 669 ] During the 2024 presidential campaign, he made false attacks against the racial identity of his opponent, Kamala Harris, that were described as reminiscent of the birther conspiracy theory.

[ 670 ] His 2024 campaign made extensive use of dehumanizing language and racial stereotypes .

[ 671 ] [ 672 ] [ 673 ] [ 674 ] In 2025, he promoted false claims of white genocide in South Africa [ 675 ] and created the White South African refugee program .

[ 676 ] Trump has a history of belittling women when speaking to the media and on social media.

[ 677 ] [ 678 ] He made lewd comments, disparaged women's physical appearances, and referred to them using derogatory epithets.

[ 678 ] At least 25 women publicly accused him of sexual misconduct , including rape, kissing without consent, groping, looking under women's skirts, and walking in on naked teenage pageant contestants. He has denied the allegations.

[ 679 ] In October 2016, a 2005 " hot mic " recording surfaced in which he bragged about kissing and groping women without their consent, saying that, "when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. ... Grab 'em by the pussy ." [ 680 ] He characterized the comments as "locker-room talk".

[ 681 ] [ 682 ] The incident's widespread media exposure led to his first public apology, videotaped during his 2016 presidential campaign.

[ 683 ] Link to violence and hate crimes Further information: Rhetoric of Donald Trump § Violence Trump has been identified as a key figure in increasing political violence in the U.S., both for and against him.

[ 684 ] [ 685 ] [ 686 ] He is described as embracing extremism, conspiracy theories such as Q-Anon , and far-right militia movements to a greater extent than any modern American president, [ 635 ] [ 687 ] and engaging in stochastic terrorism .

[ 688 ] [ 689 ] Research suggests Trump's rhetoric is associated with an increased incidence of hate crimes, [ 690 ] [ 691 ] and that he has an emboldening effect on expressing prejudicial attitudes due to his normalization of explicit racial rhetoric.

[ 692 ] During his 2016 campaign, he urged or praised physical attacks against protesters or reporters.

[ 693 ] [ 694 ] Numerous defendants investigated or prosecuted for violent acts and hate crimes cited his rhetoric in arguing that they were not culpable or should receive leniency.

[ 695 ] [ 696 ] A nationwide review by ABC News in May 2020 identified at least 54 criminal cases, from August 2015 to April 2020, in which he was invoked in direct connection with violence or threats of violence mostly by white men and primarily against minorities.

[ 697 ] Trump's refusal to condemn the white supremacist Proud Boys during a 2020 presidential debate [ 698 ] and his comment, "Proud Boys, stand back and stand by", were said to have led to increased recruitment for the pro-Trump group.

[ 699 ] Counterterrorism researchers described his normalization and revisionist history of the January 6 Capitol attack, and grant of clemency to all January 6 rioters , as encouraging future political violence.

[ 700 ] [ 701 ] Conspiracy theories Main article: List of conspiracy theories promoted by Donald Trump Since before his first presidency, Trump has promoted numerous conspiracy theories, including Obama "birtherism", global warming being a hoax , and alleged Ukrainian interference in U.S. elections .

[ 702 ] [ 703 ] [ 704 ] After the 2020 presidential election, he promoted conspiracy theories for his defeat that were characterized as " the big lie ".

[ 705 ] [ 706 ] False or misleading statements Main article: False or misleading statements by Donald Trump Fact-checkers from The Washington Post , [ 707 ] the Toronto Star , [ 708 ] and CNN [ 709 ] compiled data on "false or misleading claims" (orange background) and "false claims" (violet foreground).

Trump frequently makes false statements in public remarks [ 710 ] [ 150 ] to an extent unprecedented in American politics .

[ 710 ] [ 711 ] [ 712 ] His falsehoods are a distinctive part of his political identity [ 711 ] and have been described as firehosing .

[ 713 ] His false and misleading statements were documented by fact-checkers , including at The Washington Post , which tallied 30,573 false or misleading statements made by him during his first presidency, [ 707 ] increasing in frequency over time.

[ 714 ] Some of Trump's falsehoods were inconsequential, [ 715 ] [ 716 ] while others had more far-reaching effects, such as his unproven promotion of antimalarial drugs as a treatment for COVID-19, [ 717 ] [ 718 ] causing a U.S. shortage of these drugs and panic-buying in Africa and South Asia.

[ 719 ] [ 720 ] Other misinformation, such as misattributing a rise in crime in England and Wales to the "spread of radical Islamic terror", served his domestic political purposes.

[ 721 ] His attacks on mail-in ballots and other election practices weakened public faith in the integrity of the 2020 presidential election, [ 722 ] [ 723 ] while his disinformation about the pandemic delayed and weakened the national response to it.

[ 724 ] [ 725 ] [ 726 ] He habitually does not apologize for his falsehoods.

[ 727 ] Until 2018, the media rarely referred to his falsehoods as lies, including when he repeated demonstrably false statements.

[ 728 ] [ 729 ] [ 730 ] Social media Main articles: Social media use by Donald Trump and Twitter use by Donald Trump See also: Personal and business legal affairs of Donald Trump § Lawsuits over social media ban Trump's social media presence attracted worldwide attention after he joined Twitter in 2009. He posted frequently during his 2016 campaign and as president until Twitter banned him after the January 6 attack.

[ 731 ] He often used Twitter to communicate directly with the public and sideline the press; [ 732 ] in 2017, his press secretary said that his tweets constituted official presidential statements.

[ 733 ] After years of criticism for allowing Trump to post misinformation and falsehoods, Twitter began to tag some of his tweets with fact-checks in May 2020.

[ 734 ] In response, he said social media platforms "totally silence" conservatives and he would "strongly regulate, or close them down".

[ 735 ] After the January 6 attack, he was banned from Facebook , Instagram , Twitter, and other platforms.

[ 736 ] The loss of his social media presence diminished his ability to shape events [ 737 ] [ 738 ] and correlated with a dramatic decrease in the volume of misinformation on Twitter.

[ 739 ] In February 2022, he launched social media platform Truth Social where he attracted a fraction of his Twitter following.

[ 740 ] Elon Musk , after acquiring Twitter , reinstated his Twitter account in November 2022.

[ 741 ] [ 742 ] Meta Platforms ' two-year ban lapsed in January 2023, allowing him to return to Facebook and Instagram.

[ 743 ] Relationship with the press Further information: First presidency of Donald Trump § Relationship with the news media , Personal and business legal affairs of Donald Trump , and Donald Trump's conflict with the media Talking to the press, March 2017 Trump sought media attention throughout his career, maintaining a "love-hate" relationship with the press.

[ 744 ] In the 2016 campaign, he benefited from a record amount of free media coverage, [ 745 ] estimated at $2 billion.

[ 746 ] As a candidate and as president, he frequently accused the press of bias, calling it the "fake news media" and "the enemy of the people ".

[ 747 ] The first Trump presidency reduced formal press briefings from about one hundred in 2017 to about half that in 2018 and to two in 2019; they also revoked the press passes of two White House reporters, which were restored by the courts.

[ 748 ] Trump's 2020 presidential campaign sued The New York Times , The Washington Post , and CNN for defamation in opinion pieces about his stance on Russian election interference. All the suits were dismissed.

[ 749 ] [ 750 ] By 2024, Trump repeatedly voiced support for outlawing political dissent and criticism, [ 751 ] and said that reporters should be prosecuted for not divulging confidential sources and media companies should possibly lose their broadcast licenses for unfavorable coverage of him.

[ 752 ] Following his reelection, Trump launched lawsuits and created blacklists against certain media outlets, and took over the process run by the White House Correspondents' Association to choose what outlets have access to him.

[ 753 ] Rather than comply with a court order to restore Associated Press access, the White House made a policy of limited access for all wire services.

[ 754 ] The Federal Communications Commission launched investigations into media outlets accused of bias against him.

[ 755 ] Personal life Family Further information: Trump family In 1977, Trump married Ivana.

[ 756 ] They had three children: Donald Jr.

(b. 1977), Ivanka (b. 1981), and Eric (b. 1984). The couple divorced in 1990, following his affair with model and actress Marla Maples .

[ 757 ] He and Maples married in 1993 and divorced in 1999. They have one daughter, Tiffany (b. 1993), whom Maples raised in California.

[ 758 ] In 2005, he married Slovenian model Melania Knauss .

[ 759 ] They have one son, Barron (b. 2006).

[ 760 ] Health Main article: Age and health concerns about Donald Trump Trump says he has never drunk alcohol, smoked cigarettes, or used drugs.

[ 761 ] [ 762 ] He sleeps about four or five hours a night.

[ 763 ] [ 764 ] He has called golfing his "primary form of exercise", but usually does not walk the course.

[ 765 ] He considers exercise a waste of energy because he believes the body is "like a battery, with a finite amount of energy", which is depleted by exercise.

[ 766 ] [ 767 ] In 2015, his campaign released a letter from his longtime personal physician, Harold Bornstein , stating that he would "be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency".

[ 768 ] In 2018, Bornstein said Trump had dictated the contents of the letter and that three of Trump's agents had seized his medical records in a February 2017 raid on Bornstein's office.

[ 768 ] [ 769 ] Religion Main article: Donald Trump and religion Trump said in 2016 that he was a Presbyterian and a Protestant .

[ 770 ] [ 771 ] In 2020, he said he was a nondenominational Christian .

[ 772 ] However, many have questioned the depth of these religious affiliations. A survey during Trump's first presidency (2017–2021) showed that 63 percent of Americans did not believe he was religious, despite his professed Christian affiliation, and that only 44 percent of Americans believed that Trump was a Christian.

[ 773 ] Some of Trump's comments on the Bible or Christian practice have led critical observers to suggest that his knowledge of Christianity is superficial or erroneous, and few biographers have described Trump as deeply or even particularly religious.

[ 774 ] [ 775 ] In his first term, Trump appointed his personal pastor [ 776 ] and spiritual advisor, [ 777 ] millionaire televangelist Paula White-Cain , to the White House Office of Public Liaison .

[ 778 ] In his second term, he appointed her senior advisor to the newly created White House Faith Office .

[ 779 ] [ 780 ] Assessments Public image Main articles: Public image of Donald Trump and Donald Trump in popular culture See also: Opinion polling on the first Donald Trump administration and Opinion polling on the second Donald Trump administration In Trump's first term, from 2017 to 2020, international approval ratings of U.S. leadership dropped from about 22 percent in a Gallup poll [ 781 ] of 134 countries to just 16 percent—lower than China's Xi Jinping and Russia's Vladimir Putin —in a Pew Research poll [ 782 ] of 13 countries. In 2017, estimation of U.S. leadership declined most among allies.

[ 783 ] Domestically, in his first term, Trump had chiefly partisan support: 88 percent among Republicans and 7 percent among Democrats.

[ 784 ] In a 2021 Gallup poll, he was the only president never to reach a 50 percent approval rating, and he was the first not to be named most admired in his first year in office.

[ 785 ] In his second term's first quarter according to Gallup, Trump's approval rating was 45 percent—somewhat better than his first term, and far below the 60 percent average of other presidents. Support remained polarized; he had the approval of 90 percent among Republicans, 37 percent among independents, and 4 percent among Democrats.

[ 786 ] Scholarly rankings Further information: Historical rankings of presidents of the United States In C-SPAN 's 2021 survey of presidential historians, [ 787 ] historians ranked Trump as the fourth-worst president. He rated lowest in the leadership characteristics categories for moral authority and administrative skills.

[ 788 ] [ 789 ] The Siena College Research Institute 's 2022 survey ranked him third-worst. He was ranked near the bottom in all categories except for luck, willingness to take risks, and party leadership, and ranked last in several categories.

[ 790 ] In 2018 and 2024, members of the American Political Science Association ranked him the worst president.

[ 791 ] [ 792 ] See also List of awards and honors received by Donald Trump Pseudonyms used by Donald Trump Notes ^ Beginning when Trump was three years old, his father gave each of his children $6,000 every year, the maximum allowed without incurring a gift tax. To avoid taxes, Fred made them landlords of two of his housing developments, paying each $13,928 in rent every year.

^ Outside of his boasts, he was neither the best baseball player in New York state, nor the academy's best athlete.

[ 10 ] ^ Later, in 2015, he threatened his high school, colleges, and the College Board with legal action if they released his academic records.

[ 12 ] ^ UPenn's 1968 commencement program lists Trump as a recipient of a Bachelor's of Science in Economics and not a recipient of Academic Honors.

[...] The Post examined 337 lawsuits filed against the administration since Trump returned to the White House and began a rapid-fire effort to reshape government programs and policy. As of mid-July, courts had ruled against the administration in 165 of the lawsuits. The Post found that the administration is accused of defying or frustrating court oversight in 57 of those cases — almost 35 percent.

He not only revived some of the same expansive understandings of executive authority that were left unaddressed, but went even further with new claims of sweeping and inherent constitutional clout.

He has long favored the language of violence in his political discourse, encouraging supporters to beat up hecklers, threatening to shoot looters and undocumented migrants, mocking a near-fatal attack on the husband of the Democratic House speaker and suggesting that a general he deemed disloyal be executed.
