It was established in 2015, [ 1 ] [ 2 ] and comprises 43 percent of the island.

[ 3 ] The park includes various habitats including coastal bluffs and freshwater areas. It is home to kauri forest, pōhutukawa ( Metrosideros excelsa ), kānuka ( Kunzea ericoides ), Great Barrier tree daisy ( Olearia allomii ), kākā , brown teal , spotless crake , fernbird , rare frogs, paua slugs and niho taniwha (chevron skink).

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] It is the largest Department of Conservation park in the Auckland Region , similar in size to the Hunua Regional Park and Waitakere Ranges Regional Park . It is also the largest possum-free forest in New Zealand.

[ 5 ] History [ edit ] A major storm in June and July 2014 delayed work to establish the park, [ 5 ] and survey the area for Kauri dieback .

[ 6 ] The park opened the following year in 2015.

[ 1 ] The Department of Conservation closed some tracks in the park between 2018 and 2020 due to Kauri dieback. The tracks were upgraded, and reopened in January 2020.

[ 7 ] Auckland Council and Ngāti Rehua Ngati Wai ki Aotea surveyed the park for Kauri dieback in November 2020.

[ 6 ] In the same month, a report by the Environmental Defence Society concluded the Department of Conservation had a "woeful lack of funding" to manage and protect the park.
