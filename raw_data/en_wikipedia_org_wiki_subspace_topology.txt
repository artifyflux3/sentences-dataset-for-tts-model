For the topology generated by a family of functions, see Initial topology .

In topology and related areas of mathematics , a subspace of a topological space ( X , ùúè ) is a subset S of X which is equipped with a topology induced from that of ùúè called the subspace topology [ 1 ] (or the relative topology , [ 1 ] inherited topology , [ 2 ] induced topology , [ 1 ] or trace topology ).

[ 3 ] Definition [ edit ] Given a topological space ( X , œÑ œÑ ) {\displaystyle (X,\tau )} and a subset S {\displaystyle S} of X {\displaystyle X} , the subspace topology on S {\displaystyle S} is defined by œÑ œÑ S = { S ‚à© ‚à© U ‚à£ ‚à£ U ‚àà ‚àà œÑ œÑ } .

{\displaystyle \tau _{S}=\lbrace S\cap U\mid U\in \tau \rbrace .} That is, a subset of S {\displaystyle S} is open in the subspace topology if and only if it is the intersection of S {\displaystyle S} with an open set in ( X , œÑ œÑ ) {\displaystyle (X,\tau )} . If S {\displaystyle S} is equipped with the subspace topology then it is a topological space in its own right, and is called a subspace of ( X , œÑ œÑ ) {\displaystyle (X,\tau )} . Subsets of topological spaces are usually assumed to be equipped with the subspace topology unless otherwise stated.

Alternatively we can define the subspace topology for a subset S {\displaystyle S} of X {\displaystyle X} as the coarsest topology for which the inclusion map Œπ Œπ : S ‚Ü™ ‚Ü™ X {\displaystyle \iota :S\hookrightarrow X} is continuous .

More generally, suppose Œπ Œπ {\displaystyle \iota } is an injection from a set S {\displaystyle S} to a topological space X {\displaystyle X} . Then the subspace topology on S {\displaystyle S} is defined as the coarsest topology for which Œπ Œπ {\displaystyle \iota } is continuous. The open sets in this topology are precisely the ones of the form Œπ Œπ ‚àí ‚àí 1 ( U ) {\displaystyle \iota ^{-1}(U)} for U {\displaystyle U} open in X {\displaystyle X} .

S {\displaystyle S} is then homeomorphic to its image in X {\displaystyle X} (also with the subspace topology) and Œπ Œπ {\displaystyle \iota } is called a topological embedding .

A subspace S {\displaystyle S} is called an open subspace if the injection Œπ Œπ {\displaystyle \iota } is an open map , i.e., if the forward image of an open set of S {\displaystyle S} is open in X {\displaystyle X} . Likewise it is called a closed subspace if the injection Œπ Œπ {\displaystyle \iota } is a closed map .

Terminology [ edit ] The distinction between a set and a topological space is often blurred notationally, for convenience, which can be a source of confusion when one first encounters these definitions. Thus, whenever S {\displaystyle S} is a subset of X {\displaystyle X} , and ( X , œÑ œÑ ) {\displaystyle (X,\tau )} is a topological space, then the unadorned symbols " S {\displaystyle S} " and " X {\displaystyle X} " can often be used to refer both to S {\displaystyle S} and X {\displaystyle X} considered as two subsets of X {\displaystyle X} , and also to ( S , œÑ œÑ S ) {\displaystyle (S,\tau _{S})} and ( X , œÑ œÑ ) {\displaystyle (X,\tau )} as the topological spaces, related as discussed above. So phrases such as " S {\displaystyle S} an open subspace of X {\displaystyle X} " are used to mean that ( S , œÑ œÑ S ) {\displaystyle (S,\tau _{S})} is an open subspace of ( X , œÑ œÑ ) {\displaystyle (X,\tau )} , in the sense used above; that is: (i) S ‚àà ‚àà œÑ œÑ {\displaystyle S\in \tau } ; and (ii) S {\displaystyle S} is considered to be endowed with the subspace topology.

Examples [ edit ] In the following, R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } represents the real numbers with their usual topology.

The subspace topology of the natural numbers , as a subspace of R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } , is the discrete topology .

The rational numbers Q {\displaystyle \mathbb {Q} } considered as a subspace of R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } do not have the discrete topology ({0} for example is not an open set in Q {\displaystyle \mathbb {Q} } because there is no open subset of R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } whose intersection with Q {\displaystyle \mathbb {Q} } can result in only the singleton {0}). If a and b are rational, then the intervals ( a , b ) and [ a , b ] are respectively open and closed, but if a and b are irrational, then the set of all rational x with a < x < b is both open and closed.

The set [0,1] as a subspace of R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } is both open and closed, whereas as a subset of R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } it is only closed.

As a subspace of R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } , [0, 1] ‚à™ [2, 3] is composed of two disjoint open subsets (which happen also to be closed), and is therefore a disconnected space .

Let S = [0, 1) be a subspace of the real line R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } . Then [0, 1 ‚ÅÑ 2 ) is open in S but not in R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } (as for example the intersection between (- 1 ‚ÅÑ 2 , 1 ‚ÅÑ 2 ) and S results in [0, 1 ‚ÅÑ 2 )). Likewise [ 1 ‚ÅÑ 2 , 1) is closed in S but not in R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } (as there is no open subset of R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } that can intersect with [0, 1) to result in [ 1 ‚ÅÑ 2 , 1)).

S is both open and closed as a subset of itself but not as a subset of R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } .

Properties [ edit ] The subspace topology has the following characteristic property. Let Y {\displaystyle Y} be a subspace of X {\displaystyle X} and let i : Y ‚Üí ‚Üí X {\displaystyle i:Y\to X} be the inclusion map. Then for any topological space Z {\displaystyle Z} a map f : Z ‚Üí ‚Üí Y {\displaystyle f:Z\to Y} is continuous if and only if the composite map i ‚àò ‚àò f {\displaystyle i\circ f} is continuous.

Characteristic property of the subspace topology This property is characteristic in the sense that it can be used to define the subspace topology on Y {\displaystyle Y} .

We list some further properties of the subspace topology. In the following let S {\displaystyle S} be a subspace of X {\displaystyle X} .

If f : X ‚Üí ‚Üí Y {\displaystyle f:X\to Y} is continuous then the restriction to S {\displaystyle S} is continuous.

If f : X ‚Üí ‚Üí Y {\displaystyle f:X\to Y} is continuous then f : X ‚Üí ‚Üí f ( X ) {\displaystyle f:X\to f(X)} is continuous.

The closed sets in S {\displaystyle S} are precisely the intersections of S {\displaystyle S} with closed sets in X {\displaystyle X} .

If A {\displaystyle A} is a subspace of S {\displaystyle S} then A {\displaystyle A} is also a subspace of X {\displaystyle X} with the same topology. In other words, the subspace topology that A {\displaystyle A} inherits from S {\displaystyle S} is the same as the one it inherits from X {\displaystyle X} .

Suppose S {\displaystyle S} is an open subspace of X {\displaystyle X} (so S ‚àà ‚àà œÑ œÑ {\displaystyle S\in \tau } ). Then a subset of S {\displaystyle S} is open in S {\displaystyle S} if and only if it is open in X {\displaystyle X} .

Suppose S {\displaystyle S} is a closed subspace of X {\displaystyle X} (so X ‚àñ ‚àñ S ‚àà ‚àà œÑ œÑ {\displaystyle X\setminus S\in \tau } ). Then a subset of S {\displaystyle S} is closed in S {\displaystyle S} if and only if it is closed in X {\displaystyle X} .

If B {\displaystyle B} is a basis for X {\displaystyle X} then B S = { U ‚à© ‚à© S : U ‚àà ‚àà B } {\displaystyle B_{S}=\{U\cap S:U\in B\}} is a basis for S {\displaystyle S} .

The topology induced on a subset of a metric space by restricting the metric to this subset coincides with subspace topology for this subset.

Preservation of topological properties [ edit ] If a topological space having some topological property implies its subspaces have that property, then we say the property is hereditary . If only closed subspaces must share the property we call it weakly hereditary .

Every open and every closed subspace of a completely metrizable space is completely metrizable.

Every open subspace of a Baire space is a Baire space.

Every closed subspace of a compact space is compact.

Being a Hausdorff space is hereditary.

Being a normal space is weakly hereditary.

Total boundedness is hereditary.

Being totally disconnected is hereditary.

First countability and second countability are hereditary.
