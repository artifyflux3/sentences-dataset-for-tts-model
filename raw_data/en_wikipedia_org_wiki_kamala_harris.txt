[ 130 ] Later that month, Harris was one of 12 Democratic senators led by Mazie Hirono to sign a letter questioning Barr's decision to offer "his own conclusion that the President's conduct did not amount to obstruction of justice", and called for an investigation into whether Barr's summary of the Mueller report and his statements at a news conference were misleading.

[ 131 ] In April 2019, Harris was one of 34 Senate Democrats and independents to write a letter urging President Trump not to cut aid to El Salvador , Guatemala , and Honduras . The group wrote: [ 132 ] We encourage you to listen to members of your own Administration and reverse a decision that will damage our national security and aggravate conditions inside Central America....Since taking office, you have consistently expressed a flawed understanding of U.S. foreign assistance. It is neither charity, nor is it a gift to foreign governments. Our national security funding is specifically designed to promote American interests, enhance our collective security, and protect the safety of our citizens... By obstructing the use of [Fiscal Year 2018] national security funding and seeking to terminate similar funding from [Fiscal Year 2017], you are personally undermining efforts to promote U.S. national security and economic prosperity.

[ 133 ] During the hearing, he remained defiant about the misrepresentations in the four-page summary he had released ahead of the full report.

According to election law expert Richard L. Hasen , "I have seen no good evidence that the suppressive effects of strict voting and registration laws affected the outcome of the governor's races in Georgia and Florida."

[ 162 ] During the first Democratic presidential debate in June 2019, Harris scolded former vice president Joe Biden for "hurtful" remarks he made, speaking fondly of senators who opposed integration efforts in the 1970s and working with them to oppose mandatory school bussing.

[ 163 ] Harris's support rose by between six and nine points in polls after that debate.

[ 164 ] In the second debate in August, Biden and Representative Tulsi Gabbard confronted Harris over her record as attorney general.

In May 2019, senior members of the Congressional Black Caucus endorsed the idea of a Biden–Harris ticket.

[ 177 ] In late February 2020, Biden won a landslide victory in the 2020 South Carolina Democratic primary with the endorsement of House whip Jim Clyburn , with more victories on Super Tuesday . In early March, Clyburn suggested Biden choose a black woman as a running mate, saying, "African American women needed to be rewarded for their loyalty".

[ 178 ] In March, Biden committed to choosing a woman for his running mate.

[ 179 ] On April 17, 2020, Harris responded to media speculation and said she "would be honored" to be Biden's running mate.

[ 180 ] In late May, in relation to the murder of George Floyd and ensuing protests and demonstrations , Biden faced renewed calls to select a black woman as his running mate, highlighting the law enforcement credentials of Harris and Val Demings .

[ 181 ] On June 12, The New York Times reported that Harris was emerging as the front-runner to be Biden's running mate, as she was the only African American woman with the political experience typical of vice presidents.

[ 182 ] On June 26, CNN reported that more than a dozen people close to the Biden search process considered Harris one of Biden's top four contenders, along with Elizabeth Warren , Val Demings , and Keisha Lance Bottoms .

[ 183 ] On August 11, 2020, Biden announced he had chosen Harris.

[ 189 ] [ 190 ] [ 191 ] [ 192 ] Harris is the third person with acknowledged non-European ancestry to become president or vice president.

[ d ] Her first act as vice president was to swear in three new senators: Alex Padilla (her successor in the Senate) and Georgia senators Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff .

[ 194 ] Senate presidency When Harris took office, the 117th Congress 's Senate was divided 50–50 between Republicans and Democrats ; [ 195 ] this meant that she was often called upon to exercise her power to cast tie-breaking votes as president of the Senate . Harris cast her first two tie-breaking votes on February 5. In February and March, Harris's tie-breaking votes were required to pass the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 stimulus package Biden proposed, since no Senate Republicans voted for it.

[ 196 ] [ 197 ] On July 20, Harris broke Mike Pence 's record for tie-breaking votes in the first year of a vice presidency [ 198 ] when she cast the seventh tie-breaking vote in her first six months.

[ 199 ] She cast 13 tie-breaking votes during her first year in office, the most tie-breaking votes in a single year in U.S. history, surpassing John Adams , who cast 12 in 1790.

[ 202 ] She was the first woman, and the third person overall, to assume the powers and duties of the presidency as acting president of the United States .

[ 203 ] [ 204 ] [ 205 ] As early as December 2021, Harris was identified as playing a pivotal role in the Biden administration owing to her tie-breaking vote in the evenly divided Senate as well as her being the presumed front-runner in 2024 if Biden did not seek reelection.

[ 206 ] Immigration Harris disembarks Marine Two at Joint Base Andrews beginning a trip to El Paso, Texas , June 2021.

On March 24, 2021, Biden assigned Harris to work with Mexico and Northern Triangle nations (El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras) to stem irregular migration to the Mexico–United States border and address the root causes of migration.

[ 207 ] [ 208 ] The Root Causes Strategy (RCS) was the product of this effort.

[ 209 ] Multiple news organizations at the time described Harris as a "border czar", [ 210 ] [ 211 ] [ 212 ] though Harris rejected the title and never actually held it.

[ 213 ] [ 214 ] [ 215 ] Republicans and other critics began using the term "border czar" to tie Harris to the Mexico–United States border crisis , including in a July 2024 House resolution, despite her having no authority over the border itself.

[ 216 ] [ 217 ] [ 218 ] Harris arrives in Guatemala City during her first foreign trip as vice president, June 2021.

Harris conducted her first international trip as vice president in June 2021, visiting Guatemala and Mexico in an attempt to address the root causes of an increase in migration from Central America to the United States .

[ 219 ] During her visit, in a joint press conference with Guatemalan president Alejandro Giammattei , Harris issued an appeal to potential migrants: "I want to be clear to folks in the region who are thinking about making that dangerous trek to the United States-Mexico border: Do not come. Do not come."

[ 224 ] Another meeting was held in November 2022 during Macron's visit to the U.S., resulting in an agreement to strengthen U.S.–France space cooperation across civil, commercial, and national security sectors.

[ 225 ] In April 2021, Harris said she was the last person in the room before Biden decided to remove all U.S. troops from Afghanistan , adding that Biden had "an extraordinary amount of courage" and "make[s] decisions based on what he truly believes ... is the right thing to do".

[ 226 ] National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said that Biden "insists she be in every core decision-making meeting. She weighs in during those meetings, often providing unique perspectives." [ 223 ] Harris assumed a "key diplomatic role" in the Biden administration, particularly after the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, after which she was dispatched to Germany and Poland to rally support for arming Ukraine and imposing sanctions on Russia.

[ 227 ] Harris meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House on July 25, 2024 In April 2023, Harris visited Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland with South Korean president Yoon Suk Yeol and agreed to work to strengthen the space alliance between the U.S. and South Korea. "We renew our commitment to strengthen our cooperation in the next frontier of our expanding alliance, and of course that is space," Harris said at a joint news conference with Yoon.

[ 228 ] In November 2023, Harris pledged that the Biden administration would place no conditions on U.S. aid to Israel in its war with Hamas in Gaza .

[ 229 ] In March 2024, she criticized Israel's actions during the Gaza war , saying, "Given the immense scale of suffering in Gaza, there must be an immediate ceasefire for at least the next six weeks...This will get the hostages out and get a significant amount of aid in." [ 230 ] 2024 presidential election Vice-presidential campaign In April 2023, President Biden initially announced his reelection campaign , with Harris expected to remain his running mate. After the Democratic primaries , the pair became the party's presumptive nominees in the 2024 presidential election .

Concerns about Biden's age and health persisted throughout Biden's first term, with renewed scrutiny after his performance in the first presidential debate , on June 27.

Presidential campaign Main article: Kamala Harris 2024 presidential campaign Harris and Tim Walz at a presidential campaign rally at Desert Diamond Arena in Glendale, Arizona , August 2024 The 2024 election with electoral votes by state On July 21, 2024, Biden suspended his reelection campaign and immediately endorsed Harris for president.

[ 231 ] She was also endorsed by Jimmy Carter , Bill and Hillary Clinton , Barack and Michelle Obama , the Congressional Black Caucus , and many others .

[ 232 ] [ 233 ] [ 234 ] [ 235 ] In the first 24 hours of her candidacy, her campaign raised $81 million in small-dollar donations, the highest single-day total of any presidential candidate in history.

[ 236 ] By August 5, Harris had officially secured the nomination via a virtual roll call of delegates.

[ 237 ] [ 238 ] [ 239 ] The next day, she announced Minnesota governor Tim Walz as her vice-presidential running mate .

[ 240 ] On August 22, the fourth day of the Democratic National Convention , Harris officially accepted the Democratic nomination for president.

[ 241 ] On September 10, 2024, ABC News hosted the presidential debate between Harris and Trump in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania .

[ 242 ] In the debate, Trump tried to portray Harris as a "radical liberal".

[ 243 ] Harris's sharpest criticisms of Trump came on abortion rights , where she said she would restore women's rights to what they were under Roe .

[ 244 ] Harris was declared the winner of the debate by several political analysts, including columnists from CNN , [ 245 ] Politico , [ 246 ] The New York Times , [ 247 ] and USA Today .

[ 248 ] Some analysts noted that for Harris, this was the "best debate performance of her career," in which she forcefully highlighted her strengths and rattled former president Trump.

[ 246 ] [ 248 ] After the debate, Harris got a prominent celebrity endorsement from Taylor Swift .

[ 248 ] However, the polls remained close and showed Harris had a hard time conveying that she could represent a "change".

[ 249 ] [ 250 ] On October 30, Harris delivered a half-hour speech at the Ellipse in Washington, D.C.

, intended as a "closing argument" for her campaign.

[ 251 ] [ 252 ] Her statements about tax-funded gender-affirming surgery for transgender people in prison were attacked by Trump, who spent millions on a political advertisement that said, " Kamala is for they/them , President Trump is for you." Trump's campaign spent more money on the advertisement than any other in the campaign.

[ 253 ] [ 254 ] Harris lost the 2024 United States presidential election to Trump on November 5, 2024.

[ 255 ] She conceded the race the next day in a speech at her alma mater, Howard University.

[ 256 ] Harris lost the Electoral College vote, 312 to 226, and the popular vote, 48.3% to 49.8%. Losses in the " blue wall " states of Wisconsin , Michigan , and Pennsylvania were considered key to her defeat, as were losses in the swing states of Nevada , Arizona , Georgia , and North Carolina .

[ 257 ] Harris's loss was part of a global backlash against incumbent parties in 2024, [ 258 ] [ 259 ] which occurred in part because of the 2021–2023 inflation surge .

[ 260 ] [ 261 ] All 50 states and DC trended rightward compared to the 2020 presidential election.

[ 262 ] On January 6, 2025, in her role as president of the Senate , Harris oversaw the certification of Trump and Vance as the winners of the election.

[ 263 ] Had she won, Harris would have been the first female and first Asian-American president of the United States, and the second African-American president after Obama.

[ 264 ] Post-vice presidency (2025–present) Harris left office on January 20, 2025, succeeded by the 50th vice president of the United States , JD Vance . She and her husband moved to Los Angeles , [ 265 ] where they helped distribute food to victims of the Palisades Fire .

[ 266 ] On February 18, 2025, Harris signed with Creative Artists Agency (CAA) to focus on speaking and publishing opportunities.

[ 267 ] Four days later, she received the Chairman's prize at the 56th NAACP Image Awards .

[ 268 ] On March 21, 2025, President Trump took away a courtesy normally extended to former vice presidents by revoking Harris's security clearance .

[ 269 ] On April 30, 2025, Harris delivered remarks at a gala for the 20th anniversary of Emerge America in which she criticized the Trump administration, mainly for its handling of the economy and social issues.

[ 270 ] The next week, Vogue reported that Harris made a surprise appearance and her formal debut at the 2025 Met Gala , dressed in half white and black.

[ 271 ] Some speculated that Harris would run in the 2026 California gubernatorial election ; in July 2025, she announced she would not.

[ 272 ] She is also a potential candidate in the 2028 United States presidential election , [ 273 ] [ 274 ] [ 275 ] [ 276 ] and according to The Hill , most top Democratic officials have not discouraged the idea, with some publicly saying they would support her should she decide to run again.

[ 280 ] [ 281 ] On foreign policy, Harris supports continued military aid to Ukraine and Israel in their respective wars, but insists that Israel should agree to a ceasefire and hostage deal and work toward a two-state solution .

[ 282 ] She opposes an arms embargo on Israel .

[ 283 ] Harris has departed from Biden on economic issues, proposing what has been called a "populist" economic agenda.

[ 284 ] [ 285 ] Abortion Harris supports abortion rights , and reproductive health care was central to her presidential campaign.

[ 286 ] [ 287 ] She has been called "the Biden administration's voice for reproductive rights" [ 288 ] and "the White House's voice of unflinching support for reproductive health rights." [ 289 ] Several abortion rights and women's organizations supported her after Biden withdrew from the race, with Reproductive Freedom for All saying "there is nobody who has fought as hard [as Harris] for abortion rights and access" and EMILY's List calling her "our most powerful advocate and messenger" on reproductive rights.

[ 290 ] As of 2020, Harris had a 100% rating from the abortion rights advocacy group Planned Parenthood Action Fund , and a 0% rating from the anti-abortion group National Right to Life Committee .

[ 291 ] EMILY's List endorsed her in 2015, during her senatorial campaign.

[ 292 ] LGBTQ rights As California attorney general, Harris refused to defend Prop 8 in federal court, and after Prop 8 was struck down in Hollingsworth v. Perry in 2013, she ordered the Los Angeles County Clerk's office to "start the marriages immediately". She officiated at the wedding of the plaintiffs in the case, Kris Perry and Sandy Stier, at San Francisco City Hall .

[ 293 ] As a member of the U.S. Senate, Harris co-sponsored the Equality Act .

[ 294 ] In July 2018, Harris led her colleagues in introducing the Gay and Trans Panic Defense Prohibition Act of 2018, a nationwide bill that would curtail the effectiveness of the so-called gay and trans panic defenses , an issue she pioneered as district attorney of San Francisco.

[ 295 ] In October 2019, Harris participated in a CNN/Human Rights Campaign town hall on LGBTQ rights and pledged her support for "all of the folks who are fighting for equality" in cases that would determine whether gay and transgender people are protected under laws banning federal workplace discrimination.

[ 296 ] Harris drew attention to the epidemic of hate crimes committed against Black trans women (at the time 20 killed that year), noting that LGBTQ people of color are doubly discriminated against.

[ 297 ] [ 298 ] Harris has since been criticized for a 2015 federal court motion she filed to block gender-affirming medical care for a transgender inmate serving in a California state prison while she was California attorney general, after the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals had ruled that denying that treatment violated the 8th Amendment 's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment.

[ 299 ] [ 300 ] Criminal justice In December 2018, Harris voted for the First Step Act , legislation aimed at reducing recidivism rates among federal prisoners by expanding job training and other programs, in addition to forming an expansion of early release programs and modifications on sentencing laws such as mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders, "to more equitably punish drug offenders".

[ 301 ] In March 2020, Harris was one of 15 senators to sign a letter to the Federal Bureau of Prisons and private prison companies GEO Group , CoreCivic , and Management and Training Corporation requesting information on their strategy to address the COVID-19 pandemic , asserting that it was "critical that [you] have a plan to help prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus to incarcerated individuals and correctional staff, along with their families and loved ones, and provide treatment to incarcerated individuals and staff who become infected." [ 302 ] In June 2020, after a campaign by a coalition of community groups, including Black Lives Matter , Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti announced Los Angeles Police Department budget cuts of $150 million.

[ 303 ] Harris supported the decision: [ 304 ] [ 305 ] In 2020 Harris tweeted in support of donations to the Minnesota Freedom Fund , a bail fund assisting those arrested in the George Floyd protests , though she did not donate to the fund herself.

[ 306 ] Harris's criminal justice record has been seen as mixed, with critics calling her "tough on crime" even though she called herself a "progressive prosecutor", citing her reluctance to release prisoners and anti-truancy policies. In her 2009 book, Harris criticized liberals for what she called "biases against law enforcement".

[ 307 ] Personal life See also: Family of Kamala Harris Vice President Harris and her husband, Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff at the White House, May 2024 In the 1990s, Harris dated Willie Brown , Speaker of the California Assembly (1980–1995) and then Mayor of San Francisco (1996–2004).

[ 325 ] Harris quips, " You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?

" during a speech on May 10, 2023.

Harris experienced high staff turnover during her vice-presidential tenure, including the departures of her chief of staff, deputy chief of staff, press secretary, deputy press secretary, communications director, and chief speechwriter.

[ 326 ] Critics alleged that this turnover reflected dysfunction and demoralization.

[ 227 ] Axios reported that at least some of the turnover was due to exhaustion from a demanding transition into the new administration, as well as financial and personal considerations.

[ 327 ] For most of her tenure, Harris had one of the lowest approval ratings of any vice president.

[ 328 ] [ 329 ] [ 324 ] According to a RealClear Politics polling average, a record low of 34.8% of Americans had a favorable view of her in August 2022, but this number rose rapidly after she became the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee in July 2024. Harris had a net favorable rating by September 9.

[ 330 ] In 2024, a video clip from 2023 of Harris saying " You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?

You exist in the context of all in which you live and what came before you" at a White House event went viral .

[ 331 ] Since the launch of her 2024 presidential campaign, that and other Harris remarks have been widely shared as memes, resulting in press coverage of her public image.

[ 332 ] [ 333 ] Harris's often boisterous laughter [ e ] has been called one of her "most defining and most dissected personal traits".

[ 337 ] She says she got her laugh from her mother.
