He is an emeritus professor in the Department of Mathematics at the Open University , having previously been Head of the Pure Mathematics Department and Dean of the Faculty.

[ 1 ] He was a stipendiary lecturer at Pembroke College, Oxford [ 2 ] and, from 2004 to 2008, Gresham Professor of Geometry at Gresham College , London.

[ 3 ] On occasion, he teaches at Colorado College in the United States.

[ 4 ] He is also a long standing fellow of Keble College, Oxford .

Professor Wilson is a son of former British Prime Minister Harold Wilson and his wife, Mary .

Early life and education [ edit ] Wilson was born in 1943 to the politician Harold Wilson , who later became Prime Minister , and his wife the poet Mary Wilson ( née Baldwin). He has a younger brother, Giles, who in his 50s gave up a career as a teacher to be a train driver.

[ 5 ] Wilson attended University College School in Hampstead , North London. He achieved a BA First Class Honours in Mathematics from Balliol College , Oxford , an MA from the University of Pennsylvania , and a PhD from the University of Pennsylvania (1965–1968). In a Guardian interview in 2008, Wilson spoke of the fact he grew up known to everyone primarily as a son of the Labour Party leader and Prime Minister Harold Wilson: "I hated the attention and I still dislike being introduced as Harold Wilson's son. I feel uncomfortable talking about it to strangers even now." [ 6 ] Mathematics career [ edit ] Wilson's academic interests lie in graph theory , particularly in colouring problems, e.g. the four colour problem , and algebraic properties of graphs. He also researches the history of mathematics , particularly British mathematics and mathematics in the 17th century and the period 1860 to 1940, and the history of graph theory and combinatorics .

In 1974, he won the Lester R. Ford Award from the Mathematical Association of America for his expository article An introduction to matroid theory .

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] Due to his collaboration on a 1977 paper [ 9 ] with the Hungarian mathematician Paul Erdős , Wilson has an Erdős number of 1.

In July 2008, he published a study of the mathematical work of Lewis Carroll , the creator of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass — Lewis Carroll in Numberland: His Fantastical Mathematical Logical Life (Allen Lane, 2008.

ISBN 978-0-7139-9757-6 ). From January 1999 to September 2003, Wilson was editor-in-chief of the European Mathematical Society Newsletter and in 2003–2008 an Associate Editor.

[ 10 ] He is past President of the British Society for the History of Mathematics .

[ 11 ] Since 1985, Robin Wilson has edited the mathematics on stamps "Stamp Corner" column for the Mathematical Intelligencer .

[ 12 ] Other interests [ edit ] He has strong interests in music, including the operas of Gilbert and Sullivan , and is the co-author (with Frederic Lloyd ) of Gilbert and Sullivan: The Official D'Oyly Carte Picture History .

[ 13 ] In 2007, he was a guest on Private Passions , the biographical music discussion programme on BBC Radio 3 .

[ 14 ] Personal life [ edit ] Wilson is married and has twin daughters.

[ 15 ] Publications [ edit ] Wilson has written or edited about thirty books, including popular books on sudoku and the Four Color Theorem : Oxford's Savilian Professors of Geometry: The First 400 Years (editor), Oxford University Press, 2022: ISBN 978-0-19-886903-0 Number Theory: A Very Short Introduction , Oxford University Press, 2020: ISBN 978-0-19-879809-5 The Turing Guide (with Jack Copeland , Jonathan Bowen , Mark Sprevak, et al.), Oxford University Press , 2017: ISBN 978-0198747826 (hardcover), ISBN 978-0198747833 (paperback) [ 16 ] Combinatorics: A Very Short Introduction, Oxford University Press, 2016: ISBN 978-0-19-872349-3 Combinatorics: Ancient & Modern (with John Watkins), Oxford University Press, 2013: ISBN 0-19-965659-2 The Great Mathematicians (with Raymond Flood ), Arcturus Publishing Ltd, 2011: ISBN 1-84837-902-1 Lewis Carroll in Numberland: His Fantastical Mathematical Logical Life , Allen Lane, 2008: ISBN 978-0-7139-9757-6 Hidden Word Sudoku , Infinite Ideas Limited 2005: ISBN 1-904902-74-X How to Solve Sudoku , Infinite Ideas Limited 2005: ISBN 1-904902-62-6 Sherlock Holmes in Babylon and Other Tales of Mathematical History (co-edited with Marlow Anderson and Victor J.
