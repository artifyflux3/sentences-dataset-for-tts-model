[ 1 ] Each is appointed by and is responsible to the other members of that body, who delegate to the president the day-to-day running of the university.

Harvard's current president is Alan Garber , who took office on January 2, 2024, following the resignation of Claudine Gay . In August 2024, the Harvard Corporation announced he would be in the position until mid-2027.

[ 2 ] Role [ edit ] The president plays an important part in university-wide planning and strategy. Each names a faculty's dean (and, since the foundation of the office in 1994, the university's provost ), and grants tenure to recommended professors. However, the president is expected to make such decisions after extensive consultation with faculty members.

Recently, however, the job has become increasingly administrative, especially as fund-raising campaigns have taken on central importance in large institutions such as Harvard. Some have criticized this trend to the extent it has prevented the president from focusing on substantive issues in higher education.

[ 3 ] Each president is professor in some department of the university and teaches from time to time.

The university maintains an official residence for the president's use, which from 1912 until 1971, was President's House , and since then has been Elmwood .

[ 4 ] Influence [ edit ] Five Harvard University presidents, sitting in order of when they served. Left-to-right: Josiah Quincy III , Edward Everett , Jared Sparks , James Walker and Cornelius Conway Felton .

Harvard presidents have traditionally influenced educational practices nationwide.

Charles W. Eliot , for example, originated America's familiar system of a smorgasbord of elective courses available to each student; James B. Conant worked to introduce standardized testing; Derek Bok and Neil L. Rudenstine argued for the continued importance of diversity in higher education.

History [ edit ] At Harvard's founding it was headed by a "schoolmaster", Nathaniel Eaton . In 1640, when Henry Dunster was brought in, he adopted the title of president. Since Harvard was founded for the training of Puritan clergy, and even though its mission was soon broadened, nearly all presidents through the end of the 18th century were in holy orders.

All presidents from Leonard Hoar in 1672 through Nathan Pusey in 1971 were graduates of Harvard College . Of the presidents since Pusey, nearly all earned a graduate degree at Harvard. The only exception has been Drew Gilpin Faust , who was the first president since the seventeenth century with no earned Harvard degree.

Presidents of Harvard [ edit ] No.
