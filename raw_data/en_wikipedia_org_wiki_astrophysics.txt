Early 1900s comparison of elemental, solar, and stellar spectra

**Astrophysics** is a science that employs the methods and principles of [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics") and [chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry "Chemistry") in the study of [astronomical objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_object "Astronomical object") and phenomena.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics#cite_note-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics#cite_note-2) As one of the founders of the discipline, [James Keeler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Edward_Keeler "James Edward Keeler"), said, astrophysics "seeks to ascertain the nature of the heavenly bodies, rather than their positions or motions in spaceâ€”_what_ they are, rather than _where_ they are",[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics#cite_note-3) which is studied in [celestial mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_mechanics "Celestial mechanics").

Among the subjects studied are the [Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun "Sun") ([solar physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_physics "Solar physics")), other [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star "Star"), [galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy "Galaxy"), [extrasolar planets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrasolar_planet "Extrasolar planet"), the [interstellar medium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_medium "Interstellar medium"), and the [cosmic microwave background](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background "Cosmic microwave background").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics#cite_note-nasa.gov-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics#cite_note-5) Emissions from these objects are examined across all parts of the [electromagnetic spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum "Electromagnetic spectrum"), and the properties examined include [luminosity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminosity "Luminosity"), [density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density "Density"), [temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature "Temperature"), and [chemical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry "Chemistry") composition. Because astrophysics is a very broad subject, _astrophysicists_ apply concepts and methods from many disciplines of physics, including [classical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics "Classical mechanics"), [electromagnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetism "Electromagnetism"), [statistical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_mechanics "Statistical mechanics"), [thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamics "Thermodynamics"), [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics"), [relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_relativity "Theory of relativity"), [nuclear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_physics "Nuclear physics") and [particle physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics "Particle physics"), and [atomic and molecular physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic,_molecular,_and_optical_physics "Atomic, molecular, and optical physics").

In practice, modern astronomical research often involves substantial work in the realms of [theoretical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_physics "Theoretical physics") and observational physics. Some areas of study for astrophysicists include the properties of [dark matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter "Dark matter"), [dark energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_energy "Dark energy"), [black holes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_holes "Black holes"), and other [celestial bodies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_bodies "Celestial bodies"); and the [origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmogony "Cosmogony") and [ultimate fate of the universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_fate_of_the_universe "Ultimate fate of the universe").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics#cite_note-nasa.gov-4) Topics also studied by theoretical astrophysicists include [Solar System formation and evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_and_evolution_of_the_Solar_System "Formation and evolution of the Solar System"); [stellar dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_dynamics "Stellar dynamics") and [evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_evolution "Stellar evolution"); [galaxy formation and evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_formation_and_evolution "Galaxy formation and evolution"); [magnetohydrodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetohydrodynamics "Magnetohydrodynamics"); [large-scale structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large-scale_structure_of_the_universe "Large-scale structure of the universe") of [matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter "Matter") in the universe; origin of [cosmic rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_ray "Cosmic ray"); [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity"), [special relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity "Special relativity"), and [quantum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_cosmology "Quantum cosmology") and [physical cosmology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_cosmology "Physical cosmology") (the physical study of the largest-scale structures of the universe), including [string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory "String theory") cosmology and [astroparticle physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astroparticle_physics "Astroparticle physics").

Astronomy is an ancient science, long separated from the study of terrestrial physics. In the [Aristotelian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle "Aristotle") worldview, bodies in the sky appeared to be unchanging [spheres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_spheres "Celestial spheres") whose only motion was uniform motion in a circle, while the earthly world was the realm which underwent [growth and decay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Generation_and_Corruption "On Generation and Corruption") and in which natural motion was in a straight line and ended when the moving object reached its [goal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telos "Telos"). Consequently, it was held that the celestial region was made of a fundamentally different kind of matter from that found in the terrestrial sphere; either [Fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_(classical_element) "Fire (classical element)") as maintained by [Plato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato "Plato"), or [Aether](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aether_(classical_element) "Aether (classical element)") as maintained by [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle#Physics "Aristotle").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics#cite_note-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics#cite_note-7) During the 17th century, natural philosophers such as [Galileo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo "Galileo"),[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics#cite_note-8)[Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descartes "Descartes"),[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics#cite_note-9) and [Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton")[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics#cite_note-10) began to maintain that the celestial and terrestrial regions were made of similar kinds of material and were subject to the same [natural laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_law "Physical law").[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics#cite_note-Burtt-11) Their challenge was that the tools had not yet been invented with which to prove these assertions.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics#cite_note-12)

For much of the nineteenth century, astronomical research was focused on the routine work of measuring the positions and computing the motions of astronomical objects.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics#cite_note-13)[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics#cite_note-14) A new astronomy, soon to be called astrophysics, began to emerge when [William Hyde Wollaston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Hyde_Wollaston "William Hyde Wollaston") and [Joseph von Fraunhofer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_von_Fraunhofer "Joseph von Fraunhofer") independently discovered that, when decomposing the light from the Sun, a multitude of [dark lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraunhofer_lines "Fraunhofer lines") (regions where there was less or no light) were observed in the [spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visible_spectrum "Visible spectrum").[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics#cite_note-15) By 1860 the physicist, [Gustav Kirchhoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav_Kirchhoff "Gustav Kirchhoff"), and the chemist, [Robert Bunsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Bunsen "Robert Bunsen"), had demonstrated that the [dark lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_spectroscopy#Absorption_spectrum "Absorption spectroscopy") in the solar spectrum corresponded to [bright lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emission_spectrum "Emission spectrum") in the spectra of known gases, specific lines corresponding to unique [chemical elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element "Chemical element").[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics#cite_note-16) Kirchhoff deduced that the dark lines in the solar spectrum are caused by [absorption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_(optics) "Absorption (optics)") by [chemical elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_elements "Chemical elements") in the Solar atmosphere.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics#cite_note-17) In this way it was proved that the chemical elements found in the Sun and stars were also found on Earth.

Among those who extended the study of solar and stellar spectra was [Norman Lockyer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Lockyer "Norman Lockyer"), who in 1868 detected radiant, as well as dark lines in solar spectra. Working with chemist [Edward Frankland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Frankland "Edward Frankland") to investigate the spectra of elements at various temperatures and pressures, he could not associate a yellow line in the solar spectrum with any known elements. He thus claimed the line represented a new element, which was called [helium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium "Helium"), after the Greek [Helios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helios "Helios"), the Sun personified.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics#cite_note-18)[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics#cite_note-19)

In 1885, [Edward C. Pickering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_C._Pickering "Edward C. Pickering") undertook an ambitious program of stellar spectral classification at [Harvard College Observatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_College_Observatory "Harvard College Observatory"), in which a team of [woman computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Computers "Harvard Computers"), notably [Williamina Fleming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williamina_Fleming "Williamina Fleming"), [Antonia Maury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonia_Maury "Antonia Maury"), and [Annie Jump Cannon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_Jump_Cannon "Annie Jump Cannon"), classified the spectra recorded on photographic plates. By 1890, a catalog of over 10,000 stars had been prepared that grouped them into thirteen spectral types. Following Pickering's vision, by 1924 Cannon expanded the [catalog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Draper_Catalogue "Henry Draper Catalogue") to nine volumes and over a quarter of a million stars, developing the [Harvard Classification Scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_classification#Harvard_spectral_classification "Stellar classification") which was accepted for worldwide use in 1922.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics#cite_note-20)

In 1895, [George Ellery Hale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Ellery_Hale "George Ellery Hale") and [James E. Keeler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_E._Keeler "James E. Keeler"), along with a group of ten associate editors from Europe and the United States,[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics#cite_note-Hale1895-21) established [_The Astrophysical Journal: An International Review of Spectroscopy and Astronomical Physics_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Astrophysical_Journal "The Astrophysical Journal").[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics#cite_note-22) It was intended that the journal would fill the gap between journals in astronomy and physics, providing a venue for publication of articles on astronomical applications of the spectroscope; on laboratory research closely allied to astronomical physics, including wavelength determinations of metallic and gaseous spectra and experiments on radiation and absorption; on theories of the Sun, Moon, planets, comets, meteors, and nebulae; and on instrumentation for telescopes and laboratories.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics#cite_note-Hale1895-21)

Around 1920, following the discovery of the [Hertzsprungâ€“Russell diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertzsprung%E2%80%93Russell_diagram "Hertzsprungâ€“Russell diagram") still used as the basis for classifying stars and their evolution, [Arthur Eddington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Eddington "Arthur Eddington") anticipated the discovery and mechanism of [nuclear fusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion "Nuclear fusion") processes in [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star "Star"), in his paper _The Internal Constitution of the Stars_.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics#cite_note-eddington-23)[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics#cite_note-eddington2-24) At that time, the source of stellar energy was a complete mystery; Eddington correctly speculated that the source was [fusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion "Nuclear fusion") of hydrogen into helium, liberating enormous energy according to Einstein's equation _E = mc 2_. This was a particularly remarkable development since at that time fusion and thermonuclear energy, and even that stars are largely composed of [hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen "Hydrogen") (see [metallicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallicity "Metallicity")), had not yet been discovered.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics#cite_note-25)

In 1925 Cecilia Helena Payne (later [Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cecilia_Payne-Gaposchkin "Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin")) wrote an influential doctoral dissertation at [Radcliffe College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radcliffe_College "Radcliffe College"), in which she applied [Saha's ionization theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saha_ionization_equation "Saha ionization equation") to stellar atmospheres to relate the spectral classes to the temperature of stars.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics#cite_note-26) Most significantly, she discovered that hydrogen and helium were the principal components of stars, not the composition of Earth. Despite Eddington's suggestion, discovery was so unexpected that her dissertation readers (including [Russell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Norris_Russell "Henry Norris Russell")) convinced her to modify the conclusion before publication. However, later research confirmed her discovery.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics#cite_note-27)[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics#cite_note-28)

By the end of the 20th century, studies of astronomical spectra had expanded to cover wavelengths extending from radio waves through optical, x-ray, and gamma wavelengths.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics#cite_note-29) In the 21st century, it further expanded to include observations based on [gravitational waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_waves "Gravitational waves").

Observational astrophysics
--------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Astrophysics&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Observational astrophysics")]

[![Image 2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/N_63A-_Chandra_and_Hubble_-_Heic0507f.tif/lossy-page1-200px-N_63A-_Chandra_and_Hubble_-_Heic0507f.tif.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:N_63A-_Chandra_and_Hubble_-_Heic0507f.tif)

Supernova remnant LMC N 63A imaged in x-ray (blue), optical (green) and radio (red) wavelengths. The X-ray glow is from material heated to about ten million degrees Celsius by a shock wave generated by the supernova explosion.

[Observational astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_astronomy "Observational astronomy") is a division of the astronomical science that is concerned with recording and interpreting data, in contrast with [theoretical astrophysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_astrophysics "Theoretical astrophysics"), which is mainly concerned with finding out the measurable implications of physical [models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(abstract) "Model (abstract)"). It is the practice of observing [celestial objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_object "Celestial object") by using [telescopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telescope "Telescope") and other astronomical apparatus.

Most astrophysical observations are made using the [electromagnetic spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum "Electromagnetic spectrum").

*   [Radio astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_astronomy "Radio astronomy") studies radiation with a [wavelength](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelength "Wavelength") greater than a few millimeters. Example areas of study are [radio waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_waves "Radio waves"), usually emitted by cold objects such as [interstellar gas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_gas "Interstellar gas") and dust clouds; the cosmic microwave background radiation which is the [redshifted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift "Redshift") light from the [Big Bang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang "Big Bang"); [pulsars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulsar "Pulsar"), which were first detected at [microwave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave "Microwave") frequencies. The study of these waves requires very large [radio telescopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_telescope "Radio telescope").
*   [Infrared astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_astronomy "Infrared astronomy") studies radiation with a wavelength that is too long to be visible to the naked eye but is shorter than radio waves. Infrared observations are usually made with telescopes similar to the familiar [optical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical "Optical") telescopes. Objects colder than stars (such as planets) are normally studied at infrared frequencies.
*   [Optical astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_astronomy "Optical astronomy") was the earliest kind of astronomy. Telescopes paired with a [charge-coupled device](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge-coupled_device "Charge-coupled device") or [spectroscopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscope "Spectroscope") are the most common instruments used. The Earth's [atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere "Atmosphere") interferes somewhat with optical observations, so [adaptive optics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_optics "Adaptive optics") and [space telescopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_telescope "Space telescope") are used to obtain the highest possible image quality. In this wavelength range, stars are highly visible, and many chemical spectra can be observed to study the chemical composition of stars, galaxies, and [nebulae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebula "Nebula").
*   [Ultraviolet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet "Ultraviolet"), [X-ray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_astronomy "X-ray astronomy") and [gamma ray astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_ray_astronomy "Gamma ray astronomy") study very energetic processes such as [binary pulsars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_pulsar "Binary pulsar"), [black holes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole "Black hole"), [magnetars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetar "Magnetar"), and many others. These kinds of radiation do not penetrate the Earth's atmosphere well. There are two methods in use to observe this part of the electromagnetic spectrumâ€”[space-based telescopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-based_telescope "Space-based telescope") and ground-based [imaging air Cherenkov telescopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaging_air_Cherenkov_telescope "Imaging air Cherenkov telescope") (IACT). Examples of [Observatories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observatory "Observatory") of the first type are [RXTE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RXTE "RXTE"), the [Chandra X-ray Observatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandra_X-ray_Observatory "Chandra X-ray Observatory") and the [Compton Gamma Ray Observatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compton_Gamma_Ray_Observatory "Compton Gamma Ray Observatory"). Examples of IACTs are the [High Energy Stereoscopic System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Energy_Stereoscopic_System "High Energy Stereoscopic System") (H.E.S.S.) and the [MAGIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAGIC_(telescope) "MAGIC (telescope)") telescope.

Other than electromagnetic radiation, few things may be observed from the Earth that originate from great distances. A few [gravitational wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_wave "Gravitational wave") observatories have been constructed, but gravitational waves are extremely difficult to detect. [Neutrino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrino "Neutrino") observatories have also been built, primarily to study the Sun. Cosmic rays consisting of very high-energy particles can be observed hitting the Earth's atmosphere.

Observations can also vary in their time scale. Most optical observations take minutes to hours, so phenomena that change faster than this cannot readily be observed. However, historical data on some objects is available, spanning [centuries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century "Century") or [millennia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennia "Millennia"). On the other hand, radio observations may look at events on a millisecond timescale ([millisecond pulsars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millisecond_pulsar "Millisecond pulsar")) or combine years of data ([pulsar deceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation-powered_pulsar "Rotation-powered pulsar") studies). The information obtained from these different timescales is very different.

The study of the Sun has a special place in observational astrophysics. Due to the tremendous distance of all other stars, the Sun can be observed in a kind of detail unparalleled by any other star. Understanding the Sun serves as a guide to understanding of other stars.

The topic of how stars change, or stellar evolution, is often modeled by placing the varieties of star types in their respective positions on the [Hertzsprungâ€“Russell diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertzsprung%E2%80%93Russell_diagram "Hertzsprungâ€“Russell diagram"), which can be viewed as representing the state of a stellar object, from birth to destruction.

Theoretical astrophysics
------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Astrophysics&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Theoretical astrophysics")]

Theoretical astrophysicists use a wide variety of tools which include [analytical models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model "Mathematical model") (for example, [polytropes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytrope "Polytrope") to approximate the behaviors of a star) and [computational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computation "Computation")[numerical simulations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_analysis "Numerical analysis"). Each has some advantages. Analytical models of a process are generally better for giving insight into the heart of what is going on. Numerical models can reveal the existence of phenomena and effects that would otherwise not be seen.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics#cite_note-30)[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics#cite_note-31)

Theorists in astrophysics endeavor to create theoretical models and figure out the observational consequences of those models. This helps allow observers to look for data that can refute a model or help in choosing between several alternate or conflicting models.

Theorists also try to generate or modify models to take into account new data. In the case of an inconsistency, the general tendency is to try to make minimal modifications to the model to fit the data. In some cases, a large amount of inconsistent data over time may lead to total abandonment of a model.

Topics studied by theoretical astrophysicists include stellar dynamics and evolution; galaxy formation and evolution; magnetohydrodynamics; large-scale structure of matter in the universe; origin of cosmic rays; general relativity and physical cosmology, including [string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory "String theory") cosmology and astroparticle physics. Relativistic astrophysics serves as a tool to gauge the properties of large-scale structures for which gravitation plays a significant role in physical phenomena investigated and as the basis for [black hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole "Black hole") (_astro_)physics and the study of [gravitational waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_waves "Gravitational waves").

Some widely accepted and studied theories and models in astrophysics, now included in the [Lambda-CDM model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda-CDM_model "Lambda-CDM model"), are the [Big Bang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang "Big Bang"), [cosmic inflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_inflation "Cosmic inflation"), dark matter, dark energy and fundamental theories of physics.

The roots of astrophysics can be found in the seventeenth century emergence of a unified physics, in which the same laws applied to the celestial and terrestrial realms.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics#cite_note-Burtt-11) There were scientists who were qualified in both physics and astronomy who laid the firm foundation for the current science of astrophysics. In modern times, students continue to be drawn to astrophysics due to its popularization by the [Royal Astronomical Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Astronomical_Society "Royal Astronomical Society") and notable [educators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_education "Science education") such as prominent professors [Lawrence Krauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Krauss "Lawrence Krauss"), [Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subrahmanyan_Chandrasekhar "Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar"), [Stephen Hawking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hawking "Stephen Hawking"), [Hubert Reeves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_Reeves "Hubert Reeves"), [Carl Sagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan "Carl Sagan") and [Patrick Moore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Moore "Patrick Moore"). The efforts of the early, late, and present scientists continue to attract young people to study the history and science of astrophysics.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics#cite_note-32)[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics#cite_note-33)[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics#cite_note-34) The television sitcom show _[The Big Bang Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Big\_Bang\_Theory "The Big Bang Theory")_ popularized the field of astrophysics with the general public, and featured some well known scientists like [Stephen Hawking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hawking "Stephen Hawking") and [Neil deGrasse Tyson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson "Neil deGrasse Tyson").

Eddington had realized that there would be a mass loss if four hydrogen atoms combined to form a single helium atom. Einstein's equivalence of mass and energy led directly to the suggestion that this could be the long-sought process that produces the energy in the stars! It was an inspired guess, all the more remarkable because the structure of the nucleus and the mechanisms of these reactions were not fully understood.
