[ 2 ] His only surviving work is the Harmonika (Greek: Ἁρμονικά), which is a three-volume codification of Byzantine musical scholarship based on the classical Greek works of Ptolemy , Nicomachus , and the Neopythagorean authors on the numerological theory of music .

[ 2 ] One of Bryennios's students was Theodore Metochites , the grand logothete during the reign of Emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos (r. 1272–1328).

[ 2 ] Metochites studied astronomy under Bryennios.
