( Learn how and when to remove these messages ) This article is missing information about space, time, and their modelling with manifolds. It mixes derivatives along a curve with covariant derivatives in a spacetime manifold.

Please expand the article to include this information. Further details may exist on the talk page .

( January 2025 ) This article needs attention from an expert in mathematics . The specific problem is: Confusion of covariant derivatives along a curve and covariant derivatives in a spacetime manifold. Missing relation of a curve parameter to the specific notion of time.

( January 2025 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) In mathematics and physics , acceleration is the rate of change of velocity of a curve with respect to a given linear connection . This operation provides us with a measure of the rate and direction of the "bend".

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Formal definition [ edit ] Let be given a differentiable manifold M {\displaystyle M} , considered as spacetime (not only space), with a connection Γ Γ {\displaystyle \Gamma } . Let γ γ : : R → → M {\displaystyle \gamma \colon \mathbb {R} \to M} be a curve in M {\displaystyle M} with tangent vector , i.e. (spacetime) velocity, γ γ ˙ ˙ ( τ τ ) {\displaystyle {\dot {\gamma }}(\tau )} , with parameter τ τ {\displaystyle \tau } .

The (spacetime) acceleration vector of γ γ {\displaystyle \gamma } is defined by ∇ ∇ γ γ ˙ ˙ γ γ ˙ ˙ {\displaystyle \nabla _{\dot {\gamma }}{\dot {\gamma }}} , where ∇ ∇ {\displaystyle \nabla } denotes the covariant derivative associated to Γ Γ {\displaystyle \Gamma } .

It is a covariant derivative along γ γ {\displaystyle \gamma } , and it is often denoted by ∇ ∇ γ γ ˙ ˙ γ γ ˙ ˙ = ∇ ∇ γ γ ˙ ˙ d τ τ .

{\displaystyle \nabla _{\dot {\gamma }}{\dot {\gamma }}={\frac {\nabla {\dot {\gamma }}}{d\tau }}.} With respect to an arbitrary coordinate system ( x μ μ ) {\displaystyle (x^{\mu })} , and with ( Γ Γ λ λ μ μ ν ν ) {\displaystyle (\Gamma ^{\lambda }{}_{\mu \nu })} being the components of the connection (i.e., covariant derivative ∇ ∇ μ μ := ∇ ∇ ∂ ∂ / ∂ ∂ x μ μ {\displaystyle \nabla _{\mu }:=\nabla _{\partial /\partial x^{\mu }}} ) relative to this coordinate system, defined by ∇ ∇ ∂ ∂ / ∂ ∂ x μ μ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ x ν ν = Γ Γ λ λ μ μ ν ν ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ x λ λ , {\displaystyle \nabla _{\partial /\partial x^{\mu }}{\frac {\partial }{\partial x^{\nu }}}=\Gamma ^{\lambda }{}_{\mu \nu }{\frac {\partial }{\partial x^{\lambda }}},} for the acceleration vector field a μ μ := ( ∇ ∇ γ γ ˙ ˙ γ γ ˙ ˙ ) μ μ {\displaystyle a^{\mu }:=(\nabla _{\dot {\gamma }}{\dot {\gamma }})^{\mu }} one gets: a μ μ = v ρ ρ ∇ ∇ ρ ρ v μ μ = d v μ μ d τ τ + Γ Γ μ μ ν ν λ λ v ν ν v λ λ = d 2 x μ μ d τ τ 2 + Γ Γ μ μ ν ν λ λ d x ν ν d τ τ d x λ λ d τ τ , {\displaystyle a^{\mu }=v^{\rho }\nabla _{\rho }v^{\mu }={\frac {dv^{\mu }}{d\tau }}+\Gamma ^{\mu }{}_{\nu \lambda }v^{\nu }v^{\lambda }={\frac {d^{2}x^{\mu }}{d\tau ^{2}}}+\Gamma ^{\mu }{}_{\nu \lambda }{\frac {dx^{\nu }}{d\tau }}{\frac {dx^{\lambda }}{d\tau }},} where x μ μ ( τ τ ) := γ γ μ μ ( τ τ ) {\displaystyle x^{\mu }(\tau ):=\gamma ^{\mu }(\tau )} is the local expression for the path γ γ {\displaystyle \gamma } , and v ρ ρ := ( γ γ ˙ ˙ ) ρ ρ {\displaystyle v^{\rho }:=({\dot {\gamma }})^{\rho }} .

The concept of acceleration is a covariant derivative concept. In other words, in order to define acceleration an additional structure on M {\displaystyle M} must be given.

Using abstract index notation , the acceleration of a given curve with unit tangent vector ξ ξ a {\displaystyle \xi ^{a}} is given by ξ ξ b ∇ ∇ b ξ ξ a {\displaystyle \xi ^{b}\nabla _{b}\xi ^{a}} .
