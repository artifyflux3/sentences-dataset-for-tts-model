Representation of the gravitational field of Earth and Moon combined (not to scale). Vector field (blue) and its associated scalar potential field (red). Point P between earth and moon is the [point of equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_of_equilibrium "Point of equilibrium").

In [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics"), a **gravitational field** or **gravitational acceleration field** is a [vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_field "Vector field")[field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(physics) "Field (physics)") used to explain the influences that a body extends into the space around itself.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_field#cite_note-1) A gravitational field is used to explain [gravitational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity "Gravity") phenomena, such as the _[gravitational force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational\_force "Gravitational force") field_ exerted on another massive body. It has [dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension_(physics) "Dimension (physics)") of [acceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration "Acceleration") (L/T 2) and it is measured in [units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_of_measurement "Unit of measurement") of [newtons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_(unit) "Newton (unit)") per [kilogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram "Kilogram") (N/kg) or, equivalently, in [meters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meter "Meter") per [second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second "Second") squared (m/s 2).

In its original concept, [gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity "Gravity") was a [force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force "Force") between point [masses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass "Mass"). Following [Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton"), [Pierre-Simon Laplace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Simon_Laplace "Pierre-Simon Laplace") attempted to model gravity as some kind of [radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation "Radiation") field or [fluid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid "Fluid"),[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] and since the 19th century, explanations for gravity in [classical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics "Classical mechanics") have usually been taught in terms of a field model, rather than a point attraction. It results from the [spatial gradient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_gradient "Spatial gradient") of the [gravitational potential field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_potential_field "Gravitational potential field").

In [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity"), rather than two particles attracting each other, the particles distort [spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime "Spacetime") via their mass, and this distortion is what is perceived and measured as a "force".[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] In such a model one states that matter moves in certain ways in response to the curvature of spacetime,[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_field#cite_note-2) and that there is either _no gravitational force_,[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_field#cite_note-3) or that gravity is a [fictitious force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictitious_force "Fictitious force").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_field#cite_note-4)

Gravity is distinguished from other forces by its obedience to the [equivalence principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_principle "Equivalence principle").

Classical mechanics
-------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gravitational_field&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Classical mechanics")]

In classical mechanics, a gravitational field is a physical quantity.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_field#cite_note-5) A gravitational field can be defined using [Newton's law of universal gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation "Newton's law of universal gravitation"). Determined in this way, the gravitational field **g** around a single particle of mass _M_ is a [vector field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_field "Vector field") consisting at every point of a [vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(geometry) "Vector (geometry)") pointing directly towards the particle. The magnitude of the field at every point is calculated by applying the universal law, and represents the force per unit mass on any object at that point in space. Because the force field is conservative, there is a scalar potential energy per unit mass, Φ, at each point in space associated with the force fields; this is called [gravitational potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_potential "Gravitational potential").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_field#cite_note-6) The gravitational field equation is[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_field#cite_note-7)![Image 2: {\displaystyle \mathbf {g} ={\frac {\mathbf {F} }{m}}={\frac {d^{2}\mathbf {R} }{dt^{2}}}=-GM{\frac {\mathbf {R} }{\left|\mathbf {R} \right|^{3}}}=-\nabla \Phi ,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/029300de8f2e98cc0b62b6e66eb1bbbebeff26be) where **F** is the [gravitational force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_force "Gravitational force"), _m_ is the mass of the [test particle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_mass "Test mass"), **R** is the radial vector of the test particle relative to the mass (or for Newton's second law of motion which is a time dependent function, a set of positions of test particles each occupying a particular point in space for the start of testing), _t_ is [time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time "Time"), _G_ is the [gravitational constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_constant "Gravitational constant"), and ∇ is the [del operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Del_operator "Del operator").

This includes Newton's law of universal gravitation, and the relation between gravitational potential and field acceleration. ⁠d 2**R**/d _t_ 2⁠ and ⁠**F**/_m_⁠ are both equal to the [gravitational acceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_acceleration "Gravitational acceleration")**g** (equivalent to the inertial acceleration, so same mathematical form, but also defined as gravitational force per unit mass[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_field#cite_note-8)). The negative signs are inserted since the force acts antiparallel to the displacement. The equivalent field equation in terms of mass [density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density "Density")_ρ_ of the attracting mass is: ![Image 3: {\displaystyle \nabla \cdot \mathbf {g} =-\nabla ^{2}\Phi =-4\pi G\rho }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/aa9cc95884f5565a76f6710706f45917d6784c9d) which contains [Gauss's law for gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%27s_law_for_gravity "Gauss's law for gravity"), and [Poisson's equation for gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson%27s_equation#Newtonian_gravity "Poisson's equation"). Newton's law implies Gauss's law, but not vice versa; see _[Relation between Gauss's and Newton's laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%27s\_law\_for\_gravity#Relation\_to\_Newton's\_law "Gauss's law for gravity")_.

These classical equations are [differential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation "Differential equation")[equations of motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equations_of_motion "Equations of motion") for a [test particle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_particle "Test particle") in the presence of a gravitational field, i.e. setting up and solving these equations allows the motion of a test mass to be determined and described.

The field around multiple particles is simply the [vector sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(geometry)#Addition_and_subtraction "Vector (geometry)") of the fields around each individual particle. A test particle in such a field will experience a force that equals the vector sum of the forces that it would experience in these individual fields. This is[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_field#cite_note-9)![Image 4: {\displaystyle \mathbf {g} =\sum _{i}\mathbf {g} _{i}={\frac {1}{m}}\sum _{i}\mathbf {F} _{i}=-G\sum _{i}m_{i}{\frac {\mathbf {R} -\mathbf {R} _{i}}{\left|\mathbf {R} -\mathbf {R} _{i}\right|^{3}}}=-\sum _{i}\nabla \Phi _{i},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bbd87d03586d84e42d1cd561d5bb45153d1c8db2) i.e. the gravitational field on mass _m j_ is the sum of all gravitational fields due to all other masses _m_ _i_, except the mass _m j_ itself. **R**_i_ is the position vector of the gravitating particle _i_, and **R** is that of the test particle.

A freely moving particle in gravitational field has the equations of motion: ![Image 5: {\displaystyle {\frac {d^{2}x^{\lambda }}{d\tau ^{2}}}+\Gamma _{\mu \nu }^{\lambda }{\frac {dx^{\mu }}{d\tau }}{\frac {dx^{\nu }}{d\tau }}=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/72fff4533e580de6b245546430a574238003b4ff) where ![Image 6: {\displaystyle \tau }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/38a7dcde9730ef0853809fefc18d88771f95206c) is the [proper time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_time "Proper time") for the particle, ![Image 7: {\displaystyle \Gamma _{\mu \nu }^{\lambda }}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b2ed711a5120b51b00a8bb4bdd696b6f38655ee2) are the [Christoffel symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christoffel_symbols "Christoffel symbols") and repeated indices are summed over.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_field#cite_note-Weinberg-1972-10): 70  The proper time can be expressed in terms of the [metric tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_tensor "Metric tensor"): ![Image 8: {\displaystyle d\tau ^{2}=-g_{\mu \nu }dx^{\mu }dx^{\nu }.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f0829f8694e4eb8058f4a2d4903075878dfaff7a) The field that determines the gravitational force is the [Christoffel symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christoffel_symbols "Christoffel symbols") and its derivatives, the [metric tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_tensor_(general_relativity) "Metric tensor (general relativity)") plays the role of the gravitational potential.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_field#cite_note-Weinberg-1972-10): 73

In general relativity, the gravitational field is determined by solving the [Einstein field equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_field_equations "Einstein field equations")[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_field#cite_note-Weinberg-1972-10): 157 ![Image 9: {\displaystyle \mathbf {G} =\kappa \mathbf {T} ,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2525a5216d0ff58f064aa3f0b926c05e3d04481a) where **T** is the [stress–energy tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress%E2%80%93energy_tensor "Stress–energy tensor"), **G** is the [Einstein tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_tensor "Einstein tensor"), and _κ_ is the [Einstein gravitational constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_gravitational_constant "Einstein gravitational constant"). The latter is defined as _κ_ = 8 _πG_/_c_ 4, where _G_ is the [Newtonian constant of gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newtonian_constant_of_gravitation "Newtonian constant of gravitation") and _c_ is the [speed of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light "Speed of light").

These equations are dependent on the distribution of matter, stress and momentum in a region of space, unlike Newtonian gravity, which is depends on only the distribution of matter. The fields themselves in general relativity represent the curvature of spacetime. General relativity states that being in a region of curved space is [equivalent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_principle#Einstein_equivalence_principle "Equivalence principle") to [accelerating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration "Acceleration") up the [gradient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient "Gradient") of the field. By [Newton's second law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion#Newton's_second_law "Newton's laws of motion"), this will cause an object to experience a [fictitious force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictitious_force "Fictitious force") if it is held still with respect to the field. This is why a person will feel himself pulled down by the force of gravity while standing still on the Earth's surface. In general the gravitational fields predicted by general relativity differ in their effects only slightly from those predicted by classical mechanics, but there are a number of easily verifiable [differences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity#Consequences_of_Einstein's_theory "General relativity"), one of the most well known being the [deflection of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity#Light_deflection_and_gravitational_time_delay "General relativity") in such fields.

**Embedding diagrams** are three dimensional graphs commonly used to educationally illustrate gravitational potential by drawing gravitational potential fields as a gravitational topography, depicting the potentials as so-called **gravitational wells**, [sphere of influence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere_of_influence_(astrodynamics) "Sphere of influence (astrodynamics)").
