[ 12 ] [ 13 ] In a 2018 interview, the foundation's CEO, Richard Graber , described its four major areas of funding as "constitutional order", education (in particular school choice ), civil society , and arts and culture.

[ 3 ] In that interview, Graber said that the foundation would deemphasize some areas in which it had previously made grants, including national security and foreign policy.

[ 3 ] Between 2008 and 2011, Bradley contributed to the David Horowitz Freedom Center ($4.2 million), the Center for Security Policy ($815,000) and the Middle East Forum ($305,000).

[ 14 ] The Bradley Foundation is a major funder of state-level initiatives opposing public sector unions, particularly in Wisconsin.
