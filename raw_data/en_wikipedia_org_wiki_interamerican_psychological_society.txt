Penagos-Corzo Website sipsych .org The Interamerican Society of Psychology is the scientific and professional society that brings together the psychologists of the Americas. It is more commonly known by its Spanish title Sociedad Interamericana de Psicología ( SIP ). It is also known by its French title Société Interaméricaine de Psychologie .

The organization's official languages are Spanish, English, Portuguese, and French.

[ 1 ] The main objective of the SIP is to promote the exchange among psychologists of the Americas. The SIP has been recognized as a driving force for the growth of psychology in Latin America, and has facilitated the formation of other institutions, such as the International Association for Cross-Cultural Psychology (IACCP), the Latin American Association for Behavior Analysis and Modification (ALAMOC) or the Latin American Association of Social Psychology (ALAPSO). In order to achieve the central objective, three specific objectives were proposed: [ 2 ] To provide a means of direct communication among psychologists and scientists in related fields in North, Central and South America and the Caribbean, and to promote the development of the behavioral sciences in the Western Hemisphere.

To contribute to international understanding through a broader understanding of cultural differences and encounters across national boundaries.

To help promote research and academic and professional exchange among the nations of the Americas.

Among its activities are the Interamerican Journal of Psychology, which accepts papers pertaining to any area of psychology and in the official languages of the SIP, which are Spanish, English, Portuguese and French; the Interamerican Congress of Psychology, which is held in different American countries and promotes the exchange of information on psychology or related topics; and the Regional Congress, which facilitates access to information for people who could not attend the Interamerican congresses, but on a regional basis. In addition, the SIP awards a student prize for the best research in psychology at the undergraduate and graduate levels to promote scientific research among students.

[ 2 ] Every two years the SIP hosts the Interamerican Congress of Psychology (CIP) and the Regional Congress of Psychology (CR-SIP).

[ 3 ] Their first Interamerican Congress was celebrated in 1953 in Santo Domingo , Dominican Republic .

[ 4 ] History [ edit ] It was founded in Mexico City in 1951 [ 4 ] by a group of psychologists and psychiatrists including Eduardo Krapf, Werner Wolff, Oswaldo Robles, Jaime Barrios Peña, Rogelio Díaz-Guerrero, among others. The founders had attended the IV World Congress on Mental Health held at the facilities of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and at the Palace of Fine Arts in December of that same year.

[ 5 ] The SIP is a member of the International Union of Psychological Science (IUPsyS), a division of the International Council of Scientific Unions , which allows it to relate to international organizations such as UNESCO .

[ 2 ] Since 1953, the SIP has organized Inter-American Congresses.

[ 6 ] The first one was held in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, from December 10 to 20, 1953, with the central theme “Cultures and Values in Psychology”, [ 7 ] organized by Andrés Avelino García, with a registered attendance of 50 people. Currently, these congresses are held every two years and are of a generalist nature, insofar as they cover the main manifestations of the discipline. In addition to the Inter-American Congresses, since 2004, the Regional Congresses have been organized. The first one has taken place in Guatemala and the last one happened in June of 2024 in Arequipa, Peru.

[ 3 ] Other relevant facts about the history of the SIP are the following: Since 1967, the Interamerican Journal of Psychology has been published, which publishes both theoretical and applied articles.

The Interamerican Student Award was created in 1991 and was given to undergraduate and graduate students.

[ 8 ] Since 2007, to honor one of the SIP’s pioneers, it has been decided to rename the Interamerican Psychology Award for Hispanic and Portuguese speakers after Rogelio Díaz Guerrero.

[ 8 ] Some of the main personalities who have been part of the SIP’s General Committee are Martín-Baró, Rogelio Díaz Guerrero, Rubén Ardila, Harry Triandis, Isabel Lagunes, Aroldo Rodrigues and José Miguel Salazar, among others.

[ 24 ] XL 14 to 18 of july, 2025 San Juan, Puerto Rico Organizer: Antonio Puente Theme: A Psychology for all the Americas SIP Structure [ edit ] The SIP is centered in a Central Office where the main exchange of information regarding research, publications and opportunities related to psychology in the Americas takes place. The board of directors consists of the following officers: president, vice-president, executive secretaries, secretary general, treasurer, editor of the RIP, coordinator of the publishing imprint and student representative; in addition there are the president-elect and the outgoing president.

[ 25 ] Officers are elected by a vote of the entire membership. However, there are three positions that are not subject to voting. On the one hand, the secretaries are elected by the president; on the other hand, the two positions responsible for the imprint, i.e., the imprint coordinator and the editor of the RIP, are elected by an Ad Hoc committee appointed by the board, the committee evaluates, elects and decides, and the board rectifies. The positions have a duration of two years, [ 26 ] with the exception of the positions responsible for the imprint, which last four years. The presidencies rotate by region (North America, Central America and South America), so that every six years the presidency is re-elected in the same region. In addition, the SIP has National Representatives and Delegates for each country in each region of the Americas, who serve as a liaison network with the Central Office.

[ 2 ] Task Forces [ edit ] The Task Forces are another important area of development of the Society, in which its members, grouped by expertise, seek to promote areas of Psychology. Some of these are: [ 27 ] History of Psychology Community Psychology Environmantal Psychology Clinical Psychology Rights, DIsability and Rare Diseases Psychology of Sports Psychology of Sexual Diversity Editors Educational Psychology Group of students Training in Psychology Ethics Assessment Experimental and Comparative Psychology Osychology of Gender Legal Psychology Policy Psychology Psychology of Health Organizational Psychology Violence, prevention and resilience Publications [ edit ] Interamerican Journal of Psychology [ edit ] The SIP publishes the Interamerican Journal of Psychology since 1967 with the purpose of reflecting the discoveries that are being carried out in the American continent, covering theory and practice. In this way, it seeks to promote both collaboration and communication among psychologists of the continent. The journal is published three times a year and in any official language of the SIP.

[ 28 ] The journal has single-blind peer review arbitration.

[ 29 ] It has a plagiarism detection system and abides by certain limitations in its publications since only a maximum of two articles can be processed with the participation of the same author and each author can only indicate one institution of affiliation for the signature of the articles, the other institutions must be listed in the author's note as other financing institutions. It also has a policy of open and immediate access to its content, since it is based on the principle that making research freely available to the public favors a greater global exchange of knowledge. In turn, it offers researchers the possibility of publishing their work free of charge.

[ 30 ] The journal also has a policy of open and immediate access to its content.

In 2017 [ 31 ] a socio-bibliometric study was conducted on the first 50 publications of the journal in which its structure was observed and a citation concentration analysis and a conceptual analysis were performed. It was found that the structure up to that time was characterized by both diversity and frequent changes in its staff and scientific committee. In relation to the citation concentration analysis, the results showed that most of the articles and books referenced were mainly American on topics such as locus of control, social learning, and cross-cultural, social and community psychology. In addition, the central concepts were related to behavior and cognition, analyzed from experimental and psychometric methods based on American social psychology.

In the same year, a roadmap was drawn up to analyze the role of the journal in terms of trends in its publication, collaboration, use, and to draw its Editorial Effort Index and Internationalization Index. It was found that it had high standards of internationalization during the period analyzed, which was from 2005 to 2015.

[ 32 ] SIP Bulletin [ edit ] The SIP Bulletin is developed by members of the Board of Directors to highlight the work carried out by its members and thus maintain a link between the SIP and its membership. It is published at least once a year, although more than one bulletin may be published in a year [ 33 ] and currently has 114 issues.
