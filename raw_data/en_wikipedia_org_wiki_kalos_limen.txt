'Charming Harbor'; Ukrainian : Калос-Лімен ; Russian : Калос Лимен ) is an ancient Greek colony on the west coast of the Crimean Peninsula that existed from 4th to 1st centuries BC.

[ 1 ] History [ edit ] The settlement is mentioned in the anonymous Periplus of the Euxine Sea [ uk ] as being located 700 stadions from Kerkinitis (modern-day Yevpatoria ). Based on the descriptions from the periplus , it was concluded that Kalos Limen was located on the coast of Tarkhankut Peninsula .

[ 2 ] Kalos Limen was established by Ionian settlers in 4th century BC. The city was 4 ha in size and was surrounded by walls. Kalos Limen was divided into sections, and a tower was located in the center of each. By the end of 4th century BC, the city belonged to Chersonesus . Fortifications of the city were strengthened in 3rd century BC due to Scythian and Sarmatian raids.

[ 2 ] In 2nd century BC, Kalos Limen was captured by Scythians, [ 3 ] but it was soon recaptured by Greeks, to be recaptured by Scythians again.

[ 2 ] In 1st century BC, the city was abandoned completely due to a Sarmatian invasion.

[ 3 ] On 22 April 1997, the State Historic-Archaeological Preserve "Kalos-Limen" was created.
