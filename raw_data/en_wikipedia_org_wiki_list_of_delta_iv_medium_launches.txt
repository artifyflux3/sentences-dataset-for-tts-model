Its last flight was with a 3rd generation GPS satellite in August 2019.

Delta IV Medium configurations [ edit ] The Delta IV Medium (also referred to as 'single stick' [ 1 ] [ 2 ] ) was available in four configurations: Medium, Medium+ (4,2), Medium+ (5,2), and Medium+ (5,4).

[ 3 ] Delta IV Medium , coded Delta 9040 , was the most basic Delta IV. It featured a single CBC and a modified Delta 3 second stage, with 4-meter liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen tanks (called a Delta Cryogenic Second Stage (DCSS)) and a 4-meter payload fairing . The Delta IV Medium was capable of launching 4,200 kg to geostationary transfer orbit (GTO). From Cape Canaveral, GTO is 1804 m/s away from GEO. The mass of fairing and payload attach fittings have been subtracted from the gross performance.

[ 4 ] Delta IV Medium+ (4,2) , coded Delta 9240 , had the same CBC and DCSS as the Medium, but with the addition of two Orbital ATK -built 1.5-m (60-in) diameter solid rocket booster Graphite-Epoxy Motors (GEM-60s) strap-on boosters to increase payload capacity to 6,150 kg to GTO.

[ 4 ] Delta IV Medium+ (5,2) , coded Delta 9250 , was similar to the Medium+ (4,2), but had a 5-m–diameter DCSS and payload fairing for larger payloads. Because of the extra weight of the larger payload fairing and second stage, the Medium+ (5,2) could launch 5,072 kg to GTO.

[ 4 ] Delta IV Medium+ (5,4) , coded Delta 9450 , was similar to the Medium+ (5,2), but used four GEM-60s instead of two, enabling it to lift 6,882 kg to GTO.

[ 4 ] To encapsulate the satellite payload, a variety of different payload fairings were available. A stretched Delta III 4-meter diameter composite payload fairing was used on 4-meter Medium versions, while an enlarged, 5-meter diameter composite fairing was used on 5-meter Medium versions.

The Medium (4,2) version last flew on 22 August 2019, marking the retirement of the Delta IV Medium variants.
