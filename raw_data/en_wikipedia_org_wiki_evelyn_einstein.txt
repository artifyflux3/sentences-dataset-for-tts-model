[ 1 ] [ 2 ] She graduated from University of California, Berkeley with a master's degree in literature, and had several jobs in her life including animal control officer , cult deprogrammer , and reserve police officer in Berkeley, California .

[ 1 ] Biography [ edit ] Einstein was born in Chicago ; after her birth she was adopted by Hans Albert Einstein . Towards the end of her life, she asserted that she was an illegitimate daughter of Albert Einstein and a ballet dancer; however, she had no documentation supporting this claim.

[ 3 ] She obtained a Master's degree in Medieval literature at University of California, Berkeley . She was married to Grover Krantz for 13 years from 1964 to about 1977. She then worked briefly as an animal control officer , as a cult deprogrammer , and as a Berkeley, California, reserve police officer .

As an 18-year-old college student in 1960, Einstein was the only [ 4 ] person with a recognized name among the dozens of people arrested in San Francisco at a peaceful protest against the House Un-American Activities Committee .

[ 3 ] After her divorce, she stated that she was impoverished.

[ 3 ] She claims that she was homeless, she slept in cars, scrounged for discarded food and described herself as a dumpster-diver for three months.

[ 5 ] From the mid-1990s up to her death in 2011, she lived in her own townhouse in Albany, California [ 3 ] with a view of the San Francisco Bay.

[ citation needed ] Evelyn told CNN she was outraged she had not received a dime out of the millions of dollars earned annually from her grandfather's likeness, with all profits going to Hebrew University of Jerusalem . While Albert Einstein bestowed the literary rights for the more than 75,000 papers and other items in his estate, Evelyn asked "What does a bobblehead have to do with a literary estate?" adding "It's hard for me to believe they would treat the family the way they have, which has been abysmally." [ 6 ] In 1996 she sued the trustee in charge of a collection of correspondence between Albert and Mileva Einstein , a suit that was settled privately.

[ 3 ] She left her entire estate valued over a million dollars to attorney Allen P. Wilkinson.
