Scientific career Fields Mathematics Institutions University of Konstanz , University of Tübingen , Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität, Bonn Doctoral advisor Guido Hoheisel Arnold Schönhage (born 1 December 1934 in Lockhausen , now Bad Salzuflen ) is a German mathematician and computer scientist .

Schönhage was professor at the Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität, Bonn , [ 1 ] and also in Tübingen and Konstanz .

[ 2 ] Together with Volker Strassen , he developed the Schönhage–Strassen algorithm for the multiplication of large numbers [ 1 ] [ 3 ] that has a runtime of O ( N log N log log N ). For many years, this was the fastest way to multiply large integers, although Schönhage and Strassen predicted that an algorithm with a run-time of N(logN) should exist. In 2019, Joris van der Hoeven and David Harvey finally developed an algorithm with this runtime, proving that Schönhage's and Strassen's prediction had been correct.

[ 4 ] Schönhage designed and implemented together with Andreas F. W. Grotefeld and Ekkehart Vetter a multitape Turing machine , called TP , in software. The machine is programmed in TPAL , an assembler language . They implemented numerous numerical algorithms, including the Schönhage–Strassen algorithm, on this machine.

The Odlyzko–Schönhage algorithm [ 5 ] from 1988 is regularly used in research on the Riemann zeta function .
