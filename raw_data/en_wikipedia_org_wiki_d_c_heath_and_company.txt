D.C. Heath and Co., founded by Edwin Ginn Daniel Collamore Heath Status Defunct Founded 1885 Founder Daniel Collamore Heath Successor Houghton Mifflin Country of origin United States Headquarters location Lexington, Massachusetts Publication types Textbooks D. C. Heath and Company was an American publishing company specializing in textbooks.

[ 1 ] It was founded in 1885 in Boston by Edwin Ginn and Daniel Collamore Heath [ 2 ] and was later located at 125 Spring Street in Lexington, Massachusetts .

[ 3 ] From 1966 to 1995 the firm was owned by Raytheon . When Raytheon exited the textbook market, it sold the company to Houghton Mifflin .

History [ edit ] 19th century [ edit ] One of the firm's founders, Daniel Collamore Heath, stated that he had founded the company "for the purpose of providing tools for the new education".

[ 1 ] 1980s [ edit ] D.C. Heath started a small division of software editors to supplement the textbooks in the early 1980s. The editors strove to make the software packages independent of the books. (Note-these editors were former teachers) There were test banks that allowed teachers to pick and choose questions for their quizzes and tests. Development was further supported to enable teachers to create their own questions including a formula editor, tagging items by objectives, and including custom graphics in the question as well as in the answer key. This was for the Apple 2 then later Windows and Macintoshes. Many titles were commissioned for the areas of science, math, reading, social studies, and modern languages. These were interactive original programs. D.C. Heath gave this group their own identity, Collamore Educational Publishing. The editors were involved in all facets of the publishing process including contracts, development, design, publishing, marketing, and sales. Schools were just transitioning from the one computer classroom to the computer lab. In 1988 most of the software was being supported by William K. Bradford Publishing Company composed initially by D. C. Heath / Collamore personnel.
