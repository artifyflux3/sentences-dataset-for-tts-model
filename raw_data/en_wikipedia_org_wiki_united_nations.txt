The **United Nations** (**UN**) is the [global](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth")[intergovernmental organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intergovernmental_organization "Intergovernmental organization") established by the signing of the [UN Charter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter_of_the_United_Nations "Charter of the United Nations") on 26 June 1945 with the articulated mission of maintaining [international peace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_peace "International peace") and [security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_security "International security"), to develop friendly [relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy "Diplomacy") among [states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(polity) "State (polity)"), to promote international cooperation, and to serve as a centre for harmonizing the actions of states in achieving those goals.

The [United Nations headquarters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_headquarters "United Nations headquarters") is located in [New York City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City "New York City"), with several other offices located in [Geneva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Office_at_Geneva "United Nations Office at Geneva"), [Nairobi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Office_at_Nairobi "United Nations Office at Nairobi"), [Vienna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Office_at_Vienna "United Nations Office at Vienna"), and [The Hague](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hague "The Hague"). The UN comprises six principal organizations: the [General Assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly "United Nations General Assembly"), the [Security Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council "United Nations Security Council"), the [Economic and Social Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Economic_and_Social_Council "United Nations Economic and Social Council"), the [International Court of Justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Court_of_Justice "International Court of Justice"), the [Secretariat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Secretariat "United Nations Secretariat"), and the [Trusteeship Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Trusteeship_Council "United Nations Trusteeship Council") which, together with several [specialized agencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_specialized_agencies_of_the_United_Nations "List of specialized agencies of the United Nations") and related agencies, make up the [United Nations System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_System "United Nations System"). There are in total 193 [member states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_states_of_the_United_Nations "Member states of the United Nations") and 2 [observer states.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_observers "United Nations General Assembly observers")

The UN has primarily focused on economic and social development, particularly during the wave of [decolonization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decolonization "Decolonization") in the mid-20th century. The UN has been praised as a leader of peace and human development, with many officers and agencies having been awarded the [Nobel Peace Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Peace_Prize "Nobel Peace Prize"), but has also been [criticized for perceived ineffectiveness, bias, and corruption.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_United_Nations "Criticism of the United Nations")

History
-------

### Background (pre-1941)

[![Image 5](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/Emperor_Haile_Selassie_League_of_Nations_speech.png/250px-Emperor_Haile_Selassie_League_of_Nations_speech.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Emperor_Haile_Selassie_League_of_Nations_speech.png)

[Haile Selassie I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haile_Selassie "Haile Selassie") at the [League of Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Nations "League of Nations") appealing Italy's invasion in 1936 which the League failed to intervene.

In the century prior to the UN's creation, several [international organizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_organization "International organization") such as the [International Committee of the Red Cross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Committee_of_the_Red_Cross "International Committee of the Red Cross") were formed to ensure protection and assistance for victims of armed conflict and strife.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-2)

During [World War I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I "World War I"), several major leaders, especially [U.S. president](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States "President of the United States")[Woodrow Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy_of_the_Woodrow_Wilson_administration "Foreign policy of the Woodrow Wilson administration"), advocated for a world body to guarantee peace. The winners of the war, the [Allies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_I "Allies of World War I"), met to decide on formal peace terms at the [Paris Peace Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Peace_Conference_(1919%E2%80%931920) "Paris Peace Conference (1919–1920)"). The [League of Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Nations "League of Nations") was approved and started operations, but the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States") never joined. On 10 January 1920, the League of Nations formally came into being when the [Covenant of the League of Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covenant_of_the_League_of_Nations "Covenant of the League of Nations"), ratified by 42 nations in 1919, took effect.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-3) The League Council acted as an executive body directing the Assembly's business. It began with four permanent members—the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland"), [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France "France"), [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy "Italy"), and [Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan "Japan").

After some limited successes and failures during the 1920s, the League proved ineffective in the 1930s, as it failed to act against the [Japanese invasion of Manchuria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_invasion_of_Manchuria "Japanese invasion of Manchuria") in 1933. Forty nations voted for Japan to withdraw from [Manchuria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchuria "Manchuria") but Japan voted against it and walked out of the League instead of withdrawing from Manchuria.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-4) It also failed to act against the [Second Italo-Ethiopian War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Italo-Ethiopian_War "Second Italo-Ethiopian War"), after the appeal for international intervention by [Ethiopian Emperor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopian_Emperor "Ethiopian Emperor")[Haile Selassie I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haile_Selassie "Haile Selassie") at Geneva in 1936 went with no avail, including when calls for economic sanctions against Italy failed. Italy and other nations left the League.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-5)

When [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II") broke out in 1939, the League effectively closed down.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-6)

### Declarations by the Allies of World War II (1941–1944)

[![Image 6](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/United_Nations_organization_sketch_by_Franklin_Roosevelt_with_the_Four_Policemen_in_1943.jpg/250px-United_Nations_organization_sketch_by_Franklin_Roosevelt_with_the_Four_Policemen_in_1943.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:United_Nations_organization_sketch_by_Franklin_Roosevelt_with_the_Four_Policemen_in_1943.jpg)

1943 sketch by Franklin Roosevelt of the UN original three branches: The [Four Policemen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Policemen "Four Policemen"), an executive branch, and an international assembly of forty UN member states.

The first step towards the establishment of the United Nations was the Inter-Allied Conference in London that led to the [Declaration of St James's Palace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_St_James%27s_Palace "Declaration of St James's Palace") on 12 June 1941.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-7)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-8) By August 1941, American President [Franklin Roosevelt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt "Franklin D. Roosevelt") and British Prime Minister [Winston Churchill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill "Winston Churchill") had drafted the [Atlantic Charter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Charter "Atlantic Charter"); which defined goals for the post-war world. At the subsequent meeting of the Inter-Allied Council in London on 24 September 1941, the eight [governments in exile of countries under Axis occupation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_governments_in_exile_during_World_War_II "List of governments in exile during World War II"), together with the [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union") and representatives of the [Free French Forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_French_Forces "Free French Forces"), unanimously adopted adherence to the common principles of policy set forth by Britain and the United States.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-9)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-10)

Roosevelt and Churchill met at the [White House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House "White House") in December 1941 for the [Arcadia Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcadia_Conference "Arcadia Conference"). Roosevelt is considered a founder of the UN,[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-11)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-12) and coined the term _United Nations_ to describe the [Allied countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II "Allies of World War II").[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-13) Churchill accepted it, noting its use by [Lord Byron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Byron "Lord Byron").[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-14) The text of the [Declaration by United Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_by_United_Nations "Declaration by United Nations") was drafted on 29 December 1941, by Roosevelt, Churchill, and [Harry Hopkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Hopkins "Harry Hopkins"). It incorporated Soviet suggestions but included no role for France. One major change from the Atlantic Charter was the addition of a provision for [religious freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_freedom "Religious freedom"), which Stalin approved after Roosevelt insisted.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-15)[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTESherwood1948447%E2%80%93453-16)

Roosevelt's idea of the "[Four Powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Policemen "Four Policemen")", refers to the four major Allied countries, the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_China_(1912%E2%80%931949) "Republic of China (1912–1949)"), emerged in the Declaration by the United Nations.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-sheriff-17) On New Year's Day 1942, Roosevelt, Churchill, the Soviet Union's former Foreign Minister [Maxim Litvinov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxim_Litvinov "Maxim Litvinov"), and the Chinese Premier [T. V. Soong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._V._Soong "T. V. Soong") signed the "[Declaration by United Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_by_United_Nations "Declaration by United Nations")",[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-18) and the next day the representatives of twenty-two other nations added their signatures. During the war, the United Nations became the official term for the Allies. In order to join, countries had to sign the Declaration and declare war on the [Axis powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_powers "Axis powers").[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTESchlesinger2003-19)

The October 1943 [Moscow Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Conference_(1943) "Moscow Conference (1943)") resulted in the [Moscow Declarations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Declarations "Moscow Declarations"), including the [Four Power Declaration on General Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_the_Four_Nations "Declaration of the Four Nations"). This declaration was signed by the [Allied Big Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Four_(World_War_II) "Big Four (World War II)")—the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and China—and aimed for the creation "at the earliest possible date of a general international organization". This was the first public announcement that a new international organization was being contemplated to replace the League of Nations. The [Tehran Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran_Conference "Tehran Conference") followed shortly afterwards at which Roosevelt, Churchill and [Joseph Stalin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin "Joseph Stalin"), the leader of the Soviet Union, met and discussed the idea of a post-war international organization.

The new international organization was formulated and negotiated amongst the delegations from the [Allied Big Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Four_(World_War_II) "Big Four (World War II)") at the [Dumbarton Oaks Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumbarton_Oaks_Conference "Dumbarton Oaks Conference") from 21 September to 7 October 1944. They agreed on proposals for the aims, structure and functioning of the new organization.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-Bohlen_1973-20)[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-21)[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-22) It took the [conference at Yalta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yalta_Conference "Yalta Conference") in February 1945, and further negotiations with the Soviet Union, before all the issues were resolved.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-Bohlen_1973-20)

### Founding (1945)

[![Image 7](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/United_Nations_Member_States-1945.png/500px-United_Nations_Member_States-1945.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:United_Nations_Member_States-1945.png)

The UN in 1945: founding members in light blue, protectorates and territories of the founding members in dark blue (Some nations' land would be different from now.)

By 1 March 1945, 21 additional states had signed the Declaration by the United Nations.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEOsma%C5%84czyk20042445-23) After months of planning, the [UN Conference on International Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Conference_on_International_Organization "United Nations Conference on International Organization") opened in [San Francisco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco "San Francisco") on 25 April 1945. It was attended by 50 nations' governments and a number of non-governmental organizations.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-Charter-24)[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-UNHistory-25)[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-26) The delegations of the Big Four chaired the plenary meetings.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-27) Previously, Churchill had urged Roosevelt to restore France to its status of a major power after the [liberation of Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberation_of_Paris "Liberation of Paris") in August 1944. The drafting of the [Charter of the United Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter_of_the_United_Nations "Charter of the United Nations") was completed over the following two months, and it was signed on 26 June 1945 by the representatives of the 50 countries.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-28)[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-29) The UN officially came into existence on 24 October 1945, upon ratification of the Charter by the five permanent members of the [Security Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council "United Nations Security Council"): the United States, the United Kingdom, France, the Soviet Union and [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_China_(1912%E2%80%931949) "Republic of China (1912–1949)") — and by a majority of the other 46 nations.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-unmilestones1941to1950-30)[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-original_draft-31)

The first meetings of the [General Assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Assembly "General Assembly"), with 51 nations represented,[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-34) and the Security Council took place in [London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London "London") beginning in January 1946.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-unmilestones1941to1950-30) Debates began at once, covering topical issues such as the presence of Russian troops in [Iranian Azerbaijan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Azerbaijan "Iranian Azerbaijan") and British forces in [Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece "Greece").[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-35) British diplomat [Gladwyn Jebb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladwyn_Jebb "Gladwyn Jebb") served as interim secretary-general.

The General Assembly selected [New York City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City "New York City") as the site for the headquarters of the UN. Construction began on 14 September 1948 and the facility was completed on 9 October 1952. The Norwegian Foreign Minister, [Trygve Lie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trygve_Lie "Trygve Lie"), was the first elected [UN secretary-general](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations "Secretary-General of the United Nations").[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-unmilestones1941to1950-30)

### Cold War (1947–1991)

[![Image 8](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/Dag_Hammarskj%C3%B6ld_%283x4_cropped%29.jpg/250px-Dag_Hammarskj%C3%B6ld_%283x4_cropped%29.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Dag_Hammarskj%C3%B6ld_(3x4_cropped).jpg)

[Dag Hammarskjöld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dag_Hammarskj%C3%B6ld "Dag Hammarskjöld") was a particularly active secretary-general from 1953 until he died in 1961.

Though the UN's primary mandate was [peacekeeping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacekeeping "Peacekeeping"), the division between the United States and the Soviet Union often paralysed the organization; generally allowing it to intervene only in conflicts distant from the [Cold War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War "Cold War").[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMeisler199535-36) Two notable exceptions were a Security Council resolution on 7 July 1950 authorizing a [US-led coalition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Command "United Nations Command") to repel the [North Korean invasion of South Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War "Korean War"), passed in the absence of the Soviet Union,[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-unmilestones1941to1950-30)[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMeisler199558%E2%80%9359-37) and the signing of the [Korean Armistice Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Armistice_Agreement "Korean Armistice Agreement") on 27 July 1953.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-38)

On 29 November 1947, the General Assembly approved [resolution 181](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Partition_Plan_for_Palestine "United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine"), a proposal to partition [Palestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_Palestine "Mandatory Palestine") into two states, with Jerusalem placed under a special international regime.[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-39) The plan failed[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-186-20240719-40) and a [civil war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1947%E2%80%931948_civil_war_in_Mandatory_Palestine "1947–1948 civil war in Mandatory Palestine") broke out in Palestine, that led to the creation of the state of [Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel "Israel") afterward.[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-41) Two years later, [Ralph Bunche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Bunche "Ralph Bunche"), a UN official, negotiated [an armistice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1949_Armistice_Agreements "1949 Armistice Agreements") to the [resulting conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Palestine_war "1948 Palestine war"), with the Security Council deciding that "an armistice shall be established in all sectors of Palestine".[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-186-20240719-40)[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMeisler199551%E2%80%9354-42) On 7 November 1956, the [first UN peacekeeping force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Emergency_Force "United Nations Emergency Force") was established to end the [Suez Crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suez_Crisis "Suez Crisis");[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-unmilestones1951to1960-43) however, the UN was unable to intervene against the Soviet Union's simultaneous invasion of [Hungary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary "Hungary"), following [the country's revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_Revolution_of_1956 "Hungarian Revolution of 1956").[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMeisler1995114-44)

On 14 July 1960, the UN established the [United Nations Operation in the Congo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Operation_in_the_Congo "United Nations Operation in the Congo") (or UNOC), the largest military force of its early decades, to bring order to [Katanga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Katanga "State of Katanga"), restoring it to the control of the [Democratic Republic of the Congo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_the_Congo_(L%C3%A9opoldville) "Republic of the Congo (Léopoldville)") by 11 May 1964.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMeisler1995115%E2%80%93134-45) While travelling to meet rebel leader [Moise Tshombe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moise_Tshombe "Moise Tshombe") during the conflict, [Dag Hammarskjöld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dag_Hammarskj%C3%B6ld "Dag Hammarskjöld"), often named as one of the UN's most effective secretaries-general,[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMeisler199576-46)[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKennedy200760-47)[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFasulo200417,_20-48)[died in a plane crash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1961_Ndola_United_Nations_DC-6_crash "1961 Ndola United Nations DC-6 crash"). Months later he was posthumously awarded the [Nobel Peace Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Peace_Prize "Nobel Peace Prize").[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMeisler1995127%E2%80%93128,_134-49) In 1964, Hammarskjöld's successor, [U Thant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U_Thant "U Thant"), deployed the [UN Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Peacekeeping_Force_in_Cyprus "United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus"), which would become one of the UN's longest-running peacekeeping missions.[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMeisler1995156%E2%80%93157-50)

With the spread of [decolonization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decolonization "Decolonization") in the 1960s, the UN's membership shot up due to an influx of newly independent nations. In 1960 alone, 17 new states joined the UN, 16 of them from Africa.[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-unmilestones1951to1960-43) On 25 October 1971, with opposition from the United States, but with the support of many [Third World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_World "Third World") nations, the [People's Republic of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China "China") was given the Chinese seat on the Security Council in place of the [Republic of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan "Taiwan") (also known as Taiwan). The vote was widely seen as a sign of waning American influence in the organization.[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMeisler1995195%E2%80%93197-51) Third World nations organized themselves into the [Group of 77](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_of_77 "Group of 77") under the leadership of Algeria, which briefly became a dominant power at the UN.[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMeisler1995208%E2%80%93210-52) On 10 November 1975, a bloc comprising the Soviet Union and Third World nations passed [a resolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_3379 "United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3379"), over strenuous American and Israeli opposition, declaring [Zionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism "Zionism") to be a form of [racism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism "Racism"). The resolution was repealed on 16 December 1991, shortly after the end of the Cold War.[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMeisler1995204%E2%80%93226,_213,_220%E2%80%93221-53)[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-54)

With an increasing Third World presence and the failure of UN mediation in conflicts in the [Middle East](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six-Day_War "Six-Day War"), [Vietnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War "Vietnam War"), and [Kashmir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Pakistani_War_of_1965 "Indo-Pakistani War of 1965"), the UN increasingly shifted its attention to its secondary goals of economic development and cultural exchange.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMeisler1995167%E2%80%93168,_224%E2%80%93225-55) By the 1970s, the UN budget for social and economic development was far greater than its peacekeeping budget.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

Marking of the UN's 70th anniversary – Budapest, 2015

After the Cold War, the UN saw a radical expansion in its peacekeeping duties, taking on more missions in five years than it had in the previous four decades.[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-56) Between 1988 and 2000, the number of adopted Security Council resolutions more than doubled, and the peacekeeping budget increased more than tenfold.[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-57)[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFasulo200443-58)[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMeisler1995334-59)[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-60) The UN negotiated an end to the [Salvadoran Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvadoran_Civil_War "Salvadoran Civil War"), launched a successful [peacekeeping mission in Namibia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Transition_Assistance_Group "United Nations Transition Assistance Group"), and oversaw democratic elections in post-[apartheid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartheid_in_South_Africa "Apartheid in South Africa") South Africa and post-[Khmer Rouge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmer_Rouge "Khmer Rouge") Cambodia.[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMeisler1995252%E2%80%93256-61) In 1991, the UN authorized a [US-led coalition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_War "Gulf War") that repulsed Iraq's [invasion of Kuwait](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_Kuwait "Invasion of Kuwait").[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMeisler1995264%E2%80%93277-62)[Brian Urquhart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Urquhart "Brian Urquhart"), the under-secretary-general of the UN from 1971 to 1985, later described the hopes raised by these successes as a "false renaissance" for the organization, given the more troubled missions that followed.[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMeisler1995334-59)

Beginning in the last decades of the [Cold War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War "Cold War"), critics of the UN condemned the organization for perceived mismanagement and corruption.[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMeisler1995226%E2%80%93227-63) In 1984, American President [Ronald Reagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan "Ronald Reagan") withdrew the United States' funding from the [United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO "UNESCO") (or UNESCO) over allegations of mismanagement, followed by the United Kingdom and Singapore.[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMeisler1995234%E2%80%93237-64)[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-65)[Boutros Boutros-Ghali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boutros_Boutros-Ghali "Boutros Boutros-Ghali"), the secretary-general from 1992 to 1996, initiated a reform of the Secretariat, somewhat reducing the size of the organization.[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMeisler1995285%E2%80%93286-66)[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-NST-67) His successor, [Kofi Annan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kofi_Annan "Kofi Annan"), initiated further management reforms in the face of threats from the US to withhold its UN dues.[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-NST-67)

Though the UN Charter had been written primarily to prevent aggression by one nation against another, in the early 1990s the UN faced several simultaneous, serious crises within Somalia, Haiti, Mozambique, and the nations that previously made up Yugoslavia.[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKennedy200766%E2%80%9367-68) The [UN mission in Somalia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Operation_in_Somalia_II "United Nations Operation in Somalia II") was widely viewed as a failure after the United States' withdrawal following casualties in the [Battle of Mogadishu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Mogadishu_(1993) "Battle of Mogadishu (1993)"). The [UN mission to Bosnia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Protection_Force "United Nations Protection Force") faced worldwide ridicule for its indecisive and confused mission in the face of ethnic cleansing.[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-69) In 1994, the [UN Assistance Mission for Rwanda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Assistance_Mission_for_Rwanda "United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda") failed to intervene in the [Rwandan genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwandan_genocide "Rwandan genocide") amidst indecision in the Security Council.[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKennedy2007104-70)

From the late 1990s to the early 2000s, international interventions authorized by the UN took a wider variety of forms. The [United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_1244 "United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244") authorized the [NATO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO "NATO")-led [Kosovo Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosovo_Force "Kosovo Force") beginning in 1999. The [UN mission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Mission_in_Sierra_Leone "United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone") in the [Sierra Leone Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Leone_Civil_War "Sierra Leone Civil War") was supplemented by a [British military intervention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_military_intervention_in_the_Sierra_Leone_Civil_War "British military intervention in the Sierra Leone Civil War"). The [invasion of Afghanistan in 2001](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Afghanistan_(2001%E2%80%93present) "War in Afghanistan (2001–present)") was overseen by NATO.[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKennedy2007110%E2%80%93111-71) In 2003, the United States [invaded Iraq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_invasion_of_Iraq "2003 invasion of Iraq") despite failing to pass a UN Security Council resolution for authorization, prompting a new round of questioning of the UN's effectiveness.[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKennedy2007111-72)

Under the eighth secretary-general, [Ban Ki-moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ban_Ki-moon "Ban Ki-moon"), the UN intervened with peacekeepers in crises such as the [War in Darfur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Darfur "War in Darfur") in Sudan and the [Kivu conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kivu_conflict "Kivu conflict") in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and sent observers and chemical weapons inspectors to the [Syrian Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_Civil_War "Syrian Civil War").[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-73) In 2013, [an internal review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary-General%27s_Internal_Review_Panel_on_United_Nations_Action_in_Sri_Lanka "Secretary-General's Internal Review Panel on United Nations Action in Sri Lanka") of UN actions in [the final battles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alleged_war_crimes_during_the_final_stages_of_the_Sri_Lankan_Civil_War "Alleged war crimes during the final stages of the Sri Lankan Civil War") of the [Sri Lankan Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_civil_war "Sri Lankan civil war") in 2009 concluded that the organization had suffered a "systemic failure".[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-74) In 2010, the organization suffered the worst loss of life in its history, when 101 personnel died in the [Haiti earthquake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Haiti_earthquake "2010 Haiti earthquake").[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-unmilestones2001to2010-75) Acting under the [United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_1973 "United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973") in 2011, [NATO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO "NATO") countries intervened in the [First Libyan Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Libyan_Civil_War "First Libyan Civil War").

The [Millennium Summit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Summit "Millennium Summit") was held in 2000 to discuss the UN's role in the 21st century.[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-BBCagenda-76) The three-day meeting was the largest gathering of world leaders in history, and it culminated in the adoption by all member states of the [Millennium Development Goals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Development_Goals "Millennium Development Goals") (or MDGs), a commitment to achieve international development in areas such as [poverty reduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty_reduction "Poverty reduction"), [gender equality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_equality "Gender equality") and [public health](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health "Public health"). Progress towards these goals, which were to be met by 2015, was ultimately uneven. The [2005 World Summit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_World_Summit "2005 World Summit") reaffirmed the UN's focus on promoting development, peacekeeping, human rights and global security.[[76]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-77) The [Sustainable Development Goals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goals "Sustainable Development Goals") (or SDGs) were launched in 2015 to succeed the Millennium Development Goals.[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-Sustainable_Development_Goals-78)

In addition to addressing global challenges, the UN has sought to improve its accountability and democratic legitimacy by engaging more with [civil society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_society "Civil society") and fostering a global constituency.[[78]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-79) In an effort to enhance transparency, in 2016 the organization held its first public debate between candidates for secretary-general.[[79]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-80) On 1 January 2017, Portuguese diplomat [António Guterres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant%C3%B3nio_Guterres "António Guterres"), who had previously served as the [UN High Commissioner for Refugees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_High_Commissioner_for_Refugees "United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees"), became the ninth secretary-general. Guterres has highlighted several key goals for his administration, including an emphasis on diplomacy for preventing conflicts, more effective peacekeeping efforts, and streamlining the organization to be more responsive and versatile to international needs.[[80]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-81)

On 13 June 2019, the UN signed a Strategic Partnership Framework with the [World Economic Forum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Economic_Forum "World Economic Forum") in order to "jointly accelerate" the implementation of the [2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2030_Agenda_for_Sustainable_Development "2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development").[[81]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-82)

In 2025, the UN began facing a financial crisis resulting from delays in member state due payments.[[82]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-:2-83) A major problem is that the United States, a major contributor, often intentionally does not pay in full and delays its payments in order to influence the UN, such as on topics like the [Gaza war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_war "Gaza war"), as the existence of the UN relies on such payments. Other countries have begun to follow suit, triggering a financial crisis.[[83]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-84) In 19 May 2025, only 61 countries paid their dues on time and in full.[[82]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-:2-83) The crisis is causing massive budget cuts within the UN, with the UN warning that millions of lives are being put at risk.[[84]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-85)[[82]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-:2-83)

Structure
---------

The United Nations is part of the broader UN System, which includes an extensive network of institutions and entities. Central to the organization are five principal organs established by the UN Charter: the [General Assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly "United Nations General Assembly"), the [Security Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council "United Nations Security Council"), the [Economic and Social Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Economic_and_Social_Council "United Nations Economic and Social Council"), the [International Court of Justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Court_of_Justice "International Court of Justice") and the [UN Secretariat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Secretariat "United Nations Secretariat").[[85]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFasulo20043%E2%80%934-86) A sixth principal organ, the [Trusteeship Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Trusteeship_Council "United Nations Trusteeship Council"), suspended its operations on 1 November 1994 upon the independence of [Palau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palau "Palau"); the last remaining UN trustee territory.[[86]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFasulo20048-87)

Four of the five principal organs are located at the main UN Headquarters in New York City, while the International Court of Justice is seated in [The Hague](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hague "The Hague").[[87]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-88) Most other major agencies are based in the [UN offices at Geneva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Office_at_Geneva "United Nations Office at Geneva"),[[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-89)[Vienna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Office_at_Vienna "United Nations Office at Vienna"),[[89]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-90) and [Nairobi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Office_at_Nairobi "United Nations Office at Nairobi"),[[90]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-91) and additional UN institutions are located throughout the world. The six [official languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_language "Official language") of the UN, used in intergovernmental meetings and documents, are [Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic "Arabic"), [Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language "Chinese language"), [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language "English language"), [French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language "French language"), [Russian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language "Russian language") and [Spanish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language "Spanish language").[[91]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-langs-92) On the basis of the [Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_on_the_Privileges_and_Immunities_of_the_United_Nations "Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations"), the UN and its agencies are [immune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomatic_immunity "Diplomatic immunity") from the laws of the countries where they operate, safeguarding the UN's impartiality with regard to host and member countries.[[92]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-93)

Below the six organs are, in the words of the author Linda Fasulo, "an amazing collection of entities and organizations, some of which are actually older than the UN itself and operate with almost complete independence from it".[[93]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFasulo20044-94) These include specialized agencies, research and training institutions, programmes and funds and other UN entities.[[94]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFasulo20044%E2%80%937-95)

All organizations in the UN system obey the _Noblemaire principle_, which calls for salaries that will attract and retain citizens of countries where compensation is highest, and which ensures equal pay for work of equal value regardless of the employee's nationality.[[95]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-un-salaries-96)[[96]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-97) In practice, the [International Civil Service Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Civil_Service_Commission "International Civil Service Commission"), which governs the conditions of UN personnel, takes reference to the highest-paying national civil service.[[97]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-98) Staff salaries are subject to an internal tax that is administered by the UN organizations.[[95]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-un-salaries-96)[[98]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-99)

[Mikhail Gorbachev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Gorbachev "Mikhail Gorbachev"), leader of the Soviet Union, addressing the UN General Assembly in December 1988

The General Assembly is the primary [deliberative assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliberative_assembly "Deliberative assembly") of the UN. Composed of all [UN member states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_states_of_the_United_Nations "Member states of the United Nations"), the assembly gathers at annual sessions at the [General Assembly Hall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Hall "United Nations General Assembly Hall"), but emergency sessions can be summoned.[[100]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFomerand2009131%E2%80%93133-101) The assembly is led by a [president](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_Nations_General_Assembly "President of the United Nations General Assembly"), elected by the member states on a rotating regional basis, and 21 vice-presidents.[[101]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFasulo200469%E2%80%9370-102) The first session convened on 10 January 1946 in the [Methodist Central Hall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodist_Central_Hall,_Westminster "Methodist Central Hall, Westminster") in London and comprised representatives of 51 nations.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-unmilestones1941to1950-30)

When the General Assembly decides on seminal questions such as those on peace and security, admission of new members and budgetary matters, a two-thirds majority of those present and voting is required.[[102]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-103)[[103]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-104) All other questions are decided by a majority vote. Each member has one vote. Apart from the approval of budgetary matters, resolutions are not binding on the members. The Assembly may make recommendations on any matters within the scope of the UN, except matters of peace and security that are under consideration by the Security Council.[[100]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFomerand2009131%E2%80%93133-101)

Draft resolutions can be forwarded to the General Assembly by its six main committees:[[104]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFasulo200470%E2%80%9373-105)

*   [First Committee (Disarmament and International Security)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Assembly_First_Committee "General Assembly First Committee")
*   [Second Committee (Economic and Financial)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Second_Committee "United Nations General Assembly Second Committee")
*   [Third Committee (Social, Humanitarian, and Cultural)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Third_Committee "United Nations General Assembly Third Committee")
*   [Fourth Committee (Special Political and Decolonization)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Fourth_Committee "United Nations Fourth Committee")
*   [Fifth Committee (Administrative and Budgetary)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Fifth_Committee "United Nations General Assembly Fifth Committee")
*   [Sixth Committee (Legal)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Sixth_Committee_(Legal) "United Nations General Assembly Sixth Committee (Legal)")

As well as by the following two committees:

*   [General Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Committee "United Nations General Committee") – a supervisory committee consisting of the assembly's president, vice-presidents, and committee heads
*   [Credentials Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Credentials_Committee "United Nations Credentials Committee") – responsible for determining the credentials of each member nation's UN representatives

### Security Council

[![Image 19](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/Colin_Powell_anthrax_vial._5_Feb_2003_at_the_UN.jpg/250px-Colin_Powell_anthrax_vial._5_Feb_2003_at_the_UN.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Colin_Powell_anthrax_vial._5_Feb_2003_at_the_UN.jpg)

[Colin Powell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Powell "Colin Powell"), the [US Secretary of State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State "United States Secretary of State"), demonstrates a vial with [alleged](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legitimacy_of_the_2003_invasion_of_Iraq#Weapons_of_Mass_Destruction "Legitimacy of the 2003 invasion of Iraq") Iraq [chemical weapon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_weapon "Chemical weapon") probes to the UN Security Council on [Iraq war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_and_the_Iraq_War "United Nations Security Council and the Iraq War") hearings, 5 February 2003.

The Security Council is charged with maintaining peace and security among nations. While other organs of the UN can only make recommendations to member states, the Security Council has the power to make binding decisions that member states have agreed to carry out, under the terms of Charter Article 25.[[105]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-Chapter|V-106) The decisions of the council are known as [United Nations Security Council resolutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_resolution "United Nations Security Council resolution").[[106]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFasulo200439%E2%80%9343-107)

The Security Council is made up of fifteen member states: five permanent members (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States) and ten non-permanent members (currently [Algeria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria "Algeria"), [Ecuador](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecuador "Ecuador"), [Guyana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guyana "Guyana"), [Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan "Japan"), [Malta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malta "Malta"), [Mozambique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozambique "Mozambique"), the [Republic of Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Korea "Republic of Korea"), [Sierra Leone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Leone "Sierra Leone"), [Slovenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia "Slovenia") and [Switzerland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland "Switzerland")).[[107]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-108) The five permanent members hold [veto power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_veto_power "United Nations Security Council veto power") over UN resolutions, allowing a permanent member to block adoption of a resolution, though not debate. The ten temporary seats are held for two-year terms, with five members elected each year by the General Assembly on a [regional basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Regional_Groups "United Nations Regional Groups").[[108]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFasulo200440%E2%80%9341-109) The presidency of the Security Council rotates alphabetically each month.[[109]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-110)

### UN Secretariat

[![Image 20](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Ant%C3%B3nio_Guterres%2C_23.03.23.jpg/250px-Ant%C3%B3nio_Guterres%2C_23.03.23.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ant%C3%B3nio_Guterres,_23.03.23.jpg)

[António Guterres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant%C3%B3nio_Guterres "António Guterres"), the current [secretary-general](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations "Secretary-General of the United Nations")

The UN Secretariat carries out the day-to-day duties required to operate and maintain the UN system.[[110]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-111) It is composed of tens of thousands of international civil servants worldwide and headed by the [secretary-general](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations "Secretary-General of the United Nations"), who is assisted by the [deputy secretary-general](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations "Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations").[[111]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFasulo200421-112) The Secretariat's duties include providing information and facilities needed by UN bodies for their meetings and carrying out tasks as directed by the Security Council, the General Assembly, the Economic and Social Council, and other UN bodies.[[112]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFomerand2009285-113)

The secretary-general acts as the spokesperson and leader of the UN. The position is defined in the UN Charter as the organization's chief administrative officer.[[113]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-114) Article 99 of the charter states that the secretary-general can bring to the Security Council's attention "any matter which in their opinion may threaten the maintenance of international peace and security", a phrase that secretaries-general since [Trygve Lie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trygve_Lie "Trygve Lie") have interpreted as giving the position broad scope for action on the world stage.[[114]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMeisler199531%E2%80%9332-115) The office has evolved into a dual role of an administrator of the UN organization and a diplomat and mediator addressing disputes between member states and finding consensus to [global issues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_global_issues "List of global issues").[[115]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKennedy200759%E2%80%9362-116)

The secretary-general is appointed by the General Assembly, after being recommended by the Security Council, where the permanent members have veto power. There are no specific criteria for the post, but over the years it has become accepted that the position shall be held for one or two terms of five years.[[116]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-117) The current secretary-general is [António Guterres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant%C3%B3nio_Guterres "António Guterres") of Portugal, who replaced [Ban Ki-moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ban_Ki-moon "Ban Ki-moon") in 2017.

### International Court of Justice

[![Image 31](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Grand_Hall_de_Justice_de_Palais_de_La_Paix_%C3%A0_La_Haye_Pays-Bas.jpg/250px-Grand_Hall_de_Justice_de_Palais_de_La_Paix_%C3%A0_La_Haye_Pays-Bas.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Grand_Hall_de_Justice_de_Palais_de_La_Paix_%C3%A0_La_Haye_Pays-Bas.jpg)

The ICJ ruled that [Kosovo's unilateral declaration of independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Kosovo_declaration_of_independence "2008 Kosovo declaration of independence") from Serbia in 2008 did not violate international law.

The International Court of Justice (or ICJ), sometimes known as the World Court,[[118]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-britannica.com-119) is the primary judicial organ of the UN. It is the successor to the [Permanent Court of International Justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_Court_of_International_Justice "Permanent Court of International Justice") and occupies the body's former headquarters in the [Peace Palace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_Palace "Peace Palace") in [The Hague, Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hague "The Hague"), making it the only principal organ not based in New York City. The ICJ's main function is adjudicating disputes among nations. Examples of issues they have heard include war crimes, violations of state sovereignty and ethnic cleansing.[[119]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-120) The court can also be called upon by other UN organs to provide advisory opinions on matters of international law.[[120]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFomerand2009183-121) All UN member states are parties to the [ICJ Statute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute_of_the_International_Court_of_Justice "Statute of the International Court of Justice"), which forms an integral part of the UN Charter, and non-members may also become parties. The ICJ's rulings are binding upon parties and, along with its advisory opinions, serve as [sources of international law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sources_of_international_law "Sources of international law").[[118]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-britannica.com-119) The court is composed of 15 judges appointed to nine-year terms by the General Assembly. Every sitting judge must be from a different nation.[[120]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFomerand2009183-121)[[121]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFasulo2004100%E2%80%93101-122)

### Economic and Social Council

The Economic and Social Council (or the ECOSOC) assists the General Assembly in promoting international economic and social co-operation and development.[[122]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-:1-123) It was established to serve as the UN's primary forum for global issues and is the largest and most complex UN body.[[122]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-:1-123) The ECOSOC's functions include gathering data, conducting studies and advising and making recommendations to member states.[[123]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFomerand2009103%E2%80%93104-124)[[124]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-125) Its work is carried out primarily by subsidiary bodies focused on a wide variety of topics. These include the [United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Permanent_Forum_on_Indigenous_Issues "United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues"), which advises UN agencies on issues relating to [indigenous peoples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples "Indigenous peoples"), the [United Nations Forum on Forests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Forum_on_Forests "United Nations Forum on Forests"), which coordinates and promotes sustainable forest management, the [United Nations Statistical Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Statistical_Commission "United Nations Statistical Commission"), which co-ordinates information-gathering efforts between agencies, and the [Commission on Sustainable Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commission_on_Sustainable_Development "Commission on Sustainable Development"), which co-ordinates efforts between UN agencies and NGOs working towards [sustainable development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_development "Sustainable development"). ECOSOC may also grant consultative status to non-governmental organizations.[[123]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFomerand2009103%E2%80%93104-124) As of April 2021 almost 5,600 organizations have this status.[[125]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFasulo2004156-126)[[126]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-127)

### Specialized agencies

The UN Charter stipulates that each primary organ of the United Nations can establish various specialized agencies to fulfill its duties.[[127]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-CharterIX-128) Specialized agencies are autonomous organizations working with the United Nations and each other through the coordinating machinery of the Economic and Social Council. Each was integrated into the UN system through an agreement with the UN under UN Charter article 57.[[128]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-CEB-129) There are fifteen specialized agencies, which perform functions as diverse as facilitating international travel, preventing and addressing pandemics, and promoting economic development.[[129]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-130)[[b]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-131)

### Funds, programmes, and other bodies

The United Nations system includes a myriad of autonomous, separately administered [funds, programmes, research and training institutes, and other subsidiary bodies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_System#Funds_and_programmes,_research_and_training_institutes,_and_other_bodies "United Nations System").[[130]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-un.org-132) Each of these entities have their own area of work, governance structure, and budgets such as the [World Trade Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Organization "World Trade Organization") (or the WTO) and the [International Atomic Energy Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Atomic_Energy_Agency "International Atomic Energy Agency") (or the IAEA), operate independently of the UN but maintain formal partnership agreements. The UN performs much of its humanitarian work through these institutions, such as preventing famine and malnutrition (the [World Food Programme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Food_Programme "World Food Programme")), protecting vulnerable and displaced people (the [UNHCR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_High_Commissioner_for_Refugees "United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees")), and combating the HIV/AIDS pandemic (the [UNAIDS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_United_Nations_Programme_on_HIV/AIDS "Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS")).[[131]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFasulo2004171%E2%80%93177-133)

> 1.   Membership in the United Nations is open to all other peace-loving states that accept the obligations contained in the present Charter and, in the judgment of the Organization, are able and willing to carry out these obligations.
> 2.   The admission of any such state to membership in the United Nations will be effected by a decision of the General Assembly upon the recommendation of the Security Council. Chapter II, Article 4.[[134]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-136)

[![Image 82](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Presiden_Sukarno.jpg/250px-Presiden_Sukarno.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Presiden_Sukarno.jpg)

Under the leadership of [Sukarno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukarno "Sukarno"), Indonesia was [the first and only country that attempted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia_and_the_United_Nations#Withdrawal_in_1965 "Indonesia and the United Nations") to leave the United Nations.

In addition, there are two [non-member observer states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_observers "United Nations General Assembly observers"): the [Holy See](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_See "Holy See") and [Palestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine "Palestine").[[135]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-137)[[c]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-138) The [Cook Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cook_Islands "Cook Islands") and [Niue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niue "Niue"), both [states in free association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_state "Associated state") with [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand "New Zealand"), are full members of several UN specialized agencies and have had their "full treaty-making capacity" recognized by the Secretariat.[[136]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-art102-139)

[Indonesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia "Indonesia") was the first and the only nation that attempted to withdraw its membership from the United Nations, in protest to the election of Malaysia as a non-permanent member of the [Security Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council "United Nations Security Council") in 1965 during [conflict between the two countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia%E2%80%93Malaysia_confrontation "Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation").[[137]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-140) After forming [CONEFO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CONEFO "CONEFO") as a short-lived rival to the UN, Indonesia resumed its membership in 1966.

### Group of 77

The Group of 77 (or the G77) at the UN is a loose coalition of [developing nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_nations "Developing nations") that is designed to promote its members' collective economic interests and create an enhanced joint negotiating capacity in the UN. Seventy-seven nations founded the organization, but by November 2013 the organization had since expanded to 133 member countries.[[138]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-141) The group was founded 15 June 1964 by the "Joint Declaration of the Seventy-Seven Countries" issued at the [United Nations Conference on Trade and Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Conference_on_Trade_and_Development "United Nations Conference on Trade and Development") (or the UNCTAD). The group held its first major meeting in [Algiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algiers "Algiers") in 1967, where it adopted the Charter of Algiers and established the basis for permanent institutional structures.[[139]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-142) With the adoption of the [New International Economic Order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_International_Economic_Order "New International Economic Order") by developing countries in the 1970s, the work of the G77 spread throughout the UN system.[[140]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-143) Similar groupings of developing states also operate in other UN agencies, such as the [Group of 24](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_of_24 "Group of 24") (or the G-24), which operates in the IMF on monetary affairs.[[141]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-144)

United Nations Peacekeeping Logo

The UN, after approval by the Security Council, sends peacekeepers to regions where armed conflict has recently ceased or paused to enforce the terms of peace agreements and to discourage combatants from resuming hostilities. Since the UN does not maintain its own military, peacekeeping forces are voluntarily provided by member states. These soldiers are sometimes nicknamed "Blue Helmets" because they wear distinctive blue helmets.[[144]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFasulo200452-147)[[145]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTECoulon1998ix-148) Peacekeeping forces as a whole received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1988.[[146]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-149)

The UN has carried out 71 peacekeeping operations since 1947, and As of April 2021, over 88,000 peacekeeping personnel from 121 nations have been deployed on missions.[[147]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-150) The largest is the [United Nations Mission in South Sudan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Mission_in_South_Sudan "United Nations Mission in South Sudan") (or UNMISS), which has close to 19,200 uniformed personnel,[[148]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-151) and the smallest, the [United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Military_Observer_Group_in_India_and_Pakistan "United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan") (or UNMOGIP), consists of 113 civilians and experts charged with monitoring the ceasefire in [Jammu and Kashmir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jammu_and_Kashmir_(state) "Jammu and Kashmir (state)"). UN peacekeepers with the [United Nations Truce Supervision Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Truce_Supervision_Organization "United Nations Truce Supervision Organization") (or UNTSO) have been stationed in the Middle East since 1948, the longest-running active peacekeeping mission.[[149]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-UNPO-152)

A study by the RAND Corporation in 2005 found the UN to be successful in two-thirds of its peacekeeping efforts. It compared efforts at nation-building by the UN to those of the United States and found that 87.5% of UN cases are at peace, as compared with 50% of U.S. cases at peace.[[150]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-153) Also in 2005, the [Human Security Report](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Security_Report_2005 "Human Security Report 2005") documented a decline in the number of wars, [genocides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide "Genocide"), and [human rights abuses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_abuses "Human rights abuses") since the end of the Cold War, and presented evidence, albeit circumstantial, that international activism – mostly spearheaded by the UN – has been the main cause of the decline in armed conflict.[[151]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-154) Situations in which the UN has not only acted to keep the peace but also intervened include the Korean War and the authorization of intervention in Iraq after the Gulf War.[[152]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKennedy200756-155) Further studies published between 2008 and 2021 determined UN peacekeeping operations to be more effective at ensuring long-lasting peace and minimizing civilian casualties.[[153]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-:0-156)

[![Image 84](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/GreenLine_BufferZone_Large.JPG/250px-GreenLine_BufferZone_Large.JPG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:GreenLine_BufferZone_Large.JPG)

The [UN Buffer Zone in Cyprus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Buffer_Zone_in_Cyprus "UN Buffer Zone in Cyprus") was established in 1974 following the [Turkish invasion of Cyprus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_invasion_of_Cyprus "Turkish invasion of Cyprus").

The UN has also drawn criticism for perceived failures. In many cases, member states have shown reluctance to achieve or enforce Security Council resolutions. Disagreements in the Security Council about military action and intervention are seen as having failed to prevent the [Bangladesh genocide in 1971](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1971_Bangladesh_Genocide "1971 Bangladesh Genocide"),[[154]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBall201146-157) the [Cambodian genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmer_Rouge_rule_of_Cambodia "Khmer Rouge rule of Cambodia") in the 1970s,[[155]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKennedy2007187-158) and the Rwandan genocide in 1994.[[156]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKennedy2007102%E2%80%93105-159) Similarly, UN inaction is blamed for failing to either prevent the [Srebrenica massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srebrenica_massacre "Srebrenica massacre") or complete the peacekeeping operations during the [Somali Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somali_Civil_War "Somali Civil War").[[157]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMeisler1995294%E2%80%93311-160) UN peacekeepers have also been accused of child rape, soliciting prostitutes, and sexual abuse during various peacekeeping missions in the Democratic Republic of the Congo,[[158]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-161) Haiti,[[159]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-162) Liberia,[[160]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-163) Sudan,[[161]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-164) Burundi, and Côte d'Ivoire.[[162]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-165) Scientists cited UN peacekeepers from Nepal as the source of the [2010s Haiti cholera outbreak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010s_Haiti_cholera_outbreak "2010s Haiti cholera outbreak"), which killed more than 8,000 people.[[163]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-166)

In addition to peacekeeping, the UN is also active in encouraging [disarmament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disarmament "Disarmament"). Regulation of armaments was included in the writing of the UN Charter in 1945 and was envisioned as a way of limiting the use of human and economic resources for their creation.[[105]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-Chapter|V-106) The advent of [nuclear weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon "Nuclear weapon") came only weeks after the signing of the charter, resulting in the first [resolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_resolution "United Nations General Assembly resolution") of the first [General Assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Assembly "General Assembly") meeting calling for specific proposals for "the elimination from national armaments of atomic weapons and of all other major weapons adaptable to mass destruction".[[164]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-167) The UN has been involved with arms-limitation treaties such as the [Outer Space Treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_Space_Treaty "Outer Space Treaty"), the [Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_on_the_Non-Proliferation_of_Nuclear_Weapons "Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons"), the [Seabed Arms Control Treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seabed_Arms_Control_Treaty "Seabed Arms Control Treaty"), the [Biological Weapons Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_Weapons_Convention "Biological Weapons Convention"), the [Chemical Weapons Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_Weapons_Convention "Chemical Weapons Convention"), and the [Ottawa Treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottawa_Treaty "Ottawa Treaty").[[165]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFasulo2004188%E2%80%93189-168) Three UN bodies oversee arms proliferation issues: the [International Atomic Energy Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Atomic_Energy_Agency "International Atomic Energy Agency"), the [Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organisation_for_the_Prohibition_of_Chemical_Weapons "Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons") and the [Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization Preparatory Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_Nuclear-Test-Ban_Treaty_Organization_Preparatory_Commission "Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization Preparatory Commission").[[166]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFasulo2004189%E2%80%93190-169) Additionally, many peacekeeping missions focus on disarmament: several operations in West Africa disarmed roughly 250,000 former combatants and secured tens of thousands of weapons and millions of munitions.[[167]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-170)

### Human rights

One of the UN's primary purposes is "promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion", and member states pledge to undertake "joint and separate action" to protect these rights.[[127]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-CharterIX-128)[[168]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-Charter1-171)

[![Image 86](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/Eleanor_Roosevelt_UDHR.jpg/250px-Eleanor_Roosevelt_UDHR.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Eleanor_Roosevelt_UDHR.jpg)

[Eleanor Roosevelt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleanor_Roosevelt "Eleanor Roosevelt") with the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights "Universal Declaration of Human Rights"), 1949

In 1948, the General Assembly adopted a [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights "Universal Declaration of Human Rights"), drafted by a committee headed by American diplomat and activist [Eleanor Roosevelt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleanor_Roosevelt "Eleanor Roosevelt"), and including the French lawyer [René Cassin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Cassin "René Cassin"). The document proclaims basic civil, political and economic rights common to all human beings, though its effectiveness towards achieving these ends has been disputed since its drafting.[[169]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKennedy2007178%E2%80%93182-172) The Declaration serves as a "common standard of achievement for all people and all nations" rather than a legally binding document, but it has become the basis of two binding treaties, the [International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Covenant_on_Civil_and_Political_Rights "International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights") and the [International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Covenant_on_Economic,_Social_and_Cultural_Rights "International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights").[[170]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFomerand2009377-173) In practice, the UN is unable to take significant action against human rights abuses without a Security Council resolution, though it does substantial work in investigating and reporting abuses.[[171]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKennedy2007185,_188-174)

In 1979, the General Assembly adopted the [Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_on_the_Elimination_of_All_Forms_of_Discrimination_against_Women "Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women"); followed by the [Convention on the Rights of the Child](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_on_the_Rights_of_the_Child "Convention on the Rights of the Child") in 1989.[[172]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFomerand200970,_73-175) With the end of the Cold War, the push for human rights action took on new impetus.[[173]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKennedy2007192-176) The [United Nations Commission on Human Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Commission_on_Human_Rights "United Nations Commission on Human Rights") was formed in 1993 to oversee human rights issues for the UN, following the recommendation of that year's [World Conference on Human Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Conference_on_Human_Rights "World Conference on Human Rights"). Jacques Fomerand, a scholar of the UN, describes the organization's mandate as "broad and vague", with only "meagre" resources to carry it out.[[174]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFomerand2009347-177) In 2006, it was replaced by a [Human Rights Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Human_Rights_Council "United Nations Human Rights Council") consisting of 47 nations.[[175]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-178) Also in 2006, the General Assembly passed a [Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_on_the_Rights_of_Indigenous_Peoples "Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples"),[[176]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-179) and in 2011 it passed its first resolution recognizing the rights of members of the [LGBTQ+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT "LGBT") community.[[177]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-180)

Other UN bodies responsible for [women's rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_rights "Women's rights") issues include the [United Nations Commission on the Status of Women](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Commission_on_the_Status_of_Women "United Nations Commission on the Status of Women"), the [United Nations Development Fund for Women](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Development_Fund_for_Women "United Nations Development Fund for Women") and the [United Nations International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_International_Research_and_Training_Institute_for_the_Advancement_of_Women "United Nations International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women").[[178]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFomerand200957,_194,_341-181) The UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, one of three bodies with a mandate to oversee issues related to indigenous peoples, held its first session in 2002.[[179]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-182)

### Economic development and humanitarian assistance

Millennium Development Goals[[180]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-183)
1.   Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger
2.   Achieve universal primary education
3.   Promote gender equality and empower women
4.   Reduce child mortality
5.   Improve maternal health
6.   Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases
7.   Ensure environmental sustainability
8.   Develop a global partnership for development

Another primary purpose of the UN is "to achieve international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural and humanitarian character".[[168]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-Charter1-171) Numerous bodies have been created to work towards this goal, primarily under the authority of the General Assembly and the ECOSOC.[[181]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKennedy2007143%E2%80%93144-184) In 2000, the 192 UN member states agreed to achieve eight [Millennium Development Goals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Development_Goals "Millennium Development Goals") by 2015.[[182]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-185) The [Sustainable Development Goals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goals "Sustainable Development Goals") were launched in 2015 to succeed the Millennium Development Goals.[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-Sustainable_Development_Goals-78) The SDGs have an associated financing framework called the [Addis Ababa Action Agenda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addis_Ababa_Action_Agenda "Addis Ababa Action Agenda").

The [UN Development Programme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Development_Programme "United Nations Development Programme") (or the UNDP), an organization for grant-based technical assistance, is one of the leading bodies in the field of [international development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_development "International development"). The organization also publishes the UN [Human Development Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Development_Index "Human Development Index"), a comparative measure [ranking countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_Human_Development_Index "List of countries by Human Development Index") by poverty, literacy, education, life expectancy, and other factors.[[183]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFasulo2004169%E2%80%93170,_172-186)[[184]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFomerand2009341%E2%80%93342-187) The [Food and Agriculture Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Agriculture_Organization "Food and Agriculture Organization") (or the FAO) promotes agricultural development and food security.[[185]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFomerand2009126-188) The [United Nations Children's Fund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNICEF "UNICEF") (or UNICEF) was created in 1946 to aid European children after the Second World War and expanded its mission to provide aid around the world and to uphold the convention on the Rights of the Child.[[186]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-189)[[187]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-190)

Three former directors of the [Global Smallpox Eradication Programme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox#Eradication "Smallpox") reading the news that smallpox has been globally eradicated in 1980

The [World Bank Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank_Group "World Bank Group") and the [International Monetary Fund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund "International Monetary Fund") (or the IMF) are independent, specialized agencies and observers within the UN framework.[[188]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-191) They were initially formed separately from the UN through the [Bretton Woods Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretton_Woods_system "Bretton Woods system").[[189]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-192) The World Bank provides loans for international development, while the IMF promotes international economic co-operation and gives emergency loans to indebted countries.[[190]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFomerand2009175,_191%E2%80%93192-193)

In [Jordan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan "Jordan"), UNHCR remains responsible for the [Syrian refugees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_refugees "Syrian refugees") and the [Zaatari refugee camp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaatari_refugee_camp "Zaatari refugee camp").

The [World Health Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization "World Health Organization") (or WHO), which focuses on international health issues and disease eradication, is another of the UN's largest agencies. In 1980, the agency announced that the eradication of [smallpox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox "Smallpox") had been completed. In subsequent decades, [WHO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHO "WHO") eradicated [polio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polio "Polio"), [river blindness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_blindness "River blindness"), and [leprosy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leprosy "Leprosy").[[191]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFasulo2004176%E2%80%93177-194) The [Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_United_Nations_Programme_on_HIV/AIDS "Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS") (or UNAIDS) coordinated the organization's response to the AIDS epidemic.[[192]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFomerand2009199%E2%80%93200-195) The [UN Population Fund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Population_Fund "UN Population Fund"), which also dedicates part of its resources to combating HIV, is the world's largest source of funding for [reproductive health](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_health "Reproductive health") and [family planning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_planning "Family planning") services.[[193]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFomerand2009368-196)

Along with the [International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Red_Cross_and_Red_Crescent_Movement "International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement"), the UN takes a leading role in coordinating emergency relief.[[194]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFasulo2004183-197) The [World Food Programme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Food_Programme "World Food Programme") (or the WFP) provides food aid in response to famine, natural disasters, and armed conflict. The organization feeds an average of 90 million people in 80 nations per year.[[194]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFasulo2004183-197)[[195]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-198) The [Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_the_United_Nations_High_Commissioner_for_Refugees "Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees") (or the UNHCR) works to protect the rights of refugees, asylum seekers and stateless people.[[196]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-199) The UNHCR and the WFP programmes are funded by voluntary contributions from governments, corporations, and individuals, though the UNHCR's administrative costs are paid for by the UN's primary budget.[[197]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFomerand2009348,_398-200)

### Environment and climate

Beginning with the formation of the [UN Environmental Programme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Environmental_Programme "UN Environmental Programme") (or the UNEP) in 1972, the UN has made environmental issues a prominent part of its agenda. A lack of success in the first two decades of UN work in this area led to the [Earth Summit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_Summit "Earth Summit") in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1992; which sought to give new impetus to these efforts.[[198]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKennedy2007160%E2%80%93162-201) In 1988, the UNEP and the [World Meteorological Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Meteorological_Organization "World Meteorological Organization") (or the WMO), another UN organization, established the [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intergovernmental_Panel_on_Climate_Change "Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change"), which assesses and reports on research on [global warming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming "Global warming").[[199]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-202) The UN-sponsored [Kyoto Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol "Kyoto Protocol") set legally binding emissions reduction targets for ratifying states.[[200]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFasulo2004179-203)

### Other global issues

Since the UN's creation, over 80 colonies have attained independence. The General Assembly adopted the [Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_on_the_Granting_of_Independence_to_Colonial_Countries_and_Peoples "Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples") in 1960 with no votes against but abstentions from all major colonial powers. The UN works towards decolonization through groups including the [UN Committee on Decolonization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Committee_on_Decolonization "Special Committee on Decolonization").[[201]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-204) The committee lists seventeen remaining "[non-self-governing territories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-self-governing_territories "Non-self-governing territories")", the largest and most populous of which is the [Western Sahara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sahara "Western Sahara").[[202]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-205)

The UN also declares and co-ordinates [international observances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_observance "International observance") that bring awareness to issues of international interest or concern; examples include [World Tuberculosis Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Tuberculosis_Day "World Tuberculosis Day"), [Earth Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_Day "Earth Day"), and the [International Year of Deserts and Desertification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Year_of_Deserts_and_Desertification "International Year of Deserts and Desertification").[[203]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-206)

Starting in 2023, the United Nations Office for Digital and Emerging Technologies has organized an annual UN Open Source Week to facilitate collaborative and international technological projects, AI policies, and governance.[[204]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-207)

The UN budget for 2024 was $3.59 billion, not including additional resources donated by members, such as peacekeeping forces.[[206]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-209) Including [specialized agencies of the UN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_specialized_agencies_of_the_United_Nations "List of specialized agencies of the United Nations"), the UN System Chief Executives Board for Coordination reports total expenses of $67.4 billion in 2022 for 43 United Nations entities.[[207]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-210)[[208]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-211)

The UN is financed from assessed and voluntary contributions from its member states. The General Assembly approves the regular budget and determines the assessment for each member. This is broadly based on the relative capacity of each nation to pay, as measured by its [gross national income](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_national_income "Gross national income") (or GNI), with adjustments for external debt and low per capita income.[[209]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-fifth-2006-212)

The Assembly has established the principle that the UN should not be unduly dependent on any one member to finance its operations. Thus, there is a "ceiling" rate, setting the maximum amount that any member can be assessed for the regular budget. In December 2000, the Assembly revised the scale of assessments in response to pressure from the United States. As part of that revision, the regular budget ceiling was reduced from 25% to 22%.[[210]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFasulo2004117-213) For the [least developed countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_developed_country "Least developed country") (or LDCs), a ceiling rate of 0.01% is applied.[[209]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-fifth-2006-212) In addition to the ceiling rates, the minimum amount assessed to any member nation (or "floor" rate) is set at 0.001% of the UN budget ($31,000 for the two-year budget 2021–2022).[[211]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-214)[[212]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWeissDaws2009682-215)

A large share of the UN's expenditure addresses its core mission of peace and security, and this budget is assessed separately from the main organizational budget.[[213]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFasulo2004115-216) The peacekeeping budget for the 2021–2022 fiscal year is $6.38 billion, supporting 66,839 personnel deployed in 12 missions worldwide.[[214]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-217) UN peace operations are funded by assessments, using a formula derived from the regular funding scale that includes a weighted surcharge for the five permanent Security Council members, who must approve all peacekeeping operations. This surcharge serves to offset discounted peacekeeping assessment rates for less developed countries. The largest contributors to the [UN peacekeeping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacekeeping "Peacekeeping") budget for 2023–2024 are: the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States") (26.94%), [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China "China") (18.68%), [Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan "Japan") (8.03%), [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany "Germany") (6.11%), the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom "United Kingdom") (5.35%), [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France "France") (5.28%), [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy "Italy") (3.18%), [Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada "Canada") (2.62%), [South Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea "South Korea") (2.57%) and [Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia "Russia") (2.28%).[[215]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-218)

Special UN programmes not included in the regular budget, such as [UNICEF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNICEF "UNICEF") and the World Food Programme, are financed by voluntary contributions from member governments, corporations, and private individuals.[[216]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-219)[[217]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-220)

Assessments and reviews
-----------------------

[![Image 114](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/Friedensnobelpreis_2001_Vereinte_Nationen.jpg/250px-Friedensnobelpreis_2001_Vereinte_Nationen.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Friedensnobelpreis_2001_Vereinte_Nationen.jpg)

The [2001 Nobel Peace Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_Nobel_Peace_Prize "2001 Nobel Peace Prize") to the UN—diploma in the lobby of the [UN Headquarters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headquarters_of_the_United_Nations "Headquarters of the United Nations") in [New York City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City "New York City")

Several studies have examined the Security Council's responsiveness to armed conflict. Findings suggests that the Council is more likely to meet and deliberate on conflicts that are more intense and have led to more humanitarian suffering, but that its responsiveness is also shaped by the political interests of member states and in particular of the permanent members.[[218]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-221)

UN peacekeeping missions are assessed to be generally successful. A book looking at 47 peace operations by [Virginia Page Fortna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Page_Fortna "Virginia Page Fortna") of [Columbia University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University "Columbia University") found that UN-led conflict resolution usually resulted in long-term peace.[[219]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-222)

Political scientists Hanne Fjelde, Lisa Hultman and [Desiree Nilsson](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Desiree_Nilsson&action=edit&redlink=1 "Desiree Nilsson (page does not exist)") of [Uppsala University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uppsala_University "Uppsala University") studied twenty years of data on peacekeeping missions, concluding that they were more effective at reducing civilian casualties than counterterrorism operations by nation states.[[220]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-223)

[Georgetown University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgetown_University "Georgetown University") professor Lise Howard postulates that UN peacekeeping operations are more effective due to their emphasis on "verbal persuasion, financial inducements and coercion short of offensive military force, including surveillance and arrest", which are likelier to change the behavior of warring parties.[[153]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-:0-156)

British historian [Paul Kennedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Kennedy "Paul Kennedy") states that while the organization has suffered some major setbacks, "when all its aspects are considered, the UN has brought great benefits to our generation and will bring benefits to our children's and grandchildren's generations as well."[[221]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKennedy2007290-224)

In 2012, then French President [François Hollande](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Hollande "François Hollande") stated that "France trusts the United Nations. She knows that no state, no matter how powerful, can solve urgent problems, fight for development and bring an end to all crises. France wants the UN to be the centre of global governance".[[222]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-225) In his 1953 address to the United States Committee for United Nations Day, American President Dwight D. Eisenhower expressed his view that, for all its flaws, "the United Nations represents man's best organized hope to substitute the conference table for the battlefield".[[223]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-226)

[Jacques Fomerand](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jacques_Fomerand&action=edit&redlink=1 "Jacques Fomerand (page does not exist)"), a professor in political sciences, writes that the "accomplishments of the United Nations in the last 60 years are impressive in their own terms. Progress in human development during the 20th century has been dramatic, and the UN and its agencies have certainly helped the world become a more hospitable and livable place for millions".[[224]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFomerand2009cviii-227)

Reviewing the first 50 years of the UN's history, the author [Stanley Meisler](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stanley_Meisler&action=edit&redlink=1 "Stanley Meisler (page does not exist)") writes that "the United Nations never fulfilled the hopes of its founders, but it accomplished a great deal nevertheless", citing its role in decolonization and its many successful peacekeeping efforts.[[225]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMeisler1995339-228)

Awards
------

A number of agencies and individuals associated with the UN have won the [Nobel Peace Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Peace_Prize "Nobel Peace Prize") in recognition of their work. Two secretaries-general, Dag Hammarskjöld and Kofi Annan, were each awarded the prize; as were Ralph Bunche, a UN negotiator, René Cassin, a contributor to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the American Secretary of State [Cordell Hull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cordell_Hull "Cordell Hull") for his role in the organization's founding. [Lester B. Pearson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lester_B._Pearson "Lester B. Pearson"), the Canadian [Secretary of State for External Affairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_External_Affairs "Secretary of State for External Affairs"), was awarded the prize in 1957 for his role in organizing the UN's first peacekeeping force to resolve the Suez Crisis.

UNICEF won the prize in 1965, the [International Labour Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Labour_Organization "International Labour Organization") in 1969, the UN Peacekeeping Forces in 1988, the International Atomic Energy Agency (which reports to the UN) in 2005, and the UN-supported [Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organisation_for_the_Prohibition_of_Chemical_Weapons "Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons") in 2013. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees was awarded the prize in 1954 and 1981, becoming one of only two recipients to win the prize twice. The UN as a whole was awarded the prize in 2001, sharing it with Annan.[[226]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-229) In 2007, the [IPCC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intergovernmental_Panel_on_Climate_Change "Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change") received the prize "for their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change, and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change."[[227]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-230)

On March 21st 2025 the joint Universities of [Leuven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KU_Leuven "KU Leuven") and [Louvain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCLouvain "UCLouvain") (Belgium) awarded the UNO a [Honorary degree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honorary_degree "Honorary degree") which was given in the hands of [António Guterres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant%C3%B3nio_Guterres "António Guterres").

Criticism
---------

### Role

In a sometimes-misquoted statement, American President [George W. Bush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush "George W. Bush") stated in February 2003—referring to UN uncertainty towards Iraqi provocations under the Saddam Hussein regime—that "free nations will not allow the UN to fade into history as an ineffective, irrelevant debating society."[[228]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-231)[[229]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-232)[[230]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-233)

In 2020, former American President [Barack Obama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama "Barack Obama"), in his memoir _[A Promised Land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A\_Promised\_Land "A Promised Land")_ noted, "In the middle of the [Cold War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War "Cold War"), the chances of reaching any consensus had been slim, which is why the UN had stood idle as [Soviet tanks rolled into Hungary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_Revolution_of_1956 "Hungarian Revolution of 1956") or [U.S. planes dropped napalm on the Vietnamese countryside](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War "Vietnam War"). Even after the Cold War, divisions within the Security Council continued to hamstring the UN's ability to tackle problems. Its member states lacked either the means or the collective will to reconstruct failing states like [Somalia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somalia "Somalia"), or prevent an ethnic slaughter in places like Sri Lanka."[[231]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-234)[[232]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-235)

Since its founding, there have been many calls for [reform of the UN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reform_of_the_United_Nations "Reform of the United Nations") but little consensus on how to do so. Some want the UN to play a greater or more effective role in world affairs, while others want its role reduced to humanitarian work.

### Representation and structure

Core features of the UN apparatus, such as the [veto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_veto_power "United Nations Security Council veto power") privileges of some nations in the [Security Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Council "Security Council"), are often described as fundamentally undemocratic, contrary to the UN mission, and a main cause of inaction on genocides and [crimes against humanity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimes_against_humanity "Crimes against humanity").[[233]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-236)[[234]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-237)

Jacques Fomerand state that the most enduring divide in views of the UN is "the North–South split" between [richer Northern nations and developing Southern nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North%E2%80%93South_divide_in_the_World "North–South divide in the World"). Southern nations tend to favour a more empowered UN with a stronger General Assembly, allowing them a greater voice in world affairs, while Northern nations prefer an economically [laissez-faire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laissez-faire "Laissez-faire") UN that focuses on transnational threats such as terrorism.[[235]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFomerand2009civ-238)

There have been numerous calls for the [UN Security Council's membership to be increased](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reform_of_the_United_Nations_Security_Council "Reform of the United Nations Security Council"), for different ways of electing the UN's secretary-general, and for a [UN Parliamentary Assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Parliamentary_Assembly "United Nations Parliamentary Assembly") (UNPA).[[236]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-239)

In the context of ongoing United Nations reform discussions, Noble World Foundation (NWF) proposes changing the structure of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) by shifting membership and veto power from individual states to regional organizations like the [European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union "European Union"). This proposed shift is in line with the UNSC's existing practice of basing the selection of non-permanent members on regional representation. Shifting to regional organization-based membership in the UNSC aims to reduce deadlock caused by individual state vetoes. A prime example of this issue was observed on 25 February 2022, when Russia used its veto power to block a resolution against its invasion of Ukraine, thereby underscoring a significant weakness in the UNSC's functioning. NWF's proposal is intended to improve the effectiveness and decision-making process within the UNSC.[[237]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-240)[[238]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-241)

In response to concerns regarding the pace of progress under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), recent studies have suggested institutional reforms to enhance the integration of ecological concerns in UN decision-making processes.[[239]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-242) Scholars affiliated with the Planet Politics Institute and [The Planetary Democrats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Planetary_Democrats "The Planetary Democrats") have proposed the creation of an Earth System Council, modelled after the UNSC, and a Planetary Parliament, alongside the proposed UNPA, to provide formal representation for ecological interests within the UN system.[[240]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-243)[[241]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-244)

### Exclusion of nations

After [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II"), the [French Committee of National Liberation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Committee_of_National_Liberation "French Committee of National Liberation") was late to be recognized by the United States as the government of France, and so the country was initially excluded from the conferences that created the new organization. Future French president [Charles de Gaulle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_de_Gaulle "Charles de Gaulle") criticized the UN, famously calling it a _machin_ (contraption), and was not convinced that a [global security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_security "Global security") alliance would help maintain world peace, preferring [direct defence treaties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_relations_of_France "Foreign relations of France") between countries.[[242]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-245)

Following the [Chinese Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Civil_War "Chinese Civil War"), the government of China was disputed between the [Chinese Nationalist Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuomintang "Kuomintang") and the [Chinese Communist Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Communist_Party "Chinese Communist Party"). After the foundation of the [People's Republic of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_China "People's Republic of China") (PRC) on 1 October 1949, the government of the [Republic of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_China "Republic of China") (ROC) retreated to the island of Taiwan,[[243]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-246) continuing to claim that it was the sole government of China. After the civil war, the United Nations continued recognizing the ROC as the [official government of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_505_(VI) "United Nations General Assembly Resolution 505 (VI)"). In 1971, amid growing debate over the representation of the Chinese people on the mainland,[[244]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-247) the General Assembly passed [a resolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_2758_(XXVI) "United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758 (XXVI)") recognizing the PRC as _"the only legitimate representatives of China to the United Nations."_[[245]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-248) Critics[_[who?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual\_of\_Style/Words\_to\_watch#Unsupported\_attributions "Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch")_] allege that this position reflects a failure of the organization's development goals and guidelines,[[246]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-249) and it garnered renewed scrutiny during the [COVID-19 pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic "COVID-19 pandemic"), when Taiwan was denied membership into the World Health Organization despite its [relatively effective response to the virus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Taiwan "COVID-19 pandemic in Taiwan").[[247]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-250) Support for Taiwan's inclusion in the UN remains challenged by the People's Republic of China, which claims the territories controlled by Taiwan [as their own territory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_China "One China").[[248]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-251)

### Independence

Throughout the Cold War, both the United States and the Soviet Union repeatedly accused the UN of favouring the other. In 1950, the Soviet Union boycotted the organization in protest to [China's seat at the UN Security Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_and_the_United_Nations "China and the United Nations") being given to the anti-communist [Republic of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan "Taiwan"). Three years later, the Soviets effectively forced the resignation of UN Secretary-General [Trygve Lie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trygve_Lie "Trygve Lie") by refusing to acknowledge his administration due to his support of the [Korean War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War "Korean War").[[249]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-252)

Ironically, the United States had simultaneously scrutinized the UN for employing communists and Soviet sympathizers, following a high-profile accusation that [Alger Hiss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alger_Hiss "Alger Hiss"), an American who had taken part in the establishment of the UN, had been a Soviet spy. American Senator Joseph McCarthy claimed that the [UN Secretariat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Secretariat "United Nations Secretariat") under Secretary-General Lie harboured American communists, leading to further pressure that the UN chief resign.[[250]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-253) The United States saw nascent opposition to the UN in the 1960s, particularly amongst conservatives, with groups such as the [John Birch Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Birch_Society "John Birch Society") stating that the organization was an instrument for communism.[[251]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-254) Popular opposition to the UN was expressed through bumper stickers and signs with slogans such as "Get the U.S. out of the U.N. and the U.N. out of the U.S.!" and "You can't spell communism without U.N."[[252]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMeisler199572%E2%80%9373,_82-255)

### National sovereignty

In the United States, there were concerns about supposed threats to national sovereignty, most notably promoted by the [John Birch Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Birch_Society "John Birch Society"), which mounted a nationwide campaign in opposition to the UN during the 1960s.[[253]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-256)[[254]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-257)[[255]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-258)

Beginning in the 1990s, the same concern appeared with the [American Sovereignty Restoration Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Sovereignty_Restoration_Act "American Sovereignty Restoration Act"), which has been introduced multiple times in the [United States Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress "United States Congress"). In 1997, an amendment containing the bill received a floor vote, with 54 representatives voting in favour.[[256]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-259)[[257]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-260) The 2007 version of the bill ([H.R.1146](https://www.congress.gov/bill/110th-congress/house-bill/1146)) was authored by [U.S. Representative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Representative "U.S. Representative")[Ron Paul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Paul "Ron Paul"), to effect the United States' withdrawal from the United Nations. It would repeal various laws pertaining to the UN, terminate authorization for funds to be spent on the UN, terminate UN presence on American property, and withdraw diplomatic immunity for UN employees.[[258]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-261) It would provide up to two years for the United States to withdraw.[[259]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-lamb-262) The _[Yale Law Journal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale\_Law\_Journal "Yale Law Journal")_ cited the Act as proof that "the United States's complaints against the United Nations have intensified."[[260]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-263) The most recent iteration, As of 2022, is H.R.7806, introduced by [Mike D. Rogers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Rogers_(Alabama_politician) "Mike Rogers (Alabama politician)").[[261]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-264)

### Bias

The UN's attention to Israel's treatment of Palestinians is considered excessive by Jewish critics, including Israeli diplomat [Dore Gold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dore_Gold "Dore Gold"), British scholar [Robert S. Wistrich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_S._Wistrich "Robert S. Wistrich"), American legal scholar [Alan Dershowitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Dershowitz "Alan Dershowitz"), Australian politician [Mark Dreyfus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Dreyfus "Mark Dreyfus"), and the [Anti-Defamation League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Defamation_League "Anti-Defamation League").[[262]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-265) In September 2015, [Saudi Arabia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia "Saudi Arabia")'s Faisal bin Hassan Trad was elected chair of an advisory committee in the [UN Human Rights Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Human_Rights_Council "United Nations Human Rights Council"),[[263]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-266) a move criticized by the [UN Watch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Watch "UN Watch").[[264]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-267) The UNHRC has likewise been accused of anti-Israel bias by Ex-President of the United States [George W. Bush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush "George W. Bush"), who complained that the Council focused too much attention on Israel and not enough on countries such as Cuba, Venezuela, North Korea and Iran.[[265]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-268) American [state lawmakers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_legislature_(United_States) "State legislature (United States)") have proposed legislation to block various UN programs deemed to threaten U.S. sovereignty.[[266]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-269) In 2023, [Tennessee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee "Tennessee") enacted legislation to block the implementation of programs "originating in, or traceable to, the United Nations or a subsidiary entity of the United Nations," including [Agenda 21](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agenda_21 "Agenda 21") and [the 2030 Agenda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goals "Sustainable Development Goals").[[267]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-270)[[268]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-271) In her confirmation hearing before the Senate panel to be the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, [Elise Stefanik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elise_Stefanik "Elise Stefanik"), described the UN's attitude toward Israel as "anti-semitic" and affirmed the views of the right-wing Israeli ministers, [Bezalel Smotrich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bezalel_Smotrich "Bezalel Smotrich") and [Ben Gvir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itamar_Ben-Gvir "Itamar Ben-Gvir"), that Israel has a 'biblical right to the entire West Bank'.[[269]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-d827-272)[[270]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-273)[[271]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-274)[[272]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-275)

### Effectiveness

According to [international relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_relations "International relations") scholar [Edward Luck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Luck "Edward Luck"), the United States has preferred a feeble United Nations in major projects undertaken by the organization to forestall UN interference with, or resistance to, American policies. "The last thing the U.S. wants is an independent UN throwing its weight around", Luck said. Similarly, former [US Ambassador to the United Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Ambassador_to_the_United_Nations "US Ambassador to the United Nations")[Daniel Patrick Moynihan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Patrick_Moynihan "Daniel Patrick Moynihan") explained that "The Department of State desired that the United Nations prove utterly ineffective in whatever measures it undertook. The task was given to me, and I carried it forward with not inconsiderable success."[[273]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-276)

In 1994, former special representative of the secretary-general of the UN to Somalia [Mohamed Sahnoun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Sahnoun "Mohamed Sahnoun") published _Somalia: The Missed Opportunities_,[[274]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-277) a book in which he analyses the reasons for the failure of the 1992 UN intervention in [Somalia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somalia "Somalia"). Sahnoun claims that between the start of the Somali civil war in 1988 and the fall of the [Siad Barre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siad_Barre "Siad Barre") regime in January 1991, the UN missed at least three opportunities to prevent major human tragedies. When the UN tried to provide humanitarian assistance, they were totally outperformed by [NGOs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGO "NGO"), whose competence and dedication sharply contrasted with the UN's excessive caution and bureaucratic inefficiencies. Sahnoun warned that if radical reform were not undertaken, then the UN would continue to respond to such crises with inept improvisation.[[275]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-278)

Beyond specific instances or areas of alleged ineffectiveness, some scholars debate the overall effectiveness of the UN. Adherents to the [realist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realism_(international_relations) "Realism (international relations)") school of international relations take a pessimistic position, arguing that the UN is not an effective organization because it is dominated and constrained by great powers. [Liberal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism_(international_relations) "Liberalism (international relations)") scholars counter that it is an effective organization because it has proved capable of solving many problems by working around the restrictions imposed by powerful member states. The UN is generally considered by scholars to be more effective in realms such as public health, and humanitarian assistance.[[276]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-279) The ineffectiveness of enforcing [territorial integrity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_integrity "Territorial integrity") in the 21st century[[277]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-280) have led to debate on possible re-emergence of the [right of conquest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_conquest "Right of conquest").[[278]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-281)

### Inefficiency and corruption

Critics have also accused the UN of bureaucratic inefficiency, waste, and corruption. In 1976, the General Assembly established the [Joint Inspection Unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Inspection_Unit "Joint Inspection Unit") to seek out inefficiencies within the UN system. During the 1990s, the United States withheld dues citing inefficiency and only started repayment on the condition that a major reforms initiative be introduced. In 1994, the [Office of Internal Oversight Services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Office_of_Internal_Oversight_Services "United Nations Office of Internal Oversight Services") (or the OIOS) was established by the General Assembly to serve as an efficiency watchdog.[[279]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-282)

In 2004, the UN faced accusations that its recently ended [Oil-for-Food Programme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil-for-Food_Programme "Oil-for-Food Programme") — in which Iraq had been allowed to trade oil for basic needs to relieve the pressure of sanctions — had suffered from widespread corruption, including billions of dollars of [kickbacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kickback_(bribery) "Kickback (bribery)"). An independent inquiry created by the UN found that many of its officials had been involved in [the scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil-for-Food_Program_Hearings "Oil-for-Food Program Hearings"), and raised significant questions about the role of [Kojo Annan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kojo_Annan "Kojo Annan"), the son of [Kofi Annan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kofi_Annan "Kofi Annan").[[280]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-283)

Model United Nations
--------------------

The United Nations has inspired the extracurricular activity Model United Nations (or MUN). MUN is a simulation of United Nations activity based on the UN agenda and following UN procedure. It is usually attended by high school and university students who organize conferences to simulate the various UN committees to discuss important issues of the day.[[281]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-284) Today, MUN educates tens of thousands on the activities of the UN around the world. MUN has many famous and notable alumni, such as the former UN Secretary-General [Ban Ki-moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ban_Ki-moon "Ban Ki-moon").[[282]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-285)

Hymn to the United Nations
--------------------------

On the request of then United Nations [Secretary-General](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations "Secretary-General of the United Nations")[U Thant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U_Thant "U Thant"), a Hymn to the United Nations was performed on the occasion of its 26th anniversary, on 24 October 1971, by [Pau Casals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pau_Casals "Pau Casals"), the lyrics to which were penned by the poet [W. H. Auden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._H._Auden "W. H. Auden").[[283]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations#cite_note-286)

Thant first approached Casals, who was a personal friend, looking to create a hymn to peace and hoping for the song to be based on the preamble of the [Charter of the United Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter_of_the_United_Nations "Charter of the United Nations"). Thant later commissioned Auden to write the poem after Casals requested one to set to music. Auden completed his work in three days time. The finished work, scored for chorus and orchestra, takes approximately seven minutes to play. However, there were never any plans to adopt the song as the organization's official anthem.
