**Quotation marks**[[A]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark#cite_note-altnames-3) are [punctuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punctuation "Punctuation") marks used in pairs in various [writing systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing_system "Writing system") to identify [direct speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_speech "Direct speech"), a [quotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation "Quotation"), or a phrase. The pair consists of an opening quotation mark and a closing quotation mark, which may or may not be the same [glyph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyph "Glyph").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark#cite_note-4) Quotation marks have a variety of forms in different languages and in different media.

The single quotation mark is traced to Ancient Greek practice, adopted and adapted by monastic copyists. [Isidore of Seville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isidore_of_Seville "Isidore of Seville"), in his seventh century encyclopedia, _[Etymologiae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etymologiae "Etymologiae")_, described their use of the Greek _diplé_ (a [chevron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle_bracket "Angle bracket")):

[13] ⟩ Diple. Hanc scriptores nostri adponunt in libris ecclesiasticorum virorum ad separanda vel [ad] demonstranda testimonia sanctarum Scripturarum.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark#cite_note-5)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark#cite_note-6)[13] ⟩ Diplé. Our copyists place this sign in the books of the people of the Church, to separate or to indicate the quotations drawn from the [Holy Scriptures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Scripture "Holy Scripture").

The double quotation mark derives from a marginal notation used in fifteenth-century [manuscript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuscript "Manuscript") annotations to indicate a passage of particular importance (not necessarily a quotation); the notation was placed in the outside margin of the page and was repeated alongside each line of the passage.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark#cite_note-guilles-7) In his edition of the works of [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle "Aristotle"), which appeared in 1483 or 1484, the Milanese [Renaissance humanist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_humanist "Renaissance humanist")[Francesco Filelfo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francesco_Filelfo "Francesco Filelfo") marked literal and appropriate quotes with oblique double dashes on the left margin of each line.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark#cite_note-Castellani-8) Until then, literal quotations had been highlighted or not at the author's discretion.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark#cite_note-Castellani-8)Non-verbal loans[_[clarification needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please\_clarify "Wikipedia:Please clarify")_] were marked on the edge. After the publication of Filelfo's edition, the quotation marks for literal quotations prevailed.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark#cite_note-Castellani-8) During the seventeenth century this treatment became specific to quoted material, and it grew common, especially in Britain, to print quotation marks (now in the modern opening and closing forms) at the beginning and end of the quotation as well as in the margin; the French usage is a remnant of this. In most other languages, including English, the marginal marks dropped out of use in the last years of the eighteenth century. The usage of a pair of marks, opening and closing, at the level of lower case letters was generalized.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark#cite_note-guilles-7)

Clash between the apostrophe and curved quotation marks in a phrase meaning "the crimes of the 'good Samaritans'"

By the nineteenth century, the design and usage began to be specific to each region. In [Western Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Europe "Western Europe") the custom became to use the quotation mark pairs with the convexity of each mark aimed _outward._ In [Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain "Great Britain") those marks were elevated to the same height as the top of capital letters: “...”.

Blank space (in yellow) provoked by elevated quotation marks; some type designers consider this excessive.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark#cite_note-design_et_typo-9)

In [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Third_Republic "French Third Republic"), by the end of the nineteenth century, the marks were modified to an angular shape called _[guillemets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillemet "Guillemet")_: «...». Some authors[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark#cite_note-design_et_typo-9) claim that the reason for this was a practical one, in order to get a character that was clearly distinguishable from apostrophes, commas, and parentheses. Also, in other scripts, the angular quotation marks are distinguishable from other punctuation characters: the [Greek breathing marks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_diacritics#Breathings "Greek diacritics"), the [Armenian emphasis and apostrophe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_alphabet#Punctuation "Armenian alphabet"), the Arabic [comma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma#In_other_languages "Comma"), the [decimal separator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_mark#Other_numeral_systems "Decimal mark"), the [thousands separator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thousands_separator "Thousands separator"), etc. Other authors[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark#cite_note-design_et_typo-9) claim that the reason for this was an aesthetic one: the elevated quotation marks created extra white space before and after the word, below the quotation marks. This was considered aesthetically unpleasing, while the in-line quotation marks helped to maintain the [typographical color](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_color "Type color"), since the quotation marks had the same height and were aligned with the lower case letters.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark#cite_note-guilles-7) Nevertheless, while other languages do not insert spaces between the quotation marks and the word(s) quoted, the French usage does insert them, even if they are narrow spaces.

The _curved_ quotation marks ("66–99") usage, “...”, was exported to some non-Latin scripts, notably where there was some [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language "English language") influence, for instance in [Native American](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_languages_of_the_Americas "Indigenous languages of the Americas") scripts and [Indic scripts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmic_scripts "Brahmic scripts").[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark#cite_note-10)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark#cite_note-Deccan-Kelkar-11) On the other hand, [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_script "Greek script"), [Cyrillic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrillic_script "Cyrillic script"), [Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_script "Arabic script") and [Ethiopic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopic_script "Ethiopic script") adopted the French "angular" quotation marks, «...». The [Far East](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_East "Far East") angle bracket quotation marks, 《...》, are also a development of the in-line angular quotation marks.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

In [Central Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Europe "Central Europe"), the practice was to use the quotation mark pairs with the convexity aimed _inward._ The [German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language "German language") tradition preferred the curved quotation marks, the first one at the level of the commas, the second one at the level of the apostrophes: „...“. Alternatively, these marks could be angular and in-line with lower case letters, but still pointing inward: »...«. Some neighboring regions adopted the German curved marks tradition with lower–upper alignment, while some, e.g. [Poland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland "Poland"), adopted a variant with the convexity of the closing mark aimed rightward like the opening one, „...”.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark#cite_note-12)

[Sweden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden "Sweden") (and [Finland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland "Finland")) choose a convention where the convexity of both marks was aimed to the right but lined up both at the top level: ”...”.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

In [Eastern Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Europe "Eastern Europe"),[_[clarification needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please\_clarify "Wikipedia:Please clarify")_] there was hesitation between the French tradition «...» and the German tradition „...“.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] The French tradition prevailed in [Eastern Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Europe "Eastern Europe") (Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus), whereas the German tradition, or its modified version with the convexity of the closing mark aimed rightward, has become dominant in [Southeastern Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_Europe "Southeastern Europe"), e.g. in the Balkan countries.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] In [Romania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania "Romania") the: „...” version is officially recognized by the Romanian Academy.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

In some languages using the angular quotation marks, the usage of the single guillemet, ‹...›, became obsolete, being replaced by double curved ones: “...”, though the single ones still survive, for instance, in Switzerland. In Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, the curved quotation marks, „...“, are used as a secondary level or in handwriting, while the angular marks, «...», are used as the primary level on printed text.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

In English writing, quotation marks are placed in pairs around a word or phrase to indicate:

*   [Quotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation "Quotation") or [direct speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_speech "Direct speech"): Carol said "Go ahead" when I asked her if the launcher was ready.
*   Mention in another work of the [title](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_(publishing) "Title (publishing)") of a short or subsidiary work, such as a chapter or an episode: "Encounter at Farpoint" was the pilot episode of _Star Trek: The Next Generation_.
*   [Scare quotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scare_quotes "Scare quotes"), used to mean "[so-called](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/so-called "wikt:so-called")" or to express [sarcasm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcasm "Sarcasm"): The "fresh" bread was all dried up.

In American writing, quotation marks are normally the double kind (the primary style). If quotation marks are used inside another pair of quotation marks, then single quotation marks are used. For example: "Didn't she say 'I like red best' when I asked her wine preferences?" he asked his guests. If another set of quotation marks is nested inside single quotation marks, double quotation marks are used again, and they continue to alternate as necessary (though this is rarely done).

British publishing is regarded as more flexible about whether double or single quotation marks should be used.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark#cite_note-Walker-13) A tendency to use single quotation marks in British writing is thought to have arisen after the mid-19th century invention of steam-powered presses and the consequent rise of London and New York as distinct, industrialized publishing centers whose publishing houses adhered to separate norms.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark#cite_note-14)_[The King's English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_King%27s\_English "The King's English")_ in 1908 noted that the prevailing British practice was to use double marks for most purposes, and single ones for quotations within quotations.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark#cite_note-15) Different media now follow different conventions in the United Kingdom.

Different varieties and styles of English have different conventions regarding whether terminal punctuation should be written [inside or outside](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_quotation "Logical quotation") the quotation marks. North American printing usually puts full stops and commas (but not colons, semicolons, exclamation or question marks) inside the closing quotation mark, whether it is part of the original quoted material or not.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark#cite_note-16)[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark#cite_note-17) Styles elsewhere vary widely and have different rationales for placing it inside or outside, often a matter of [house style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_guide "Style guide").

Regarding their appearance, two shape classifications of quotation marks are used in English-language texts:

*   '...' and "..." are known as neutral, vertical, straight, typewriter, dumb or [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII "ASCII") quotation marks. The left and right marks are identical. These are the symbols found on typical [QWERTY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTY "QWERTY") keyboards, although they are sometimes [automatically converted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocorrection "Autocorrection") to the other type by software.
*   ‘...’ and “...” are known as typographic, curly, curved, book, or smart quotation marks. (The doubled ones are more informally known as "66 and 99".[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark#cite_note-18)[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark#cite_note-19)) The beginning marks are commas raised to the top of the line and rotated 180 degrees. The ending marks are commas raised to the top of the line. Curved quotation marks are used mainly in [manuscript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuscript "Manuscript"), printing, and [typesetting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typesetting "Typesetting"). [Type cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_case "Type case") (of any language) generally have the curved quotation mark metal types for the respective language, and may lack the vertical quotation mark metal types. Because most computer keyboards lack keys to enter typographic quotation marks directly, much that is written using [word-processing programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_processor_program "Word processor program") has vertical quotation marks. The "[smart quotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_quotes "Smart quotes")" feature in some computer software can convert vertical quotation marks to curly ones, although sometimes imperfectly.

The closing or [right single quotation mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_single_quotation_mark "Right single quotation mark") is identical in form to the [apostrophe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe "Apostrophe") and similar to the [prime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_(symbol) "Prime (symbol)") symbol. The double quotation mark is identical to the [ditto mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ditto_mark "Ditto mark") in English-language usage. It is also similar to—and often used to represent—the [double prime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_prime "Double prime") symbol. These all serve different purposes.

*   [![Image 6: A type case containing sorts of movable type](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Upper_case_and_lower_case_types.jpg/250px-Upper_case_and_lower_case_types.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Upper_case_and_lower_case_types.jpg "A type case containing sorts of movable type")

Specific language features
--------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Quotation_mark&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Specific language features")]

Contemporary Bulgarian employs the [em dash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Em_dash "Em dash") or the quotation dash (the [horizontal bar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark#Quotation_dash)) followed by a space character at the beginning of each direct-speech segment by a different character in order to mark [direct speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_speech "Direct speech") in prose and in most journalistic question and answer [interviews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview "Interview"); in such cases, the use of standard quotation marks is left for in-text citations or to mark the names of institutions, companies, and sometimes also brand or model names.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

[Air quotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_quotes "Air quotes") are also widely used in face-to-face communication in contemporary Bulgarian but usually resemble `" ... "` (secondary: `' ... '`) unlike written Bulgarian quotation marks.

The standard form in the preceding table is taught in schools and used in handwriting. Most large newspapers have kept these low-high quotation marks, „ and ”; otherwise, the alternative form with single or double English-style quotes is now often the only form seen in printed matter. Neutral (straight) quotation marks, " and ', are used widely, especially in texts typed on computers and on websites.[[76]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark#cite_note-96)

Although not generally common in the [Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands "Netherlands") any more, double angle (guillemet) quotation marks are still sometimes used in Belgium. Examples include the Flemish [HUMO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HUMO "HUMO") magazine and the Metro newspaper in Brussels.[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark#cite_note-97)

Different forms of German and English quotation marks and similar looking signs

The symbol used as the left (typographical) quote in English is used as the right quote in [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany "Germany") and [Austria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria "Austria") and a "low double comma" „ (not used in English) is used for the left quote. Its single quote form ‚ looks like a comma.

| Samples | [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode "Unicode") (decimal) | HTML | Description | Wrong Symbols |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ‚A‘ | * U+201A (8218) * U+2018 (8216) | * &sbquo; * &lsquo; | German single quotes (left and right) | * , – comma (U + 002C) left * ' – apostrophe (U+0027) right |
| „A“ | * U+201E (8222) * U+201C (8220) | * &bdquo; * &ldquo; | German double quotes (left and right) | " – neutral (vertical) double quotes (U+0022) |

Some fonts, e.g. [Verdana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verdana "Verdana"), were not designed with the flexibility to use an English left quote as a German right quote. Such fonts are therefore typographically incompatible with this German usage.

Double quotes are standard for denoting speech in [German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language "German language").

_Andreas fragte mich: „Hast du den Artikel ‚EU-Erweiterung‘ gelesen?“_ (Andreas asked me: "Have you read the 'EU Expansion' article?")

This style of quoting is also used in [Bulgarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgarian_language "Bulgarian language"), [Czech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_language "Czech language"), [Danish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danish_language "Danish language"), [Estonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estonian_language "Estonian language"), [Georgian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgian_language "Georgian language"), [Icelandic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icelandic_language "Icelandic language"), [Latvian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latvian_language "Latvian language"), [Lithuanian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_language "Lithuanian language"), [Russian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language "Russian language"), [Serbo-Croatian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbo-Croatian_language "Serbo-Croatian language"), [Slovak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovak_language "Slovak language"), [Slovene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovene_language "Slovene language") and in [Ukrainian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_language "Ukrainian language"). In Bulgarian, Icelandic, Estonian, Lithuanian, and Russian, single quotation marks are not used.[_[clarification needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please\_clarify "Wikipedia:Please clarify")_]

Sometimes, especially in novels, guillemets (angled quotation marks) are used in Germany and Austria (but pointing in the opposite direction compared to [French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_(language) "French (language)")): »A ›B‹?«

_Andreas fragte mich: »Hast du den Artikel ›EU-Erweiterung‹gelesen?«_

 Andreas asked me: "Have you read the 'EU Expansion' article?"

In [Switzerland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland "Switzerland"), the [French-style angle quotation mark sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark#French) are also used for [German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language "German language") printed text: «A ‹B›?»

_Andreas fragte mich: «Hast du den Artikel ‹EU-Erweiterung› gelesen?»_

 Andreas asked me: 'Have you read the "EU Expansion" article?'

### Finnish and Swedish

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Quotation_mark&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Finnish and Swedish")]

In [Finnish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnish_language "Finnish language") and [Swedish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_language "Swedish language"), right quotes, called citation marks, ”...”, are used to mark both the beginning and the end of a quote. Double right-pointing angular quotes, »...», can also be used.

Alternatively, an [en-dash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/En-dash "En-dash") followed by a ([non-breaking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-breaking_space "Non-breaking space")) space can be used to denote the beginning of quoted speech, in which case the end of the quotation is not specifically denoted (see section [Quotation dash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark#Quotation_dash) below). A line-break should not be allowed between the en-dash and the first word of the quotation.

| Samples | [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode "Unicode") (decimal) | HTML | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ’A’ | U+2019 (8217) | &rsquo; | Secondary level quotation |
| ”A” | U+201D (8221) | &rdquo; | Primary level quotation |
| »A» | U+00BB (187) | &raquo; | Alternative primary level quotation |
| –A | U+2013 (8211) | &ndash; | Alternative denotation at the beginning of quoted speech |

[French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language "French language") uses angle quotation marks ([guillemets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillemet "Guillemet"), or _duck-foot quotes_), adding a 'quarter-em space'[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark#cite_note-98) within the quotes. With proper localization, computers automatically add the proper spacing. When localization is not available, many people use a [non-breaking space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-breaking_space "Non-breaking space") between the quotation mark and the nearest word inside it[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] because the difference between a non-breaking space and a [four-per-em space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitespace_character#Unicode "Whitespace character") is virtually imperceptible, many [computer fonts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_fonts "Computer fonts") do not include a quarter-em space, and the Unicode quarter-em space is [breakable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_wrap_and_word_wrap "Line wrap and word wrap"). Even more commonly, many people put a normal (breaking) space inside the quotation marks[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] because the non-breaking space cannot be accessed easily from the keyboard, or because they are not aware of this typographical refinement. Using a breakable space of any kind often results in a quotation mark appearing alone at the beginning of a line, since the quotation mark is erroneously treated as an independent word.

_«Voulez-vous un sandwich, Henri?»_

 “Would you like a sandwich, Henri?”

French news sites such as _[Libération](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lib%C3%A9ration "Libération")_, _[Les Échos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les\_%C3%89chos\_(France) "Les Échos (France)")_ and _[Le Figaro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le\_Figaro "Le Figaro")_ do not add manual spacing, leaving it up to localization and the browser to space the guillemets properly.

[![Image 9](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/Guillemets_%28Imprimerie_nationale%2C_1934%29.png/250px-Guillemets_%28Imprimerie_nationale%2C_1934%29.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Guillemets_(Imprimerie_nationale,_1934).png)

Guillemets by the [Imprimerie nationale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imprimerie_nationale "Imprimerie nationale") in _Bulletin de l’Agence générale des colonies_, No. 302, Mai 1934, showing the [comma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma "Comma")-shaped symbols sitting on the [baseline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseline_(typography) "Baseline (typography)")

Initially, the French guillemets were not angle shaped but also used the comma (6/9) shape.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] They were different from English quotes because they were standing (like today's guillemets) _on_ the baseline (like lowercase letters), not raised above it (like apostrophes and English quotation marks) or hanging below it (like commas). At the beginning of the nineteenth century, this shape evolved to look like ((small parentheses)). The angle shape was introduced later to make them easier to distinguish from apostrophes, commas and parentheses in handwritten manuscripts submitted to publishers. [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode "Unicode") currently does not provide alternate codes for these 6/9 guillemets on the baseline, as they are considered to be form variants of guillemets, implemented in older French typography (such as the [Didot font](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didot_(typeface) "Didot (typeface)") design). With this older style there was also not necessarily any distinction of shape between the opening and closing guillemets; both often pointed to the right (as today's French closing guillemets do).[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

In old-style printed books, when quotations span multiple lines of text (including multiple paragraphs), an additional closing quotation sign is traditionally used at the _beginning_ of each line continuing a quotation; this right-pointing guillemet at the beginning of a line does **not** close the current quotation. This convention was consistently used from the beginning of the 19th century by most book printers, but is no longer in use today. Such insertion of continuation quotation marks was rigidly maintained, even at a word hyphenation break. Since these continuation marks are obsolete in French, there is no support for automatic insertion of continuation guillemets in HTML or CSS, nor in word-processors. Old-style typesetting is emulated by breaking up the final layout with manual line breaks, and inserting the quotation marks at line start, much like pointy brackets before quoted plain text e-mail:

_«C’est une belle journée pour les Montréalais, soutient

» le ministre. Ces investissements stimuleront la crois-

» sance économique.»_

Unlike English, French does not identify unquoted material within a quotation by using a second set of quotation marks. Compare:

_«C’est une belle journée pour les Montréalais, soutient le ministre. Ces investissements stimuleront la croissance économique.»_

 "This is a great day for Montrealers", the minister maintained. "These investments will stimulate economic growth."

For clarity, some newspapers put nested quoted material in italics:

«_C’est une belle journée pour les Montréalais,_ soutient le ministre. _Ces investissements stimuleront la croissance économique._»

The French Imprimerie nationale (cf. _Lexique des règles typographiques en usage à l'Imprimerie nationale_, presses de l'Imprimerie nationale, Paris, 2002) does not use different quotation marks for nesting quotes:

_«Son «explication» n’est qu’un mensonge», s’indigna le député._

 "His 'explanation' is just a lie", the deputy protested.

In this case, when there should be two adjacent opening or closing marks, only one is written:

_Il répondit: «Ce n’est qu’un «gadget!»._

 He answered: "It's only a 'gizmo'."

The use of English quotation marks is increasing in French and usually follows English rules, for instance in situations when the keyboard or the software context doesn't allow the use of guillemets. The French news site _[L'Humanité](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27Humanit%C3%A9 "L'Humanité")_ uses straight quotation marks along with angle ones.

English quotes are also used sometimes for nested quotations:

_«Son “explication” n’est qu’un mensonge», s’indigna le député._

 "His 'explanation' is just a lie", the deputy protested.

But the most frequent convention used in printed books for nested quotations is to style them in italics. Single quotation marks are much more rarely used, and multiple levels of quotations using the same marks is often considered confusing for readers:

«Son _explication_ n’est qu’un mensonge», s’indigna le député.

Il répondit: «Ce n’est qu’un _gadget_!».

Further, running dialogue does not use quotation marks beyond the first sentence, as changes in speaker are indicated by a dash, as opposed to the English use of closing and re-opening the quotation. (For other languages employing dashes, see section [Quotation dash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark#Quotation_dash) below.) The dashes may be used entirely without quotation marks as well. In general, quotation marks are extended to encompass as much speech as possible, including not just unspoken text such as "he said" (as previously noted), but also as long as the conversion extends. The quotation marks end at the last word of spoken text (rather than extending to the end of the paragraph) when the final part is not spoken.

_«Je ne vous parle pas, monsieur, dit-il._

_—Mais je vous parle, moi!» s’écria le jeune homme exaspéré de ce mélange d’insolence et de bonnes manières, de convenance et de dédain._ ([Dumas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandre_Dumas,_p%C3%A8re "Alexandre Dumas, père"), _[Les trois mousquetaires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Three\_Musketeers "The Three Musketeers")_)

"I am not speaking to you, sir", he said.

"But _I_ am speaking to you!" cried the young man, exasperated by this combination of insolence and good manners, of protocol and disdain.

[Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language "Greek language") uses angled quotation marks (**[εισαγωγικά](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%B5%CE%B9%CF%83%CE%B1%CE%B3%CF%89%CE%B3%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%AC "wikt:εισαγωγικά")** – _isagogiká_):

«Μιλάει σοβαρά;» ρώτησε την Μαρία.

«Ναι, σίγουρα», αποκρίθηκε.

and the [quotation dash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark#Quotation_dash) (**[παύλα](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CF%80%CE%B1%CF%8D%CE%BB%CE%B1 "wikt:παύλα")** – _pávla_):

― Μιλάει σοβαρά; ρώτησε την Μαρία.

― Ναι, σίγουρα, αποκρίθηκε.

which translate to:

"Is he serious?" he asked Maria.

 "Yes, certainly," she replied.

A closing quotation mark, », is added to the beginning of each new paragraph within a quotation.

» εγχείρημα που έχει συσταθεί στο Διαδίκτυο, παγκόσμιο, πολύγλωσσο,

» που λειτουργεί με την αρχή του wiki.»

When quotations are nested, the nested parts use English-style quotation marks, double and then (if necessary) single: «...“...‘...’...”...».[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark#cite_note-el-2-56)

According to current recommendation by the [Hungarian Academy of Sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_Academy_of_Sciences "Hungarian Academy of Sciences") the main Hungarian quotation marks are comma-shaped double quotation marks set on the base-line at the beginning of the quote and at apostrophe-height at the end of it for first level, („Quote”), reversed »French quotes«without space (the German tradition) for the second level, and thus the following nested quotation pattern emerges:

*   „Quote »inside«quote”

... and with third level:

*   „Quote »inside ’inside of inside’ inside«quote”

In Hungarian linguistic tradition the meaning of a word is signified by _uniform (unpaired)_ apostrophe-shaped quotation marks:

*   _die Biene_ ’méh’

A [quotation dash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark#Quotation_dash) is also used, and is predominant in [belletristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belletristic "Belletristic") literature.

In Israel, the traditional practice in printing and handwriting is to use „low-high” quote marks.[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark#cite_note-he-1-57) Since the 2000s, the plain quotes have become more common.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] The 2013 revision of the SI-1452 standard for [Hebrew keyboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_keyboard "Hebrew keyboard"), available since 2012 in Windows 8 and in desktop Linux systems, supports both systems, as does the [Gboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gboard "Gboard") keyboard for touchscreen devices.

The reason given is: The PN-83/P-55366 standard was withdrawn in 2014, according to Polish Wikipedia. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information._(March 2024)_

According to current [PN-83/P-55366](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=PN-83/P-55366&action=edit&redlink=1 "PN-83/P-55366 (page does not exist)") standard from 1983 (but not dictionaries, see below), _Typesetting rules for composing Polish text_ (_Zasady składania tekstów w języku polskim_) one can use either „ordinary Polish quotes” or «French quotes» (without space) for first level, and ‚single Polish quotes’ or «French quotes» for second level, which gives three styles of nested quotes:

1.   „Quote ‚inside’ quote”
2.   „Quote «inside» quote”
3.   «Quote ‚inside’ quote»

There is no space on the internal side of quote marks, with the exception of 1⁄4 _[firet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Em\_(typography)#Firet "Em (typography)")_ (≈ 1⁄4[em](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Em_(typography) "Em (typography)")) space between two quotation marks when there are no other characters between them (e.g. ,„ and ’”).

The above rules have not changed since at least the previous [BN-76/7440-02](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=BN-76/7440-02&action=edit&redlink=1 "BN-76/7440-02 (page does not exist)") standard from 1976 and are probably much older.

These rules on the use of guillemets conflict with the ones given by Polish dictionaries, including the _Wielki Słownik Ortograficzny PWN_ recommended by the [Polish Language Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_Language_Council "Polish Language Council"). The PWN rules state:

> In specific uses, guillemets also appear. Guillemet marks pointing inwards are used for highlights and in case a quotation occurs inside a quotation. Guillemet marks pointing outwards are used for definitions (mainly in scientific publications and dictionaries), as well as for enclosing spoken lines and indirect speech, especially in poetic texts.[[78]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark#cite_note-99)

In Polish printed books and publications, this dictionary-recommended style for guillemets (also known as »German quotes«) is used almost exclusively. In addition to being standard for second level quotes, guillemet quotes are sometimes used as first level quotes in headings and titles, but almost never for ordinary text in paragraphs.

Another style of quoting is to use an [em-dash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Em-dash "Em-dash") to open a quote; this is used almost exclusively for quoting dialogues rather than for single statements, and is virtually always the one used for that purpose in works of fiction.

Mag skłonił się. Biały kot śpiący obok paleniska ocknął się nagle i spojrzał na niego badawczo.

— Jak się nazywa ta wieś, panie? — zapytał przybysz. Kowal wzruszył ramionami.

 — Głupi Osioł.

 — Głupi...?

 — Osioł — powtórzył kowal takim tonem, jakby wyzywał gościa, żeby spróbował sobie z niego zażartować. Mag zamyślił się.

 — Ta nazwa ma pewnie swoją historię — stwierdził w końcu. — W innych okolicznościach chętnie bym jej wysłuchał. Ale chciałbym porozmawiać z tobą, kowalu, o twoim synu.

The wizard bowed. A white cat that had been sleeping by the furnace woke up and watched him carefully.

 “What is the name of this place, sir?” said the wizard.

 The blacksmith shrugged.

 “Stupid Donkey,” he said. [original English version is "Bad Ass", but that's not a common phrase in Polish]

 “Stupid—?”

 “Donkey,” repeated the blacksmith, his tone defying anyone to make something of it.

 The wizard considered this.

 “A name with a story behind it,” he said at last, “which were circumstances otherwise I would be pleased to hear. But I would like to speak to you, smith, about your son.”

(— [Terry Pratchett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Pratchett "Terry Pratchett"), _Equal Rites_)

An [en-dash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/En-dash "En-dash") is sometimes used in place of the [em-dash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Em-dash "Em-dash"), especially so in newspaper texts.

In [Portugal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal "Portugal"), angular quotation marks[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark#cite_note-pt-aspas-77)[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark#cite_note-pt-Prontu%C3%A1rio_Ortogr%C3%A1fico-82) (ex. «quote») are traditionally used. They are the Latin tradition quotation marks, normally used by typographers, and are also the usual style in reference sources,[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark#cite_note-infopedia-81)[[79]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark#cite_note-100)[[80]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark#cite_note-Cunha-101) as well as on some websites dedicated to the Portuguese language.[[81]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark#cite_note-102)

The _Código de Redação_[[82]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark#cite_note-CRI-103) for Portuguese-language documents published in the European Union prescribes three levels of quotation marks, «...“...‘...’...”...»:

_E estava escrito «Alguém perguntou “Quem foi que gritou ‘Meu Deus!’?”.» na folha de papel._

And it was written “Someone asked ‘Who shouted “My God!”?’.” on the sheet of paper.

*   in black: main sentence which contains the quotations;
*   in green: 1st level quotation;
*   in red: 2nd level quotation;
*   in blue: 3rd level quotation;

The usage of curved quotation marks (ex. “quote” and ‘quote’) is growing in Portugal,[[83]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark#cite_note-altas-104)[_[better source needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTRS "Wikipedia:NOTRS")_] probably due to the omnipresence of the English language and to the corresponding difficulty (or even inability) to enter angular quotation marks on some machines (mobile phones, cash registers, calculators, etc.).

In [Brazil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil "Brazil"), angular quotation marks are rare, and curved quotation marks (“quote” and ‘quote’) are almost always used. An example of this can be seen in the difference between a [Portuguese keyboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_QWERTY_keyboard_language_variants#Portugal "List of QWERTY keyboard language variants") (which has a key for « and ») and a [Brazilian keyboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_QWERTY_keyboard_language_variants#Brazil "List of QWERTY keyboard language variants").

The [Portuguese-speaking African countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese-speaking_African_countries "Portuguese-speaking African countries") tend to follow Portugal's conventions, not the Brazilian ones.

Other usages of quotation marks (“quote„ for double, ‹quote› for single) are obsolete in Portuguese.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_].

In [Belarusian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belarusian_language "Belarusian language"), [Russian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language "Russian language"), and [Ukrainian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_language "Ukrainian language"), the angled quotation ([Belarusian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belarusian_language "Belarusian language"): «двукоссе», [Russian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language "Russian language"): «кавычки», [Ukrainian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_language "Ukrainian language"): «лапки») marks are used without spaces. In case of quoted material inside a quotation, rules and most noted style manuals prescribe the use of different kinds of quotation marks.

Example in Russian:

Пушкин писал Дельвигу: «Жду „Цыганов“ и тотчас тисну».

([Pushkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushkin "Pushkin") wrote to Delvig: "Waiting for '[Gypsies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gypsies_(poem) "The Gypsies (poem)")', and publish at once.")

Example in Ukrainian:

«І, звісно, не обійтись без користування словником. Один мій знайомий поет і літературознавець якось жартуючи сказав: “Я волію читати словники, ніж поеми. У словнику ті самі слова, що і в поемі, але подані в систематизованому порядку”. Це сказано жартома, але “читати словники” — не така вже дивовижна і дивацька річ, як може здатися».

("And, of course, you can't avoid using a dictionary. One of my acquaintances, a poet and literary critic, once jokingly said: 'I prefer to read dictionaries than poems. The dictionary has the same words as in the poem, but is presented in a systematic way'. It's a joke, but 'reading dictionaries' is not as amazing and bizarre as it may seem.")

[Spanish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_(language) "Spanish (language)") uses angled quotation marks (_comillas latinas_ or _angulares_), with no space between the quotation mark and the quoted material.

_«Esto es un ejemplo de cómo se suele hacer una cita literal en español»._

 "This is an example of how a literal quotation is usually written in Spanish."

When quotations are nested in more levels than inner and outer quotation, the system is:[[84]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark#cite_note-105)

_«Antonio me dijo: “Vaya ‘cacharro’ que se ha comprado Julián”»._

 "Antonio told me, 'What a piece of "junk" Julián has purchased for himself'".

The use of English quotation marks is increasing in Spanish;[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] the _[El País](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El\_Pa%C3%ADs "El País")_ style guide, which is widely followed in Spain, recommends them. [Hispanic Americans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanic_America "Hispanic America") often use them, owing to influence from the United States.

### Chinese, Japanese and Korean

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Quotation_mark&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: Chinese, Japanese and Korean")]

Corner brackets are well-suited for [Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language "Chinese language"), [Japanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language "Japanese language"), and [Korean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_language "Korean language") languages, because they accommodate [vertical and horizontal writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_and_vertical_writing_in_East_Asian_scripts "Horizontal and vertical writing in East Asian scripts") equally well. China, South Korea, and Japan all use corner brackets when writing vertically. Usage differs when writing horizontally:

*   In [Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan "Japan"), corner brackets are used.
*   In [South Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea "South Korea"), corner brackets and English-style quotes are used.
*   In [North Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea "North Korea"), angle quotes are used.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]
*   In [mainland China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainland_China "Mainland China"), English-style quotes (full width “ ”) are official and prevalent; corner brackets are rare today. The Unicode code points used are the English quotes (rendered as fullwidth by the font), not the fullwidth forms.
*   In [Taiwan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan "Taiwan"), [Hong Kong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong "Hong Kong") and [Macau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macau "Macau"), where [traditional characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_characters "Traditional characters") are used, corner brackets are prevalent, although English-style quotes are also used.
*   In the Chinese language, double angle brackets are placed around titles of books, documents, movies, pieces of art or music, magazines, newspapers, laws, etc. When nested, single angle brackets are used inside double angle brackets. With some exceptions, this usage parallels the usage of italics in English:

「你看過《三國演義》嗎？」他問我。"Have you read _[Romance of the Three Kingdoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance\_of\_the\_Three\_Kingdoms "Romance of the Three Kingdoms")_?", he asked me.
When corner brackets are being used for quotations, quote-within-quote segments are marked with white corner brackets.

Another typographical style is to omit quotation marks for lines of dialogue, replacing them with an initial dash, as in lines from James Joyce's _[Ulysses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses\_(novel) "Ulysses (novel)")_:

― O saints above! Miss Douce said, sighed above her jumping rose. I wished I hadn't laughed so much. I feel all wet.

 ― O Miss Douce! Miss Kennedy protested. You horrid thing![[85]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark#cite_note-107)

This style is particularly common in Bulgarian, French, Greek, Hungarian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish, and Vietnamese.[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark#cite_note-Vietnamese-95)[James Joyce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Joyce "James Joyce") always insisted on this style, although his publishers did not always respect his preference. [Alan Paton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Paton "Alan Paton") used this style in _[Cry, the Beloved Country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cry,\_the\_Beloved\_Country "Cry, the Beloved Country")_ (and no quotation marks at all in some of his later work). [Charles Frazier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Frazier "Charles Frazier") used this style for his novel _[Cold Mountain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold\_Mountain\_(novel) "Cold Mountain (novel)")_ as well. Details for individual languages are given above.

The dash is often combined with ordinary quotation marks. For example, in French, a guillemet may be used to initiate running speech, with a dash to indicate each change in speaker and a closing guillemet to mark the end of the quotation.

Dashes are also used in many modern [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language "English language")[novels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel "Novel"), especially those written in [nonstandard dialects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonstandard_dialect "Nonstandard dialect"). Some examples include:

*   James Joyce's prose
*   [William Gaddis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Gaddis "William Gaddis")' prose
*   _[Trainspotting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trainspotting\_(novel) "Trainspotting (novel)")_ by [Irvine Welsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irvine_Welsh "Irvine Welsh")
*   _[M/F](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M/F "M/F")_ by [Anthony Burgess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Burgess "Anthony Burgess")
*   _[The Book of Dave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Book\_of\_Dave "The Book of Dave")_ by [Will Self](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Self "Will Self"), which alternates between standard English chapters, with standard quotation marks, and dialect chapters, with quotation dashes
*   _[A Scanner Darkly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A\_Scanner\_Darkly "A Scanner Darkly")_ by [Philip K. Dick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_K._Dick "Philip K. Dick") (not written in dialect)
*   [The Ægypt Sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%86gypt "Ægypt") by [John Crowley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Crowley_(author) "John Crowley (author)"), in extracts from the fictional writings of the character Fellowes Kraft, a [historical novelist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_fiction "Historical fiction"). According to another character, Kraft used dashes to indicate imaginary dialogue that was not documented in the original sources.
*   _[The Van](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Van\_(novel) "The Van (novel)")_ by [Roddy Doyle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roddy_Doyle "Roddy Doyle")
*   _[You Shall Know Our Velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You\_Shall\_Know\_Our\_Velocity "You Shall Know Our Velocity")_ by [Dave Eggers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Eggers "Dave Eggers"), in which spoken dialogues are written with the typical English quotation marks, but dialogues imagined by the main character (which feature prominently) are written with quotation dashes
*   _[A Winter in the Hills](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=A\_Winter\_in\_the\_Hills&action=edit&redlink=1 "A Winter in the Hills (page does not exist)")_ by [John Wain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wain "John Wain") in which conversations in English are indicated by ordinary quotation marks and in Welsh by quotation dashes

In Italian, Catalan, Portuguese, Spanish, Ukrainian, Russian, Polish, Bulgarian, Georgian, Romanian, Lithuanian and Hungarian, a reporting clause in the middle of a quotation is marked by a dash on each side of it. The initial quotation dash is followed by a single space, and any other quotation dashes in the same paragraph have a single space on each side. A Russian example:

― Ай, ай, ай! ― вскрикнул Левин. ― Я ведь, кажется, уже лет девять не говел. Я и не подумал.

― Хорош! ― смеясь, сказал Степан Аркадьевич, ― а меня же называешь нигилистом! Однако ведь это нельзя. Тебе надо говеть.

"Oh dear!" exclaimed Levin. "I think it is nine years since I went to communion! I haven't thought about it."

 "You are a good one!" remarked Oblonsky, laughing. "And you call me a Nihilist! But it won't do, you know; you must confess and receive the sacrament."

(— from [Leo Tolstoy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Tolstoy "Leo Tolstoy")’s _[Anna Karenina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna\_Karenina "Anna Karenina")_, Louise and Aylmer Maude translation)

A Hungarian example:

_– Nem hagyják magukat, mozgásban maradnak – mondta Ron. – Ahogy mi is._

"Well, they keep on the move, don't they?" said Ron. "Like us."

(— From J. K. Rowling's _[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry\_Potter\_and\_the\_Deathly\_Hallows "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows")_ and its Hungarian translation by Tóth Tamás Boldizsár)

In [Finnish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnish_language "Finnish language"), on the other hand, the beginning of a reporting clause is marked only by the punctuation already existing in the sentence, or (if there was none) by adding a comma. When a quote continues after the reporting clause, the clause ends with a comma, and the continuation begins with another dash:[[86]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark#cite_note-108)

– Et sinä ole paljon minkään näköinen, sanoi Korkala melkein surullisesti, – mutta ei auta.

"You don't seem to be anything special," said Korkala almost sadly, "but there's no help to it."

– Frakki, älähti Huikari. – Missä on frakki?

 – Räätälissä, sanoi Joonas rauhallisesti.

"Tailcoat", yelped Huikari. "Where is the tailcoat?"

"At the tailor's", said Joonas calmly.

The [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode "Unicode") standard introduced a separate character U+2015―HORIZONTAL BAR to be used as a quotation dash. It may be the same length as an em-dash, which is often used instead. Some software will allow a line break after an ordinary em-dash, but prevent it after a quotation dash. Both are displayed in the following table.

| Samples | [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode "Unicode") (decimal) | HTML | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ―A | U+2015 (8213) | &horbar; | Quotation dash, also known as [horizontal bar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dash#Horizontal_bar "Dash") |
| —A | U+2014 (8212) | &mdash; | [Em-dash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Em_dash "Em dash"), an alternative to the quotation dash |
| –A | U+2013 (8211) | &ndash; | [En-dash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/En_dash "En dash"), used instead of em-dash for quotation dash in some languages (e.g. Swedish) |

Electronic documents
--------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Quotation_mark&action=edit&section=21 "Edit section: Electronic documents")]

Different [typefaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typeface "Typeface"), [character encodings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_encoding "Character encoding") and [computer languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_language "Computer language") use various encodings and glyphs for quotation marks.

### Typewriters and early computers

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Quotation_mark&action=edit&section=22 "Edit section: Typewriters and early computers")]

'Ambidextrous' or 'straight' quotation marks ' " were introduced on [typewriters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typewriter "Typewriter") to minimise the number of keys on the keyboard, and were inherited by [computer keyboards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_keyboard "Computer keyboard") and [character sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_set "Character set"). The [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII "ASCII") character set, which has been used on a wide variety of computers since the 1960s, contains the straight versions only (U+0027'[APOSTROPHE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe "Apostrophe") and U+0022"QUOTATION MARK).

Many systems, such as the [personal computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer "Personal computer") of the 1980s and early 1990s, actually drew these ASCII quotes like closing quotes on-screen and in printouts, so text would _appear_ like this (approximately):

″Good morning, Dave,″ said HAL.

 ′Good morning, Dave,′ said HAL.

These same systems often drew the [backtick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtick "Backtick") (the free standing character U+0060`[GRAVE ACCENT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtick "Backtick")) as an 'open quote' glyph (usually a mirror image so it still sloped in the direction of a grave accent). Using this character as the opening quote gave a [typographic approximation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typographic_approximation "Typographic approximation") of curved single quotes. Nothing similar was available for the double quote, so many people resorted to using two single quotes for double quotes, which would _look_ approximately like the following:

``Good morning, Dave,′′ said HAL.

 `Good morning, Dave,′ said HAL.

The typesetting application [TeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX "TeX") uses this convention for input files. The following is an example of TeX input which yields proper curly quotation marks.

```Good morning, Dave,'' said HAL.```Good morning, Dave,' said HAL.`
The [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode "Unicode") standard added [codepoints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codepoint "Codepoint") for slanted or curved quotes (U+201C“LEFT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK and U+201D”RIGHT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK, described further below), shown here for comparison:

“Good morning, Dave,” said HAL.

 ‘Good morning, Dave,’ said HAL.

The Unicode mapping for [PostScript Standard Encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript_Standard_Encoding "PostScript Standard Encoding") preserves the typographic approximation convention by mapping its equivalent of ASCII grave and single-quote to the Unicode curly quotation mark characters.

On most keyboards, typographical quotation marks are absent.

When typewriter keyboards were designed, curved quotation marks were not implemented. Instead, to limit the number of characters (and keys) required, straight quotation marks were invented as a compromise. (In countries that use angled quotation marks, those were not implemented on typewriters either[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_].)

Early computer keyboards copied layouts that had been established by typewriter keyboards. Most computer keyboards do not have specific keys for curved quotation marks or angled quotation marks. This may also have to do with computer character sets:

*   [IBM character sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_page#IBM_PC_/_DOS_(OEM)_code_pages "Code page") generally do not include curved quotation mark characters, therefore, keys for those marks are absent from most IBM computer keyboards.[[87]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark#cite_note-ibmkbd-109)
*   Microsoft followed the example of IBM in its character set and keyboard design. Curved quotation marks were implemented later in [Windows character sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_code_page "Windows code page"), but most Microsoft computer keyboards[[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark#cite_note-110) do not have a dedicated key for the curved quotation mark characters. On keyboards with the Alt Gr key or both the Alt key and the [numeric keypad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeric_keypad "Numeric keypad"), they are accessible through a series of keystrokes that involve these keys.[[c]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark#cite_note-112) Also, techniques using [their Unicode code points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark#Unicode_code_point_table) are available; see [Unicode input](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_input#Hexadecimal_code_input "Unicode input").
*   [Macintosh character sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_page#Apple_related_code_pages "Code page") have always had curved quotation marks available. Nevertheless, these are mostly only accessible through a series of keystrokes involving the ⌥ Opt key.

### Curved quotes within and across applications

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Quotation_mark&action=edit&section=24 "Edit section: Curved quotes within and across applications")]

Historically, support for curved quotes was a problem in information technology, primarily because the widely used ASCII character set did not include a representation for them.[[f]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark#cite_note-131)

The term "smart quotes", “...”, is from the name in several word processors of a function aimed this problem: automatically converting straight quotes typed by the user into curved quotes, the feature attempts to be "smart" enough to determine whether the punctuation marked opening or closing. Since curved quotes are the typographically correct ones,[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] word processors have traditionally offered curved quotes to users (at minimum as available characters). Before [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode "Unicode") was widely accepted and supported, this meant representing the curved quotes in whatever 8-bit encoding the software and underlying [operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system "Operating system") was using. The character sets for [Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows "Microsoft Windows") and [Macintosh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Macintosh "Apple Macintosh") used two different pairs of values for curved quotes, while [ISO 8859-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8859-1 "ISO 8859-1") (historically the default character set for the [Unixes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix "Unix") and older [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux "Linux") systems) has _no_ curved quotes, making cross-platform and cross-application compatibility difficult.

Performance by these "smart quotes" features was far from perfect overall (variance potential by e.g. subject matter, formatting/style convention, user typing habits). As many word processors (including Microsoft Word and [OpenOffice.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenOffice.org "OpenOffice.org")) have the function enabled by default, users may not have realized that the ASCII-compatible straight quotes they were typing on their keyboards ended up as something different (conversely users could incorrectly assume its functioning in other applications, e.g. composing emails).

The curved [apostrophe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe "Apostrophe") is the same character as the closing single quote.[[106]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark#cite_note-132) "Smart quotes" features wrongly convert initial apostrophes (as in 'tis, 'em, 'til, and '89) into _opening_ single quotes. (An example of this error appears in the advertisements for the television show _['Til Death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%27Til\_Death "'Til Death")_.) The two very different functions of this character can cause confusion, particularly in British styles,[[g]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark#cite_note-GB-133) in which single quotes are the standard primary.

Unicode support has since become the norm for operating systems. Thus, in at least some cases, transferring content containing curved quotes (or any other non-ASCII characters) from a word processor to another application or platform has been less troublesome, provided all steps in the process (including the [clipboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipboard_(software) "Clipboard (software)") if applicable) are Unicode-aware. But there are still applications which still use the older character sets, or output data using them, and thus problems still occur.

There are other considerations for including curved quotes in the widely used [markup languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language "Markup language") HTML, [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML "XML"), and [SGML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SGML "SGML"). If the encoding of the document supports direct representation of the characters, they can be used, but doing so can cause difficulties if the document needs to be edited by someone who is using an editor that cannot support the encoding. For example, many simple text editors only handle a few encodings or assume that the encoding of any file opened is a platform default, so the quote characters may appear as the generic replacement character � or "[mojibake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojibake "Mojibake")" (gibberish). HTML includes a set of entities for curved quotes: `&lsquo;` (left single), `&rsquo;` (right single or apostrophe), `&sbquo;` (low 9 single), `&ldquo;` (left double), `&rdquo;` (right double), and `&bdquo;` (low 9 double). XML does not define these by default, but specifications based on it can do so, and XHTML does. In addition, while the HTML 4, XHTML and XML specifications allow specifying numeric character references in either hexadecimal or decimal, SGML and older versions of HTML (and many old implementations) only support decimal references. Thus, to represent curly quotes in XML and SGML, it is safest to use the decimal numeric character references. That is, to represent the double curly quotes use `&#8220;` and `&#8221;`, and to represent single curly quotes use `&#8216;` and `&#8217;`. Both numeric and named references function correctly in almost every modern browser. While using numeric references can make a page more compatible with outdated browsers, using named references are safer for systems that handle multiple character encodings (i.e. RSS aggregators and search results).

In [Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows "Windows") file and folder names, the straight double quotation mark is prohibited, as it is a [reserved character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserved_character "Reserved character"). The curved quotation marks, as well as the straight single quotation mark, are permitted.

The style of quoting known as [Usenet quoting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet_quoting "Usenet quoting") uses the [greater-than sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater-than_sign "Greater-than sign"), > prepended to a line of text to mark it as a quote. This convention was later standardized in [RFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFC_(identifier) "RFC (identifier)")[3676](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3676), and was adopted subsequently by many email clients when automatically including quoted text from previous messages (in [plain text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_text "Plain text") mode).

### Unicode code point table

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Quotation_mark&action=edit&section=26 "Edit section: Unicode code point table")]

In Unicode, 30 characters are marked `Quotation Mark=Yes` by [character property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_character_property "Unicode character property").[[107]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark#cite_note-134) They all have general category "Punctuation", and a subcategory Open, Close, Initial, Final or Other (`Ps, Pe, Pi, Pf, Po`). Several other Unicode characters with quotation mark semantics lack the character property.
