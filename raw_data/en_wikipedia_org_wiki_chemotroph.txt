[ 1 ] These molecules can be organic ( chemoorganotrophs ) or inorganic ( chemolithotrophs ). The chemotroph designation is in contrast to phototrophs , which use photons. Chemotrophs can be either autotrophic or heterotrophic . Chemotrophs can be found in areas where electron donors are present in high concentration, for instance around hydrothermal vents .

[ citation needed ] Chemoautotroph [ edit ] A black smoker vent in the Atlantic Ocean , providing energy and nutrients for chemotrophs Chemoautotrophs are autotrophic organisms that can rely on chemosynthesis , i.e. deriving biological energy from chemical reactions of environmental inorganic substrates and synthesizing all necessary organic compounds from carbon dioxide . Chemoautotrophs can use inorganic energy sources such as hydrogen sulfide , elemental sulfur , ferrous iron , molecular hydrogen , and ammonia or organic sources to produce energy. Most chemoautotrophs are prokaryotic extremophiles , bacteria , or archaea that live in otherwise hostile environments (such as deep sea vents ) and are the primary producers in such ecosystems . Chemoautotrophs generally fall into several groups: methanogens , sulfur oxidizers and reducers , nitrifiers , anammox bacteria, and thermoacidophiles . An example of one of these prokaryotes would be Sulfolobus . Chemolithotrophic growth can be very fast, such as Hydrogenovibrio crunogenus with a doubling time around one hour.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] The term "chemosynthesis", coined in 1897 by Wilhelm Pfeffer , originally was defined as the energy production by oxidation of inorganic substances in association with autotrophy — what would be named today as chemolithoautotrophy . Later, the term would include also the chemoorganoautotrophy , that is, it can be seen as a synonym of chemoautotrophy.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] Chemoheterotroph [ edit ] Chemoheterotrophs (or chemotrophic heterotrophs) are unable to fix carbon to form their own organic compounds. Chemoheterotrophs can be chemolithoheterotrophs , utilizing inorganic electron sources such as sulfur, or, much more commonly, chemoorganoheterotrophs , utilizing organic electron sources such as carbohydrates , lipids , and proteins .

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] Most animals and fungi are examples of chemoheterotrophs, as are halophiles .

[ citation needed ] Iron- and manganese-oxidizing bacteria [ edit ] See also: Iron-oxidizing bacteria Iron-oxidizing bacteria are chemotrophic bacteria that derive energy by oxidizing dissolved ferrous iron . They are known to grow and proliferate in waters containing iron concentrations as low as 0.1 mg/L. However, at least 0.3 ppm of dissolved oxygen is needed to carry out the oxidation.

[ 10 ] Iron has many existing roles in biology not related to redox reactions; examples include iron–sulfur proteins , hemoglobin , and coordination complexes . Iron has a widespread distribution globally and is considered one of the most abundant in the Earth's crust, soil, and sediments.

[ 11 ] Iron is a trace element in marine environments .

[ 11 ] Its role as the electron donor for some chemolithotrophs is probably very ancient.
