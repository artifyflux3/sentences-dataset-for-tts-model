The classification of real simple Lie algebras is one of the major achievements of Wilhelm Killing and Élie Cartan .

A direct sum of simple Lie algebras is called a semisimple Lie algebra .

A simple Lie group is a connected Lie group whose Lie algebra is simple.

Complex simple Lie algebras [ edit ] Main article: root system A finite-dimensional simple complex Lie algebra is isomorphic to either of the following: s l n C {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {sl}}_{n}\mathbb {C} } , s o n C {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {so}}_{n}\mathbb {C} } , s p 2 n C {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {sp}}_{2n}\mathbb {C} } ( classical Lie algebras ) or one of the five exceptional Lie algebras .

[ 1 ] To each finite-dimensional complex semisimple Lie algebra g {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {g}}} , there exists a corresponding diagram (called the Dynkin diagram ) where the nodes denote the simple roots, the nodes are jointed (or not jointed) by a number of lines depending on the angles between the simple roots and the arrows are put to indicate whether the roots are longer or shorter.

[ 2 ] The Dynkin diagram of g {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {g}}} is connected if and only if g {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {g}}} is simple. All possible connected Dynkin diagrams are the following: [ 3 ] where n is the number of the nodes (the simple roots). The correspondence of the diagrams and complex simple Lie algebras is as follows: [ 2 ] (A n ) s l n + 1 C {\displaystyle \quad {\mathfrak {sl}}_{n+1}\mathbb {C} } (B n ) s o 2 n + 1 C {\displaystyle \quad {\mathfrak {so}}_{2n+1}\mathbb {C} } (C n ) s p 2 n C {\displaystyle \quad {\mathfrak {sp}}_{2n}\mathbb {C} } (D n ) s o 2 n C {\displaystyle \quad {\mathfrak {so}}_{2n}\mathbb {C} } The rest, exceptional Lie algebras .

Real simple Lie algebras [ edit ] If g 0 {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {g}}_{0}} is a finite-dimensional real simple Lie algebra, its complexification is either (1) simple or (2) a product of a simple complex Lie algebra and its conjugate . For example, the complexification of s l n C {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {sl}}_{n}\mathbb {C} } thought of as a real Lie algebra is s l n C × × s l n C ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {sl}}_{n}\mathbb {C} \times {\overline {{\mathfrak {sl}}_{n}\mathbb {C} }}} . Thus, a real simple Lie algebra can be classified by the classification of complex simple Lie algebras and some additional information. This can be done by Satake diagrams that generalize Dynkin diagrams . See also Table of Lie groups#Real Lie algebras for a partial list of real simple Lie algebras.
