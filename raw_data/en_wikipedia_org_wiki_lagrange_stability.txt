For any point in the state space, x ∈ ∈ M {\displaystyle x\in M} in a real continuous dynamical system ( T , M , Φ Φ ) {\displaystyle (T,M,\Phi )} , where T {\displaystyle T} is R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } , the motion Φ Φ ( t , x ) {\displaystyle \Phi (t,x)} is said to be positively Lagrange stable if the positive semi-orbit γ γ x + {\displaystyle \gamma _{x}^{+}} is compact . If the negative semi-orbit γ γ x − − {\displaystyle \gamma _{x}^{-}} is compact , then the motion is said to be negatively Lagrange stable . The motion through x {\displaystyle x} is said to be Lagrange stable if it is both positively and negatively Lagrange stable. If the state space M {\displaystyle M} is the Euclidean space R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} , then the above definitions are equivalent to γ γ x + , γ γ x − − {\displaystyle \gamma _{x}^{+},\gamma _{x}^{-}} and γ γ x {\displaystyle \gamma _{x}} being bounded , respectively.

A dynamical system is said to be positively-/negatively-/Lagrange stable if for each x ∈ ∈ M {\displaystyle x\in M} , the motion Φ Φ ( t , x ) {\displaystyle \Phi (t,x)} is positively-/negatively-/Lagrange stable, respectively.
