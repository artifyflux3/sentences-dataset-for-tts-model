He is known principally from a Life of Philonides , which was discovered among the charred papyrus scrolls at the Villa of the Papyri at Herculaneum .

[ 1 ] Philonides was born into a family with good connections with the Seleucid court.

[ 2 ] He is said to have been taught by Eudemus and Dionysodorus the mathematician.

[ 3 ] Philonides attempted to convert Antiochus IV Epiphanes to Epicureanism , and later instructed his nephew, Demetrius I Soter, in philosophy.

[ 2 ] Philonides was highly honoured in the court, and he is also known from various stone inscriptions.

[ 4 ] He was renowned as a mathematician, and is mentioned by Apollonius of Perga in the preface to the second book of his Conics .

[ 3 ] [ 5 ] Philonides was a zealous collector of the works of Epicurus and his colleagues, and is said to have published over 100 treatises, probably compilations of the works he collected.
