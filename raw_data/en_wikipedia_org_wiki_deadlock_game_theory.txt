For the video game, see Deadlock (video game) .

In game theory , Deadlock is a game where the action that is mutually most beneficial is also dominant . This provides a contrast to the Prisoner's Dilemma where the mutually most beneficial action is dominated.  This makes Deadlock of rather less interest, since there is no conflict between self-interest and mutual benefit.
On the other hand, deadlock game can also impact the economic behaviour and changes to equilibrium outcome in society.

General definition [ edit ] C D c a, b c, d d e, f g, h Any game that satisfies the following two conditions constitutes a Deadlock game: (1) e>g>a>c  and (2) d>h>b>f.  These conditions require that d and D be dominant.  ( d , D ) be of mutual benefit, and that one prefer one's opponent play c rather than d .

Like the Prisoner's Dilemma , this game has one unique Nash equilibrium : ( d , D ).

Example [ edit ] C D c 1, 1 0, 3 d 3, 0 2, 2 In this deadlock game, if Player C and Player D cooperate, they will get a payoff of 1 for both of them. If they both defect, they will get a payoff of 2 for each. However, if Player C cooperates and Player D defects, then C gets a payoff of 0 and D gets a payoff of 3.

Deadlock and social cooperation [ edit ] Even though deadlock game can satisfy group and individual benefit at mean time, but it can be influenced by dynamic one-side-offer bargaining deadlock model.

[ 1 ] As a result, deadlock negotiation may happen for buyers. To deal with deadlock negotiation, three types of strategies are founded to break through deadlock and buyer's negotiation. Firstly, using power move to put a price on the status quo to create a win-win situation. Secondly, process move is used for overpowering the deadlock negotiation. Lastly, appreciative moves can help buyer to satisfy their own perspectives and lead to successful cooperation.
