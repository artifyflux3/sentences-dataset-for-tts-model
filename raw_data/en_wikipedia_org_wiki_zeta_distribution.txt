If X is a zeta-distributed random variable with parameter s , then the probability that X takes the positive integer value k is given by the probability mass function f s ( k ) = k − − s ζ ζ ( s ) {\displaystyle f_{s}(k)={\frac {k^{-s}}{\zeta (s)}}} where ζ ( s ) is the Riemann zeta function (which is undefined for s = 1).

The multiplicities of distinct prime factors of X are independent random variables .

The Riemann zeta function being the sum of all terms k − − s {\displaystyle k^{-s}} for positive integer k , it appears thus as the normalization of the Zipf distribution . The terms "Zipf distribution" and "zeta distribution" are often used interchangeably. But while the Zeta distribution is a probability distribution by itself, it is not associated with Zipf's law with the same exponent.

Definition [ edit ] The Zeta distribution is defined for positive integers k ≥ ≥ 1 {\displaystyle k\geq 1} , and its probability mass function is given by P ( x = k ) = 1 ζ ζ ( s ) k − − s , {\displaystyle P(x=k)={\frac {1}{\zeta (s)}}k^{-s},} where s > 1 {\displaystyle s>1} is the parameter, and ζ ζ ( s ) {\displaystyle \zeta (s)} is the Riemann zeta function .

The cumulative distribution function is given by P ( x ≤ ≤ k ) = H k , s ζ ζ ( s ) , {\displaystyle P(x\leq k)={\frac {H_{k,s}}{\zeta (s)}},} where H k , s {\displaystyle H_{k,s}} is the generalized harmonic number H k , s = ∑ ∑ i = 1 k 1 i s .

{\displaystyle H_{k,s}=\sum _{i=1}^{k}{\frac {1}{i^{s}}}.} Moments [ edit ] The n th raw moment is defined as the expected value of X n : m n = E ( X n ) = 1 ζ ζ ( s ) ∑ ∑ k = 1 ∞ ∞ 1 k s − − n {\displaystyle m_{n}=E(X^{n})={\frac {1}{\zeta (s)}}\sum _{k=1}^{\infty }{\frac {1}{k^{s-n}}}} The series on the right is just a series representation of the Riemann zeta function, but it only converges for values of s − − n {\displaystyle s-n} that are greater than unity. Thus: m n = { ζ ζ ( s − − n ) / ζ ζ ( s ) for n < s − − 1 ∞ ∞ for n ≥ ≥ s − − 1 {\displaystyle m_{n}={\begin{cases}\zeta (s-n)/\zeta (s)&{\text{for }}n<s-1\\\infty &{\text{for }}n\geq s-1\end{cases}}} The ratio of the zeta functions is well-defined, even for n > s − 1 because the series representation of the zeta function can be analytically continued . This does not change the fact that the moments are specified by the series itself, and are therefore undefined for large n .

Moment generating function [ edit ] The moment generating function is defined as M ( t ; s ) = E ( e t X ) = 1 ζ ζ ( s ) ∑ ∑ k = 1 ∞ ∞ e t k k s .

{\displaystyle M(t;s)=E(e^{tX})={\frac {1}{\zeta (s)}}\sum _{k=1}^{\infty }{\frac {e^{tk}}{k^{s}}}.} The series is just the definition of the polylogarithm , valid for e t < 1 {\displaystyle e^{t}<1} so that M ( t ; s ) = Li s ⁡ ⁡ ( e t ) ζ ζ ( s ) for t < 0.

{\displaystyle M(t;s)={\frac {\operatorname {Li} _{s}(e^{t})}{\zeta (s)}}{\text{ for }}t<0.} Since this does not converge on an open interval containing t = 0 {\displaystyle t=0} , the moment generating function does not exist.

The case s = 1 [ edit ] ζ (1) is infinite as the harmonic series , and so the case when s = 1 is not meaningful.  However, if A is any set of positive integers that has a density, i.e. if lim n → → ∞ ∞ N ( A , n ) n {\displaystyle \lim _{n\to \infty }{\frac {N(A,n)}{n}}} exists where N ( A , n ) is the number of members of A less than or equal to n , then lim s → → 1 + P ( X ∈ ∈ A ) {\displaystyle \lim _{s\to 1^{+}}P(X\in A)\,} is equal to that density.

The latter limit can also exist in some cases in which A does not have a density.  For example, if A is the set of all positive integers whose first digit is d , then A has no density, but nonetheless, the second limit given above exists and is proportional to log ⁡ ⁡ ( d + 1 ) − − log ⁡ ⁡ ( d ) = log ⁡ ⁡ ( 1 + 1 d ) , {\displaystyle \log(d+1)-\log(d)=\log \left(1+{\frac {1}{d}}\right),\,} which is Benford's law .

Infinite divisibility [ edit ] The Zeta distribution can be constructed with a sequence of independent random variables with a geometric distribution . Let p {\displaystyle p} be a prime number and X ( p − − s ) {\displaystyle X(p^{-s})} be a random variable with a geometric distribution of parameter p − − s {\displaystyle p^{-s}} , namely P ( X ( p − − s ) = k ) = p − − k s ( 1 − − p − − s ) {\displaystyle \mathbb {P} \left(X(p^{-s})=k\right)=p^{-ks}(1-p^{-s})} If the random variables ( X ( p − − s ) ) p ∈ ∈ P {\displaystyle (X(p^{-s}))_{p\in {\mathcal {P}}}} are independent, then, the random variable Z s {\displaystyle Z_{s}} defined by Z s = ∏ ∏ p ∈ ∈ P p X ( p − − s ) {\displaystyle Z_{s}=\prod _{p\in {\mathcal {P}}}p^{X(p^{-s})}} has the zeta distribution: P ( Z s = n ) = 1 n s ζ ζ ( s ) {\displaystyle \mathbb {P} \left(Z_{s}=n\right)={\frac {1}{n^{s}\zeta (s)}}} .

Stated differently, the random variable log ⁡ ⁡ ( Z s ) = ∑ ∑ p ∈ ∈ P X ( p − − s ) log ⁡ ⁡ ( p ) {\displaystyle \log(Z_{s})=\sum _{p\in {\mathcal {P}}}X(p^{-s})\,\log(p)} is infinitely divisible with Lévy measure given by the following sum of Dirac masses : Π Π s ( d x ) = ∑ ∑ p ∈ ∈ P ∑ ∑ k ⩾ ⩾ 1 p − − k s k δ δ k log ⁡ ⁡ ( p ) ( d x ) {\displaystyle \Pi _{s}(dx)=\sum _{p\in {\mathcal {P}}}\sum _{k\geqslant 1}{\frac {p^{-ks}}{k}}\delta _{k\log(p)}(dx)} See also [ edit ] Other "power-law" distributions Cauchy distribution Lévy distribution Lévy skew alpha-stable distribution Pareto distribution Zipf's law Zipf–Mandelbrot law Infinitely divisible distribution Yule–Simon distribution External links [ edit ] Gut, Allan.

What Gut calls the "Riemann zeta distribution" is actually the probability distribution of −log X , where X is a random variable with what this article calls the zeta distribution.
