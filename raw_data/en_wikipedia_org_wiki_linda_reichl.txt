[ 3 ] Education [ edit ] Reichl completed her Ph.D. in 1969 at the University of Denver with the dissertation Microscopic Theory of Quasiparticle Spin Fluctations in a Fermi Liquid .

[ 4 ] She was advised by Elizabeth R. Tuttle and Ilya Prigogine .

[ 5 ] Books [ edit ] Reichl's books include: A Modern Course in Statistical Physics (University of Texas Press, 1980; 4th ed., Wiley, 2016) [ 6 ] The Transition to Chaos: Conservative Systems and Quantum Manifestations (Springer, 1992; 2nd ed., 2004) [ 7 ] She is also the co-editor of several volumes of collected papers.

Recognition [ edit ] Reichl became a Fellow of the American Physical Society in 2000 "for her original contributions to the field of quantum chaos".
