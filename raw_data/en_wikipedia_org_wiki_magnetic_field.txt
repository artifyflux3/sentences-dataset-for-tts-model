The shape of the magnetic fields of a permanent magnet and an electromagnet are revealed by the orientation of iron filings sprinkled on pieces of paper

A **magnetic field** (sometimes called **B-field**[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-1)) is a [physical field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_field "Physical field") that describes the magnetic influence on moving [electric charges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge "Electric charge"), [electric currents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_currents "Electric currents"),[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-feynman-2): ch1 [[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-3) and magnetic materials. A moving charge in a magnetic field experiences a force perpendicular to its own velocity and to the magnetic field.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-feynman-2): ch13 [[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-Purcell3ed-4): 278  A [permanent magnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_magnet "Permanent magnet")'s magnetic field pulls on [ferromagnetic materials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferromagnetic_material "Ferromagnetic material") such as [iron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron "Iron"), and attracts or repels other magnets. In addition, a nonuniform magnetic field exerts minuscule forces on "nonmagnetic" materials by three other magnetic effects: [paramagnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramagnetism "Paramagnetism"), [diamagnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamagnetism "Diamagnetism"), and [antiferromagnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiferromagnetism "Antiferromagnetism"), although these forces are usually so small they can only be detected by laboratory equipment. Magnetic fields surround magnetized materials, electric currents, and [electric fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_field "Electric field") varying in time. Since both strength and direction of a magnetic field may vary with location, it is described mathematically by a [function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics) "Function (mathematics)") assigning a [vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector "Euclidean vector") to each point of space, called a [vector field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_field "Vector field") (more precisely, a [pseudovector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudovector "Pseudovector") field).

In [electromagnetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetics "Electromagnetics"), the term _magnetic field_ is used for two distinct but closely related vector fields denoted by the symbols **B** and **H**. In the [International System of Units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units "International System of Units"), the unit of **B**, [magnetic flux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_flux "Magnetic flux") density, is the [tesla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_(unit) "Tesla (unit)") (in SI base units: kilogram per second squared per ampere),[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-:1-5): 21  which is equivalent to [newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_(unit) "Newton (unit)") per meter per ampere. The unit of **H**, magnetic field strength, is [ampere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampere "Ampere") per meter (A/m).[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-:1-5): 22 **B** and **H** differ in how they take the medium and/or magnetization into account. In [vacuum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum "Vacuum"), the two fields are related through the [vacuum permeability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_permeability "Vacuum permeability"), ![Image 3: {\displaystyle \mathbf {B} /\mu _{0}=\mathbf {H} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/773a5eb3020e0a6c574f625c487a7e3d8eaec1bf); in a magnetized material, the quantities on each side of this equation differ by the [magnetization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetization "Magnetization") field of the material.

Magnetic fields are produced by moving electric charges and the intrinsic [magnetic moments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_moment "Magnetic moment") of [elementary particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_particle "Elementary particle") associated with a fundamental quantum property, their [spin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_(physics) "Spin (physics)").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-Jiles-6)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-feynman-2): ch1  Magnetic fields and [electric fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_field "Electric field") are interrelated and are both components of the [electromagnetic force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_force "Electromagnetic force"), one of the four [fundamental forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_force "Fundamental force") of nature.

Magnetic fields are used throughout modern technology, particularly in [electrical engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_engineering "Electrical engineering") and [electromechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromechanics "Electromechanics"). Rotating magnetic fields are used in both [electric motors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_motor "Electric motor") and [generators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_generator "Electric generator"). The interaction of magnetic fields in electric devices such as transformers is conceptualized and investigated as [magnetic circuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_circuit "Magnetic circuit"). Magnetic forces give information about the charge carriers in a material through the [Hall effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall_effect "Hall effect"). The Earth produces [its own magnetic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_magnetic_field "Earth's magnetic field"), which shields the Earth's ozone layer from the [solar wind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_wind "Solar wind") and is important in [navigation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation "Navigation") using a [compass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compass "Compass").

Description
-----------

The force on an electric charge depends on its location, speed, and direction; two vector fields are used to describe this force.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-feynman-2): ch1  The first is the [electric field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_field "Electric field"), which describes the force acting on a stationary charge and gives the component of the force that is independent of motion. The magnetic field, in contrast, describes the component of the force that is proportional to both the speed and direction of charged particles.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-feynman-2): ch13  The field is defined by the [Lorentz force law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_force_law "Lorentz force law") and is, at each instant, perpendicular to both the motion of the charge and the force it experiences.

There are two different, but closely related vector fields which are both sometimes called the "magnetic field" written **B** and **H**.[[note 1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-7) While both the best names for these fields and exact interpretation of what these fields represent has been the subject of long running debate, there is wide agreement about how the underlying physics work.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-8) Historically, the term "magnetic field" was reserved for **H** while using other terms for **B**, but many recent textbooks use the term "magnetic field" to describe **B** as well as or in place of **H**.[[note 2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-ex03-9) There are many alternative names for both (see sidebars).

### The B-field

[![Image 4](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/FuerzaCentripetaLorentzP.svg/250px-FuerzaCentripetaLorentzP.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:FuerzaCentripetaLorentzP.svg)

A charged particle that is moving with velocity **v** in a magnetic field **B** will feel a magnetic force **F**. Since the magnetic force always pulls sideways to the direction of motion, the particle moves in a circle.

| Alternative names for **B**[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-Electromagnetics-10) |
| --- |
| * Magnetic flux density[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-:1-5): 138 * Magnetic induction[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-Stratton-11) * Magnetic field (ambiguous) |

The magnetic field vector **B** at any point can be defined as the vector that, when used in the [Lorentz force law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_force_law "Lorentz force law"), correctly predicts the force on a charged particle at that point:[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-purcell2ed-12)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-Griffiths3ed-13): 204

Here **F** is the force on the particle, _q_ is the particle's [electric charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge "Electric charge"), **E** is the external electric field, **v**, is the particle's [velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity "Velocity"), and × denotes the [cross product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_product "Cross product"). The direction of force on the charge can be determined by a [mnemonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic "Mnemonic") known as the _right-hand rule_ (see the figure).[[note 3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-14) Using the right hand, pointing the thumb in the direction of the current, and the fingers in the direction of the magnetic field, the resulting force on the charge points outwards from the palm. The force on a negatively charged particle is in the opposite direction. If both the speed and the charge are reversed then the direction of the force remains the same. For that reason a magnetic field measurement (by itself) cannot distinguish whether there is a positive charge moving to the right or a negative charge moving to the left. (Both of these cases produce the same current.) On the other hand, a magnetic field combined with an electric field _can_ distinguish between these, see [Hall effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#Hall_effect) below.

The first term in the Lorentz equation is from the theory of [electrostatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrostatics "Electrostatics"), and says that a particle of charge _q_ in an electric field **E** experiences an electric force: ![Image 5: {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} _{\text{electric}}=q\mathbf {E} .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d694aac8114153241a5251d7a3cb0279ad6a4b79)

The second term is the magnetic force:[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-Griffiths3ed-13)![Image 6: {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} _{\text{magnetic}}=q(\mathbf {v} \times \mathbf {B} ).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b2865c0088b4b03798aef68322fbbd19307762a7)

Using the definition of the cross product, the magnetic force can also be written as a [scalar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_(physics) "Scalar (physics)") equation:[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-purcell2ed-12): 357 ![Image 7: {\displaystyle F_{\text{magnetic}}=qvB\sin(\theta )}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2b7c35be48f0f9efbcff642408d09df2c9e0ad58) where _F_ magnetic, v, and B are the [scalar magnitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(mathematics) "Norm (mathematics)") of their respective vectors, and θ is the angle between the velocity of the particle and the magnetic field. The vector **B** is _defined_ as the vector field necessary to make the Lorentz force law correctly describe the motion of a charged particle. In other words,[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-purcell2ed-12): [173](https://archive.org/details/electricitymagne00purc_621/page/n192)–4

> [T]he command, "Measure the direction and magnitude of the vector **B** at such and such a place," calls for the following operations: Take a particle of known charge _q_. Measure the force on _q_ at rest, to determine **E**. Then measure the force on the particle when its velocity is **v**; repeat with **v** in some other direction. Now find a **B** that makes the Lorentz force law fit all these results—that is the magnetic field at the place in question.

The **B** field can also be defined by the torque on a magnetic dipole, **m**.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-jackson3ed-15): 174

The [SI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI "SI") unit of **B** is [tesla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_(unit) "Tesla (unit)") (symbol: T).[[note 4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-16) The [Gaussian-cgs unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_units "Gaussian units") of **B** is the [gauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss_(unit) "Gauss (unit)") (symbol: G). (The conversion is 1 T ≘ 10000 G.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-BIPMTab9-17)[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-KLang-18)) One nanotesla corresponds to 1 gamma (symbol: γ).[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-KLang-18)

### The H-field

| Alternative names for **H**[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-Electromagnetics-10) |

The magnetic **H** field is defined:[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-Griffiths3ed-13): 269 [[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-jackson3ed-15): 192 [[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-feynman-2): ch36

where ![Image 8: {\displaystyle \mu _{0}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fe2fd9b8decb38a3cd158e7b6c0c6e2d987fefcc) is the [vacuum permeability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_permeability "Vacuum permeability"), and **M** is the [magnetization vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetization "Magnetization"). In a vacuum, **B** and **H** are proportional to each other. Inside a material they are different (see [H and B inside and outside magnetic materials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#H-field_and_magnetic_materials)). The SI unit of the **H**-field is the [ampere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampere "Ampere") per metre (A/m),[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-19) and the CGS unit is the [oersted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oersted "Oersted") (Oe).[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-BIPMTab9-17)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-purcell2ed-12): 286

### Measurement

An instrument used to measure the local magnetic field is known as a [magnetometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetometer "Magnetometer"). Important classes of magnetometers include using [induction magnetometers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_coil "Search coil") (or search-coil magnetometers) which measure only varying magnetic fields, [rotating coil magnetometers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetometer#Rotating_coil_magnetometer "Magnetometer"), [Hall effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall_effect "Hall effect") magnetometers, [NMR magnetometers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_magnetometer "Proton magnetometer"), [SQUID magnetometers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQUID "SQUID"), and [fluxgate magnetometers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetometer#Fluxgate_magnetometer "Magnetometer"). The magnetic fields of distant [astronomical objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_object "Astronomical object") are measured through their effects on local charged particles. For instance, electrons spiraling around a field line produce [synchrotron radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchrotron_radiation "Synchrotron radiation") that is detectable in [radio waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_waves "Radio waves"). The finest precision for a magnetic field measurement was attained by [Gravity Probe B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_Probe_B "Gravity Probe B") at 5 aT (5×10−18 T).[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-20)

### Visualization

[![Image 9](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/Magnet0873.png/250px-Magnet0873.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Magnet0873.png)

[![Image 10](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d1/Magnetic_field_near_pole.svg/120px-Magnetic_field_near_pole.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Magnetic_field_near_pole.svg)

Left: the direction of magnetic [field lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_line "Field line") represented by [iron filings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_filings "Iron filings") sprinkled on paper placed above a bar magnet.

 Right: [compass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compass "Compass") needles point in the direction of the local magnetic field, towards a magnet's south pole and away from its north pole.

The field can be visualized by a set of _magnetic field lines_, that follow the direction of the field at each point. The lines can be constructed by measuring the strength and direction of the magnetic field at a large number of points (or at every point in space). Then, mark each location with an arrow (called a [vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(geometry) "Vector (geometry)")) pointing in the direction of the local magnetic field with its magnitude proportional to the strength of the magnetic field. Connecting these arrows then forms a set of magnetic field lines. The direction of the magnetic field at any point is parallel to the direction of nearby field lines, and the local density of field lines can be made proportional to its strength. Magnetic field lines are like [streamlines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streamlines,_streaklines,_and_pathlines "Streamlines, streaklines, and pathlines") in [fluid flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_dynamics "Fluid dynamics"), in that they represent a continuous distribution, and a different resolution would show more or fewer lines.

An advantage of using magnetic field lines as a representation is that many laws of magnetism (and electromagnetism) can be stated completely and concisely using simple concepts such as the "number" of field lines through a surface. These concepts can be quickly "translated" to their mathematical form. For example, the number of field lines through a given surface is the [surface integral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_integral "Surface integral") of the magnetic field.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-purcell2ed-12): 237

Various phenomena "display" magnetic field lines as though the field lines were physical phenomena. For example, iron filings placed in a magnetic field form lines that correspond to "field lines".[[note 5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-ex07-21) Magnetic field "lines" are also visually displayed in [polar auroras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora_(astronomy) "Aurora (astronomy)"), in which [plasma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics) "Plasma (physics)") particle dipole interactions create visible streaks of light that line up with the local direction of Earth's magnetic field.

Field lines can be used as a qualitative tool to visualize magnetic forces. In [ferromagnetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferromagnetic "Ferromagnetic") substances like [iron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron "Iron") and in plasmas, magnetic forces can be understood by imagining that the field lines exert a [tension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell_stress_tensor "Maxwell stress tensor"), (like a rubber band) along their length, and a pressure perpendicular to their length on neighboring field lines. "Unlike" poles of magnets attract because they are linked by many field lines; "like" poles repel because their field lines do not meet, but run parallel, pushing on each other.

Magnetic field of permanent magnets
-----------------------------------

_Permanent magnets_ are objects that produce their own persistent magnetic fields. They are made of [ferromagnetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferromagnetism "Ferromagnetism") materials, such as iron and [nickel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel "Nickel"), that have been magnetized, and they have both a north and a south pole.

The magnetic field of permanent magnets can be quite complicated, especially near the magnet. The magnetic field of a small[[note 6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-ex05-22) straight magnet is proportional to the magnet's _strength_ (called its [magnetic dipole moment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_dipole_moment "Magnetic dipole moment")**m**). The [equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipole#Field_of_a_static_magnetic_dipole "Dipole") are non-trivial and depend on the distance from the magnet and the orientation of the magnet. For simple magnets, **m** points in the direction of a line drawn from the south to the north pole of the magnet. Flipping a bar magnet is equivalent to rotating its **m** by 180 degrees.

The magnetic field of larger magnets can be obtained by modeling them as a collection of a large number of small magnets called [dipoles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipole "Dipole") each having their own **m**. The magnetic field produced by the magnet then is the net magnetic field of these dipoles; any net force on the magnet is a result of adding up the forces on the individual dipoles.

There are two simplified models for the nature of these dipoles: the [magnetic pole model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#Magnetic_pole_model) and the [Amperian loop model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#Amperian_loop_model). These two models produce two different magnetic fields, **H** and **B**. Outside a material, though, the two are identical (to a multiplicative constant) so that in many cases the distinction can be ignored. This is particularly true for magnetic fields, such as those due to electric currents, that are not generated by magnetic materials.

A realistic model of magnetism is more complicated than either of these models; neither model fully explains why materials are magnetic. The monopole model has no experimental support. The Amperian loop model explains some, but not all of a material's magnetic moment. The model predicts that the motion of electrons within an atom are connected to those electrons' [orbital magnetic dipole moment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_magnetic_moment#Orbital_magnetic_dipole_moment "Electron magnetic moment"), and these orbital moments do contribute to the magnetism seen at the macroscopic level. However, the motion of electrons is not classical, and the [spin magnetic moment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_magnetic_moment "Spin magnetic moment") of electrons (which is not explained by either model) is also a significant contribution to the total moment of magnets.

### Magnetic pole model

[![Image 11](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/VFPt_dipole_electric.svg/250px-VFPt_dipole_electric.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:VFPt_dipole_electric.svg)

The magnetic pole model: two opposing poles, North (+) and South (−), separated by a distance d produce a **H**-field (lines).

Historically, early physics textbooks would model the force and torques between two magnets as due to magnetic poles repelling or attracting each other in the same manner as the [Coulomb force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coulomb_force "Coulomb force") between electric charges. At the microscopic level, this model contradicts the experimental evidence, and the pole model of magnetism is no longer the typical way to introduce the concept.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-Griffiths3ed-13): 258  However, it is still sometimes used as a macroscopic model for ferromagnetism due to its mathematical simplicity.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-23)

In this model, a magnetic **H**-field is produced by fictitious _magnetic charges_ that are spread over the surface of each pole. These _magnetic charges_ are in fact related to the magnetization field **M**. The **H**-field, therefore, is analogous to the [electric field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_field "Electric field")**E**, which starts at a positive [electric charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge "Electric charge") and ends at a negative electric charge. Near the north pole, therefore, all **H**-field lines point away from the north pole (whether inside the magnet or out) while near the south pole all **H**-field lines point toward the south pole (whether inside the magnet or out). Too, a north pole feels a force in the direction of the **H**-field while the force on the south pole is opposite to the **H**-field.

In the magnetic pole model, the elementary magnetic dipole **m** is formed by two opposite magnetic poles of pole strength _q_ m separated by a small distance vector **d**, such that **m** = _q_ m**d**. The magnetic pole model predicts correctly the field **H** both inside and outside magnetic materials, in particular the fact that **H** is opposite to the magnetization field **M** inside a permanent magnet.

Since it is based on the fictitious idea of a _magnetic charge density_, the pole model has limitations. Magnetic poles cannot exist apart from each other as electric charges can, but always come in north–south pairs. If a magnetized object is divided in half, a new pole appears on the surface of each piece, so each has a pair of complementary poles. The magnetic pole model does not account for magnetism that is produced by electric currents, nor the inherent connection between [angular momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_momentum "Angular momentum") and magnetism.

The pole model usually treats magnetic charge as a mathematical abstraction, rather than a physical property of particles. However, a [magnetic monopole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_monopole "Magnetic monopole") is a hypothetical particle (or class of particles) that physically has only one magnetic pole (either a north pole or a south pole). In other words, it would possess a "magnetic charge" analogous to an electric charge. Magnetic field lines would start or end on magnetic monopoles, so if they exist, they would give exceptions to the rule that magnetic field lines neither start nor end. Some theories (such as [Grand Unified Theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Unified_Theory "Grand Unified Theory")) have predicted the existence of magnetic monopoles, but so far, none have been observed.

### Amperian loop model

[![Image 12](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/VFPt_dipole_magnetic3.svg/250px-VFPt_dipole_magnetic3.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:VFPt_dipole_magnetic3.svg)

[![Image 13](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/VFPt_dipole_animation_magnetic.gif/152px-VFPt_dipole_animation_magnetic.gif)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:VFPt_dipole_animation_magnetic.gif)

A current loop (ring) that goes into the page at the x and comes out at the dot produces a **B**-field (lines). As the radius of the current loop shrinks, the fields produced become identical to an abstract "magnetostatic dipole" (represented by an arrow pointing to the right).

In the model developed by [Ampere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9-Marie_Amp%C3%A8re "André-Marie Ampère"), the elementary magnetic dipole that makes up all magnets is a sufficiently small Amperian loop with current _I_ and loop area _A_. The dipole moment of this loop is _m_ = _IA_.

These magnetic dipoles produce a magnetic **B**-field.

The magnetic field of a magnetic dipole is depicted in the figure. From outside, the ideal magnetic dipole is identical to that of an ideal electric dipole of the same strength. Unlike the electric dipole, a magnetic dipole is properly modeled as a current loop having a current _I_ and an area _a_. Such a current loop has a magnetic moment of ![Image 14: {\displaystyle m=Ia,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bed6ffe7528c65af396ecbdf02f278b9f2484806) where the direction of **m** is perpendicular to the area of the loop and depends on the direction of the current using the right-hand rule. An ideal magnetic dipole is modeled as a real magnetic dipole whose area _a_ has been reduced to zero and its current _I_ increased to infinity such that the product _m_ = _Ia_ is finite. This model clarifies the connection between angular momentum and magnetic moment, which is the basis of the [Einstein–de Haas effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein%E2%80%93de_Haas_effect "Einstein–de Haas effect")_rotation by magnetization_ and its inverse, the [Barnett effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnett_effect "Barnett effect") or _magnetization by rotation_.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-Graham-24) Rotating the loop faster (in the same direction) increases the current and therefore the magnetic moment, for example.

Interactions with magnets
-------------------------

### Force between magnets

Specifying the [force between two small magnets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_moment#Forces_between_two_magnetic_dipoles "Magnetic moment") is quite complicated because it depends on the strength and [orientation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientation_(geometry) "Orientation (geometry)") of both magnets and their distance and direction relative to each other. The force is particularly sensitive to rotations of the magnets due to magnetic torque. The force on each magnet depends on its magnetic moment and the magnetic field[[note 7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-ex04-25) of the other.

To understand the force between magnets, it is useful to examine the _magnetic pole model_ given above. In this model, the _**H**-field_ of one magnet pushes and pulls on _both_ poles of a second magnet. If this **H**-field is the same at both poles of the second magnet then there is no net force on that magnet since the force is opposite for opposite poles. If, however, the magnetic field of the first magnet is _nonuniform_ (such as the **H** near one of its poles), each pole of the second magnet sees a different field and is subject to a different force. This difference in the two forces moves the magnet in the direction of increasing magnetic field and may also cause a net torque.

This is a specific example of a general rule that magnets are attracted (or repulsed depending on the orientation of the magnet) into regions of higher magnetic field. Any non-uniform magnetic field, whether caused by permanent magnets or electric currents, exerts a force on a small magnet in this way.

The details of the Amperian loop model are different and more complicated but yield the same result: that magnetic dipoles are attracted/repelled into regions of higher magnetic field. Mathematically, the force on a small magnet having a magnetic moment **m** due to a magnetic field **B** is:[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-Trigg-26): Eq. 11.42

![Image 15: {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} ={\boldsymbol {\nabla }}\left(\mathbf {m} \cdot \mathbf {B} \right),}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2000ebec9a4d95147f858853f908ec09e1c0c23b)

where the [gradient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient "Gradient")**∇** is the change of the quantity **m** · **B** per unit distance and the direction is that of maximum increase of **m** · **B**. The [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product "Dot product")**m** · **B** = _mB_ cos(_θ_), where _m_ and _B_ represent the [magnitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnitude_(vector) "Magnitude (vector)") of the **m** and **B** vectors and _θ_ is the angle between them. If **m** is in the same direction as **B** then the dot product is positive and the gradient points "uphill" pulling the magnet into regions of higher **B**-field (more strictly larger **m** · **B**). This equation is strictly only valid for magnets of zero size, but is often a good approximation for not too large magnets. The magnetic force on larger magnets is determined by dividing them into smaller regions each having their own **m** then [summing up the forces on each of these very small regions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral "Integral").

### Magnetic torque on permanent magnets

If two like poles of two separate magnets are brought near each other, and one of the magnets is allowed to turn, it promptly rotates to align itself with the first. In this example, the magnetic field of the stationary magnet creates a _magnetic torque_ on the magnet that is free to rotate. This magnetic torque **τ** tends to align a magnet's poles with the magnetic field lines. A compass, therefore, turns to align itself with Earth's magnetic field.

[![Image 16](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Dipole_in_uniform_H_field.svg/250px-Dipole_in_uniform_H_field.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Dipole_in_uniform_H_field.svg)

In the pole model of a dipole, an **H** field (to right) causes equal but opposite forces on a N pole (+_q_) and a S pole (−_q_) creating a torque.

[![Image 17](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Torque-current-loop.svg/250px-Torque-current-loop.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Torque-current-loop.svg)

Equivalently, a **B** field induces the same torque on a current loop with the same magnetic dipole moment.

In terms of the pole model, two equal and opposite magnetic charges experiencing the same **H** also experience equal and opposite forces. Since these equal and opposite forces are in different locations, this produces a torque proportional to the distance (perpendicular to the force) between them. With the definition of **m** as the pole strength times the distance between the poles, this leads to _τ_ = _μ_ 0 _m H_ sin _θ_, where _μ_ 0 is a constant called the [vacuum permeability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_permeability "Vacuum permeability"), measuring 4π×10−7[V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt "Volt")·[s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second "Second")/([A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampere "Ampere")·[m](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meter "Meter")) and θ is the angle between **H** and **m**.

Mathematically, the torque **τ** on a small magnet is proportional both to the applied magnetic field and to the magnetic moment **m** of the magnet:

![Image 18: {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\tau }}=\mathbf {m} \times \mathbf {B} =\mu _{0}\mathbf {m} \times \mathbf {H} ,\,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8b2df4e74d1520e0bfd55c8f844c33c2d77c41bb)

where × represents the vector [cross product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_product "Cross product"). This equation includes all of the qualitative information included above. There is no torque on a magnet if **m** is in the same direction as the magnetic field, since the cross product is zero for two vectors that are in the same direction. Further, all other orientations feel a torque that twists them toward the direction of magnetic field.

Interactions with electric currents
-----------------------------------

Currents of electric charges both generate a magnetic field and feel a force due to magnetic B-fields.

### Magnetic field due to moving charges and electric currents

[![Image 19](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Manoderecha.svg/250px-Manoderecha.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Manoderecha.svg)

[Right hand grip rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_hand_grip_rule "Right hand grip rule"): a current flowing in the direction of the white arrow produces a magnetic field shown by the red arrows.

All moving charged particles produce magnetic fields. Moving [point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_particle "Point particle") charges, such as [electrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron "Electron"), produce complicated but well known magnetic fields that depend on the charge, velocity, and acceleration of the particles.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-27)

Magnetic field lines form in [concentric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentric "Concentric") circles around a [cylindrical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylinder_(geometry) "Cylinder (geometry)") current-carrying conductor, such as a length of wire. The direction of such a magnetic field can be determined by using the "[right-hand grip rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-hand_grip_rule "Right-hand grip rule")" (see figure at right). The strength of the magnetic field decreases with distance from the wire. (For an infinite length wire the strength is inversely proportional to the distance.)

[![Image 20](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/VFPt_cylindrical_tightly-wound_coil-and-bar-magnet-comparison_stacked.svg/250px-VFPt_cylindrical_tightly-wound_coil-and-bar-magnet-comparison_stacked.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:VFPt_cylindrical_tightly-wound_coil-and-bar-magnet-comparison_stacked.svg)

A [Solenoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solenoid "Solenoid") with electric current running through it behaves like a magnet.

Bending a current-carrying wire into a loop concentrates the magnetic field inside the loop while weakening it outside. Bending a wire into multiple closely spaced loops to form a coil or "[solenoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solenoid "Solenoid")" enhances this effect. A device so formed around an iron [core](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_core "Magnetic core") may act as an _electromagnet_, generating a strong, well-controlled magnetic field. An infinitely long cylindrical electromagnet has a uniform magnetic field inside, and no magnetic field outside. A finite length electromagnet produces a magnetic field that looks similar to that produced by a uniform permanent magnet, with its strength and polarity determined by the current flowing through the coil.

The magnetic field generated by a steady current I (a constant flow of electric charges, in which charge neither accumulates nor is depleted at any point)[[note 8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-ex12-29) is described by the _[Biot–Savart law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biot%E2%80%93Savart\_law "Biot–Savart law")_:[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-Griffiths4ed-28): 224 ![Image 21: {\displaystyle \mathbf {B} ={\frac {\mu _{0}I}{4\pi }}\int _{\mathrm {wire} }{\frac {\mathrm {d} {\boldsymbol {\ell }}\times \mathbf {\hat {r}} }{r^{2}}},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/95838c9bca9c99ce5d48fd7282eb55b4c679abfb) where the integral sums over the wire length where vector d**ℓ** is the vector [line element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_element "Line element") with direction in the same sense as the current _I_, _μ_ 0 is the [magnetic constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_constant "Magnetic constant"), _r_ is the distance between the location of d**ℓ** and the location where the magnetic field is calculated, and **r̂** is a unit vector in the direction of **r**. For example, in the case of a sufficiently long, straight wire, this becomes: ![Image 22: {\displaystyle |\mathbf {B} |={\frac {\mu _{0}}{2\pi r}}I}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2c44da9834dea33f37e49df0e5abc5a15cfcb9d3) where _r_ = |**r**|. The direction is tangent to a circle perpendicular to the wire according to the right hand rule.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-Griffiths4ed-28): 225

A slightly more general[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-30)[[note 9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-ex13-31) way of relating the current ![Image 23: {\displaystyle I}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/535ea7fc4134a31cbe2251d9d3511374bc41be9f) to the **B**-field is through [Ampère's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amp%C3%A8re%27s_circuital_law "Ampère's circuital law"): ![Image 24: {\displaystyle \oint \mathbf {B} \cdot \mathrm {d} {\boldsymbol {\ell }}=\mu _{0}I_{\mathrm {enc} },}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/eaffba3a24a5ddbffecba6df92dadec61d58048d) where the [line integral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_integral "Line integral") is over any arbitrary loop and ![Image 25: {\displaystyle I_{\text{enc}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/08c4588b9529bb549347f50049e6adac33d798d4) is the current enclosed by that loop. Ampère's law is always valid for steady currents and can be used to calculate the **B**-field for certain highly symmetric situations such as an infinite wire or an infinite solenoid.

In a modified form that accounts for time varying electric fields, Ampère's law is one of four [Maxwell's equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations "Maxwell's equations") that describe electricity and magnetism.

### Force on moving charges and current

#### Force on a charged particle

A [charged particle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charged_particle "Charged particle") moving in a **B**-field experiences a _sideways_ force that is proportional to the strength of the magnetic field, the component of the velocity that is perpendicular to the magnetic field and the charge of the particle. This force is known as the _Lorentz force_, and is given by ![Image 26: {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} =q\mathbf {E} +q\mathbf {v} \times \mathbf {B} ,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/daba70054e9cc1b66449c534969a45695657700f) where **F** is the [force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force "Force"), _q_ is the [electric charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge "Electric charge") of the particle, **v** is the instantaneous [velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity "Velocity") of the particle, and **B** is the magnetic field (in [teslas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_(unit) "Tesla (unit)")).

The Lorentz force is always perpendicular to both the velocity of the particle and the magnetic field that created it. When a charged particle moves in a static magnetic field, it traces a helical path in which the helix axis is parallel to the magnetic field, and in which the speed of the particle remains constant. Because the magnetic force is always perpendicular to the motion, the magnetic field can do no [work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_work "Mechanical work") on an isolated charge.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-32)[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-33) It can only do work indirectly, via the electric field generated by a changing magnetic field. It is often claimed that the magnetic force can do work to a non-elementary [magnetic dipole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_dipole "Magnetic dipole"), or to charged particles whose motion is constrained by other forces, but this is incorrect[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-Deissler-34) because the work in those cases is performed by the electric forces of the charges deflected by the magnetic field.

#### Force on current-carrying wire

The force on a current carrying wire is similar to that of a moving charge as expected since a current carrying wire is a collection of moving charges. A current-carrying wire feels a force in the presence of a magnetic field. The Lorentz force on a macroscopic current is often referred to as the _Laplace force_. Consider a conductor of length _ℓ_, cross section _A_, and charge _q_ due to electric current _i_. If this conductor is placed in a magnetic field of magnitude _B_ that makes an angle θ with the velocity of charges in the conductor, the force exerted on a single charge _q_ is ![Image 27: {\displaystyle F=qvB\sin \theta ,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/579e409eb2d96b820933438392094864fdc6dae2) so, for _N_ charges where ![Image 28: {\displaystyle N=n\ell A,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0cd359cf87c3e5bec6f04da11f5c849bcdbc0ba5) the force exerted on the conductor is ![Image 29: {\displaystyle f=FN=qvBn\ell A\sin \theta =Bi\ell \sin \theta ,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4dc5e41331151813e3e9c827ed97983668d98d56) where _i_ = _nqvA_.

Relation between H and B
------------------------

The formulas derived for the magnetic field above are correct when dealing with the entire current. A magnetic material placed inside a magnetic field, though, generates its own [bound current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bound_current "Bound current"), which can be a challenge to calculate. (This bound current is due to the sum of atomic sized current loops and the [spin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_(physics) "Spin (physics)") of the subatomic particles such as electrons that make up the material.) The **H**-field as defined above helps factor out this bound current; but to see how, it helps to introduce the concept of _magnetization_ first.

### Magnetization

The _magnetization_ vector field **M** represents how strongly a region of material is magnetized. It is defined as the net [magnetic dipole moment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_dipole_moment "Magnetic dipole moment") per unit volume of that region. The magnetization of a uniform magnet is therefore a material constant, equal to the magnetic moment **m** of the magnet divided by its volume. Since the SI unit of magnetic moment is A⋅m 2, the SI unit of magnetization **M** is ampere per meter, identical to that of the **H**-field.

The magnetization **M** field of a region points in the direction of the average magnetic dipole moment in that region. Magnetization field lines, therefore, begin near the magnetic south pole and ends near the magnetic north pole. (Magnetization does not exist outside the magnet.)

In the Amperian loop model, the magnetization is due to combining many tiny Amperian loops to form a resultant current called _[bound current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bound\_current "Bound current")_. This bound current, then, is the source of the magnetic **B** field due to the magnet. Given the definition of the magnetic dipole, the magnetization field follows a similar law to that of Ampere's law:[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-35)![Image 30: {\displaystyle \oint \mathbf {M} \cdot \mathrm {d} {\boldsymbol {\ell }}=I_{\mathrm {b} },}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8617b3ca2fd2f45af47797bd11b89dbaf75f14c9) where the integral is a line integral over any closed loop and _I_ b is the bound current enclosed by that closed loop.

In the magnetic pole model, magnetization begins at and ends at magnetic poles. If a given region, therefore, has a net positive "magnetic pole strength" (corresponding to a north pole) then it has more magnetization field lines entering it than leaving it. Mathematically this is equivalent to: ![Image 31: {\displaystyle \oint _{S}\mu _{0}\mathbf {M} \cdot \mathrm {d} \mathbf {A} =-q_{\mathrm {M} },}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/50803d43052cc495a33b72b65efb2c383fc40cb4) where the integral is a closed surface integral over the closed surface _S_ and _q_ M is the "magnetic charge" (in units of [magnetic flux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_flux "Magnetic flux")) enclosed by _S_. (A closed surface completely surrounds a region with no holes to let any field lines escape.) The negative sign occurs because the magnetization field moves from south to north.

### H-field and magnetic materials

[![Image 32](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/VFPt_magnets_BHM.svg/250px-VFPt_magnets_BHM.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:VFPt_magnets_BHM.svg)

Comparison of **B**, **H** and **M** inside and outside a cylindrical bar magnet.

In SI units, the H-field is related to the B-field by ![Image 33: {\displaystyle \mathbf {H} \ \equiv \ {\frac {\mathbf {B} }{\mu _{0}}}-\mathbf {M} .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c33309a5805d55e2693d904f3c1c96e6ffa5f38a)

In terms of the H-field, Ampere's law is ![Image 34: {\displaystyle \oint \mathbf {H} \cdot \mathrm {d} {\boldsymbol {\ell }}=\oint \left({\frac {\mathbf {B} }{\mu _{0}}}-\mathbf {M} \right)\cdot \mathrm {d} {\boldsymbol {\ell }}=I_{\mathrm {tot} }-I_{\mathrm {b} }=I_{\mathrm {f} },}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/14c07877a2da356deb28317727d27e1e111899ef) where I f represents the 'free current' enclosed by the loop so that the line integral of **H** does not depend at all on the bound currents.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-Slater-36)

For the differential equivalent of this equation see [Maxwell's equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#Maxwell's_equations). Ampere's law leads to the boundary condition ![Image 35: {\displaystyle \left(\mathbf {H_{1}^{\parallel }} -\mathbf {H_{2}^{\parallel }} \right)=\mathbf {K} _{\mathrm {f} }\times {\hat {\mathbf {n} }},}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2df175bdc4ade6ce983a59f98b074cd4478f0b96) where **K**f is the surface free current density and the unit normal ![Image 36: {\displaystyle {\hat {\mathbf {n} }}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/aae87b164ba005e99b51066c46d1eacc7f56564a) points in the direction from medium 2 to medium 1.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-37)

Similarly, a [surface integral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_integral "Surface integral") of **H** over any [closed surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_surface "Closed surface") is independent of the free currents and picks out the "magnetic charges" within that closed surface: ![Image 37: {\displaystyle \oint _{S}\mu _{0}\mathbf {H} \cdot \mathrm {d} \mathbf {A} =\oint _{S}(\mathbf {B} -\mu _{0}\mathbf {M} )\cdot \mathrm {d} \mathbf {A} =0-(-q_{\mathrm {M} })=q_{\mathrm {M} },}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/41357ab097d4ed6e748bffbd834c0db69fb26810)

which does not depend on the free currents.

The **H**-field, therefore, can be separated into two[[note 10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-38) independent parts: ![Image 38: {\displaystyle \mathbf {H} =\mathbf {H} _{0}+\mathbf {H} _{\mathrm {d} },}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0945fc1eb7c8628d744df0cfd2f181efe3db0a77)

where **H**0 is the applied magnetic field due only to the free currents and **H**d is the [demagnetizing field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demagnetizing_field "Demagnetizing field") due only to the bound currents.

The magnetic **H**-field, therefore, re-factors the bound current in terms of "magnetic charges". The **H** field lines loop only around "free current" and, unlike the magnetic **B** field, begins and ends near magnetic poles as well.

### Magnetism

Most materials respond to an applied **B**-field by producing their own magnetization **M** and therefore their own **B**-fields. Typically, the response is weak and exists only when the magnetic field is applied. The term _magnetism_ describes how materials respond on the microscopic level to an applied magnetic field and is used to categorize the magnetic [phase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter) "Phase (matter)") of a material. Materials are divided into groups based upon their magnetic behavior:

*   [Diamagnetic materials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamagnetism "Diamagnetism")[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-Tilley-39) produce a magnetization that opposes the magnetic field.
*   [Paramagnetic materials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramagnetism "Paramagnetism")[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-Tilley-39) produce a magnetization in the same direction as the applied magnetic field.
*   [Ferromagnetic materials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferromagnetism "Ferromagnetism") and the closely related [ferrimagnetic materials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrimagnetism "Ferrimagnetism") and [antiferromagnetic materials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiferromagnetism "Antiferromagnetism")[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-Chikazumi-40)[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-Aharoni-41) can have a magnetization independent of an applied B-field with a complex relationship between the two fields.
*   [Superconductors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superconductor "Superconductor") (and [ferromagnetic superconductors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferromagnetic_superconductor "Ferromagnetic superconductor"))[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-Bennemann-42)[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-Lewis-43) are materials that are characterized by perfect conductivity below a critical temperature and magnetic field. They also are highly magnetic and can be perfect diamagnets below a lower critical magnetic field. Superconductors often have a broad range of temperatures and magnetic fields (the so-named [mixed state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_II_superconductor#Mixed_state "Type II superconductor")) under which they exhibit a complex hysteretic dependence of **M** on **B**.

In the case of paramagnetism and diamagnetism, the magnetization **M** is often proportional to the applied magnetic field such that: ![Image 39: {\displaystyle \mathbf {B} =\mu \mathbf {H} ,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a575e79a4a2ae086cb8e2db0b14d3ddbd466df2d) where _μ_ is a material dependent parameter called the [permeability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permeability_(electromagnetism) "Permeability (electromagnetism)"). In some cases the permeability may be a second rank [tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor "Tensor") so that **H** may not point in the same direction as **B**. These relations between **B** and **H** are examples of [constitutive equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutive_equation "Constitutive equation"). However, superconductors and ferromagnets have a more complex **B**-to-**H** relation; see [magnetic hysteresis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysteresis#Magnetic_hysteresis "Hysteresis").

Stored energy
-------------

Energy is needed to generate a magnetic field both to work against the electric field that a changing magnetic field creates and to change the magnetization of any material within the magnetic field. For non-dispersive materials, this same energy is released when the magnetic field is destroyed so that the energy can be modeled as being stored in the magnetic field.

For linear, non-dispersive, materials (such that **B** = _μ_**H** where _μ_ is frequency-independent), the [energy density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_density "Energy density") is:

![Image 40: {\displaystyle u={\frac {\mathbf {B} \cdot \mathbf {H} }{2}}={\frac {\mathbf {B} \cdot \mathbf {B} }{2\mu }}={\frac {\mu \mathbf {H} \cdot \mathbf {H} }{2}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/56d2a975eb0ed09b79a50affd4cfe3deb0f238fd)

If there are no magnetic materials around then _μ_ can be replaced by _μ_ 0. The above equation cannot be used for nonlinear materials, though; a more general expression given below must be used.

In general, the incremental amount of work per unit volume _δW_ needed to cause a small change of magnetic field _δ_**B** is:

![Image 41: {\displaystyle \delta W=\mathbf {H} \cdot \delta \mathbf {B} .}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/38cbbaed7511fa5fcbe6fd25a9c11a643ca16027)

Once the relationship between **H** and **B** is known this equation is used to determine the work needed to reach a given magnetic state. For [hysteretic materials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysteresis "Hysteresis") such as ferromagnets and superconductors, the work needed also depends on how the magnetic field is created. For linear non-dispersive materials, though, the general equation leads directly to the simpler energy density equation given above.

Appearance in Maxwell's equations
---------------------------------

Like all vector fields, a magnetic field has two important mathematical properties that relates it to its _sources_. (For **B** the _sources_ are currents and changing electric fields.) These two properties, along with the two corresponding properties of the electric field, make up _Maxwell's Equations_. Maxwell's Equations together with the Lorentz force law form a complete description of [classical electrodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_electromagnetism "Classical electromagnetism") including both electricity and magnetism.

The first property is the [divergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergence "Divergence") of a vector field **A**, **∇** · **A**, which represents how **A** "flows" outward from a given point. As discussed above, a **B**-field line never starts or ends at a point but instead forms a complete loop. This is mathematically equivalent to saying that the divergence of **B** is zero. (Such vector fields are called [solenoidal vector fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solenoidal_vector_field "Solenoidal vector field").) This property is called [Gauss's law for magnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%27s_law_for_magnetism "Gauss's law for magnetism") and is equivalent to the statement that there are no isolated magnetic poles or [magnetic monopoles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_monopole "Magnetic monopole").

The second mathematical property is called the [curl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curl_(mathematics) "Curl (mathematics)"), such that **∇** × **A** represents how **A** curls or "circulates" around a given point. The result of the curl is called a "circulation source". The equations for the curl of **B** and of **E** are called the [Ampère–Maxwell equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amp%C3%A8re%E2%80%93Maxwell_equation "Ampère–Maxwell equation") and [Faraday's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday%27s_law_of_induction "Faraday's law of induction") respectively.

### Gauss' law for magnetism

One important property of the **B**-field produced this way is that magnetic **B**-field lines neither start nor end (mathematically, **B** is a [solenoidal vector field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solenoidal_vector_field "Solenoidal vector field")); a field line may only extend to infinity, or wrap around to form a closed curve, or follow a never-ending (possibly chaotic) path.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-lieb-44) Magnetic field lines exit a magnet near its north pole and enter near its south pole, but inside the magnet **B**-field lines continue through the magnet from the south pole back to the north.[[note 11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-ex08-45) If a **B**-field line enters a magnet somewhere it has to leave somewhere else; it is not allowed to have an end point.

More formally, since all the magnetic field lines that enter any given region must also leave that region, subtracting the "number"[[note 12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-ex09-46) of field lines that enter the region from the number that exit gives identically zero. Mathematically this is equivalent to [Gauss's law for magnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%27s_law_for_magnetism "Gauss's law for magnetism"): ![Image 42: {\displaystyle \oint _{S}\mathbf {B} \cdot \mathrm {d} \mathbf {A} =0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/79e91c0569752b6bf7ad9b43ad36a846c1940a72) where the integral is a [surface integral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_integral "Surface integral") over the [closed surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_surface "Closed surface")_S_ (a closed surface is one that completely surrounds a region with no holes to let any field lines escape). Since d**A** points outward, the dot product in the integral is positive for **B**-field pointing out and negative for **B**-field pointing in.

### Faraday's Law

A changing magnetic field, such as a magnet moving through a conducting coil, generates an [electric field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_field "Electric field") (and therefore tends to drive a current in such a coil). This is known as _Faraday's law_ and forms the basis of many [electrical generators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_generator "Electrical generator") and [electric motors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_motor "Electric motor"). Mathematically, Faraday's law is: ![Image 43: {\displaystyle {\mathcal {E}}=-{\frac {\mathrm {d} \Phi }{\mathrm {d} t}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/dcc4e063e3475deb0df6e0f1f05a750c4349c1ba)

where ![Image 44: {\displaystyle {\mathcal {E}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9c298ed828ff778065aeb5f0f305097f55bb9ae0) is the [electromotive force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromotive_force "Electromotive force") (or _EMF_, the [voltage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage "Voltage") generated around a closed loop) and Φ is the [magnetic flux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_flux "Magnetic flux")—the product of the area times the magnetic field [normal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangential_and_normal_components "Tangential and normal components") to that area. (This definition of magnetic flux is why **B** is often referred to as _magnetic flux density_.)[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-47): 210  The negative sign represents the fact that any current generated by a changing magnetic field in a coil produces a magnetic field that _opposes_ the _change_ in the magnetic field that induced it. This phenomenon is known as [Lenz's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenz%27s_law "Lenz's law"). This integral formulation of Faraday's law can be converted[[note 13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-ex14-48) into a differential form, which applies under slightly different conditions.

![Image 45: {\displaystyle \nabla \times \mathbf {E} =-{\frac {\partial \mathbf {B} }{\partial t}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2eb118e22c941e34f5537dbbdcaa3d7ba23603e0)

### Ampère's Law and Maxwell's correction

Similar to the way that a changing magnetic field generates an electric field, a changing electric field generates a magnetic field. This fact is known as _Maxwell's correction to Ampère's law_ and is applied as an additive term to Ampere's law as given above. This additional term is proportional to the time rate of change of the electric flux and is similar to Faraday's law above but with a different and positive constant out front. (The electric flux through an area is proportional to the area times the perpendicular part of the electric field.)

The full law including the correction term is known as the Maxwell–Ampère equation. It is not commonly given in integral form because the effect is so small that it can typically be ignored in most cases where the integral form is used.

The Maxwell term _is_ critically important in the creation and propagation of electromagnetic waves. Maxwell's correction to Ampère's Law together with Faraday's law of induction describes how mutually changing electric and magnetic fields interact to sustain each other and thus to form [electromagnetic waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_waves "Electromagnetic waves"), such as light: a changing electric field generates a changing magnetic field, which generates a changing electric field again. These, though, are usually described using the differential form of this equation given below.

![Image 46: {\displaystyle \nabla \times \mathbf {B} =\mu _{0}\mathbf {J} +\mu _{0}\varepsilon _{0}{\frac {\partial \mathbf {E} }{\partial t}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/36a7ef1851c4d9440f2adb07b0cd02a48e41481b)

where **J** is the complete microscopic [current density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_density "Current density"), and ε 0 is the [vacuum permittivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_permittivity "Vacuum permittivity").

As discussed above, materials respond to an applied electric **E** field and an applied magnetic **B** field by producing their own internal "bound" charge and current distributions that contribute to **E** and **B** but are difficult to calculate. To circumvent this problem, **H** and **D** fields are used to re-factor Maxwell's equations in terms of the _free current density_**J**f:

![Image 47: {\displaystyle \nabla \times \mathbf {H} =\mathbf {J} _{\mathrm {f} }+{\frac {\partial \mathbf {D} }{\partial t}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/380d5f3b42edfb0c7dcb8d6b4b4a060b9b5e126a)

These equations are not any more general than the original equations (if the "bound" charges and currents in the material are known). They also must be supplemented by the relationship between **B** and **H** as well as that between **E** and **D**. On the other hand, for simple relationships between these quantities this form of Maxwell's equations can circumvent the need to calculate the bound charges and currents.

Formulation in special relativity and quantum electrodynamics
-------------------------------------------------------------

### Relativistic electrodynamics

#### As different aspects of the same phenomenon

According to [the special theory of relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity "Special relativity"), the partition of the [electromagnetic force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_force "Electromagnetic force") into separate electric and magnetic components is not fundamental, but varies with the [observational frame of reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_of_reference#Observational_frames_of_reference "Frame of reference"): An electric force perceived by one observer may be perceived by another (in a different frame of reference) as a magnetic force, or a mixture of electric and magnetic forces.

The magnetic field existing as electric field in other frames can be shown by consistency of equations obtained from [Lorentz transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_transformation "Lorentz transformation") of four force from [Coulomb's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coulomb%27s_law "Coulomb's law") in particle's rest frame with [Maxwell's laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations "Maxwell's equations") considering definition of fields from [Lorentz force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_force#Lorentz_force_law_as_the_definition_of_E_and_B "Lorentz force")[_[broken anchor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS:BROKENSECTIONLINKS "MOS:BROKENSECTIONLINKS")_] and for non accelerating condition. The form of magnetic field hence obtained by [Lorentz transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_transformation "Lorentz transformation") of [four-force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-force "Four-force") from the form of [Coulomb's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coulomb%27s_law "Coulomb's law") in source's initial frame is given by:[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-Rosser1968-49): 29–42

![Image 48: {\displaystyle \mathbf {B} ={\frac {q}{4\pi \varepsilon _{0}r^{3}}}{\frac {1-\beta ^{2}}{(1-\beta ^{2}\sin ^{2}\theta )^{3/2}}}{\frac {\mathbf {v} \times \mathbf {r} }{c^{2}}}={\frac {\mathbf {v} \times \mathbf {E} }{c^{2}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c084d54172e9e0130140fad562dc6800a8f49162)

where ![Image 49: {\displaystyle q}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/06809d64fa7c817ffc7e323f85997f783dbdf71d) is the charge of the point source, ![Image 50: {\displaystyle \varepsilon _{0}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/acb0a8377db20e42274444cb181d51b5532b5844) is the [vacuum permittivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_permittivity "Vacuum permittivity"), ![Image 51: {\displaystyle \mathbf {r} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/eca0f46511c4c986c48b254073732c0bd98ae0c1) is the position vector from the point source to the point in space, ![Image 52: {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/35c1866e359fbfd2e0f606c725ba5cc37a5195d6) is the velocity vector of the charged particle, ![Image 53: {\displaystyle \beta }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7ed48a5e36207156fb792fa79d29925d2f7901e8) is the ratio of speed of the charged particle divided by the speed of light and ![Image 54: {\displaystyle \theta }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6e5ab2664b422d53eb0c7df3b87e1360d75ad9af) is the angle between ![Image 55: {\displaystyle \mathbf {r} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/eca0f46511c4c986c48b254073732c0bd98ae0c1) and ![Image 56: {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/35c1866e359fbfd2e0f606c725ba5cc37a5195d6). This form of magnetic field can be shown to satisfy Maxwell's laws within the constraint of particle being non accelerating.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-50) The above reduces to [Biot-Savart law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biot%E2%80%93Savart_law "Biot–Savart law") for non relativistic stream of current (![Image 57: {\displaystyle \beta \ll 1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a023c5789a518613947d223437d76e178e8fd607)).

Formally, special relativity combines the electric and magnetic fields into a rank-2 [tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor "Tensor"), called the _[electromagnetic tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic\_tensor "Electromagnetic tensor")_. Changing reference frames _mixes_ these components. This is analogous to the way that special relativity _mixes_ space and time into [spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime "Spacetime"), and mass, momentum, and energy into [four-momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-momentum "Four-momentum").[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-51) Similarly, the [energy stored in a magnetic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_energy "Magnetic energy") is mixed with the energy stored in an electric field in the [electromagnetic stress–energy tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_stress%E2%80%93energy_tensor "Electromagnetic stress–energy tensor").

#### Magnetic vector potential

In advanced topics such as [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics") and [relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_relativity "Theory of relativity") it is often easier to work with a potential formulation of electrodynamics rather than in terms of the electric and magnetic fields. In this representation, the _[magnetic vector potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic\_vector\_potential "Magnetic vector potential")_**A**, and the [electric scalar potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_potential "Electric potential")_φ_, are defined using [gauge fixing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_fixing "Gauge fixing") such that:

![Image 58: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\mathbf {B} &=\nabla \times \mathbf {A} ,\\\mathbf {E} &=-\nabla \varphi -{\frac {\partial \mathbf {A} }{\partial t}}.\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/727409f6151fc24d6f89c41cb664b4538cc45771)

The vector potential, _**A**_ given by this form may be interpreted as a _generalized potential [momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum "Momentum") per unit charge_[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-52) just as _φ_ is interpreted as a _generalized [potential energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential\_energy "Potential energy") per unit charge_. There are multiple choices one can make for the potential fields that satisfy the above condition. However, the choice of potentials is represented by its respective gauge condition.

Maxwell's equations when expressed in terms of the potentials in [Lorenz gauge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_gauge_condition "Lorenz gauge condition") can be cast into a form that agrees with [special relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity "Special relativity").[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-53) In relativity, **A** together with _φ_ forms a [four-potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-potential "Four-potential") regardless of the gauge condition, analogous to the [four-momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-vector#Four-momentum "Four-vector") that combines the momentum and energy of a particle. Using the four potential instead of the electromagnetic tensor has the advantage of being much simpler—and it can be easily modified to work with quantum mechanics.

#### Propagation of Electric and Magnetic fields

[Special theory of relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity "Special relativity") imposes the condition for events related by [cause and effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality "Causality") to be time-like separated, that is that causal efficacy propagates no faster than light.[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-54)[Maxwell's equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations "Maxwell's equations") for electromagnetism are found to be in favor of this as electric and magnetic disturbances are found to travel at the speed of light in space. Electric and magnetic fields from classical electrodynamics obey the [principle of locality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_locality "Principle of locality") in physics and are expressed in terms of retarded time or the time at which the cause of a measured field originated given that the influence of field travelled at speed of light. The retarded time for a point particle is given as solution of:

![Image 59: {\displaystyle t_{r}=\mathbf {t} -{\frac {\left|\mathbf {r} -\mathbf {r} _{s}(t_{r})\right|}{c}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/114b9d97f50fb187c5f6bc93cda274f1495218bc)

where ![Image 60: {\textstyle t_{r}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f08343b6fcc623fda37eae8a07e773ed32a8d0b1) is [retarded time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retarded_time "Retarded time") or the time at which the source's contribution of the field originated, ![Image 61: {\textstyle r_{s}(t)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/542c66bf47ed383692647b097a191dcc3c9b79cd) is the position vector of the particle as function of time, ![Image 62: {\textstyle \mathbf {r} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c5a91b11214869eaa0f737b2da837b549978c26d) is the point in space, ![Image 63: {\textstyle \mathbf {t} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8ec78f6d5f7bb3ff55803ad7271dc35c65598232) is the time at which fields are measured and ![Image 64: {\textstyle c}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7d411ca19645ddd4fff0704de95ec770681093bb) is the speed of light. The equation subtracts the time taken for light to travel from particle to the point in space from the time of measurement to find time of origin of the fields. The uniqueness of solution for ![Image 65: {\textstyle t_{r}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f08343b6fcc623fda37eae8a07e773ed32a8d0b1) for given ![Image 66: {\displaystyle \mathbf {t} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/16ff63cc74a931900e79b3caacbae3fa8cc66845), ![Image 67: {\displaystyle \mathbf {r} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/eca0f46511c4c986c48b254073732c0bd98ae0c1) and ![Image 68: {\displaystyle r_{s}(t)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5ff13e3015a6d8b182882d741b5ae0499a7d3562) is valid for charged particles moving slower than speed of light.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-Rosser1968-49)

#### Magnetic field of arbitrary moving point charge

The solution of maxwell's equations for electric and magnetic field of a point charge is expressed in terms of [retarded time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retarded_time "Retarded time") or the time at which the particle in the past causes the field at the point, given that the influence travels across space at the speed of light.

Any arbitrary motion of point charge causes electric and magnetic fields found by solving maxwell's equations using green's function for retarded potentials and hence finding the fields to be as follows:

Hence by the [principle of superposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superposition_principle "Superposition principle"), the fields of a system of charges also obey [principle of locality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_locality "Principle of locality").

### Quantum electrodynamics

The classical electromagnetic field incorporated into quantum mechanics forms what is known as the semi-classical theory of radiation. However, it is not able to make experimentally observed predictions such as [spontaneous emission process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_emission "Spontaneous emission") or [Lamb shift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamb_shift "Lamb shift") implying the need for quantization of fields. In modern physics, the electromagnetic field is understood to be not a _[classical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical\_physics "Classical physics")_[field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(physics) "Field (physics)"), but rather a [quantum field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field "Quantum field"); it is represented not as a vector of three [numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number") at each point, but as a vector of three [quantum operators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_(physics) "Operator (physics)") at each point. The most accurate modern description of the electromagnetic interaction (and much else) is _quantum electrodynamics_ (QED),[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-55) which is incorporated into a more complete theory known as the _Standard Model of particle physics_.

In QED, the magnitude of the electromagnetic interactions between charged particles (and their [antiparticles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiparticle "Antiparticle")) is computed using [perturbation theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perturbation_theory_(quantum_mechanics) "Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)"). These rather complex formulas produce a remarkable pictorial representation as [Feynman diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feynman_diagram "Feynman diagram") in which [virtual photons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_photon "Virtual photon") are exchanged.

Predictions of QED agree with experiments to an extremely high degree of accuracy: currently about 10−12 (and limited by experimental errors); for details see [precision tests of QED](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_tests_of_QED "Precision tests of QED"). This makes QED one of the most accurate physical theories constructed thus far.

All equations in this article are in the [classical approximation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_electromagnetism "Classical electromagnetism"), which is less accurate than the quantum description mentioned here. However, under most everyday circumstances, the difference between the two theories is negligible.

Uses and examples

### Earth's magnetic field

[![Image 77](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/VFPt_Earths_Magnetic_Field_Confusion.svg/250px-VFPt_Earths_Magnetic_Field_Confusion.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:VFPt_Earths_Magnetic_Field_Confusion.svg)

A sketch of Earth's magnetic field representing the source of the field as a magnet. The south pole of the magnetic field is near the geographic north pole of the Earth.

The Earth's magnetic field is produced by [convection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convection "Convection") of a liquid iron alloy in the [outer core](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_core "Outer core"). In a [dynamo process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamo_theory "Dynamo theory"), the movements drive a feedback process in which electric currents create electric and magnetic fields that in turn act on the currents.[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-Weiss-56)

The field at the surface of the Earth is approximately the same as if a giant bar magnet were positioned at the center of the Earth and tilted at an angle of about 11° off the rotational axis of the Earth (see the figure).[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-57) The north pole of a magnetic compass needle points roughly north, toward the [North Magnetic Pole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Magnetic_Pole "North Magnetic Pole"). However, because a magnetic pole is attracted to its opposite, the North Magnetic Pole is actually the south pole of the geomagnetic field. This confusion in terminology arises because the pole of a magnet is defined by the geographical direction it points.[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-58)

Earth's magnetic field is not constant—the strength of the field and the location of its poles vary.[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-59) Moreover, the poles periodically reverse their orientation in a process called [geomagnetic reversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomagnetic_reversal "Geomagnetic reversal"). The [most recent reversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brunhes%E2%80%93Matuyama_reversal "Brunhes–Matuyama reversal") occurred 780,000 years ago.[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-60)

### Rotating magnetic fields

The _rotating magnetic field_ is a common design principle in the operation of [alternating-current motors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_motor#AC_motors "Electric motor"). A permanent magnet in such a field rotates so as to maintain its alignment with the external field.

Magnetic torque is used to drive [electric motors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_motor "Electric motor"). In one simple motor design, a magnet is fixed to a freely rotating shaft and is subjected to a magnetic field from an array of [electromagnets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnet "Electromagnet"). By continuously switching the electric current through each of the electromagnets, thereby flipping the polarity of their magnetic fields, like poles are kept next to the rotor; the resultant torque is transferred to the shaft.

A rotating magnetic field can be constructed using two coils at right angles with a phase difference of 90 degrees between their AC currents. In practice, [three-phase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-phase_electric_power "Three-phase electric power") systems are used where the three currents are equal in magnitude and have a phase difference of 120 degrees. Three similar coils at mutual geometrical angles of 120 degrees create the rotating magnetic field. The ability of the three-phase system to create a rotating field, utilized in electric motors, is one of the main reasons why three-phase systems dominate the world's [electrical power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_power "Electrical power") supply systems.

[Synchronous motors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronous_motor "Synchronous motor") use DC-voltage-fed rotor windings, which lets the excitation of the machine be controlled—and [induction motors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induction_motor "Induction motor") use short-circuited [rotors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotor_(electric) "Rotor (electric)") (instead of a magnet) following the rotating magnetic field of a multicoiled [stator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stator "Stator"). The short-circuited turns of the rotor develop [eddy currents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddy_current "Eddy current") induced by the rotating field of the stator, and these currents in turn produce a torque on the rotor through the Lorentz force.

The Italian physicist [Galileo Ferraris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Ferraris "Galileo Ferraris") and the Serbian-American [electrical engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_engineer "Electrical engineer")[Nikola Tesla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla "Nikola Tesla") independently researched the use of rotating magnetic fields in electric motors. In 1888, Ferraris published his research in a paper to the _Royal Academy of Sciences_ in [Turin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turin "Turin") and Tesla gained [U.S. patent 381,968](https://patents.google.com/patent/US381968) for his work.

### Hall effect

The charge carriers of a current-carrying conductor placed in a transverse magnetic field experience a sideways Lorentz force; this results in a charge separation in a direction perpendicular to the current and to the magnetic field. The resultant voltage in that direction is proportional to the applied magnetic field. This is known as the _Hall effect_.

The _Hall effect_ is often used to measure the magnitude of a magnetic field. It is used as well to find the sign of the dominant charge carriers in materials such as semiconductors (negative electrons or positive holes).

### Magnetic circuits

An important use of **H** is in _magnetic circuits_ where **B** = _μ_**H** inside a linear material. Here, _μ_ is the [magnetic permeability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_permeability "Magnetic permeability") of the material. This result is similar in form to [Ohm's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm%27s_law "Ohm's law")**J** = _σ_**E**, where **J** is the current density, _σ_ is the conductance and **E** is the electric field. Extending this analogy, the counterpart to the macroscopic Ohm's law (_I_ = _V_⁄_R_) is:

![Image 78: {\displaystyle \Phi ={\frac {F}{R}}_{\mathrm {m} },}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/18a0f4b5e7c42f2f7ba26fca357bac5ed9a2cf6a)

where ![Image 79: {\textstyle \Phi =\int \mathbf {B} \cdot \mathrm {d} \mathbf {A} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/741ae04e7f140c9dbc036abcfe61329eb5ef192c) is the magnetic flux in the circuit, ![Image 80: {\textstyle F=\int \mathbf {H} \cdot \mathrm {d} {\boldsymbol {\ell }}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/eaf4a3fd61dd5f4825fa3ae0452aa129020f1827) is the [magnetomotive force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetomotive_force "Magnetomotive force") applied to the circuit, and _R_ m is the [reluctance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reluctance "Reluctance") of the circuit. Here the reluctance _R_ m is a quantity similar in nature to [resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance "Electrical resistance") for the flux. Using this analogy it is straightforward to calculate the magnetic flux of complicated magnetic field geometries, by using all the available techniques of [circuit theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_theory "Circuit theory").

### Largest magnitude magnetic fields

Last update: October 2018 _(July 2021)_

As of October 2018, the largest magnitude magnetic field produced over a macroscopic volume outside a lab setting is 2.8 kT ([VNIIEF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VNIIEF "VNIIEF") in [Sarov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarov "Sarov"), [Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia "Russia"), 1998).[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-61)[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-smithsonianMagnetRecord-62) As of October 2018, the largest magnitude magnetic field produced in a laboratory over a macroscopic volume was 1.2 kT by researchers at the [University of Tokyo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Tokyo "University of Tokyo") in 2018.[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-smithsonianMagnetRecord-62) The largest magnitude magnetic fields produced in a laboratory occur in particle accelerators, such as [RHIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativistic_Heavy_Ion_Collider "Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider"), inside the collisions of heavy ions, where microscopic fields reach 10 14 T.[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-63)[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-64)[Magnetars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetar "Magnetar") have the strongest known magnetic fields of any naturally occurring object, ranging from 0.1 to 100 GT (10 8 to 10 11 T).[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-65)

[![Image 123](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/Descartes_magnetic_field.jpg/330px-Descartes_magnetic_field.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Descartes_magnetic_field.jpg)

One of the first drawings of a magnetic field, by [René Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes "René Descartes"), 1644, showing the Earth attracting [lodestones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lodestone "Lodestone"). It illustrated his theory that magnetism was caused by the circulation of tiny helical particles, "threaded parts", through threaded pores in magnets.

### Early developments

While magnets and some properties of magnetism were known to ancient societies, the research of magnetic fields began in 1269 when French scholar [Petrus Peregrinus de Maricourt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrus_Peregrinus_de_Maricourt "Petrus Peregrinus de Maricourt") mapped out the magnetic field on the surface of a spherical magnet using iron needles. Noting the resulting field lines crossed at two points he named those points "poles" in analogy to Earth's poles. He also articulated the principle that magnets always have both a north and south pole, no matter how finely one slices them.[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-66)[[note 14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-67)

Almost three centuries later, [William Gilbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Gilbert_(astronomer) "William Gilbert (astronomer)") of [Colchester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colchester "Colchester") replicated Petrus Peregrinus' work and was the first to state explicitly that Earth is a magnet.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-Whittaker1910-68): 34  Published in 1600, Gilbert's work, _[De Magnete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De\_Magnete "De Magnete")_, helped to establish magnetism as a science.

### Mathematical development

[Hans Christian Ørsted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Christian_%C3%98rsted "Hans Christian Ørsted"), _Der Geist in der Natur_, 1854

In 1750, [John Michell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Michell "John Michell") stated that magnetic poles attract and repel in accordance with an [inverse square law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_square_law "Inverse square law")[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-Whittaker1910-68): 56 [Charles-Augustin de Coulomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles-Augustin_de_Coulomb "Charles-Augustin de Coulomb") experimentally verified this in 1785 and stated explicitly that north and south poles cannot be separated.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-Whittaker1910-68): 59  Building on this force between poles, [Siméon Denis Poisson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sim%C3%A9on_Denis_Poisson "Siméon Denis Poisson") (1781–1840) created the first successful model of the magnetic field, which he presented in 1824.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-Whittaker1910-68): 64  In this model, a magnetic **H**-field is produced by _magnetic poles_ and magnetism is due to small pairs of north–south magnetic poles.

Three discoveries in 1820 challenged this foundation of magnetism. [Hans Christian Ørsted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Christian_%C3%98rsted "Hans Christian Ørsted") demonstrated that a current-carrying wire is surrounded by a circular magnetic field.[[note 15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-69)[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-70) Then [André-Marie Ampère](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9-Marie_Amp%C3%A8re "André-Marie Ampère") showed that parallel wires with currents attract one another if the currents are in the same direction and repel if they are in opposite directions.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-Whittaker1910-68): 87 [[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-71) Finally, [Jean-Baptiste Biot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Baptiste_Biot "Jean-Baptiste Biot") and [Félix Savart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%A9lix_Savart "Félix Savart") announced empirical results about the forces that a current-carrying long, straight wire exerted on a small magnet, determining the forces were inversely proportional to the perpendicular distance from the wire to the magnet.[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-Tricker23-72)[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-Whittaker1910-68): 86 [Laplace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace "Laplace") later deduced a law of force based on the differential action of a differential section of the wire,[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-Tricker23-72)[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-73) which became known as the [Biot–Savart law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biot%E2%80%93Savart_law "Biot–Savart law"), as Laplace did not publish his findings.[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-74)

Extending these experiments, Ampère published his own successful model of magnetism in 1825. In it, he showed the equivalence of electrical currents to magnets[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-Whittaker1910-68): 88  and proposed that magnetism is due to perpetually flowing loops of current instead of the dipoles of magnetic charge in Poisson's model.[[note 16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-75) Further, Ampère derived both [Ampère's force law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amp%C3%A8re%27s_force_law "Ampère's force law") describing the force between two currents and [Ampère's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amp%C3%A8re%27s_law "Ampère's law"), which, like the Biot–Savart law, correctly described the magnetic field generated by a steady current. Also in this work, Ampère introduced the term [electrodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrodynamics "Electrodynamics") to describe the relationship between electricity and magnetism.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-Whittaker1910-68): 88–92

In 1831, [Michael Faraday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Faraday "Michael Faraday") discovered [electromagnetic induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_induction "Electromagnetic induction") when he found that a changing magnetic field generates an encircling electric field, formulating what is now known as [Faraday's law of induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday%27s_law_of_induction "Faraday's law of induction").[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-Whittaker1910-68): 189–192  Later, [Franz Ernst Neumann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Ernst_Neumann "Franz Ernst Neumann") proved that, for a moving conductor in a magnetic field, induction is a consequence of Ampère's force law.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-Whittaker1910-68): 222  In the process, he introduced the magnetic vector potential, which was later shown to be equivalent to the underlying mechanism proposed by Faraday.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-Whittaker1910-68): 225

In 1850, [Lord Kelvin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Kelvin "Lord Kelvin"), then known as William Thomson, distinguished between two magnetic fields now denoted **H** and **B**. The former applied to Poisson's model and the latter to Ampère's model and induction.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-Whittaker1910-68): 224  Further, he derived how **H** and **B** relate to each other and coined the term _permeability_.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-Whittaker1910-68): 245 [[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-76)

Between 1861 and 1865, [James Clerk Maxwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell "James Clerk Maxwell") developed and published [Maxwell's equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations "Maxwell's equations"), which explained and united all of [classical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_theory "Classical theory") electricity and magnetism. The first set of these equations was published in a paper entitled _[On Physical Lines of Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=CCommons:File:On\_Physical\_Lines\_of\_Force.pdf&action=edit&redlink=1 "CCommons:File:On Physical Lines of Force.pdf (page does not exist)")_ in 1861. These equations were valid but incomplete. Maxwell completed his set of equations in his later 1865 paper _[A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A\_Dynamical\_Theory\_of\_the\_Electromagnetic\_Field "A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field")_ and demonstrated the fact that light is an [electromagnetic wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_wave "Electromagnetic wave"). [Heinrich Hertz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Hertz "Heinrich Hertz") published papers in 1887 and 1888 experimentally confirming this fact.[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-h202-77)[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-78)

### Modern developments

In 1887, Tesla developed an [induction motor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induction_motor "Induction motor") that ran on [alternating current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternating_current "Alternating current"). The motor used [polyphase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphase_system "Polyphase system") current, which generated a [rotating magnetic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotating_magnetic_field "Rotating magnetic field") to turn the motor (a principle that Tesla claimed to have conceived in 1882).[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-79)[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-80)[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-81) Tesla received a patent for his electric motor in May 1888.[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-82)[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-83) In 1885, [Galileo Ferraris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Ferraris "Galileo Ferraris") independently researched rotating magnetic fields and subsequently published his research in a paper to the _Royal Academy of Sciences_ in [Turin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turin "Turin"), just two months before Tesla was awarded his patent, in March 1888.[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-84)

The twentieth century showed that classical electrodynamics is already consistent with special relativity, and extended classical electrodynamics to work with quantum mechanics. [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein"), in his paper of 1905 that established relativity, showed that both the electric and magnetic fields are part of the same phenomena viewed from different reference frames. Finally, the emergent field of [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics") was merged with electrodynamics to form [quantum electrodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_electrodynamics "Quantum electrodynamics"), which first formalized the notion that electromagnetic field energy is quantized in the form of photons.

For many quantities, he simply started choosing letters from the beginning of the alphabet. See Ralph Baierlein (2000). "Answer to Question #73.

This seems clumsy and pedantic. If you go into the laboratory and ask a physicist what causes the pion trajectories in his bubble chamber to curve, he'll probably answer "magnetic field", not "magnetic induction." You will seldom hear a geophysicist refer to the Earth's magnetic induction, or an astrophysicist talk about the magnetic induction of the galaxy. We propose to keep on calling **B** the magnetic field. As for **H**, although other names have been invented for it, we shall call it "the field **H**" or even "the magnetic field **H**."_ In a similar vein, M Gerloch (1983). [_Magnetism and Ligand-field Analysis_](https://books.google.com/books?id=Ovo8AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA110). Cambridge University Press. p.110. [ISBN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISBN_(identifier) "ISBN (identifier)")[978-0-521-24939-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:BookSources/978-0-521-24939-3 "Special:BookSources/978-0-521-24939-3"). says: "So we may think of both **B** and **H** as magnetic fields, but drop the word 'magnetic' from **H** so as to maintain the distinction ... As Purcell points out, 'it is only the names that give trouble, not the symbols'."
3.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_ref-14 "Jump up")**An alternative mnemonic to the right hand rule is [Fleming's left-hand rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleming%27s_left-hand_rule_for_motors "Fleming's left-hand rule for motors").
4.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_ref-16 "Jump up")**The SI unit of Φ _B_ ([magnetic flux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_flux "Magnetic flux")) is the [weber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weber_(unit) "Weber (unit)") (symbol: Wb), related to the [tesla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_(unit) "Tesla (unit)") by 1 Wb/m 2 = 1 T. The SI unit tesla is equal to ([newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_(unit) "Newton (unit)")·[second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second "Second"))/([coulomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coulomb_(unit) "Coulomb (unit)")·[metre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre "Metre")). This can be seen from the magnetic part of the Lorentz force law.
5.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_ref-ex07_21-0 "Jump up")**The use of iron filings to display a field presents something of an exception to this picture; the filings alter the magnetic field so that it is much larger along the "lines" of iron, because of the large [permeability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_permeability "Magnetic permeability") of iron relative to air.
6.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_ref-ex05_22-0 "Jump up")**Here, "small" means that the observer is sufficiently far away from the magnet, so that the magnet can be considered as infinitesimally small. "Larger" magnets need to include more complicated terms in the mathematical expression of the magnetic field and depend on the entire geometry of the magnet not just **m**.
7.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_ref-ex04_25-0 "Jump up")**Either **B** or **H** may be used for the magnetic field outside the magnet.
8.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_ref-ex12_29-0 "Jump up")**In practice, the Biot–Savart law and other laws of magnetostatics are often used even when a current change in time, as long as it does not change too quickly. It is often used, for instance, for standard household currents, which oscillate sixty times per second.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-Griffiths4ed-28): 223 
9.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_ref-ex13_31-0 "Jump up")** The Biot–Savart law contains the additional restriction (boundary condition) that the B-field must go to zero fast enough at infinity. It also depends on the divergence of **B** being zero, which is always valid. (There are no magnetic charges.)
10.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_ref-38 "Jump up")**A third term is needed for changing electric fields and polarization currents; this displacement current term is covered in Maxwell's equations below.
11.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_ref-ex08_45-0 "Jump up")**To see that this must be true imagine placing a compass inside a magnet. There, the north pole of the compass points toward the north pole of the magnet since magnets stacked on each other point in the same direction.
12.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_ref-ex09_46-0 "Jump up")**As discussed above, magnetic field lines are primarily a conceptual tool used to represent the mathematics behind magnetic fields. The total "number" of field lines is dependent on how the field lines are drawn. In practice, integral equations such as the one that follows in the main text are used instead.
13.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_ref-ex14_48-0 "Jump up")** A complete expression for Faraday's law of induction in terms of the electric **E** and magnetic fields can be written as: ![Image 125: {\displaystyle {\mathcal {E}}=-{\frac {d\Phi }{dt}}=\oint _{\partial \Sigma (t)}\left(\mathbf {E} (\mathbf {r} ,\ t)+\mathbf {v} \times \mathbf {B} (\mathbf {r} ,\ t)\right)\cdot d{\boldsymbol {\ell }}\ =-{\frac {d}{dt}}\iint _{\Sigma (t)}d{\boldsymbol {A}}\cdot \mathbf {B} (\mathbf {r} ,\ t)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7e8abb40ebcc28ab6cc1fe51d9138984481e8827) where **∂Σ**(_t_) is the moving closed path bounding the moving surface **Σ**(_t_), and d**A** is an element of surface area of **Σ**(_t_). The first integral calculates the work done moving a charge a distance d**ℓ** based upon the Lorentz force law. In the case where the bounding surface is stationary, the [Kelvin–Stokes theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin%E2%80%93Stokes_theorem "Kelvin–Stokes theorem") can be used to show this equation is equivalent to the Maxwell–Faraday equation.

15.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_ref-69 "Jump up")**During a lecture demonstration on the effects of a current on a campus needle, Ørsted showed that when a current-carrying wire is placed at a right angle with the compass, nothing happens. When he tried to orient the wire parallel to the compass needle, however, it produced a pronounced deflection of the compass needle. By placing the compass on different sides of the wire, he was able to determine the field forms perfect circles around the wire.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_note-Whittaker1910-68): 85 
16.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field#cite_ref-75 "Jump up")**From the outside, the field of a dipole of magnetic charge has exactly the same form as a current loop when both are sufficiently small. Therefore, the two models differ only for magnetism inside magnetic material.
