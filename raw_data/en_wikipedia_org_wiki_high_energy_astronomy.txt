It includes X-ray astronomy , gamma-ray astronomy , extreme UV astronomy , neutrino astronomy , and studies of cosmic rays .  The physical study of these phenomena is referred to as high-energy astrophysics .

[ 1 ] Astronomical objects commonly studied in this field may include black holes , neutron stars , active galactic nuclei , supernovae , kilonovae , supernova remnants , and gamma-ray bursts .

Missions [ edit ] Some space and ground-based telescopes that have studied high energy astronomy include the following: [ 2 ] AGILE AMS-02 AUGER CALET Chandra Fermi HAWC H.E.S.S.
