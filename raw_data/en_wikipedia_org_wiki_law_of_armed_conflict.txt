The [First Geneva Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Geneva_Convention "First Geneva Convention") governing the sick and wounded members of armed forces was signed in 1864.

The **law of war** is a component of [international law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law "International law") that regulates the conditions for initiating [war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War "War") (_[jus ad bellum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jus\_ad\_bellum "Jus ad bellum")_) and the conduct of hostilities (_jus in bello_). Laws of war define sovereignty and nationhood, states and territories, occupation, and other critical terms of law.

Among other issues, modern laws of war address the [declarations of war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_war "Declaration of war"), acceptance of [surrender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrender_(military) "Surrender (military)") and the treatment of [prisoners of war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner_of_war "Prisoner of war"), [military necessity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_necessity "Military necessity"), along with [_distinction_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distinction_(law) "Distinction (law)") and [_proportionality_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportionality_(law) "Proportionality (law)"); and the prohibition of certain [weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapons "Weapons") that may cause unnecessary suffering.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_armed_conflict#cite_note-What_is_IHL?-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_armed_conflict#cite_note-2)

The _law of war_ is considered distinct from other bodies of law—such as the [domestic law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_law "Domestic law") of a particular belligerent to a conflict—which may provide additional legal limits to the conduct or [justification of war.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_war_theory "Just war theory")

Early sources and history
-------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Law_of_war&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Early sources and history")]

The first traces of a law of war come from the Babylonians. It is the [Code of Hammurabi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_of_Hammurabi "Code of Hammurabi"),[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_armed_conflict#cite_note-3) king of Babylon, which in 1750 B.C., explains its laws imposing a code of conduct in the event of war:

> I prescribe these laws so that the strong do not oppress the weak.

An example from the [Book of Deuteronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Deuteronomy "Book of Deuteronomy") 20:19–20 limits the amount of environmental damage, allowing only the cutting down of non-fruitful trees for use in the siege operation, while fruitful trees should be preserved for use as a food source. Similarly, Deuteronomy 21:10–14 requires that female captives who were forced to marry the victors of a war, then not desired anymore, be let go wherever they want, and requires them not to be treated as slaves nor be sold for money.

In the early 7th century, the first [Sunni Muslim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunni_Islam "Sunni Islam")[caliph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caliph "Caliph"), [Abu Bakr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Bakr "Abu Bakr"), whilst instructing his [Muslim army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashidun_army "Rashidun army"), laid down rules against the mutilation of corpses, killing children, women, and the elderly. He also laid down rules against environmental harm to trees and slaying of the enemy's animals:

> Stop, O people, that I may give you ten rules for your guidance in the battlefield. Do not commit treachery or deviate from the right path. You must not mutilate dead bodies. Neither kill a child, nor a woman, nor an aged man. Bring no harm to the trees, nor burn them with fire, especially those which are fruitful. Slay not any of the enemy's flock, save for your food. You are likely to pass by people who have devoted their lives to monastic services; leave them alone.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_armed_conflict#cite_note-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_armed_conflict#cite_note-Zuhur-5)

In the history of the early Christian church, many Christian writers considered that Christians could not be soldiers or fight wars. [Augustine of Hippo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo "Augustine of Hippo") contradicted this and wrote about '[just war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_war "Just war")' doctrine, in which he explained the circumstances when war could or could not be morally [justified.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_war_theory "Just war theory")

In 697, [Adomnan of Iona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adomnan_of_Iona "Adomnan of Iona") gathered Kings and church leaders from around Ireland and Scotland to [Birr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birr,_County_Offaly "Birr, County Offaly"), where he gave them the '[Law of the Innocents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%A1in_Adomn%C3%A1in "Cáin Adomnáin")', which banned killing women and children in war, and the destruction of churches.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_armed_conflict#cite_note-6)

Apart from [chivalry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chivalry "Chivalry") in [medieval Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages "Middle Ages"), the [Roman Catholic Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church "Roman Catholic Church") also began promulgating teachings on [just war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_war "Just war"), reflected to some extent in movements such as the [Peace and Truce of God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_and_Truce_of_God "Peace and Truce of God"). The impulse to restrict the extent of warfare, and especially protect the lives and property of [non-combatants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-combatant "Non-combatant") continued with [Hugo Grotius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Grotius "Hugo Grotius") and his attempts to write laws of war.

The signing of the [First Geneva Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Geneva_Convention "First Geneva Convention") by some of the major European powers in 1864

The modern law of war is made up from three principal sources:[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_armed_conflict#cite_note-What_is_IHL?-1)

*   _Lawmaking [treaties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty "Treaty")_ (or _conventions_)—see [§ International treaties on the laws of war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_armed_conflict#International_treaties_on_the_laws_of_war) below.
*   _Custom_. Not all the law of war derives from or has been incorporated in such treaties, which can refer to the continuing importance of customary law as articulated by the [Martens Clause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martens_Clause "Martens Clause"). Such [customary international law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customary_international_law "Customary international law") is established by the general practice of nations together with their [acceptance that such practice is required by law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinio_juris_sive_necessitatis "Opinio juris sive necessitatis").
*   _General Principles_. "Certain fundamental principles provide basic guidance. For instance, the principles of distinction, proportionality, and necessity, all of which are part of customary international law, always apply to the use of armed force."[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_armed_conflict#cite_note-What_is_IHL?-1)

[Positive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_law "Positive law")[international humanitarian law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_humanitarian_law "International humanitarian law") consists of [treaties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty "Treaty") (international agreements) that directly affect the laws of war by binding consenting nations and achieving widespread consent.

The opposite of positive laws of war is customary laws of war,[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_armed_conflict#cite_note-What_is_IHL?-1) many of which were explored at the [Nuremberg War Trials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_War_Trials "Nuremberg War Trials"). These laws define both the _permissive_ rights of states as well as _prohibitions_ on their conduct when dealing with [irregular forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irregular_military "Irregular military") and non-signatories.

The Treaty of Armistice and Regularization of War signed on November 25 and 26, 1820 between the president of the [Republic of Colombia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gran_Colombia "Gran Colombia"), [Simón Bolívar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sim%C3%B3n_Bol%C3%ADvar "Simón Bolívar") and the Chief of the Military Forces of the [Spanish Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Spain_(1810%E2%80%9373) "History of Spain (1810–73)"), [Pablo Morillo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_Morillo "Pablo Morillo"), is the precursor of the International Humanitarian Law.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_armed_conflict#cite_note-7) The [Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Guadalupe_Hidalgo "Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo"), signed and ratified by the United States and Mexico in 1848, articulates rules for any future wars, including protection of civilians and treatment of prisoners of war.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_armed_conflict#cite_note-8) The [Lieber Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieber_Code "Lieber Code"), promulgated by the Union during the [American Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War "American Civil War"), was critical in the development of the laws of land warfare.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_armed_conflict#cite_note-9)

Historian Geoffrey Best called the period from 1856 to 1909 the law of war's "epoch of highest repute."[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_armed_conflict#cite_note-10) The defining aspect of this period was the establishment, by states, of a positive legal or legislative foundation (i.e., written) superseding a regime based primarily on religion, chivalry, and customs.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_armed_conflict#cite_note-11) It is during this "modern" era that the international conference became the forum for debate and agreement between states and the "multilateral treaty" served as the positive mechanism for codification.

The Nuremberg War Trial judgment on "The Law Relating to War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity"[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_armed_conflict#cite_note-12) held, under the guidelines [Nuremberg Principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Principles "Nuremberg Principles"), that treaties like the [Hague Convention of 1907](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hague_Convention_of_1907 "Hague Convention of 1907"), having been widely accepted by "all civilised nations" for about half a century, were by then part of the customary laws of war and binding on all parties whether the party was a signatory to the specific treaty or not.

Interpretations of international humanitarian law change over time and this also affects the laws of war. For example, [Carla Del Ponte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carla_Del_Ponte "Carla Del Ponte"), the chief prosecutor for the [International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Criminal_Tribunal_for_the_former_Yugoslavia "International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia") pointed out in 2001 that although there is no specific treaty ban on the use of [depleted uranium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depleted_uranium "Depleted uranium") projectiles, there is a developing scientific debate and concern expressed regarding the effect of the use of such projectiles and it is possible that, in future, there may be a consensus view in international legal circles that use of such projectiles violates general principles of the law applicable to use of weapons in armed conflict.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_armed_conflict#cite_note-13) This is because in the future it may be the consensus view that depleted uranium projectiles breach one or more of the following treaties: [The Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights "The Universal Declaration of Human Rights"), [Charter of the United Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter_of_the_United_Nations "Charter of the United Nations"), [Genocide Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_on_the_Prevention_and_Punishment_of_the_Crime_of_Genocide "Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide"), [United Nations Convention Against Torture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Convention_Against_Torture "United Nations Convention Against Torture"), [Geneva Conventions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_Conventions "Geneva Conventions") including [Protocol I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_I "Protocol I"), [Convention on Conventional Weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_on_Conventional_Weapons "Convention on Conventional Weapons") of 1980, [Chemical Weapons Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_Weapons_Convention "Chemical Weapons Convention"), and [Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_on_the_Physical_Protection_of_Nuclear_Material "Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material").[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_armed_conflict#cite_note-14) The lack of a formal final authority on [international law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law "International law") and warfare further aggravate this problem. The lack of a final authority leaves states open to interpret the laws of war in their advantage, because they know there will not be severe punishment.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_armed_conflict#cite_note-15)

It has often been commented that creating laws for something as inherently lawless as war seems like a lesson in absurdity. But based on the adherence to what amounted to [customary international humanitarian law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customary_international_humanitarian_law "Customary international humanitarian law") by warring parties through the ages, it was believed by many, especially after the eighteenth century, that codifying laws of war would be beneficial.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_armed_conflict#cite_note-16) Classifications of what kind of conflict is taking place is also important. Depending on how a conflict is classified certain actors may or may not use force against another power. This can lead to tactical classification of a conflict so that one actor has the sole right of force. Sometimes a new body of law is even created to do so.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_armed_conflict#cite_note-17)

Some of the central principles underlying laws of war are:[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

*   Wars should be limited to achieving the political goals that started the war (e.g., territorial control) and should not include unnecessary destruction.
*   Wars should be brought to an end as quickly as possible.
*   People and property that do not contribute to the war effort should be protected against unnecessary destruction and hardship.

To this end, laws of war are intended to mitigate the hardships of war by:

*   Protecting both [combatants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combatant "Combatant") and [protected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protected_persons "Protected persons")[non-combatants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-combatant "Non-combatant") from unnecessary suffering.
*   Safeguarding certain fundamental [human rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights "Human rights") of protected persons who fall into the hands of the enemy, particularly [prisoners of war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoners_of_war "Prisoners of war"), the wounded and sick, children, and protected [civilians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilians "Civilians").
*   Facilitating the restoration of [peace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace "Peace").

The idea that there is a right to war concerns, on the one hand, the jus ad bellum, the right to make war or to enter war, assuming a motive such as to defend oneself from a threat or danger, presupposes a declaration of war that warns the adversary: war is a loyal act, and on the other hand, jus in bello, the law of war, the way of making war, which involves behaving as soldiers invested with a mission for which all violence is not allowed. In any case, the very idea of a right to war is based on an idea of war that can be defined as an armed conflict, limited in space, limited in time, and by its objectives. War begins with a declaration (of war), ends with a treaty (of peace) or surrender agreement, an act of sharing, etc.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_armed_conflict#cite_note-18) Laws of war serve the conflicts that are currently taking place. As conflicts change over time so do the laws that govern them. New laws can therefore be created. This is recently seen in the "[assassination policies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination "Assassination")" adopted during the "[War on Terror](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_terror "War on terror")".[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_armed_conflict#cite_note-19)

A 1904 article outlining the basic principles of the law of war, as published in _[the Tacoma Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Tacoma\_Times "The Tacoma Times")_

_[Military necessity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military\_necessity "Military necessity"),_ along with _[distinction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distinction\_(law) "Distinction (law)"),_ _[proportionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportionality\_(international\_humanitarian\_law) "Proportionality (international humanitarian law)"),_ _[humanity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanity\_(virtue) "Humanity (virtue)")_ (sometimes called unnecessary suffering), and _[honor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honor "Honor")_(sometimes called chivalry) are the five most commonly cited principles of [international humanitarian law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_humanitarian_law "International humanitarian law") governing the legal [use of force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_of_force_in_international_law "Use of force in international law") in an armed conflict.

_Military necessity_ is governed by several constraints: an attack or action must be intended to help in the defeat of the enemy; it must be an attack on a [legitimate military objective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legitimate_military_target "Legitimate military target"),[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_armed_conflict#cite_note-military_objective-20) and the harm caused to protected civilians or civilian property must be proportional and not excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_armed_conflict#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMoreno-Ocampo2006See_section_%22Allegations_concerning_War_Crimes%22_Pages_4,5-21)

_Distinction_ is a principle under international humanitarian law governing the legal use of force in an armed conflict, whereby [belligerents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belligerent "Belligerent") must distinguish between [combatants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combatant "Combatant") and protected [civilians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian "Civilian").[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_armed_conflict#cite_note-22)[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_armed_conflict#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGreenberg2011''Illegal_Targeting_of_Civilians''-23)

_Proportionality_ is a principle under international humanitarian law governing the legal use of force in an armed conflict, whereby belligerents must make sure that the harm caused to protected civilians or civilian property is not excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage expected by an attack on a legitimate military objective.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_armed_conflict#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMoreno-Ocampo2006See_section_%22Allegations_concerning_War_Crimes%22_Pages_4,5-21) However, as Robbie Sabel, Professor of international law at the Hebrew University, who has written on this topic, notes: “Anyone with experience in armed conflict knows that you want to hit the enemy’s forces harder than they hit you… if you are attacked with a rifle, there is no rule that stipulates that you can only shoot back with a rifle, but using a machine gun would not be fair, or that if you are attacked with only one tank you cannot shoot back with two.”[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_armed_conflict#cite_note-24)

_Humanity_ is a principle based on the 1907 Hague Convention _IV - The Laws and Customs of War on Land_ restrictions against using arms, projectiles, or materials calculated to cause suffering or injury manifestly disproportionate to the military advantage realized by the use of the weapon for legitimate military purposes. In some countries, weapons are reviewed prior to their use in combat to determine if they comply with the law of war and are not designed to cause unnecessary suffering when used in their intended manner. This principle also prohibits using an otherwise lawful weapon in a manner that causes unnecessary suffering.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_armed_conflict#cite_note-USAF-25)

_Honour_ is a principle that demands a certain amount of fairness and mutual respect between adversaries. Parties to a conflict must accept that their right to adopt means of injuring each other is not unlimited, they must refrain from taking advantage of the adversary's adherence to the law by falsely claiming the law's protections, and they must recognize that they are members of a common profession that fights not out of personal hostility but on behalf of their respective States.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_armed_conflict#cite_note-USAF-25)

Substantive examples
--------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Law_of_war&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Substantive examples")]

To fulfill the purposes noted above, the laws of war place substantive limits on the lawful exercise of a belligerent's power. Generally speaking, the laws require that belligerents refrain from employing violence that is not reasonably necessary for military purposes and that belligerents conduct hostilities with regard for the principles of humanity and [chivalry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chivalry "Chivalry").

However, because the laws of war are based on consensus (as the nature of international law often relies on self-policing by individual states), the content and interpretation of such laws are extensive, contested, and ever-changing.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_armed_conflict#cite_note-26)

The following are particular examples of some of the substance of the laws of war, as those laws are interpreted today.

Section III of the [Hague Convention of 1907](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hague_Convention_of_1907 "Hague Convention of 1907") required hostilities to be preceded by a reasoned [declaration of war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_war "Declaration of war") or by an ultimatum with a conditional declaration of war.

Some treaties, notably the [United Nations Charter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Charter "United Nations Charter") (1945) Article 2,[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_armed_conflict#cite_note-27) and other articles in the Charter, seek to curtail the right of member states to declare war; as does the older [Kellogg–Briand Pact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kellogg%E2%80%93Briand_Pact "Kellogg–Briand Pact") of 1928 for those nations who ratified it.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_armed_conflict#cite_note-28) These have led to fewer modern armed conflicts being preceded by formal declarations of war, undermining the objectives of the Hague Convention.

### Lawful conduct of belligerent actors

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Law_of_war&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Lawful conduct of belligerent actors")]

Modern laws of war regarding conduct during war (_jus in bello_), such as the [1949 Geneva Conventions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1949_Geneva_Conventions "1949 Geneva Conventions"), provide that it is unlawful for belligerents to engage in combat without meeting certain requirements. Article 4(a)(2) of the _Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War_ recognizes Lawful Combatants by the following characteristics:

*   (a) That of being commanded by a person responsible for his subordinates;
*   (b) That of having a fixed distinctive sign recognizable at a distance;
*   (c) That of carrying arms openly; and
*   (d) That of conducting their operations in accordance with the laws and customs of war.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_armed_conflict#cite_note-29)

Impersonating enemy combatants by wearing the enemy's uniform is possibly allowed, however the issue is unsettled. Fighting in that uniform is unlawful [perfidy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfidy "Perfidy"),[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_armed_conflict#cite_note-30) as is the taking of [hostages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage "Hostage")[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_].

Combatants also must be commanded by a responsible officer. That is, a commander can be held liable in a court of law for the improper actions of their subordinates. There is an exception to this if the war came on so suddenly that there was no time to organize a resistance, e.g. as a result of a [foreign occupation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_occupation "Foreign occupation").[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

### People parachuting from an aircraft in distress

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Law_of_war&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: People parachuting from an aircraft in distress")]

Modern laws of war, specifically within [Protocol I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_I "Protocol I") additional to the 1949 Geneva Conventions, prohibits attacking people parachuting from an aircraft in distress regardless of what territory they are over. Once they land in territory controlled by the enemy, they must be given an opportunity to surrender before being attacked unless it is apparent that they are engaging in a hostile act or attempting to escape. This prohibition does not apply to the dropping of [airborne troops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airborne_troops "Airborne troops"), [special forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_forces "Special forces"), [commandos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commandos "Commandos"), [spies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage "Espionage"), [saboteurs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saboteurs "Saboteurs"), [liaison officers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liaison_officer "Liaison officer"), and [intelligence agents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_agency "Intelligence agency"). Thus, such personnel descending by parachutes are legitimate targets and, therefore, may be attacked, even if their aircraft is in distress.

The emblem of the [International Committee of the Red Cross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Committee_of_the_Red_Cross "International Committee of the Red Cross") (French: _Comité international de la croix-rouge_)

Modern laws of war, such as the 1949 Geneva Conventions, also include prohibitions on attacking [doctors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician "Physician"), [ambulances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulance "Ambulance") or [hospital ships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital_ship "Hospital ship") displaying a [Red Cross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Cross_(emblem) "Red Cross (emblem)"), a [Red Crescent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Crescent_(emblem) "Red Crescent (emblem)"), [Magen David Adom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magen_David_Adom "Magen David Adom"), [Red Crystal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emblems_of_the_International_Red_Cross_and_Red_Crescent_Movement#Red_Crystal "Emblems of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement"), or other emblem related to the [International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Red_Cross_and_Red_Crescent_Movement "International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement"). It is also prohibited to fire at a person or vehicle bearing a [white flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_flag "White flag"), since that indicates an intent to surrender or a desire to communicate.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_armed_conflict#cite_note-auto-31)

In either case, people protected by the Red Cross/Crescent/Star or white flag are expected to maintain neutrality, and may not engage in warlike acts. In fact, engaging in war activities under a protected symbol is itself a violation of the laws of war known as [perfidy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfidy "Perfidy"). Failure to follow these requirements can result in the loss of protected status and make the individual violating the requirements a lawful target.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_armed_conflict#cite_note-auto-31)

Applicability to states and individuals
---------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Law_of_war&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Applicability to states and individuals")]

The law of war is binding not only upon states as such but also upon individuals and, in particular, the members of their [armed forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_forces "Armed forces"). Parties are bound by the laws of war to the extent that such compliance does not interfere with achieving legitimate military goals. For example, they are obliged to make every effort to avoid damaging people and property not involved in [combat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat "Combat") or the [war effort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_effort "War effort"), but they are not guilty of a war crime if a bomb mistakenly or incidentally hits a residential area.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

By the same token, combatants that _intentionally_ use protected people or property as [human shields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_shields "Human shields") or [camouflage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camouflage "Camouflage") are guilty of violations of the laws of war and are responsible for damage to those that should be protected.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_armed_conflict#cite_note-auto-31)

The use of [contracted combatants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_military_contractors "Private military contractors") in warfare has been an especially tricky situation for the laws of war. Some scholars claim that private security contractors appear so similar to state forces that it is unclear if acts of war are taking place by private or public agents.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_armed_conflict#cite_note-32)[International law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law "International law") has yet to come to a consensus on this issue.

Remedies for violations
-----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Law_of_war&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Remedies for violations")]

During conflict, [punishment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punishment "Punishment") for violating the laws of war may consist of a specific, deliberate and limited violation of the laws of war in [reprisal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reprisal "Reprisal").[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

After a conflict ends, any persons who have committed or ordered any breach of the laws of war, especially atrocities, may be held individually accountable for [war crimes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crimes "War crimes"). Also, nations that signed the Geneva Conventions are required to search for, try and punish, anyone who had committed or ordered certain "grave breaches" of the laws of war. ([Third Geneva Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Geneva_Convention "Third Geneva Convention"), Article 129 and Article 130.)

Combatants who break specific provisions of the laws of war are termed [unlawful combatants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unlawful_combatants "Unlawful combatants"). Unlawful combatants who have been captured may lose the status and protections that would otherwise be afforded to them as [prisoners of war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoners_of_war "Prisoners of war"), but only after a "[competent tribunal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competent_tribunal "Competent tribunal")" has determined that they are not eligible for POW status (e.g., Third Geneva Convention, Article 5.) At that point, an unlawful combatant may be interrogated, tried, imprisoned, and even executed for their violation of the laws of war pursuant to the domestic law of their captor, but they are still entitled to certain additional protections, including that they be "treated with humanity and, in case of trial, shall not be deprived of the [rights of fair and regular trial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_a_fair_trial "Right to a fair trial")." ([Fourth Geneva Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Geneva_Convention "Fourth Geneva Convention") Article 5.)
