The individual must have either studied at the university (although they may not necessarily have taken a degree), or worked at the university in an academic capacity; others have held fellowships at one of the university's colleges .

Honorary fellows or those awarded an honorary degree are not included and neither are non-executive chancellors . Lecturers without long-term posts at the university also do not feature, although official visiting fellows and visiting professors do.

The list has been divided into categories indicating the field of activity in which people have become well known. Many of the university's alumni/ae have attained a level of distinction in more than one field. These individuals may appear under two categories. In general, however, an attempt has been made to put individuals in the category with which they are most associated.

Cantabrigians is a term for members of the university derived from its Latin name Cantabrigia , a medieval Latin name for Cambridge.

This is a dynamic list and may never be able to satisfy particular standards for completeness. You can help by adding missing items with reliable sources .
