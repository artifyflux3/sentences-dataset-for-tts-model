For limits of probability distributions, see Convergence of random variables § Convergence in distribution .

In mathematics , specifically in the theory of generalized functions , the limit of a sequence of distributions is the distribution that sequence approaches. The distance, suitably quantified, to the limiting distribution can be made arbitrarily small by selecting a distribution sufficiently far along the sequence. This notion generalizes a limit of a sequence of functions ; a limit as a distribution may exist when a limit of functions does not.

The notion is a part of distributional calculus, a generalized form of calculus that is based on the notion of distributions, as opposed to classical calculus, which is based on the narrower concept of functions .

Definition [ edit ] Given a sequence of distributions f i {\displaystyle f_{i}} , its limit f {\displaystyle f} is the distribution given by f [ φ φ ] = lim i → → ∞ ∞ f i [ φ φ ] {\displaystyle f[\varphi ]=\lim _{i\to \infty }f_{i}[\varphi ]} for each test function φ φ {\displaystyle \varphi } , provided that distribution exists. The existence of the limit f {\displaystyle f} means that (1) for each φ φ {\displaystyle \varphi } , the limit of the sequence of numbers f i [ φ φ ] {\displaystyle f_{i}[\varphi ]} exists and that (2) the linear functional f {\displaystyle f} defined by the above formula is continuous with respect to the topology on the space of test functions.

More generally, as with functions, one can also consider a limit of a family of distributions.

Examples [ edit ] A distributional limit may still exist when the classical limit does not. Consider, for example, the function: f t ( x ) = t 1 + t 2 x 2 {\displaystyle f_{t}(x)={t \over 1+t^{2}x^{2}}} Since, by integration by parts , ⟨ ⟨ f t , ϕ ϕ ⟩ ⟩ = − − ∫ ∫ − − ∞ ∞ 0 arctan ⁡ ⁡ ( t x ) ϕ ϕ ′ ( x ) d x − − ∫ ∫ 0 ∞ ∞ arctan ⁡ ⁡ ( t x ) ϕ ϕ ′ ( x ) d x , {\displaystyle \langle f_{t},\phi \rangle =-\int _{-\infty }^{0}\arctan(tx)\phi '(x)\,dx-\int _{0}^{\infty }\arctan(tx)\phi '(x)\,dx,} we have: lim t → → ∞ ∞ ⟨ ⟨ f t , ϕ ϕ ⟩ ⟩ = ⟨ ⟨ π π δ δ 0 , ϕ ϕ ⟩ ⟩ {\displaystyle \displaystyle \lim _{t\to \infty }\langle f_{t},\phi \rangle =\langle \pi \delta _{0},\phi \rangle } . That is, the limit of f t {\displaystyle f_{t}} as t → → ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle t\to \infty } is π π δ δ 0 {\displaystyle \pi \delta _{0}} .

Let f ( x + i 0 ) {\displaystyle f(x+i0)} denote the distributional limit of f ( x + i y ) {\displaystyle f(x+iy)} as y → → 0 + {\displaystyle y\to 0^{+}} , if it exists. The distribution f ( x − − i 0 ) {\displaystyle f(x-i0)} is defined similarly.

One has ( x − − i 0 ) − − 1 − − ( x + i 0 ) − − 1 = 2 π π i δ δ 0 .

{\displaystyle (x-i0)^{-1}-(x+i0)^{-1}=2\pi i\delta _{0}.} Let Γ Γ N = [ − − N − − 1 / 2 , N + 1 / 2 ] 2 {\displaystyle \Gamma _{N}=[-N-1/2,N+1/2]^{2}} be the rectangle with positive orientation, with an integer N . By the residue formula , I N = d e f ∫ ∫ Γ Γ N ϕ ϕ ^ ^ ( z ) π π cot ⁡ ⁡ ( π π z ) d z = 2 π π i ∑ ∑ − − N N ϕ ϕ ^ ^ ( n ) .

{\displaystyle I_{N}{\overset {\mathrm {def} }{=}}\int _{\Gamma _{N}}{\widehat {\phi }}(z)\pi \cot(\pi z)\,dz={2\pi i}\sum _{-N}^{N}{\widehat {\phi }}(n).} On the other hand, ∫ ∫ − − R R ϕ ϕ ^ ^ ( ξ ξ ) π π cot ⁡ ⁡ ( π π ξ ξ ) d = ∫ ∫ − − R R ∫ ∫ 0 ∞ ∞ ϕ ϕ ( x ) e − − 2 π π I x ξ ξ d x d ξ ξ + ∫ ∫ − − R R ∫ ∫ − − ∞ ∞ 0 ϕ ϕ ( x ) e − − 2 π π I x ξ ξ d x d ξ ξ = ⟨ ⟨ ϕ ϕ , cot ⁡ ⁡ ( ⋅ ⋅ − − i 0 ) − − cot ⁡ ⁡ ( ⋅ ⋅ − − i 0 ) ⟩ ⟩ {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\int _{-R}^{R}{\widehat {\phi }}(\xi )\pi \operatorname {cot} (\pi \xi )\,d&=\int _{-R}^{R}\int _{0}^{\infty }\phi (x)e^{-2\pi Ix\xi }\,dx\,d\xi +\int _{-R}^{R}\int _{-\infty }^{0}\phi (x)e^{-2\pi Ix\xi }\,dx\,d\xi \\&=\langle \phi ,\cot(\cdot -i0)-\cot(\cdot -i0)\rangle \end{aligned}}} Oscillatory integral [ edit ] Main article: Oscillatory integral See also [ edit ] Distribution (number theory) References [ edit ] Demailly, Complex Analytic and Differential Geometry Hörmander , Lars, The Analysis of Linear Partial Differential Operators , Springer-Verlag This mathematical analysis –related article is a stub .
