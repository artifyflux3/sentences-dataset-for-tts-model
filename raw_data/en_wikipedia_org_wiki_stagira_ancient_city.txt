It is chiefly known for being the birthplace of Aristotle , the Greek philosopher and polymath, student of Plato , and teacher of Alexander the Great . The ruins of the city lie approximately 18 kilometres (11 mi) northeast of the present-day village of Stagira , and adjacent to the town of Olympiada .

History [ edit ] Stagira was founded in 655 BC by Ionian settlers from Andros .

[ 1 ] Xerxes I of Persia occupied it in 480 BC. The city later joined the Delian League , led by Athens , but left in 424 BC: as a result, the Athenian demagogue Cleon laid siege to it in 422 BC. However, Cleon was a poor strategist and his conduct of the siege was very inefficient: so much so that the ancient Greek comedy writer Aristophanes satirised him in the play The Knights .

[ 2 ] Cleon died in the same year, in the battle of Amphipolis . Later, during the Peloponnesian War , Stagira sided with Sparta against the Athenians .

[ 1 ] In 348 BC, Philip II of Macedon occupied and destroyed the city.

[ 1 ] In return for Aristotle's tutoring of his son Alexander , Philip later rebuilt the city and resettled the old city's inhabitants.

[ 3 ] Many new structures were built at this time, including an aqueduct , two shrines to Demeter , and many houses.

Tradition has it that the natives of Stageira transferred Aristotle's relics to the city, buried it there, and founded a festival in his honour which was called "Aristoteleia".

[ 1 ] Much later, the Danish archaeologist Karl Frederik Kinch made several explorations of Chalkidiki in 1886, and he identified the site of Stagira based on ancient descriptions of it.
