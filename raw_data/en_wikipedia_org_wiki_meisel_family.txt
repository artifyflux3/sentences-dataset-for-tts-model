The Meisel family (also Meisels and Meizels ) is a distinguished Bohemian rabbinic family originally from Prague , who descend from Yitskhak Eizik Meisels (b. 1425), a paternal 10th generation descendant of the Exilarch , Mar Ukba .

[ 1 ] From the early 16th century and onward, members of the family such as Mordecai Meisel achieved great economic prominence in Prague , becoming one of the wealthiest Bohemian Jewish families. It was also during this time that a branch of the family descending from Simcha Bunim Meisels (1545-1624) (the son-in-law of Moses Isserles ) immigrated to Kraków , Poland due to rising Antisemitism in Bohemia. In Poland the family produced several rabbinic scholars, such as Dow Ber Meisels and Moses Bonems-Meisels .

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] Among the families descendants are: Shabbatai HaKohen , Yitzchak Yaacov Reines , Alexander Sender Shor , John von Neumann , [ 4 ] as well as the Peshischa , Sulitza , Ropshitz , Bobov , Biala , Kretshnif , and Kotzk Hasidic dynasties .
