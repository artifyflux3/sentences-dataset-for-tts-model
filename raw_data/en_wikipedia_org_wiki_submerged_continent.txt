Find sources: "Submerged continent" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( August 2015 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Topographic map of Zealandia A submerged continent or a sunken continent is a region of continental crust , extensive in size but mainly undersea . The terminology is used by some paleogeologists and geographers in reference to some landmasses (none of which are as large as any of the seven generally-recognized continents ).

The definition of this term is unclear. If continental fragments and microcontinents smaller than 2,500,000 km 2 (970,000 sq mi), which is approximately one third of the area of mainland Australia , are excluded, then Zealandia (approximately 4,900,000 km 2 or 1,900,000 sq mi) would be the only geological feature which is classifiable as a submerged continent.

Other notable submerged lands include Beringia , Doggerland , the Kerguelen Plateau , Mauritia , Sahul , and Sunda .

Submerged continents have been sought and speculated about in regard to a possible " lost continent " underwater in the Atlantic Ocean .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] There was also a search in the 1930s for Lemuria , thought to have been a possible submerged continent between the Indian and African coasts.
