References [ edit ] ^ It is often mistakenly claimed that Brentano was called Ludwig Joseph, and that "Lujo" was a kind of nickname or contraction. This is incorrect; while he was given his name after a Ludwig and a Joseph , Lujo was his real and legal first name . (See his autobiography, Mein Leben im Kampf um die soziale Entwicklung Deutschlands , p. 18.) ^ Lujo Brentano was the son of the writer Christian Brentano , nephew of writers Clemens Brentano and Bettina von Arnim , two major figures in the romantic movement in German literature, and the brother of Franz Brentano , a philosopher whose students included Edmund Husserl , Alexius Meinong and Sigmund Freud , among others.
