Yang Hui's construction of 3rd order magic square

**Yang Hui** ([simplified Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_Chinese_characters "Simplified Chinese characters"): 杨辉; [traditional Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters "Traditional Chinese characters"): 楊輝; [pinyin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin "Pinyin"): _Yáng Huī_, ca. 1238–1298), [courtesy name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courtesy_name "Courtesy name")**Qianguang** (謙光), was a Chinese mathematician and writer during the [Song dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song_dynasty "Song dynasty"). Originally, from Qiantang (modern [Hangzhou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangzhou "Hangzhou"), [Zhejiang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhejiang "Zhejiang")), Yang worked on [magic squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_square "Magic square"), [magic circles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_circle_(mathematics) "Magic circle (mathematics)") and the [binomial theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_theorem "Binomial theorem"), and is best known for his contribution of presenting [Yang Hui's triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang_Hui%27s_triangle "Yang Hui's triangle"). This triangle was the same as [Pascal's triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_triangle "Pascal's triangle"), discovered by Yang's predecessor [Jia Xian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jia_Xian "Jia Xian"). Yang was also a contemporary of [Qin Jiushao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qin_Jiushao "Qin Jiushao"), another well-known Chinese mathematician.

The earliest extant Chinese illustration of '[Pascal's triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_triangle "Pascal's triangle")' is from Yang's book _Xiángjiě Jiǔzhāng Suànfǎ_ (詳解九章算法)[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang_Hui#cite_note-1) of 1261 AD, in which Yang acknowledged that his method of finding square roots and cubic roots using "Yang Hui's triangle" was invented by mathematician [Jia Xian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jia_Xian "Jia Xian")[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang_Hui#cite_note-needham_volume_3_134_137-2) who expounded it around 1100 AD, about 500 years before Pascal. His book (now lost), known as _Rújī Shìsuǒ_ (如積釋鎖) or _Piling-up Powers and Unlocking Coefficients_, was known through his contemporary mathematician [Liu Ruxie](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Liu_Ruxie&action=edit&redlink=1 "Liu Ruxie (page does not exist)") (劉汝諧).[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang_Hui#cite_note-needham_volume_3_137-3) Jia described the method used as 'li cheng shi suo' (the tabulation system for unlocking binomial coefficients).[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang_Hui#cite_note-needham_volume_3_137-3) It appeared again in a publication of [Zhu Shijie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhu_Shijie "Zhu Shijie")'s book _Jade Mirror of the Four Unknowns_ (四元玉鑒) of 1303 AD.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang_Hui#cite_note-needham_volume_3_134_135-4)

Around 1275 AD, Yang finally had two published mathematical books, which were known as the _Xùgǔ Zhāijī Suànfǎ_ (續古摘奇算法) and the _Suànfǎ Tōngbiàn Běnmò_ (算法通變本末, summarily called _Yáng Huī Suànfǎ_ 楊輝算法).[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang_Hui#cite_note-needham_volume_3_104-5) In the former book, Yang wrote of arrangement of natural numbers around concentric and non-concentric circles, known as [magic circles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_circle_(mathematics) "Magic circle (mathematics)") and vertical-horizontal [diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagram "Diagram") of complex [combinatorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial "Combinatorial") arrangements known as [magic squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_squares "Magic squares"), providing rules for their construction.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang_Hui#cite_note-needham_volume_3_59_60-6) In his writing, he harshly criticized the earlier works of [Li Chunfeng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Chunfeng "Li Chunfeng") and [Liu Yi](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Liu_Yi_(mathematician)&action=edit&redlink=1 "Liu Yi (mathematician) (page does not exist)") (劉益), the latter of whom were both content with using methods without working out their theoretical origins or principle.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang_Hui#cite_note-needham_volume_3_104-5) Displaying a somewhat modern attitude and approach to [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), Yang once said:

_The men of old changed the name of their methods from problem to problem, so that as no specific explanation was given, there is no way of telling their theoretical origin or basis._[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang_Hui#cite_note-needham_volume_3_104-5)
In his written work, Yang provided theoretical proof for the proposition that the complements of the [parallelograms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallelogram "Parallelogram") which are about the diameter of any given parallelogram are equal to one another.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang_Hui#cite_note-needham_volume_3_104-5) This was the same idea expressed in the Greek mathematician [Euclid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid "Euclid")'s (fl. 300 BC) forty-third proposition of his first book, only Yang used the case of a rectangle and [gnomon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnomon "Gnomon").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang_Hui#cite_note-needham_volume_3_104-5) There were also a number of other geometrical problems and theoretical mathematical propositions posed by Yang that were strikingly similar to the Euclidean system.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang_Hui#cite_note-needham_volume_3_105-7) However, the first books of Euclid to be translated into Chinese was by the cooperative effort of the Italian Jesuit [Matteo Ricci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matteo_Ricci "Matteo Ricci") and the [Ming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ming_dynasty "Ming dynasty") official [Xu Guangqi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xu_Guangqi "Xu Guangqi") in the early 17th century.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang_Hui#cite_note-needham_volume_3_106-8)

Yang's writing represents the first in which [quadratic equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_equation "Quadratic equation") with negative coefficients of 'x' appear, although he attributes this to the earlier Liu Yi.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang_Hui#cite_note-needham_volume_3_46-9) Yang was also well known for his ability to manipulate decimal fractions. When he wished to multiply the figures in a rectangular field with a breadth of 24 paces 3 4⁄10 ft. and length of 36 paces 2 8⁄10, Yang expressed them in decimal parts of the pace, as 24.68 X 36.56 = 902.3008.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang_Hui#cite_note-needham_volume_3_45-10)

The Yang-Hui Award is presented to mathematicians or scientists who have gained international recognition for their exceptional contributions throughout their careers.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang_Hui#cite_note-11) It was awarded to Salvatore Capozziello for his work with [Noether symmetries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noether%27s_theorem "Noether's theorem"); [Mahouton Norbert Hounkonnou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahouton_Norbert_Hounkonnou "Mahouton Norbert Hounkonnou") for his work in deformed quantum algebras; and to Delfim F. M. Torres for his mathematical modelling of [COVID-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19 "COVID-19") in 2023 at the International Conference on Mathematical Analysis, Applications and Computational Simulation (ICMAACS 2023), Shanghai, China, November 22-26, 2023.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang_Hui#cite_note-12)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang_Hui#cite_note-13)
