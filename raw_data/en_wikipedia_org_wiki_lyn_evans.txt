[ 1 ] Based at CERN , in 2012 he became the director of the Linear Collider Collaboration, an international organisation managing development of next generation particle colliders, including the International Linear Collider and the Compact Linear Collider .

[ 2 ] Biography [ edit ] Born and raised in Cwmbach near Aberdare in the South Wales Valleys , Evans had an interest in chemistry in his youth, initially enrolling in university to study the subject before switching to physics because he found the subject easier.

[ 3 ] Evans was educated at Aberdare Boys' Grammar School , where he developed an interest in physics. However, he found it difficult to pass his O Level in French, a qualification which was required to allow him to enter his course at the University College of Swansea (now Swansea University ), from where he graduated in 1970.

[ 4 ] He switched to physics in his second year of undergraduate study at Swansea.

[ 3 ] He went to CERN initially as a research fellow, having previously visited the establishment in 1969 as a visitor.

[ 3 ] In 1994, [ 5 ] he became involved in the planning of the project which would become the Large Hadron Collider. He served as the LHC project leader until 2008.

[ 6 ] In 2011 at the international symposium on subnuclear physics held in Vatican City, he gave a talk The Proton Beam for the Neutrino Velocity Measurement with OPERA .

[ 7 ] In June 2012, the International Committee for Future Accelerators selected Evans as Director of the Linear Collider Collaboration, an international effort promoting construction of a new linear collider to complement CERN's Large Hadron Collider.

[ 2 ] Awards and honours [ edit ] Evans has been a Fellow of the American Physical Society since 1991.

[ 8 ] He was appointed CBE in the 2001 New Year Honours .

He was made an honorary fellow of the University of Wales Swansea in 2002.

[ 9 ] He was awarded an honorary Doctor of Science from the University of Glamorgan (now University of South Wales ) in July 2010.

[ 10 ] In 2010, Evans was also elected a Fellow of the Royal Society .

[ 11 ] In 2011, Evans was elected a Fellow of the Learned Society of Wales .

[ 12 ] On 11 December 2012, he was awarded the 2012 Special Fundamental Physics Prize . He was cited, "For his leadership role in the scientific endeavour that led to the discovery of the new Higgs-like particle by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations at CERN's Large Hadron Collider".

[ 13 ] The Institute of Physics awarded him the Glazebrook Medal in 2013, citing him "for his leadership of the Large Hadron Collider Project".

[ 14 ] He received the 2013 Special Breakthrough Prize, "For his leadership role in the scientific endeavour that led to the discovery of the new Higgs-like particle by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations at CERN's Large Hadron Collider".

[ 15 ] He received the IEEE Simon Ramo Medal in 2014, for exceptional achievement in systems engineering and systems science , "For systems leadership of the Large Hadron Collider Project from conceptual design through completion of construction".

[ 16 ] He received the Rolf Widerøe Prize in 2017 [ 17 ] References [ edit ] ^ Krause, Michael (2014). "The Man Who Built the LHC: Lyn Evans".
