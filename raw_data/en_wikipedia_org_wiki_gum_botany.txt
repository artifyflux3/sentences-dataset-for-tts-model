Gum arabic exuded from a wound in the trunk of Vachellia nilotica Gum is a sap or other resinous material associated with certain species of the plant kingdom . This material is often polysaccharide -based and is most frequently associated with woody plants , particularly under the bark or as a seed coating. The polysaccharide material is typically of high molecular weight and most often highly hydrophilic [ 1 ] or hydrocolloidal .

As seed coating [ edit ] Many gums occur as seed coatings for plant species; the adaptive purpose of some of these gummy coatings is to delay germination of certain flora seeds. An example of such a gummy coating occurs in the case of Western poison oak , a widespread shrub in western North America.
