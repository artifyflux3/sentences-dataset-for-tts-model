The first use of an equals sign, equivalent to 14 _x_ + 15 = 71 in modern notation. From _[The Whetstone of Witte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Whetstone\_of\_Witte "The Whetstone of Witte")_ by [Robert Recorde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Recorde "Robert Recorde") of Wales (1557).[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation#cite_note-Whetstone-1)

In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), an **equation** is a [mathematical formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_formula "Mathematical formula") that expresses the [equality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equality_(mathematics) "Equality (mathematics)") of two [expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_(mathematics) "Expression (mathematics)"), by connecting them with the [equals sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equals_sign "Equals sign")=.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation#cite_note-:1-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation#cite_note-3) The word _equation_ and its [cognates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognate "Cognate") in other languages may have subtly different meanings; for example, in [French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language "French language") an _équation_ is defined as containing one or more [variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics) "Variable (mathematics)"), while in [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language "English language"), any [well-formed formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-formed_formula "Well-formed formula") consisting of two expressions related with an equals sign is an equation.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation#cite_note-4)

[Solving an equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_solving "Equation solving") containing variables consists of determining which values of the variables make the equality true. The variables for which the equation has to be solved are also called **unknowns**, and the values of the unknowns that satisfy the equality are called [solutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution_(equation) "Solution (equation)") of the equation. There are two kinds of equations: [identities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_(mathematics) "Identity (mathematics)") and conditional equations. An identity is true for all values of the variables. A conditional equation is only true for particular values of the variables.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation#cite_note-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation#cite_note-6)

The "[=](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%3D "=")" symbol, which appears in every equation, was invented in 1557 by [Robert Recorde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Recorde "Robert Recorde"), who considered that nothing could be more equal than parallel straight lines with the same length.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation#cite_note-Whetstone-1)

An equation is written as two [expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_(mathematics) "Expression (mathematics)"), connected by an [equals sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equals_sign "Equals sign") ("=").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation#cite_note-:1-2) The expressions on the two [sides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sides_of_an_equation "Sides of an equation") of the equals sign are called the "left-hand side" and "right-hand side" of the equation. Very often the right-hand side of an equation is assumed to be zero. This does not reduce the generality, as this can be realized by subtracting the right-hand side from both sides.

The most common type of equation is a [polynomial equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_equation "Polynomial equation") (commonly called also an _algebraic equation_) in which the two sides are [polynomials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial "Polynomial"). The sides of a polynomial equation contain one or more [terms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#Notation_and_terminology "Addition"). For example, the equation

![Image 2: {\displaystyle Ax^{2}+Bx+C-y=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/48f35a43975baf07af45c8768074725fdcddb7aa)
has left-hand side ![Image 3: {\displaystyle Ax^{2}+Bx+C-y}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/dba4508f349e30d6fe1032237df53d03b7d5953e), which has four terms, and right-hand side ![Image 4: {\displaystyle 0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2aae8864a3c1fec9585261791a809ddec1489950), consisting of just one term. The names of the [variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics) "Variable (mathematics)") suggest that _x_ and _y_ are unknowns, and that _A_, _B_, and _C_ are [parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter "Parameter"), but this is normally fixed by the context (in some contexts, y may be a parameter, or _A_, _B_, and _C_ may be ordinary variables).

An equation is analogous to a scale into which weights are placed. When equal weights of something (e.g., grain) are placed into the two pans, the two weights cause the scale to be in balance and are said to be equal. If a quantity of grain is removed from one pan of the balance, an equal amount must be removed from the other pan to keep the scale in balance. More generally, an equation remains balanced if the same operation is performed on each side.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation#cite_note-7)

Two equations or two systems of equations are _equivalent_, if they have the same set of solutions. The following operations transform an equation or a system of equations into an equivalent one – provided that the operations are meaningful for the expressions they are applied to:

*   [Adding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition "Addition") or [subtracting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtraction "Subtraction") the same quantity to both sides of an equation. This shows that every equation is equivalent to an equation in which the right-hand side is zero.
*   [Multiplying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication "Multiplication") or [dividing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_(mathematics) "Division (mathematics)") both sides of an equation by a non-zero quantity.
*   Applying an [identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_(mathematics) "Identity (mathematics)") to transform one side of the equation. For example, [expanding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_expansion "Polynomial expansion") a product or [factoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorization_of_polynomials "Factorization of polynomials") a sum.
*   For a system: adding to both sides of an equation the corresponding side of another equation, multiplied by the same quantity.

If some [function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics) "Function (mathematics)") is applied to both sides of an equation, the resulting equation has the solutions of the initial equation among its solutions, but may have further solutions called [extraneous solutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraneous_solution "Extraneous solution"). For example, the equation ![Image 5: {\displaystyle x=1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ee42176e76ae6b56d68c42ced807e08b962a2b54) has the solution ![Image 6: {\displaystyle x=1.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/45c68848dcaa8574feb04951e71070f80b77f752) Raising both sides to the exponent of 2 (which means applying the function ![Image 7: {\displaystyle f(s)=s^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/811ad531067d574222332295705ff8220cf70a78) to both sides of the equation) changes the equation to ![Image 8: {\displaystyle x^{2}=1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/51e28d7561fa4fe556f438b88380ef98c5631cf5), which not only has the previous solution but also introduces the extraneous solution, ![Image 9: {\displaystyle x=-1.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a51899e84bbbb14d044de1e69f57f73f70178b4c) Moreover, if the function is not defined at some values (such as 1/_x_, which is not defined for _x_ = 0), solutions existing at those values may be lost. Thus, caution must be exercised when applying such a transformation to an equation.

The above transformations are the basis of most elementary methods for [equation solving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_solving "Equation solving"), as well as some less elementary ones, like [Gaussian elimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_elimination "Gaussian elimination").

### Analogous illustration

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Equation&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Analogous illustration")]

[![Image 10](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Equation_illustration_colour.svg/250px-Equation_illustration_colour.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Equation_illustration_colour.svg)

Illustration of a simple equation; _x_, _y_, _z_ are real numbers, analogous to weights.

An equation is analogous to a [weighing scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighing_scale "Weighing scale"), balance, or [seesaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seesaw "Seesaw").

Each side of the equation corresponds to one side of the balance; to the left, and to the right. Different quantities can be placed on each side: if the weights on the two sides are equal, the scale balances, and in analogy, the equality that represents the balance is also balanced (if not, then the lack of balance corresponds to an [inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inequality_(mathematics) "Inequality (mathematics)") represented by an [inequation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inequation "Inequation")).

In the illustration, _x_, _y_ and _z_ are all different quantities (in this case [real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_numbers "Real numbers")) represented as circular weights, and each of _x_, _y_, and _z_ has a different weight. Addition corresponds to adding weight, while subtraction corresponds to removing weight from what is already there. When equality holds, the total weight on each side is the same.

### Parameters and unknowns

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Equation&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Parameters and unknowns")]

Equations often contain terms other than the unknowns. These other terms, which are assumed to be _known_, are usually called _constants_, _coefficients_ or _parameters_.

An example of an equation involving _x_ and _y_ as unknowns and the parameter _R_ is

![Image 11: {\displaystyle x^{2}+y^{2}=R^{2}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fe1f27078e621122772fdeb967fe85a71be259b5)
When _R_ is chosen to have the value of 2 (_R_= 2), this equation would be recognized in [Cartesian coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinates "Cartesian coordinates") as the equation for the circle of radius of 2 around the origin. Hence, the equation with _R_ unspecified is the general equation for the circle.

Usually, the unknowns are denoted by letters at the end of the alphabet, _x_, _y_, _z_, _w_, ..., while coefficients (parameters) are denoted by letters at the beginning, _a_, _b_, _c_, _d_, ... . For example, the general [quadratic equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_equation "Quadratic equation") is usually written _ax_ 2+_bx_+_c_=0.

The process of finding the solutions, or, in case of parameters, expressing the unknowns in terms of the parameters, is called [solving the equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_solving "Equation solving"). Such expressions of the solutions in terms of the parameters are also called _solutions_.

A [system of equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_equations "System of equations") is a set of _simultaneous equations_, usually in several unknowns for which the common solutions are sought. Thus, a _solution to the system_ is a set of values for each of the unknowns, which together form a solution to each equation in the system. For example, the system

![Image 12: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}3x+5y&=2\\5x+8y&=3\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/64d70f591a29304ca95853d2b2ddd15fe3b67b94)
has the unique solution _x_=−1, _y_=1.

An identity is an equation that is true for all possible values of the variable(s) it contains. Many identities are known in algebra and calculus. In the process of solving an equation, an identity is often used to simplify an equation, making it more easily solvable.

In algebra, an example of an identity is the [difference of two squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_of_two_squares "Difference of two squares"):

![Image 13: {\displaystyle x^{2}-y^{2}=(x+y)(x-y)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f6364fdb9e9d31860302d0d4dd231cc4f06e992c)
which is true for all _x_ and _y_.

[Trigonometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometry "Trigonometry") is an area where many identities exist; these are useful in manipulating or solving [trigonometric equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometric_equation "Trigonometric equation"). Two of many that involve the [sine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_function "Sine function") and [cosine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_function "Cosine function") functions are:

![Image 14: {\displaystyle \sin ^{2}(\theta )+\cos ^{2}(\theta )=1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/47f3203bca6dc55c36d94ee525c44dac9e1716f1)
and

![Image 15: {\displaystyle \sin(2\theta )=2\sin(\theta )\cos(\theta )}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/49b9120d4e69a660935b978d66f352fd2e645199)
which are both true for all values of _θ_.

For example, to solve for the value of _θ_ that satisfies the equation:

![Image 16: {\displaystyle 3\sin(\theta )\cos(\theta )=1\,,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ef5afc15255c1fbbb969663c81461fde3c67f197)
where _θ_ is limited to between 0 and 45 degrees, one may use the above identity for the product to give:

![Image 17: {\displaystyle {\frac {3}{2}}\sin(2\theta )=1\,,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d40af5eefb61021cfcf56a14ecc5407d8f2417e4)
yielding the following solution for _θ:_

![Image 18: {\displaystyle \theta ={\frac {1}{2}}\arcsin \left({\frac {2}{3}}\right)\approx 20.9^{\circ }.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d051c1ae231480e303ae4e8291dfe51173147613)
Since the sine function is a [periodic function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_function "Periodic function"), there are infinitely many solutions if there are no restrictions on _θ_. In this example, restricting _θ_ to be between 0 and 45 degrees would restrict the solution to only one number.

[Algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra "Algebra") studies two main families of equations: [polynomial equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_equations "Polynomial equations") and, among them, the special case of [linear equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_equations "Linear equations"). When there is only one variable, polynomial equations have the form _P_(_x_)=0, where _P_ is a [polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial "Polynomial"), and linear equations have the form _ax_+_b_=0, where _a_ and _b_ are [parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter#Mathematical_functions "Parameter"). To solve equations from either family, one uses algorithmic or geometric techniques that originate from [linear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra "Linear algebra") or [mathematical analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis "Mathematical analysis"). Algebra also studies [Diophantine equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diophantine_equations "Diophantine equations") where the coefficients and solutions are [integers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integers "Integers"). The techniques used are different and come from [number theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory "Number theory"). These equations are difficult in general; one often searches just to find the existence or absence of a solution, and, if they exist, to count the number of solutions.

### Polynomial equations

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Equation&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Polynomial equations")]

[![Image 19](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Polynomialdeg2.svg/250px-Polynomialdeg2.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Polynomialdeg2.svg)

The solutions –1 and 2 of the polynomial equation _x_ 2 – _x_ + 2 = 0 are the points where the [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_of_a_function "Graph of a function") of the [quadratic function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_function "Quadratic function")_y_ = _x_ 2 – _x_ + 2 cuts the x-axis.

In general, an _algebraic equation_ or [polynomial equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_equation "Polynomial equation") is an equation of the form

![Image 20: {\displaystyle P=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f6f743f37b37ce0c2ddc1db0fdca0e577c19f51d), or![Image 21: {\displaystyle P=Q}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2abc7e2c5a78e9e6cb7a2a907279953f9b4a3f52)[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation#cite_note-8)
where _P_ and _Q_ are [polynomials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial "Polynomial") with coefficients in some [field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics) "Field (mathematics)") (e.g., [rational numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_number "Rational number"), [real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number"), [complex numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number "Complex number")). An algebraic equation is _univariate_ if it involves only one [variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics) "Variable (mathematics)"). On the other hand, a polynomial equation may involve several variables, in which case it is called _multivariate_ (multiple variables, x, y, z, etc.).

For example,

![Image 22: {\displaystyle x^{5}-3x+1=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/698e1afb9a1d47e492390b6a5a4612ea0dfff0cc)
is a univariate algebraic (polynomial) equation with integer coefficients and

![Image 23: {\displaystyle y^{4}+{\frac {xy}{2}}={\frac {x^{3}}{3}}-xy^{2}+y^{2}-{\frac {1}{7}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b5e8a49bf6d100e7a8b65135f6faffd17e470ceb)
is a multivariate polynomial equation over the rational numbers.

Some polynomial equations with [rational coefficients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_number "Rational number") have a solution that is an [algebraic expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_expression "Algebraic expression"), with a finite number of operations involving just those coefficients (i.e., can be [solved algebraically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_solution "Algebraic solution")). This can be done for all such equations of [degree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_of_a_polynomial "Degree of a polynomial") one, two, three, or four; but equations of degree five or more cannot always be solved in this way, as the [Abel–Ruffini theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abel%E2%80%93Ruffini_theorem "Abel–Ruffini theorem") demonstrates.

A large amount of research has been devoted to compute efficiently accurate approximations of the [real](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number") or [complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number "Complex number") solutions of a univariate algebraic equation (see [Root finding of polynomials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_finding_of_polynomials "Root finding of polynomials")) and of the common solutions of several multivariate polynomial equations (see [System of polynomial equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_polynomial_equations "System of polynomial equations")).

### Systems of linear equations

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Equation&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Systems of linear equations")]

[![Image 24](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/%E4%B9%9D%E7%AB%A0%E7%AE%97%E8%A1%93.gif/250px-%E4%B9%9D%E7%AB%A0%E7%AE%97%E8%A1%93.gif)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:%E4%B9%9D%E7%AB%A0%E7%AE%97%E8%A1%93.gif)

[The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nine_Chapters_on_the_Mathematical_Art "The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art") is an anonymous 2nd-century Chinese book proposing a method of resolution for linear equations.

A [system of linear equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_linear_equations "System of linear equations") (or _linear system_) is a collection of [linear equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_equation "Linear equation") involving one or more [variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(math) "Variable (math)").[[b]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation#cite_note-9) For example,

![Image 25: {\displaystyle {\begin{alignedat}{7}3x&&\;+\;&&2y&&\;-\;&&z&&\;=\;&&1&\\2x&&\;-\;&&2y&&\;+\;&&4z&&\;=\;&&-2&\\-x&&\;+\;&&{\tfrac {1}{2}}y&&\;-\;&&z&&\;=\;&&0&\end{alignedat}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d691839a2b284331b58b0820654d32e101e26a03)
is a system of three equations in the three variables _x_, _y_, _z_. A **solution** to a linear system is an assignment of numbers to the variables such that all the equations are simultaneously satisfied. A [solution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_solving "Equation solving") to the system above is given by

![Image 26: {\displaystyle {\begin{alignedat}{2}x&\,=\,&1\\y&\,=\,&-2\\z&\,=\,&-2\end{alignedat}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4460866202afb67e822389a6b11a0b453c89c1c7)
since it makes all three equations valid. The word "_system_" indicates that the equations are to be considered collectively, rather than individually.

In mathematics, the theory of linear systems is a fundamental part of [linear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra "Linear algebra"), a subject which is used in many parts of modern mathematics. Computational [algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm "Algorithm") for finding the solutions are an important part of [numerical linear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_linear_algebra "Numerical linear algebra"), and play a prominent role in [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics"), [engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering "Engineering"), [chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry "Chemistry"), [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science"), and [economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics "Economics"). A [system of non-linear equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_system "Nonlinear system") can often be [approximated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximation "Approximation") by a linear system (see [linearization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linearization "Linearization")), a helpful technique when making a [mathematical model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model "Mathematical model") or [computer simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_simulation "Computer simulation") of a relatively complex system.

[![Image 27](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/FunLin_04.svg/250px-FunLin_04.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:FunLin_04.svg)

The blue and red line is the set of all points (_x_,_y_) such that _x_+_y_=5 and -_x_+2 _y_=4, respectively. Their [intersection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersection_(Euclidean_geometry) "Intersection (Euclidean geometry)") point, (2,3), satisfies both equations.

In [Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry "Euclidean geometry"), it is possible to associate a set of coordinates to each point in space, for example by an orthogonal grid. This method allows one to characterize geometric figures by equations. A plane in three-dimensional space can be expressed as the solution set of an equation of the form ![Image 28: {\displaystyle ax+by+cz+d=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/746e9e9c5e6a562485cbc5ed6a9375ec67bad26f), where ![Image 29: {\displaystyle a,b,c}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f13f068df656c1b1911ae9f81628c49a6181194d) and ![Image 30: {\displaystyle d}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e85ff03cbe0c7341af6b982e47e9f90d235c66ab) are real numbers and ![Image 31: {\displaystyle x,y,z}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bbeca34b28f569a407ef74a955d041df9f360268) are the unknowns that correspond to the coordinates of a point in the system given by the orthogonal grid. The values ![Image 32: {\displaystyle a,b,c}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f13f068df656c1b1911ae9f81628c49a6181194d) are the coordinates of a vector perpendicular to the plane defined by the equation. A line is expressed as the intersection of two planes, that is as the solution set of a single linear equation with values in ![Image 33: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e150115ab9f63023215109595b76686a1ff890fd) or as the solution set of two linear equations with values in ![Image 34: {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b00b2b4fd27c2cbffa02df568472f77b194a6db9)

A [conic section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conic_section "Conic section") is the intersection of a [cone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone "Cone") with equation ![Image 35: {\displaystyle x^{2}+y^{2}=z^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/24defb565dbcba7850e1bfb51176bcf574b4e56b) and a plane. In other words, in space, all conics are defined as the solution set of an equation of a plane and of the equation of a cone just given. This formalism allows one to determine the positions and the properties of the focuses of a conic.

The use of equations allows one to call on a large area of mathematics to solve geometric questions. The [Cartesian coordinate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate "Cartesian coordinate") system transforms a geometric problem into an analysis problem, once the figures are transformed into equations; thus the name [analytic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_geometry "Analytic geometry"). This point of view, outlined by [Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descartes "Descartes"), enriches and modifies the type of geometry conceived of by the ancient Greek mathematicians.

Currently, analytic geometry designates an active branch of mathematics. Although it still uses equations to characterize figures, it also uses other sophisticated techniques such as [functional analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_analysis "Functional analysis") and [linear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra "Linear algebra").

### Cartesian equations

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Equation&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Cartesian equations")]

[![Image 36](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/Cartesian-coordinate-system-with-circle.svg/250px-Cartesian-coordinate-system-with-circle.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cartesian-coordinate-system-with-circle.svg)

Cartesian coordinate system with a circle of radius 2 centered at the origin marked in red. The equation of a circle is (_x_ − _a_)2 + (_y_ − _b_)2 = _r_ 2 where _a_ and _b_ are the coordinates of the center (_a_, _b_) and _r_ is the radius.

In [Cartesian geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_geometry "Cartesian geometry"), equations are used to describe [geometric figures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_figures "Geometric figures"). As the equations that are considered, such as [implicit equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_equation "Implicit equation") or [parametric equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_equation "Parametric equation"), have infinitely many solutions, the objective is now different: instead of giving the solutions explicitly or counting them, which is impossible, one uses equations for studying properties of figures. This is the starting idea of [algebraic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry "Algebraic geometry"), an important area of mathematics.

One can use the same principle to specify the position of any point in three-[dimensional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension "Dimension")[space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(mathematics) "Space (mathematics)") by the use of three Cartesian coordinates, which are the signed distances to three mutually perpendicular planes (or, equivalently, by its perpendicular projection onto three mutually perpendicular lines).

The invention of Cartesian coordinates in the 17th century by [René Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes "René Descartes") revolutionized mathematics by providing the first systematic link between [Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry "Euclidean geometry") and [algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra "Algebra"). Using the Cartesian coordinate system, geometric shapes (such as [curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve "Curve")) can be described by Cartesian equations: algebraic equations involving the coordinates of the points lying on the shape. For example, a circle of radius 2 in a plane, centered on a particular point called the origin, may be described as the set of all points whose coordinates _x_ and _y_ satisfy the equation _x_ 2 + _y_ 2 = 4.

### Parametric equations

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Equation&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Parametric equations")]

A [parametric equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_equation "Parametric equation") for a [curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve "Curve") expresses the [coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinates "Coordinates") of the points of the curve as functions of a [variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics) "Variable (mathematics)"), called a [parameter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter "Parameter").[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation#cite_note-10)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation#cite_note-11) For example,

![Image 37: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}x&=\cos t\\y&=\sin t\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/627bb5a6d2b57174bd596f1fc7990592b8e6076b)
are parametric equations for the [unit circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_circle "Unit circle"), where _t_ is the parameter. Together, these equations are called a parametric representation of the curve.

The notion of _parametric equation_ has been generalized to [surfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(topology) "Surface (topology)"), [manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold "Manifold") and [algebraic varieties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_variety "Algebraic variety") of higher [dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension_of_a_manifold "Dimension of a manifold"), with the number of parameters being equal to the dimension of the manifold or variety, and the number of equations being equal to the dimension of the space in which the manifold or variety is considered (for curves the dimension is _one_ and _one_ parameter is used, for surfaces dimension _two_ and _two_ parameters, etc.).

### Diophantine equations

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Equation&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Diophantine equations")]

A Diophantine equation is a [polynomial equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_equation "Polynomial equation") in two or more unknowns for which only the [integer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer "Integer")[solutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_of_a_function#Polynomial_roots "Zero of a function") are sought (an integer solution is a solution such that all the unknowns take integer values). A linear Diophantine equation is an equation between two sums of [monomials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomials "Monomials") of [degree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_of_a_polynomial "Degree of a polynomial") zero or one. An example of linear Diophantine equation is _ax_ + _by_ = _c_ where _a_, _b_, and _c_ are constants. An exponential Diophantine equation is one for which exponents of the terms of the equation can be unknowns.

Diophantine problems have fewer equations than unknown variables and involve finding integers that work correctly for all equations. In more technical language, they define an [algebraic curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_curve "Algebraic curve"), [algebraic surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_surface "Algebraic surface"), or more general object, and ask about the [lattice points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_point "Lattice point") on it.

The word _Diophantine_ refers to the [Hellenistic mathematician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_mathematics#Hellenistic "Greek mathematics") of the 3rd century, [Diophantus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diophantus "Diophantus") of [Alexandria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria "Alexandria"), who made a study of such equations and was one of the first mathematicians to introduce [symbolism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_symbol "Mathematical symbol") into [algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra "Algebra"). The mathematical study of Diophantine problems that Diophantus initiated is now called Diophantine analysis.

### Algebraic and transcendental numbers

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Equation&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Algebraic and transcendental numbers")]

An [algebraic number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_number "Algebraic number") is a number that is a solution of a non-zero [polynomial equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_equation "Polynomial equation") in one variable with [rational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_number "Rational number") coefficients (or equivalently — by [clearing denominators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearing_denominators "Clearing denominators") — with [integer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer "Integer") coefficients). Numbers such as [π](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi "Pi") that are not algebraic are said to be [transcendental](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendental_number "Transcendental number"). [Almost all](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almost_all "Almost all")[real](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number") and [complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number "Complex number") numbers are transcendental.

[Algebraic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry "Algebraic geometry") is a branch of [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), classically studying solutions of [polynomial equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_equations "Polynomial equations"). Modern algebraic geometry is based on more abstract techniques of [abstract algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_algebra "Abstract algebra"), especially [commutative algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_algebra "Commutative algebra"), with the language and the problems of [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry").

The fundamental objects of study in algebraic geometry are [algebraic varieties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_variety "Algebraic variety"), which are geometric manifestations of [solutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution_set "Solution set") of [systems of polynomial equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_of_polynomial_equations "Systems of polynomial equations"). Examples of the most studied classes of algebraic varieties are: [plane algebraic curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_algebraic_curve "Plane algebraic curve"), which include [lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_(geometry) "Line (geometry)"), [circles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle "Circle"), [parabolas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabola "Parabola"), [ellipses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipse "Ellipse"), [hyperbolas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbola "Hyperbola"), [cubic curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_curve "Cubic curve") like [elliptic curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve "Elliptic curve") and quartic curves like [lemniscates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemniscate_of_Bernoulli "Lemniscate of Bernoulli"), and [Cassini ovals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini_oval "Cassini oval"). A point of the plane belongs to an algebraic curve if its coordinates satisfy a given polynomial equation. Basic questions involve the study of the points of special interest like the [singular points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_point_of_a_curve "Singular point of a curve"), the [inflection points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflection_point "Inflection point") and the [points at infinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_at_infinity "Point at infinity"). More advanced questions involve the [topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology "Topology") of the curve and relations between the curves given by different equations.

Differential equations
----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Equation&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Differential equations")]

[![Image 38](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/Attracteur_%C3%A9trange_de_Lorenz.png/250px-Attracteur_%C3%A9trange_de_Lorenz.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Attracteur_%C3%A9trange_de_Lorenz.png)

A [strange attractor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_attractor "Strange attractor"), which arises when solving a certain [differential equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation "Differential equation")

A [differential equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation "Differential equation") is a [mathematical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics") equation that relates some [function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics) "Function (mathematics)") with its [derivatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative "Derivative"). In applications, the functions usually represent physical quantities, the derivatives represent their rates of change, and the equation defines a relationship between the two. They are solved by finding an expression for the function that does not involve derivatives. Differential equations are used to model processes that involve the rates of change of the variable, and are used in areas such as physics, chemistry, biology, and economics.

In [pure mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_mathematics "Pure mathematics"), differential equations are studied from several different perspectives, mostly concerned with their solutions — the set of functions that satisfy the equation. Only the simplest differential equations are solvable by explicit formulas; however, some properties of solutions of a given differential equation may be determined without finding their exact form.

If a self-contained formula for the solution is not available, the solution may be numerically approximated using computers. The theory of [dynamical systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_systems "Dynamical systems") puts emphasis on qualitative analysis of systems described by differential equations, while many [numerical methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_methods "Numerical methods") have been developed to determine solutions with a given degree of accuracy.

### Ordinary differential equations

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Equation&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: Ordinary differential equations")]

An [ordinary differential equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_differential_equation "Ordinary differential equation") or ODE is an equation containing a function of one [independent variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_variable "Independent variable") and its derivatives. The term "_ordinary_" is used in contrast with the term [partial differential equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation "Partial differential equation"), which may be with respect to _more than_ one independent variable.

Linear differential equations, which have solutions that can be added and multiplied by coefficients, are well-defined and understood, and exact closed-form solutions are obtained. By contrast, ODEs that lack additive solutions are nonlinear, and solving them is far more intricate, as one can rarely represent them by [elementary functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_functions "Elementary functions") in closed form: Instead, exact and analytic solutions of ODEs are in series or integral form. Graphical and [numerical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_ordinary_differential_equations "Numerical ordinary differential equations") methods, applied by hand or by computer, may approximate solutions of ODEs and perhaps yield useful information, often sufficing in the absence of exact, analytic solutions.

### Partial differential equations

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Equation&action=edit&section=20 "Edit section: Partial differential equations")]

A [partial differential equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation "Partial differential equation") (PDE) is a [differential equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation "Differential equation") that contains unknown [multivariable functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariable_calculus "Multivariable calculus") and their [partial derivatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_derivative "Partial derivative"). (This is in contrast to [ordinary differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_differential_equations "Ordinary differential equations"), which deal with functions of a single variable and their derivatives.) PDEs are used to formulate problems involving functions of several variables, and are either solved by hand, or used to create a relevant [computer model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_model "Computer model").

PDEs can be used to describe a wide variety of phenomena such as [sound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound "Sound"), [heat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat "Heat"), [electrostatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrostatics "Electrostatics"), [electrodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrodynamics "Electrodynamics"), [fluid flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_flow "Fluid flow"), [elasticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticity_(physics) "Elasticity (physics)"), or [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics"). These seemingly distinct physical phenomena can be formalised similarly in terms of PDEs. Just as ordinary differential equations often model one-dimensional [dynamical systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_systems "Dynamical systems"), partial differential equations often model [multidimensional systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidimensional_systems "Multidimensional systems"). PDEs find their generalisation in [stochastic partial differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_partial_differential_equations "Stochastic partial differential equations").

Equations can be classified according to the types of [operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_(mathematics) "Operation (mathematics)") and quantities involved. Important types include:

*   An [algebraic equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_equation "Algebraic equation") or [polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial "Polynomial") equation is an equation in which both sides are polynomials (see also [system of polynomial equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_polynomial_equations "System of polynomial equations")). These are further classified by [degree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_of_a_polynomial "Degree of a polynomial"): 
    *   [linear equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_equation "Linear equation") for degree one
    *   [quadratic equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_equation "Quadratic equation") for degree two
    *   [cubic equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_equation "Cubic equation") for degree three
    *   [quartic equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartic_equation "Quartic equation") for degree four
    *   [quintic equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quintic_equation "Quintic equation") for degree five
    *   [sextic equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sextic_equation "Sextic equation") for degree six
    *   [septic equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septic_equation "Septic equation") for degree seven
    *   [octic equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octic_equation "Octic equation") for degree eight

*   A [Diophantine equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diophantine_equation "Diophantine equation") is an equation where the unknowns are required to be [integers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer "Integer")
*   A [transcendental equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendental_equation "Transcendental equation") is an equation involving a [transcendental function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendental_function "Transcendental function") of its unknowns
*   A [parametric equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_equation "Parametric equation") is an equation in which the solutions for the variables are expressed as functions of some other variables, called [parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter "Parameter") appearing in the equations
*   A [functional equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_equation "Functional equation") is an equation in which the unknowns are [functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics) "Function (mathematics)") rather than simple quantities
*   Equations involving derivatives, integrals and finite differences: 
    *   A [differential equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation "Differential equation") is a functional equation involving [derivatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative "Derivative") of the unknown functions, where the function and its derivatives are evaluated at the same point, such as ![Image 39: {\displaystyle f'(x)=x^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bc93d64f68cd72d9f3cd1a4af2f8c6c8490cdeec). Differential equations are subdivided into [ordinary differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_differential_equation "Ordinary differential equation") for functions of a single variable and [partial differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation "Partial differential equation") for functions of multiple variables
    *   An [integral equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_equation "Integral equation") is a functional equation involving the [antiderivatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiderivative "Antiderivative") of the unknown functions. For functions of one variable, such an equation differs from a differential equation primarily through a change of variable substituting the function by its derivative, however this is not the case when the integral is taken over an open surface
    *   An [integro-differential equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integro-differential_equation "Integro-differential equation") is a functional equation involving both the [derivatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative "Derivative") and the [antiderivatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiderivative "Antiderivative") of the unknown functions. For functions of one variable, such an equation differs from integral and differential equations through a similar change of variable.
    *   A [functional differential equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_differential_equation "Functional differential equation") of [delay differential equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delay_differential_equation "Delay differential equation") is a function equation involving [derivatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative "Derivative") of the unknown functions, evaluated at multiple points, such as ![Image 40: {\displaystyle f'(x)=f(x-2)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/551d5554d0f762372d809cfeec19057805b4793c)
    *   A [difference equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_equation "Difference equation") is an equation where the unknown is a function _f_ that occurs in the equation through _f_(_x_), _f_(_x_−1), ..., _f_(_x_−_k_), for some whole integer _k_ called the _order_ of the equation. If _x_ is restricted to be an integer, a difference equation is the same as a [recurrence relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrence_relation "Recurrence relation")
    *   A [stochastic differential equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_differential_equation "Stochastic differential equation") is a differential equation in which one or more of the terms is a [stochastic process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_process "Stochastic process")
