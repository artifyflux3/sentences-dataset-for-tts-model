Halo nuclei form at the extreme edges of the table of nuclides — the neutron drip line and proton drip line — and have short half-lives, measured in milliseconds. These nuclei are studied shortly after their formation in an ion beam .

Typically, an atomic nucleus is a tightly bound group of protons and neutrons. However, in some nuclides, there is an overabundance of one species of nucleon. In some of these cases, a nuclear core and a halo will form.

Often, this property may be detected in scattering experiments, which show the nucleus to be much larger than the otherwise expected value. Normally, the cross-section (corresponding to the classical radius) of the nucleus is proportional to the cube root of its mass, as would be the case for a sphere of constant density. Specifically, for a nucleus of mass number A , the radius r is (approximately) r = r ∘ ∘ A 1 3 , {\displaystyle r=r_{\circ }A^{\frac {1}{3}},} where r ∘ ∘ {\displaystyle r_{\circ }} is 1.2 fm .

One example of a halo nucleus is 11 Li , which has a half-life of 8.6 ms. It contains a core of 3 protons and 6 neutrons, and a halo of two independent and loosely bound neutrons. It decays into 11 Be by the emission of an antineutrino and an electron.

[ 1 ] Its mass radius of 3.16 fm is close to that of 32 S or, even more impressively, of 208 Pb , both much heavier nuclei.

[ 2 ] Experimental confirmation of nuclear halos is recent and ongoing. Additional candidates are suspected. Several nuclides including 9 B, 13 N, and 15 N are calculated to have a halo in the excited state but not in the ground state .

A two-neutron halo is exhibited by 6 He , 11 Li , 17 B , 19 B and 22 C .

Two-neutron halo nuclei break into three fragments and are called Borromean because of this behavior, analogously to how all three of the Borromean rings are linked together but no two share a link. For example, the two-neutron halo nucleus 6 He (which can be taken as a three-body system consisting of an alpha particle and two neutrons) is bound, but neither 5 He nor the dineutron is.

8 He and 14 Be both exhibit a four-neutron halo.

Nuclei that have a proton halo include 8 B and 26 P . A two-proton halo is exhibited by 17 Ne and 27 S . Proton halos are expected to be rarer and more unstable than neutron halos because of the repulsive forces of the excess proton(s).

The measurements revealed that the average distance between the halo neutrons and the dense core of the [Be-11] nucleus is 7 femtometers. Thus, the halo neutron is about three times as far from the dense core as is the outermost proton, since the core itself has a radius of only 2.5 femtometers.
