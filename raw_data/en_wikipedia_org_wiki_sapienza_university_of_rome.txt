[ 8 ] It was founded in 1303 and is as such one of the world's oldest universities, [ 9 ] and with 122,000 students, it is the largest university in Europe .

[ 10 ] Due to its size, funding, and numerous laboratories and libraries, Sapienza is a global major education and research centre.

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] The university is located mainly in the Città Universitaria (University city), which covers 44 ha (110 acres) near the monumental cemetery Campo Verano , with different campuses, libraries and laboratories in various locations in Rome. For the 14th year in a row it is ranked 1st university in Italy and in Southern Europe according to CWUR . In 2025, Sapienza also confirmed its 1st position among universities in Italy and Southern Europe  for the fourth consecutive year in the Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU) [ 13 ] [ 14 ] .

Sapienza was founded on 20 April 1303 by decree from Pope Boniface VIII as a Studium for ecclesiastical studies under more control than the free-standing universities of Bologna and Padua . In 1431 Pope Eugene IV completely reorganized the studium and decreed that the university should expand to include the four schools of Law, Medicine, Philosophy, in addition to the existing Theology. In the 1650s the university became known as Sapienza , meaning "wisdom", a title it still retains.

[ 15 ] After the capture of Rome by the forces of the Kingdom of Italy in 1870, La Sapienza rapidly expanded as the chosen main university of the capital of the newly unified state. In 1935 the new university campus, planned by Marcello Piacentini , was completed.

[ 16 ] Sapienza teaches and conducts research in all pure and applied sciences and humanities. Sapienza houses 50 libraries with over 2.7 million books, most notably the Alessandrina University Library, built in 1667 by Pope Alexander VII , housing 1.5 million volumes.

[ 17 ] In addition it has 19 museums, a botanical garden, and three university hospitals.

[ 18 ] Sapienza's alumni includes 10 Nobel laureates , Italian prime ministers , one pope , Presidents of the European Parliament and European Commissioners , as well as several notable religious figures, supreme court judges, and astronauts.

( April 2016 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Palazzo della Sapienza , former home of the university until 1935 Church of Sant'Ivo alla Sapienza , originally the chapel and seat of the university library (until 1935) The Sapienza University of Rome was founded in 1303 with the Papal bull In Supremae praeminentia Dignitatis , issued on 20 April 1303 by Pope Boniface VIII , as a Studium for ecclesiastical studies more under his control than the universities of Bologna and Padua , [ 20 ] making it the first pontifical university.

[ 16 ] In 1431 Pope Eugene IV completely reorganized the studium with the bull In supremae , in which he granted masters and students alike the broadest possible privileges and decreed that the university should include the four schools of Law, Medicine, Philosophy and Theology. He introduced a new tax on wine to raise funds for the university; the money was used to buy a palace which later housed the Sant'Ivo alla Sapienza church.

However, the university's days of splendour came to an end during the sack of Rome in 1527, when the studium was closed, some of the professors were killed and others dispersed.

[ 21 ] Pope Paul III restored the university shortly after his election to the pontificate in 1534.

In the 1650s the university became known as Sapienza, meaning wisdom, a title it retains. In 1703, with his private funds, Pope Clement XI purchased some land on the Janiculum , where he created a botanical garden, which soon became the most celebrated in Europe through the labours of the Trionfetti brothers. The first complete history of the Sapienza University was written in 1803–1806 by Filippo Maria Renazzi .

[ 22 ] University students were newly animated during the 19th-century Italian revival. In 1870, La Sapienza stopped being the papal university and became the university of the capital of Italy. In 1935 the new university campus, planned by Marcello Piacentini , was completed.

On 15 January 2008 the Vatican cancelled a planned visit to La Sapienza University by Pope Benedict XVI who was to speak at the university ceremony launching the 2008 academic year [ 23 ] due to protests by some students and professors.

[ 24 ] The title of the speech would have been 'The Truth Makes Us Good and Goodness is Truth'.

[ 25 ] Some students and professors protested in reaction to a 1990 speech that Pope Benedict XVI (then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger) gave in which he, in their opinion, endorsed the actions of the church against Galileo in 1633.

[ 16 ] [ 23 ] Campuses [ edit ] The new campus of Rome University, built in 1935 by Marcello Piacentini , in a 1938 picture Entrance of "La Sapienza" University of Rome Sapienza University has many campuses in Rome, but its main campus is the Città Universitaria (University city), which covers 44 ha (110 acres) near the Roma Tiburtina Station . The university has satellite campuses outside Rome, the main one of which is in Latina .

In 2011 a project was launched to build a campus with residence halls near Pietralata station , in collaboration with the Lazio region.

[ 26 ] To cope with the ever-increasing number of applicants, the Rector also approved a new plan to expand the Città Universitaria , reallocate offices and enlarge faculties, as well as create new campuses for hosting local and foreign students.

The Alessandrina University Library [ 27 ] ( Biblioteca Universitaria Alessandrina ), built in 1667 by Pope Alexander VII , is the main library housing 1.5 million volumes; it has some important collections including collezione ciceroniana and Fondo Festa .

Points of interest [ edit ] Orto Botanico dell'Università di Roma "La Sapienza" , a botanical garden Sant'Ivo alla Sapienza San Pietro in Vincoli : the cloister is part of the Engineering School Villa Mirafiori: a Neo-Renaissance palace built during the 19th century, some rooms are decorated with fine frescoes. The Department of Philosophy is located in this building.

Academics [ edit ] Since the 2011 reform, Sapienza University of Rome has eleven faculties and 65 departments. Today Sapienza, with 140,000 students and 8,000 among academic and technical and administrative staff, is the largest university in Italy. The university has significant research programmes in the fields of engineering, natural sciences , biomedical sciences and humanities . It offers 10 Masters Programmes taught entirely in English.

[ citation needed ] Centro MedioEvA [ edit ] Sapienza University of Rome is one of the three institutions that, in 2022, contributed to the founding of the Centro MedioEvA . Founded by Donatella Manzoli (Sapienza University) and Elisabetta Bartoli (University of Siena), the Centre brings together a group of specialists in medieval literatures from the University of Siena , Sapienza University, and the University of Tours . This entirely new cultural initiative aims to promote, coordinate, and carry out research activities, projects, printed publications, and digital resources on literature composed in Latin and in the vernacular languages by women during the medieval millennium (6th–15th centuries).

Adopting a multidisciplinary and comparative approach, MedioEvA seeks to investigate women’s literatures and the cultural role of women within the medieval world, challenging deeply rooted yet anachronistic stereotypes. MedioEvA also aims to explore both the objective and subjective perceptions of women across the centuries of the Middle Ages , and—through the tools of philological and literary criticism —it fosters studies, critical editions, editions of unpublished works, and translations of texts that have either never been translated or are in need of new renderings.

MedioEvA also aspires to serve as a key platform for disseminating and promoting this little-known body of literature beyond the narrow circle of specialists, acting as a promoter of initiatives that seek to convey an updated understanding of the cultural role of medieval women and of the Middle Ages as a whole (such as student outreach, teacher training, and participation in cultural festivals). Knowledge of women’s literatures will enrich the contours of the Middle Ages, which forms the recognised foundation of our present.

[ 28 ] Among the scholarly works supported by the Centro MedioEvA, two notable examples are the volumes Scrittrici del Medioevo. Un'antologia [ 29 ] and Genere e generi. Scritture di donne nell'Europa medievale [ 30 ] .

[ 48 ] Admission [ edit ] To cope with the large demand for admission to the university courses, some faculties hold a series of entrance examinations. The entrance test often decides which candidates will have access to the undergraduate course. For some faculties, the entrance test is only a means through which the administration acknowledges the students' level of preparation. Students that do not pass the test can still enroll in their chosen degree courses but have to pass an additional exam during their first year.
