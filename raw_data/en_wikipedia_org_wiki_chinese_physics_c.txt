CPC is hosted online by IOP Publishing . It reports on research into the theory, experiment and applications of particle physics, nuclear physics and astrophysics. The journal was established in 1977 as High Energy Physics and Nuclear Physics , and renamed to its present title in 2008. Its current impact factor is 3.6 (2023).

Chinese Physics C is part of the SCOAP3 initiative.

In 2014 and 2016, the journal hosted the publication of the Particle Data Group 's bi-annual Review of Particle Physics , the most highly cited article in the field of particle physics .
