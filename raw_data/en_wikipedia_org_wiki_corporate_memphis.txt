Widely associated with Big Tech illustrations in the late 2010s [ 1 ] and early 2020s, [ 2 ] it has been met with a polarized response, with criticism focusing on its use in sanitizing corporate communication, [ 1 ] as well as being seen as visually offensive, insincere, pandering and over-saturated. Other illustrators have defended the style, pointing at what they claim to be its art-historical legitimacy.

[ 3 ] Origins [ edit ] Flat art developed out of the rise of vector graphic programs, and a nostalgia for mid-century modern illustration.

[ 3 ] It began to trend in editorial illustration and especially the tech industry, which relied on simple, scalable illustrations to fill white space and add character to apps and web pages.

[ 1 ] The style was widely popularized when Facebook introduced Alegria, an illustration system commissioned from design agency Buck Studios and illustrator Xoana Herrera [ 1 ] in 2017.

[ 4 ] The name "Corporate Memphis" originated from the title of an Are.na board that collected early examples, [ 1 ] and is a reference to the Memphis Group , a 1980s design group known for bright colors, childish patterns, and geometric shapes. The style itself was inspired by a synthesis of elements spanning the 20th-century, including the Art Deco style of the 1920s, futurism in interior design from the Atomic Age , and color and patterns from the Pop Art movement .

Visual characteristics [ edit ] Corporate Memphis style artwork featuring characters with blue, orange, and purple skintones Common motifs are flat human characters in action, with disproportionate features such as long and bendy limbs, [ 2 ] small torsos, [ 5 ] minimal or no facial features, and bright colors without any blending. Facebook's Alegria uses non-representational skin colors such as blues and purples in order to feel universal, [ 4 ] though some artists working in the style opt for more realistic skin colors and features to show diversity.

[ 1 ] Corporate Memphis is materially quick, cheap and easy to produce, and thus appealing to companies; programs such as Adobe Illustrator can be used to produce such designs rapidly.

[ citation needed ] Reception and use [ edit ] Once Facebook had adopted the style, the sudden ubiquity of vector graphics led to a critical backlash.

[ 3 ] The style has been criticized professionally and popularly (including in myriad internet memes ) for being overly minimalistic, generic, [ 6 ] lazy, [ 2 ] overused, and attempting to sanitize public perception of big tech companies by presenting human interaction in utopian optimism .

[ 1 ] Criticism of the art style is often rooted in larger anxieties about the creative industry under capitalism and neoliberalism .

[ 5 ] Others have argued that Corporate Memphis deserves to be understood on its own merits separate from the corporations which regularly employ it.

[ 3 ] Writing in The Globe and Mail , Jen Gerson criticized the new 2023 Canadian passport design by likening it to the Corporate Memphis art style.
