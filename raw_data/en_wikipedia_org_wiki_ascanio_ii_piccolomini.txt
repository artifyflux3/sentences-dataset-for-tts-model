[ 1 ] Ascanio was a mathematics pupil of Bonaventura Cavalieri .

[ 2 ] He hosted Galileo in Siena .

[ 3 ] According to Dava Sobel , Galileo 's ability "to rise from the ashes of his condemnation by the Inquisition" and complete perhaps his most influential book, the Two New Sciences , was "due in large measure to Piccolomini's solicitous kindness".

[ 4 ] He was an elder brother of the Imperial general Ottavio Piccolomini .

While bishop, he was the principal co-consecrator of Carlo Fabrizio Giustiniani , Bishop of Accia and Mariana (1656).
