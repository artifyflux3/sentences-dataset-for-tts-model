Borovik (born 1956) is a Professor of Pure Mathematics at the University of Manchester , United Kingdom . He was born in Russia and graduated from Novosibirsk State University in 1978.  His principal research lies in algebra , model theory , and combinatorics —topics on which he published several monographs and a number of papers.

[ 1 ] He also has an interest in mathematical practice: his book Mathematics under the Microscope: Notes on Cognitive Aspects of Mathematical Practice examines a mathematician's outlook on psychophysiological and cognitive issues in mathematics.
