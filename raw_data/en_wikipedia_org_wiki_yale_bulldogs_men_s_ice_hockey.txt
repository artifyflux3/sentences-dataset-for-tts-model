Team history [ edit ] Origins: Malcolm Greene Chace [ edit ] Malcolm Greene Chace Financier Malcolm Greene Chace (Yale class of 1896) [ 1 ] is credited with introducing ice hockey to the United States while a Yale student.

[ 2 ] Chace had been a tennis champion and avid player of ice polo, a game which predated hockey in the United States.

[ 3 ] In 1892, while competing in an international tennis tournament in Niagara Falls, New York , Chace was introduced to the game of ice hockey by members of Canada's Victoria Hockey Club .

[ 4 ] [ 3 ] [ 2 ] During the following Christmas break, Chace formed a team made up of Brown , Harvard , Cornell and Columbia students and played a ten-game schedule in Canada, with the goal of learning the Canadian game.

[ 4 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] After their tour, the students established hockey clubs at their respective schools.

[ 3 ] Chace led the Yale team as captain in their game against Baltimore on February 14, 1896, winning 2–1.

[ 1 ] Over a century later in 1998, Yale established the position of Malcolm G. Chace Head Hockey Coach in his honor.

[ 1 ] A portrait of Chace hangs in The Schley Room at Ingalls Rink.

[ 1 ] The Malcolm G. Chace Award is given each year to the player who "best exemplifies leadership and the traditions of the sport at Yale".

The Yale Men's Ice Hockey team is the oldest existing intercollegiate ice hockey program in the United States, the program traces its roots back to 1893.

[ 5 ] Yale played its first intercollegiate match on February 1, 1896, against Johns Hopkins , resulting in a 2–2 tie.

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] In the early years of the program, the team played under the direction of captains in a player-coach role and team managers.

[ 8 ] Despite not having an official head coach, the team proved successful in the early years of the program playing various amateur athletic clubs and a growing number of intercollegiate teams at various schools in the Northeast .

[ 6 ] Yale won its first intercollegiate championship in the fourth season of the program in 1899 when the Bulldogs went 6–0 through the season. Yale continued its early success winning the intercollegiate championship in each of the next three seasons.

[ 6 ] On February 22, 1904, the Bulldogs played their 100th game at the St. Nicholas Rink in New York , a 2–5 loss against rival Harvard .

[ 6 ] The team won its 100th game on January 8, 1913, with a 6–0 shutout at Columbia .

[ 6 ] Fred Rocque became the program's first head coach in the 1916–17 season, during which the team finished with ten wins and four losses.

[ 6 ] The following two seasons from 1917 to 1919, the team only played three games due to the World War . Following the break, Talbot Hunter took over as head coach for the 1919–20 season. Hunter's Yale team began the season on a five-game trip to Canada , the first time an American university would make such a trip. During the rest of the 1919–20 season and through the 1920–21 season Yale played home games in Philadelphia due to poor ice conditions at the Bulldogs home rink.

[ 6 ] Clarence Wanamaker took over as head coach after serving as the coach of Dartmouth from 1915 to 1920.

[ 8 ] Wanamaker would become the first multi-year head coach in program history and led the team from 1921 to 1928. In his sixth season, the 1926–27 season, ice hockey was given major sport status by the university.

[ 6 ] He led the program to a record high 18-win season in 1922–23 and followed that season with a 14-win season, the first back to back double digit-win seasons in program history.

[ 8 ] The Quadrangular League was created for the 1933–34 with Harvard, Yale, Princeton and Dartmouth. The league is considered the predecessor to the Ivy League and ECAC Hockey .

[ 9 ] In 1936, the Council of Ivy Group Presidents agreed on the formal formation of the League, however the agreement did not go into effect until the 1955–56 season.

[ 9 ] Yale won the Hobey Baker Trophy, given to Quadrangular League champions in the 1934–35 season.

[ 6 ] In 1938, the university hired former New York Rangers player, Murray Murdoch to take over the hockey program. Murdoch quickly turned the Bulldogs team around, after three consecutive losing seasons, he recorded back-to-back 10-win seasons followed by a 12-win and 14-win season. Seasons were shortened from 1942 to 1946 during World War II and following the war Army joined the Quadrangular League and it became known as the Pentagonal League in 1946–47.

[ 9 ] Army left the league after two season, but was replaced by Brown .

[ 9 ] In the 1951–52 season, the Bulldogs swept through the Pentagonal League with a 6–1–0 league record and finished the regular season 16–7–0. The team received a bid to the 1952 NCAA Ice Hockey tournament . It was the first Frozen Four appearance by the university.

[ 8 ] The four-team tournament, still in its early years, having first been played in 1948, was held at the Broadmoor Arena in Colorado Springs, Colorado .

[ 10 ] Yale lost to the hometown Colorado College Tigers but won the consolation game 4–1 over St. Lawrence to place third in the tournament.

[ 10 ] Murdoch guided Yale to its 500th program win in the 1953–54 season on March 3, 1954, in a 10–7 win over Providence .

[ 6 ] In 1961 Yale and the other members of the Pentagonal League joined various other schools in New England to form the 28-team ECAC Hockey .

[ 11 ] After two seasons a number of the smaller programs split leaving the ECAC with the Ivy League schools and a number of other Division I programs.

[ 12 ] Murray Murdoch ended his tenure as Yale head coach after 27 seasons in 1965. Murdoch finished with a record of 271–234–20, lead the Bulldogs to two Hobey Baker Trophy Quadrangular League Championships, and the program's first NCAA Frozen Four appearance.

[ 13 ] Taylor era (1976–2006) [ edit ] Ingalls Rink, completed in 1958 Tim Taylor , a 1963 Harvard graduate and Crimson assistant coach from 1969 to 1976 under Cooney Weiland, took over the Yale program in 1976 after a number of losing seasons, [ 6 ] including the 1974–75 season when the team finished 1–21–1 (.065).

[ 8 ] With Taylor behind the bench, the program turned around and within two seasons Taylor lead the Bulldogs to a 14-win season.

[ 8 ] In the 1984–85 and 1985–86 seasons, Yale reached back-to-back 20-win seasons for the first time in program history.

[ 8 ] That same season, on November 15, 1986, Yale beat rival Harvard 7–5 to win the 100th game of the Taylor era. With the win he became the second Yale coach to win at least 100 games.

[ 6 ] Yale won its first ECAC Regular season Champion in the 1997–98 season. Despite losing in the ECAC playoffs to Harvard, Yale received an at-large bid to the 1998 NCAA Ice Hockey tournament .

[ 14 ] The Bulldogs lost in the opening round of the NCAA tournament 0–4 to Ohio State .

[ 14 ] The Bulldogs finished the season setting a new program best record of 23–9–3 (.700).

[ 16 ] The win would become Taylor's last victory as Yale head coach after Yale's season ended with a 2-game sweep by Dartmouth in the second round of the ECAC playoffs.

[ 6 ] Tim Taylor was let go at the conclusion of the 2005–06 season after 28 seasons as head coach of the team. During his program leading tenure Taylor recorded 342 wins, 433 losses 55 ties; becoming the first Yale coach to eclipse the 300 win mark.

[ 8 ] He coached more games than any other ECAC coach and guided Yale to 19 ECAC playoff appearances, the 1997 Cleary Cup - awarded to the ECAC Regular season Champion, and one NCAA tournament appearance.

[ 15 ] In addition, he coached all six of the school's Hobey Baker Award finalists 30 years at Yale.

[ 15 ] Taylor missed two seasons in 1984 and 1994 to coach United States Olympic Team .

[ 15 ] Allain era (2006–2025) [ edit ] In 2006 Keith Allain , a 1980 graduate of Yale, was named the school's eighth coach in program history and first new head coach in 30 years.

Yale captured the Cleary Cup for ECAC Regular season Champions in the 2008–09 season. The Bulldogs followed the regular season by sweeping Brown in the ECAC Quarterfinal Round then getting a 4–3 win over St. Lawrence 4–3. In the ECAC Championship, Yale shut out Cornell 5–0 for the program's first ECAC Playoff Championship. The win sent the Bulldogs to the 2009 NCAA Ice Hockey tournament .

[ 18 ] After falling 1–4 to Vermont in the NCAA East Regional, [ 18 ] Yale finished the season with a record of 24–8–2, the first 20-win season since the 1997–98 season.
