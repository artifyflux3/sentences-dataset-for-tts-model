[ 1 ] It is based on the reduction and subsequent oxidation of iron ions, particularly the reduction and oxidation between Fe 3+ and Fe 2+ . The ferrites , or iron oxide, begins in the form of a spinel and depending on the reaction conditions, dopant metals and support material forms either Wüstites or different spinels.

Process description [ edit ] The thermochemical two-step water splitting process uses two redox steps. The steps of solar hydrogen production by iron based two-step cycle are: { M II Fe 2 III O 4 ⟶ ⟶ M II O + 2 Fe II O + 1 2 O 2 ( Reduction ) M II O + 2 Fe II O + H 2 O ⟶ ⟶ M II Fe 2 III O 4 + H 2 ( Oxidation ) {\displaystyle {\begin{cases}{\ce {M^{II}Fe2^{III}O4 -> M^{II}O + 2Fe^{II}O + 1/2O2}}&{\ce {(Reduction)}}\\{\ce {M^{II}O + 2Fe^{II}O + H2O -> M^{II}Fe2^{III}O4 + H2}}&{\ce {(Oxidation)}}\end{cases}}} Where M can by any number of metals, often Fe itself, Co , Ni , Mn , Zn or mixtures thereof.

The endothermic reduction step (1) is carried out at high temperatures greater than 1400 °C , though the " Hercynite cycle" is capable of temperatures as low as 1200 °C . The  oxidative water splitting step (2) occurs at a lower ~ 1000 °C temperature which produces the original ferrite material in addition to hydrogen gas. The temperature level is realized by using geothermal heat from magma [ 2 ] or a solar power tower and a set of heliostats to collect the solar thermal energy .

Hercynite cycle [ edit ] Like the traditional iron oxide cycle, the hercynite is based on the oxidation and reduction of iron atoms. However unlike the traditional cycle, the ferrite material reacts with a second metal oxide, aluminum oxide , rather than simply decomposing. The reactions take place via the following two reactions: { M II Fe 2 III O 4 + 3 Al 2 O 3 ⟶ ⟶ M II Al 2 III O 4 + 2 Fe II Al 2 III O 4 + 1 2 O 2 ( Reduction ) M II Al 2 III O 4 + 2 Fe II Al 2 III O 4 + H 2 O ⟶ ⟶ M II Fe 2 III O 4 + 3 Al 2 O 3 + H 2 ( Oxidation ) {\displaystyle {\begin{cases}{\ce {M^{II}Fe2^{III}O4 + 3Al2O3 -> M^{II}Al2^{III}O4 + 2Fe^{II}Al2^{III}O4 + 1/2O2}}&{\ce {(Reduction)}}\\{\ce {M^{II}Al2^{III}O4 + 2Fe^{II}Al2^{III}O4 + H2O -> M^{II}Fe2^{III}O4 + 3Al2O3 + H2}}&{\ce {(Oxidation)}}\end{cases}}} The reduction step of the hercynite reaction takes place at temperature ~ 200 °C lower than the traditional water splitting cycle ( 1200 °C ).

[ 3 ] This leads to lower radiation losses, which scale as temperature to the fourth power.

Advantages and disadvantages [ edit ] The advantages of the ferrite cycles are: they have lower reduction temperatures than other 2-step systems, no metallic gasses are produced, high specific H 2 production capacity, non-toxicity of the elements used and abundance of the constituent elements.

The disadvantages of the ferrite cycles are: similar reduction and melting temperature of the spinels (except for the hercynite cycle as aluminates have very high melting temperatures), and slow rates of the oxidation, or water splitting , reaction.
