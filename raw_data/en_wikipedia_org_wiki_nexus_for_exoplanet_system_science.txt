The **Nexus for Exoplanet System Science** (**NExSS**) initiative is a National Aeronautics and Space Administration ([NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA "NASA")) virtual institute designed to foster interdisciplinary collaboration in the search for [life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life "Extraterrestrial life") on [exoplanets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoplanet "Exoplanet"). Led by the [Ames Research Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ames_Research_Center "Ames Research Center"), the [NASA Exoplanet Science Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_Exoplanet_Science_Institute "NASA Exoplanet Science Institute"), and the [Goddard Institute for Space Studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goddard_Institute_for_Space_Studies "Goddard Institute for Space Studies"), NExSS will help organize the search for life on exoplanets from participating research teams and acquire new knowledge about exoplanets and extrasolar planetary systems.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_for_Exoplanet_System_Science#cite_note-loff-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_for_Exoplanet_System_Science#cite_note-gronstal-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_for_Exoplanet_System_Science#cite_note-AST-2008-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_for_Exoplanet_System_Science#cite_note-NASA-20180625-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_for_Exoplanet_System_Science#cite_note-EA-20180625-6)

What does life produce?[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_for_Exoplanet_System_Science#cite_note-NASA-20180625-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_for_Exoplanet_System_Science#cite_note-EA-20180625-6)

In 1995, astronomers using ground-based observatories discovered [51 Pegasi b](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/51_Pegasi_b "51 Pegasi b"), the first exoplanet orbiting a [Sun-like star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_analog "Solar analog").[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_for_Exoplanet_System_Science#cite_note-uw-7) NASA launched the [Kepler space telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler_space_telescope "Kepler space telescope") in 2009 to search for [Earth-size](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrestrial_planet "Terrestrial planet") exoplanets. By 2015, they had confirmed more than a thousand exoplanets,[[note 1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_for_Exoplanet_System_Science#cite_note-epc-9) while several thousand additional candidates awaited confirmation.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_for_Exoplanet_System_Science#cite_note-netburn-10)

To help coordinate efforts to sift through and understand the data, NASA needed a way for researchers to collaborate across disciplines. The success of the [Virtual Planetary Laboratory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Planetary_Laboratory "Virtual Planetary Laboratory") research network at the [University of Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Washington "University of Washington") led [Mary A. Voytek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Voytek "Mary Voytek"), director of the [NASA Astrobiology Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_Astrobiology_Institute#Program "NASA Astrobiology Institute"), to model its structure and create the Nexus for Exoplanet System Science (NExSS) initiative.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_for_Exoplanet_System_Science#cite_note-tollefson-1)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_for_Exoplanet_System_Science#cite_note-kelley-11) Leaders from three NASA research centers will run the program: [Natalie Batalha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalie_Batalha "Natalie Batalha") of NASA's Ames Research Center, [Dawn Gelino](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dawn_Gelino&action=edit&redlink=1 "Dawn Gelino (page does not exist)") of the NASA Exoplanet Science Institute, and [Anthony Del Genio](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anthony_Del_Genio&action=edit&redlink=1 "Anthony Del Genio (page does not exist)") of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_for_Exoplanet_System_Science#cite_note-carreau-12)

Functioning as a virtual institute, NExSS is currently composed of sixteen interdisciplinary science teams from ten universities, three NASA centers and two research institutes, who will work together to search for habitable exoplanets that can support life.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_for_Exoplanet_System_Science#cite_note-sanders-13) The US teams were initially selected from a total of about 200 proposals; however, the coalition is expected to expand nationally and internationally as the project gets underway.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_for_Exoplanet_System_Science#cite_note-cassidy-14) Teams will also work with amateur [citizen scientists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_science "Citizen science") who will have the ability to access the public Kepler data and search for exoplanets.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_for_Exoplanet_System_Science#cite_note-carreau-12)

NExSS will draw from scientific expertise in each of the four divisions of the [Science Mission Directorate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_Mission_Directorate "Science Mission Directorate"): [Earth science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_science "Earth science"), [planetary science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_science "Planetary science"), [heliophysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliophysics "Heliophysics") and [astrophysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics "Astrophysics").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_for_Exoplanet_System_Science#cite_note-loff-2) NExSS research will directly contribute to understanding and interpreting future exoplanet data from the upcoming launches of the [Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transiting_Exoplanet_Survey_Satellite "Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite") and [James Webb Space Telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Webb_Space_Telescope "James Webb Space Telescope"), as well as the planned [Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Grace_Roman_Space_Telescope "Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope") mission.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_for_Exoplanet_System_Science#cite_note-loff-2)
