An overview of absorption of [electromagnetic radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation "Electromagnetic radiation"). This example shows the general principle using [visible light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visible_spectrum "Visible spectrum") as a specific example. A white [light source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_source "Light source")—emitting light of multiple [wavelengths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelength "Wavelength")—is focused on a sample (the pairs of [complementary colors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementary_color "Complementary color") are indicated by the yellow dotted lines). Upon striking the sample, [photons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon "Photon") that match the [energy gap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_gap "Energy gap") of the [molecules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule "Molecule") present (green light in this example) are _absorbed_, exciting the molecules. Other photons are scattered (not shown here) or transmitted unaffected; if the radiation is in the visible region (400–700 nm), the transmitted light appears as the complementary color (here red). By recording the [attenuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuation "Attenuation") of light for various wavelengths, an [absorption spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_spectroscopy "Absorption spectroscopy") can be obtained.

In [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics"), **absorption** of [electromagnetic radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation "Electromagnetic radiation") is how [matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter "Matter") (typically [electrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrons "Electrons") bound in [atoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom "Atom")) takes up a [photon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon "Photon")'s [energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy "Energy")—and so transforms [electromagnetic energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiant_energy "Radiant energy") into [internal energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_energy "Internal energy") of the absorber (for example, [thermal energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_energy "Thermal energy")).[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_(electromagnetic_radiation)#cite_note-1)

A notable effect of the absorption of electromagnetic radiation is [attenuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuation "Attenuation") of the radiation; attenuation is the gradual reduction of the [intensity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensity_(physics) "Intensity (physics)") of [light waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_waves "Light waves") as they [propagate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_propagation "Wave propagation") through a medium.

Although the absorption of waves does not usually depend on their intensity (linear absorption), in certain conditions ([optics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics "Optics")) the medium's transparency changes by a factor that varies as a function of wave intensity, and [saturable absorption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturable_absorption "Saturable absorption") (or nonlinear absorption) occurs.

Quantifying absorption
----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Absorption_(electromagnetic_radiation)&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Quantifying absorption")]

Many approaches can potentially quantify radiation absorption, with key examples following.

*   The absorption coefficient along with some closely related derived quantities
*   The [attenuation coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuation_coefficient "Attenuation coefficient") (NB used infrequently with meaning synonymous with "absorption coefficient")[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]
*   The [Molar attenuation coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_attenuation_coefficient "Molar attenuation coefficient") (also called "molar absorptivity"), which is the absorption coefficient divided by molarity (see also [Beer–Lambert law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer%E2%80%93Lambert_law "Beer–Lambert law"))
*   The [mass attenuation coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_attenuation_coefficient "Mass attenuation coefficient") (also called "mass extinction coefficient"), which is the absorption coefficient divided by density
*   The [absorption cross section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_cross_section "Absorption cross section") and [scattering cross-section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattering_cross-section "Scattering cross-section"), related closely to the absorption and attenuation coefficients, respectively
*   ["Extinction" in astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction_(astronomy) "Extinction (astronomy)"), which is equivalent to the attenuation coefficient
*   Other measures of radiation absorption, including [penetration depth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penetration_depth "Penetration depth") and [skin effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_effect "Skin effect"), [propagation constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propagation_constant "Propagation constant"), [attenuation constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propagation_constant#Attenuation_constant "Propagation constant"), [phase constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propagation_constant#Phase_constant "Propagation constant"), and complex [wavenumber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavenumber "Wavenumber"), [complex refractive index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractive_index "Refractive index") and [extinction coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractive_index#Dispersion_and_absorption "Refractive index"), [complex dielectric constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_permittivity "Relative permittivity"), [electrical resistivity and conductivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistivity_and_conductivity "Electrical resistivity and conductivity").
*   Related measures, including [absorbance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorbance "Absorbance") (also called "optical density") and [optical depth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_depth "Optical depth") (also called "optical thickness")

All these quantities measure, at least to some extent, how well a medium absorbs radiation. Which among them practitioners use varies by field and technique, often due simply to the convention.

Measuring absorption
--------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Absorption_(electromagnetic_radiation)&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Measuring absorption")]

The [absorbance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorbance "Absorbance") of an object quantifies how much of the incident light is absorbed by it (instead of being [reflected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(physics) "Reflection (physics)") or [refracted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction "Refraction")). This may be related to other properties of the object through the [Beer–Lambert law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer%E2%80%93Lambert_law "Beer–Lambert law").

Precise measurements of the absorbance at many wavelengths allow the identification of a substance via [absorption spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_spectroscopy "Absorption spectroscopy"), where a sample is illuminated from one side, and the intensity of the light that exits from the sample in every direction is measured. A few examples of absorption are [ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet%E2%80%93visible_spectroscopy "Ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy"), [infrared spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_spectroscopy "Infrared spectroscopy"), and [X-ray absorption spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_absorption_spectroscopy "X-ray absorption spectroscopy").

Rough plot of Earth's atmospheric [transmittance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmittance "Transmittance") (or opacity) to various wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation, including [visible light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visible_light "Visible light")

Understanding and measuring the absorption of electromagnetic radiation has a variety of applications.

*   In [radio propagation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_propagation "Radio propagation"), it is represented in [non-line-of-sight propagation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-line-of-sight_propagation "Non-line-of-sight propagation"). For example, see [computation of radio wave attenuation in the atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computation_of_radiowave_attenuation_in_the_atmosphere "Computation of radiowave attenuation in the atmosphere") used in satellite link design.
*   In [meteorology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology "Meteorology") and [climatology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climatology "Climatology"), global and local temperatures depend in part on the absorption of radiation by [atmospheric gases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_gases "Atmospheric gases") (such as in the [greenhouse effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_effect "Greenhouse effect")) and land and ocean surfaces (see [albedo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albedo "Albedo")).
*   In [medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine "Medicine"), [X-rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray "X-ray") are absorbed to different extents by different tissues ([bone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone "Bone") in particular), which is the basis for [X-ray imaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projectional_radiography "Projectional radiography").
*   In [chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry "Chemistry") and [materials science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materials_science "Materials science"), different materials and molecules absorb radiation to different extents at different frequencies, which allows for material identification.
*   In [optics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics "Optics"), sunglasses, colored filters, dyes, and other such materials are designed specifically with respect to which visible wavelengths they absorb, and in what proportions they are in.
*   In [biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology "Biology"), photosynthetic organisms require that light of the appropriate wavelengths be absorbed within the active area of [chloroplasts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloroplast "Chloroplast"), so that the [light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light "Light") energy can be converted into [chemical energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_energy "Chemical energy") within sugars and other molecules.
*   In [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics"), the D-region of Earth's [ionosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere "Ionosphere") is known to significantly absorb radio signals that fall within the high-frequency electromagnetic spectrum.
*   In nuclear physics, absorption of nuclear radiations can be used for measuring the fluid levels, densitometry or thickness measurements.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_(electromagnetic_radiation)#cite_note-2)

In scientific literature is known a system of mirrors and lenses that with a laser "can enable any material to absorb all light from a wide range of angles."[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_(electromagnetic_radiation)#cite_note-3)
