Biography [ edit ] Rudolf Lipschitz was born on 14 May 1832 in Königsberg . He was the son of a landowner and was raised at his father's estate at Bönkein which was near Königsberg.

[ 1 ] He entered the University of Königsberg when he was 15, but later moved to the University of Berlin where he studied with Gustav Dirichlet . Despite having his studies delayed by illness, in 1853 Lipschitz graduated with a PhD in Berlin.

[ 2 ] After receiving his PhD, Lipschitz started teaching at local Gymnasiums . In 1857 he married Ida Pascha, the daughter of one of the landowners with an estate near to his father's, [ 1 ] and earned his habilitation at the University of Bonn , where he remained as a privatdozent . In 1862 Lipschitz became an extraordinary professor at the University of Breslau where he spent the following two years. In 1864 Lipschitz moved back to Bonn as a full professor. He was appointed Bonn's first chair of Mathematics in 1869.

[ 3 ] He remained there for the rest of his career. Here he examined the dissertation of Felix Klein . Lipschitz died on 7 October 1903 in Bonn.
