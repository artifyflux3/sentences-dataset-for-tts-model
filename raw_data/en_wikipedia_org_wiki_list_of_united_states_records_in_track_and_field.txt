The following are the national records in track and field in the United States. Some of the records are maintained by USA Track & Field (USATF). Outdoor times for track races between 200 meters to 10,000 meters are set on 400-meter unbanked tracks. Indoor marks are established on 200-meter tracks, banked or unbanked. Indoor tracks longer than 200 meters are considered "oversized" and times are not accepted for record purposes. Indoor sprint races (50 to 60 meters) are held on level straight-aways.

American athletes are successful on an international stage with many American records being at the same time world records .
