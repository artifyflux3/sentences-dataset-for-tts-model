( October 2013 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) In differential geometry , a fibered manifold is surjective submersion of smooth manifolds Y → X . Locally trivial fibered manifolds are fiber bundles . Therefore, a notion of connection on fibered manifolds provides a general framework of a connection on fiber bundles.

Formal definition [ edit ] Let π : Y → X be a fibered manifold. A generalized connection on Y is a section Γ : Y → J 1 Y , where J 1 Y is the jet manifold of Y .

[ 1 ] Connection as a horizontal splitting [ edit ] With the above manifold π there is the following canonical short exact sequence of vector bundles over Y : 0 → → V Y → → T Y → → Y × × X T X → → 0 , {\displaystyle 0\to \mathrm {V} Y\to \mathrm {T} Y\to Y\times _{X}\mathrm {T} X\to 0\,,} 1 where T Y and T X are the tangent bundles of Y , respectively, V Y is the vertical tangent bundle of Y , and Y × X T X is the pullback bundle of T X onto Y .

A connection on a fibered manifold Y → X is defined as a linear bundle morphism Γ Γ : Y × × X T X → → T Y {\displaystyle \Gamma :Y\times _{X}\mathrm {T} X\to \mathrm {T} Y} 2 over Y which splits the exact sequence 1 . A connection always exists.

Sometimes, this connection Γ is called the Ehresmann connection because it yields the horizontal distribution H Y = Γ Γ ( Y × × X T X ) ⊂ ⊂ T Y {\displaystyle \mathrm {H} Y=\Gamma \left(Y\times _{X}\mathrm {T} X\right)\subset \mathrm {T} Y} of T Y and its horizontal decomposition T Y = V Y ⊕ H Y .

At the same time, by an Ehresmann connection also is meant the following construction.  Any connection Γ on a fibered manifold Y → X yields a horizontal lift Γ ∘ τ of a vector field τ on X onto Y , but need not defines the similar lift of a path in X into Y . Let R ⊃ ⊃ [ , ] ∋ ∋ t → → x ( t ) ∈ ∈ X R ∋ ∋ t → → y ( t ) ∈ ∈ Y {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\mathbb {R} \supset [,]\ni t&\to x(t)\in X\\\mathbb {R} \ni t&\to y(t)\in Y\end{aligned}}} be two smooth paths in X and Y , respectively. Then t → y ( t ) is called the horizontal lift of x ( t ) if π π ( y ( t ) ) = x ( t ) , y ˙ ˙ ( t ) ∈ ∈ H Y , t ∈ ∈ R .

{\displaystyle \pi (y(t))=x(t)\,,\qquad {\dot {y}}(t)\in \mathrm {H} Y\,,\qquad t\in \mathbb {R} \,.} A connection Γ is said to be the Ehresmann connection if, for each path x ([0,1]) in X ,  there exists its horizontal lift through any point y ∈ π −1 ( x ([0,1])) . A fibered manifold is a fiber bundle if and only if it admits such an Ehresmann connection.

Connection as a tangent-valued form [ edit ] Given a fibered manifold Y → X , let it be endowed with an atlas of fibered coordinates ( x μ , y i ) , and let Γ be a connection on Y → X . It yields uniquely the horizontal tangent-valued one-form Γ Γ = d x μ μ ⊗ ⊗ ( ∂ ∂ μ μ + Γ Γ μ μ i ( x ν ν , y j ) ∂ ∂ i ) {\displaystyle \Gamma =dx^{\mu }\otimes \left(\partial _{\mu }+\Gamma _{\mu }^{i}\left(x^{\nu },y^{j}\right)\partial _{i}\right)} 3 on Y which projects onto the canonical tangent-valued form ( tautological one-form or solder form ) θ θ X = d x μ μ ⊗ ⊗ ∂ ∂ μ μ {\displaystyle \theta _{X}=dx^{\mu }\otimes \partial _{\mu }} on X , and vice versa . With this form, the horizontal splitting 2 reads Γ Γ : ∂ ∂ μ μ → → ∂ ∂ μ μ ⌋ ⌋ Γ Γ = ∂ ∂ μ μ + Γ Γ μ μ i ∂ ∂ i .

{\displaystyle \Gamma :\partial _{\mu }\to \partial _{\mu }\rfloor \Gamma =\partial _{\mu }+\Gamma _{\mu }^{i}\partial _{i}\,.} In particular, the connection Γ in 3 yields the horizontal lift of any vector field τ = τ μ ∂ μ on X to a projectable vector field Γ Γ τ τ = τ τ ⌋ ⌋ Γ Γ = τ τ μ μ ( ∂ ∂ μ μ + Γ Γ μ μ i ∂ ∂ i ) ⊂ ⊂ H Y {\displaystyle \Gamma \tau =\tau \rfloor \Gamma =\tau ^{\mu }\left(\partial _{\mu }+\Gamma _{\mu }^{i}\partial _{i}\right)\subset \mathrm {H} Y} on Y .

Connection as a vertical-valued form [ edit ] The horizontal splitting 2 of the exact sequence 1 defines the corresponding splitting of the dual exact sequence 0 → → Y × × X T ∗ ∗ X → → T ∗ ∗ Y → → V ∗ ∗ Y → → 0 , {\displaystyle 0\to Y\times _{X}\mathrm {T} ^{*}X\to \mathrm {T} ^{*}Y\to \mathrm {V} ^{*}Y\to 0\,,} where T* Y and T* X are the cotangent bundles of Y , respectively, and V* Y → Y is the dual bundle to V Y → Y , called the vertical cotangent bundle. This splitting is given by the vertical-valued form Γ Γ = ( d y i − − Γ Γ λ λ i d x λ λ ) ⊗ ⊗ ∂ ∂ i , {\displaystyle \Gamma =\left(dy^{i}-\Gamma _{\lambda }^{i}dx^{\lambda }\right)\otimes \partial _{i}\,,} which also represents a connection on a fibered manifold.

Treating a connection as a vertical-valued form, one comes to the following important construction. Given a fibered manifold Y → X , let f : X ′ → X be a morphism and f ∗ Y → X ′ the pullback bundle of Y by f . Then any connection Γ 3 on Y → X induces the pullback connection f ∗ ∗ Γ Γ = ( d y i − − ( Γ Γ ∘ ∘ f ~ ~ ) λ λ i ∂ ∂ f λ λ ∂ ∂ x ′ μ μ d x ′ μ μ ) ⊗ ⊗ ∂ ∂ i {\displaystyle f*\Gamma =\left(dy^{i}-\left(\Gamma \circ {\tilde {f}}\right)_{\lambda }^{i}{\frac {\partial f^{\lambda }}{\partial x'^{\mu }}}dx'^{\mu }\right)\otimes \partial _{i}} on f ∗ Y → X ′ .

Connection as a jet bundle section [ edit ] Let J 1 Y be the jet manifold of sections of a fibered manifold Y → X , with coordinates ( x μ , y i , y i μ ) . Due to the canonical imbedding J 1 Y → → Y ( Y × × X T ∗ ∗ X ) ⊗ ⊗ Y T Y , ( y μ μ i ) → → d x μ μ ⊗ ⊗ ( ∂ ∂ μ μ + y μ μ i ∂ ∂ i ) , {\displaystyle \mathrm {J} ^{1}Y\to _{Y}\left(Y\times _{X}\mathrm {T} ^{*}X\right)\otimes _{Y}\mathrm {T} Y\,,\qquad \left(y_{\mu }^{i}\right)\to dx^{\mu }\otimes \left(\partial _{\mu }+y_{\mu }^{i}\partial _{i}\right)\,,} any connection Γ 3 on a fibered manifold Y → X is represented by a global section Γ Γ : Y → → J 1 Y , y λ λ i ∘ ∘ Γ Γ = Γ Γ λ λ i , {\displaystyle \Gamma :Y\to \mathrm {J} ^{1}Y\,,\qquad y_{\lambda }^{i}\circ \Gamma =\Gamma _{\lambda }^{i}\,,} of the jet bundle J 1 Y → Y , and vice versa . It is an affine bundle modelled on a vector bundle ( Y × × X T ∗ ∗ X ) ⊗ ⊗ Y V Y → → Y .

{\displaystyle \left(Y\times _{X}T^{*}X\right)\otimes _{Y}\mathrm {V} Y\to Y\,.} 4 There are the following corollaries of this fact.

Connections on a fibered manifold Y → X make up an affine space modelled on the vector space of soldering forms σ σ = σ σ μ μ i d x μ μ ⊗ ⊗ ∂ ∂ i {\displaystyle \sigma =\sigma _{\mu }^{i}dx^{\mu }\otimes \partial _{i}} 5 on Y → X , i.e., sections of the vector bundle 4 .

Connection coefficients possess the coordinate transformation law Γ Γ ′ λ λ i = ∂ ∂ x μ μ ∂ ∂ x ′ λ λ ( ∂ ∂ μ μ y ′ i + Γ Γ μ μ j ∂ ∂ j y ′ i ) .

{\displaystyle {\Gamma '}_{\lambda }^{i}={\frac {\partial x^{\mu }}{\partial {x'}^{\lambda }}}\left(\partial _{\mu }{y'}^{i}+\Gamma _{\mu }^{j}\partial _{j}{y'}^{i}\right)\,.} Every connection Γ on a fibred manifold Y → X yields the first order differential operator D Γ Γ : J 1 Y → → Y T ∗ ∗ X ⊗ ⊗ Y V Y , D Γ Γ = ( y λ λ i − − Γ Γ λ λ i ) d x λ λ ⊗ ⊗ ∂ ∂ i , {\displaystyle D_{\Gamma }:\mathrm {J} ^{1}Y\to _{Y}\mathrm {T} ^{*}X\otimes _{Y}\mathrm {V} Y\,,\qquad D_{\Gamma }=\left(y_{\lambda }^{i}-\Gamma _{\lambda }^{i}\right)dx^{\lambda }\otimes \partial _{i}\,,} on Y called the covariant differential relative to the connection Γ . If s : X → Y is a section, its covariant differential ∇ ∇ Γ Γ s = ( ∂ ∂ λ λ s i − − Γ Γ λ λ i ∘ ∘ s ) d x λ λ ⊗ ⊗ ∂ ∂ i , {\displaystyle \nabla ^{\Gamma }s=\left(\partial _{\lambda }s^{i}-\Gamma _{\lambda }^{i}\circ s\right)dx^{\lambda }\otimes \partial _{i}\,,} and the covariant derivative ∇ ∇ τ τ Γ Γ s = τ τ ⌋ ⌋ ∇ ∇ Γ Γ s {\displaystyle \nabla _{\tau }^{\Gamma }s=\tau \rfloor \nabla ^{\Gamma }s} along a vector field τ on X are defined.

Curvature and torsion [ edit ] Given the connection Γ 3 on a fibered manifold Y → X , its curvature is defined as the Nijenhuis differential R = 1 2 d Γ Γ Γ Γ = 1 2 [ Γ Γ , Γ Γ ] F N = 1 2 R λ λ μ μ i d x λ λ ∧ ∧ d x μ μ ⊗ ⊗ ∂ ∂ i , R λ λ μ μ i = ∂ ∂ λ λ Γ Γ μ μ i − − ∂ ∂ μ μ Γ Γ λ λ i + Γ Γ λ λ j ∂ ∂ j Γ Γ μ μ i − − Γ Γ μ μ j ∂ ∂ j Γ Γ λ λ i .

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}R&={\tfrac {1}{2}}d_{\Gamma }\Gamma \\&={\tfrac {1}{2}}[\Gamma ,\Gamma ]_{\mathrm {FN} }\\&={\tfrac {1}{2}}R_{\lambda \mu }^{i}\,dx^{\lambda }\wedge dx^{\mu }\otimes \partial _{i}\,,\\R_{\lambda \mu }^{i}&=\partial _{\lambda }\Gamma _{\mu }^{i}-\partial _{\mu }\Gamma _{\lambda }^{i}+\Gamma _{\lambda }^{j}\partial _{j}\Gamma _{\mu }^{i}-\Gamma _{\mu }^{j}\partial _{j}\Gamma _{\lambda }^{i}\,.\end{aligned}}} This is a vertical-valued horizontal two-form on Y .

Given the connection Γ 3 and the soldering form σ 5 , a torsion of Γ with respect to σ is defined as T = d Γ Γ σ σ = ( ∂ ∂ λ λ σ σ μ μ i + Γ Γ λ λ j ∂ ∂ j σ σ μ μ i − − ∂ ∂ j Γ Γ λ λ i σ σ μ μ j ) d x λ λ ∧ ∧ d x μ μ ⊗ ⊗ ∂ ∂ i .

{\displaystyle T=d_{\Gamma }\sigma =\left(\partial _{\lambda }\sigma _{\mu }^{i}+\Gamma _{\lambda }^{j}\partial _{j}\sigma _{\mu }^{i}-\partial _{j}\Gamma _{\lambda }^{i}\sigma _{\mu }^{j}\right)\,dx^{\lambda }\wedge dx^{\mu }\otimes \partial _{i}\,.} Bundle of principal connections [ edit ] Let π : P → M be a principal bundle with a structure Lie group G . A principal connection on P usually is described by a Lie algebra-valued connection one-form on P .  At the same time, a principal connection on P is a global section of the jet bundle J 1 P → P which is equivariant with respect to the canonical right action of G in P . Therefore, it is represented by a global section of the quotient bundle C = J 1 P / G → M , called the bundle of principal connections . It is an affine bundle modelled on the vector bundle V P / G → M whose typical fiber is the Lie algebra g of structure group G , and where G acts on by the adjoint representation . There is the canonical imbedding of C to the quotient bundle T P / G which also is called the bundle of principal connections .

Given a basis {e m } for a Lie algebra of G , the fiber bundle C is endowed with bundle coordinates ( x μ , a m μ ) , and its sections are represented by vector-valued one-forms A = d x λ λ ⊗ ⊗ ( ∂ ∂ λ λ + a λ λ m e m ) , {\displaystyle A=dx^{\lambda }\otimes \left(\partial _{\lambda }+a_{\lambda }^{m}{\mathrm {e} }_{m}\right)\,,} where a λ λ m d x λ λ ⊗ ⊗ e m {\displaystyle a_{\lambda }^{m}\,dx^{\lambda }\otimes {\mathrm {e} }_{m}} are the familiar local connection forms on M .

Let us note that the jet bundle J 1 C of C is a configuration space of Yang–Mills gauge theory . It admits the canonical decomposition a λ λ μ μ r = 1 2 ( F λ λ μ μ r + S λ λ μ μ r ) = 1 2 ( a λ λ μ μ r + a μ μ λ λ r − − c p q r a λ λ p a μ μ q ) + 1 2 ( a λ λ μ μ r − − a μ μ λ λ r + c p q r a λ λ p a μ μ q ) , {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}a_{\lambda \mu }^{r}&={\tfrac {1}{2}}\left(F_{\lambda \mu }^{r}+S_{\lambda \mu }^{r}\right)\\&={\tfrac {1}{2}}\left(a_{\lambda \mu }^{r}+a_{\mu \lambda }^{r}-c_{pq}^{r}a_{\lambda }^{p}a_{\mu }^{q}\right)+{\tfrac {1}{2}}\left(a_{\lambda \mu }^{r}-a_{\mu \lambda }^{r}+c_{pq}^{r}a_{\lambda }^{p}a_{\mu }^{q}\right)\,,\end{aligned}}} where F = 1 2 F λ λ μ μ m d x λ λ ∧ ∧ d x μ μ ⊗ ⊗ e m {\displaystyle F={\tfrac {1}{2}}F_{\lambda \mu }^{m}\,dx^{\lambda }\wedge dx^{\mu }\otimes {\mathrm {e} }_{m}} is called the strength form of a principal connection.
