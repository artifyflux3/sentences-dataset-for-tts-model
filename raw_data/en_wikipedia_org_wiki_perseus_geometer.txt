Life [ edit ] Few details of Perseus' life are known, as he is mentioned only by Proclus and Geminus ; none of his own works have survived.

Spiric sections [ edit ] The spiric sections result from the intersection of a torus with a plane that is parallel to the rotational symmetry axis of the torus.  Consequently, spiric sections are fourth-order ( quartic ) plane curves , whereas the conic sections are second-order ( quadratic ) plane curves .  Spiric sections are a special case of a toric section , and were the first toric sections to be described.

Examples [ edit ] The most famous spiric section is the Cassini oval , which is the locus of points having a constant product of distances to two foci. For comparison, an ellipse has a constant sum of focal distances, a hyperbola has a constant difference of focal distances, and a circle has a constant ratio of focal distances.
