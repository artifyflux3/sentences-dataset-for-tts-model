In the book, Huizinga presents the idea that the exaggerated formality and romanticism of late medieval court society was a defence mechanism against the constantly increasing violence and brutality of general society. He saw the period as one of pessimism, cultural exhaustion, and nostalgia, rather than of rebirth and optimism.

His main conclusion is that the combination of required modernization of statehood governance, stuck in traditionalism, in combination with the exhausting inclusion of an ever-growing corpus of Catholic rites and popular beliefs in daily life, led to the implosion of late medieval society. This provided light to the rise of (religious) individualism, humanism and scientific progress: the Renaissance.

The book was nominated for the 1939 Nobel Prize for Literature , but lost to the Finnish writer Frans Eemil Sillanpää .

Huizinga's work later came under some criticism, especially for relying too heavily on evidence from the rather exceptional case of the Burgundian court. Other criticisms include the writing of the book being "old-fashioned" and "too literary".

[ 1 ] A new English translation of the book was published in 1996 because of perceived deficiencies in the original translation. The new translation, by Rodney Payton and Ulrich Mammitzsch, was based on the second edition of the Dutch publication in 1921 and compared with the German translation published in 1924.

Johan Huizinga: Autumntide of the Middle Ages . Book cover of 2020 edition.

To mark the centenary of Herfsttij , a new translation by Diane Webb appeared in 2020, published by Leiden University Press: Autumntide of the Middle Ages . According to Benjamin Kaplan , this translation "captures Huizinga's original voice better than either of the two previous English editions".

[ 2 ] This new English edition also includes for the first time 300 full-colour illustrations of all the works of art Huizinga mentions in his text.

In the 1970s, Radio Netherlands produced an audio series about the book, entitled "Autumn of the Middle Ages: A Six-part History in Words and Music from the Low Countries".
