 You deserve an explanation 

August 18: An important update for readers in the United States. 

Please don't skip this 1-minute read. It's Monday, August 18, and we're running a short fundraiser to support Wikipedia. If you've lost count of how many times you've visited Wikipedia this year, we hope that means it's given you at least $2.75 of knowledge. Please join the 2% of readers who give what they can to keep this valuable resource ad-free and available for all.

After nearly 25 years, Wikipedia is still the internet we were promised—created by people, not by machines. It's not perfect, but it's not here to push a point of view. It's owned by a non-profit, not a giant technology company or a billionaire.

Most readers donate because Wikipedia is useful to them, others because Wikipedia is more important than ever. If you feel the same, please donate $2.75 now—or consider a monthly gift to help all year. Thank you.

Basis for v whose vectors are mutually orthogonal

In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), particularly [linear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra "Linear algebra"), an **orthogonal basis** for an [inner product space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_product_space "Inner product space")V{\displaystyle V}![Image 42: {\displaystyle V}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/af0f6064540e84211d0ffe4dac72098adfa52845) is a [basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_(linear_algebra) "Basis (linear algebra)") for V{\displaystyle V}![Image 43: {\displaystyle V}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/af0f6064540e84211d0ffe4dac72098adfa52845) whose vectors are mutually [orthogonal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal "Orthogonal"). If the vectors of an orthogonal basis are [normalized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalize_(linear_algebra) "Normalize (linear algebra)"), the resulting basis is an _[orthonormal basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthonormal\_basis "Orthonormal basis")_.

As coordinates
--------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Orthogonal_basis&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: As coordinates")]

Any orthogonal basis can be used to define a system of [orthogonal coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_coordinates "Orthogonal coordinates")V.{\displaystyle V.}![Image 44: {\displaystyle V.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1b2661a49b86bd1a5548e527bbfb068aa9f59978) Orthogonal (not necessarily orthonormal) bases are important due to their appearance from [curvilinear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvilinear_coordinates "Curvilinear coordinates") orthogonal coordinates in [Euclidean spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space"), as well as in [Riemannian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_manifold "Riemannian manifold") and [pseudo-Riemannian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo-Riemannian_manifold "Pseudo-Riemannian manifold") manifolds.

In functional analysis
----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Orthogonal_basis&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: In functional analysis")]

In [functional analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_analysis "Functional analysis"), an orthogonal basis is any basis obtained from an orthonormal basis (or Hilbert basis) using multiplication by nonzero [scalars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_(mathematics) "Scalar (mathematics)").

### Quadratic form

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Orthogonal_basis&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Quadratic form")]

The concept of orthogonality may be extended to a vector space over any field of characteristic not 2 equipped with a quadratic form ⁠q(v){\displaystyle q(v)}![Image 62: {\displaystyle q(v)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/51581885bab391bc316bf852cda48cb1c3cbcd89)⁠. Starting from the observation that, when the characteristic of the underlying field is not 2, the associated symmetric bilinear form ⟨v,w⟩=1 2(q(v+w)−q(v)−q(w)){\displaystyle \langle v,w\rangle ={\tfrac {1}{2}}(q(v+w)-q(v)-q(w))}![Image 63: {\displaystyle \langle v,w\rangle ={\tfrac {1}{2}}(q(v+w)-q(v)-q(w))}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e4a6ee0c474e193f32db05724c52863358de5579) allows vectors v{\displaystyle v}![Image 64: {\displaystyle v}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e07b00e7fc0847fbd16391c778d65bc25c452597) and w{\displaystyle w}![Image 65: {\displaystyle w}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/88b1e0c8e1be5ebe69d18a8010676fa42d7961e6) to be defined as being orthogonal with respect to q{\displaystyle q}![Image 66: {\displaystyle q}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/06809d64fa7c817ffc7e323f85997f783dbdf71d) when ⁠q(v+w)−q(v)−q(w)=0{\displaystyle q(v+w)-q(v)-q(w)=0}![Image 67: {\displaystyle q(v+w)-q(v)-q(w)=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/485403c610c034a0ae95667506055f19d7a5665a)⁠.
