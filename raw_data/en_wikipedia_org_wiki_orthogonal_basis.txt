If the vectors of an orthogonal basis are normalized , the resulting basis is an orthonormal basis .

As coordinates [ edit ] Any orthogonal basis can be used to define a system of orthogonal coordinates V .

{\displaystyle V.} Orthogonal (not necessarily orthonormal) bases are important due to their appearance from curvilinear orthogonal coordinates in Euclidean spaces , as well as in Riemannian and pseudo-Riemannian manifolds.

In functional analysis [ edit ] In functional analysis , an orthogonal basis is any basis obtained from an orthonormal basis (or Hilbert basis) using multiplication by nonzero scalars .

Extensions [ edit ] Symmetric bilinear form [ edit ] The concept of an orthogonal basis is applicable to a vector space V {\displaystyle V} (over any field ) equipped with a symmetric bilinear form ⁠ ⟨ ⟨ ⋅ ⋅ , ⋅ ⋅ ⟩ ⟩ {\displaystyle \langle \cdot ,\cdot \rangle } ⁠ , where orthogonality of two vectors v {\displaystyle v} and w {\displaystyle w} means ⁠ ⟨ ⟨ v , w ⟩ ⟩ = 0 {\displaystyle \langle v,w\rangle =0} ⁠ . For an orthogonal basis ⁠ { e k } {\displaystyle \left\{e_{k}\right\}} ⁠ : ⟨ ⟨ e j , e k ⟩ ⟩ = { q ( e k ) j = k 0 j ≠ ≠ k , {\displaystyle \langle e_{j},e_{k}\rangle ={\begin{cases}q(e_{k})&j=k\\0&j\neq k,\end{cases}}} where q {\displaystyle q} is a quadratic form associated with ⟨ ⟨ ⋅ ⋅ , ⋅ ⋅ ⟩ ⟩ : {\displaystyle \langle \cdot ,\cdot \rangle :} q ( v ) = ⟨ ⟨ v , v ⟩ ⟩ {\displaystyle q(v)=\langle v,v\rangle } (in an inner product space, ⁠ q ( v ) = ‖ ‖ v ‖ ‖ 2 {\displaystyle q(v)=\Vert v\Vert ^{2}} ⁠ ).

Hence for an orthogonal basis ⁠ { e k } {\displaystyle \left\{e_{k}\right\}} ⁠ , ⟨ ⟨ v , w ⟩ ⟩ = ∑ ∑ k q ( e k ) v k w k , {\displaystyle \langle v,w\rangle =\sum _{k}q(e_{k})v_{k}w_{k},} where v k {\displaystyle v_{k}} and w k {\displaystyle w_{k}} are components of v {\displaystyle v} and w {\displaystyle w} in the basis.

Quadratic form [ edit ] The concept of orthogonality may be extended to a vector space over any field of characteristic not 2 equipped with a quadratic form ⁠ q ( v ) {\displaystyle q(v)} ⁠ .  Starting from the observation that, when the characteristic of the underlying field is not 2, the associated symmetric bilinear form ⟨ ⟨ v , w ⟩ ⟩ = 1 2 ( q ( v + w ) − − q ( v ) − − q ( w ) ) {\displaystyle \langle v,w\rangle ={\tfrac {1}{2}}(q(v+w)-q(v)-q(w))} allows vectors v {\displaystyle v} and w {\displaystyle w} to be defined as being orthogonal with respect to q {\displaystyle q} when ⁠ q ( v + w ) − − q ( v ) − − q ( w ) = 0 {\displaystyle q(v+w)-q(v)-q(w)=0} ⁠ .
