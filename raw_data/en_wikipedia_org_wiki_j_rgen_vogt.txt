[ 1 ] Around the same time he was on the editorial board of the periodical Proletaren .

He served one term. In the same year he also re-established the newspaper Ny Tid , and in 1946 he was chosen as editor-in-chief of the new party organ, Friheten . As such he was a member of the central committee of the Communist Party. He also served in Trondheim city council from 1945 to 1951.

[ 1 ] Vogt continued as editor-in-chief of Friheten until 1967, except for a period between 1962 and 1965, when he was political secretary of the Communist Party. Vogt had moved back to his hometown Oslo , where he served as a deputy member of the city council from 1959 to 1963. Vogt was also a member of the Schei committee , which worked from 1946 to 1961 to reduce the number of municipalities of Norway . He worked as a secretary in the Norwegian Parliament for the last years of his life, [ 1 ] and died in 1972.
