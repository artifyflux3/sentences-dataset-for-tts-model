, 2017 Ramathallus is a genus of sessile lobate alga that represents a probable stem- Rhodophyte from the Upper Statherian , 1600 Million years ago.

[ 1 ] The holotype of Ramathallus lobatus shows a cell structure with finger-like protrusions and a coating of non-cellular apatic. The cells have a dark granular material inside of them.

[ 1 ] The organism grew by apical growth and possessed pseudoparenchymatous thallus which in turn infer a possible affinity with the Florideophyceae . Many lobate protrusions radiated from the organisms centre composed out of pseudoparenchymatous tissue interpreted as "Cell fountains" made up of variably-sized cells.

Ramathallus shares a close morphological similarity with the Ediacaran genera made up of pseudoparenchymatous, lobate fossils ( Thallophyca , Thallophycoides , Paramecia and Gremiphyca ) from the Doushantuo phosphorites of China .
