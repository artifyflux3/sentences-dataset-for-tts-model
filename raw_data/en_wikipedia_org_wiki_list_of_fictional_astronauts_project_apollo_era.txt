The game (and the rest of the series) takes place in an alternate timeline that diverges from reality after World War II . As in our timeline, the United States was the first country to land humans on the Moon and did so starting in July 1969. The mission itself is slightly different to the one in reality as shown by the museum's Space Race exhibit. This fictional version of Apollo 11, known as "Valiant 11", was launched by the United States Space Administration (USSA), the timeline's version of NASA . All three astronauts on the mission were U.S. Air Force Captains, namely, Captain Richard Wade, Captain Mark Garris, and Captain Michael Hagen. The lunar module that flew them there was known as Virgo II and the date they landed on the Moon was July 16, 1969 (the same day Apollo 11 was launched in real life). The exhibit at the museum displays a replica of Virgo II which does not resemble the Apollo LM used in Apollo 11; instead it appears similar to the LK lunar module that was tested by the Soviets in the 1960s and 1970s but never carried humans to the Moon.
