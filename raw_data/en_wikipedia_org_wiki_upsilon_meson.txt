The peak at about 9.5 GeV is due to the contribution of the Upsilon meson.

flavourless meson ) formed from a bottom quark and its antiparticle .

It was discovered by the E288 experiment team, headed by Leon Lederman , at Fermilab in 1977.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] It has a lifetime of 1.21 × 10 −20 s and a mass about 9.46 GeV/ c 2 in the ground state.

Overview [ edit ] Quark structure of the Upsilon meson There are many species of bottomonium known, but the ones generated by e-e+ colliding beams (or proton-nucleus collisions decaying to →μ + μ - + X ) are the ones generally referred to as upsilon mesons.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] Thus, among the bound b b bottomonium species, the S-state [ a ] triplet [ b ] resonances are identified as upsilons, and are assigned the shorthand notations ϒ (S1), ϒ (S2), ϒ (S3), etc., [ c ] where the numbers 1, 2, 3 represent the principal quantum number n .

[ 5 ] [ d ] Alternately, the notation parenthesizing the measured mass in MeV is used, e.g.

Υ (10860).

[ 6 ] [ 7 ] In the narrow sense, "Upsilon particle" refers strictly to the Υ (1S).

[ 9 ] As clear from its quark structure, the Upsilon meson carries no charge or flavor, and has 0 isospin .

The zero spin state should have a lighter mass by about 0.1 to 1% according to quantum chromodynamics .

[ citation needed ] Discovery [ edit ] Lederman's E288 experiment team at Fermilab had made a preliminary finding of a resonance at 9.5 Gev in November 1976, but was more reticent in announcing it because earlier they had prematurely announced a 6 Gev resonance event (which they were planning to name upsilon; cf.

Oops-Leon ) with their equipment in dielectron (e+e-) mode; this find did not pan out and ultimately could not be confirmed.

[ 10 ] [ 1 ] [ 11 ] However, with their equipment converted to dimuon (+-) mode with increased sensitivity upped 100 times, they began measurement in May 1977 and clearly confirmed resonance peaks at  9.4/9.5. 10. 10.4GeV (cf.

§ Resonance states under S1, S2, S3) [ e ] [ 12 ] [ 1 ] These peaks were verified by the German team using DESY 's DORIS storage ring.

[ 8 ] [ 13 ] The upsilon was the first particle containing a bottom quark to be discovered because it is the lightest that can be produced without additional massive particles.

[ citation needed ] [ f ] Resonant states [ edit ] Υ (1S) [ edit ] Mass measured at 9460.30±0.26MeV ( Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory , Particle Data Group, 2008) [ 15 ] Lifeime of about > 10 -20 [ 17 ] calculated from measured energy width to  1.21×10 -20 s.

[ 18 ] [ 20 ] The types of decay modes are diverse, with electron pair, muon pair, tauon pair decays (all three lepton decays) each occurring at 2.5%  frequency.

[ 15 ] The short lifetime (τ) is calculable from the usual formula τ ΔE= h /2π, so in the subsequent sections, the listing of the lifetimes will be eschewed.

Υ (2S) [ edit ] Mass measured at 10.02326±0.00031GeV [ 21 ] 。 Here again, decay modes are diverse, decaying into Υ (1S) and charged pion pair, approx. 20% of the time, into Υ (1S) and neutral π pair, approx. 10%, and into lepton (e、μ、τ) pairs, about 2% each.

[ 21 ] A B-factory at SLAC 's PEP-II accelerator postponed the termination of operation by 2 months to conduct experiments starting February 2008 to generate Υ (2S) and Υ (3S) (cf. below). While the data remained to be fully analyzed, the team announced in the fall of 2008 that they discovered the spin 0 ground state bottomonium corresponding to the spin 1 Υ (1S) state. The published mass difference with Υ (1S) was 71.4 +2.3 −3.1 ±2.7MeV.

[ 22 ] Υ (3S) [ edit ] Mass measured at 10.3552±0.0005GeV [ 23 ] Again, diversely decaying into Υ(2S)+ X (such as pion pairs), approx. 10%、Υ(1S)+ X (such as pion pairs), also lepton  (μ、τ) pairs, about 2% apiece, but e + e ^ decay is quite rare.

[ 23 ] Υ (4S) [ edit ] Also called Υ (10580) とも呼ばれる。質量は、10.5794±0.0012GeV [ 24 ] 。 Nearly completely decays (>96%) into B meson pairs, almost fifty-fifty between charged pairs and uncharged pairs.

[ 24 ] Thus for B meson research, this Υ (4S) mode of resonance is of great importance, and its research has been undertaken by various B-faccories (up to c. 1999).

[ 25 ] 。 Υ (10860) [ edit ] Also called Y(5S).

[ 6 ] 。
Measured mass of 10.865±0.008GeV [ 7 ] Main decay mode into B meson pairs only or with 1 or 2 pions, about 60% of the time, and into charm B meson pairs, about 20% of the time.

[ 7 ] In this 2008 data report, the strange B meson ( B s ) decay is also tentatively reported.

[ g ] [ 7 ] The energy threshold was also met by Japan's [[KEKB (accelerator)]KEKB]] accelerator whose "Belle" B factory experiment also contemplated the strange B meson decay.

[ 6 ] The successes of Y(4S) research has led to the advent of studying Y(5S) at the higher lumonsities From around 2008.

[ 6 ] Υ (11020) [ edit ] Mass measured at 11.019±0.008GeV.

[ 26 ] The decay modes are unclear except a small percentage of electron pair decays, as of 2008.

[ 26 ] 。 See also [ edit ] Oops-Leon , an erroneously-claimed discovery of a similar particle at a lower mass in 1976.

The ϕ particle is the analogous state made from strange quarks .

The J/ψ particle is the analogous state made from charm quarks .

List of mesons Explanatory notes [ edit ] ^ The S-state is orbital angular momentum L =0.

^ With total spin S =1, the multiplicity 2 S +1 =3, i.e., a triplet.

^ Or Upsilon (S1), written out.

^ Sudaresan explains in terms of the standard spectral notation ( term symbol ) expressed as 2 S + 1 L J {\displaystyle ^{2S+1}L_{J}} where S is total spin, 2 S +1 the multiplicity =3 (triplet),  the orbital angular momentum L =0 represented as "S" for S-state, and J the total angular momentum quantum number =1.

^ They referred to the 3 peaks at the time by the shorthand Υ , Υ (upsilon prime), and Υ (upsilon double prime).

[ 8 ] ^ Also, the Lederman team concentrated on lepton beam experiments (dielectron or dimuon decay), even reconfirming the J/ψ found at SLAC . Other teams preferred to do hadron beams at the time "the techiques needed to do experiments with hadron beams simply didn't exist", recalled  Fermilab physicist Joseph Lach.
