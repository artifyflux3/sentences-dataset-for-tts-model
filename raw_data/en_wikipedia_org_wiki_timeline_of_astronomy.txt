This is a **timeline of astronomy**. It covers ancient, medieval, Renaissance-era, and finally modern astronomy.

[Mayan astronomers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_astronomy "Maya astronomy") discover an 18.7-year cycle in the rising and setting of the [Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon "Moon"). From this they created the first [almanacs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almanac "Almanac")– tables of the movements of the Sun, Moon, and planets for the use in [astrology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrology "Astrology"). In 6th century BC Greece, this was also discovered

[Thales of Miletus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thales_of_Miletus "Thales of Miletus") is said to have predicted a [solar eclipse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse_of_Thales "Eclipse of Thales"). He said "it will happen today."

[Anaxagoras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaxagoras "Anaxagoras") produced a correct explanation for [eclipses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse "Eclipse") and then described the Sun as a fiery mass larger than the [Peloponnese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peloponnese "Peloponnese"), as well as attempting to explain [rainbows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbows "Rainbows") and [meteors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteors "Meteors"). He was the first to explain that the Moon shines due to reflected light from the Sun.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_astronomy#cite_note-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_astronomy#cite_note-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_astronomy#cite_note-3)

Around this date, Babylonians use the [zodiac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zodiac "Zodiac") to divide the heavens [sexagesimally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexagesimal "Sexagesimal") into twelve equal segments of thirty degrees each, the better to record and communicate information about the position of celestial bodies.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_astronomy#cite_note-4)

[Plato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato "Plato"), a Greek philosopher, founds a school (the [Platonic Academy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_Academy "Platonic Academy")) that will influence the next 2000 years. Borrowing and expanding from [Pythagoreanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoreanism "Pythagoreanism"), it promotes the idea that everything in the universe moves in harmony and that the Sun, Moon, and planets move around Earth in perfect circles.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_astronomy#cite_note-5)

[Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle "Aristotle"), a Greek polymath, described motion of physical objects based on their affinity with one of four [classical elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_element "Classical element"): earth, water, air, or fire.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_astronomy#cite_note-6)

The astronomer [Shi Shen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shi_Shen "Shi Shen") is believed to have cataloged 809 stars in 122 constellations, and he also made the earliest known observation of sunspots.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_astronomy#cite_note-7)

[Aristarchus of Samos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristarchus_of_Samos "Aristarchus of Samos") proposes [heliocentrism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism "Heliocentrism") as an alternative to the Earth-centered universe. His heliocentric model places the Sun at its center, with Earth as just one planet orbiting it. However, there were only a few people who took the theory seriously.

The earliest recorded sighting of [Halley's Comet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halley%27s_Comet "Halley's Comet") is made by Chinese astronomers. Their records of the comet's movement allow astronomers today to predict accurately how the comet's orbit changes over the centuries.

[Hipparchus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hipparchus "Hipparchus") incidentally discovered of the precession of the equinoxes.

[Vitruvius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitruvius "Vitruvius") explains that an object’s fall speed depends on their [specific gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_gravity "Specific gravity").[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_astronomy#cite_note-8)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_astronomy#cite_note-9)[_[failed verification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability "Wikipedia:Verifiability")_]

[Ptolemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy "Ptolemy") publishes his [star catalogue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_catalogue "Star catalogue"), listing 48 [constellations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation "Constellation") and endorses the [geocentric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentric "Geocentric") (Earth-centered) view of the universe. His views go unquestioned for nearly 1500 years in Europe and are passed down to Arabic and medieval European astronomers in his book the [Almagest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almagest "Almagest"). He also proposed astronomical calculation of the sidereal revolution of planets.

The Hindu cosmological time cycles explained in the _[Surya Siddhanta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surya\_Siddhanta "Surya Siddhanta")_, give the average length of the sidereal year (the length of the Earth's revolution around the Sun) as 365.2563627 days, which is only 1.4 seconds longer than the modern value of 365.256363004 days.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_astronomy#cite_note-10) This remains the most accurate estimate for the length of the sidereal year anywhere in the world for over a thousand years.

Indian mathematician-astronomer [Aryabhata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata "Aryabhata"), in his _[Aryabhatiya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhatiya "Aryabhatiya")_ first explain the [elliptical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipse "Ellipse") model of the planets, where the planets spin on their [axis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_of_rotation "Axis of rotation") and follow elliptical orbits, the Sun and the Moon revolve around the Earth in [epicycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicycles "Epicycles"). He also writes that the planets and the Moon do not have their own light but reflect the light of the Sun and that the Earth rotates on its axis causing day and night and also that the Sun rotates around the Earth causing years.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_astronomy#cite_note-11)

Indian mathematician-astronomer [Brahmagupta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmagupta "Brahmagupta"), in his _[Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Br%C4%81hmasphu%E1%B9%ADasiddh%C4%81nta "Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta")_, first recognizes gravity as a force of attraction. He gives methods for calculations of the motions and places of various planets, their rising and setting, conjunctions, and calculations of the solar and lunar eclipses.

The [Sanskrit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit "Sanskrit") works of [Aryabhata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata "Aryabhata") and [Brahmagupta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmagupta "Brahmagupta"), along with the Sanskrit text _[Surya Siddhanta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surya\_Siddhanta "Surya Siddhanta")_, are translated into [Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic "Arabic"), introducing [Arabic astronomers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_astronomy "Islamic astronomy") to [Indian astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_astronomy "Indian astronomy").

[Muḥammad ibn Ibrāhīm al-Fazārī](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mu%E1%B8%A5ammad_ibn_Ibr%C4%81h%C4%ABm_al-Faz%C4%81r%C4%AB "Muḥammad ibn Ibrāhīm al-Fazārī") and [Yaʿqūb ibn Ṭāriq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ya%CA%BFq%C5%ABb_ibn_%E1%B9%AC%C4%81riq "Yaʿqūb ibn Ṭāriq") translate the _[Surya Siddhanta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surya\_Siddhanta "Surya Siddhanta")_ and _[Brahmasphutasiddhanta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmasphutasiddhanta "Brahmasphutasiddhanta")_, and compile them as the _Zij al-Sindhind_, the first [Zij](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zij "Zij") treatise.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_astronomy#cite_note-12)

The first major [Arabic work of astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_astronomy "Islamic astronomy") is the _Zij al-Sindh_ by [Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_ibn_Musa_al-Khwarizmi "Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi"). The work contains tables for the movements of the Sun, the Moon, and the five planets known at the time. The work is significant as it introduced Ptolemaic concepts into Islamic sciences. This work also marks the turning point in Arabic astronomy. Hitherto, Arabic astronomers had adopted a primarily research approach to the field, translating works of others and learning already discovered knowledge. Al-Khwarizmi's work marked the beginning of nontraditional methods of study and calculations.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_astronomy#cite_note-13)

[al-Farghani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Farghani "Al-Farghani") wrote _Kitab fi Jawani_ ("_A compendium of the science of stars_"). The book primarily gave a summary of Ptolemic cosmography. However, it also corrected Ptolemy based on findings of earlier Arab astronomers. Al-Farghani gave revised values for the obliquity of the ecliptic, the precessional movement of the [apogees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apogee "Apogee") of the Sun and the Moon, and the circumference of the Earth. The books were widely circulated through the Muslim world and even translated into [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin "Latin").[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_astronomy#cite_note-14)

The earliest surviving [astrolabe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrolabe "Astrolabe") is constructed by astronomer [Nastulus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nastulus "Nastulus").[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_astronomy#cite_note-15)

[Al-Biruni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Biruni "Al-Biruni") discussed the Indian geocentric theories of [Aryabhata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata "Aryabhata"), [Brahmagupta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmagupta "Brahmagupta") and [Varāhamihira](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Var%C4%81hamihira "Varāhamihira") in his _Ta'rikh al-Hind_ (_Indica_ in Latin). Biruni stated that the followers of Aryabhata consider the Earth to be at the center. In fact, Biruni casually stated that this does not create any mathematical problems.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_astronomy#cite_note-16)

[Al-Sijzi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Sijzi "Al-Sijzi"), a contemporary of [Al-Biruni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Biruni "Al-Biruni"), defended the theory that Earth rotates on its axis.

Chinese astronomers record the sudden appearance of a [bright star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SN_1054 "SN 1054"). Native-American rock carvings also show the brilliant star close to the Moon. This star is the Crab [supernova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova "Supernova") exploding.

Abu Ubayd al-Juzjani published the _Tarik al-Aflak_. In his work, he indicated the so-called "[equant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equant "Equant")" problem of the [Ptolemic model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentrism "Geocentrism"). Al-Juzjani even proposed a solution to the problem. In [al-Andalus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Andalus "Al-Andalus"), the anonymous work _al-Istidrak ala Batlamyus_ (meaning "Recapitulation regarding Ptolemy"), included a list of objections to the Ptolemic astronomy.

One of the most important works in the period was _Al-Shukuk ala Batlamyus_ ("_Doubts on Ptolemy_"). In this, the author summed up the inconsistencies of the Ptolemic models. Many astronomers took up the challenge posed in this work, namely to develop alternate models that evaded such errors.

[Islamic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_astronomy "Islamic astronomy") and [Indian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_astronomy "Indian astronomy") astronomical works (including _Aryabhatiya_ and _Brahma-Sphuta-Siddhanta_) are translated into Latin in [Córdoba, Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%B3rdoba,_Spain "Córdoba, Spain") in 1126, introducing European astronomers to Islamic and Indian astronomy.

Indian mathematician-astronomer [Bhāskara II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bh%C4%81skara_II "Bhāskara II"), in his _Siddhanta Shiromani_, calculates the [longitudes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude "Longitude") and [latitudes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude "Latitude") of the planets, lunar and solar eclipses, risings and settings, the Moon's [lunar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon "Moon")[crescent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crescent "Crescent"), [syzygies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syzygy_(astronomy) "Syzygy (astronomy)"), and conjunctions of the planets with each other and with the [fixed stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_stars "Fixed stars"), and explains the three problems of [diurnal rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diurnal_motion "Diurnal motion"). He also calculates the planetary [mean motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_motion "Mean motion"), ellipses, first visibilities of the planets, the lunar crescent, the seasons, and the length of the Earth's revolution around the Sun to 9 decimal places.

[Nur ad-Din al-Bitruji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nur_ad-Din_al-Bitruji "Nur ad-Din al-Bitruji") proposed an alternative geocentric system to Ptolemy's. He also declared the Ptolemaic system as mathematical, and not physical. His alternative system spread through most of Europe during the 13th century, with debates and refutations of his ideas continued to the 16th century.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_astronomy#cite_note-BatrujiDSB-17)[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_astronomy#cite_note-18)

[Mu'ayyad al-Din al-Urdi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mu%27ayyad_al-Din_al-Urdi "Mu'ayyad al-Din al-Urdi") develops the Urdi lemma, which is later used in the [Copernican heliocentric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copernican_heliocentrism "Copernican heliocentrism") model.

[Nasir al-Din al-Tusi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasir_al-Din_al-Tusi "Nasir al-Din al-Tusi") resolved significant problems in the Ptolemaic system by developing the [Tusi-couple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tusi-couple "Tusi-couple") as an alternative to the physically problematic [equant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equant "Equant") introduced by Ptolemy.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_astronomy#cite_note-Gill-19) His Tusi-couple is later used in the Copernican model.

Tusi's student [Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qutb_al-Din_al-Shirazi "Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi"), in his _The Limit of Accomplishment concerning Knowledge of the Heavens_, discusses the possibility of heliocentrism.

[Najm al-Din al-Qazwini al-Katibi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Najm_al-Din_al-Qazwini_al-Katibi "Najm al-Din al-Qazwini al-Katibi"), who also worked at the [Maraghah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maraghah "Maraghah") observatory, in his _Hikmat al-'Ain_, wrote an argument for a heliocentric model, though he later abandoned the idea.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

[Ibn al-Shatir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_al-Shatir "Ibn al-Shatir") (1304–1375), in his _A Final Inquiry Concerning the Rectification of Planetary Theory_, eliminated the need for an equant by introducing an extra epicycle, departing from the Ptolemaic system in a way very similar to what [Copernicus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copernicus "Copernicus") later also did. Ibn al-Shatir proposed a system that was only approximately geocentric, rather than exactly so, having demonstrated [trigonometrically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometry "Trigonometry") that the Earth was not the exact center of the universe. His rectification is later used in the Copernican model.

Renaissance and Age of Enlightenment
------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Timeline_of_astronomy&action=edit&section=32 "Edit section: Renaissance and Age of Enlightenment")]

[Nilakantha Somayaji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nilakantha_Somayaji "Nilakantha Somayaji") proposes a model very similar to the [Tychonic system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tychonic_system "Tychonic system") and his equation for the centre for the planets Mercury and Venus were the most accurate until [Johannes Kepler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Kepler "Johannes Kepler")

[Nicolaus Copernicus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Copernicus "Nicolaus Copernicus") publishes _[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De\_revolutionibus\_orbium\_coelestium "De revolutionibus orbium coelestium")_ containing his theory that Earth travels around the Sun. However, he complicates his theory by retaining Plato's perfect circular orbits of the planets.

A brilliant supernova ([SN 1572](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SN_1572 "SN 1572") – thought at the time to be a comet) is observed by [Tycho Brahe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tycho_Brahe "Tycho Brahe"), who proves that it is traveling beyond Earth's atmosphere and therefore provides the first evidence that the heavens can change.

Dutch eyeglass maker [Hans Lippershey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Lippershey "Hans Lippershey") tries to patent a [refracting telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refracting_telescope "Refracting telescope") (the first historical record of one). The invention spreads rapidly across Europe, as scientists make their own instruments. Their discoveries begin a revolution in astronomy.

[Johannes Kepler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Kepler "Johannes Kepler") publishes his _[New Astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomia\_nova "Astronomia nova")_. In this and later works, he announces his [three laws of planetary motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_laws_of_planetary_motion "Kepler's laws of planetary motion"), replacing the circular orbits of Plato with [elliptical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipse "Ellipse") ones. [Almanacs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almanac "Almanac") based on Johannes' laws prove to be highly accurate.

[Galileo Galilei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei "Galileo Galilei") publishes _[Sidereus Nuncius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidereus\_Nuncius "Sidereus Nuncius")_ describing the findings of his observations with the telescope he built. These include spots on the Sun, craters on the Moon, and four satellites of Jupiter. Proving that not everything orbits Earth, he promotes the Copernican view of a Sun-centered universe.

As the power and the quality of the telescopes increase, [Christiaan Huygens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christiaan_Huygens "Christiaan Huygens") studies Saturn and discovers its largest satellite, Titan. He also explains Saturn's appearance, suggesting the planet is surrounded by a thin ring.

Scottish astronomer [James Gregory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Gregory_(mathematician) "James Gregory (mathematician)") describes his "[gregorian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_telescope "Gregorian telescope")" [reflecting telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflecting_telescope "Reflecting telescope"), using [parabolic mirrors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabolic_reflector "Parabolic reflector") instead of lenses to reduce [chromatic aberration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_aberration "Chromatic aberration") and [spherical aberration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_aberration "Spherical aberration"), but is unable to build one.

Isaac Newton builds the first [reflecting telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflecting_telescope "Reflecting telescope"), his [Newtonian telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newtonian_telescope "Newtonian telescope").

[Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton") publishes his first copy of the book _Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica_, establishing the theory of gravitation and laws of motion. The _Principia_ explains Kepler's laws of planetary motion and allows astronomers to understand the forces acting between the Sun, the planets, and their moons.

[Edmond Halley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmond_Halley "Edmond Halley") calculates that the comets recorded at 76-year intervals from 1456 to 1682 are one and the same. He predicts that the comet will return again in 1758. When it reappears as expected, the comet is named in his honor.

French astronomer [Nicolas de Lacaille](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_de_Lacaille "Nicolas de Lacaille") sails to southern oceans and begins work compiling a catalog of more than 10,000 stars in the southern sky. Although Halley and others have observed from the Southern Hemisphere before, Lacaille's star catalog is the first comprehensive one of the southern sky.

Amateur astronomer [William Herschel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Herschel "William Herschel") discovers the planet Uranus, although he at first mistakes it for a comet. Uranus is the first planet to be discovered beyond Saturn, which was thought to be the most distant planet in ancient times.

[Charles Messier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Messier "Charles Messier") publishes his catalog of star clusters and nebulas. Messier draws up the list to prevent these objects from being identified as comets. However, it soon becomes a standard reference for the study of star clusters and nebulas and is still in use today.

William Herschel splits sunlight through a prism and with a thermometer, measures the energy given out by different colours. He notices a sudden increase in energy beyond the red end of the [spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum "Spectrum"), discovering invisible infrared and laying the foundations of spectroscopy.

Italian astronomer [Giuseppe Piazzi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Piazzi "Giuseppe Piazzi") discovers what appears to be a new planet orbiting between Mars and Jupiter, and names it [Ceres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceres_(dwarf_planet) "Ceres (dwarf planet)"). [William Herschel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Herschel "William Herschel") proves it is a very small object, calculating it to be only 320 km in diameter, and not a planet. He proposes the name asteroid, and soon other similar bodies are being found. We now know that Ceres is 932 km in diameter, and is now considered to be a dwarf planet.

[Joseph von Fraunhofer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_von_Fraunhofer "Joseph von Fraunhofer") builds the first accurate spectrometer and uses it to study the spectrum of the Sun's light. He discovers and maps hundreds of fine dark lines crossing the solar spectrum. In 1859 these lines are linked to chemical elements in the Sun's atmosphere. Spectroscopy becomes a method for studying what stars are made of.

[Friedrich Bessel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Bessel "Friedrich Bessel") successfully uses the method of stellar parallax, the effect of Earth's annual movement around the Sun, to calculate the distance to [61 Cygni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/61_Cygni "61 Cygni"), the first star other than the Sun to have its distance from Earth measured. Bessel's is a truly accurate measurement of stellar positions, and the parallax technique establishes a framework for measuring the scale of the universe.

German amateur astronomer [Heinrich Schwabe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Schwabe "Heinrich Schwabe"), who had been studying the [Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun "Sun") for the past 17 years, announces his discovery of a regular cycle in sunspot numbers - the first clue to the Sun's internal structure.

Irish astronomer [William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Parsons,_3rd_Earl_of_Rosse "William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse") completes the first of the world's [great telescopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leviathan_of_Parsonstown "Leviathan of Parsonstown"), with a 180-cm mirror. He uses it to study and draw the structure of nebulas, and within a few months discovers the spiral structure of the [Whirlpool Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whirlpool_Galaxy "Whirlpool Galaxy").

French physicists [Jean Foucault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Foucault "Jean Foucault") and [Armand Fizeau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armand_Fizeau "Armand Fizeau") take the first detailed photographs of the Sun's surface through a telescope - the birth of scientific astrophotography. Within five years, astronomers produce the first detailed photographs of the Moon. Early film is not sensitive enough to image stars.

A new planet, [Neptune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neptune "Neptune"), is identified by German astronomer [Johann Gottfried Galle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Gottfried_Galle "Johann Gottfried Galle") while searching in the position suggested by [Urbain Le Verrier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urbain_Le_Verrier "Urbain Le Verrier"). Le Verrier has calculated the position and size of the planet from the effects of its gravitational pull on the orbit of Uranus. An English mathematician, [John Couch Adams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Couch_Adams "John Couch Adams"), also made a similar calculation a year earlier.

Astronomers notice a new bright emission line in the spectrum of the Sun's atmosphere during an eclipse. The emission line is caused by an element's giving out light, and British astronomer [Norman Lockyer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Lockyer "Norman Lockyer") concludes that it is an element unknown on Earth. He calls it [helium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium "Helium"), from the Greek word for the Sun. Nearly 30 years later, helium is found on Earth.

An American astronomer [Henry Draper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Draper "Henry Draper") takes the first photograph of the spectrum of a star (Vega), showing absorption lines that reveal its chemical makeup. Astronomers begin to see that spectroscopy is the key to understanding how stars evolve. [William Huggins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Huggins "William Huggins") uses absorption lines to measure the redshifts of stars, which give the first indication of how fast stars are moving.

[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konstantin_Tsiolkovsky "Konstantin Tsiolkovsky") publishes his first article on the possibility of space flight. His greatest discovery is that a rocket, unlike other forms of propulsion, will work in a vacuum. He also outlines the principle of a multistage launch vehicle.

A comprehensive survey of stars, the _[Henry Draper Catalogue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry\_Draper\_Catalogue "Henry Draper Catalogue")_, is published. In the catalog, [Annie Jump Cannon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_Jump_Cannon "Annie Jump Cannon") proposes a sequence of classifying stars by the absorption lines in their spectra, which is still in use today.

[Ejnar Hertzsprung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejnar_Hertzsprung "Ejnar Hertzsprung") establishes the standard for measuring the true brightness of a star. He shows that there is a relationship between color and absolute magnitude for 90% of the stars in the Milky Way Galaxy. In 1913, [Henry Norris Russell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Norris_Russell "Henry Norris Russell") published a diagram that shows this relationship. Although astronomers agree that the diagram shows the sequence in which stars evolve, they argue about which way the sequence progresses. [Arthur Eddington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Eddington "Arthur Eddington") finally settles the controversy in 1924.

[Williamina Fleming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williamina_Fleming "Williamina Fleming") publishes her discovery of [white dwarf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_dwarf "White dwarf") stars.

[Henrietta Swan Leavitt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Swan_Leavitt "Henrietta Swan Leavitt") discovers the [period-luminosity relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Period-luminosity_relation "Period-luminosity relation") for [Cepheid variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cepheid_variable "Cepheid variable"), where the intrinsic brightness of a star is proportional to its luminosity oscillation period. It opened a whole new branch of possibilities of measuring distances on the universe, and this discovery was the basis for the work done by [Edwin Hubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble "Edwin Hubble") on extragalactic astronomy.

German physicist [Karl Schwarzschild](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Schwarzschild "Karl Schwarzschild") uses [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein")'s theory of general relativity to lay the groundwork for black hole theory. He suggests that if any star collapse to a certain size or smaller, its gravity will be so strong that no form of radiation will escape from it.

[Edwin Hubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble "Edwin Hubble") discovers a [Cepheid variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cepheid_variable "Cepheid variable") star in the "Andromeda Nebula" and proves that Andromeda and other nebulas are galaxies far beyond our own. By 1925, he produces a classification system for galaxies.

[Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cecilia_Payne-Gaposchkin "Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin") discovers that [hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen "Hydrogen") is the most abundant element in the Sun's atmosphere, and accordingly, the most abundant element in the universe by relating the spectral classes of stars to their actual temperatures and by applying the ionization theory developed by Indian physicist [Meghnad Saha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghnad_Saha "Meghnad Saha"). This opens the path for the study of stellar atmospheres and chemical abundances, contributing to understand the chemical evolution of the universe.

[Robert Goddard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Goddard "Robert Goddard") launches the first rocket powered by liquid fuel. He also demonstrates that a rocket can work in a vacuum. His later rockets break the sound barrier for the first time.

[Edwin Hubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble "Edwin Hubble") discovered that the universe is expanding and that the farther away a galaxy is, the faster it is moving away from us. Two years later, [Georges Lemaître](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Lema%C3%AEtre "Georges Lemaître") suggests that the expansion can be traced to an initial "Big Bang".

By applying new ideas from subatomic physics, [Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subrahmanyan_Chandrasekhar "Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar") predicts that the atoms in a white dwarf star of more than 1.44 solar masses will disintegrate, causing the star to collapse violently. In 1933, [Walter Baade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Baade "Walter Baade") and [Fritz Zwicky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_Zwicky "Fritz Zwicky") describe the neutron star that results from this collapse, causing a supernova explosion.

[Clyde Tombaugh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clyde_Tombaugh "Clyde Tombaugh") discovers the dwarf planet [Pluto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluto "Pluto") at the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona. The object is so faint and moving so slowly that he has to compare photos taken several nights apart.

[Karl Jansky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Jansky "Karl Jansky") detects the first radio waves coming from space. In 1942, radio waves from the Sun are detected. Seven years later radio astronomers identify the first distant source – the Crab Nebula, and the galaxies Centaurus A and M87.

German physicist [Hans Bethe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Bethe "Hans Bethe") explains how stars generate energy. He outlines a series of nuclear fusion reactions that turn hydrogen into helium and release enormous amounts of energy in a star's core. These reactions use the star's hydrogen very slowly, allowing it to burn for billions of years.

A team of German scientists led by [Wernher von Braun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wernher_von_Braun "Wernher von Braun") develops the [V-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V-2 "V-2"), the first rocket-powered ballistic missile. Scientists and engineers from Braun's team were captured at the end of [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II") and drafted into the American and Soviet rocket programs.

The US sent up the first [animals in space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animals_in_space "Animals in space") although not into orbit, through a [V-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V-2 "V-2") rocket launched from [White Sands Missile Range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Sands_Missile_Range "White Sands Missile Range"), [New Mexico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico "New Mexico").

[Arno Penzias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arno_Penzias "Arno Penzias") and [Robert Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Woodrow_Wilson "Robert Woodrow Wilson") announce the discovery of a weak radio signal coming from all parts of the sky. Scientists figure out that this must be emitted by an object at a temperature of −270°C. Soon it is recognized as the remnant of the very hot radiation from the Big Bang that created the universe 13 billion years ago, see [Cosmic microwave background](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background "Cosmic microwave background").

Soviet [Luna 9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luna_9 "Luna 9") probe makes the first successful soft landing on the Moon in January, while the US lands the far more complex Surveyor missions, which follows up to NASA's Ranger series of crash-landers, scout sites for possible crewed landings.

[Apollo 11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11 "Apollo 11") is followed by five further landing missions, three carrying a sophisticated [Lunar Roving Vehicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Roving_Vehicle "Lunar Roving Vehicle").

The [Uhuru satellite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uhuru_(satellite) "Uhuru (satellite)"), designed to map the sky at X-ray wavelengths, is launched by NASA. The existence of X-rays from the Sun and a few other stars has already been found using rocket-launched experiments, but Uhuru charts more than 300 X-ray sources, including several possible black holes.

The USSR launches its first space station [Salyut 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salyut_1 "Salyut 1") into orbit. It is followed by a series of stations, culminating with Mir in 1986. A permanent platform in orbit allows cosmonauts to carry out serious research and to set a series of new duration records for spaceflight.
