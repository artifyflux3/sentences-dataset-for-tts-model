For real-valued functions , it is the Laplace transform of a Stieltjes measure , however it is often defined for functions with values in a Banach space . It is useful in a number of areas of mathematics , including functional analysis , and certain areas of theoretical and applied probability .

Real-valued functions [ edit ] The Laplace–Stieltjes transform of a real-valued function g is given by a Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral of the form ∫ ∫ e − − s x d g ( x ) {\displaystyle \int e^{-sx}\,dg(x)} for s a complex number . As with the usual Laplace transform, one gets a slightly different transform depending on the domain of integration, and for the integral to be defined, one also needs to require that g be of bounded variation on the region of integration. The most common are: The bilateral (or two-sided) Laplace–Stieltjes transform is given by { L ∗ ∗ g } ( s ) = ∫ ∫ − − ∞ ∞ ∞ ∞ e − − s x d g ( x ) .

{\displaystyle \{{\mathcal {L}}^{*}g\}(s)=\int _{-\infty }^{\infty }e^{-sx}\,dg(x).} The unilateral (one-sided) Laplace–Stieltjes transform is given by { L ∗ ∗ g } ( s ) = lim ε ε → → 0 + ∫ ∫ − − ε ε ∞ ∞ e − − s x d g ( x ) .

{\displaystyle \{{\mathcal {L}}^{*}g\}(s)=\lim _{\varepsilon \to 0^{+}}\int _{-\varepsilon }^{\infty }e^{-sx}\,dg(x).} The limit is necessary to ensure the transform captures a possible jump in g ( x ) at x = 0 , as is needed to make sense of the Laplace transform of the Dirac delta function .

More general transforms can be considered by integrating over a contour in the complex plane ; see Zhavrid 2001 .

The Laplace–Stieltjes transform in the case of a scalar-valued function is thus seen to be a special case of the Laplace transform of a Stieltjes measure . To wit, L ∗ ∗ g = L ( d g ) .

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}^{*}g={\mathcal {L}}(dg).} In particular, it shares many properties with the usual Laplace transform. For instance, the convolution theorem holds: { L ∗ ∗ ( g ∗ ∗ h ) } ( s ) = { L ∗ ∗ g } ( s ) { L ∗ ∗ h } ( s ) .

{\displaystyle \{{\mathcal {L}}^{*}(g*h)\}(s)=\{{\mathcal {L}}^{*}g\}(s)\{{\mathcal {L}}^{*}h\}(s).} Often only real values of the variable s are considered, although if the integral exists as a proper Lebesgue integral for a given real value s = σ , then it also exists for all complex s with re( s ) ≥ σ .

The Laplace–Stieltjes transform appears naturally in the following context. If X is a random variable with cumulative distribution function F , then the Laplace–Stieltjes transform is given by the expectation : { L ∗ ∗ F } ( s ) = E [ e − − s X ] .

{\displaystyle \{{\mathcal {L}}^{*}F\}(s)=\mathrm {E} \left[e^{-sX}\right].} The Laplace-Stieltjes transform of a real random variable's cumulative distribution function is therefore equal to the random variable's moment-generating function , but with the sign of the argument reversed.

Vector measures [ edit ] Whereas the Laplace–Stieltjes transform of a real-valued function is a special case of the Laplace transform of a measure applied to the associated Stieltjes measure, the conventional Laplace transform cannot handle vector measures : measures with values in a Banach space . These are, however, important in connection with the study of semigroups that arise in partial differential equations , harmonic analysis , and probability theory . The most important semigroups are, respectively, the heat semigroup , Riemann-Liouville semigroup , and Brownian motion and other infinitely divisible processes .

Let g be a function from [0,∞) to a Banach space X of strongly bounded variation over every finite interval. This means that, for every fixed subinterval [0, T ] one has sup ∑ ∑ i ‖ g ( t i ) − − g ( t i + 1 ) ‖ X < ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \sup \sum _{i}\left\|g(t_{i})-g(t_{i+1})\right\|_{X}<\infty } where the supremum is taken over all partitions of [0, T ] 0 = t 0 < t 1 < ⋯ ⋯ < t n = T .

{\displaystyle 0=t_{0}<t_{1}<\cdots <t_{n}=T.} The Stieltjes integral with respect to the vector measure dg ∫ ∫ 0 T e − − s t d g ( t ) {\displaystyle \int _{0}^{T}e^{-st}dg(t)} is defined as a Riemann–Stieltjes integral . Indeed, if π is the tagged partition of the interval [0, T ] with subdivision 0 = t 0 ≤ t 1 ≤ ... ≤ t n = T , distinguished points τ τ i ∈ ∈ [ t i , t i + 1 ] {\displaystyle \tau _{i}\in [t_{i},t_{i+1}]} and mesh size | π π | = max | t i − − t i + 1 | , {\displaystyle |\pi |=\max \left|t_{i}-t_{i+1}\right|,} the Riemann–Stieltjes integral is defined as the value of the limit lim | π π | → → 0 ∑ ∑ i = 0 n − − 1 e − − s τ τ i [ g ( t i + 1 ) − − g ( t i ) ] {\displaystyle \lim _{|\pi |\to 0}\sum _{i=0}^{n-1}e^{-s\tau _{i}}\left[g(t_{i+1})-g(t_{i})\right]} taken in the topology on X . The hypothesis of strong bounded variation guarantees convergence.

If in the topology of X the limit lim T → → ∞ ∞ ∫ ∫ 0 T e − − s t d g ( t ) {\displaystyle \lim _{T\to \infty }\int _{0}^{T}e^{-st}dg(t)} exists, then the value of this limit is the Laplace–Stieltjes transform of g .

Related transforms [ edit ] The Laplace–Stieltjes transform is closely related to other integral transforms , including the Fourier transform and the Laplace transform . In particular, note the following: If g has derivative g' then the Laplace–Stieltjes transform of g is the Laplace transform of g′ .

{ L ∗ ∗ g } ( s ) = { L g ′ } ( s ) , {\displaystyle \{{\mathcal {L}}^{*}g\}(s)=\{{\mathcal {L}}g'\}(s),} We can obtain the Fourier–Stieltjes transform of g (and, by the above note, the Fourier transform of g′ ) by { F ∗ ∗ g } ( s ) = { L ∗ ∗ g } ( i s ) , s ∈ ∈ R .

{\displaystyle \{{\mathcal {F}}^{*}g\}(s)=\{{\mathcal {L}}^{*}g\}(is),\qquad s\in \mathbb {R} .} Probability distributions [ edit ] If X is a continuous random variable with cumulative distribution function F ( t ) then moments of X can be computed using [ 1 ] E ⁡ ⁡ [ X n ] = ( − − 1 ) n d n { L ∗ ∗ F } ( s ) d s n | s = 0 .

{\displaystyle \operatorname {E} [X^{n}]=(-1)^{n}\left.{\frac {d^{n}\{{\mathcal {L}}^{*}F\}(s)}{ds^{n}}}\right|_{s=0}.} Exponential distribution [ edit ] For an exponentially distributed random variable Y with rate parameter λ the LST is, Y ~ ~ ( s ) = { L ∗ ∗ F Y } ( s ) = ∫ ∫ 0 ∞ ∞ e − − s t λ λ e − − λ λ t d t = λ λ λ λ + s {\displaystyle {\widetilde {Y}}(s)=\{{\mathcal {L}}^{*}F_{Y}\}(s)=\int _{0}^{\infty }e^{-st}\lambda e^{-\lambda t}dt={\frac {\lambda }{\lambda +s}}} from which the first three moments can be computed as 1/ λ , 2/ λ 2 and 6/ λ 3 .

Erlang distribution [ edit ] For Z with Erlang distribution (which is the sum of n exponential distributions) we use the fact that the probability distribution of the sum of independent random variables is equal to the convolution of their probability distributions . So if Z = Y 1 + ⋯ ⋯ + Y n {\displaystyle Z=Y_{1}+\cdots +Y_{n}} with the Y i independent then Z ~ ~ ( s ) = Y ~ ~ 1 ( s ) ⋯ ⋯ Y ~ ~ n ( s ) {\displaystyle {\widetilde {Z}}(s)={\widetilde {Y}}_{1}(s)\cdots {\widetilde {Y}}_{n}(s)} therefore in the case where Z has an Erlang distribution, Z ~ ~ ( s ) = ( λ λ λ λ + s ) n .

{\displaystyle {\widetilde {Z}}(s)=\left({\frac {\lambda }{\lambda +s}}\right)^{n}.} Uniform distribution [ edit ] For U with uniform distribution on the interval ( a , b ), the transform is given by U ~ ~ ( s ) = ∫ ∫ a b e − − s t 1 b − − a d t = e − − s a − − e − − s b s ( b − − a ) .

{\displaystyle {\widetilde {U}}(s)=\int _{a}^{b}e^{-st}{\frac {1}{b-a}}dt={\frac {e^{-sa}-e^{-sb}}{s(b-a)}}.} References [ edit ] ^ Harchol-Balter, M.
