On public demand Gen. Ali Saibou held multiparty elections in 1993 and soon democracy came into effect in 1993. However, political unrest was caused by Col. Ibrahim Bare who staged a coup in 1996, but he later died in a counter insurgency operations by officers of the military establishment in 1999. This was followed by fresh elections for a democratic rule, and Mamadou Tandja assumed power in December 1999. Tandja, who won the elections in 2004 and in 2009, wanted to bring about a constitutional amendment to extend his tenure as president. However, in February 2010, he was removed from the post of the president in a coup engineered by the military and the constitution was annulled. Soon after, in 2011, elections were held and Mahamadou Issoufou got elected as the president and was sworn in April 2011.

[ 1 ] Niger's problem with rebellious groups continued during 2007 and 2008. Rebellion was controlled. However, its security problems with its neighbors such as Libya , Nigeria and Mali have been a cause for concern.

[ 8 ] Natural hazards [ edit ] Main article: Sahel drought The Sahel region is a belt up to 1,000 km wide that spans Africa from the Atlantic Ocean to the Red Sea Recurring droughts are a serious challenge for Niger.

[ 9 ] The 2012 Sahel drought , along with failed crops, insect plagues, high food prices and conflicts is currently affecting Niger causing a hunger crisis.

[ 10 ] Many families in Niger, still recovering from the 2010 Sahel famine , are being affected by the 2012 Sahel drought.

[ 11 ] The 2005–06 Niger food crisis created a severe, but localized food security crisis in the regions of northern Maradi , Tahoua , Tillabéri , and Zinder of Niger from 2005 to 2006. It was caused by an early end to the 2004 rains, desert locust damage to some pasture lands, high food prices, and chronic poverty .
