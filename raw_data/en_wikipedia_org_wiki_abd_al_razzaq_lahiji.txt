Al-Hosayn Lāhījī Native name Arabic : فياض اللاهيجي Born Lahijan , Safavid Iran (present-day Iran ) Died c. 1662 CE (1072 AH ) Occupation Theologian, poet, philosopher Children 2+, including Hasan Relatives Mulla Sadra (father-in-law) ʿAbd-Al-Razzāq B. ʿAlī B. Al-Hosayn Lāhījī (died c. 1072 AH [1662 CE]) was an Iranian theologian, poet and philosopher.

[ 1 ] His mentor in philosophy was his father-in-law Mulla Sadra .

Life [ edit ] Hailing from Lahijan in Gilan , he spent most of his life in Qom . Abd al-Razzaq was a son-in-law of Mulla Sadra along with Molla Mohsen Fayz Kashani .

[ 2 ] His son Hasan would become another prominent theologian and philosopher of the Safavid dynasty.

[ 3 ] Seyyed Hossein Nasr knows him among the intellectual figures in Persia.

[ 4 ] Abd al-Razzaq was in agreement with Molla Sadra as to the contrast between primacy of quiddity and primacy of existence.

[ 5 ] Works [ edit ] Gawhar-e morād (Tehran, 1271 AH), a detailed exposition of his theology Sarmāya-ye īmān Dīvān , a volume of his poetry Tašrīqāt , three treatises on divine unity, justice and love Teaching and pupils [ edit ] According to Madlung, Abd-Razzaq taught at the Masumieh madrasah. There his prominent pupils included his sons Hasan and Ebrahim as well as Qazi Saeed Qommi.

[ 6 ] Philosophy [ edit ] Lāhīǰī stands at the end of a transition in Islamic scholastic theology in which the thought system of kalam was gradually replaced by that of falsafa , heavily influenced by the school of Avicenna .

[ 1 ] Lahiji in fact developed a form of Kalam which is hardly distinguishable from Hikmat, although at least in his better known works such as the "Gawhar-e morād" he does not follow the main doctrinal teachings of Mulla Sadra, as on the unity of Being and the catharsis of the faculty of imagination.
