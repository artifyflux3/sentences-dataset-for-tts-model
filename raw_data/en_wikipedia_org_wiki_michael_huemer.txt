[ 1 ] He has defended ethical intuitionism , direct realism , metaphysical libertarianism , phenomenal conservatism , substance dualism , reincarnation , the repugnant conclusion , [ 2 ] and philosophical anarchism .

Education and career [ edit ] Huemer graduated from the University of California, Berkeley , and earned his Ph.D. at Rutgers University in 1998 under the supervision of Peter D. Klein .

[ 3 ] Philosophical work [ edit ] Huemer is a philosophical dualist [ 4 ] and an agnostic .

[ 5 ] His 2005 book, Ethical Intuitionism , was reviewed in Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews , [ 6 ] Philosophy and Phenomenological Research , [ 7 ] and Mind .

[ 8 ] In 2013, he published The Problem of Political Authority , in which he argues that modern arguments for political authority fail and that society can function properly without state coercion.

[ 9 ] Phenomenal conservatism [ edit ] Huemer has defended phenomenal conservatism , the epistemological view that it is reasonable to assume that things are as they appear, except when there are positive grounds for doubting this.

[ 10 ] [ 11 ] Problem of evil [ edit ] Huemer has stated that the presence of evil in the world, such as children with terrible diseases, is strong evidence that an omnipotent , omniscient , and omnibenevolent God does not exist.

[ 5 ] Reincarnation [ edit ] Huemer defended reincarnation in his 2021 paper "Existence Is Evidence of Immortality".

[ 12 ] He has argued that immaterial souls exist, [ 5 ] and in 2022, he debated Graham Oppy on the topic.

[ 13 ] Animal ethics [ edit ] On the ethics of eating meat , Huemer has commented that "In the overwhelming majority of actual cases, meat eaters do not have any reasons that could plausibly be claimed to justify the pain and suffering caused by their practice." [ 14 ] In 2016, he debated Bryan Caplan on the ethical treatment of animals, including insects.

[ 15 ] Regarding killing insects, he has argued that they are not raised in horrible conditions like animals in factory farms and that animal farming requires killing more insects, claiming that it is "much less likely that insects feel pain".

[ 16 ] His 2019 book, Dialogues on Ethical Vegetarianism , is a series of dialogues on the ethics of eating meat .

Peter Singer , who wrote the foreword to the book, commented that "In the future, when people ask me why I don't eat meat, I will tell them to read this book." [ 17 ] [ 18 ] Ostroveganism [ edit ] Huemer is an advocate of ostroveganism, a plant-based diet with the addition of oysters and other bivalves .

[ 19 ] [ 20 ] In a 2023 interview, Huemer stated that it is "fair game" to eat animals without brains such as scallops and that he also occasionally eats pasture-raised eggs.

[ 21 ] He has argued that is impossible to inflict pain on bivalves, because they do not have a brain.

[ 22 ] Personal life [ edit ] Huemer is married to Iskra Fileva, [ 4 ] who teaches philosophy at the University of Colorado Boulder .
