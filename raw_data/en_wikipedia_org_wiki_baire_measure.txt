In compact metric spaces the Borel sets and the Baire sets are the same, so Baire measures are the same as Borel measures that are finite on compact sets . In general Baire sets and Borel sets need not be the same. In spaces with non-Baire Borel sets, Baire measures are used because they connect to the properties of continuous functions more directly.

Variations [ edit ] There are several inequivalent definitions of Baire sets , so correspondingly there are several inequivalent concepts of Baire measure on a topological space. These all coincide on spaces that are locally compact œÉ-compact Hausdorff spaces .

Relation to Borel measure [ edit ] In practice Baire measures can be replaced by regular Borel measures . The relation between Baire measures and regular Borel measures is as follows: The restriction of a finite Borel measure to the Baire sets is a Baire measure.

A finite Baire measure on a compact space is always regular.

A finite Baire measure on a compact space is the restriction of a unique regular Borel measure.

On compact (or œÉ-compact) metric spaces, Borel sets are the same as Baire sets and Borel measures are the same as Baire measures.

Examples [ edit ] Counting measure on the unit interval is a measure on the Baire sets that is not regular (or œÉ-finite).

The (left or right) Haar measure on a locally compact group is a Baire measure invariant under the left (right) action of the group on itself. In particular, if the group is an abelian group , the left and right Haar measures coincide and we say the Haar measure is translation invariant . See also Pontryagin duality .
