It is one of the treatises on governance produced by the Exclusion Crisis of the last years of the reign of Charles II of England .

[ 1 ] Modern scholarship regards the 1698 book as "fairly close" to Sidney's manuscript.

[ 2 ] According to Christopher Hill , it "handed on many of the political ideas of the English revolutionaries to eighteen-century Whigs, American and French republicans." [ 3 ] Views [ edit ] The Discourses was written in the period when John Locke was working on his Second Treatise on Government , and the books have common features.  They have been described together as "essentially radical and popular theories of resistance ." [ 4 ] Jonathan Scott, however, has proposed that Sidney was "far more inclined to commonwealth principles and far more predisposed to resistance" than Locke.

[ 5 ] Mihoko Suzuki mentions "the lasting importance of the English Revolution and radical Protestantism" for "Sidney's political thought and his commitment to republican principles." [ 6 ] He was included in the "Whig canon" of writers introduced by Caroline Robbins , with principles in line with those of radical dissidents from the 1689 Settlement of the English monarchy.

[ 7 ] Leopold von Ranke 's History of England (in the translation by the School of Modern History at Oxford) [ 8 ] stated that: The work, more discursive than systematic in its character, contains the results of many varied studies, as far as the existing learning made them in any way possible; it offers wide prospects and general points of view, but bears at the same time the character of the moment, and is founded on the disputes of the time.

[ 9 ] Ranke's summation in the English context is "His idea is first of all to restrain the monarchy within the narrowest limits." [ 9 ] Scott A. Nelson, editor of the 1993 edition of the Discourses , commented: The text displays a disorganized prose that must have been worthless as a tract of insurrection. But a careful reading displays a remarkably consistent view of government [...] [ 10 ] Contra Patriarcha [ edit ] The Discourses is explicitly a rebuttal of Patriarcha, or The Natural Power of Kings , a work published in 1680 by the political theorist Robert Filmer , who had died in 1659. It seeks support from authors criticised by Filmer, such as George Buchanan and Hugo Grotius .

[ 11 ] Ranke states that Sidney opposed Filmer "in every point".

[ 9 ] Sidney's real target in the work was absolutism .

[ 11 ] While he concedes that absolute monarchy is an institution with Biblical support, and equates it with Plato's political philosophy , he denies that hereditary monarchy has any such standing.

[ 12 ] On the spectrum of English representatives of classical republicanism of the time, Scott places Sidney with John Milton as "moral humanists".

[ 13 ] Nicholas von Maltzahn considers that Sidney's was "a voice closer to Milton's than any other in the Restoration, one sharing his republican vocabulary and priorities to a remarkable degree." [ 14 ] Scott writes: Sidney's reply to Filmer is an attack on the political system of inheritance, and its substitution with a politics of virtue [...] [ 15 ] Sidney took the view in the Discourses that the government of the Rump Parliament , in which he sat,"produced more examples of pure, complete, incorruptible, and invincible virtue than Rome or Greece could ever boast".

[ 16 ] He argues in the Discourses that "the variety of forms of government between mere democracy and absolute monarchy is almost infinite", that good government is always a blend (of monarchy, aristocracy and democracy), and that Filmer was narrow and short-sighted.

[ 17 ] Influence and Sidney's reputation [ edit ] Worden writes in The Cambridge History of Political Thought that the influence of the Discourses was "probably wider than that of any other republican work of the seventeenth century." [ 18 ] An extended review by Jacques Bernard appeared in three successive issues of Nouvelles de la république des lettres in 1700.

Discours sur le gouvernement , a French translation in three volumes of the Discourses , was published at The Hague in 1702.

[ 19 ] Sidney was praised in works of 1719 by Gottlieb Treuer ( de:Gottlieb Treuer ) and of 1720 by Thémiseul Saint-Hyacinthe ( fr:Thémiseul de Saint-Hyacinthe ).

[ 20 ] [ 21 ] Sidney was one of the republican writers cited by Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke in his works Remarks on the History of England (1730–31) and A Dissertation upon Parties (1733–34) discussing the ancient constitution of England .

[ 22 ] He was one of the republican influences on Alberto Radicati , an exile from Piedmont of the 1720s who came to London.

[ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] Pocock in The Machiavellian Moment calls Sidney in the Discourses "... a voice from the past, recalling the Good Old Cause of the fifties and even the Tacitism of an earlier generation still, condemn[ing] absolute monarchy for corrupting the subject and equat[ing] virtue with a framework of mixed government so austerely defined as to be virtually an aristocratic government.

[ 26 ] Trevor Colbourn writes that Sidney's political thought was a significant influence on Andrew Eliot , Jonathan Mayhew , Sam Adams and Josiah Quincy Jr.

[ 27 ] The Discourses was in the personal libraries of John Adams , Robert Carter I , Robert Carter III and Thomas Jefferson (listed in 1771).

[ 28 ] Adams in particular was "a lifelong Sidney enthusiast". But in the later 18th century, French republican radicals found that "his arguments were no longer relevant." [ 29 ] Notes [ edit ] ^ Ashcraft, Richard (13 July 2021).
