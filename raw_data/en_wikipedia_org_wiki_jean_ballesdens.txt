He is the first known collector of books with historic bindings.

[ 1 ] Biography [ edit ] A lawyer to the parlement de Paris and secretary to chancellor Séguier , he was elected to the Académie française in 1648 - though he had renounced a place when it was first offered him, in favour of Pierre Corneille . He collected books and formed a library that was the rival of his master's in terms of numbers, choice and the editions' beauty. Notable books from it were the nine volumes in Grolier bindings.
