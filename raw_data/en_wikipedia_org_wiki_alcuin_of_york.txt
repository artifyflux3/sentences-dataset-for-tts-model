**Alcuin of York** (;[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcuin_of_York#cite_note-1)[Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_language "Latin language"): _Flaccus Albinus Alcuinus_; c. 735 – 19 May 804), also called **Ealhwine**, **Alhwin**, or **Alchoin**, was an Anglo-Latin scholar, clergyman, poet, and teacher from [York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/York "York"), [Northumbria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northumbria "Northumbria"). He was born around 735 and became the student of [Archbishop Ecgbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecgbert_of_York "Ecgbert of York") at York. At the invitation of [Charlemagne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlemagne "Charlemagne"), he became a leading scholar and teacher at the [Carolingian court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolingian_dynasty "Carolingian dynasty"), where he remained a figure in the 780s and 790s. Before that, he was also a court chancellor in [Aachen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aachen "Aachen"). "The most learned man anywhere to be found", according to [Einhard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einhard "Einhard")'s _[Life of Charlemagne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vita\_Karoli\_Magni "Vita Karoli Magni")_[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcuin_of_York#cite_note-FOOTNOTEEinhard200354-2) (c. 817–833), he is considered among the most important intellectual architects of the [Carolingian Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolingian_Renaissance "Carolingian Renaissance"). Among his pupils were many of the dominant intellectuals of the Carolingian era.

Alcuin wrote many theological and dogmatic treatises, as well as a few grammatical works and a number of poems. In 796, he was made abbot of [Marmoutier Abbey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marmoutier_Abbey,_Tours "Marmoutier Abbey, Tours"), in [Tours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tours "Tours"), where he worked on perfecting the [Carolingian minuscule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolingian_minuscule "Carolingian minuscule") script. He remained there until his death.

Alcuin was born in [Northumbria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northumbria "Northumbria"), presumably sometime in the 730s. Virtually nothing is known of his parents, family background, or origin.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcuin_of_York#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBullough2004164-3) In common hagiographical fashion, the _Vita Alcuini_ asserts that Alcuin was of "noble English stock", and this statement has usually been accepted by scholars. Alcuin's own work only mentions such collateral kinsmen as [Wilgils of Ripon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilgils "Wilgils"), father of the missionary saint [Willibrord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willibrord "Willibrord"); and [Beornrad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beornrad_(archbishop_of_Sens) "Beornrad (archbishop of Sens)") (also spelled Beornred), abbot of [Echternach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echternach "Echternach") and bishop of [Sens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sens "Sens").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcuin_of_York#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBullough2004146%E2%80%93147,_165-4) Willibrord, Alcuin and Beornrad were all related by blood.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcuin_of_York#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMayr-Harting2016212-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcuin_of_York#cite_note-FOOTNOTEStenton2001219-6)

In his _Life_ of St Willibrord, Alcuin writes that Wilgils called a _[Pater familias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pater\_familias "Pater familias")_, had founded an oratory and church at the mouth of the [Humber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humber "Humber"), which had fallen into Alcuin's possession by inheritance. Because in early Anglo-Latin writing _paterfamilias_ ("head of a family, householder") usually referred to a _[ceorl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churl "Churl")_ ("[churl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churl "Churl")"), [Donald A. Bullough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_A._Bullough "Donald A. Bullough") suggests that Alcuin's family was of _cierlisc_ ("churlish") status: i.e., free but subordinate to a noble lord, and that Alcuin and other members of his family rose to prominence through beneficial connections with the aristocracy.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcuin_of_York#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBullough2004146%E2%80%93147,_165-4) If so, Alcuin's origins may lie in the southern part of what was formerly known as [Deira](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deira "Deira").[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcuin_of_York#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBullough2004165-7)

The young Alcuin came to the [cathedral church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/York_Minster "York Minster") of York during the golden age of Archbishop [Ecgbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecgbert_of_York "Ecgbert of York") and his brother, the Northumbrian King [Eadberht](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eadberht_of_Northumbria "Eadberht of Northumbria"). Ecgbert had been a disciple of the [Venerable Bede](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bede "Bede"), who urged him to raise York to an [archbishopric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archbishopric "Archbishopric"). King Eadberht and Archbishop Ecgbert oversaw the re-energising and reorganisation of the [English church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Church_of_England "History of the Church of England"), with an emphasis on reforming the clergy and on the tradition of learning that Bede had begun. Ecgbert was devoted to Alcuin, who thrived under his tutelage.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcuin_of_York#cite_note-8)

The York school was renowned as a centre of learning in the liberal arts, literature, and science, as well as in religious matters.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcuin_of_York#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHutchison2006-9) From here, Alcuin drew inspiration for the school he would lead at the [Frankish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franks "Franks") court. He revived the school with the [trivium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trivium_(education) "Trivium (education)") and [quadrivium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrivium "Quadrivium") disciplines,[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcuin_of_York#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBurns1907-10) writing a [codex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex "Codex") on the trivium, while his student [Hrabanus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabanus_Maurus "Rabanus Maurus") wrote one on the quadrivium.

Alcuin graduated to become a teacher during the 750s. His ascendancy to the headship of the York school, the ancestor of [St Peter's School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Peter%27s_School,_York "St Peter's School, York"), began after [Æthelbert of York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%86thelbert_of_York "Æthelbert of York") became [Archbishop of York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archbishop_of_York "Archbishop of York") in 767. Around the same time, Alcuin became a [deacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deacon "Deacon") in the church. He was never ordained a priest. Though no real evidence shows that he took monastic vows, he lived as if he had.

In 781, King [Ælfwald I of Northumbria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%86lfwald_I_of_Northumbria "Ælfwald I of Northumbria") sent Alcuin to Rome to petition the Pope for official confirmation of York's status as an archbishopric and to confirm the election of the new archbishop, [Eanbald I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eanbald_(died_796) "Eanbald (died 796)"). On his way home, he met [Charlemagne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlemagne "Charlemagne") (whom he had met once before), this time in the Italian city of [Parma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parma "Parma").[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcuin_of_York#cite_note-11)

Alcuin's intellectual curiosity allowed him to be reluctantly persuaded to join Charlemagne's court. He joined an illustrious group of scholars whom Charlemagne had gathered around him, the mainsprings of the [Carolingian Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolingian_Renaissance "Carolingian Renaissance"): [Peter of Pisa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_of_Pisa "Peter of Pisa"), [Paulinus II of Aquileia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Paulinus_II "Saint Paulinus II"), Rado, and Abbot [Saint Fulrad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulrad "Fulrad"). Alcuin would later write, "the Lord was calling me to the service of King Charles".

Alcuin became master of the [Palace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlemagne%27s_Palace_in_Aachen "Charlemagne's Palace in Aachen") School of Charlemagne in [Aachen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aachen "Aachen") (_Urbs Regale_) in 782.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcuin_of_York#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBurns1907-10) It had been founded by the king's ancestors as a place for the education of the royal children (mostly in manners and the ways of the court). However, Charlemagne wanted to include the [liberal arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_arts "Liberal arts"), and most importantly, the study of religion. From 782 to 790, Alcuin taught Charlemagne himself, his sons [Pepin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepin_the_Hunchback "Pepin the Hunchback") and [Louis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_the_Pious "Louis the Pious"), as well as young men sent to be educated at court, and the young clerics attached to the [palace chapel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palatine_Chapel_in_Aachen "Palatine Chapel in Aachen"). Bringing with him from York his assistants Pyttel, Sigewulf, and Joseph, Alcuin revolutionised the educational standards of the Palace School, introducing Charlemagne to the liberal arts and creating a personalised atmosphere of scholarship and learning, to the extent that the institution came to be known as the "school of Master Albinus".

In this role as adviser, he took issue with the emperor's policy of forcing pagans to be baptised on pain of death, arguing, "Faith is a free act of the will, not a forced act. We must appeal to the conscience, not compel it by violence. You can force people to be baptised, but you cannot force them to believe". His arguments seem to have prevailed – Charlemagne abolished the death penalty for paganism in 797.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcuin_of_York#cite_note-FOOTNOTENeedham200052-12)

Charlemagne gathered the best men of every land in his court and became far more than just the king at the centre. It seems that he made many of these men his closest friends and counsellors. They referred to him as "David", a reference to the Biblical king [David](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_(biblical_king) "David (biblical king)"). Alcuin soon found himself on intimate terms with Charlemagne and the other men at court, where pupils and masters were known by affectionate and jesting nicknames.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcuin_of_York#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWilmot-Buxton192293-13) Alcuin himself was known as 'Albinus' or 'Flaccus'. While at [Aachen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aachen "Aachen"), Alcuin bestowed pet names upon his pupils – derived mainly from [Virgil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil "Virgil")'s _[Eclogues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclogues "Eclogues")_.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcuin_of_York#cite_note-FOOTNOTEJaeger199938-14) According to the _Encyclopædia Britannica_, "He loved Charlemagne and enjoyed the king's esteem, but his letters reveal that his fear of him was as great as his love."[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcuin_of_York#cite_note-EB-15)

After the death of [Pope Adrian I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Adrian_I "Pope Adrian I"), Alcuin was commissioned by Charlemagne to compose an epitaph for Adrian. The epitaph was inscribed on black stone quarried at Aachen and carried to Rome where it was set over Adrian's tomb in the south transept of [St. Peter's Basilica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Peter%27s_Basilica "St. Peter's Basilica") just before Charlemagne's coronation in the basilica on Christmas Day 800.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcuin_of_York#cite_note-16)

### Return to Northumbria and back to Francia

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alcuin&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Return to Northumbria and back to Francia")]

In 790, Alcuin returned from the court of Charlemagne to England, to which he had remained attached. He dwelt there for some time, but Charlemagne then invited him back to help in the fight against the [Adoptionist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Adoptionism "Spanish Adoptionism") heresy, which was at that time making great progress in [Toledo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toledo,_Spain "Toledo, Spain"), the old capital of the [Visigoths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visigoths "Visigoths") and still a major city for the Christians under [Islamic rule in Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Andalus "Al-Andalus"). He is believed to have had contacts with [Beatus of Liébana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beatus_of_Li%C3%A9bana "Beatus of Liébana"), from the [Kingdom of Asturias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Asturias "Kingdom of Asturias"), who fought against Adoptionism. At the [Council of Frankfurt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Frankfurt "Council of Frankfurt") in 794, Alcuin upheld the orthodox doctrine against the views expressed by [Felix of Urgel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix,_Bishop_of_Urgel "Felix, Bishop of Urgel"), an [heresiarch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heresiarch "Heresiarch") according to the [Catholic Encyclopedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Encyclopedia "Catholic Encyclopedia").[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcuin_of_York#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBurns1907-10) Having failed during his stay in Northumbria to influence King [Æthelred I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%86thelred_I_of_Northumbria "Æthelred I of Northumbria") in the conduct of his reign, Alcuin never returned home.

He was back at Charlemagne's court by at least mid-792, writing a series of letters to Æthelred, to Hygbald, Bishop of [Lindisfarne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Durham "Bishop of Durham"), and to [Æthelhard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%86thelhard "Æthelhard"), [Archbishop of Canterbury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archbishop_of_Canterbury "Archbishop of Canterbury") in the succeeding months, dealing with the [Viking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viking "Viking") attack on Lindisfarne in July 793. These letters and Alcuin's poem on the subject, _"De clade Lindisfarnensis monasterii"_, provide the only significant contemporary account of these events. In his description of the Viking attack, he wrote: "Never before has such terror appeared in Britain. Behold the [church of St Cuthbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Cuthbert%27s_Society,_Durham "St Cuthbert's Society, Durham"), splattered with the blood of God's priests, robbed of its ornaments."[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcuin_of_York#cite_note-17)

In 796, Alcuin was in his 60s. He hoped to be free from court duties and upon the death of Abbot Itherius of Saint Martin at [Tours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tours "Tours"), Charlemagne put [Marmoutier Abbey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marmoutier_Abbey,_Tours "Marmoutier Abbey, Tours") into Alcuin's care, with the understanding that he should be available if the king ever needed his counsel. There, he encouraged the work of the monks on the beautiful [Carolingian minuscule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolingian_minuscule "Carolingian minuscule") script, ancestor of modern Roman typefaces using a mixture of upper- and lower-case letters.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcuin_of_York#cite_note-EB-15)[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcuin_of_York#cite_note-FOOTNOTEColish199967-18) Latin [paleography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleography "Paleography") in the 8th century leaves little room for a single origin of the script, and sources contradict his importance as no proof has been found of his direct involvement in the creation of the script.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcuin_of_York#cite_note-19) Carolingian minuscule was already in use before Alcuin arrived in [Francia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francia "Francia").[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcuin_of_York#cite_note-20) Most likely he was responsible for copying and preserving the script[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcuin_of_York#cite_note-21) while at the same time restoring the purity of the form.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcuin_of_York#cite_note-22)

Alcuin died on 19 May 804, some 10 years before the emperor, and was buried at St. Martin's Church under an epitaph that partly read:[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcuin_of_York#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDuckett1951305-23)

> Dust, worms, and ashes now ...
> 
>  Alcuin my name, wisdom I always loved,
> 
>  Pray, reader, for my soul.

The majority of details on Alcuin's life come from his letters and poems. Also, autobiographical sections are in Alcuin's poem on York and in the _Vita Alcuini_, a [hagiography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagiography "Hagiography") written for him at [Ferrières](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferri%C3%A8res_Abbey "Ferrières Abbey") in the 820s, possibly based in part on the memories of Sigwulf, one of Alcuin's pupils.

Scholarly and literary output
-----------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alcuin&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Scholarly and literary output")]

The collection of mathematical and logical word problems entitled _Propositiones ad acuendos juvenes_ ("Problems to Sharpen Youths")[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcuin_of_York#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAlcuinn.d.-24) is sometimes attributed to Alcuin.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcuin_of_York#cite_note-Peterson-2005-25)[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcuin_of_York#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAtkinson2005354%E2%80%93362-26) In a 799 letter to Charlemagne, the scholar claimed to have sent "certain figures of arithmetic for the joy of cleverness",[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcuin_of_York#cite_note-27) which some scholars have identified with the _Propositiones_.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcuin_of_York#cite_note-FOOTNOTEJullien1994482-483-28)[[b]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcuin_of_York#cite_note-29)

The text contains about 53 mathematical word problems (with solutions), in no particular pedagogical order. Among the most famous of these problems are: four that involve [river crossings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_crossing_problem "River crossing problem"), including the [problem of three anxious brothers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jealous_husbands_problem "Jealous husbands problem"), each of whom has an unmarried sister whom he cannot leave alone with either of the other men lest she be defiled[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcuin_of_York#cite_note-3-brothers-30) (Problem 17); the [problem of the wolf, goat, and cabbage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox,_goose_and_bag_of_beans_puzzle "Fox, goose and bag of beans puzzle") (Problem 18); and the problem of "the two adults and two children where the children weigh half as much as the adults" (Problem 19). [Alcuin's sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcuin%27s_sequence "Alcuin's sequence") is the solution to one of the problems of that book.

Alcuin's work as a theologian was more concerned with conservation than originality. His nine scriptural commentaries—on [Genesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Genesis "Book of Genesis"), the [Psalms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psalms "Psalms"), the [Song of Solomon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song_of_Solomon "Song of Solomon"), [Ecclesiastes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecclesiastes "Ecclesiastes"), Hebrew Names, the [Gospel of John](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_of_John "Gospel of John"), the Epistles [to Titus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistle_to_Titus "Epistle to Titus"), [Philemon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistle_to_Philemon "Epistle to Philemon"), and [the Hebrews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistle_to_the_Hebrews "Epistle to the Hebrews"), The Sayings of St. Paul, and [the Apocalypse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Revelation "Book of Revelation")—consist mostly of sentences taken from the [Church Fathers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_Fathers "Church Fathers"), the apparent motive being to collect into convenient form the observations on the more important scriptural passages of the best commentators who had preceded him. Alcuin also engaged in [textual criticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textual_criticism "Textual criticism") of the [Vulgate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulgate "Vulgate"), which had many variant readings in his time. Four Bibles are shown by the dedicatory poems affixed to them to have been prepared by him, or under his direction at Tours, probably during the years 799–801. Whatever the exact changes made by Alcuin in the Bible text may have been, the known disposition of the man—that he intended to recover [Jerome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome "Jerome")'s original text as much as possible—no less than the limits of the scholarship of his time, makes it certain that these changes were not of a far-reaching kind.

Of the three brief moral treatises Alcuin has left us, two, _De virtutibus et vitiis_, and _De animae ratione_, are largely abridgments of the writing of [Augustine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine "Augustine") on the same subjects, while the third, "On the Confession of Sins," is a concise exposition of the nature of confession, addressed to a congregation of monks. Closely allied to his moral writings in spirit and purpose are his sketches of the lives of saints [Martin of Tours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_of_Tours "Martin of Tours"), [Vedast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedast "Vedast"), [Richarius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richarius "Richarius"), and [Willibrord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willibrord "Willibrord"), the last being a biography of considerable length.

Alcuin opposed [Spanish Adoptionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Adoptionism "Spanish Adoptionism"), a Christological viewpoint advanced by bishops [Felix of Urgell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_(bishop_of_Urgell) "Felix (bishop of Urgell)") and [Elipandus of Toledo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elipandus_of_Toledo "Elipandus of Toledo").

Besides his fame as an educator and a theologian, Alcuin was also the principal agent of the [liturgical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_(liturgy) "Mass (liturgy)") reform accomplished under the authority of Charlemagne. Upon Charlemagne's accession the [Gallican Rite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallican_Rite "Gallican Rite") prevailed in France, but it was so modified by local customs and traditions as to constitute a serious obstacle to complete ecclesiastical unity. It was the purpose of the king to substitute the [Roman Rite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Rite "Roman Rite") in place of the Gallican, or at least to bring about such a revision of the latter as to make it substantially one with the Roman. The strong leaning of Alcuin towards Roman traditions, combined with his conservative character and the universal authority of his name, qualified him for the accomplishment of a change which the royal authority in itself was powerless to effect.

The first of Alcuin's liturgical works appears to have been a homilary, or collection of [sermons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sermon "Sermon") in Latin for use by priests. Another liturgical work of Alcuin consists of a collection of readings to be read on Sundays and holy days throughout the year, the _Comes ab Albino ex Caroli imp. praecepto emendatus_. As, previous to his time, the portions of Scripture to be read at Mass were often merely indicated [on the margins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginalia "Marginalia") of the Bibles used, the _Comes_ commended itself by its convenience, and as he followed Roman usage here also, the result was another advance in the way of conformity to the Roman liturgy. The work of Alcuin which had the greatest and most lasting influence in this direction, however, was the [missal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missal "Missal") which he compiled; prescribed as the official liturgical book of the Frankish church, Alcuin's missal soon came to be commonly used throughout Europe and was largely instrumental in bringing about uniformity in respect to the liturgy of the Mass in the whole [Latin Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_Church "Latin Church"). Other liturgical productions of Alcuin were a collection of [votive Masses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Votive_Mass "Votive Mass") drawn up for the monks of [Fulda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulda "Fulda"), a treatise called _De psalmorum usu_, a [breviary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breviary "Breviary") for laymen, and a brief explanation of the ceremonies of baptism.

Alcuin made the abbey school into a model of excellence and students flocked to it. He had many manuscripts copied using outstandingly beautiful [calligraphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calligraphy "Calligraphy"), the [Carolingian minuscule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolingian_minuscule "Carolingian minuscule") based on round and legible [uncial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncial "Uncial") letters. He wrote many letters to his English friends, to [Arno, bishop of Salzburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arno_of_Salzburg "Arno of Salzburg") and above all to Charlemagne. These letters (of which 311 are extant) are filled mainly with pious meditations, but they form an important source of information as to the literary and social conditions of the time and are the most reliable authority for the history of [humanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanism "Humanism") during the [Carolingian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolingian "Carolingian") age. Alcuin trained the numerous monks of the abbey in piety, and in the midst of these pursuits, he died.

Alcuin is the most prominent figure of the [Carolingian Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolingian_Renaissance "Carolingian Renaissance"), in which three main periods have been distinguished: in the first of these, up to the arrival of Alcuin at the court, the Italians occupy a central place; in the second, Alcuin and the English are dominant; in the third (from 804), the influence of [Theodulf of Orléans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodulf_of_Orl%C3%A9ans "Theodulf of Orléans") is preponderant.

Alcuin also developed manuals used in his educational work – a [grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammar "Grammar") and works on [rhetoric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetoric "Rhetoric") and [dialectics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectics "Dialectics"). These are written in the form of a [dialogue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialogue "Dialogue"), and in two of them the interlocutors are Charlemagne and Alcuin. He wrote several [theological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theological "Theological") treatises: a _De fide Trinitatis_, and commentaries on the Bible.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcuin_of_York#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPage190915-31) Alcuin is credited with inventing the first known [question mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark "Question mark"), though it did not resemble the modern symbol.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcuin_of_York#cite_note-FOOTNOTETruss200376-32)

Alcuin transmitted to the [Franks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franks "Franks") the knowledge of Latin culture, which had existed in [Anglo-Saxon England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Anglo-Saxon_England "History of Anglo-Saxon England"). A number of his works still exist. Besides some graceful epistles in the style of [Venantius Fortunatus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venantius_Fortunatus "Venantius Fortunatus"), he wrote some long poems, and notably he is the author of a history (in verse) of the church at York, _Versus de patribus, regibus et sanctis Eboracensis ecclesiae_. At the same time, he is noted for making one of the only explicit comments on [Old English poetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English_poetry "Old English poetry") surviving from the early [Middle Ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages "Middle Ages"), in a letter to one Speratus, the bishop of an unnamed English [see](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episcopal_see "Episcopal see") (possibly [Unwona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unwona "Unwona") of Leicester): _"verba Dei legantur in sacerdotali convivio: ibi decet lectorem audiri, non citharistam; sermones patrum, non carmina gentilium. Quid [Hinieldus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinieldus "Hinieldus") cum Christo?"_ ("Let God's words be read at the episcopal dinner-table. It is right that a reader should be heard, not a harpist, patristic discourse, not pagan song. What has [Ingeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingeld "Ingeld") to do with Christ?").[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcuin_of_York#cite_note-33)

#### Perceived homoeroticism

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alcuin&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Perceived homoeroticism")]

Some historians, including the queer historian [John Boswell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Boswell "John Boswell"), have identified what they consider to be a [homoerotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoerotic "Homoerotic") or homosexual [subtext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtext "Subtext") in Alcuin's writings.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcuin_of_York#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBoswell2015189-34)[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcuin_of_York#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBromell200216-35)[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcuin_of_York#cite_note-FOOTNOTECoon201118-36) Others, like [Allen Frantzen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Frantzen "Allen Frantzen"), have disputed this characterisation of his work; Frantzen identifies Alcuin's language with that of medieval Christian _amicitia_ or friendship.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcuin_of_York#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFrantzen1998198-37)[[c]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcuin_of_York#cite_note-38) Douglas Dales and [Rowan Williams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rowan_Williams "Rowan Williams") say "the use of language drawn [by Alcuin] from the _[Song of Songs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song\_of\_Songs "Song of Songs")_ transforms apparently erotic language into something within Christian friendship – 'an ordained affection'".[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcuin_of_York#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDalesWilliams2013228-39) According to David Clark, passages in some of Alcuin's writings can be seen to display homosocial desire, even possibly homoerotic imagery, though he argues that it is not possible to necessarily determine whether they were the result of an outward expression of erotic feelings on the part of Alcuin.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcuin_of_York#cite_note-FOOTNOTEClark200980-40)
