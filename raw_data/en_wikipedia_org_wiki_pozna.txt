Dz. U., 2008, vol. 219, No. 1401 [ 5 ] Poznań ( Polish: [ˈpɔznaj̃] or [ˈpɔznaɲ] ⓘ ) [ a ] is a city on the River Warta in west Poland , within the Greater Poland region.

[ 7 ] The city is an important cultural and business center and one of Poland's most populous regions with many regional customs such as Saint John's Fair ( Jarmark Świętojański ), traditional Saint Martin's croissants and a local dialect. Among its most important heritage sites are the Renaissance Old Town, Town Hall and Poznań Cathedral .

Poznań is the fifth-largest city in Poland . As of 2023, the city's population is 540,146, while the Poznań metropolitan area ( Metropolia Poznań ) comprising Poznań County and several other communities is inhabited by over 1.029 million people.

[ 2 ] It is one of four historical capitals of medieval Poland and the ancient capital of the Greater Poland region, currently the administrative capital of the province called Greater Poland Voivodeship .

Poznań is a center of trade, sports, education, technology and tourism. It is an important academic site, with about 130,000 students and Adam Mickiewicz University , the third largest Polish university. The city serves as the seat of the oldest Polish diocese , now being one of the most populous Catholic archdioceses in the country. The city also hosts the Poznań International Fair , the biggest industrial fair in Poland and one of the largest in Europe. The city's other renowned landmarks include the National Museum , Grand Theatre , Fara Church and the Imperial Castle .

Poznań is classified as a Gamma−global city by Globalization and World Cities Research Network .

[ 8 ] According to several rankings it is one of the most business-friendly cities in Poland.

[ 9 ] It also ranks highly in safety and healthcare quality .

[ 10 ] The city of Poznań has also, many times, won the prize awarded by " Superbrands " for a very high quality city brand. In 2012, the Poznań's Art and Business Centre " Stary Browar " won a competition organised by National Geographic Traveler and was given the first prize as one of the seven "New Polish Wonders". Companies headquartered in the city include energy provider Enea , e-commerce company Allegro and convenience store chain Żabka .

The official patron saints of Poznań are Saint Peter and Paul of Tarsus , the patrons of the cathedral.

Martin of Tours – the patron of the main street Święty Marcin – is also regarded as one of the patron saints of the city.

Names [ edit ] 14th-century seal showing Poznań's coat of arms.

See also: Names of Poznań in different languages The name Poznań probably comes from the personal name Poznan , which was in turn derived from the Polish participle poznan(y) – "one who is known/recognized", and would mean "Poznan's town". It is also possible that the name comes directly from the verb poznać , which means "to get to know" or "to recognize", so it may simply mean "known town".

The earliest surviving references to the city are found in the chronicles of Thietmar of Merseburg written between 1012 and 1018: episcopus Posnaniensis (" bishop of Poznań ", in an entry for 970) and ab urbe Posnani ("from the city of Poznań", for 1005). The city's name appears in documents in the Latin nominative case as Posnania in 1236 and Poznania in 1247. The phrase in Poznan appears in 1146 and 1244.

The city's full official name is Stołeczne Miasto Poznań (The Capital City of Poznań), in reference to its role as a centre of political power in the early Polish state under the Piast dynasty . Poznań is known as Posen in German , and was officially called Haupt- und Residenzstadt Posen (Capital and Residence City of Posen) between 20 August 1910 and 28 November 1918. The Latin names of the city are Posnania and Civitas Posnaniensis . Its Yiddish name is פּױזן , or Poyzn .

History [ edit ] Main articles: History of Poznań , Timeline of Poznań , and Historical population of Poznań Early Middle Ages [ edit ] For centuries before the Christianization of Poland (an event that essentially is credited as the creation of the very first Polish state, the Duchy of Poland ), Poznań was an important cultural and political centre of the Western Polans . It consisted of a fortified stronghold between the Warta and Cybina rivers on what is now Ostrów Tumski .

Mieszko I , the first historically recorded ruler of the West Polans and of the early Polish state which they dominated, built one of his main stable headquarters in Poznań.

Mieszko's baptism in AD 966, seen as a defining moment in the Christianization of the Polish state, may have taken place in Poznań.

[ 11 ] 11th to 16th centuries [ edit ] Monument of Mieszko I and Bolesław I the Brave in Golden Chapel at Archcathedral Basilica .

Following the baptism , construction began of Poznań's cathedral , the first in Poland. Poznań was probably the main seat of the first missionary bishop sent to Poland, Bishop Jordan . The Congress of Gniezno in 1000 led to the country's first permanent archbishopric being established in Gniezno (which is generally regarded as Poland's capital in that period), although Poznań continued to have independent bishops of its own. Poznań's cathedral was the place of burial of the early Piast monarchs, among them Mieszko I, Bolesław I the Brave , Mieszko II Lambert , Casimir I , and later of Przemysł I and Przemysł II .

[ 12 ] The pagan reaction that followed Mieszko II's death (probably in Poznań) in 1034 left the region weak, and in 1038, Duke Bretislaus I of Bohemia sacked and destroyed both Poznań and Gniezno. Poland was reunited under Casimir I the Restorer in 1039, but the capital was moved to Kraków , which had been relatively unaffected by the troubles. In 1138, by the testament of Boleslaus III , Poland was divided into separate duchies under the late king's sons, and Poznań and its surroundings became the domain of Mieszko III the Old , the first of the Dukes of Greater Poland . This period of fragmentation lasted until 1320. Duchies frequently changed hands; control of Poznań, Gniezno and Kalisz sometimes lay with a single duke, but at other times these constituted separate duchies.

In about 1249, Duke Przemysł I began constructing what would become the Royal Castle on a hill on the left bank of the Warta . Then in 1253, Przemysł issued a charter to Thomas of Gubin for the founding of a town under Magdeburg law , between the castle and the river. Thomas brought a large number of German settlers to aid in the building and settlement of the city – this is an example of the German eastern migration ( Ostsiedlung ) characteristic of that period.

[ 13 ] [ 14 ] The city, which covered the area of today's Old Town neighbourhood, was surrounded by a defensive wall, integrated with the castle.

[ 15 ] The royal chancery and the university ensured a first flourishing of Polish literary culture in the city.

In reunited Poland, and later in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth , Poznań was the seat of a voivodeship . The city's importance began to grow in the Jagiellonian period, due to its position on trading routes from Lithuania and Ruthenia to western Europe. It would become a major center for the fur trade by the late 16th century. Suburban settlements developed around the city walls, on the river islands, and on the right bank, with some (Ostrów Tumski, Śródka , Chwaliszewo, Ostrówek) obtaining their own town charters. However, the city's development was hampered by regular major fires and floods. On 2 May 1536 a fire destroyed 175 buildings, including the castle, the town hall, the monastery, and the suburban settlement called St. Martin.

[ 16 ] In 1519, the Lubrański Academy had been established in Poznań as an institution of higher education, but without the right to award degrees, which was reserved to Kraków's Jagiellonian University . However, the Jesuits' college , founded in the city in 1571 during the Counter-Reformation , had the right to award degrees from 1611 until 1773, when it was combined with the academy.

17th and 18th centuries [ edit ] Interior details in Collegiate Basilica known as Fara built in 1651–1705; one of the finest examples of baroque architecture in Poland .

In the second half of the 17th century and most of the 18th, Poznań was severely affected by a series of wars, attendant military occupations, lootings and destruction – the Second and Third Northern Wars, the War of the Polish Succession , the Seven Years' War and the Bar Confederation . During the Deluge , Poznań's Jewish community was accused of collaborating with the invading Swedish enemy , and as a result suffered pogroms carried out by both the city's non-Jewish residents and units of the Polish Crown Army .

[ 17 ] It was also hit by frequent outbreaks of plague , and by floods, particularly that of 1736, which destroyed most of the suburban buildings. The population of the conurbation declined from 20,000 around 1600 to 6,000 around 1730, and Bambergian and Dutch settlers ( Bambers and Olęders ) were brought in to rebuild the devastated suburbs. In 1778, a "Committee of Good Order" ( Komisja Dobrego Porządku ) was established in the city, which oversaw rebuilding efforts and reorganized the city's administration. However, in 1793, in the Second Partition of Poland , Poznań came under the control of the Kingdom of Prussia , becoming part of (and initially the seat of) the province of South Prussia .

19th century to World War I [ edit ] The Prussian authorities expanded the city boundaries, making the walled city and its closest suburbs into a single administrative unit. Left-bank suburbs were incorporated in 1797, and Ostrów Tumski, Chwaliszewo, Śródka, Ostrówek and Łacina (St. Roch) in 1800. The old city walls were taken down in the early 19th century, and major development took place to the west of the old city, with many of the main streets of today's city center being laid out.

As Poznań grew in the 19th century, Berlin Gate ( c.

1890, b. 1849), main west gate of the Prussian inner fortification ring , almost immediately began to impede city's development and was torn down in 1901.

Polish Theatre (1875) had become a national stage in the Greater Poland region , then partly under Prussian / German rule.

In the Greater Poland uprising of 1806 , Polish soldiers and civilian volunteers assisted the efforts of Napoleon by driving out Prussian forces from the region. The city became a part of the Duchy of Warsaw in 1807, and was the seat of Poznań Department – a unit of administrative division and local government. However, in 1815, following the Congress of Vienna , the region was returned to Prussia, and Poznań became the capital of the semi-autonomous Grand Duchy of Posen . Around 1820, Poznań had over 20,000 inhabitants, 70% of whom were Poles, 20% Jews, and 10% Germans.

The city continued to expand, and various projects were funded by Polish philanthropists, such as the Raczyński Library and the Bazar hotel. The city's first railway, running north-west to Stargard , opened in 1848. Due to its strategic location, the Prussian authorities intended to make Poznań into a fortress city, building a ring of defensive fortifications around it. Work began on the citadel with Fort Winiary in 1828, and in subsequent years the entire set of defenses called Festung Posen was completed.

A Greater Poland Uprising during the Revolutions of 1848 was ultimately unsuccessful, and the Grand Duchy lost its remaining autonomy, Poznań becoming simply the capital of the Prussian Province of Posen . It would become part of the German Empire with the unification of German states in 1871. Polish patriots continued to form societies such as the Central Economic Society for the Grand Duchy of Poznań , and Polish Theatre opened in 1875. It became a national stage for the inhabitants of the province of Posen, and even in whole Greater Poland region , acting as a mainstay of Polish tradition and culture, and as a sign of resistance against the restrictive policies of the Prussian partition authorities. However, the authorities made efforts to Germanize the region, particularly through the Prussian Settlement Commission founded in 1886. Germans accounted for 38% of the city's population in 1867, though this percentage would later decline somewhat, particularly after the region returned to Poland.

Poznań in the 19th century Another expansion of Festung Posen was planned, with an outer ring of more widely spaced forts around the perimeter of the city. Building of the first nine forts began in 1876, and nine intermediate forts were built from 1887. The inner ring of fortifications was now considered obsolete and came to be mostly taken down by the early 20th century, although the citadel remained in use. This made space for further civilian construction, particularly the Prussian Royal Residence Palace ( Zamek ) which was completed in 1910, and other grand buildings around it, including today's central university buildings and the opera house. The city's boundaries were also significantly extended to take in former suburban villages: Piotrowo and Berdychowo in 1896, Łazarz, Górczyn, Jeżyce and Wilda in 1900, and Sołacz in 1907.

In 1910, Poznań had 156,696 inhabitants, of which nearly 60% were Poles (over 91,000 Polish inhabitants of the city), and around 40% were Germans (over 65,000 German inhabitants of the city). Other nationalities accounted for 1-2% of the population (mainly Jews).  Germans tended to settle in the newer western part of the city, the Kaiserviertel or Kaiser district, Poles in the older east side.  And while there was tension between the two major populations there was also some overlap between them, particularly in cultural events.

[ 18 ] The percentage of Polish-speakers declined from 76.6% in 1846 to 69.9% in 1858 and just 50.4% in 1890, but then rebounded to 57.9% in 1910. According to censuses of elementary school pupils the share of Polish-speakers among pupils was higher: 63.7% in 1886 and 78.7% in 1911.

[ 19 ] After independence the percentage of Polish-speakers was 92.8% in 1921 [ 20 ] and 96.6% in 1931.

[ 21 ] Interbellum [ edit ] Successful Greater Poland uprising broke out on 27 December 1918 after a patriotic speech by Ignacy Paderewski at Hotel Bazar , pictured in that period.

At the end of World War I , the Treaty of Versailles awarded the province and city of Posen to the new Poland. The local German populace were forced to acquire Polish citizenship or leave the country, forfeiting all property to the Polish State. This led to a wide emigration of the ethnic Germans of the town's population – the town's German population decreased from 65,321 in 1910 to 5,980 by 1926 and further to 4,387 in 1934.

[ 22 ] In the interwar Second Polish Republic , the city again became the capital of Poznań Voivodeship . Poznań's university, today called Adam Mickiewicz University , was founded in 1919, and in 1924 the Poznań International Fair began. In 1929, the fair site was the venue for a major National Exhibition ( Powszechna Wystawa Krajowa , popularly PeWuKa ) marking the tenth anniversary of independence; organized on a space of 650,000 square metres it attracted around 4.5 million visitors. In the 1930s, the fair ranked as European fourth largest organiser of international trade events.

[ 23 ] Staging of the Exhibition  coincided with the advent of the economic  crisis. Preparations for the Exhibition required an enormous amount of work, and considerable investments were needed to build a suitable infrastructure. Poznań became a large building site, with many labourers coming to the city in search of employment. After 1929 those labourers added to the large group of the unemployed in the aftermath of the great economic crisis.

[ 24 ] The city's boundaries were again expanded in 1925 to include Główna, Komandoria , Rataje , Starołęka, Dębiec , Szeląg and Winogrady , and in 1933: Golęcin and Podolany .

World War II [ edit ] During the German occupation of 1939–1945, Poznań was incorporated into the Nazi Germany as the capital of Reichsgau Wartheland . Many Polish inhabitants, even children as young as 10, were executed, arrested, expelled to the General Government or used as forced labour .

[ 25 ] Polish children were also kidnapped and deported to an infamous camp for Polish children in Łódź .

[ 26 ] At the same time, many Germans and Volksdeutsche were settled in the city. The German population increased from around 5,000 in 1939 (some 2% of the inhabitants) to around 95,000 in 1944.

[ 27 ] [ 28 ] The Jewish community's history in the city dates back to the 13th century.

[ 29 ] In the past, the Jewish council in Poznan became one of the oldest and most important Jewish councils in Poland.

[ 30 ] The pre-war Jewish population of at least about 2,000 [ 31 ] were mostly murdered in the Holocaust [ citation needed ] .

A concentration camp was set up in Fort VII , one of the 19th-century perimeter forts. The camp was later moved to Żabikowo south of Poznań. Also the Stalag XXI-D German prisoner-of-war camp for Allied POWs of various nationalities was based in the city.

The Polish resistance was active in Poznań with various organizations and activities, and even an underground Polish parliament was established in the city.

[ 32 ] The German authorities significantly expanded Poznań's boundaries to include most of the present-day area of the city; these boundaries were retained after the war. Poznań was captured by the Red Army , assisted by Polish volunteers [ citation needed ] , on 23 February 1945 following the Battle of Poznań , in which the German army conducted a last-ditch defence in line with Hitler's designation of the city as a Festung . The Citadel was the last point to be taken, and the fighting left much of the city, particularly the Old Town, seriously damaged. Many monuments were also destroyed, including Gutzon Borglum 's statue of Woodrow Wilson in Poznan.

[ 33 ] 1945–present [ edit ] Due to the expulsion and flight of German population , Poznań's post-war population became almost uniformly Polish. The city again became a voivodeship capital. In 1950, the size of Poznań Voivodeship was reduced, and the city itself was given separate voivodeship status. This status was lost in the 1975 reforms, which also significantly reduced the size of Poznań Voivodeship.

From left: Poznań protests of 1956 – the first of several massive protests against the communist government – the sign reads "We demand bread!"; Poznań Crosses – Monument to the Victims of June 1956 (built and pictured in 1981).

The Poznań 1956 protests are seen as an early instance of discontent with communist rule. In June 1956, a protest by workers at the city's Cegielski locomotive factory developed into a series of strikes and popular protests against the policies of the government. After a protest march on 28 June was fired on, crowds attacked the communist party and secret police headquarters, where they were repulsed by gunfire. Riots continued for two days until being quelled by the army; 67 people were killed according to official figures. A monument to the victims was erected in 1981 at Plac Mickiewicza.

[ 34 ] The post-war years had seen much reconstruction work on buildings damaged in the fighting. From the 1960s onwards intensive housing development took place, consisting mainly of pre-fabricated concrete blocks of flats , especially in Rataje and Winogrady , and later Piątkowo , following its incorporation into the city in 1974. Another infrastructural change, which was completed in 1968, was the rerouting of the river Warta to follow two straight branches either side of Ostrów Tumski.

The most recent expansion of the city's boundaries took place in 1987, with the addition of new areas mainly to the north, including Morasko , Radojewo and Kiekrz . The first free local elections following the fall of communism took place in 1990. With the Polish local government reforms of 1999, Poznań again became the capital of a larger province entitled Greater Poland Voivodeship . It also became the seat of a powiat Poznań County , with the city itself gaining separate powiat status.

Post-communism infrastructural developments include the opening of the Pestka Fast Tram route in 1997, and Poznań's first motorway connections in 2003 as Poland's east–west A2 highway runs south of the city centre, serving also as a bypass. In 2006 country's first F-16 Fighting Falcons came to be stationed at the 31st Air Base in Krzesiny in the south-east of the city.

Poznań continues to host regular trade fairs and international events, including the United Nations Climate Change Conference in 2008. It was one of the host cities for UEFA Euro 2012 .

Geography [ edit ] Location and topography [ edit ] Further information: Geography of Poland Panoramic view of Old Town in winter.

Poznań covers an area of 261.91 km 2 (101.1 sq mi), and has coordinates in the range 52°17'34''–52°30'27''N, 16°44'08''–17°04'28''E. Its highest point, with an altitude of 157 m (515 ft), is the summit of Morasko hill within the Morasko meteorite nature reserve in the north of the city. The lowest altitude is 60 m (197 ft), in the Warta valley.

Poznań's main river is the Warta , which flows through the city from south to north. As it approaches the city centre it divides into two branches, flowing west and east of Ostrów Tumski Cathedral island, and meeting again further north. The smaller Cybina river flows through eastern Poznań to meet the east branch of the Warta, which is also called Cybina – its northern section was originally a continuation of that river, while its southern section has been artificially widened to form a main stream of the Warta. Other tributaries of the Warta within Poznań are the Junikowo Stream (Strumień Junikowski) , which flows through southern Poznań from the west, meeting the Warta just outside the city boundary in Luboń ; the Bogdanka and Wierzbak, formerly two separate tributaries flowing from the north-west and along the north side of the city centre, now with their lower sections diverted underground; the Główna, flowing through the neighbourhood of the same name in north-east Poznań; and the Rose Stream (Strumień Różany) flowing east from Morasko in the north of the city. The course of the Warta in central Poznań was formerly quite different from today: the main stream ran between Grobla and Chwaliszewo, which were originally both islands. The branch west of Grobla (the Zgniła Warta – "rotten Warta") was filled in late in the 19th century, and the former main stream west of Chwaliszewo was diverted and filled in during the 1960s. This was done partly to prevent floods, which did serious damage to Poznań frequently throughout history.

Warta River Valley in Poznań The largest of city's four major lakes, Great Kierskie Lake , is a centre of sailing and iceboating.

Poznań's largest lake is Kiekrz in the north-west end of the city. Other large lakes include Malta , an artificial lake formed in 1952 on the lower Cybina river, Strzeszyn on the Bogdanka, and Rusałka , an artificial lake formed in 1943 further down the Bogdanka river. The latter two are popular bathing places. Kiekrz lake is much used for sailing , while Malta is a competitive rowing and canoeing venue.

The city centre – including the Old Town , the former islands of Grobla and Chwaliszewo, the main street Święty Marcin and many other important buildings and districts – lies on the west side of the Warta. Opposite it between the two branches of the Warta is Ostrów Tumski, containing Cathedral and other ecclesiastical buildings, as well as housing and industrial facilities. Facing the cathedral on the east bank of the river is the historic district of Śródka . Large areas of apartment blocks, built from the 1960s onwards, include Rataje in the east, and Winogrady and Piątkowo north of the centre. Older residential and commercial districts include those of Wilda, Łazarz and Górczyn to the south, and Jeżyce to the west. There are also significant areas of forest within the city boundaries, particularly in the east adjoining Swarzędz , and around the lakes in the north-west.

Snow is common in winter, when night-time temperatures are typically below zero. In summer temperatures may often reach 30 °C (86 °F). Annual rainfall is more than 500 mm (20 in), among the lowest in Poland. The rainiest month is July, mainly due to short but intense cloudbursts and thunderstorms. The number of hours of sunshine are among the highest in the country. The warmest temperature was recorded on 11 July 1959 at 38.7 °C (101.7 °F) Climate data for Poznań ( Poznań Airport ), elevation: 83 m or 272 ft, 1991–2020 normals, extremes 1951–present Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year Record high °C (°F) 15.8 (60.4) 18.1 (64.6) 24.0 (75.2) 30.5 (86.9) 31.8 (89.2) 38.0 (100.4) 38.2 (100.8) 37.1 (98.8) 34.6 (94.3) 27.9 (82.2) 19.9 (67.8) 15.6 (60.1) 38.2 (100.8) Mean maximum °C (°F) 9.3 (48.7) 11.1 (52.0) 17.3 (63.1) 24.2 (75.6) 27.7 (81.9) 31.5 (88.7) 32.6 (90.7) 32.3 (90.1) 26.9 (80.4) 21.3 (70.3) 14.0 (57.2) 10.1 (50.2) 34.3 (93.7) Mean daily maximum °C (°F) 2.1 (35.8) 3.7 (38.7) 8.1 (46.6) 15.0 (59.0) 19.8 (67.6) 23.1 (73.6) 25.2 (77.4) 24.9 (76.8) 19.5 (67.1) 13.3 (55.9) 7.1 (44.8) 3.2 (37.8) 13.8 (56.8) Daily mean °C (°F) −0.4 (31.3) 0.5 (32.9) 3.8 (38.8) 9.5 (49.1) 14.1 (57.4) 17.5 (63.5) 19.5 (67.1) 19.1 (66.4) 14.3 (57.7) 9.1 (48.4) 4.4 (39.9) 0.9 (33.6) 9.4 (48.9) Mean daily minimum °C (°F) −2.9 (26.8) −2.4 (27.7) 0.0 (32.0) 4.0 (39.2) 8.4 (47.1) 11.9 (53.4) 14.1 (57.4) 13.7 (56.7) 9.6 (49.3) 5.4 (41.7) 1.8 (35.2) −1.4 (29.5) 5.2 (41.4) Mean minimum °C (°F) −13.5 (7.7) −11.6 (11.1) −7.8 (18.0) −3.4 (25.9) 0.9 (33.6) 5.8 (42.4) 8.6 (47.5) 7.2 (45.0) 2.6 (36.7) −2.8 (27.0) −5.6 (21.9) −10.1 (13.8) −16.1 (3.0) Record low °C (°F) −28.5 (−19.3) −28.0 (−18.4) −21.4 (−6.5) −8.6 (16.5) −3.9 (25.0) 0.5 (32.9) 3.8 (38.8) 3.2 (37.8) −1.7 (28.9) −8.3 (17.1) −15.2 (4.6) −24.9 (−12.8) −28.5 (−19.3) Average precipitation mm (inches) 37.7 (1.48) 30.7 (1.21) 39.9 (1.57) 38.6 (1.52) 53.8 (2.12) 57.5 (2.26) 84.4 (3.32) 55.9 (2.20) 41.2 (1.62) 35.4 (1.39) 33.6 (1.32) 40.1 (1.58) 538.9 (21.22) Average extreme snow depth cm (inches) 3.9 (1.5) 4.2 (1.7) 2.5 (1.0) 0.6 (0.2) 0.0 (0.0) 0.0 (0.0) 0.0 (0.0) 0.0 (0.0) 0.0 (0.0) 0.1 (0.0) 1.3 (0.5) 3.2 (1.3) 4.2 (1.7) Average precipitation days (≥ 0.1 mm) 16.47 13.10 13.40 10.20 12.17 12.43 13.60 12.23 10.67 12.93 13.37 16.50 157.06 Average snowy days (≥ 0 cm) 12.7 10.0 4.0 0.4 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.1 1.7 6.8 35.7 Average relative humidity (%) 86.9 83.2 76.5 66.8 67.4 68.0 68.6 69.6 76.6 82.7 88.3 88.5 76.9 Mean monthly sunshine hours 50.8 71.8 123.1 211.1 255.4 257.3 268.5 252.7 165.2 112.7 53.9 36.6 1,859 Source 1: Institute of Meteorology and Water Management [ 35 ] [ 36 ] [ 37 ] [ 38 ] [ 39 ] [ 40 ] [ 41 ] [ 42 ] Source 2: Meteomodel.pl (records, relative humidity 1991–2020) [ 43 ] [ 44 ] [ 45 ] Climate data for Poznań ( Poznań Airport ), elevation: 83 m or 272 ft, 1961–1990 normals and extremes Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year Record high °C (°F) 13.2 (55.8) 17.6 (63.7) 24.0 (75.2) 29.9 (85.8) 31.5 (88.7) 33.7 (92.7) 36.4 (97.5) 36.1 (97.0) 34.6 (94.3) 27.9 (82.2) 19.9 (67.8) 15.0 (59.0) 36.4 (97.5) Mean daily maximum °C (°F) 0.5 (32.9) 2.2 (36.0) 6.8 (44.2) 13.0 (55.4) 18.8 (65.8) 22.1 (71.8) 23.5 (74.3) 23.1 (73.6) 18.7 (65.7) 13.1 (55.6) 6.4 (43.5) 2.2 (36.0) 12.5 (54.6) Daily mean °C (°F) −2.0 (28.4) −1.0 (30.2) 2.7 (36.9) 7.6 (45.7) 13.3 (55.9) 16.7 (62.1) 18.0 (64.4) 17.4 (63.3) 13.4 (56.1) 8.8 (47.8) 3.8 (38.8) −0.1 (31.8) 8.2 (46.8) Mean daily minimum °C (°F) −4.8 (23.4) −3.9 (25.0) −0.8 (30.6) 2.8 (37.0) 7.7 (45.9) 11.2 (52.2) 12.5 (54.5) 12.2 (54.0) 9.0 (48.2) 5.3 (41.5) 1.2 (34.2) −2.6 (27.3) 4.1 (39.5) Record low °C (°F) −28.5 (−19.3) −26.7 (−16.1) −21.4 (−6.5) −8.6 (16.5) −3.0 (26.6) 0.5 (32.9) 4.7 (40.5) 3.2 (37.8) −1.7 (28.9) −8.3 (17.1) −15.2 (4.6) −24.9 (−12.8) −28.5 (−19.3) Average precipitation mm (inches) 30 (1.2) 24 (0.9) 27 (1.1) 36 (1.4) 53 (2.1) 60 (2.4) 69 (2.7) 57 (2.2) 43 (1.7) 39 (1.5) 39 (1.5) 38 (1.5) 515 (20.2) Average precipitation days (≥ 1.0 mm) 8.1 6.7 6.9 7.3 8.4 8.7 9.2 9.0 7.2 7.1 8.8 9.5 96.9 Mean monthly sunshine hours 40.0 61.0 109.0 152.0 219.0 215.0 218.0 206.0 138.0 102.0 40.0 32.0 1,532 Source: NOAA [ 46 ] Administration [ edit ] Government and politics [ edit ] The seat of the City Hall of Poznań is located in the former Jesuit College .

The city of Poznań, serving as the administrative center of the Greater Poland Voivodeship , houses both the Voivode of Greater Poland and the Marshal of Greater Poland. Poznań, which holds the status of both a municipality and a county city, is home not only to the local authorities of Poznań but also to the authorities of the Poznań County . Additionally, the city hosts the[Union of Polish Cities and the Association of Municipalities and Counties of Greater Poland .

[ 47 ] The Poznań City Council is the legislative and supervisory body, elected for a four-year term. The current council members were elected in 2023. The council consists of 37 members. The Chairman of the Poznań City Council is Grzegorz Ganowicz (KO), and the Vice-Chairpersons are Przemysław Alexandrowicz (PiS), Agnieszka Lewandowska (KO), and Halina Owsianna. The council members collaborate within 14 permanent committees.

[ 47 ] The Marshal's Office of the Greater Poland Voivodeship The office of the President of Poznań is held by Jacek Jaśkowiak , with the Deputy Presidents being Mariusz Wiśniewski, Jędrzej Solarski, and Natalia Weremczuk. The position of City Treasurer is occupied by Barbara Sajnaj, while Stanisław Tamm serves as the City Secretary.

[ 47 ] Administrative services for citizens are managed by 30 departments and equivalent organizational units of the City of Poznań Office. Additionally, the city operates 328 municipal organizational units to fulfill various public tasks. Throughout the year, the departments of the City of Poznań Office and municipal administrative units issue approximately 565,000 administrative decisions.

[ 47 ] Administrative division [ edit ] Main article: Administrative division of Poznań Administrative division into 42 osiedla auxiliary units since 2011.

The pre-1990 division into main districts dzielnica , still retained for some administrative purposes and used by locals.

Poznań is divided into 42 neighbourhoods called osiedle , each of which has its own elected council with certain decision-making and spending powers. The first uniform elections for these councils covering the whole area of the city were held on 20 March 2011.

[ citation needed ] For certain administrative purposes, the old division into five districts called dzielnica is used – although they ceased to be governmental units in 1990. These are: Stare Miasto (Old Town), population 161,200, area 47.1 km 2 (18.2 sq mi), covering the central and northern parts of the city Nowe Miasto (New Town), population 141,424, area 105.1 km 2 (40.6 sq mi), including all parts of the city on the east bank of the Warta Grunwald , population 125,500, area 36.2 km 2 (14.0 sq mi), covering the south-western parts of the city Jeżyce , population 81,300, area 57.9 km 2 (22.4 sq mi), covering the north-western parts of the city Wilda , population 62,290, area 15.0 km 2 (5.8 sq mi), in the southern part of the city Many citizens of Poznań thanks to the strong economy of the city and high salaries started moving to suburbs of the Poznań County ( powiat ) in the 1990s.

[ citation needed ] Architecture [ edit ] Gothic [ edit ] Cathedral vault Polychromes in St. Adalbert's Church .

The relocation of Poznań from the right to the left bank of the Warta River occurred in the mid-13th century, during the height of the Gothic architecture . This significant urban shift led to the preservation of numerous Gothic structures, both religious and secular, on both sides of the Warta River, within the area of the former chartered town. The Gothic style in Poznań flourished from approximately the mid-13th century to the end of the 15th century.

The Archcathedral Basilica of St. Peter and St. Paul on Ostrów Tumski is considered the most important Gothic sacred building in Poznań. Its current form emerged following a 14th-15th century reconstruction that replaced an earlier pre-Romanesque and Romanesque church. The Gothic design of the three-aisled basilica , with a presbytery surrounded by an ambulatory and a ring of chapels, was consolidated through post-World War II restorations aimed at recovering the cathedral’s medieval character. The spatial layout exhibits all the hallmarks of mature Gothic architecture. The interior is unified by a system of cross-rib vaults in the main nave and lierne vaults in the presbytery, supported by slender pillars. The vertical division includes pointed inter-nave arcades and a triforium gallery. The western façade is flanked by two massive towers with pointed pinnacles , between which rises a stepped gable adorned with ceramic decoration and a large rose window . The dominant building material is red, hand-formed brick, typical of North European Gothic. However, the Poznań cathedral embodies not only the broader tradition of Brick Gothic but also features specific elements of Polish Gothic , visible in both spatial organization and architectural detailing. Particularly characteristic of the local tradition are thick structural walls and the decorative use of clinker brick ( zendrówka – dark, overfired brick often used for visual contrast in elevations). Another feature of Polish Gothic is the presence of numerous side chapels, designed as individual recesses set between buttresses – a solution typical of cathedrals founded by the Piast dynasty .

[ 48 ] Notable Gothic sites in the older, right-bank part of the city include: [ 49 ] Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary (in summo) – erected on the site of a former princely palatium, this church originally housed a chapel founded around 965. The present structure was developed in several phases, with the nave constructed in the first half of the 15th century.

Church of Saint John of Jerusalem outside the walls – built by the Knights Hospitaller at the turn of the 12th and 13th centuries, it is among the earliest brick churches in Poland.

Church of St. Margaret – dating from the late 12th century, this church served the religious needs of Śródka, then the most populous area of the Poznań settlement complex. The Baroque interior, largely created in the 17th century, harmonizes with the Gothic architecture.

Cathedral and Church of Holy Virgin Mary on the left.

In the left-bank part of the city, the most prominent Gothic monuments include: [ 49 ] Church of St. Adalbert – a three-nave pseudo-basilica, built on a rectangular trapezoidal plan, located on St. Adalbert's Hill.

Church of Our Lady Help of Christians and Salesian Monastery – inside, above the presbytery, a unique type of Gothic rib vaulting, known as the Piast vault, can be found, while the northern nave features a star vault.

Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and Our Lady of Consolation – the oldest surviving church on the left bank of Warta.

Church of St. Martin – likely constructed by Duke Przemysł I in 1240.

Church of Corpus Christi and former Carmelite Monastery – the largest Gothic church in Poznań after the cathedral, this site was a major pilgrimage destination in the Middle Ages. The current form of the church and monastery resulted from reconstruction work between 1465 and 1470.

Renaissance [ edit ] The introduction of the Renaissance to Poznań resulted in the construction of many grand buildings. Noteworthy among these is the Town Hall, an exemplary piece of Renaissance architecture in Poland. The Town Hall underwent a significant reconstruction in the mid-16th century, after a fire in 1536. The city authorities entrusted the reconstruction to Giovanni Battista Quadro from Lugano in 1550. He expanded the building westward by approximately 11 meters and added an additional floor. The reconstruction was completed in 1560. The Renaissance Town Hall is characterized by its rectangular plan, three-story loggia on the facade, and three polygonal turrets . The central turret houses a clock mechanism featuring goats, a popular attraction in Poznań since 1551. The attic frieze depicts Jagiellonian kings , while the blind arcades feature rulers from the Piast dynasty .

[ 50 ] Merchants' houses at Old Market Square Most of the tenement façades around the Old Market Square exhibit a Renaissance character. The town hall is surrounded by guild houses from the 16th century, distinguished by a rhythmic arrangement of windows separated by lesenes, as well as decorative attics and rusticated arcades. The façades were often adorned with sgraffito or heraldic motifs — a testament to the decorative and symbolic values of the Renaissance. A distinctive feature is the adaptation of Gothic vaulting structures ( rib vaults ) to the new Renaissance order.

An example of a representative urban residence from Renaissance-era Poznań is the Górka Palace, currently housing the Archaeological Museum. The building was constructed between 1545 and 1549 through the reconstruction of several Gothic townhouses for Andrzej Górka, the Starost General of Greater Poland . The Renaissance entrance portal, made of sandstone , is likely the work of an Italian artist. The entrance archway with a semicircular arch is framed by pilasters supporting a lintel . The rich ornamentation includes laurel leaf festoons , cornucopias , masks, and grotesque-vegetal motifs. The portal leads to an inner courtyard surrounded by a three-winged arcaded cloister . The palace stands out with its architecture that reflects the late Renaissance order on a residential scale and serves as an example of Italian Mannerist influence on 16th-century urban architecture.

[ 51 ] Baroque [ edit ] The Baroque, which began to develop in Poznań in the second half of the 17th century, brought a sense of monumentality to the urban space. The architecture of this period was supported by Counter-Reformation orders and the urban elite. From the Baroque period, the Poznań Fara or Collegiate Basilica of Our Lady of Perpetual Help, St. Mary Magdalene, and St. Stanislaus Bishop stands out as one of the most significant Baroque structures in Poland. The construction of this church began in the mid-17th century under the guidance of prominent Baroque architects such as Giovanni Catenazzi, Tomasz Poncino, and Pompeo Ferrari. The church was finally consecrated in 1705, although it was not fully completed at the time. The interior of the basilica is characterized by a monumental three-aisled layout with a transept and galleries, with columns made of red artificial marble supporting the vaults and organ galleries. One of the most remarkable features is the illusionistic dome — in reality, a painted pseudo-dome on the ceiling that creates an optical impression of depth.

[ 52 ] Many other examples of Baroque sacred architecture have been preserved in Poznań, among which two Franciscan churches stand out. The Church of St. Anthony of Padua , built between 1674 and 1728 according to a design by Jerzy Catenazzi, is a representative example of late Baroque architecture already bearing signs of Classicism . The interior is richly decorated with stuccowork and polychromes executed between 1702 and 1735 by the brothers Adam and Antoni Swach. The paintings in the presbytery and main nave depict scenes from the life of St. Francis , while the Chapel of the Blessed Virgin Mary contains the revered image of Our Lady of Poznań. The Church of St. Francis, originally Gothic , was thoroughly rebuilt in the Baroque style between 1661 and 1668. Its façade, completed in the 18th century, features a characteristic tiered composition with towers rising 29 meters high, topped with roof lanterns and late Baroque domes . Between the pilasters and cornices are niches containing statues of Franciscan saints from 1730. On the southern side adjoins the preserved Chapel of Our Lady of Loreto, dating from the 18th century, which houses a Renaissance-style Holy House modeled after the Santa Casa in Loreto . This church exemplifies the adaptation of a medieval structure to the new Baroque aesthetic.

[ 53 ] [ 54 ] Church of St. Anthony of Padua interior Church of St. Francis Among the examples of secular Baroque architecture, a special place is occupied by the Działyński Palace , built between 1773 and 1776 according to a design by Antoni Höhne. Although the building represents a transitional phase between the Baroque and Classicism, it retains many features characteristic of the late Baroque style. The façade is structured in a classical pilaster order, with symmetrically arranged window openings and a simple crowning cornice . The interior of the palace—particularly the representative Red Hall—features rich stucco decoration in the Rococo style. The hall contains stuccowork likely designed by Jan Chrystian Kamsetzer , along with representations of Kings Stephen Bathory , Władysław IV , and John III Sobieski . Additionally, there are two pairs of sculptures by Augustyn Schöps, depicting Władysław the Elbow-high and Casimir the Great , as well as Władysław Jagiełło and Duke Vytautas . The Red Hall played an important representative role and served as a venue for meetings, lectures, and cultural events.

[ 55 ] Other significant examples of Baroque architecture include the Jesuit College , the Basilica of St. Joseph and the Carmelite Monastery, and the Church of St. Casimir.

Art Nouveau [ edit ] Johow-Gelände, a housing estate implemented according to an urban planning scheme by Max Johow.

The early 20th-century expansion of Poznań to include Jeżyce , Wilda , and Łazarz facilitated the development of new architectural spaces. The demolition of the city's fortifications also allowed for the construction of permanent buildings on former fortress grounds. During this period, numerous new urban developments and residential complexes were established.

[ 56 ] One of them is the so-called Johow-Gelände in the Łazarz district, based on an urban concept by Max Johow, one of the leading architects in Poznań at the beginning of the 20th century. The tenement houses, built in a dense layout without backyards, were preceded by front gardens and, in addition to the high standard of the apartments, also impressed with richly decorated entrance halls and varied building facades. Numerous Art Nouveau tenement houses can also be found on neighboring streets such as Matejki, Wyspiańskiego, and Małeckiego.

[ 56 ] Art Nouveau tenement house at 14 Wolności Square.

In the early 20th century, many residential developments also emerged in the Jeżyce district, including a complex of villa-style tenements on Roosevelta Street, designed by the architectural firm of Herman Böhmer and Paul Preul for the German Civil Servants' Housing Cooperative. Particularly noteworthy are the wrought iron grilles at 5 Roosevelta Street and the oversized bas-relief of a naked woman supporting the balcony on the facade of building number 4. Nearby there is also the New Theatre, constructed in 1906, designed by the same architects, which facade design reflects Art Nouveau typical of the German region, featuring geometric forms with varied colors and textures. Similar architecture can be found in the central part of Jeżyce, along streets such as Dąbrowskiego, Kraszewskiego, Mickiewicza, Prusa, and Słowackiego.

[ 56 ] Among the notable Art Nouveau structures are Oskar Hoffman's tenement house at 69 Święta Marcin Street or tenement house at 14 Wolności Square.

[ 56 ] Imperial District [ edit ] Imperial Castle The Imperial District, also known as the Imperial Forum, was constructed as a prestigious area of Poznań in the early 20th century. The district's creation was driven by the need to improve the city's spatial development, which had been hindered by existing fortifications. In 1902, Emperor Wilhelm II decided to abandon the concept of Poznań as a fortress city and to redevelop it in a residential style. In 1903, architect Josef Stübben presented a plan for the construction of a new district in the area of the demolished Berlin Gate (located at the intersection of today's Święty Marcin and Kościuszki streets), which was realized between 1904 and 1910.

[ 57 ] The central point of this district is the Imperial Castle , built between 1905 and 1910 for Wilhelm II . Over the years, the Castle's purpose has evolved. During the interwar period, university lectures were held in its halls, during World War II , the building was adapted to serve as Hitler 's headquarters, and since the 1960s, it has functioned as a cultural center. Inside, one can find the Pałacowe Cinema, a modern concert hall, exhibition spaces, a library, a bookstore, a café, educational rooms, and areas for visitors to explore the castle's historical rooms.

[ 58 ] The heart of the district is Adam Mickiewicz Square, featuring a monument to the poet. At the boundary of the square and Adam Mickiewicz Park there is a monument commemorating the Victims of June 1956 . The district's buildings are located around the square and along Święty Marcin and Fredry streets.

[ 58 ] In addition to the Imperial Castle, the most important buildings in the Imperial District include:
The Municipal Theater – now the Grand Theater, 1910, architect Max Littmann – inspired by the Villa Rotonda in Vicenza , Collegium Maius (formerly the Colonization Commission ), 1908-1910, with a monument to the founder of the Polish university, Professor Heliodor Święcicki, in front of the building, Adolf Landsberg's Villa, 1911, Institute of Hygiene, 1912, Collegium Minus, 1905-1910, Music Academy (formerly the Evangelical House – Evangelisches Vereinhaus), 1907–1908, Collegium Iuridicum (formerly the Raiffeisen Cooperative Bank), 1907 Poznań Philharmonic , 1910, Post Office Directorate, 1910.

To the west, the district is enclosed by a semicircular line of parks that were created on the site of the 19th-century fortifications of Poznań Fortress . In the following years, an informal university district developed to the south of the Imperial District, featuring buildings of the Music Academy, the University of Economics , and Adam Mickiewicz University .

[ 58 ] Imperial District Grand Theatre Collegium Minus Collegium Maius Poznań Philharmonic Main Post Office Modernism [ edit ] The staircase of the modernist Universal Department Store Okrąglak (1954).

Modern architecture in Poznań began to emerge in the 1930s with buildings like the ZUS office on Dąbrowskiego Street, continuing through the 1980s. The Okrąglak, constructed between 1949 and 1954, is a prominent example, designed by architect Marek Leykam. Built on a circular plan using prefabricated elements, its nine-story cylindrical structure features a flat roof with a central skylight and a surrounding terrace. The facade, without a dominant elevation, is characterized by a glass surface divided by rectangular window openings and vertical "razor blade" partitions.

[ 59 ] Other examples of modernist architecture in Poznań include the Alfa Towers on Święty Marcin and the Poznan University of Physical Education building on Królowej Jadwigi Street. Another important modernist monument is the Arena Hall, which was built in 1974 and was inspired by the shape of the Palazzetto dello Sport, a hall constructed in Rome several years earlier.

[ 59 ] Contemporary Architecture [ edit ] Office buildings near Stary Browar.

The development of postmodernism in Poznań began at the start of the 21st century, primarily influencing office architecture. One of the most acclaimed buildings, which has received numerous awards, is Bałtyk — a 16-story office tower located near Rondo Kaponiera. This project marked the first realization in Poland by one of the world's most renowned architectural firms, MVRDV . The unique form of the building gives it a different appearance from every angle — it appears to expand or contract, simultaneously slender and expansive. Other notable examples of modern architecture include the Porta Posnania , the Andersia office complex , Pixel, and the Nowy Rynek office complex.
