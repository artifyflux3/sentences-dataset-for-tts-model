[ 1 ] Previously, he held the title The Glen A. Lloyd Distinguished Service Professor of Economics.

[ 2 ] In 2007, he was the winner of the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel with Leonid Hurwicz and Eric Maskin for "having laid the foundations of mechanism design theory".

[ 3 ] He was elected a Member of the American Philosophical Society in 2019.

[ 4 ] Biography [ edit ] Roger Myerson was born in 1951 in Boston into a Jewish [ 5 ] family. He attended Harvard University , where he received his A.B.

, summa cum laude , and S.M.

in applied mathematics in 1973. He completed his Ph.D.

in applied mathematics from Harvard University in 1976.

[ 6 ] His doctorate thesis was entitled A Theory of Cooperative Games .

[ 7 ] From 1976 to 2001, Myerson was a professor of economics at Northwestern University 's Kellogg School of Management , where he conducted much of his Nobel-winning research.

[ 8 ] From 1978 to 1979, he was visiting researcher at Bielefeld University . He was visiting professor of economics at the University of Chicago from 1985 to 1986 and from 2000 to 2001. He became professor of economics at Chicago in 2001. Currently, he is the inaugural David L. Pearson Distinguished Service Professor of Global Conflict Studies at the University of Chicago.

[ 9 ] Awards and honors [ edit ] Bank of Sweden Nobel Memorial Prize [ edit ] Myerson was one of the three winners of the 2007 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences , the other two being Leonid Hurwicz of the University of Minnesota , and Eric Maskin of the Institute for Advanced Study . He was awarded the prize for his contributions to mechanism design theory .

[ 10 ] Myerson made a path-breaking contribution to mechanism design theory when he discovered a fundamental connection between the allocation to be implemented and the monetary transfers needed to induce informed agents to reveal their information truthfully. Mechanism design theory allows for people to distinguish situations in which markets work well from those in which they do not. The theory has helped economists identify efficient trading mechanisms, regulation schemes, and voting procedures. Today, the theory plays a central role in many areas of economics and parts of political science .

[ 10 ] Memberships and honors [ edit ] Myerson is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences , the National Academy of Sciences , the Council on Foreign Relations , and the American Philosophical Society .

[ 7 ] He is a Fellow of the Game Theory Society , [ 11 ] and serves as an advisory board member on the International Journal of Game Theory .

[ 12 ] Myerson holds an honorary doctorate from the University of Basel in 2002 [ 13 ] and received the Jean-Jacques Laffont Prize in 2009.

[ 14 ] He also served on the Social Sciences jury for the Infosys Prize in 2016.

Personal life [ edit ] In 1980, Myerson married Regina (née Weber) and the couple had two children, Daniel and Rebecca.

[ 15 ] His daughter, Rebecca, is a health economist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison .

Trump's policies could prove to be inflationary, other economists also warned, such as his proposal to create a 10% across-the-board tariff on all imports to deporting immigrants. The tariff plan would add $1,700 in annual costs for the typical U.S. household, essentially acting as an inflationary tax, according to experts at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
