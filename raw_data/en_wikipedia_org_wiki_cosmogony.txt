**Cosmogony**, also spelled as **cosmogeny**,[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] is any model concerning the origin of the [cosmos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmos "Cosmos") or the [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe "Universe").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmogony#cite_note-DicAstro2-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmogony#cite_note-CosmoToday2-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmogony#cite_note-TU-201409172-3)

The [Big Bang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang "Big Bang") theory, which explains the Evolution of the Universe from a hot and dense state, is widely accepted by physicists.

In [astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy "Astronomy"), cosmogony is the study of the origin of particular astrophysical objects or systems, and is most commonly used in reference to the origin of the universe, the [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System "Solar System"), or the [Earth–Moon system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%E2%80%93Moon_system "Earth–Moon system").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmogony#cite_note-DicAstro2-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmogony#cite_note-CosmoToday2-2) The prevalent [cosmological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_cosmology "Physical cosmology")[model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_theory "Scientific theory") of the early development of the [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe "Universe") is the [Big Bang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang "Big Bang") theory.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmogony#cite_note-Wollack-4)

[Sean M. Carroll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_M._Carroll "Sean M. Carroll"), who specializes in [theoretical cosmology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_cosmology "Physical cosmology") and [field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(physics) "Field (physics)"), explains two competing explanations for the origins of the [singularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_singularity "Gravitational singularity"), which is the center of a space in which a characteristic is limitless[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmogony#cite_note-:0-5) (one example is the singularity of a [black hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole "Black hole"), where [gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity "Gravity") is the characteristic that becomes limitless — infinite).

It is generally accepted that the universe began at a point of singularity. When the universe started to expand, the Big Bang occurred, which evidently began the universe[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]. The other explanation, held by proponents such as [Stephen Hawking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hawking "Stephen Hawking"), asserts that time did not exist when it emerged along with the universe. This assertion implies that the universe does not have a beginning, as time did not exist "prior" to the universe. Hence, it is unclear whether properties such as space or time emerged with the singularity and the known universe.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmogony#cite_note-:0-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmogony#cite_note-:1-6)[_[clarification needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please\_clarify "Wikipedia:Please clarify")_]

Despite the research, there is currently no theoretical model that explains the earliest moments of the universe's existence (during the [Planck epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_epoch "Planck epoch")) due to a lack of a testable theory of [quantum gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_gravity "Quantum gravity"). Nevertheless, researchers of [string theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory "String theory"), its extensions (such as [M-theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-theory "M-theory")), and of [loop quantum cosmology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_quantum_cosmology "Loop quantum cosmology"), like [Barton Zwiebach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barton_Zwiebach "Barton Zwiebach") and Washington Taylor, have proposed solutions to assist in the explanation of the universe's earliest moments.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmogony#cite_note-7) Cosmogonists have only tentative theories for the early stages of the universe and its beginning. The proposed theoretical scenarios include [string theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory "String theory"), M-theory, the [Hartle–Hawking initial state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartle%E2%80%93Hawking_state "Hartle–Hawking state"), [emergent Universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergent_Universe "Emergent Universe"), [string landscape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory_landscape "String theory landscape"), [cosmic inflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_(cosmology) "Inflation (cosmology)"), the [Big Bang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang "Big Bang"), and the [ekpyrotic universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ekpyrotic_universe "Ekpyrotic universe"). Some of these proposed scenarios, like the [string theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory "String theory"), are compatible,[_[clarification needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please\_clarify "Wikipedia:Please clarify")_] whereas others are not.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmogony#cite_note-8)

The [Sumerian tablet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Ashurbanipal "Library of Ashurbanipal") containing parts of the [Eridu Genesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eridu_Genesis "Eridu Genesis")

In mythology, [creation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creation_myth "Creation myth") or cosmogonic myths are narratives describing the beginning of the [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe "Universe") or [cosmos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmos "Cosmos").

Some methods of the creation of the universe in mythology include:

*   the will or action of a [supreme being](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deity "Deity") or beings,
*   the process of [metamorphosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamorphosis "Metamorphosis"),
*   the copulation of female and male [deities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deity "Deity"),
*   from [chaos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_(cosmogony) "Chaos (cosmogony)"),
*   or via a [cosmic egg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_egg "World egg").[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmogony#cite_note-9)

Creation myths may be [etiological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiological_myth "Etiological myth"), attempting to provide explanations for the origin of the universe. For instance, [Eridu Genesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eridu_Genesis "Eridu Genesis"), the oldest known creation myth, contains an account of the creation of the world in which the universe was created out of a primeval sea ([Abzu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abzu "Abzu")).[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmogony#cite_note-10)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmogony#cite_note-11) Creation myths vary, but they may share similar [deities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deity "Deity") or [symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbol "Symbol"). For instance, the ruler of the gods in [Greek mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_mythology "Greek mythology"), [Zeus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeus "Zeus"), is similar to the ruler of the gods in [Roman mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_mythology "Roman mythology"), [Jupiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter_(mythology) "Jupiter (mythology)").[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmogony#cite_note-:3-12) Another example is the ruler of the gods in Tagalog mythology, [Bathala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bathala "Bathala"), who is similar to various rulers of certain pantheons within [Philippine mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine_mythology "Philippine mythology") such as the Bisaya's [Kaptan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine_mythology "Philippine mythology").[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmogony#cite_note-13)[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmogony#cite_note-14)

Compared with cosmology
-----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cosmogony&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Compared with cosmology")]

In the humanities, the distinction between cosmogony and cosmology is blurred. For example, in theology, the [cosmological argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_argument "Cosmological argument") for the existence of God (pre-cosmic cosmogonic bearer of [personhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personhood "Personhood")) is an appeal to ideas concerning the origin of the universe and is thus cosmogonical.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmogony#cite_note-:2-15) Some religious cosmogonies have an impersonal first cause (for example [Taoism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taoism "Taoism")).[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmogony#cite_note-16)

However, in astronomy, cosmogony can be distinguished from [cosmology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology "Cosmology"), which studies the universe and its existence, but does not necessarily inquire into its origins. There is therefore a scientific distinction between cosmological and cosmogonical ideas. [Physical cosmology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_cosmology "Physical cosmology") is the science that attempts to explain all observations relevant to the development and characteristics of the universe on its largest scale. Some questions regarding the behaviour of the universe have been described by some physicists and cosmologists as being [extra-scientific](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-science "Non-science") or [metaphysical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics "Metaphysics"). Attempted solutions to such questions may include the extrapolation of scientific theories to untested regimes (such as the [Planck epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_epoch "Planck epoch")), or the inclusion of philosophical or religious ideas.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmogony#cite_note-:1-6)[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmogony#cite_note-:2-15)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmogony#cite_note-Wollack-4)
