Physical events correspond to mathematical points in time and space, the set of all of them together forming a mathematical model of physical four-dimensional spacetime. The history of an object traces a curve in spacetime, called its world line . If the object has mass , so that its speed is necessarily less than the speed of light , the world line may be parametrized by the proper time of the object. The four-velocity is the rate of change of four-position with respect to the proper time along the curve. The velocity, in contrast, is the rate of change of the position in (three-dimensional) space of the object, as seen by an observer, with respect to the observer's time.

The value of the magnitude of an object's four-velocity, i.e. the quantity obtained by applying the metric tensor g to the four-velocity U , that is ‖ U ‖ 2 = U ⋅ U = g μν U ν U μ , is always equal to ± c 2 , where c is the speed of light. Whether the plus or minus sign applies depends on the choice of metric signature . For an object at rest its four-velocity is parallel to the direction of the time coordinate with U 0 = c . A four-velocity is thus the normalized future-directed timelike tangent vector to a world line, and is a contravariant vector . Though it is a vector, addition of two four-velocities does not yield a four-velocity: the space of four-velocities is not itself a vector space .

[ nb 2 ] Velocity [ edit ] The path of an object in three-dimensional space (in an inertial frame) may be expressed in terms of three spatial coordinate functions x i ( t ) of time t , where i is an index which takes values 1, 2, 3.

The three coordinates form the 3d position vector , written as a column vector x → → ( t ) = [ x 1 ( t ) x 2 ( t ) x 3 ( t ) ] .

{\displaystyle {\vec {x}}(t)={\begin{bmatrix}x^{1}(t)\\[0.7ex]x^{2}(t)\\[0.7ex]x^{3}(t)\end{bmatrix}}\,.} The components of the velocity u → → {\displaystyle {\vec {u}}} (tangent to the curve) at any point on the world line are u → → = [ u 1 u 2 u 3 ] = d x → → d t = [ d x 1 d t d x 2 d t d x 3 d t ] .

{\displaystyle {\vec {u}}={\begin{bmatrix}u^{1}\\u^{2}\\u^{3}\end{bmatrix}}={\frac {d{\vec {x}}}{dt}}={\begin{bmatrix}{\tfrac {dx^{1}}{dt}}\\{\tfrac {dx^{2}}{dt}}\\{\tfrac {dx^{3}}{dt}}\end{bmatrix}}.} Each component is simply written u i = d x i d t {\displaystyle u^{i}={\frac {dx^{i}}{dt}}} Theory of relativity [ edit ] In Einstein's theory of relativity , the path of an object moving relative to a particular frame of reference is defined by four coordinate functions x μ ( τ ) , where μ is a spacetime index which takes the value 0 for the timelike component, and 1, 2, 3 for the spacelike coordinates. The zeroth component is defined as the time coordinate multiplied by c , x 0 = c t , {\displaystyle x^{0}=ct\,,} Each function depends on one parameter τ called its proper time . As a column vector, x = [ x 0 ( τ τ ) x 1 ( τ τ ) x 2 ( τ τ ) x 3 ( τ τ ) ] .

{\displaystyle \mathbf {x} ={\begin{bmatrix}x^{0}(\tau )\\x^{1}(\tau )\\x^{2}(\tau )\\x^{3}(\tau )\\\end{bmatrix}}\,.} Time dilation [ edit ] From time dilation , the differentials in coordinate time t and proper time τ are related by d t = γ γ ( u ) d τ τ {\displaystyle dt=\gamma (u)d\tau } where the Lorentz factor , γ γ ( u ) = 1 1 − − u 2 c 2 , {\displaystyle \gamma (u)={\frac {1}{\sqrt {1-{\frac {u^{2}}{c^{2}}}}}}\,,} is a function of the Euclidean norm u of the 3d velocity vector u → → {\displaystyle {\vec {u}}} : u = ‖ u → → ‖ = ( u 1 ) 2 + ( u 2 ) 2 + ( u 3 ) 2 .

{\displaystyle u=\left\|\ {\vec {u}}\ \right\|={\sqrt {\left(u^{1}\right)^{2}+\left(u^{2}\right)^{2}+\left(u^{3}\right)^{2}}}\,.} Definition of the four-velocity [ edit ] The four-velocity is the tangent four-vector of a timelike world line .
The four-velocity U {\displaystyle \mathbf {U} } at any point of world line X ( τ τ ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {X} (\tau )} is defined as: U = d X d τ τ {\displaystyle \mathbf {U} ={\frac {d\mathbf {X} }{d\tau }}} where X {\displaystyle \mathbf {X} } is the four-position and τ τ {\displaystyle \tau } is the proper time .

[ 1 ] The four-velocity defined here using the proper time of an object does not exist for world lines for massless objects such as photons travelling at the speed of light; nor is it defined for tachyonic world lines, where the tangent vector is spacelike .

Components of the four-velocity [ edit ] The relationship between the time t and the coordinate time x 0 is defined by x 0 = c t .

{\displaystyle x^{0}=ct.} Taking the derivative of this with respect to the proper time τ , we find the U μ velocity component for μ = 0 : U 0 = d x 0 d τ τ = d ( c t ) d τ τ = c d t d τ τ = c γ γ ( u ) {\displaystyle U^{0}={\frac {dx^{0}}{d\tau }}={\frac {d(ct)}{d\tau }}=c{\frac {dt}{d\tau }}=c\gamma (u)} and for the other 3 components to proper time we get the U μ velocity component for μ = 1, 2, 3 : U i = d x i d τ τ = d x i d t d t d τ τ = d x i d t γ γ ( u ) = γ γ ( u ) u i {\displaystyle U^{i}={\frac {dx^{i}}{d\tau }}={\frac {dx^{i}}{dt}}{\frac {dt}{d\tau }}={\frac {dx^{i}}{dt}}\gamma (u)=\gamma (u)u^{i}} where we have used the chain rule and the relationships u i = d x i d t , d t d τ τ = γ γ ( u ) {\displaystyle u^{i}={dx^{i} \over dt}\,,\quad {\frac {dt}{d\tau }}=\gamma (u)} Thus, we find for the four-velocity U {\displaystyle \mathbf {U} } : U = γ γ [ c u → → ] .

{\displaystyle \mathbf {U} =\gamma {\begin{bmatrix}c\\{\vec {u}}\\\end{bmatrix}}.} Written in standard four-vector notation this is: U = γ γ ( c , u → → ) = ( γ γ c , γ γ u → → ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {U} =\gamma \left(c,{\vec {u}}\right)=\left(\gamma c,\gamma {\vec {u}}\right)} where γ γ c {\displaystyle \gamma c} is the temporal component and γ γ u → → {\displaystyle \gamma {\vec {u}}} is the spatial component.

In terms of the synchronized clocks and rulers associated with a particular slice of flat spacetime, the three spacelike components of four-velocity define a traveling object's proper velocity γ γ u → → = d x → → / d τ τ {\displaystyle \gamma {\vec {u}}=d{\vec {x}}/d\tau } i.e. the rate at which distance is covered in the reference map frame per unit proper time elapsed on clocks traveling with the object.

Unlike most other four-vectors, the four-velocity has only 3 independent components u x , u y , u z {\displaystyle u_{x},u_{y},u_{z}} instead of 4.  The γ γ {\displaystyle \gamma } factor is a function of the three-dimensional velocity u → → {\displaystyle {\vec {u}}} .

When certain Lorentz scalars are multiplied by the four-velocity, one then gets new physical four-vectors that have 4 independent components.

For example: Four-momentum : P = m o U = γ γ m o ( c , u → → ) = m ( c , u → → ) = ( m c , m u → → ) = ( m c , p → → ) = ( E c , p → → ) , {\displaystyle \mathbf {P} =m_{o}\mathbf {U} =\gamma m_{o}\left(c,{\vec {u}}\right)=m\left(c,{\vec {u}}\right)=\left(mc,m{\vec {u}}\right)=\left(mc,{\vec {p}}\right)=\left({\frac {E}{c}},{\vec {p}}\right),} where m o {\displaystyle m_{o}} is the rest mass Four-current density : J = ρ ρ o U = γ γ ρ ρ o ( c , u → → ) = ρ ρ ( c , u → → ) = ( ρ ρ c , ρ ρ u → → ) = ( ρ ρ c , j → → ) , {\displaystyle \mathbf {J} =\rho _{o}\mathbf {U} =\gamma \rho _{o}\left(c,{\vec {u}}\right)=\rho \left(c,{\vec {u}}\right)=\left(\rho c,\rho {\vec {u}}\right)=\left(\rho c,{\vec {j}}\right),} where ρ ρ o {\displaystyle \rho _{o}} is the charge density Effectively, the γ γ {\displaystyle \gamma } factor combines with the Lorentz scalar term to make the 4th independent component m = γ γ m o {\displaystyle m=\gamma m_{o}} and ρ ρ = γ γ ρ ρ o .

{\displaystyle \rho =\gamma \rho _{o}.} Magnitude [ edit ] Using the differential of the four-position in the rest frame, the magnitude of the four-velocity can be obtained by the Minkowski metric with signature (−, +, +, +) : ‖ U ‖ 2 = η η μ μ ν ν U μ μ U ν ν = η η μ μ ν ν d X μ μ d τ τ d X ν ν d τ τ = − − c 2 , {\displaystyle \left\|\mathbf {U} \right\|^{2}=\eta _{\mu \nu }U^{\mu }U^{\nu }=\eta _{\mu \nu }{\frac {dX^{\mu }}{d\tau }}{\frac {dX^{\nu }}{d\tau }}=-c^{2}\,,} in short, the magnitude of the four-velocity for any object is always a fixed constant: ‖ U ‖ 2 = − − c 2 {\displaystyle \left\|\mathbf {U} \right\|^{2}=-c^{2}} In a moving frame, the same norm is: ‖ U ‖ 2 = γ γ ( u ) 2 ( − − c 2 + u → → ⋅ ⋅ u → → ) , {\displaystyle \left\|\mathbf {U} \right\|^{2}={\gamma (u)}^{2}\left(-c^{2}+{\vec {u}}\cdot {\vec {u}}\right),} so that: − − c 2 = γ γ ( u ) 2 ( − − c 2 + u → → ⋅ ⋅ u → → ) , {\displaystyle -c^{2}={\gamma (u)}^{2}\left(-c^{2}+{\vec {u}}\cdot {\vec {u}}\right),} which reduces to the definition of the Lorentz factor.

This distinction is significant in general relativity.

^ The set of four-velocities is a subset of the tangent space (which is a vector space) at an event. The label four-vector stems from the behavior under Lorentz transformations , namely under which particular representation they transform.
