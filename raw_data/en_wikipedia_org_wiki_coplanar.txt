In [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry"), a set of points in space are **coplanar** if there exists a geometric [plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(mathematics) "Plane (mathematics)") that contains them all. For example, three points are always coplanar, and if the points are distinct and [non-collinear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-collinear_points "Non-collinear points"), the plane they determine is unique. However, a set of four or more distinct points will, in general, not lie in a single plane.

An example of coplanar points

Two [lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_(geometry) "Line (geometry)") in three-dimensional space are coplanar if there is a plane that includes them both. This occurs if the lines are [parallel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_(geometry) "Parallel (geometry)"), or if they [intersect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line-line_intersection "Line-line intersection") each other. Two lines that are not coplanar are called [skew lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skew_lines "Skew lines").

[Distance geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance_geometry "Distance geometry") provides a solution technique for the problem of determining whether a set of points is coplanar, knowing only the distances between them.

Properties in three dimensions
------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Coplanarity&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Properties in three dimensions")]

In three-dimensional space, two [linearly independent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linearly_independent "Linearly independent") vectors with the same initial point determine a plane through that point. Their [cross product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_product "Cross product") is a [normal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_(geometry) "Normal (geometry)") vector to that plane, and any vector [orthogonal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal "Orthogonal") to this cross product through the initial point will lie in the plane.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coplanar#cite_note-1) This leads to the following coplanarity test using a [scalar triple product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_triple_product "Scalar triple product"):

Four distinct points, _x_ 1, _x_ 2, _x_ 3, _x_ 4, are coplanar if and only if,

![Image 2: {\displaystyle [(x_{2}-x_{1})\times (x_{4}-x_{1})]\cdot (x_{3}-x_{1})=0.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/40301d3d515637e356b2c4bbc59752c0af16aed8)
which is also equivalent to

![Image 3: {\displaystyle (x_{2}-x_{1})\cdot [(x_{4}-x_{1})\times (x_{3}-x_{1})]=0.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3db4d390d2bc551af8977323d5309a3cfbfc3b82)
If three vectors **a**, **b**, **c** are coplanar, then if **a** ⋅ **b** = 0 (i.e., **a** and **b** are orthogonal) then

![Image 4: {\displaystyle (\mathbf {c} \cdot \mathbf {\hat {a}} )\mathbf {\hat {a}} +(\mathbf {c} \cdot \mathbf {\hat {b}} )\mathbf {\hat {b}} =\mathbf {c} ,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/306f1f9591e8d275df04d45917f917f9daa15a5b)
where ⁠![Image 5: {\displaystyle \mathbf {\hat {a}} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/82046f08c1b728dc4693b8a35ae0706e51e54ef0)⁠ denotes the [unit vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_vector "Unit vector") in the [direction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direction_(geometry) "Direction (geometry)") of **a**. That is, the [vector projections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_projection "Vector projection") of **c** on **a** and **c** on **b** add to give the original **c**.

Coplanarity of points in _n_ dimensions whose coordinates are given
-------------------------------------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Coplanarity&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Coplanarity of points in n dimensions whose coordinates are given")]

Since three or fewer points are always coplanar, the problem of determining when a set of points are coplanar is generally of interest only when there are at least four points involved. In the case that there are exactly four points, several _ad hoc_ methods can be employed, but a general method that works for any number of points uses vector methods and the property that a plane is determined by two [linearly independent vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linearly_independent_vectors "Linearly independent vectors").

In an n-dimensional space where _n_ ≥ 3, a set of k points ![Image 6: {\displaystyle \{p_{0},\ p_{1},\ \dots ,\ p_{k-1}\}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8156e81185fcb4ef3527dcc3fea81b945214037b) are coplanar if and only if the matrix of their relative differences, that is, the matrix whose columns (or rows) are the vectors ![Image 7: {\overrightarrow {p_{0}p_{1}}},\ {\overrightarrow {p_{0}p_{2}}},\ \dots ,\ {\overrightarrow {p_{0}p_{k-1}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/923c85e4c287cca54c17d9be68bbac530a7a022f) is of [rank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rank_(linear_algebra) "Rank (linear algebra)") 2 or less.

For example, given four points

![Image 8: {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}X&=(x_{1},x_{2},\dots ,x_{n}),\\Y&=(y_{1},y_{2},\dots ,y_{n}),\\Z&=(z_{1},z_{2},\dots ,z_{n}),\\W&=(w_{1},w_{2},\dots ,w_{n}),\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4159a67eba158aeffa7867993c961c2a49dfa392)
if the [matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics) "Matrix (mathematics)")

![Image 9: {\displaystyle {\begin{bmatrix}x_{1}-w_{1}&x_{2}-w_{2}&\dots &x_{n}-w_{n}\\y_{1}-w_{1}&y_{2}-w_{2}&\dots &y_{n}-w_{n}\\z_{1}-w_{1}&z_{2}-w_{2}&\dots &z_{n}-w_{n}\\\end{bmatrix}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3d276d692427c743052badfd1f197a1ee7810fea)
is of rank 2 or less, the four points are coplanar.

In the special case of a plane that contains the origin, the property can be simplified in the following way: A set of k points and the origin are coplanar if and only if the matrix of the coordinates of the k points is of rank 2 or less.

A [skew polygon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skew_polygon "Skew polygon") is a [polygon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon "Polygon") whose [vertices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_(geometry) "Vertex (geometry)") are not coplanar. Such a polygon must have at least four vertices; there are no skew triangles.

A [polyhedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyhedron "Polyhedron") that has positive [volume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume "Volume") has vertices that are not all coplanar.
