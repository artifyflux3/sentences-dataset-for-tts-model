Pacific Northwest windstorms , sometimes colloquially known as Big Blows , [ 1 ] are extratropical cyclones which form in the Pacific basin, and affect land areas in the Pacific Northwest of the United States and British Columbia , Canada . They form as cyclonic windstorms associated with areas of low atmospheric pressure that track across the North Pacific Ocean towards western North America. Deep low pressure areas are relatively common over the North Pacific. They are most common in the winter months. On average, the month when most windstorms form is November or December.

The closest analogue to these storms are European windstorms , which develop over the eastern portion of the North Atlantic Ocean as opposed to the North Pacific.

[ 2 ] Nor'easters , a similar class of extratropical cyclones, commonly affect the east coast of North America. While the storms on the East Coast are named "nor'easters", the Pacific Northwest windstorms are not called "nor'westers" because the cyclones' primary winds can blow from any direction, while the primary winds in nor'easters usually blow from the northeast.

[ 3 ] The largest storm events have struck the Pacific Northwest every 15 to 30 years according to modern records. Among the strongest were the 1962 Columbus Day storm , which formed from the remnants of Typhoon Frieda/Freda and killed 50 people; the 1993 Inauguration Day windstorm, which killed 6 people; and the 2006 Hanukkah Eve windstorm , which killed 14 people and caused widespread power outages for 11 days.

Claimed six lives, [ 8 ] 750,000 homes and businesses without power with total damage in western Washington of $130 million.

[ 9 ] Also caused $500,000 in damage to the Evergreen Point Floating Bridge.

[ 10 ] 1995: December 11–12 [ 11 ] 1999: March 2–3, 1999 [ 12 ] 2000: January 16, 2000 [ 13 ] 2002: South Valley Surprise of 2002 2006: The Hannukah Eve windstorm [ 14 ] caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damage, left over 1.8 million residences and businesses without power, and killed eighteen. Most deaths were caused by carbon monoxide poisoning in the days following the storm because of improper use of barbecue cookers and generators indoors.

2007: Great Coastal Gale of 2007 2012: November 19 2013: Remnants of Typhoon Pabuk on September 28–29, 2013 caused heavy rain in Portland, Oregon had the wettest September ever on record. The moisture from the Pineapple Express coming from Hawaii.

2014: December 11: Brought the strongest recorded wind gust to Portland since 1995, of 59 MPH 2015: August 29–30 windstorm knocking out power to 710,000 customers in British Columbia's Lower Mainland region. Several municipalities in Metro Vancouver were without power for three days; at the time it was the largest outage in BC Hydro 's recorded history.

[ 15 ] [ 16 ] 2015, December 21 2016: March 9 2016: Ides of October storm , Typhoon Songda transitioned into an extratropical storm as it crossed the North Pacific and approached the west coast of North America. Originally, expected to be a historic windstorm to make a direct hit on Washington State, the worst of the storm ended up staying offshore. Despite this, coastal regions reported winds as high as 100 mph and an EF-2 tornado touched down in Manzanita.

[ 17 ] 2018: December 20, as winds approached (and occasionally exceeded) 100 km/h, trees came down, high seas cancelled ferries and over 750,000 customers in British Columbia lost power; causing the largest outage in BC Hydro's recorded history.

[ 18 ] One man needed to be rescued by helicopter from the damaged White Rock Pier and a woman was killed in Duncan after being struck by a tree.

[ 19 ] 2021: October 2021 Northeast Pacific bomb cyclone . Powerful storm system that underwent rapid bombogenesis with air pressure bottoming out at 942 hPa . Heavy rain and snow along with strong winds were reported.
