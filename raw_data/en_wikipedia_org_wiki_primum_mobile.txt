( November 2024 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) The angel of the Primum Mobile from the E-Series of the so-called Mantegna Tarocchi In classical, medieval, and Renaissance astronomy , the Primum Mobile ( Latin : "first movable") was the outermost moving sphere in the geocentric model of the universe .

[ 1 ] The concept was introduced by Ptolemy to account for the apparent daily motion of the heavens around the Earth, producing the east-to-west rising and setting of the sun and stars, and reached Western Europe via Avicenna .

[ 2 ] Appearance and rotation [ edit ] The Ptolemaic system presented a view of the universe in which apparent motion was taken for real – a viewpoint still maintained in common speech through such everyday terms as moonrise and sunset .

[ 3 ] Rotation of the Earth on its polar axis – as seen in a heliocentric solar system, which (while anticipated by Aristarchus ) was not to be widely accepted until well after Copernicus [ 3 ] – leads to what earlier astronomers saw as the real movement of all the heavenly bodies around the Earth every 24 hours.

[ 4 ] Astronomers believed that the seven naked-eye planets (including the Moon and the Sun) were carried around the spherical Earth on invisible orbs, while an eighth sphere contained the fixed stars . Motion was provided to the whole system by the Primum Mobile, itself set within the Empyrean , and the fastest moving of all the spheres.

[ 5 ] Spherical variations [ edit ] One scheme of the celestial spheres The total number of celestial spheres was not fixed. In this 16th-century illustration, the firmament (sphere of fixed stars) is eighth, a "crystalline" sphere (posited to account for the reference to "waters ... above the firmament" in Genesis 1:7) is ninth, and the Primum Mobile is tenth. Outside all is the Empyrean , the "habitation of God and all the elect ".

Copernicus and after [ edit ] Copernicus accepted existence of the sphere of the fixed stars, and (more ambiguously) that of the Primum Mobile, [ 6 ] as too (initially) did Galileo [ 7 ] – though he would later challenge its necessity in a heliocentric system.

[ 8 ] Francis Bacon was as sceptical of the Primum Mobile as he was of the rotation of the earth.

[ 9 ] Once Kepler had made the sun, not the Primum Mobile, the cause of planetary motion, however, [ 10 ] the Primum Mobile gradually declined into the realm of metaphor or literary allusion.

Literary references [ edit ] Dante made the Primum Mobile the ninth of the ten heavens into which he divided his Paradiso .

[ 11 ] In Geoffrey Chaucer 's " Man of Law's Tale ", the Primum Mobile is apostrophized: "O firste moevyng! crueel firmament, / With thy diurnal sweigh that crowdest ay / And hurlest al from est til occident / That naturelly wolde holde another way ..." (ll. 295–298).

[ 12 ] W. B. Yeats wrote: "The Primum Mobile that fashioned us / Has made the very owls in circles move." [ 13 ] John Ciardi wrote: "One night I dreamed I was locked in my Father's watch / With Ptolemy and twenty-one ruby stars / Mounted on spheres and the Primum Mobile / Coiled and gleaming to the end of space."
