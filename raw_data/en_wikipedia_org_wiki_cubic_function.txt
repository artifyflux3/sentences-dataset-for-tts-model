The case shown has two critical points . Here the function is f ( x ) = ( x 3 + 3 x 2 − 6 x − 8)/4 .

In mathematics , a cubic function is a function of the form f ( x ) = a x 3 + b x 2 + c x + d , {\displaystyle f(x)=ax^{3}+bx^{2}+cx+d,} that is, a polynomial function of degree three. In many texts, the coefficients a , b , c , and d are supposed to be real numbers , and the function is considered as a real function that maps real numbers to real numbers or as a complex function that maps complex numbers to complex numbers. In other cases, the coefficients may be complex numbers, and the function is a complex function that has the set of the complex numbers as its codomain , even when the domain is restricted to the real numbers.

Setting f ( x ) = 0 produces a cubic equation of the form a x 3 + b x 2 + c x + d = 0 , {\displaystyle ax^{3}+bx^{2}+cx+d=0,} whose solutions are called roots of the function. The derivative of a cubic function is a quadratic function .

A cubic function with real coefficients has either one or three real roots ( which may not be distinct ); [ 1 ] all odd-degree polynomials with real coefficients have at least one real root.

The graph of a cubic function always has a single inflection point . It may have two critical points , a local minimum and a local maximum. Otherwise, a cubic function is monotonic . The graph of a cubic function is symmetric with respect to its inflection point; that is, it is invariant under a rotation of a half turn around this point.

Up to an affine transformation , there are only three possible graphs for cubic functions.

Cubic functions are fundamental for cubic interpolation .

History [ edit ] Main article: Cubic equation § History Critical and inflection points [ edit ] The roots , stationary points , inflection point and concavity of a cubic polynomial x 3 − 6 x 2 + 9 x − 4 (solid black curve) and its first (dashed red) and second (dotted orange) derivatives .

The critical points of a cubic function are its stationary points , that is the points where the slope of the function is zero.

[ 2 ] Thus the critical points of a cubic function f defined by f ( x ) = ax 3 + bx 2 + cx + d , occur at values of x such that the derivative 3 a x 2 + 2 b x + c = 0 {\displaystyle 3ax^{2}+2bx+c=0} of the cubic function is zero.

The solutions of this equation are the x -values of the critical points and are given, using the quadratic formula , by x critical = − − b ± ± b 2 − − 3 a c 3 a .

{\displaystyle x_{\text{critical}}={\frac {-b\pm {\sqrt {b^{2}-3ac}}}{3a}}.} The sign of the expression Δ 0 = b 2 − 3 ac inside the square root determines the number of critical points. If it is positive, then there are two critical points, one is a local maximum, and the other is a local minimum. If b 2 − 3 ac = 0 , then there is only one critical point, which is an inflection point . If b 2 − 3 ac < 0 , then there are no (real) critical points. In the two latter cases, that is, if b 2 − 3 ac is nonpositive, the cubic function is strictly monotonic . See the figure for an example of the case Δ 0 > 0 .

The inflection point of a function is where that function changes concavity .

[ 3 ] An inflection point occurs when the second derivative f ″ ( x ) = 6 a x + 2 b , {\displaystyle f''(x)=6ax+2b,} is zero, and the third derivative is nonzero. Thus a cubic function has always a single inflection point, which occurs at x inflection = − − b 3 a .

{\displaystyle x_{\text{inflection}}=-{\frac {b}{3a}}.} Classification [ edit ] Cubic functions of the form y = x 3 + c x .

{\displaystyle y=x^{3}+cx.} The graph of any cubic function is similar to such a curve.

The graph of a cubic function is a cubic curve , though many cubic curves are not graphs of functions.

Although cubic functions depend on four parameters, their graph can have only very few shapes. In fact, the graph of a cubic function is always similar to the graph of a function of the form y = x 3 + p x .

{\displaystyle y=x^{3}+px.} This similarity can be built as the composition of translations parallel to the coordinates axes, a homothecy ( uniform scaling ), and, possibly, a reflection ( mirror image ) with respect to the y -axis. A further non-uniform scaling can transform the graph into the graph of one among the three cubic functions y = x 3 + x y = x 3 y = x 3 − − x .

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}y&=x^{3}+x\\y&=x^{3}\\y&=x^{3}-x.\end{aligned}}} This means that there are only three graphs of cubic functions up to an affine transformation .

The above geometric transformations can be built in the following way, when starting from a general cubic function y = a x 3 + b x 2 + c x + d .

{\displaystyle y=ax^{3}+bx^{2}+cx+d.} Firstly, if a < 0 , the change of variable x → − x allows supposing a > 0 . After this change of variable, the new graph is the mirror image of the previous one, with respect of the y -axis.

Then, the change of variable x = x 1 − ⁠ b / 3 a ⁠ provides a function of the form y = a x 1 3 + p x 1 + q .

{\displaystyle y=ax_{1}^{3}+px_{1}+q.} This corresponds to a translation parallel to the x -axis.

The change of variable y = y 1 + q corresponds to a translation with respect to the y -axis, and gives a function of the form y 1 = a x 1 3 + p x 1 .

{\displaystyle y_{1}=ax_{1}^{3}+px_{1}.} The change of variable x 1 = x 2 a , y 1 = y 2 a {\displaystyle \textstyle x_{1}={\frac {x_{2}}{\sqrt {a}}},y_{1}={\frac {y_{2}}{\sqrt {a}}}} corresponds to a uniform scaling, and give, after multiplication by a , {\displaystyle {\sqrt {a}},} a function of the form y 2 = x 2 3 + p x 2 , {\displaystyle y_{2}=x_{2}^{3}+px_{2},} which is the simplest form that can be obtained by a similarity.

Then, if p ≠ 0 , the non-uniform scaling x 2 = x 3 | p | , y 2 = y 3 | p | 3 {\displaystyle \textstyle x_{2}=x_{3}{\sqrt {|p|}},\quad y_{2}=y_{3}{\sqrt {|p|^{3}}}} gives, after division by | p | 3 , {\displaystyle \textstyle {\sqrt {|p|^{3}}},} y 3 = x 3 3 + x 3 sgn ⁡ ⁡ ( p ) , {\displaystyle y_{3}=x_{3}^{3}+x_{3}\operatorname {sgn}(p),} where sgn ⁡ ⁡ ( p ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {sgn}(p)} has the value 1 or −1, depending on the sign of p . If one defines sgn ⁡ ⁡ ( 0 ) = 0 , {\displaystyle \operatorname {sgn}(0)=0,} the latter form of the function applies to all cases (with x 2 = x 3 {\displaystyle x_{2}=x_{3}} and y 2 = y 3 {\displaystyle y_{2}=y_{3}} ).

Symmetry [ edit ] For a cubic function of the form y = x 3 + p x , {\displaystyle y=x^{3}+px,} the inflection point is thus the origin. As such a function is an odd function , its graph is symmetric with respect to the inflection point, and invariant under a rotation of a half turn around the inflection point. As these properties are invariant by similarity , the following is true for all cubic functions.

The graph of a cubic function is symmetric with respect to its inflection point, and is invariant under a rotation of a half turn around the inflection point.

Collinearities [ edit ] The points P 1 , P 2 , and P 3 (in blue) are collinear and belong to the graph of x 3 + ⁠ 3 / 2 ⁠ x 2 − ⁠ 5 / 2 ⁠ x + ⁠ 5 / 4 ⁠ . The points T 1 , T 2 , and T 3 (in red) are the intersections of the (dotted) tangent lines to the graph at these points with the graph itself. They are collinear too.

The tangent lines to the graph of a cubic function at three collinear points intercept the cubic again at collinear points.

[ 4 ] This can be seen as follows.

As this property is invariant under a rigid motion , one may suppose that the function has the form f ( x ) = x 3 + p x .

{\displaystyle f(x)=x^{3}+px.} If α is a real number, then the tangent to the graph of f at the point ( α , f ( α )) is the line {( x , f ( α ) + ( x − α ) f ′( α )) : x ∈ R } .

So, the intersection point between this line and the graph of f can be obtained solving the equation f ( x ) = f ( α ) + ( x − α ) f ′( α ) , that is x 3 + p x = α α 3 + p α α + ( x − − α α ) ( 3 α α 2 + p ) , {\displaystyle x^{3}+px=\alpha ^{3}+p\alpha +(x-\alpha )(3\alpha ^{2}+p),} which can be rewritten x 3 − − 3 α α 2 x + 2 α α 3 = 0 , {\displaystyle x^{3}-3\alpha ^{2}x+2\alpha ^{3}=0,} and factorized as ( x − − α α ) 2 ( x + 2 α α ) = 0.

{\displaystyle (x-\alpha )^{2}(x+2\alpha )=0.} So, the tangent intercepts the cubic at ( − − 2 α α , − − 8 α α 3 − − 2 p α α ) = ( − − 2 α α , − − 8 f ( α α ) + 6 p α α ) .

{\displaystyle (-2\alpha ,-8\alpha ^{3}-2p\alpha )=(-2\alpha ,-8f(\alpha )+6p\alpha ).} So, the function that maps a point ( x , y ) of the graph to the other point where the tangent intercepts the graph is ( x , y ) ↦ ↦ ( − − 2 x , − − 8 y + 6 p x ) .

{\displaystyle (x,y)\mapsto (-2x,-8y+6px).} This is an affine transformation that transforms collinear points into collinear points. This proves the claimed result.

Cubic interpolation [ edit ] Main article: Spline interpolation Given the values of a function and its derivative at two points, there is exactly one cubic function that has the same four values, which is called a cubic Hermite spline .

There are two standard ways for using this fact. Firstly, if one knows, for example by physical measurement, the values of a function and its derivative at some sampling points, one can interpolate the function with a continuously differentiable function , which is a piecewise cubic function.

If the value of a function is known at several points, cubic interpolation consists in approximating the function by a continuously differentiable function , which is piecewise cubic. For having a uniquely defined interpolation, two more constraints must be added, such as the values of the derivatives at the endpoints, or a zero curvature at the endpoints.
