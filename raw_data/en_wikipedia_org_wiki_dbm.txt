A schematic showing the relationship between dBu (the voltage source ) and dBm (the power dissipated as heat by the 600 Ω resistor ) dBm or dB mW (decibel-milliwatts) is a unit of power level expressed using a logarithmic decibel (dB) scale respective to one milliwatt (mW). It is commonly used by radio, microwave and fiber-optical communication technicians & engineers to measure the power of system transmissions on a log scale , which can express both very large and very small values in a short form.

dBW is a similar unit measured relative to one watt (1000 mW) rather than a milliwatt.

The decibel ( dB ) is a dimensionless unit , used for quantifying the ratio between two values, such as signal-to-noise ratio . The dBm is also dimensionless, [ 1 ] [ 2 ] but since it compares to a fixed reference value, the dBm quantity is an absolute one.

The dBm is not a part of the International System of Units (SI) and therefore is discouraged from use in documents or systems that adhere to SI units. (The corresponding SI unit is the watt.) However, the unit decibel (dB) for relative quantities, without any suffix, is a non-SI unit that is accepted for use alongside SI units . The level of a power P of ten decibels relative to one milliwatt may be written L P /(1 mW) = 10 dB to comply with the SI.

[ 3 ] In audio and telephony, dBm is typically referenced relative to the 600-ohm impedance [ 4 ] commonly used in telephone voice networks, while in radio-frequency work dBm is typically referenced relative to a 50-ohm impedance.

[ 5 ] Unit conversions [ edit ] A power level of 0 dBm corresponds to a power of 1 milliwatt. An increase in level of 10 dB is equivalent to a ten-fold increase in power. Therefore, a 20 dB increase in level is equivalent to a 100-fold increase in power. A 3 dB increase in level is approximately equivalent to doubling the power, which means that a level of 3 dBm corresponds roughly to a power of 2 mW. Similarly, for each 3 dB decrease in level, the power is reduced by about one half, making −3 dBm correspond to a power of about 0.5 mW.

To express an arbitrary power P in mW as x in dBm, the following expression may be used: [ 6 ] x = 10 log 10 ⁡ ⁡ P 1 mW {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}x&=10\log _{10}{\frac {P}{1~{\text{mW}}}}\end{aligned}}} Conversely, to express an arbitrary power level x in dBm, as P in mW: P = 1 mW ⋅ ⋅ 10 x / 10 {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}P&=1~{\text{mW}}\cdot 10^{{x}/{10}}\end{aligned}}} Table of examples [ edit ] Below is a table summarizing useful cases: Main article: Orders of magnitude (power) Power level Power Notes 526 dBm 3.6 × 10 49 W Black hole collision , the power radiated in gravitational waves following the collision GW150914 , estimated at 50 times the power output of all the stars in the observable universe [ 7 ] [ 8 ] 420 dBm 1 × 10 39 W Cygnus A , one of the most powerful radio sources in the sky 296 dBm 3.846 × 10 26 W Total power output of the Sun [ 9 ] 120 dBm 1 GW Experimental high-power microwave (HPM) generation system, 1 GW at 2.32 GHz for 38 ns [ 10 ] 105 dBm 32 MW AN/FPS-85 Phased Array Space Surveillance Radar , claimed by the US Space Force as the most powerful radar in the world [ 11 ] 95.5 dBm 3600 kW High-frequency Active Auroral Research Program maximum power output, the most powerful shortwave station in 2012 80 dBm 100 kW Typical transmission power of FM radio station with 50-kilometre (31 mi) range 62 dBm 1.588 kW 1.5 kW is the maximum legal power output of a US ham radio station.

In United States Department of Defense practice, unweighted measurement is normally understood, applicable to a certain bandwidth , which must be stated or implied.

[ citation needed ] In European practice, psophometric weighting may be, as indicated by context, equivalent to dBm0p , which is preferred.

[ citation needed ] In audio, 0 dBm often corresponds to approximately 0.775 volts, since 0.775 V dissipates 1 mW in a 600 Ω load.

[ 16 ] The corresponding voltage level is 0 dBu , without the 600 Ω restriction. Conversely, for RF situations with a 50 Ω load, 0 dBm corresponds to approximately 0.224 volts, since 0.224 V dissipates 1 mW in a 50 Ω load.

[ citation needed ] In general the relationship between the level of a power P in dBm and the RMS voltage V in volts across a load of resistance R (typically used to terminate a transmission line with impedance Z ) is: V = R 10 P / 10 1000 .

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}V&={\sqrt {R{\frac {10^{P/10}}{1000}}}}\,.\end{aligned}}} Expression in dBm is typically used for optical and electrical power measurements, not for other types of power (such as thermal). A listing by power levels in watts is available that includes a variety of examples not necessarily related to electrical or optical power.

The dBm was first proposed as an industry standard [ 16 ] in 1940.
