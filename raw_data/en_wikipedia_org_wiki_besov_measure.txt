( November 2015 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) In mathematics ‚Äî specifically, in the fields of probability theory and inverse problems ‚Äî Besov measures and associated Besov-distributed random variables are generalisations of the notions of Gaussian measures and random variables , Laplace distributions , and other classical distributions.  They are particularly useful in the study of inverse problems on function spaces for which a Gaussian Bayesian prior is an inappropriate model.  The construction of a Besov measure is similar to the construction of a Besov space , hence the nomenclature.

Definitions [ edit ] Let H {\displaystyle H} be a separable Hilbert space of functions defined on a domain D ‚äÜ ‚äÜ R d {\displaystyle D\subseteq \mathbb {R} ^{d}} , and let { e n ‚à£ ‚à£ n ‚àà ‚àà N } {\displaystyle \{e_{n}\mid n\in \mathbb {N} \}} be a complete orthonormal basis for H {\displaystyle H} .  Let s ‚àà ‚àà R {\displaystyle s\in \mathbb {R} } and 1 ‚â§ ‚â§ p < ‚àû ‚àû {\displaystyle 1\leq p<\infty } .  For u = ‚àë ‚àë n ‚àà ‚àà N u n e n ‚àà ‚àà H {\displaystyle u=\sum _{n\in \mathbb {N} }u_{n}e_{n}\in H} , define ‚Äñ ‚Äñ u ‚Äñ ‚Äñ X s , p = ‚Äñ ‚àë ‚àë n ‚àà ‚àà N u n e n ‚Äñ X s , p := ( ‚àë ‚àë n = 1 ‚àû ‚àû n ( p s d + p 2 ‚àí ‚àí 1 ) | u n | p ) 1 / p .

{\displaystyle \|u\|_{X^{s,p}}=\left\|\sum _{n\in \mathbb {N} }u_{n}e_{n}\right\|_{X^{s,p}}:=\left(\sum _{n=1}^{\infty }n^{({\frac {ps}{d}}+{\frac {p}{2}}-1)}|u_{n}|^{p}\right)^{1/p}.} This defines a norm on the subspace of H {\displaystyle H} for which it is finite, and we let X s , p {\displaystyle X^{s,p}} denote the completion of this subspace with respect to this new norm.  The motivation for these definitions arises from the fact that ‚Äñ ‚Äñ u ‚Äñ ‚Äñ X s , p {\displaystyle \|u\|_{X^{s,p}}} is equivalent to the norm of u {\displaystyle u} in the Besov space B p p s ( D ) {\displaystyle B_{pp}^{s}(D)} .

Let Œ∫ Œ∫ > 0 {\displaystyle \kappa >0} be a scale parameter, similar to the precision (the reciprocal of the variance ) of a Gaussian measure.  We now define a X s , p {\displaystyle X^{s,p}} -valued random variable u {\displaystyle u} by u := ‚àë ‚àë n ‚àà ‚àà N n ‚àí ‚àí ( s d + 1 2 ‚àí ‚àí 1 p ) Œ∫ Œ∫ ‚àí ‚àí 1 p Œæ Œæ n e n , {\displaystyle u:=\sum _{n\in \mathbb {N} }n^{-({\frac {s}{d}}+{\frac {1}{2}}-{\frac {1}{p}})}\kappa ^{-{\frac {1}{p}}}\xi _{n}e_{n},} where Œæ Œæ 1 , Œæ Œæ 2 , ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ {\displaystyle \xi _{1},\xi _{2},\dots } are sampled independently and identically from the generalized Gaussian measure on R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } with Lebesgue probability density function proportional to exp ‚Å° ‚Å° ( ‚àí ‚àí 1 2 | Œæ Œæ n | p ) {\displaystyle \exp(-{\tfrac {1}{2}}|\xi _{n}|^{p})} .  Informally, u {\displaystyle u} can be said to have a probability density function proportional to exp ‚Å° ‚Å° ( ‚àí ‚àí Œ∫ Œ∫ 2 ‚Äñ ‚Äñ u ‚Äñ ‚Äñ X s , p p ) {\displaystyle \exp(-{\tfrac {\kappa }{2}}\|u\|_{X^{s,p}}^{p})} with respect to infinite-dimensional Lebesgue measure ( which does not make rigorous sense ), and is therefore a natural candidate for a "typical" element of X s , p {\displaystyle X^{s,p}} (although this Is not quite true ‚Äî see below).

Properties [ edit ] It is easy to show that, when t ‚â§ s , the X t , p norm is finite whenever the X s , p norm is.  Therefore, the spaces X s , p and X t , p are nested: X s , p ‚äÜ ‚äÜ X t , p when t ‚â§ ‚â§ s .

{\displaystyle X^{s,p}\subseteq X^{t,p}{\mbox{ when }}t\leq s.} This is consistent with the usual nesting of smoothness classes of functions f : D ‚Üí R :
for example, the Sobolev space H 2 ( D ) is a subspace of H 1 ( D ) and in turn of the Lebesgue space L 2 ( D ) = H 0 ( D ); the H√∂lder space C 1 ( D ) of continuously differentiable functions is a subspace of the space C 0 ( D ) of continuous functions.

It can be shown that the series defining u converges in X t , p almost surely for any t < s ‚àí d / p , and therefore gives a well-defined X t , p -valued random variable. Note that X t , p is a larger space than X s , p , and in fact thee random variable u is almost surely not in the smaller space X s , p . The space X s , p is rather the Cameron-Martin space of this probability measure in the Gaussian case p =¬†2. The random variable u is said to be Besov distributed with parameters ( Œ∫ , s , p ), and the induced probability measure is called a Besov measure .
