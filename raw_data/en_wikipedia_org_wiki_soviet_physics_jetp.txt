230707316 Links Journal homepage Springer homepage The Journal of Experimental and Theoretical Physics ( JETP ) [ Russian : Журнал Экспериментальной и Теоретической Физики ( ЖЭТФ ), or Zhurnal Éksperimental'noĭ i Teoreticheskoĭ Fiziki ( ZhÉTF )] is a peer-reviewed Russian bilingual scientific journal covering all areas of experimental and theoretical physics . For example, coverage includes solid-state physics , elementary particles , and cosmology . The journal is published simultaneously in both Russian and English languages. 
The previous editor-in-chief was Alexander F. Andreev , today the editor-in-chief is Alexander Ivanovich Smirnov.

[ 1 ] In addition, this journal is a continuation of Soviet physics, JETP (1931–1992), [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] which began English translation in 1955.
