There were 15 episodes, in which Magee interviewed noted philosophers.

Overview [ edit ] The first episode, "Introduction to Philosophy", saw Magee in discussion with Isaiah Berlin . In subsequent episodes Magee discussed such topics as Marxist philosophy , the Frankfurt School , and modern Existentialism .

During the broadcast run, edited shorter versions of the discussions were published in The Listener magazine.

[ 1 ] Extensively revised versions of the dialogues within the Men of Ideas series were published in a 1979 book of the same name, [ 2 ] now published under the title Talking Philosophy .

[ 3 ] DVDs of the series are sold to academic institutions with the title Contemporary Philosophy.

[ 4 ] Noting that the series "attracted a steady one million viewers per show", The Daily Telegraph hailed the series, and its 1987 'sequel', for achieving "the near-impossible feat of presenting to a mass audience recondite issues of philosophy without compromising intellectual integrity or losing ratings." [ 5 ] Neither this series nor The Great Philosophers , a similar BBC television series presented by Magee in 1987, are available for purchase by home users. Since March 2023, however, all episodes have been made freely available on YouTube .

[ 6 ] The theme played over the opening credits comes from the overture to Gabriel Fauré 's Masques et Bergamasques .
