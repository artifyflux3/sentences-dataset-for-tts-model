It is a characterization of the convergence in L p in terms of convergence in measure and a condition related to uniform integrability .

Preliminary definitions [ edit ] Let ( X , A , μ μ ) {\displaystyle (X,{\mathcal {A}},\mu )} be a measure space , i.e.

μ μ : A → → [ 0 , ∞ ∞ ] {\displaystyle \mu :{\mathcal {A}}\to [0,\infty ]} is a set function such that μ μ ( ∅ ∅ ) = 0 {\displaystyle \mu (\emptyset )=0} and μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } is countably-additive. All functions considered in the sequel will be functions f : X → → K {\displaystyle f:X\to \mathbb {K} } , where K = R {\displaystyle \mathbb {K} =\mathbb {R} } or C {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} } . We adopt the following definitions according to Bogachev's terminology.

[ 1 ] A set of functions F ⊂ ⊂ L 1 ( X , A , μ μ ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}\subset L^{1}(X,{\mathcal {A}},\mu )} is called uniformly integrable if lim M → → + ∞ ∞ sup f ∈ ∈ F ∫ ∫ { | f | > M } | f | d μ μ = 0 {\displaystyle \lim _{M\to +\infty }\sup _{f\in {\mathcal {F}}}\int _{\{|f|>M\}}|f|\,d\mu =0} , i.e ∀ ∀ ε ε > 0 , ∃ ∃ M ε ε > 0 : sup f ∈ ∈ F ∫ ∫ { | f | ≥ ≥ M ε ε } | f | d μ μ < ε ε {\displaystyle \forall \ \varepsilon >0,\ \exists \ M_{\varepsilon }>0:\sup _{f\in {\mathcal {F}}}\int _{\{|f|\geq M_{\varepsilon }\}}|f|\,d\mu <\varepsilon } .

A set of functions F ⊂ ⊂ L 1 ( X , A , μ μ ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}\subset L^{1}(X,{\mathcal {A}},\mu )} is said to have uniformly absolutely continuous integrals if lim μ μ ( A ) → → 0 sup f ∈ ∈ F ∫ ∫ A | f | d μ μ = 0 {\displaystyle \lim _{\mu (A)\to 0}\sup _{f\in {\mathcal {F}}}\int _{A}|f|\,d\mu =0} , i.e.

∀ ∀ ε ε > 0 , ∃ ∃ δ δ ε ε > 0 , ∀ ∀ A ∈ ∈ A : μ μ ( A ) < δ δ ε ε ⇒ ⇒ sup f ∈ ∈ F ∫ ∫ A | f | d μ μ < ε ε {\displaystyle \forall \ \varepsilon >0,\ \exists \ \delta _{\varepsilon }>0,\ \forall \ A\in {\mathcal {A}}:\mu (A)<\delta _{\varepsilon }\Rightarrow \sup _{f\in {\mathcal {F}}}\int _{A}|f|\,d\mu <\varepsilon } . This definition is sometimes used as a definition of uniform integrability. However, it differs from the definition of uniform integrability given above.

When μ μ ( X ) < ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \mu (X)<\infty } , a set of functions F ⊂ ⊂ L 1 ( X , A , μ μ ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}\subset L^{1}(X,{\mathcal {A}},\mu )} is uniformly integrable if and only if it is bounded in L 1 ( X , A , μ μ ) {\displaystyle L^{1}(X,{\mathcal {A}},\mu )} and has uniformly absolutely continuous integrals. If, in addition, μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } is atomless, then the uniform integrability is equivalent to the uniform absolute continuity of integrals.

Finite measure case [ edit ] Let ( X , A , μ μ ) {\displaystyle (X,{\mathcal {A}},\mu )} be a measure space with μ μ ( X ) < ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \mu (X)<\infty } . Let ( f n ) ⊂ ⊂ L p ( X , A , μ μ ) {\displaystyle (f_{n})\subset L^{p}(X,{\mathcal {A}},\mu )} and f {\displaystyle f} be an A {\displaystyle {\mathcal {A}}} -measurable function. Then, the following are equivalent : f ∈ ∈ L p ( X , A , μ μ ) {\displaystyle f\in L^{p}(X,{\mathcal {A}},\mu )} and ( f n ) {\displaystyle (f_{n})} converges to f {\displaystyle f} in L p ( X , A , μ μ ) {\displaystyle L^{p}(X,{\mathcal {A}},\mu )} ; The sequence of functions ( f n ) {\displaystyle (f_{n})} converges in μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } -measure to f {\displaystyle f} and ( | f n | p ) n ≥ ≥ 1 {\displaystyle (|f_{n}|^{p})_{n\geq 1}} is uniformly integrable ; For a proof, see Bogachev's monograph "Measure Theory, Volume I".

[ 1 ] Infinite measure case [ edit ] Let ( X , A , μ μ ) {\displaystyle (X,{\mathcal {A}},\mu )} be a measure space and 1 ≤ ≤ p < ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle 1\leq p<\infty } . Let ( f n ) n ≥ ≥ 1 ⊆ ⊆ L p ( X , A , μ μ ) {\displaystyle (f_{n})_{n\geq 1}\subseteq L^{p}(X,{\mathcal {A}},\mu )} and f ∈ ∈ L p ( X , A , μ μ ) {\displaystyle f\in L^{p}(X,{\mathcal {A}},\mu )} . Then, ( f n ) {\displaystyle (f_{n})} converges to f {\displaystyle f} in L p ( X , A , μ μ ) {\displaystyle L^{p}(X,{\mathcal {A}},\mu )} if and only if the following holds : The sequence of functions ( f n ) {\displaystyle (f_{n})} converges in μ μ {\displaystyle \mu } -measure to f {\displaystyle f} ; ( f n ) {\displaystyle (f_{n})} has uniformly absolutely continuous integrals; For every ε ε > 0 {\displaystyle \varepsilon >0} , there exists X ε ε ∈ ∈ A {\displaystyle X_{\varepsilon }\in {\mathcal {A}}} such that μ μ ( X ε ε ) < ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \mu (X_{\varepsilon })<\infty } and sup n ≥ ≥ 1 ∫ ∫ X ∖ ∖ X ε ε | f n | p d μ μ < ε ε .

{\displaystyle \sup _{n\geq 1}\int _{X\setminus X_{\varepsilon }}|f_{n}|^{p}\,d\mu <\varepsilon .} When μ μ ( X ) < ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \mu (X)<\infty } , the third condition becomes superfluous (one can simply take X ε ε = X {\displaystyle X_{\varepsilon }=X} ) and the first two conditions give the usual form of Lebesgue-Vitali's convergence theorem originally stated for measure spaces with finite measure. In this case, one can show that conditions 1 and 2 imply that the sequence ( | f n | p ) n ≥ ≥ 1 {\displaystyle (|f_{n}|^{p})_{n\geq 1}} is uniformly integrable.

Converse of the theorem [ edit ] Let ( X , A , μ μ ) {\displaystyle (X,{\mathcal {A}},\mu )} be measure space. Let ( f n ) n ≥ ≥ 1 ⊆ ⊆ L 1 ( X , A , μ μ ) {\displaystyle (f_{n})_{n\geq 1}\subseteq L^{1}(X,{\mathcal {A}},\mu )} and assume that lim n → → ∞ ∞ ∫ ∫ A f n d μ μ {\displaystyle \lim _{n\to \infty }\int _{A}f_{n}\,d\mu } exists for every A ∈ ∈ A {\displaystyle A\in {\mathcal {A}}} . Then, the sequence ( f n ) {\displaystyle (f_{n})} is bounded in L 1 ( X , A , μ μ ) {\displaystyle L^{1}(X,{\mathcal {A}},\mu )} and has uniformly absolutely continuous integrals. In addition, there exists f ∈ ∈ L 1 ( X , A , μ μ ) {\displaystyle f\in L^{1}(X,{\mathcal {A}},\mu )} such that lim n → → ∞ ∞ ∫ ∫ A f n d μ μ = ∫ ∫ A f d μ μ {\displaystyle \lim _{n\to \infty }\int _{A}f_{n}\,d\mu =\int _{A}f\,d\mu } for every A ∈ ∈ A {\displaystyle A\in {\mathcal {A}}} .

When μ μ ( X ) < ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \mu (X)<\infty } , this implies that ( f n ) {\displaystyle (f_{n})} is uniformly integrable.
