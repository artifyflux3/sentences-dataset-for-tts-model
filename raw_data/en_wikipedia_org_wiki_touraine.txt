Its capital was Tours . During the political reorganization of French territory in 1790, Touraine formed the bulk of the Indre-et-Loire department as well as parts of the new departments of Loir-et-Cher , Indre and Vienne .

Geography [ edit ] Traversed by the river Loire and its tributaries the Cher , the Indre and the Vienne , Touraine makes up a part of the western Paris Basin . It is well known for its viticulture . The TGV high-speed train system, which connects Tours with Paris (200 kilometers away) in just over an hour, has made Touraine a place of residence for people who work in the French capital but seek a different quality of life.

History [ edit ] Touraine takes its name from a Celtic tribe called the Turones , who inhabited the region about two thousand years ago.  
In 1044, the control of Touraine was given to the Angevins , who (as the House of Plantagenet ) became kings of England in 1154, the castle of Chinon being their greatest stronghold. In 1205, Philip II Augustus of France regained Touraine. At this time, Touraine was made into a royal duchy . In 1429, Saint Joan of Arc had a historic meeting with the future King of France Charles VII at Chinon . Throughout the late 15th and 16th centuries, Touraine was a favorite residence of French kings, and the dark and gloomy castles were converted to Renaissance châteaux; for this reason the region was titled "The Garden of France". These same châteaux became popular tourist attractions in modern times. The royal duchy became a province in 1584, and was divided into departments in 1790.
