He began to make astronomic instruments mainly for his own use. His third son Adolf Repsold continued the well-known astronomical instrument firm as the A. & G. Repsold company,  which later became A. Repsold und Söhne (Repsold & sons).

Repsold was born in Wremen (today near Bremerhaven ) to the clergyman Johann Repsold and his wife Charlotte Friederike Böhmer. Repsold initially studied for a career in theology but moved to study mathematics and drawing under Reinhard Woltmann, an Elbe River pilot who later worked for the Hamburg waterworks. In 1795 Repsold became a river pilot and in 1799 he married Eleonore Scharff, daughter of a captain in the fire brigade and in the same year, he joined the fire brigade of Hamburg , too. He met the Swiss astronomer Johann Caspar Horner , who was making measurements in the Elbe river and discovered a common interest in astronomic instrument design and in 1800 he established a workshop. He began to make optical instruments as well and began a correspondence with Carl Friedrich Gauss on achromatic doublets. In 1802 he began to build a private observatory, and collaborated in astronomical observations with Heinrich Christian Schumacher . In 1803 he made a transit instrument for Horner and in 1815 Repsold made a meridian circle for Gauss at the Göttingen observatory . Gauss gave Repsold the plan for a heliotrope , which was made in 1821. The Hamburg observatory was destroyed in the Napoleonic Wars in 1811. In 1825 a new observatory was completed at the town wall , [ 1 ] and Repsold became the director, supplying instruments at his own expense with other funding from the city of Hamburg.

[ 2 ] Repsold died in 1830 when he was struck by a falling beam while supervising firefighting at a major fire. The expense of running the observatory was subsequently taken over by the local government, and the new director was Carl Ludwig Christian Rümker .  Repsold's observatory was demolished upon the completion of a new observatory, the modern Hamburg Observatory at Bergedorf , between 1906 and 1912. The site is now occupied by the Hamburg Museum . A bronze bust was set up in his honour beside the Hamburg state astronomical observatory.

His third son Adolf Repsold took over position in the Hamburg fire-brigade and having apprenticed with his father, he and his brother Georg began the instrument-making business of A. and G. Repsold. In 1831, they made an instrument for Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel . The family instrument business was continued by Adolf's son Johann Adolf Repsold (1838-1919).

[ 3 ] [ 2 ] The crater Repsold on the Moon is named after him, as is the asteroid 906 Repsolda .
