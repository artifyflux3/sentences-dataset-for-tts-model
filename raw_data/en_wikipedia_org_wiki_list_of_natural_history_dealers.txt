Bottcher Natural history specimen dealers had an important role in the development of science in the 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries. They supplied the rapidly growing, both in size and number, museums and educational establishments and private collectors whose collections, either in entirety or parts finally entered museums .
Most sold not just zoological , botanical and geological specimens but also 
equipment and books. Many also sold archaeological and ethnographic items. They purchased 
specimens from professional and amateur collectors, sometimes collected themselves as well as acting as agents for the sale of 
collections. Many were based in mercantile centres notably Amsterdam , Hamburg , and London or 
in major cities. Some were specialists and some were taxonomic authorities who wrote scientific works and manuals, some functioned as trading museums or institutes.
