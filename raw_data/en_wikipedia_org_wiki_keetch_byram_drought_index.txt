It is commonly used for the purpose of predicting the likelihood and severity of wildfires . It is calculated based on rainfall, air temperature, and other meteorological factors.

[ 1 ] The KBDI is an estimate of the soil moisture deficit, which is the amount of water necessary to bring the soil moisture to its full capacity. A high soil moisture deficit means there is little water available for evaporation or plant transpiration .

[ 2 ] This occurs in conditions of extended drought , and has significant effects on fire behaviour.

In the United States, it is expressed as a range from 0 to 800, referring to hundredths of an inch of deficit in water availability; in countries that use the metric system , it is expressed from 0 to 200, referring to millimetres.

[ 3 ] Index value (hundredths of inches) Index value (millimetres) Implications [ 3 ] [ 4 ] 0–200 0–50 Soil is moist. 0 represents a completely saturated soil.

[ 5 ] 200–400 50–100 Leaf litter begins to dry.

400–600 100–150 Lower litter actively contributes to fire intensity and will burn actively.

600–800 150–200 Associated with severe drought and extreme fire behaviour.
