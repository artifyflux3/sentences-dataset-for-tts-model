A map of the New York City Subway, an example of a topological map.

An office environment consisting of two rooms connected by a hallway. A topological map is super-imposed.

In cartography , geology , and robotics , [ 1 ] a topological map is a type of diagram that has been simplified so that only vital information remains and unnecessary detail has been removed . These maps lack scale, also distance and direction are subject to change and/or variation, but the topological relationship between points is maintained.  A good example are the transit maps for the London Underground and the New York City Subway .
