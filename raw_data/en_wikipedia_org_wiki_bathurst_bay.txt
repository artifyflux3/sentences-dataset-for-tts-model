[ 1 ] In the 19th century it was the base for the pearling fleet. It is now a tourist attraction for Cape York Peninsula in northern Queensland , Australia, near the Great Barrier Reef .

History [ edit ] The area was home to the Mutumui and Walmbaria tribes. The British first settled Bathurst Bay sometime in the early-19th Century. The settlement had few tradable goods because of its climate and terrain. The site became important in the mid- to late-19th Century as an anchorage for the pearling fleet, which was discovering valuable oyster pearls . By the 1890s, the pearling fleet was the only reason for continued settlement. The settlement was destroyed on 4 March 1899, when Cyclone Mahina passed through northern Queensland. Cyclone Mahina was notable for producing the highest recorded storm surge of any tropical cyclone in history. The once-abundant forests have not regrown, mainly because of continuing salt damage to the land by the storm surge . Since the Federation of Australia in 1901, Bathurst Bay has become a popular fishing area. Few people have settled the bay area.
