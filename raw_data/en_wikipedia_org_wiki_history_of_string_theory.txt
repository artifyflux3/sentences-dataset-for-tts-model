The **history of string theory** spans several decades of intense research including two superstring revolutions. Through the combined efforts of many researchers, [string theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory "String theory") has developed into a broad and varied subject with connections to [quantum gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_gravity "Quantum gravity"), [particle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics "Particle physics") and [condensed matter physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condensed_matter_physics "Condensed matter physics"), [cosmology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology "Cosmology"), and [pure mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_mathematics "Pure mathematics").

1943–1959: S-matrix theory
--------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_string_theory&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: 1943–1959: S-matrix theory")]

String theory represents an outgrowth of [S-matrix theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-matrix_theory "S-matrix theory"),[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_string_theory#cite_note-1) a research program begun by [Werner Heisenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werner_Heisenberg "Werner Heisenberg") in 1943[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_string_theory#cite_note-2) following [John Archibald Wheeler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Archibald_Wheeler "John Archibald Wheeler")'s 1937 introduction of the S-matrix.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_string_theory#cite_note-3) Many prominent theorists picked up and advocated S-matrix theory, starting in the late 1950s and throughout the 1960s. The field became marginalized and discarded in the mid-1970s[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_string_theory#cite_note-4) and disappeared in the 1980s. Physicists neglected it because some of its mathematical methods were alien, and because [quantum chromodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_chromodynamics "Quantum chromodynamics") supplanted it as an experimentally better-qualified approach to the [strong interactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_interactions "Strong interactions").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_string_theory#cite_note-5)

The theory presented a radical rethinking of the foundations of physical laws. By the 1940s it had become clear that the [proton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton "Proton") and the [neutron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron "Neutron") were not pointlike particles like the electron. Their [magnetic moment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_moment "Magnetic moment") differed greatly from that of a pointlike [spin-½](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-%C2%BD "Spin-½") charged particle, too much to attribute the difference to a small [perturbation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perturbation_theory "Perturbation theory"). Their interactions were so strong that they scattered like a small sphere, not like a point. Heisenberg proposed that the strongly interacting particles were in fact extended objects, and because there are difficulties of principle with extended relativistic particles, he proposed that the notion of a space-time point broke down at nuclear scales.

Without space and time, it becomes difficult to formulate a physical theory. Heisenberg proposed a solution to this problem: focusing on the observable quantities—those things measurable by experiments. An experiment only sees a microscopic quantity if it can be transferred by a series of events to the classical devices that surround the experimental chamber. The objects that fly to infinity are stable particles, in quantum superpositions of different momentum states.

Heisenberg proposed that even when space and time are unreliable, the notion of momentum state, which is defined far away from the experimental chamber, still works. The physical quantity he proposed as fundamental is the [quantum mechanical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanical "Quantum mechanical")[amplitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_amplitude "Probability amplitude") for a group of incoming particles to turn into a group of outgoing particles, and he did not admit that there were any steps in between.

The [S-matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-matrix "S-matrix") is the quantity that describes how a collection of incoming particles turn into outgoing ones. Heisenberg proposed to study the S-matrix directly, without any assumptions about space-time structure. But when transitions from the far-past to the far-future occur in one step with no intermediate steps, it becomes difficult to calculate anything. In [quantum field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory "Quantum field theory"), the intermediate steps are the fluctuations of fields or equivalently the fluctuations of virtual particles. In this proposed S-matrix theory, there are no local quantities at all.

Heisenberg proposed to use [unitarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitarity_(physics) "Unitarity (physics)") to determine the S-matrix. In all conceivable situations, the sum of the squares of the amplitudes must equal 1. This property can determine the amplitude in a quantum field theory order by order in a [perturbation series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perturbation_series "Perturbation series") once the basic interactions are given, and in many quantum field theories the amplitudes grow too fast at high energies to make a unitary S-matrix. But without extra assumptions on the high-energy behavior, unitarity is not enough to determine the scattering, and the proposal was ignored for many years.

Heisenberg's proposal was revived in 1956 when [Murray Gell-Mann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Gell-Mann "Murray Gell-Mann") recognized that [dispersion relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispersion_relations "Dispersion relations")—like those discovered by [Hendrik Kramers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hendrik_Kramers "Hendrik Kramers") and [Ralph Kronig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Kronig "Ralph Kronig") in the 1920s (see [Kramers–Kronig relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kramers%E2%80%93Kronig_relations "Kramers–Kronig relations"))—allow the formulation of a notion of causality, a notion that events in the future would not influence events in the past, even when the microscopic notion of past and future are not clearly defined. He also recognized that these relations might be useful in computing observables for the case of strong interaction physics.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_string_theory#cite_note-6) The dispersion relations were [analytic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_continuation "Analytic continuation") properties of the S-matrix,[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_string_theory#cite_note-Rickles29-7) and they imposed more stringent conditions than those that follow from unitarity alone. This development in S-matrix theory stemmed from Murray Gell-Mann and [Marvin Leonard Goldberger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Leonard_Goldberger "Marvin Leonard Goldberger")'s (1954) discovery of [crossing symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossing_(physics) "Crossing (physics)"), another condition that the S-matrix had to fulfil.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_string_theory#cite_note-8)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_string_theory#cite_note-Rickles29-7)

Prominent advocates of the new "dispersion relations" approach included [Stanley Mandelstam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Mandelstam "Stanley Mandelstam")[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_string_theory#cite_note-Mandelstam58-9) and [Geoffrey Chew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Chew "Geoffrey Chew"),[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_string_theory#cite_note-10) both at [UC Berkeley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UC_Berkeley "UC Berkeley") at the time. Mandelstam discovered the [double dispersion relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Double_dispersion_relation&action=edit&redlink=1 "Double dispersion relation (page does not exist)"), a new and powerful analytic form, in 1958,[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_string_theory#cite_note-Mandelstam58-9) and believed that it would provide the key to progress in the intractable strong interactions.

1959–1968: Regge theory and bootstrap models
--------------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_string_theory&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: 1959–1968: Regge theory and bootstrap models")]

By the late 1950s, many strongly interacting particles of ever higher spins had been discovered, and it became clear that they were not all fundamental. While Japanese physicist [Shoichi Sakata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoichi_Sakata "Shoichi Sakata") proposed that the particles could be understood as [bound states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bound_state "Bound state") of just three of them (the proton, the neutron and the [Lambda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_baryon "Lambda baryon"); see [Sakata model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sakata_model "Sakata model")),[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_string_theory#cite_note-11) Geoffrey Chew believed that none of these particles are fundamental[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_string_theory#cite_note-12)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_string_theory#cite_note-13) (for details, see [Bootstrap model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrap_model "Bootstrap model")). Sakata's approach was reworked in the 1960s into the [quark model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark_model "Quark model") by [Murray Gell-Mann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Gell-Mann "Murray Gell-Mann") and [George Zweig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Zweig "George Zweig") by making the [charges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge "Electric charge") of the hypothetical constituents [fractional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction_(mathematics) "Fraction (mathematics)") and rejecting the idea that they were observed particles. At the time, Chew's approach was considered more mainstream because it did not introduce fractional charge values and because it focused on experimentally measurable S-matrix elements, not on hypothetical pointlike constituents.

In 1959, [Tullio Regge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tullio_Regge "Tullio Regge"), a young theorist in Italy, discovered that bound states in quantum mechanics can be organized into families known as [Regge trajectories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regge_trajectories "Regge trajectories"), each family having distinctive [angular momenta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_momentum "Angular momentum").[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_string_theory#cite_note-14) This idea was generalized to [relativistic quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativistic_quantum_mechanics "Relativistic quantum mechanics") by [Stanley Mandelstam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Mandelstam "Stanley Mandelstam"), [Vladimir Gribov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Gribov "Vladimir Gribov") and [Marcel Froissart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Froissart "Marcel Froissart"), using a mathematical method (the [Sommerfeld–Watson representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sommerfeld%E2%80%93Watson_representation&action=edit&redlink=1 "Sommerfeld–Watson representation (page does not exist)")) discovered decades earlier by [Arnold Sommerfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Sommerfeld "Arnold Sommerfeld") and [Kenneth M. Watson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_M._Watson "Kenneth M. Watson"): the result was dubbed the [Froissart–Gribov formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Froissart%E2%80%93Gribov_formula&action=edit&redlink=1 "Froissart–Gribov formula (page does not exist)").[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_string_theory#cite_note-S-Matrix_Past_and_Future-15)

In 1961, Geoffrey Chew and [Steven Frautschi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Frautschi "Steven Frautschi") recognized that [mesons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meson "Meson") had straight line Regge trajectories[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_string_theory#cite_note-16) (in their scheme, spin is plotted against mass squared on a so-called [Chew–Frautschi plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chew%E2%80%93Frautschi_plot&action=edit&redlink=1 "Chew–Frautschi plot (page does not exist)")), which implied that the scattering of these particles would have very strange behavior—it should fall off exponentially quickly at large angles. With this realization, theorists hoped to construct a theory of [composite particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_particles "Composite particles") on Regge trajectories, whose scattering amplitudes had the [asymptotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptotic "Asymptotic") form demanded by Regge theory.

In 1967, a notable step forward in the bootstrap approach was the principle of [DHS duality](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=DHS_duality&action=edit&redlink=1 "DHS duality (page does not exist)") introduced by [Richard Dolen](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Richard_Dolen&action=edit&redlink=1 "Richard Dolen (page does not exist)"), [David Horn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Horn_(Israeli_physicist) "David Horn (Israeli physicist)"), and [Christoph Schmid](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Christoph_Schmid_(physicist)&action=edit&redlink=1 "Christoph Schmid (physicist) (page does not exist)") in 1967,[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_string_theory#cite_note-17) at [Caltech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caltech "Caltech") (the original term for it was "average duality" or "finite energy sum rule (FESR) duality"). The three researchers noticed that [Regge pole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regge_pole "Regge pole") exchange (at high energy) and resonance (at low energy) descriptions offer multiple representations/approximations of one and the same physically observable process.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_string_theory#cite_note-18)

1968–1974: Dual resonance model
-------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_string_theory&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: 1968–1974: Dual resonance model")]

The first model in which hadronic particles essentially follow the Regge trajectories was the [dual resonance model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_resonance_model "Dual resonance model") that was constructed by [Gabriele Veneziano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriele_Veneziano "Gabriele Veneziano") in 1968,[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_string_theory#cite_note-19) who noted that the [Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler "Leonhard Euler")[beta function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_function "Beta function") could be used to describe 4-particle scattering amplitude data for such particles. The [Veneziano scattering amplitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veneziano_scattering_amplitude "Veneziano scattering amplitude") (or Veneziano model) was quickly generalized to an _N_-particle amplitude by [Ziro Koba](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ziro_Koba&action=edit&redlink=1 "Ziro Koba (page does not exist)") and [Holger Bech Nielsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holger_Bech_Nielsen "Holger Bech Nielsen")[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_string_theory#cite_note-20) (their approach was dubbed the [Koba–Nielsen formalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Koba%E2%80%93Nielsen_formalism&action=edit&redlink=1 "Koba–Nielsen formalism (page does not exist)")), and to what are now recognized as closed strings by [Miguel Virasoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miguel_%C3%81ngel_Virasoro_(physicist) "Miguel Ángel Virasoro (physicist)")[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_string_theory#cite_note-21) and [Joel A. Shapiro](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joel_A._Shapiro&action=edit&redlink=1 "Joel A. Shapiro (page does not exist)")[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_string_theory#cite_note-22) (their approach was dubbed the [Shapiro–Virasoro model](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shapiro%E2%80%93Virasoro_model&action=edit&redlink=1 "Shapiro–Virasoro model (page does not exist)")).

In 1969, the [Chan–Paton rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chan%E2%80%93Paton_rules "Chan–Paton rules") (proposed by [Jack E. Paton](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jack_Paton_(physicist)&action=edit&redlink=1 "Jack Paton (physicist) (page does not exist)") and [Hong-Mo Chan](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hong-Mo_Chan&action=edit&redlink=1 "Hong-Mo Chan (page does not exist)"))[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_string_theory#cite_note-23) enabled [isospin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isospin "Isospin") factors to be added to the Veneziano model.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_string_theory#cite_note-24)

In 1969–70, [Yoichiro Nambu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoichiro_Nambu "Yoichiro Nambu"),[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_string_theory#cite_note-25)[Holger Bech Nielsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holger_Bech_Nielsen "Holger Bech Nielsen"),[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_string_theory#cite_note-26) and [Leonard Susskind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Susskind "Leonard Susskind")[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_string_theory#cite_note-27)[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_string_theory#cite_note-28) presented a physical interpretation of the Veneziano amplitude by representing nuclear forces as vibrating, one-dimensional strings. However, this string-based description of the strong force made many predictions that directly contradicted experimental findings.

In 1971, [Pierre Ramond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Ramond "Pierre Ramond")[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_string_theory#cite_note-29) and, independently, [John H. Schwarz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_H._Schwarz "John H. Schwarz") and [André Neveu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_Neveu "André Neveu")[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_string_theory#cite_note-30) attempted to implement fermions into the dual model. This led to the concept of "spinning strings", and pointed the way to a method for removing the problematic [tachyon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tachyon "Tachyon") (see [RNS formalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNS_formalism "RNS formalism")).[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_string_theory#cite_note-31)

Dual resonance models for strong interactions were a relatively popular subject of study between 1968 and 1973.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_string_theory#cite_note-32) The scientific community lost interest in string theory as a theory of strong interactions in 1973 when [quantum chromodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_chromodynamics "Quantum chromodynamics") became the main focus of theoretical research[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_string_theory#cite_note-33) (mainly due to the theoretical appeal of its [asymptotic freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptotic_freedom "Asymptotic freedom")).[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_string_theory#cite_note-34)

1974–1984: Bosonic string theory and superstring theory
-------------------------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_string_theory&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: 1974–1984: Bosonic string theory and superstring theory")]

In 1974, John H. Schwarz and [Joël Scherk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jo%C3%ABl_Scherk "Joël Scherk"),[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_string_theory#cite_note-35) and independently [Tamiaki Yoneya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamiaki_Yoneya "Tamiaki Yoneya"),[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_string_theory#cite_note-36) studied the [boson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boson "Boson")-like patterns of [string vibration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_vibration "String vibration") and found that their properties exactly matched those of the [graviton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graviton "Graviton"), the gravitational force's hypothetical [messenger particle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_particle "Messenger particle"). Schwarz and Scherk argued that string theory had failed to catch on because physicists had underestimated its scope. This led to the development of [bosonic string theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosonic_string_theory "Bosonic string theory").

String theory is formulated in terms of the [Polyakov action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyakov_action "Polyakov action"),[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_string_theory#cite_note-37) which describes how strings move through space and time. Like springs, the strings tend to contract to minimize their potential energy, but conservation of energy prevents them from disappearing, and instead they oscillate. By applying the ideas of [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics") to strings it is possible to deduce the different vibrational modes of strings, and that each vibrational state appears to be a different particle. The mass of each particle, and the fashion with which it can interact, are determined by the way the string vibrates—in essence, by the "[note](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_note "Musical note")" the string "sounds." The scale of notes, each corresponding to a different kind of particle, is termed the "[spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_spectrum "Energy spectrum")" of the theory.

Early models included both _open_ strings, which have two distinct endpoints, and _closed_ strings, where the endpoints are joined to make a complete loop. The two types of string behave in slightly different ways, yielding two spectra. Not all modern string theories use both types; some incorporate only the closed variety.

The earliest string model has several problems: it has a [critical dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_dimension "Critical dimension")_D_ = 26, a feature that was originally discovered by [Claud Lovelace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claud_Lovelace "Claud Lovelace") in 1971;[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_string_theory#cite_note-38) the theory has a fundamental instability, the presence of tachyons[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_string_theory#cite_note-39) (see [tachyon condensation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tachyon_condensation "Tachyon condensation")); additionally, the spectrum of particles contains only [bosons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosons "Bosons"), particles like the [photon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon "Photon") that obey particular rules of behavior. While bosons are a critical ingredient of the Universe, they are not its only constituents. Investigating how a string theory may include [fermions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermion "Fermion") in its spectrum led to the invention of [supersymmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersymmetry "Supersymmetry") (in [the West](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world "Western world"))[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_string_theory#cite_note-40) in 1971,[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_string_theory#cite_note-41) a mathematical transformation between bosons and fermions. String theories that include fermionic vibrations are now known as [superstring theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superstring_theory "Superstring theory").

In 1977, the [GSO projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSO_projection "GSO projection") (named after [Ferdinando Gliozzi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinando_Gliozzi "Ferdinando Gliozzi"), Joël Scherk, and [David I. Olive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_I._Olive "David I. Olive")) led to a family of tachyon-free unitary free string theories,[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_string_theory#cite_note-42) the first consistent superstring theories (see [below](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_string_theory#1984%E2%80%931994:_first_superstring_revolution)).

1984–1994: First superstring revolution
---------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_string_theory&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: 1984–1994: First superstring revolution")]

The **first superstring revolution** is a period of important discoveries that began in 1984.[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_string_theory#cite_note-43) It was realized that string theory was capable of describing all [elementary particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_particle "Elementary particle") as well as the [interactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_interactions "Fundamental interactions") between them. Hundreds of physicists started to work on [string theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory "String theory") as the most promising idea to unify physical theories.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_string_theory#cite_note-44) The revolution was started by a discovery of [anomaly cancellation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomaly_(physics) "Anomaly (physics)") in [type I string theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_string_theory "Type I string theory") via the [Green–Schwarz mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green%E2%80%93Schwarz_mechanism "Green–Schwarz mechanism") (named after [Michael Green](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Green_(physicist) "Michael Green (physicist)") and John H. Schwarz) in 1984.[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_string_theory#cite_note-45)[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_string_theory#cite_note-46) The ground-breaking discovery of the [heterotic string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterotic_string_theory "Heterotic string theory") was made by [David Gross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Gross "David Gross"), [Jeffrey Harvey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_A._Harvey "Jeffrey A.

1994–2003: Second superstring revolution
----------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_string_theory&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: 1994–2003: Second superstring revolution")]

In the early 1990s, Edward Witten and others found strong evidence that the different superstring theories were different limits of an 11-dimensional theory[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_string_theory#cite_note-54)[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_string_theory#cite_note-55) that became known as [M-theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-theory "M-theory") (for details, see [Introduction to M-theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_M-theory "Introduction to M-theory")).[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_string_theory#cite_note-56) These discoveries sparked the **second superstring revolution** that took place approximately between 1994 and 1995.[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_string_theory#cite_note-57)

The different versions of [superstring theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superstring_theory "Superstring theory") were unified, as long hoped, by new equivalences. These are known as [S-duality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-duality "S-duality"), [T-duality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-duality "T-duality"), [U-duality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U-duality "U-duality"), [mirror symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_symmetry_(string_theory) "Mirror symmetry (string theory)"), and [conifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conifold "Conifold") transitions. The different theories of strings were also related to M-theory.

In 1995, [Joseph Polchinski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Polchinski "Joseph Polchinski") discovered that the theory requires the inclusion of higher-dimensional objects, called [D-branes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-brane "D-brane"):[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_string_theory#cite_note-58) these are the sources of electric and magnetic [Ramond–Ramond fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramond%E2%80%93Ramond_field "Ramond–Ramond field") that are required by [string duality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_duality "String duality").[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_string_theory#cite_note-59) D-branes added additional rich mathematical structure to the theory, and opened possibilities for constructing realistic cosmological models in the theory (for details, see [Brane cosmology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brane_cosmology "Brane cosmology")).

In 1997–98, [Juan Maldacena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Maldacena "Juan Maldacena") conjectured a relationship between [type IIB string theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_IIB_string_theory "Type IIB string theory") and [_N_ = 4 supersymmetric Yang–Mills theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N_%3D_4_supersymmetric_Yang%E2%80%93Mills_theory "N = 4 supersymmetric Yang–Mills theory"), a [gauge theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_theory "Gauge theory").[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_string_theory#cite_note-60) This conjecture, called the [AdS/CFT correspondence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AdS/CFT_correspondence "AdS/CFT correspondence"), has generated a great deal of interest in [high energy physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_energy_physics "High energy physics").[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_string_theory#cite_note-61) It is a realization of the [holographic principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holographic_principle "Holographic principle"), which has far-reaching implications: the AdS/CFT correspondence has helped elucidate the mysteries of [black holes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_holes "Black holes") suggested by [Stephen Hawking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hawking "Stephen Hawking")'s work[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_string_theory#cite_note-62) and is believed to provide a resolution of the [black hole information paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole_information_paradox "Black hole information paradox").[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_string_theory#cite_note-63)

The reason given is: any noteworthy developments over the last 20 years?. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information._(August 2023)_

In 2003, [Michael R. Douglas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_R._Douglas "Michael R. Douglas")'s discovery of the [string theory landscape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory_landscape "String theory landscape"),[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_string_theory#cite_note-64) which suggests that string theory has a large number of inequivalent [false vacua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_vacuum "False vacuum"),[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_string_theory#cite_note-65) led to much discussion of what string theory might eventually be expected to predict, and how [cosmology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology "Cosmology") can be incorporated into the theory.[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_string_theory#cite_note-66)

A possible mechanism of string theory vacuum stabilization (the [KKLT mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KKLT_mechanism "KKLT mechanism")) was proposed in 2003 by [Shamit Kachru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamit_Kachru "Shamit Kachru"), [Renata Kallosh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renata_Kallosh "Renata Kallosh"), [Andrei Linde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrei_Linde "Andrei Linde"), and [Sandip Trivedi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandip_Trivedi "Sandip Trivedi").[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_string_theory#cite_note-67) Much of the present-day research is focused on characterizing the "[swampland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swampland_(physics) "Swampland (physics)")" of theories incompatible with [quantum gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_gravity "Quantum gravity"). The [Ryu–Takayanagi conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryu%E2%80%93Takayanagi_conjecture "Ryu–Takayanagi conjecture") introduced many concepts from quantum information into string theory.

56.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_string_theory#cite_ref-56 "Jump up")**When Witten named it M-theory, he did not specify what the "M" stood for, presumably because he did not feel he had the right to name a theory he had not been able to fully describe. The "M" sometimes is said to stand for Mystery, or Magic, or Mother. More serious suggestions include Matrix or Membrane. [Sheldon Glashow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheldon_Glashow "Sheldon Glashow") has noted that the "M" might be an upside down "W", standing for Witten. Others have suggested that the "M" in M-theory should stand for Missing, Monstrous or even Murky. According to Witten himself, as quoted in the [PBS documentary](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/series/the-elegant-universe/) based on [Brian Greene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Greene "Brian Greene")'s _[The Elegant Universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Elegant\_Universe "The Elegant Universe")_, the "M" in M-theory stands for "magic, mystery, or matrix according to taste."
