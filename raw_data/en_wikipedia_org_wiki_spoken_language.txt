Oral or vocal languages are those produced using the vocal tract, whereas sign languages are produced with the body and hands.

Definition [ edit ] The term "spoken language" is sometimes used to mean only oral languages, especially by linguists, excluding sign languages and making the terms 'spoken', 'oral', 'vocal language' synonymous. Others refer to sign language as "spoken", especially in contrast to written transcriptions of signs.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Relation between spoken and written language [ edit ] The relationship between spoken language and written language is complex. Within the fields of linguistics , the current consensus is that speech is an innate human capability, and written language is a cultural invention.

[ 4 ] However, some linguists, such as those of the Prague school , argue that written and spoken language possess distinct qualities which would argue against written language being dependent on spoken language for its existence.

[ 5 ] Acquiring spoken language [ edit ] Hearing children acquire as their first language the language that is used around them, whether vocal, cued (if they are sighted), or signed. Deaf children can do the same with Cued Speech or sign language if either visual communication system is used around them. Vocal language are traditionally taught to them in the same way that written language must be taught to hearing children. (See oralism .) [ 6 ] [ 7 ] Teachers give particular emphasis on spoken language with children who speak a different primary language outside of the school. For the child it is considered important, socially and educationally, to have the opportunity to understand multiple languages.
