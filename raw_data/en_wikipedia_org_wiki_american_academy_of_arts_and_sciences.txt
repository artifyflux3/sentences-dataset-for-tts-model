The American Academy of Arts and Sciences Abbreviation The American Academy; The Academy Formation May 4, 1780 ; 245 years ago ( 1780-05-04 ) Type Honorary society and independent research center Headquarters Cambridge, Massachusetts , U.S.

Membership 5,700+ active members President Laurie L. Patton [ 1 ] Subsidiaries Daedalus Website www .amacad .org The House of the Academy, Cambridge, Massachusetts The American Academy of Arts and Sciences ( The Academy ) is one of the oldest learned societies in the United States . It was founded in 1780 during the American Revolution by John Adams , John Hancock , James Bowdoin , [ 2 ] Andrew Oliver , and other Founding Fathers of the United States .

[ 3 ] It is headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts .

Membership in the academy is achieved through a nominating petition, review, and election process.

[ 4 ] The academy's quarterly journal, Dædalus , is published by the MIT Press on behalf of the academy, [ 5 ] and has been open-access since January 2021.

[ 6 ] The academy also conducts multidisciplinary public policy research.

[ 7 ] Laurie L. Patton has served as President of the Academy since January 2025.

[ 8 ] History [ edit ] The Academy was established by the Massachusetts legislature on May 4, 1780, charted in order "to cultivate every art and science which may tend to advance the interest, honor, dignity, and happiness of a free, independent, and virtuous people." [ 9 ] The sixty-two incorporating fellows represented varying interests and high standing in the political, professional, and commercial sectors of the state. The first class of new members, chosen by the Academy in 1781, included Benjamin Franklin and George Washington as well as several international honorary members. The initial volume of Academy Memoirs appeared in 1785, and the Proceedings followed in 1846. In the 1950s, the Academy launched its journal Daedalus , reflecting its commitment to a broader intellectual and socially-oriented program.

[ 10 ] Since the second half of the twentieth century, independent research has become a central focus of  the Academy. In the late 1950s, arms control emerged as one of its signature concerns. The Academy also served as the catalyst in establishing the National Humanities Center in North Carolina . In the late 1990s, the Academy developed a new strategic plan, focusing on four major areas: science, technology, and global security; social policy and education; humanities and culture; and education. In 2002, the Academy established a visiting scholars program in association with Harvard University . More than 75 academic institutions from across the country have become Affiliates of the Academy to support this program and other Academy initiatives.

[ 11 ] The Academy has sponsored a number of awards and prizes, [ 12 ] throughout its history and has offered opportunities for fellowships and visiting scholars at the Academy.

[ 13 ] In July 2013, the Boston Globe exposed then president Leslie Berlowitz for falsifying her credentials, faking a doctorate, and consistently mistreating her staff.

[ 14 ] Berlowitz subsequently resigned.

[ 15 ] [ 16 ] Projects [ edit ] The Humanities Indicators [ edit ] Main article: Humanities Indicators A project of the Academy that equips researchers, policymakers, universities, foundations, museums, libraries, humanities councils, and other public institutions with statistical tools for answering basic questions about primary and secondary humanities education, undergraduate and graduate education in the humanities , the humanities workforce, levels and sources of program funding, public understanding and impact of the humanities, and other areas of concern in the humanities community.

[ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] It is modeled on the Science and Engineering Indicators, published biennially by the National Science Board as required by Congress .
