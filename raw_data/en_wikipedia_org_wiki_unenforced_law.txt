( June 2025 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) An unenforced law (also symbolic law , [ 1 ] dead letter law ) [ 2 ] is a law which is formally in effect ( de jure ), but is usually ( de facto ) not penalized by a jurisdiction .

[ 3 ] Such laws are usually ignored by law enforcement , and therefore there are few or no practical consequences for breaking them.

[ 4 ] The existence of unenforced laws has been criticized for undermining the legal system in general, as such laws may be selectively enforced .

[ 5 ] Overview [ edit ] Unenforced laws may be enacted purely for symbolic reasons, with little or no intention of enforcement.

[ 6 ] There are also circumstances in which an otherwise enforced law is not; for example, speeding in a motor vehicle is illegal in most jurisdictions, however law enforcement may choose to ignore motorists who only slightly exceed the legal speed limit.

[ 7 ] Automated traffic enforcement cameras may still issue fines in these circumstances in some jurisdictions.

[ 8 ] Symbolic laws typically attempt to persuade rather than enforce, punish or prevent.

[ 9 ] [ 5 ] For example, until the relevant statute was repealed in 2013, adultery was prohibited by law in the US state of Colorado , but no criminal penalty was specified.

[ 10 ] In Maryland , adultery is prohibited, however the statutory criminal penalty is limited to a $10 fine.

[ 11 ] In the United Kingdom , under the Treason Felony Act 1848 , it is a crime punishable by life imprisonment to advocate for the creation of a republic in print, even peacefully.

[ 12 ] The Law Lords ' interpretation of the later Human Rights Act 1998 , however, has ensured that this law is unenforced, on the grounds that peaceful advocacy of a republic is protected speech .
