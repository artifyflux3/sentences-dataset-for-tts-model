( May 2024 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) A spherical segment Pair of parallel planes intersecting a sphere forming a spherical segment (i.e., a spherical frustum) Terminology for spherical segments.

In geometry , a spherical segment is the solid defined by cutting a sphere or a ball with a pair of parallel planes .
It can be thought of as a spherical cap with the top truncated, and so it corresponds to a spherical frustum .

The surface of the spherical segment (excluding the bases) is called spherical zone .

Geometric parameters for spherical segment.

If the radius of the sphere is called R , the radii of the spherical segment bases are a and b , and the height of the segment (the distance from one parallel plane to the other) called h , then the volume of the spherical segment is V = π π 6 h ( 3 a 2 + 3 b 2 + h 2 ) .

{\displaystyle V={\frac {\pi }{6}}h\left(3a^{2}+3b^{2}+h^{2}\right).} For the special case of the top plane being tangent to the sphere, we have b = 0 {\displaystyle b=0} and the solid reduces to a spherical cap .

[ 1 ] The equation above for volume of the spherical segment can be arranged to V = [ π π a 2 ( h 2 ) ] + [ π π b 2 ( h 2 ) ] + [ 4 3 π π ( h 2 ) 3 ] {\displaystyle V={\biggl [}\pi a^{2}\left({\frac {h}{2}}{\biggr )}\right]+{\biggl [}\pi b^{2}\left({\frac {h}{2}}{\biggr )}\right]+{\biggl [}{\frac {4}{3}}\pi \left({\frac {h}{2}}\right)^{3}{\biggr ]}} Thus, the segment volume equals the sum of three volumes: two right circular cylinders  one of radius a and the second of radius b (both of height h / 2 {\displaystyle h/2} ) and a sphere of radius h / 2 {\displaystyle h/2} .

The curved surface area of the spherical zone—which excludes the top and bottom bases—is given by A = 2 π π R h .

{\displaystyle A=2\pi Rh.} Thus the surface area of the segment depends only on the distance between the cutting planes, and not their absolute heights.
