Alternation of the n -cube yields one of two n -demicubes , as in this 3-dimensional illustration of the two tetrahedra that arise as the 3-demicubes of the 3-cube .

In geometry , demihypercubes (also called n-demicubes , n-hemicubes , and half measure polytopes ) are a class of n - polytopes constructed from alternation of an n - hypercube , labeled as hγ n for being half of the hypercube family, γ n . Half of the vertices are deleted and new facets are formed. The 2 n facets become 2 n ( n −1)-demicubes , and 2 n ( n −1)-simplex facets are formed in place of the deleted vertices.

[ 1 ] They have been named with a demi- prefix to each hypercube name: demi cube , demi tesseract , etc. The demicube is identical to the regular tetrahedron , and the demitesseract is identical to the regular 16-cell . The demipenteract is considered semiregular for having only regular facets. Higher forms do not have all regular facets but are all uniform polytopes .

The vertex-edge graph of the demihypercube is the halved cube graph .

An n -demicube has inversion symmetry if n is even .

Discovery [ edit ] Thorold Gosset described the demipenteract in his 1900 publication listing all of the regular and semiregular figures in n -dimensions above three. He called it a 5-ic semi-regular . It also exists within the semiregular k 21 polytope family.

The demihypercubes can be represented by extended Schläfli symbols of the form h{4,3,...,3} as half the vertices of {4,3,...,3}. The vertex figures of demihypercubes are rectified n - simplexes .

Constructions [ edit ] They are represented by Coxeter-Dynkin diagrams of three constructive forms: ...

(As an alternated orthotope ) s{2 1,1,...,1 } ...

(As an alternated hypercube ) h{4,3 n −1 } ...

. (As a demihypercube) {3 1, n −3,1 } H.S.M. Coxeter also labeled the third bifurcating diagrams as 1 k 1 representing the lengths of the three branches and led by the ringed branch.

An n-demicube , n greater than 2, has n ( n −1)/2 edges meeting at each vertex. The graphs below show less edges at each vertex due to overlapping edges in the symmetry projection.

Vertices: D n ,0 = 1/2 C n ,0 = 2 n −1 (Half the n -cube vertices remain) Edges: D n ,1 = C n ,2 = 1/2 n ( n −1) 2 n −2 (All original edges lost, each square faces create a new edge) Faces: D n ,2 = 4 * C n ,3 = 2/3 n ( n −1)( n −2) 2 n −3 (All original faces lost, each cube creates 4 new triangular faces) Cells: D n ,3 = C n ,3 + 2 3 C n ,4 (tetrahedra from original cells plus new ones) Hypercells: D n ,4 = C n ,4 + 2 4 C n ,5 (16-cells and 5-cells respectively) ...

[For m = 3,..., n −1]: D n , m = C n , m + 2 m C n , m +1 ( m -demicubes and m -simplexes respectively) ...

Facets: D n , n −1 = 2 n + 2 n −1 (( n −1)-demicubes and ( n −1)-simplices respectively) Symmetry group [ edit ] The stabilizer of the demihypercube in the hyperoctahedral group (the Coxeter group B C n {\displaystyle BC_{n}} [4,3 n −1 ]) has index 2. It is the Coxeter group D n , {\displaystyle D_{n},} [3 n −3,1,1 ] of order 2 n − − 1 n !

{\displaystyle 2^{n-1}n!} , and is generated by permutations of the coordinate axes and reflections along pairs of coordinate axes.

[ 2 ] Orthotopic constructions [ edit ] The rhombic disphenoid inside of a cuboid Constructions as alternated orthotopes have the same topology, but can be stretched with different lengths in n -axes of symmetry.

The rhombic disphenoid is the three-dimensional example as alternated cuboid. It has three sets of edge lengths, and scalene triangle faces.
