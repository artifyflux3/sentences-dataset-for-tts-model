Among its various tenant commands, it houses the Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC PCD), the Center for Explosive Ordnance Disposal & Diving (CENEODDIVE), the Navy Experimental Diving Unit (NEDU), and Coast Guard Station Panama City .

History [ edit ] The NSA PC was founded as the U.S. Navy Mine Countermeasures Station on 20 July 1945, as a result of the transfer of the test station from Solomons, Maryland , but was renamed ca. 1955 to the U.S. Navy Mine Defense Laboratory . In 1972, it was renamed the Naval Coastal Systems Laboratory which changed to Naval Coastal Systems Center in 1981. The base has been a subsidiary of several other commands in the past including Naval Surface Warfare Center Carderock Division , and Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division , under which it was designated Naval Surface Warfare Center: Coastal Systems Station . It obtained its current name in 2007 after changing from the prior command structure to the tenant command structure used by the Navy today in its command of research and development centers.

In addition to waterfront port facilities, the installation also contains a hangar and a paved heliport facility approximately 300 feet by 400 feet in size to accommodate naval helicopters up to and including the MH-53E Sea Dragon . The Navy airfield identifier is NBV.
