1,097 [ 1 ] Damage (U.S.) $1.4 billion Fatalities (U.S.) 81 [ 2 ] Fatalities (worldwide) 135 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 This page documents the tornadoes and tornado outbreaks that occurred in 2007 , primarily (but not entirely) in the United States. Most tornadoes form in the U.S., although some events may take place internationally, particularly in parts of neighboring southern Canada during the summer season. Some tornadoes also take place in Europe, e. g. in the United Kingdom or in Germany.

Preliminary reports suggest that there were 1,305 reported tornadoes in the U.S. (of which 1,097 were confirmed), [ 3 ] with 81 confirmed fatalities. It was the deadliest year for tornadoes in the U.S. since 1999, when 95 deaths were reported.

[ 4 ] In addition, 25 fatalities took place in China, 23 in Chad , seven in Bangladesh , three each in Mexico and Vietnam, and one each in South Africa and the Philippines for a worldwide known total of at least 144.

Notably, the system for classifying tornado damage in the United States changed from the Fujita scale to the Enhanced Fujita Scale on February 1, 2007.

[ 5 ] Synopsis [ edit ] 2007 started quickly in terms of tornadoes, with the first tornado fatalities taking place in the first week of January. After few other significant events in the rest of January, a deadly period took place in the latter part of the winter. Two deadly outbreaks and several other major tornado events marred February and March, especially in the southern US.

The spring was also fairly active, with several significant tornado events in April and May, including a major outbreak in the first weekend of May that produced the first ever EF5 tornado , using the then-new Enhanced Fujita scale (as well as the first F5-equivalent tornado on any scale in the 21st century). While June was not as active, with fewer tornadoes, it produced Canada's first F5 tornado .

The tropics in the Western Hemisphere produced few significant tornadoes in 2007, but Typhoon Sepat produced a deadly tornado in China. Otherwise, the summer and early fall were fairly quiet, with a few local exceptions. The most severe outbreak in the second half of the year took place in October, when the largest outbreak ever recorded in that month took place.

The year ended slowly with no major outbreaks in November or December and only a few isolated tornadoes, mostly related to larger winter storms.

A low pressure system moved across much of central and eastern North America starting on June 6 in the central Plains and into the Mississippi Valley , Great Lakes region and eventually the Northeast over the following few days. On June 4, the Storm Prediction Center issued a moderate risk of severe weather for June 6, only the fourth such issuance for a day three outlook. On the morning of June 5, the Storm Prediction Center continued the moderate risk for June 6 and issued a moderate risk for June 7 over much of the Upper Midwest , making it the fifth time a moderate risk has been issued on day 3. Both were forwarded to days 1 and 2, respectively, on June 6.

[ 43 ] [ 84 ] On June 6, there were two distinct threats forecast. The central Plains were expected to see a large tornado outbreak potentially, particularly in Nebraska and the Dakotas close to the dry line , should the cap have broken in the atmosphere in the afternoon hours. In the evening and overnight hours, a major derecho with destructive winds and some scattered tornadoes were possible farther east, particularly in the eastern Dakotas, western Minnesota and western Iowa .

[ 76 ] However, that basically busted as little severe weather happened as the cap held up in most areas. Only five tornadoes and scattered wind reports took place.

The most severe damage was around Elie, Manitoba where several houses were flattened or swept away and numerous others damaged or destroyed. A flour mill was also destroyed and several trucks were overturned on Highway 1 . The tornado path was 3.7 miles (6.0 km) long, and was initially rated as an F4 on the Fujita Scale before detailed video debris analysis warranted an upgrade to F5 making it the first such tornado in Canada.

[ 94 ] Another tornado hit McHenry County, North Dakota ; it was an EF1 with moderate damage, mainly to trees and farm buildings.

[ 95 ] More tornadoes occurred on June 23.
