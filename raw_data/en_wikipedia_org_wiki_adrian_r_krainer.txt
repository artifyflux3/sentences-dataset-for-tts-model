[ 7 ] [ 8 ] Krainer is a co-founder and Director of Stoke Therapeutics, based in Bedford, MA.

Awards and honors [ edit ] In 2019 he was awarded a Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences for his contributions to the understanding of the RNA gene-splicing process and, in collaboration with fellow Prize Laureate Dr. Frank Bennet of Ionis Pharmaceuticals , the development of medical interventions that target the RNA-splicing process, including Spinraza , which is the first treatment for the genetic disorder Spinal Muscular Atrophy.

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] In 2021 Krainer received the Wolf Prize in Medicine .

[ 11 ] In 2024 he was awarded the Albany Medical Center Prize jointly with Howard Y. Chang and Lynne E. Maquat .

[ 12 ] Other honors include: Pew Scholar in the Biomedical Sciences (1992–96); National Institute of General Medical Sciences MERIT Award (2012-2022); New York Intellectual Property Law Association Inventor of the Year Award (2017); FE Bennett Award of the American Neurological Association (2017); RNA Society Lifetime Achievement Award (2019); Ross Prize in Molecular Medicine (2020); Gregor Johann Mendel Medal for Outstanding Achievements in Science (2020), Brno, Czech Republic; Fellow of the American Academy of Arts & Sciences (2016); Fellow of the National Academy of Inventors (2018); Member of the National Academy of Medicine (2019); Member of the National Academy of Sciences (2020) [ 1 ] Personal life [ edit ] Krainer's father and maternal grandparents were Holocaust refugees.
