Cauchy spaces were introduced by H. H. Keller in 1968, as an axiomatic tool derived from the idea of a Cauchy filter , in order to study completeness in topological spaces . The category of Cauchy spaces and Cauchy continuous maps is Cartesian closed , and contains the category of proximity spaces .

Definition [ edit ] Let X {\displaystyle X} be a set, P ( X ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {P}}(X)} the power set of X {\displaystyle X} , and assume all filters are proper (that is, a filter may not contain the empty set).

A Cauchy space is a pair ( X , C ) {\displaystyle (X,C)} consisting of a set X {\displaystyle X} together with a family C ⊆ ⊆ P ( P ( X ) ) {\displaystyle C\subseteq {\mathcal {P}}({\mathcal {P}}(X))} of (proper) filters on X {\displaystyle X} having all of the following properties: For each x ∈ ∈ X , {\displaystyle x\in X,} the discrete ultrafilter at x , {\displaystyle x,} denoted by U ( x ) , {\displaystyle U(x),} is in C .

{\displaystyle C.} If F ∈ ∈ C , {\displaystyle F\in C,} G {\displaystyle G} is a proper filter, and F {\displaystyle F} is a subset of G , {\displaystyle G,} then G ∈ ∈ C .

{\displaystyle G\in C.} If F , G ∈ ∈ C {\displaystyle F,G\in C} and if each member of F {\displaystyle F} intersects each member of G , {\displaystyle G,} then F ∩ ∩ G ∈ ∈ C .

{\displaystyle F\cap G\in C.} An element of C {\displaystyle C} is called a Cauchy filter , and a map f {\displaystyle f} between Cauchy spaces ( X , C ) {\displaystyle (X,C)} and ( Y , D ) {\displaystyle (Y,D)} is Cauchy continuous if ↑ ↑ f ( C ) ⊆ ⊆ D {\displaystyle \uparrow f(C)\subseteq D} ; that is, the image of each Cauchy filter in X {\displaystyle X} is a Cauchy filter base in Y .

{\displaystyle Y.} Properties and definitions [ edit ] Any Cauchy space is also a convergence space , where a filter F {\displaystyle F} converges to x {\displaystyle x} if F ∩ ∩ U ( x ) {\displaystyle F\cap U(x)} is Cauchy. In particular, a Cauchy space carries a natural topology .

Examples [ edit ] Any uniform space (hence any metric space , topological vector space , or topological group ) is a Cauchy space; see Cauchy filter for definitions.

A lattice-ordered group carries a natural Cauchy structure.

Any directed set A {\displaystyle A} may be made into a Cauchy space by declaring a filter F {\displaystyle F} to be Cauchy if, given any element n ∈ ∈ A , {\displaystyle n\in A,} there is an element U ∈ ∈ F {\displaystyle U\in F} such that U {\displaystyle U} is either a singleton or a subset of the tail { m : m ≥ ≥ n } .

{\displaystyle \{m:m\geq n\}.} Then given any other Cauchy space X , {\displaystyle X,} the Cauchy-continuous functions from A {\displaystyle A} to X {\displaystyle X} are the same as the Cauchy nets in X {\displaystyle X} indexed by A .

{\displaystyle A.} If X {\displaystyle X} is complete , then such a function may be extended to the completion of A , {\displaystyle A,} which may be written A ∪ ∪ { ∞ ∞ } ; {\displaystyle A\cup \{\infty \};} the value of the extension at ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \infty } will be the limit of the net. In the case where A {\displaystyle A} is the set { 1 , 2 , 3 , … … } {\displaystyle \{1,2,3,\ldots \}} of natural numbers (so that a Cauchy net indexed by A {\displaystyle A} is the same as a Cauchy sequence ), then A {\displaystyle A} receives the same Cauchy structure as the metric space { 1 , 1 / 2 , 1 / 3 , … … } .

{\displaystyle \{1,1/2,1/3,\ldots \}.} Category of Cauchy spaces [ edit ] The natural notion of morphism between Cauchy spaces is that of a Cauchy-continuous function , a concept that had earlier been studied for uniform spaces.
