Pseudoviridae is a family of viruses , [ 1 ] which includes three genera.

[ 2 ] Viruses of the family are actually LTR retrotransposons of the Ty1-copia family. They replicate via structures called virus-like particles (VLPs). VLPs are not infectious like normal virions, but they nevertheless make up an essential part of the pseudoviral lifecycle.

[ 2 ] Taxonomy [ edit ] Pseudoviridae is unofficially classified under group VI RNA Reverse Transcribing Viruses and infect fungi and invertebrates .

Pseudoviridae comprises highly divergent members and most Pseudoviridae encode Gag and Pol on a single open reading frame .

Pseudoviridae is included in the order Ortervirales along with families Belpaoviridae , Metaviridae , Retroviridae , and Caulimoviridae .

[ 3 ] The family includes the following genera: [ 2 ] Hemivirus Pseudovirus Sirevirus Further Pseudoviridae species not classified into a genus are: Penicillium camemberti virus – GP1 [ 4 ] Phaseolus vulgaris Tpv2-6 virus Genome [ edit ] Genome map of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ty1 virus The genome of viruses from this family is unsegmented, -RT, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA and is 4200–9700 nucleotides long. The genome encodes structural proteins and non-structural proteins which codes for an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (reverse transcriptase), replicase ,  with the reverse transcriptase for the reverse transcription step during replication .

Structure [ edit ] The viral capsid is unenveloped and looks roughly spherical. The capsid is round with icosahedral symmetry with triangulation number (T) = 3 and 4. It is also isometric to quasi-isometric and has a diameter of 30–50 nm. LTR- retrotransposons are poorly characterized and lipids have not reported.

Replication [ edit ] The genome integrates into the host genome and gets transcribed by host cell enzymes such as eukaryotic nuclear RNA polymerase II . Genome replication takes place in the host cytoplasm , or the nucleus and assembly can occur in the cytoplasm, or in the nucleus.
