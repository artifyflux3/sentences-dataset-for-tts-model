Members of the family are distinguished by persistent leaves borne on deciduous short shoots, subtended by scale-like leaves . The leaves are highly dissected (divided into partitions). They likely grew as trees and shrubs.

[ 1 ] The main ovulate structure of Czekanowskiales, Leptostrobus , consists of bivalved seed-bearing round capsule-like structures arranged along a long axis.

[ 2 ] The fossil record of Czekanowskiales is largely confined to the Northern Hemisphere, and they inhabited warm-temperate and temperate climates under humid conditions.

[ 3 ] The oldest possible records of the group are ovulate cones from the Late Permian of Italy, [ 1 ] but the group is primarily known from the Late Triassic onwards, and were abundant during the Jurassic and Early Cretaceous . Only a handful of species are known from the Late Cretaceous, confined to the northern Russian Far East , corresponding to the decline of other seed plant groups during the explosive radiation of flowering plants .

[ 4 ] The affinites of Czekanowskiales to other seed plants are obscure. A close relationship to the Ginkgoales has been proposed, based on similar preserved molecular signatures of fossil cuticles, [ 5 ] with some authors placing Ginkgoales and Czekanowskiales into the broader grouping Ginkgophyta.
