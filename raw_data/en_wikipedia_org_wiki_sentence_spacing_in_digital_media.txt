 You deserve an explanation 

August 17: An important update for readers in the United States. 

Please don't skip this 1-minute read. It's Sunday, August 17, and we're running a short fundraiser to support Wikipedia. If you've lost count of how many times you've visited Wikipedia this year, we hope that means it's given you at least $2.75 of knowledge. Please join the 2% of readers who give what they can to keep this valuable resource ad-free and available for all.

After nearly 25 years, Wikipedia is still the internet we were promised—created by people, not by machines. It's not perfect, but it's not here to push a point of view. It's owned by a non-profit, not a giant technology company or a billionaire.

Most readers donate because Wikipedia is useful to them, others because Wikipedia is more important than ever. If you feel the same, please donate $2.75 now—or consider a monthly gift to help all year. Thank you.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Horizontal width of inter-sentence space

**Sentence spacing in digital media** concerns the horizontal width of the space between sentences in computer- and web-based media. _Digital media_ allow [sentence spacing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_spacing "Sentence spacing") variations not possible with the [typewriter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typewriter "Typewriter"). Most [digital fonts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_fonts "Digital fonts") permit the use of a variable space or a [no-break space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-break_space "No-break space").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_spacing_in_digital_media#cite_note-1) Some modern font specifications, such as [OpenType](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenType "OpenType"), have the ability to automatically add or reduce space after punctuation,[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] and users may be able to choose sentence spacing variations.

Modern fonts allow spacing variations that the average user can easily manipulate, such as: non-breaking short spaces (thin spaces), non-breaking normal spaces (thick spaces), breaking normal spaces (thick spaces), and breaking long spaces (em spaces).

Word processors and text input programs
---------------------------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sentence_spacing_in_digital_media&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Word processors and text input programs")]

The typesetting software [TeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX "TeX") treats horizontal runs of [whitespace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitespace_character "Whitespace character") as a single space, but uses a [heuristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic "Heuristic") to recognize sentence endings—typesetting the spaces after them slightly wider than a normal space. This is the default for TeX, although the "`\frenchspacing`" TeX macro will disable this feature in favor of using the same amount of space between sentences as it does between words.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_spacing_in_digital_media#cite_note-2)

Computer [word processors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_processor "Word processor") will allow the user to input as many spaces as desired. Although the default setting for many applications' grammar-checkers (e.g., [Microsoft Word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word "Microsoft Word")) is single sentence spacing, they can be adjusted to recognize double sentence spacing as correct also. A program called PerfectIt is an "MS Word add-in that helps professionals to proofread faster". The producer states that a feature was added to the most recent version of their program (as of August 2009), "to convert two spaces at the end of a sentence into one", but they have "never had any requests to convert one space into two".[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_spacing_in_digital_media#cite_note-3)

Some [plaintext editors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editor "Text editor"), such as [Emacs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs "Emacs") and [vi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi_(text_editor) "Vi (text editor)"), originally relied on double-spacing to recognize sentence boundaries. By default, Emacs will not break a line at a single space preceded by a period, but this behavior is configurable (with the option `sentence-end-double-space`). More than one space will be preserved, but no additional space will be added automatically if it lacks. There are also functions to move the cursor forward or backward to the next double-space in the text. In [Vim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor) "Vim (text editor)") the `joinspaces` setting indicates whether extra spaces are inserted when joining lines together, and the `J` flag in `cpoptions` indicates whether a sentence must be followed by two spaces. The [GNU coding standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_coding_standards "GNU coding standards") recommend using two spaces when coding comments.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_spacing_in_digital_media#cite_note-4) This also applies to software documentation in the GNU project. The optional Emacs mode LaTeX provides a toggling option `French-LaTeX-mode` which, if set to `French`, creates single sentence spacing after terminal punctuation.

Web browsers
------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sentence_spacing_in_digital_media&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Web browsers")]

[Web browsers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser "Web browser") follow the [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML "HTML") display specification and for programmers' convenience ignore runs of [white space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitespace_(computer_science) "Whitespace (computer science)") when displaying them.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_spacing_in_digital_media#cite_note-5) This convention originally comes from the underlying [SGML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SGML "SGML") standard, which [collapses multiple spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitespace_collapsing "Whitespace collapsing") because of the clear division between content and layout information.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_spacing_in_digital_media#cite_note-tomweb-6) In order to force a web browser to display multiple spaces, a special character sequence must be used (such as "`&ensp;&thinsp;`" for an [en-space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/En_(typography) "En (typography)") followed by a thin space, "`&emsp;`" for an [em-space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Em_(typography) "Em (typography)"), or "`&nbsp;&nbsp;`" for two successive full spaces).[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_spacing_in_digital_media#cite_note-7) However, using a non-breaking space can lead to uneven [justified text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justification_(typesetting) "Justification (typesetting)") and additional unwanted spaces or [line breaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_return "Soft return") in the text in certain programs.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_spacing_in_digital_media#cite_note-8) Alternatively, sentence spacing can be controlled in HTML by separating every sentence into a separate element (e.g., a span), and using CSS to finely control sentence spacing.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_spacing_in_digital_media#cite_note-tomformat-9) This is seldom done in practice.

To specify and allow multiple spaces to be rendered without collapsing in a web browser, the HTML `<pre>` tag or [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS "CSS")`white-space` property can be employed.

Character encodings
-------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sentence_spacing_in_digital_media&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Character encodings")]

[ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII "ASCII") and similar early character encodings provide only a single space, which is breaking and fixed-width (the particular width specified by the respective font). [EBCDIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBCDIC "EBCDIC"), although earlier than ASCII, provided a breaking fixed-width space (_SP_), a non-breaking fixed-width space (_RSP_: "Required SPace"), and an alternate-width non-breaking fixed-width space intended for use in numeric lists with fixed-width (but not necessarily em-width) digits (_NSP_: "Numeric SPace"). [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML "HTML") and [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode "Unicode") can both record runs of consecutive spaces—including multiple-width spaces, and breaking and non-breaking spaces. HTML provides four variations on space width and one fixed-width non-breaking space: `<space>`, `&emsp;`, `&ensp;`, and `&thinsp;` (all breaking); and `&nbsp;` (non-breaking). In a typewriter font, `<space>` will equal `&emsp;`, but will vary according to the font designer's specification in all other fonts, whether proportional or monospace. The HTML standard also specifies display behavior, not just character encoding, so web browsers following the HTML standard will collapse multiple `<space>`s to a single `<space>`. Non-browser applications that use HTML encoding will not necessarily behave this way at display-time, e.g., later versions of Microsoft Word. Unicode provides 15 variations on space width and breakability, including: THIN SPACE &#8201; and NARROW NO-BREAK SPACE &#8239.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_spacing_in_digital_media#cite_note-10) The following examples demonstrate the effect of these variations on a web browser—using space before punctuation to illustrate identical possible spacing variations following terminal punctuation. These spacing variations, combined with a standard word space, enable users to create custom sentence spacing—as alternatives to a single or double standard word space.

> *   No space before the exclamation mark!
> *   A no-break space before the exclamation mark!
> *   A THIN SPACE (`&#8201;`) before the exclamation mark!
> *   A NARROW NO-BREAK SPACE (`&#8239;`) before the exclamation mark !
> *   A small-formatted no-break space before the exclamation mark!
