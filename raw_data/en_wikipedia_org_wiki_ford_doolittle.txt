Kluge Center at the Library of Congress in 2016 Born W. Ford Doolittle ( 1941-11-30 ) November 30, 1941 (age 83) Urbana, Illinois , U.S.

Education Harvard University (BA 1963), Stanford University (PhD 1967), NSCAD University , Nova Scotia (BA in photography) Known for Horizontal gene transfer in prokaryotic evolution Awards National Academy of Sciences , Royal Society of Canada Scientific career Fields Cyanobacteria, chloroplasts Institutions Dalhousie University Doctoral advisor Charles Yanofsky W. Ford Doolittle CC FRSC FRS (born in November 30, 1941 in Urbana, Illinois ) [ 1 ] is an evolutionary and molecular biologist . He is a member of the US National Academy of Sciences a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada , a Fellow of the Royal Society (United Kingdom) and of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters .

[ 2 ] He is also the winner of the 2013 Herzberg Medal of the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [ 3 ] and the 2017 Killam Prize .

[ 4 ] In June 2025 he was appointed as a Companion of the Order of Canada .

[ 5 ] Doolittle has made significant contributions to the study of cyanobacteria . He found evidence for the endosymbiont origins of chloroplasts , and developed a theoretical basis for the initial evolution of eukaryotes . He has shown the importance of horizontal gene transfer in prokaryotic evolution.

As of 2007 [update] , he has been professor emeritus at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia .

[ 6 ] He received his BA in biochemical sciences from Harvard University in 1963 and his PhD from Stanford University in 1967, under Charles Yanofsky . He went on to do postdoctoral fellowships with Sol Spiegelman and Norman R. Pace .

In 1981, Doolittle received some level of notoriety for his article in The CoEvolution Quarterly entitled "Is Nature Really Motherly?".  This was a sharp rebuttal of J. E. Lovelock 's formulation of the Gaia Theory . Doolittle's article is often cited by Lovelock's critics. He has had a re-think about Gaia, publishing an open access book, Darwinizing Gaia , in 2024, with MIT Press.

Because of his philosophical musings on the non-existence of an all-encompassing Tree of life , Doolittle has occasionally been cited on Intelligent Design blogs. However, though Doolittle argues that a bifurcating tree is not an adequate metaphor for the evolution of life on earth, he is not a supporter of Intelligent Design . A single common ancestor and tree relating all of life on earth is not a necessary component of the theory of descent with modification, the essence of evolution.

Doolittle is currently involved in a debate about the proper use of function (biology) within evolutionary biology sparked by controversy over the results of the ENCODE consortium stating that 80% of the genome is "functional".

[ 7 ] He is a supporter of the concept of junk DNA .

In addition to his contributions to evolutionary biology, Doolittle is an artist who studied at NSCAD University , achieving a BA in photography.
