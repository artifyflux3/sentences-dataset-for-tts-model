**American English**, sometimes called **United States English** or **U.S. English**,[[c]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-6) is the set of [varieties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(linguistics) "Variety (linguistics)") of the [English language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language "English language") native to the United States.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-7) English is the [most widely spoken language in the U.S.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_the_United_States "Languages of the United States") and is an official language in 32 of the 50 [U.S. states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state "U.S. state") and the _[de facto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De\_facto "De facto")_ common language used in government, education, and commerce in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and in all territories except [Puerto Rico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rico "Puerto Rico").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-WestVirginia-8) While there is no law designating English as the official language of the U.S., [Executive Order 14224](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_14224 "Executive Order 14224") of 2025 declares it to be.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-9)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-:1-10) Since the late 20th century, American English has become the most influential form of English worldwide.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-:0-11)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-12)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-bbc-13)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-14)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-15)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-16)

Varieties of American English include many patterns of pronunciation, vocabulary, grammar, and particularly spelling that are unified nationwide but distinct from other forms of English around the world.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKretzchmar2004262%E2%80%93263-17) Any [American or Canadian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_English "North American English") accent perceived as lacking noticeably local, ethnic, or cultural [markers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markedness "Markedness") is known in [linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics "Linguistics") as [General American](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_American "General American");[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-:0-11) it covers a fairly uniform [accent continuum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialect_continuum "Dialect continuum") native to certain regions of the U.S. but especially associated with broadcast mass media and highly educated speech. However, historical and present linguistic evidence does not support the notion of there being one single mainstream American [accent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accent_(sociolinguistics) "Accent (sociolinguistics)").[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-FOOTNOTELabov20121%E2%80%932-18)[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKretzchmar2004262-19) The sound of American English continues to evolve, with some local accents disappearing, but several larger regional accents having emerged in the 20th century.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-PBS-20)

The use of English in the United States is a result of [British colonization of the Americas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_colonization_of_the_Americas "British colonization of the Americas"). The first wave of English-speaking settlers arrived in [North America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America "North America") during the early 17th century, followed by further migrations in the 18th and 19th centuries. During the 17th and 18th centuries, dialects from many different regions of [England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England "England") and the [British Isles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Isles "British Isles") existed in every American colony, allowing a process of extensive [dialect leveling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialect_levelling "Dialect levelling") and [mixing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koineization "Koineization") in which English varieties across the [Thirteen Colonies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteen_Colonies "Thirteen Colonies") became more homogeneous compared with the varieties in the British Isles.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKretzchmar2004258%E2%80%939-21)[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-FOOTNOTELongmore2007517,_520-22) English thus predominated in the colonies even by the end of the 17th century's first immigration of non-English speakers from [Western Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Europe "Western Europe") and [Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa "Africa").

Firsthand descriptions of a fairly uniform American English (particularly in contrast to the diverse regional dialects of British English) became common after the mid-18th century,[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-FOOTNOTELongmore2007537-23) while at the same time speakers' identification with this new variety increased.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-Paulsen2022-24) Since the 18th century, American English has developed into some new varieties, including regional dialects that retain minor influences from waves of immigrant speakers of diverse languages, primarily European languages.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-Hickey-25)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-bbc-13)

Some racial and regional variation in American English reflects these groups' patterns of geographic settlement, segregation, and resettlement. This can be seen, for example, in the influence of 18th-century Protestant [Ulster Scots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster_Scots_people "Ulster Scots people") immigrants (known in the U.S. as the [Scotch-Irish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotch-Irish_Americans "Scotch-Irish Americans")) in [Appalachia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appalachia "Appalachia") developing [Appalachian English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appalachian_English "Appalachian English") and the 20th-century [Great Migration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Migration_(African_American) "Great Migration (African American)") bringing [African-American Vernacular English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_Vernacular_English "African-American Vernacular English") to the [Great Lakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Lakes_region "Great Lakes region") urban centers.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-Hickey-25)[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-26)

Most American English accents fall under an umbrella known as [General American](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_American "General American"). Rather than one particular accent, General American is a spectrum of those American accents that Americans themselves do not associate with some particular region, ethnicity, or socioeconomic group. General American features are used most by Americans in formal contexts or who are highly educated. Regional accents whose native features are perceived as General American include the accents of the North Midland (parts of the Midwest), Western New England, and the West.

The General American sound system's scope of influence and degree of expansion has been debated by linguists since the term was first used roughly a century ago. Many late-20th and early-21st century studies are showing that it is gradually ousting the regional accents in urban areas of the South and the interior North, New York City, Philadelphia, and many other areas. It can generally be said that younger Americans are avoiding their traditional local features in favor of this more nationwide norm. Furthermore, even General American itself appears to be evolving, with linguists identifying new features in speakers born since the last quarter of the 20th century, like a [merger of the low-back vowels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cot-caught_merger "Cot-caught merger") and a potentially [related vowel shift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-back-merger_shift "Low-back-merger shift"), that are spreading across the nation.

### Phonological features

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=American_English&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Phonological features")]

Phonological (accent) features that are typical of American dialects—in contrast to British dialects—include features that concern consonants, such as [rhoticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhoticity_in_English "Rhoticity in English") (pronunciation of all historical /r/ sounds), [T and D flapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flapping "Flapping") (with _metal_ and _medal_ pronounced the same, as [ˈmɛɾɫ̩]), [velarization of L](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_L "Dark L") in all contexts (with _filling_ pronounced [ˈfɪɫɪŋ], not [ˈfɪlɪŋ]), and [yod-dropping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yod-dropping "Yod-dropping") after [alveolar consonants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alveolar_consonant "Alveolar consonant") (with _new_ pronounced /nu/, not /nju/). Like many British accents, [T glottalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_glottalization "T glottalization") is the norm in American accents, though only in particular [environments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonetic_environment "Phonetic environment") (with _satin_ pronounced [ˈsæʔn̩], not [ˈsætn̩]).[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-Wells_1982-27)

American features that concern vowel sounds include various [vowel mergers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel_merger "Vowel merger") before /r/ (so that _Mary_, _marry_, and _merry_ are all commonly [pronounced the same](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary%E2%80%93marry%E2%80%93merry_merger "Mary–marry–merry merger")), raising and gliding of pre-nasal /æ/ (with _man_ having a higher and tenser vowel sound than _map_), the [weak vowel merger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_vowel_merger "Weak vowel merger") (with _affecting_ and _effecting_ often pronounced the same), and at least one of the LOT vowel mergers. Specifically, the [LOT–PALM merger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Father%E2%80%93bother_merger "Father–bother merger") is complete among most Americans and the [LOT–THOUGHT merger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cot-caught_merger "Cot-caught merger") among roughly half. A three-way LOT–PALM–THOUGHT merger is also very common.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-Wells_1982-27)[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-28) Most Americans pronounce the [diphthong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diphthong "Diphthong")/aɪ/ before a [voiceless consonant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiceless_consonant "Voiceless consonant") different from that same vowel before a [voiced consonant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiced_consonant "Voiced consonant"): thus, in _price_ and _bright_ versus in _prize_ and _bride_. For many, outside the South, the first element of the diphthong is a higher and shorter vowel sound when in pre-voiceless position as opposed to pre-voiced position. All of these phenomena are explained in further detail under General American.

Studies on historical usage of English in both the United States and the United Kingdom suggest that, while spoken American English deviated away from [period British English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Modern_English "Early Modern English") in many ways, it is [conservative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_conservatism "Linguistic conservatism") in a few other ways, preserving certain features 20th- and 21st-century [British English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English "British English") has since lost: namely, rhoticity. Unlike American accents, the [traditional standard accent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Received_Pronunciation "Received Pronunciation") of (southern) England has evolved a [_trap–bath_ split](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trap%E2%80%93bath_split "Trap–bath split"). Moreover, American accents preserve /h/ at the start of syllables, while perhaps a majority of the regional dialects of England participate in [/h/ dropping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-dropping "H-dropping"), particularly in informal contexts.

The process of coining new lexical items started as soon as English-speaking colonists in North America began borrowing names for unfamiliar flora, fauna, and topography from the [Native American languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_American_languages "Native American languages").[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-Skeat-29) Examples of such names are _[opossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia\_opossum "Virginia opossum"), [raccoon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raccoon "Raccoon"), [squash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squash\_(fruit) "Squash (fruit)")_, _[moose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moose "Moose")_ (from [Algonquian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algonquian_languages "Algonquian languages")),[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-Skeat-29)_[wigwam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wigwam "Wigwam")_, and _[moccasin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moccasin "Moccasin")_. American English speakers have integrated traditionally non-English terms and expressions into the mainstream cultural lexicon; for instance, _[en masse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/En\_masse "En masse")_, from [French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language "French language"); _[cookie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cookie "Cookie")_, from [Dutch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Language "Dutch Language"); _[kindergarten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kindergarten "Kindergarten")_ from [German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language "German language"),[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-30) and _[rodeo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodeo "Rodeo")_ from [Spanish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language "Spanish language").[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-31)[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-32)[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-33)[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-34) Landscape features are often loanwords from French or Spanish, and the word _[corn](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/corn "wikt:corn")_, used in England to refer to wheat (or any cereal), came to denote the [maize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maize "Maize") plant, the [most important crop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corn_production_in_the_United_States "Corn production in the United States") in the U.S.

Other common differences between UK and American English include: _aerial_ (UK) vs. _antenna_, _biscuit_ (UK) vs. _cookie/cracker_, _car park_ (UK) vs. _parking lot_, _caravan_ (UK) vs. _trailer_, _city centre_ (UK) vs. _downtown_, _flat_ (UK) vs. _apartment_, _fringe_ (UK; for hair hanging over the forehead) vs. _bangs_, and _holiday_ (UK) vs. _vacation_.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-35)

Most [Mexican Spanish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_Spanish "Mexican Spanish") contributions came after the [War of 1812](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_1812 "War of 1812"), with the opening of the West, like _[ranch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranch "Ranch")_ (now a common [house style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranch_house "Ranch house")). Due to Mexican culinary influence, many Spanish words are incorporated in general use when talking about certain popular dishes: cilantro (instead of coriander), queso, tacos, quesadillas, enchiladas, tostadas, fajitas, burritos, and guacamole. These words usually lack an English equivalent and are found in popular restaurants. New forms of dwelling created new terms _([lot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land\_lot "Land lot"), waterfront)_ and types of homes like _[log cabin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log\_cabin "Log cabin"), [adobe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe "Adobe")_ in the 18th century; _[apartment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartment "Apartment"), [shanty](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/shanty "wikt:shanty")_ in the 19th century; _project, [condominium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condominium\_(living\_space) "Condominium (living space)"), [townhouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Townhouse "Townhouse"), [mobile home](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile\_home "Mobile home")_ in the 20th century; and parts thereof _([driveway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driveway "Driveway"), breezeway, [backyard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backyard "Backyard"))_.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] Industry and material innovations from the 19th century onwards provide distinctive new words, phrases, and idioms through [railroading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railroad "Railroad") (see further at [rail terminology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_terminology "Rail terminology")) and [transportation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport "Transport") terminology, ranging from types of roads (_dirt roads_, _[freeways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeway "Freeway")_) to infrastructure _([parking lot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parking\_lot "Parking lot"), [overpass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overpass "Overpass"), [rest area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rest\_area "Rest area")),_ to automotive terminology often now standard in English internationally.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-36) Already existing English words—such as _[store](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General\_store "General store"), [shop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retailing "Retailing"), [lumber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumber "Lumber")_—underwent shifts in meaning; others remained in the U.S. while changing in Britain. Science, urbanization, and democracy have been important factors in bringing about changes in the written and spoken language of the United States.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-37) From the world of business and finance came new terms (_[merger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mergers\_and\_acquisitions "Mergers and acquisitions"), [downsize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layoff "Layoff"), [bottom line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net\_income "Net income")_), from sports and gambling terminology came, specific jargon aside, common everyday American idioms, including [many idioms related to baseball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language_idioms_derived_from_baseball "English language idioms derived from baseball"). The names of some American inventions remained largely confined to North America (_[elevator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator "Elevator")_ [except [in the aeronautical sense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator_(aeronautics) "Elevator (aeronautics)")], _[gasoline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline "Gasoline")_) as did certain automotive terms (_[truck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truck "Truck")_, _[trunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trunk\_(car) "Trunk (car)")_).[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

New foreign loanwords came with 19th and early 20th century European immigration to the U.S.; notably, from [Yiddish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yiddish_language "Yiddish language")_([chutzpah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chutzpah "Chutzpah"), schmooze, bupkis, [glitch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glitch "Glitch")_) and [German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language "German language") (_[hamburger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburger "Hamburger"), [wiener](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot\_dog "Hot dog")_).[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-38)[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-FOOTNOTETrudgill2004-39) A large number of English colloquialisms from various periods are American in origin; some have lost their American flavor (from _[OK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OK "OK")_ and _cool_ to _[nerd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerd "Nerd")_ and _[24/7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24/7 "24/7")),_ while others have not _([have a nice day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Have\_a\_nice\_day "Have a nice day"), for sure);_[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-40)[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-41) many are now distinctly old-fashioned _(swell, groovy)._ Some English words now in general use, such as _hijacking, [disc jockey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disc\_jockey "Disc jockey"), boost, bulldoze_ and _[jazz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz "Jazz"),_ originated as American slang.

American English has always shown a marked tendency to [use words in different parts of speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthimeria "Anthimeria") and nouns are [often used as verbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_shift "Functional shift").[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-FOOTNOTETrudgill200469-42) Examples of nouns that are now also verbs are _interview, advocate, vacuum, lobby, pressure, rear-end, transition, feature, profile, hashtag, head, divorce, loan, estimate, X-ray, spearhead, skyrocket, showcase, bad-mouth, [vacation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacation "Vacation"), major,_ and many others. [Compounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_(linguistics) "Compound (linguistics)") coined in the U.S. are for instance _[foothill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foothill "Foothill"), [landslide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landslide "Landslide")_ (in all senses), _[backdrop](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/backdrop "wikt:backdrop"), [teenager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenager "Teenager"),_ _[brainstorm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainstorming "Brainstorming"), [bandwagon](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bandwagon "wikt:bandwagon"), [hitchhike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitchhike "Hitchhike"), smalltime,_ and a huge number of others. Other compound words have been founded based on industrialization and the wave of the automobile: five-passenger car, four-door sedan, two-door sedan, and station-wagon (called an estate car in British English).[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-43) Some are euphemistic _([human resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human\_resources "Human resources"), [affirmative action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirmative\_action "Affirmative action"), [correctional facility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correctional\_facility "Correctional facility"))._ Many compound nouns have the verb-and-preposition combination: _stopover, lineup, tryout, spin-off, [shootout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shootout "Shootout"), holdup, hideout, comeback, [makeover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makeover "Makeover"),_ and many more. Some prepositional and [phrasal verbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrasal_verb "Phrasal verb") are in fact of American origin (_win out, hold up, back up/off/down/out, face up to_ and many others).[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-44)

Noun endings such as _-ee (retiree), -ery (bakery), -ster (gangster)_ and _-cian (beautician)_ are also particularly productive in the U.S.[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-FOOTNOTETrudgill200469-42) Several verbs ending in _-ize_ are of U.S. origin; for example, _fetishize, prioritize, burglarize, accessorize, [weatherize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weatherization "Weatherization"),_ etc.; and so are some [back-formations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back-formation "Back-formation")_(locate, fine-tune, curate, donate, emote, upholster_ and _enthuse)._ Among syntactic constructions that arose are _outside of, headed for, meet up with, back of,_ etc. Americanisms formed by alteration of some existing words include notably _pesky, phony, rambunctious, buddy, [sundae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundae "Sundae"), skeeter, sashay_ and _kitty-corner._ Adjectives that arose in the U.S. are, for example, _lengthy, bossy, [cute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuteness "Cuteness")_ and _cutesy, punk_ (in all senses), _sticky_ (of the weather), _through_ (as in "finished"), and many colloquial forms such as _peppy_ or _wacky_.

A number of words and meanings that originated in [Middle English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_English "Middle English") or [Early Modern English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Modern_English "Early Modern English") and that have been in everyday use in the United States have since disappeared in most varieties of British English; some of these have cognates in [Lowland Scots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Lowlands "Scottish Lowlands"). Terms such as _[fall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autumn "Autumn")_ ("autumn"), _[faucet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faucet "Faucet")_ ("tap"), _[diaper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaper "Diaper")_ ("nappy"; itself unused in the U.S.), _[candy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candy "Candy")_ ("sweets"), _[skillet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frying\_pan "Frying pan")_, _[eyeglasses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyeglasses "Eyeglasses")_, and _[obligate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obligate "Obligate")_ are often regarded as Americanisms. _Fall_, however, came to denote the season in 16th century England, a contraction of Middle English expressions like "fall of the leaf" and "fall of the year".[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-45)[_[better source needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTRS "Wikipedia:NOTRS")_]_Gotten_ ([past participle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Past_participle "Past participle") of _get_) is often considered to be largely an Americanism.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-bbc-13)[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-46) Other words and meanings were brought back to Britain from the U.S., especially in the second half of the 20th century; these include _hire_ ("to employ"), _I guess_ (famously criticized by [H. W. Fowler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._W._Fowler "H. W. Fowler")), _[baggage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baggage "Baggage")_, _hit_ (a place), and the adverbs _overly_ and _presently_ ("currently"). Some of these, for example, _[monkey wrench](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey\_wrench "Monkey wrench")_ and _[wastebasket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wastebasket "Wastebasket")_, originated in 19th century Britain. The adjectives _mad_ meaning "angry", _smart_ meaning "intelligent", and _sick_ meaning "ill" are also more frequent in American (and Irish) English than British English.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-47)[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-48)[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-49)

Linguist [Bert Vaux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bert_Vaux "Bert Vaux") created a survey, completed in 2003, polling English speakers across the United States about their specific everyday word choices, hoping to identify regionalisms.[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-50) The study found that most Americans prefer the term _sub_ for a long sandwich, _soda_ (but _pop_ in the Great Lakes region and generic _coke_ in the South) for a sweet and bubbly [soft drink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_drink "Soft drink"),[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-51)_you_ or _you guys_ for the plural of _you_ (but _y'all_ in the South), _[sneakers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneakers#Names\_and\_etymology "Sneakers")_ for athletic shoes (but often _tennis shoes_ outside the Northeast), and _[shopping cart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shopping\_cart "Shopping cart")_ for a cart used for carrying supermarket goods.

Grammar and orthography
-----------------------

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=American_English&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Grammar and orthography")]

American English and [British English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English "British English") (BrE) differ in somewhat minor ways in their grammar and writing conventions. The first large American dictionary, _An American Dictionary of the English Language_, known as [Webster's Dictionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webster%27s_Dictionary "Webster's Dictionary"), was written by [Noah Webster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Webster "Noah Webster") in 1828, codifying several of these spellings.

Differences in grammar are relatively minor, and do not normally affect mutual intelligibility; these include: typically a lack of differentiation between adjectives and adverbs, employing the equivalent adjectives as adverbs _he ran quick_/_he ran quickly_; different use of some [auxiliary verbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auxiliary_verb "Auxiliary verb"); formal (rather than notional) agreement with [collective nouns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_noun "Collective noun"); different preferences for the past forms of a few verbs (for example, AmE/BrE: _learned_/_learnt_, _burned_/_burnt_, _snuck/sneaked_, _dove/dived_) although the purportedly "British" forms can occasionally be seen in American English writing as well; different prepositions and adverbs in certain contexts (for example, AmE _in school,_ BrE _at school_); and whether or not a definite article is used, in very few cases (AmE _to the hospital_, BrE _to hospital_; contrast, however, AmE _actress Elizabeth Taylor_, BrE _the actress Elizabeth Taylor_). Often, these differences are a matter of relative preferences rather than absolute rules; and most are not stable since the two varieties are constantly influencing each other,[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-52) and American English is not a standardized set of dialects.

Differences in [orthography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthography "Orthography") are also minor. The main differences are that American English usually uses spellings such as _flavor_ for British _flavour_, _fiber_ for _fibre_, _defense_ for _defence_, _analyze_ for _analyse_, _license_ for _licence_, _catalog_ for _catalogue_ and _traveling_ for _travelling_. Noah Webster popularized such spellings in America, but he did not invent most of them. Rather, "he chose already existing options on such grounds as simplicity, analogy or etymology."[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-53) Other differences are due to the [francophile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francophile "Francophile") tastes of the 19th century [Victorian era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_era "Victorian era") Britain (for example they preferred _programme_ for _program_, _manoeuvre_ for _maneuver_, _cheque_ for _check_, etc.).[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-54) AmE almost always uses _-ize_ in words like _realize_. BrE prefers _-ise_, but also uses _-ize_ on occasion (see: [Oxford spelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_spelling "Oxford spelling")).

There are a few differences in punctuation rules. British English is more tolerant of [run-on sentences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-on_sentences "Run-on sentences"), called "[comma splices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma_splice "Comma splice")" in American English, and American English prefers that periods and commas be placed inside closing quotation marks even in cases in which British rules would place them outside. American English also favors the double quotation mark ("like this") over the single ('as here').[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-APA-55)

AmE sometimes favors words that are [morphologically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(linguistics) "Morphology (linguistics)") more complex, whereas BrE uses clipped forms, such as AmE _transportation_ and BrE _transport_ or where the British form is a [back-formation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back-formation "Back-formation"), such as AmE _burglarize_ and BrE _burgle_ (from _burglar_). However, while individuals usually use one or the other, both forms will be widely understood and mostly used alongside each other within the two systems.

[![Image 1](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/USA_location_map.svg/960px-USA_location_map.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:USA_location_map.svg)

The map above shows the major regional dialects of American English (in [all caps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_caps "All caps")) plus smaller and more local dialects, as demarcated primarily by Labov et al.'s _[The Atlas of North American English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Atlas\_of\_North\_American\_English "The Atlas of North American English")_,[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-FOOTNOTELabovAshBoberg2006148-56) as well as the related Telsur Project's regional maps.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-57) Any region may also contain speakers of a "General American" accent that resists the marked features of their region. Furthermore, this map does not account for speakers of ethnic or cultural varieties (such as [African-American English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_English "African-American English"), [Chicano English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicano_English "Chicano English"), [Cajun English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cajun_English "Cajun English"), etc.).

While written American English is largely standardized across the country and spoken American English dialects are highly mutually intelligible, there are still several recognizable regional and ethnic accents, alongside mostly minor distinctions in vocabulary, grammatical structures, and other features.

The regional sounds of present-day American English are reportedly engaged in a complex phenomenon of "both convergence and divergence": some accents are homogenizing and [leveling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accent_leveling "Accent leveling"), while others are diversifying and deviating further away from one another.[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-FOOTNOTELabov2012-58) In 2010, [William Labov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Labov "William Labov") noted that Great Lakes, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and West Coast accents have undergone "vigorous new sound changes" since the mid-nineteenth century onwards, so they "are now more different from each other than they were 50 or 100 years ago", while other accents, like those of New York City and Boston, have remained stable in that same timeframe.[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-FOOTNOTELabov2012-58)

Having been settled longer than the American West Coast, the East Coast has had more time to develop unique accents, and it currently comprises three or four linguistically significant regions, each of which possesses English varieties both different from each other as well as quite internally diverse: [New England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England "New England"), the [Mid-Atlantic states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Atlantic_states "Mid-Atlantic states") (including a [New York accent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_accent "New York accent") as well as a unique [Philadelphia–Baltimore accent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Atlantic_American_English "Mid-Atlantic American English")), and the [South](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States "Southern United States"). As of the 20th century, the middle and eastern [Great Lakes area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Lakes_area "Great Lakes area"), Chicago being the largest city with these speakers, also ushered in certain unique features, including the [fronting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fronting_(phonetics) "Fronting (phonetics)") of the LOT/ɑ/ vowel in the mouth toward [a] and [tensing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenseness "Tenseness") of the TRAP/æ/ vowel wholesale to [eə]. These sound changes have triggered a series of other [vowel shifts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel_shift "Vowel shift") in the same region, known by linguists as the "[Inland North](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inland_North "Inland North")".[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-FOOTNOTELabovAshBoberg2006190-59) The Inland North shares with the [Eastern New England dialect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_New_England_English "Eastern New England English") (including [Boston accents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_accent "Boston accent")) a [backer tongue positioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_vowel "Back vowel") of the GOOSE/u/ vowel (to [u]) and the MOUTH/aʊ/ vowel (to [ɑʊ~äʊ]) in comparison to the rest of the country.[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-FOOTNOTELabovAshBoberg2006230-60) Ranging from northern New England across the Great Lakes to Minnesota, another Northern regional marker is the variable fronting of /ɑ/ before /r/,[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-FOOTNOTELabovAshBoberg2006111-61) for example, appearing four times in the stereotypical Boston [shibboleth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibboleth "Shibboleth")_Park the car in Harvard Yard_.[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-62)

[![Image 2](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/Non-RhoticityUSA.png/330px-Non-RhoticityUSA.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Non-RhoticityUSA.png)

The red dots show every U.S. metropolitan area where over 50% non-rhotic speech was documented among some of that area's white speakers in the 1990s. Non-rhoticity may be heard among [black speakers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_English "African-American English") throughout the whole country.[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-63)

Several other phenomena serve to distinguish regional American accents. [Boston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_English "New England English"), [Pittsburgh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Pennsylvania_English "Western Pennsylvania English"), [Upper Midwestern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North-Central_American_English "North-Central American English"), and [Western U.S. accents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_American_English "Western American English") have fully completed a merger of the LOT vowel with the THOUGHT vowel (/ɑ/ and /ɔ/, respectively):[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-FOOTNOTELabovAshBoberg200660-64) a [_cot–caught_ merger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cot%E2%80%93caught_merger "Cot–caught merger"), which is rapidly spreading throughout the whole country. However, the South, Inland North, and a Northeastern coastal corridor passing through Rhode Island, New York City, Philadelphia, and Baltimore typically preserve an older _cot–caught_ distinction.[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-FOOTNOTELabovAshBoberg2006190-59) For that Northeastern corridor, the realization of the THOUGHT vowel is particularly [marked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markedness "Markedness"), as depicted in humorous spellings, like in _tawk_ and _cawfee_ (_talk_ and _coffee_), which intend to represent it being [tense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenseness "Tenseness") and [diphthongal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diphthong "Diphthong"): [oə].[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-65) A [split of TRAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%86_tensing "Æ tensing") into two separate [phonemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoneme "Phoneme"), using different _a_ pronunciations for example in _gap_[æ] versus _gas_[eə], further defines New York City as well as Philadelphia–Baltimore accents.[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-FOOTNOTELabovAshBoberg2006173-66)

Most Americans preserve all historical /r/ sounds, using what is known as a [rhotic accent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhoticity_in_English "Rhoticity in English"). The only traditional _r_-dropping (or non-rhoticity) in regional American accents variably appears today in [eastern New England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_New_England_English "Eastern New England English"), [New York City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_English "New York City English"), and some of the [former plantation South](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Older_Southern_American_English "Older Southern American English") primarily among older speakers (and, relatedly, some [African-American Vernacular English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_Vernacular_English "African-American Vernacular English") across the country), though the vowel-consonant cluster found in "bird", "work", "hurt", "learn", etc. usually retains its _r_ pronunciation, even in these non-rhotic American accents. Non-rhoticity among such speakers is presumed to have arisen from their upper classes' close historical contact with England, imitating London's _r_-dropping, a feature that has continued to gain prestige throughout England from the late 18th century onwards,[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-FOOTNOTETrudgill200446%E2%80%9347-67) but which has conversely lost prestige in the U.S. since at least the early 20th century.[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-FOOTNOTELabovAshBoberg20065,_47-68) Non-rhoticity makes a word like _car_ sound like _cah_ or _source_ like _sauce_.[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-FOOTNOTELabovAshBoberg2006137,_141-69)

New York City and [Southern accents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_American_English "Southern American English") are the most widely recognized regional accents in the country, as well as the most stigmatized and socially disfavored.[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-70) Southern speech, strongest in southern Appalachia and certain areas of Texas, is often identified by Americans as a "country" accent,[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-Hayes,_2013,_p._51-71) and is defined by the /aɪ/ vowel losing its [gliding quality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diphthong "Diphthong"): [aː], the initiation event for a complicated Southern vowel shift, including a "[Southern drawl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_drawl "Southern drawl")" that makes short [front vowels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_vowel "Front vowel") into distinct-sounding [gliding vowels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gliding_vowel "Gliding vowel").[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-FOOTNOTELabovAshBoberg2006125-72) The fronting of the vowels of GOOSE, GOAT, MOUTH, and STRUT tends to also define Southern accents as well as the accents spoken in the "[Midland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midland_American_English "Midland American English")": a vast band of the country that constitutes an intermediate dialect region between the traditional North and South. Western U.S. accents mostly fall under the General American spectrum.

Below, ten major American English accents are defined by their particular combinations of certain vowel sounds:

| Accent name | Most populous city | Strong /aʊ/ fronting | Strong /oʊ/ fronting | Strong /u/ fronting | Strong /ɑr/ fronting | [_Cot–caught_ merger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cot%E2%80%93caught_merger "Cot–caught merger") | [_Pin–pen_ merger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pin%E2%80%93pen_merger "Pin–pen merger") | [/æ/ raising system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki//%C3%A6/_tensing "/æ/ tensing") |

Although no longer region-specific,[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-FOOTNOTETrudgill200442-73)[African-American Vernacular English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_Vernacular_English "African-American Vernacular English"), which remains the native variety of most working- and middle-class [African Americans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans "African Americans"), has a close relationship to Southern dialects and has greatly influenced everyday speech of many Americans, including [hip hop culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_culture "Hip hop culture"). [Hispanic and Latino Americans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanic_and_Latino_Americans "Hispanic and Latino Americans") have also developed native-speaker varieties of English. The best-studied Latino Englishes are [Chicano English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicano_English "Chicano English"), spoken in the West and Midwest, and [New York Latino English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Latino_English "New York Latino English"), spoken in the [New York metropolitan area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_metropolitan_area "New York metropolitan area"). Additionally, ethnic varieties such as [Yeshiva English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeshivish "Yeshivish") and "[Yinglish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yinglish "Yinglish")" are spoken by some [American](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Jews "American Jews")[Orthodox Jews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodox_Jew "Orthodox Jew"), [Cajun Vernacular English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cajun_English "Cajun English") by some [Cajuns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cajun "Cajun") in southern [Louisiana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana "Louisiana"), and [Pennsylvania Dutch English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_Dutch_English "Pennsylvania Dutch English") by some [Pennsylvania Dutch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_Dutch "Pennsylvania Dutch") people. [American Indian Englishes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Indian_English "American Indian English") have been documented among diverse Indian tribes. The island state of [Hawaii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii "Hawaii"), though primarily English-speaking, is also home to a [creole language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creole_language "Creole language") known commonly as [Hawaiian Pidgin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaiian_Pidgin "Hawaiian Pidgin"), and some Hawaii residents speak English with a Pidgin-influenced accent. American English also gave rise to some dialects outside the country, for example, [Philippine English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine_English "Philippine English"), beginning during the [American occupation of the Philippines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Military_Government_of_the_Philippine_Islands "United States Military Government of the Philippine Islands") and subsequently the [Insular Government of the Philippine Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insular_Government_of_the_Philippine_Islands "Insular Government of the Philippine Islands"); [Thomasites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomasites "Thomasites") first established a variation of American English in these islands.[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-74)

In 2021, about 245 million Americans, aged 5 or above, spoke English at home: a majority of the United States total population of roughly 330 million people.[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-ACS2021-75)

Of the 50 states, 32 have adopted legislation granting official (or co-official) status to English within their jurisdictions, in some cases as part of what has been called the [English-only movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English-only_movement "English-only movement").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-WestVirginia-8)[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#cite_note-76) Typically only "English" is specified, not a particular variety like American English.
