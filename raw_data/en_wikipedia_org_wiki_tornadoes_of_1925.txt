100 Fatalities (U.S.) >805 Fatalities (worldwide) >806 1923 1924 1925 1926 1927 This page documents notable tornadoes and tornado outbreaks worldwide in 1925 . Strong and destructive tornadoes form most frequently in the United States , Argentina , Southern Brazil , the Bengal region and China , but can occur almost anywhere under the right conditions. Tornadoes also develop occasionally in southern Canada during summer in the Northern Hemisphere and somewhat regularly at other times of the year across Europe , South Africa , Japan , Australia and New Zealand . Tornadic events are often accompanied by other forms of severe weather , including thunderstorms , strong winds and hail .

1925 was the deadliest year for tornadoes in recorded history for North America, with over 800 fatalities being recorded. 695 deaths were from a single, long-tracked tornado that moved through Missouri , Illinois and Indiana .

[ 1 ] March 18–20 [ edit ] Main articles: 1925 tri-state tornado outbreak and 1925 tri-state tornado Destruction from the Tri-State tornado in Griffin, Indiana On March 18, one of the deadliest tornado outbreaks in recorded history generated at least 12 significant tornadoes and spanned a large portion of the midwestern and southern United States. The outbreak was one of the deadliest tornado outbreak in U.S. history. The outbreak generated several destructive tornadoes in Missouri , Illinois , and Indiana on the same day, as well as significant tornadoes in Alabama and Kansas .

[ 2 ] The outbreak included the "tri-state" tornado, the deadliest tornado in United States history and the second-deadliest registered in world history.

[ 3 ] The 219-mile-long (352 km) track left by the tornado, as it crossed from southeastern Missouri, through southern Illinois, and then into southwestern Indiana, is also the longest ever recorded.

[ 4 ] Modern meteorological re-analysis has suggested that the extremely long path length and lifespan reported in historical accounts are perhaps more plausibly attributed to multiple independent tornadoes belonging to a tornado family , rather than a single, continuous tornado.

[ 2 ] Although not officially rated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , the tri-state Tornado is recognized by most experts, such as Tom Grazulis and Ted Fujita , as an F5 tornado, [ 5 ] [ 6 ] the maximum damage rating that a tornado can attain on the Fujita scale .
