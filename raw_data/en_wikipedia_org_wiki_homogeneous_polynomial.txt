( July 2018 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) In mathematics , a homogeneous polynomial , sometimes called quantic in older texts, is a polynomial whose nonzero terms all have the same degree .

[ 1 ] For example, x 5 + 2 x 3 y 2 + 9 x y 4 {\displaystyle x^{5}+2x^{3}y^{2}+9xy^{4}} is a homogeneous polynomial of degree 5, in two variables; the sum of the exponents in each term is always 5. The polynomial x 3 + 3 x 2 y + z 7 {\displaystyle x^{3}+3x^{2}y+z^{7}} is not homogeneous, because the sum of exponents does not match from term to term. The function defined by a homogeneous polynomial is always a homogeneous function .

An algebraic form , or simply form , is a function defined by a homogeneous polynomial.

[ notes 1 ] A binary form is a form in two variables. A form is also a function defined on a vector space , which may be expressed as a homogeneous function of the coordinates over any basis .

A polynomial of degree 0 is always homogeneous; it is simply an element of the field or ring of the coefficients, usually called a constant or a scalar. A form of degree 1 is a linear form .

[ notes 2 ] A form of degree 2 is a quadratic form . In geometry , the Euclidean distance is the square root of a quadratic form.

Homogeneous polynomials are ubiquitous in mathematics and physics.

[ notes 3 ] They play a fundamental role in algebraic geometry , as a projective algebraic variety is defined as the set of  the common zeros of a set of homogeneous polynomials.

Properties [ edit ] A homogeneous polynomial defines a homogeneous function . This means that, if a multivariate polynomial P is homogeneous of degree d , then P ( λ λ x 1 , … … , λ λ x n ) = λ λ d P ( x 1 , … … , x n ) , {\displaystyle P(\lambda x_{1},\ldots ,\lambda x_{n})=\lambda ^{d}\,P(x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n})\,,} for every λ λ {\displaystyle \lambda } in any field containing the coefficients of P . Conversely, if the above relation is true for infinitely many λ λ {\displaystyle \lambda } then the polynomial is homogeneous of degree d .

In particular, if P is homogeneous then P ( x 1 , … … , x n ) = 0 ⇒ ⇒ P ( λ λ x 1 , … … , λ λ x n ) = 0 , {\displaystyle P(x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n})=0\quad \Rightarrow \quad P(\lambda x_{1},\ldots ,\lambda x_{n})=0,} for every λ λ .

{\displaystyle \lambda .} This property is fundamental in the definition of a projective variety .

Any nonzero polynomial may be decomposed, in a unique way, as a sum of homogeneous polynomials of different degrees, which are called the homogeneous components of the polynomial.

Given a polynomial ring R = K [ x 1 , … … , x n ] {\displaystyle R=K[x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n}]} over a field (or, more generally, a ring ) K , the homogeneous polynomials of degree d form a vector space (or a module ), commonly denoted R d .

{\displaystyle R_{d}.} The above unique decomposition means that R {\displaystyle R} is the direct sum of the R d {\displaystyle R_{d}} (sum over all nonnegative integers ).

The dimension of the vector space (or free module ) R d {\displaystyle R_{d}} is the number of different monomials of degree d in n variables (that is the maximal number of nonzero terms in a homogeneous polynomial of degree d in n variables). It is equal to the binomial coefficient ( d + n − − 1 n − − 1 ) = ( d + n − − 1 d ) = ( d + n − − 1 ) !

( n − − 1 ) !

.

{\displaystyle {\binom {d+n-1}{n-1}}={\binom {d+n-1}{d}}={\frac {(d+n-1)!}{d!(n-1)!}}.} Homogeneous polynomial satisfy Euler's identity for homogeneous functions . That is, if P is a homogeneous polynomial of degree d in the indeterminates x 1 , … … , x n , {\displaystyle x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n},} one has, whichever is the commutative ring of the coefficients, d P = ∑ ∑ i = 1 n x i ∂ ∂ P ∂ ∂ x i , {\displaystyle dP=\sum _{i=1}^{n}x_{i}{\frac {\partial P}{\partial x_{i}}},} where ∂ ∂ P ∂ ∂ x i {\displaystyle \textstyle {\frac {\partial P}{\partial x_{i}}}} denotes the formal partial derivative of P with respect to x i .

{\displaystyle x_{i}.} Homogenization [ edit ] A non-homogeneous polynomial P ( x 1 ,..., x n ) can be homogenized by introducing an additional variable x 0 and defining the homogeneous polynomial sometimes denoted h P : [ 2 ] h P ( x 0 , x 1 , … … , x n ) = x 0 d P ( x 1 x 0 , … … , x n x 0 ) , {\displaystyle {^{h}\!P}(x_{0},x_{1},\dots ,x_{n})=x_{0}^{d}P\left({\frac {x_{1}}{x_{0}}},\dots ,{\frac {x_{n}}{x_{0}}}\right),} where d is the degree of P . For example, if P ( x 1 , x 2 , x 3 ) = x 3 3 + x 1 x 2 + 7 , {\displaystyle P(x_{1},x_{2},x_{3})=x_{3}^{3}+x_{1}x_{2}+7,} then h P ( x 0 , x 1 , x 2 , x 3 ) = x 3 3 + x 0 x 1 x 2 + 7 x 0 3 .

{\displaystyle ^{h}\!P(x_{0},x_{1},x_{2},x_{3})=x_{3}^{3}+x_{0}x_{1}x_{2}+7x_{0}^{3}.} A homogenized polynomial can be dehomogenized by setting the additional variable x 0 = 1. That is P ( x 1 , … … , x n ) = h P ( 1 , x 1 , … … , x n ) .

{\displaystyle P(x_{1},\dots ,x_{n})={^{h}\!P}(1,x_{1},\dots ,x_{n}).} See also [ edit ] Multi-homogeneous polynomial Quasi-homogeneous polynomial Diagonal form Graded algebra Hilbert series and Hilbert polynomial Multilinear form Multilinear map Polarization of an algebraic form Schur polynomial Symbol of a differential operator Notes [ edit ] ^ However, as some authors do not make a clear distinction between a polynomial and its associated function, the terms homogeneous polynomial and form are sometimes considered as synonymous.

^ Linear forms are defined only for finite-dimensional vector space, and have thus to be distinguished from linear functionals , which are defined for every vector space. "Linear functional" is rarely used for finite-dimensional vector spaces.

^ Homogeneous polynomials in physics often appear as a consequence of dimensional analysis , where measured quantities must match in real-world problems.
