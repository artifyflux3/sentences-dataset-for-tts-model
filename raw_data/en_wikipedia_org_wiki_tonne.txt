For other uses, see Ton (disambiguation) , Tonne (disambiguation) , Megagram (geometry) , and Gigaton (album) .

Tonne Megagram A one-tonne (1000-kilogram) concrete block General information Unit system Non-SI Unit of mass Symbol t Mg In SI units : 1000 kg The tonne ( / t ʌ n / ⓘ or / t ɒ n / ; symbol: t ) is a unit of mass equal to 1,000 kilograms . It is a non-SI unit accepted for use with SI .

[ 1 ] It is also referred to as a metric ton in the United States to distinguish it from the non-metric units of the short ton ( United States customary units ) and the long ton ( British imperial units ). It is equivalent to approximately 2,204.6 pounds , 1.102 short tons, and 0.984 long tons. The official SI unit is the megagram ( Mg ), a less common way to express the same amount.

Symbol and abbreviations [ edit ] The BIPM symbol for the tonne is t, adopted at the same time as the unit in 1879.

[ 2 ] Its use is also official for the metric ton in the United States, having been adopted by the United States National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] It is a symbol, not an abbreviation, and should not be followed by a period . Use of lower case is significant, and use of other letter combinations can lead to ambiguity. For example, T, MT, mT,  are the SI symbols for the tesla , megatesla, and millitesla, respectively, while Mt and mt are SI-compatible symbols for the megatonne (one teragram) and millitonne (one kilogram). If describing TNT equivalent units of energy, one megatonne of TNT is equivalent to approximately 4.184 petajoules .

Origin and spelling [ edit ] In English, tonne is an established spelling alternative to metric ton .

[ 5 ] In American English and British English, tonne is usually pronounced the same as ton ( / t ʌ n / ), but the final "e" can also be pronounced, i.e. " tunnie " ( / ˈ t ʌ n i / ).

[ 6 ] In Australian English, the common and recommended pronunciation is / t ɒ n / .

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] In the United States, metric ton is the name for this unit used and recommended by NIST; [ 3 ] an unqualified mention of a ton typically refers to a short ton of 2,000 lb (907.2 kg) and to a lesser extent to a long ton of 2,240 lb (1,016 kg), with the term tonne rarely used in speech or writing. Both terms are acceptable in Canadian English .

Ton and tonne are both derived from a Germanic word in general use in the North Sea area since the Middle Ages ( cf.

Old English and Old Frisian tunne , Old High German and Medieval Latin tunna , German and French tonne ) to designate a large cask, or tun .

[ 9 ] A full tun, standing about a metre high, could easily weigh a tonne. See also the common German word Mülltonne ( lit.

' garbage drum ' ).

The spelling tonne pre-dates the introduction of the SI in 1960; it has been used with this meaning in France since 1842, [ 10 ] when there were no metric prefixes for multiples of 10 6 and above, and is now used as the standard spelling for the metric mass measurement in most English -speaking countries.

[ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] In the United States, the unit was originally referred to using the French words millier or tonneau , [ 15 ] but these terms are now obsolete.

[ 16 ] The British imperial and United States customary units are comparable to the tonne and the spelling of ton in English is the same, though they differ in mass.

French pre-metric tonne [ edit ] Prior to metrification the French tonne consisted of 2000 French pounds (livres). Therefore a French tonne of that era weighed 979 kg compared to an English ton of 1016 kg. Prior to the use of tonne for this weight tonneau (plural: tonneaux) was used.

[ 17 ] Conversions [ edit ] One tonne is equivalent to: 1000 kilograms (kg) by definition.

[ 18 ] 1 000 000 grams (g) or 1 megagram (Mg). Megagram is the corresponding official SI unit with the same mass; it is rarely used, in part because the base SI unit of mass is the kilogram, not the gram. Mg is distinct from mg, milligram.

⁠ 1000 / 0.453 592 37 ⁠ pounds (lb), by definition of the pound, [ 19 ] or approximately 2 204 .622 622 lb .

[ 20 ] ⁠ 1 / 0.907 184 74 ⁠ short tons (tn), exactly, or approximately 1.102 311 311 tn.

One short ton is exactly 0.907 184 74 t .

[ 21 ] ⁠ 1 / 1.016 046 9088 ⁠ long tons (LT), exactly, or approximately 0.984 206 5276 LT.

One long ton is exactly 1.016 046 9088 t .

[ 21 ] A tonne is the mass of one cubic metre of pure water at 4 °C (39 °F).

[ a ] Derived units [ edit ] As a non-SI unit, the use of SI metric prefixes with the tonne does not fall within the SI standard.  For multiples of the tonne, it is more usual to speak of thousands or millions of tonnes. Kilotonne, megatonne, and gigatonne are more usually used for the energy of nuclear explosions and other events in equivalent mass of TNT , often loosely as approximate figures.  When used in this context, there is little need to distinguish between metric and other tons, and the unit is spelled either as ton or tonne with the relevant prefix attached.

^ a b Values in the equivalent short and long tons columns are rounded to five significant figures . See Conversions for exact values.

^ Though non-standard, the symbol "kt" is also used (instead of the standard symbol "kn") for knot , a unit of speed for aircraft and watercraft . The standard meaning of the symbol kt is for kilotonne.

Alternative usages [ edit ] Metric ton units [ edit ] A metric ton unit (mtu) can mean 10 kg (22 lb) within metal trading, particularly within the United States. It traditionally referred to a metric ton of ore containing 1% (i.e. 10 kg) of metal.

[ 22 ] [ 23 ] The following excerpt from a mining geology textbook describes its usage in the particular case of tungsten: Tungsten concentrates are usually traded in metric tonne units (originally designating one tonne of ore containing 1% of WO 3 , today used to measure WO 3 quantities in 10 kg units. One metric tonne unit (mtu) of tungsten (VI) contains 7.93 kilograms of tungsten.

In the case of uranium , MTU is sometimes used in the sense of metric ton of uranium (1,000 kg [2,200 lb]).

[ 24 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ] Use of mass as proxy for energy [ edit ] Main articles: TNT equivalent and Tonne of oil equivalent The tonne of trinitrotoluene (TNT) is used as a proxy for energy, usually of explosions (TNT is a common high explosive ). Prefixes are used: kiloton(ne), megaton(ne), gigaton(ne), especially for expressing nuclear weapon yield , based on a specific combustion energy of TNT of about 4.2 MJ / kg (or one thermochemical calorie per milligram ).  Hence, 1 t TNT = approx.

4.2 GJ , 1 kt TNT = approx. 4.2 TJ , 1 Mt TNT = approx. 4.2 PJ .

The SI unit of energy is the joule . One tonne of TNT is approximately equivalent to 4.2 gigajoules.

In the petroleum industry , the tonne of oil equivalent (toe) is a unit of energy : the amount of energy released by burning one tonne of crude oil , approximately 42 GJ.  There are several slightly different definitions.  This is ten times as much as a tonne of TNT because atmospheric oxygen is used.

Unit of force [ edit ] Like the gram and the kilogram, the tonne gave rise to a (now obsolete) force unit of the same name, the tonne-force, equivalent to about 9.8 kilonewtons . The unit is also often called simply "tonne" or "metric ton" without identifying it as a unit of force. In contrast to the tonne as a mass unit, the tonne-force is not accepted for use with SI.

^ The Oxford English Dictionary 2nd ed. gives both megaton and megatonne and adds "The unit may be calculated in either imperial or metric tons; the form megatonne generally implies the metric unit". The use for energy is the first definition; use for mass or weight is the third definition.
