( October 2023 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Continuum limit in lattice models An animated example of a Brownian motion -like random walk on a torus . In the scaling limit, random walk approaches the Wiener process according to Donsker's theorem .

In mathematical physics and mathematics , the continuum limit or scaling limit of a lattice model characterizes its behaviour in the limit as the lattice spacing goes to zero. It is often useful to use lattice models to approximate real-world processes, such as Brownian motion . Indeed, according to Donsker's theorem , the discrete random walk would, in the scaling limit, approach the true Brownian motion .

Terminology [ edit ] The term continuum limit mostly finds use in the physical sciences, often in reference to models of aspects of quantum physics , while the term scaling limit is more common in mathematical use.

( December 2022 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) A lattice model that approximates a continuum quantum field theory in the limit as the lattice spacing goes to zero may correspond to finding a second order phase transition of the model. This is the scaling limit of the model.
