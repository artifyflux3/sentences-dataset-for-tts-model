Tangent measures (introduced by David Preiss [ 1 ] in his study of rectifiable sets ) are a  useful tool in geometric measure theory. For example, they are used in proving Marstrand's theorem and Preiss' theorem .

Definition [ edit ] Consider a Radon measure μ defined on an open subset Ω of n -dimensional Euclidean space R n and let a be an arbitrary point in Ω.  We can "zoom in" on a small open ball of radius r around a , B r ( a ), via the transformation T a , r ( x ) = x − − a r , {\displaystyle T_{a,r}(x)={\frac {x-a}{r}},} which enlarges the ball of radius r about a to a ball of radius 1 centered at 0.  With this, we may now zoom in on how μ behaves on B r ( a ) by looking at the push-forward measure defined by T a , r # # μ μ ( A ) = μ μ ( a + r A ) {\displaystyle T_{a,r\#}\mu (A)=\mu (a+rA)} where a + r A = { a + r x : x ∈ ∈ A } .

{\displaystyle a+rA=\{a+rx:x\in A\}.} As r gets smaller, this transformation on the measure μ spreads out and enlarges the portion of μ supported around the point a . We can get information about our measure around a by looking at what these measures tend to look like in the limit as r approaches zero.

Definition.

A tangent measure of a Radon measure μ at the point a is a second Radon measure ν such that there exist sequences of positive numbers c i > 0 and decreasing radii r i → 0 such that lim i → → ∞ ∞ c i T a , r i # # μ μ = ν ν {\displaystyle \lim _{i\rightarrow \infty }c_{i}T_{a,r_{i}\#}\mu =\nu } where the limit is taken in the weak-∗ topology , i.e., for any continuous function φ with compact support in Ω, lim i → → ∞ ∞ ∫ ∫ Ω Ω φ φ d ( c i T a , r i # # μ μ ) = ∫ ∫ Ω Ω φ φ d ν ν .

{\displaystyle \lim _{i\rightarrow \infty }\int _{\Omega }\varphi \,\mathrm {d} (c_{i}T_{a,r_{i}\#}\mu )=\int _{\Omega }\varphi \,\mathrm {d} \nu .} We denote the set of tangent measures of μ at a by Tan( μ , a ).

Existence [ edit ] The set Tan( μ , a ) of tangent measures of a measure μ at a point a in the support of μ is nonempty on mild conditions on μ . By the weak compactness of Radon measures, Tan( μ , a ) is nonempty if one of the following conditions hold: μ is asymptotically doubling at a , i.e.

lim sup r ↓ ↓ 0 μ μ ( B ( a , 2 r ) ) μ μ ( B ( a , r ) ) < ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle \limsup _{r\downarrow 0}{\frac {\mu (B(a,2r))}{\mu (B(a,r))}}<\infty } μ has positive and finite upper density , i.e.

0 < lim sup r ↓ ↓ 0 μ μ ( B ( a , r ) ) r s < ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle 0<\limsup _{r\downarrow 0}{\frac {\mu (B(a,r))}{r^{s}}}<\infty } for some 0 < s < ∞ ∞ {\displaystyle 0<s<\infty } .

Properties [ edit ] The collection of tangent measures at a point is closed under two types of scaling. Cones of measures were also defined by Preiss.

The set Tan( μ , a ) of tangent measures of a measure μ at a point a in the support of μ is a cone of measures, i.e. if ν ν ∈ ∈ T a n ( μ μ , a ) {\displaystyle \nu \in \mathrm {Tan} (\mu ,a)} and c > 0 {\displaystyle c>0} , then c ν ν ∈ ∈ T a n ( μ μ , a ) {\displaystyle c\nu \in \mathrm {Tan} (\mu ,a)} .

The cone Tan( μ , a ) of tangent measures of a measure μ at a point a in the support of μ is a d-cone or dilation invariant , i.e. if ν ν ∈ ∈ T a n ( μ μ , a ) {\displaystyle \nu \in \mathrm {Tan} (\mu ,a)} and r > 0 {\displaystyle r>0} , then T 0 , r # # ν ν ∈ ∈ T a n ( μ μ , a ) {\displaystyle T_{0,r\#}\nu \in \mathrm {Tan} (\mu ,a)} .

At typical points in the support of a measure, the cone of tangent measures is also closed under translations.

At μ almost every a in the support of μ , the cone Tan( μ , a ) of tangent measures of μ at a is translation invariant , i.e. if ν ν ∈ ∈ T a n ( μ μ , a ) {\displaystyle \nu \in \mathrm {Tan} (\mu ,a)} and x is in the support of ν , then T x , 1 # # ν ν ∈ ∈ T a n ( μ μ , a ) {\displaystyle T_{x,1\#}\nu \in \mathrm {Tan} (\mu ,a)} .

Examples [ edit ] Suppose we have a circle in R 2 with uniform measure on that circle. Then, for any point a in the circle, the set of tangent measures will just be positive constants times 1-dimensional Hausdorff measure supported on the line tangent to the circle at that point.

In 1995, Toby O'Neil produced an example of a Radon measure μ on R d such that, for μ-almost every point a ∈ R d , Tan( μ , a ) consists of all nonzero Radon measures.

[ 2 ] Related concepts [ edit ] There is an associated notion of the tangent space of a measure.  A k -dimensional subspace P of R n is called the k -dimensional tangent space of μ at a ∈ Ω if — after appropriate rescaling — μ "looks like" k -dimensional Hausdorff measure H k on P .  More precisely: Definition.

P is the k - dimensional tangent space of μ at a if there is a θ > 0 such that μ μ a , r → r → → 0 ∗ ∗ θ θ H k ⌊ ⌊ P , {\displaystyle \mu _{a,r}{\xrightarrow[{r\to 0}]{*}}\theta H^{k}\lfloor _{P},} where μ a , r is the translated and rescaled measure given by μ μ a , r ( A ) = 1 r n − − 1 μ μ ( a + r A ) .

{\displaystyle \mu _{a,r}(A)={\frac {1}{r^{n-1}}}\mu (a+rA).} The number θ is called the multiplicity of μ at a , and the tangent space of μ at a is denoted T a ( μ ).

Further study of tangent measures and tangent spaces leads to the notion of a varifold .
