( March 2025 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) A cultural universal (also called an anthropological universal or human universal ) is an element, pattern, trait, or institution that is common to all known human cultures worldwide. Taken together, the whole body of cultural universals is known as the human condition .

Evolutionary psychologists hold that behaviors or traits that occur universally in all cultures are good candidates for evolutionary adaptations.

[ 1 ] Some anthropological and sociological theorists that take a cultural relativist perspective may deny the existence of cultural universals: the extent to which these universals are "cultural" in the narrow sense, or in fact biologically inherited behavior is an issue of " nature versus nurture ". Prominent scholars on the topic include Emile Durkheim , George Murdock , Claude Lévi-Strauss , and Donald Brown .

Donald Brown's list in Human Universals [ edit ] In his book Human Universals (1991), Donald Brown defines human universals as comprising "those features of culture, society, language, behavior, and psyche for which there are no known exception", providing a list of hundreds of items he suggests as universal. Among the cultural universals listed by Donald Brown are: [ 2 ] Language and cognition [ edit ] Main article: Linguistic universal Language is translatable Abstraction in speech and thought Antonyms , synonyms Logical notions of "and", "not", "opposite", "equivalent", "part/whole", "general/particular" Binary cognitive distinctions Color terms : black, white Classification of: age, behavioral propensities, body parts,  colors, fauna, flora, inner states, kin, gender, space, tools, weather conditions Continua (ordering as cognitive pattern) Discrepancies between speech, thought, and action Figurative speech , metaphors Symbolism, symbolic speech Synesthetic metaphors Tabooed utterances Special speech for special occasions Prestige from proficient use of language (e.g. poetry) Planning Units of time Language employed to manipulate, misinform, or mislead Society [ edit ] Personal names Family or household Kin groups Peer groups not based on family Actions under self-control distinguished from those not under control Affection expressed and felt Age grades, statuses, and terms Law : rights and obligations, rules of membership Moral sentiments Distinguishing right and wrong, good and bad Promise/oath Prestige inequalities Statuses and roles [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Leaders Inclination towards patriarchy (dominance of men in society) De facto oligarchy Property Coalitions Collective identities Conflict Cooperative labor Gender roles Males on average travel greater distances over lifetime Marriage Husband older than wife on average Copulation normally conducted in privacy Incest prevention or avoidance, incest between mother and son unthinkable Collective decision making Etiquette Inheritance rules Generosity admired, gift giving Mood- or consciousness-altering techniques and/or substances Redress of wrongs, sanctions Sexual jealousy Sexual violence Shame Territoriality Triangular awareness (assessing relationships among the self and two other people) Some forms of proscribed violence Visiting Trade Beliefs [ edit ] Further information: Myth and ritual Magical thinking Use of magic to increase life and win love Beliefs about death Beliefs about disease Beliefs about fortune and misfortune Divination Attempts to control weather Dream interpretation Beliefs and narratives Proverbs , sayings Poetry/ rhetorics Healing practices, medicine Childbirth customs Rites of passage Music , rhythm , dance , and to some degree associations between music and emotion Play Toys, playthings Death rituals, mourning Feasting Body adornment Hairstyles Art Technology [ edit ] Shelter Control of fire Tools , tool making Weapons , spear Containers Cooking Lever Rope Nicholas Christakis' innate social universals [ edit ] Based on experiments and studies of accidental and utopian societies, sociologist and evolutionary biologist Nicholas Christakis proposes that humans have evolved to genetically favor societies that have eight universal attributes, including: [ 5 ] Love for romantic partners Love for offspring Friendship Social networks Cooperation In-group favoritism Non-nativist explanations [ edit ] The observation of the same or similar behavior in different cultures does not prove that they are the results of a common underlying psychological mechanism. One possibility is that they may have been invented independently due to a common practical problem.

[ 6 ] Outside influence could be an explanation for some cultural universals.

[ 7 ] This does not preclude multiple independent inventions of civilization and is therefore not the same thing as hyperdiffusionism ; it merely means that cultural universals are not proof of innateness .
