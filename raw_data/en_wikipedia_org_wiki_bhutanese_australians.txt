History [ edit ] Beginning in the 1960s, a number of Bhutanese officials came to Australia to receive education or training under the Colombo Plan .

[ 2 ] Since the re-opening of Australian borders after the COVID-19 pandemic, over 12,000 Bhutanese have immigrated to Australia. These immigrants have enrolled themselves in hospitality fields such as childcare.

[ 3 ] [ 4 ] Bhutan has experienced a brain drain due to the exodus of young professionals and students from the country.

[ 5 ] Demographics [ edit ] Perth has the largest Bhutanese population in Australia. As of 2022 [update] , Bhutan was the most common non-Australian country of birth for residents in the adjoining Perth suburbs of Osborne Park , Glendalough , and Wembley , with around 21 percent of Glendalough residents born in Bhutan.
