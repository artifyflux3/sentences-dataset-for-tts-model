The logistics and difficulties inherent in such ventures have been heavily explored in science fiction .

Outposts by environment [ edit ] Polar [ edit ] Further information: List of research stations in the Arctic , List of northernmost settlements , and Research stations in Antarctica Polar research stations have been built and advanced by many states and for many purposes. For more see the articles about research stations in Antarctica and Arctic drifting ice stations .

Under sea [ edit ] NASA trains astronauts in an underwater habitat , to simulate living and working in the International Space Station . They conduct scientific research on the human body and coral reefs, and build undersea structures to simulate space station assembly spacewalk tasks. The program is also being used to study how isolation affects human behaviour, to prepare for the first human outposts on the Moon and Mars.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] Outer space [ edit ] See also: Human presence in space , Human spaceflight , Space station , Bioastronautics , and Lunar lava tube The Salyut 1 space station in low Earth orbit was the first human outpost in space.  The International Space Station and Tiangong space station are the two functional human outposts in space, after China de-orbited its Tiangong-2 in 2019.

NanoRacks , after finalizing its contract with NASA, and after winning NextSTEPs Phase II award, is now developing its concept Independence-1 (previously known as Ixion), the first 'outpost' in NanoRacks' Space Outpost Program, which would turn spent rocket tanks into a habitable living area, often known as a wet workshop .

Planning and design for Lunar [ 2 ] [ 8 ] and Martian outposts is underway.

[ 4 ] In fiction [ edit ] Human outposts in other worlds are a common motif in science fiction, whether established and occupied solely by humans or in cooperation – or competition – with alien species .  The setting may be another planet, Earth-like or otherwise; or a spaceship large enough to house a city.
