Ordered geometry is a fundamental geometry forming a common framework for affine , Euclidean , absolute , and hyperbolic geometry (but not for projective geometry).

History [ edit ] Moritz Pasch first defined a geometry without reference to measurement in 1882.  His axioms were improved upon by Peano (1889), Hilbert (1899), and Veblen (1904).

[ 1 ] : 176 Euclid anticipated Pasch's approach in definition 4 of The Elements :  "a straight line is a line which lies evenly with the points on itself".

[ 2 ] Primitive concepts [ edit ] The only primitive notions in ordered geometry are points A , B , C , ... and the ternary relation of intermediacy [ ABC ] which can be read as " B is between A and C ".

Definitions [ edit ] The segment AB is the set of points P such that [ APB ].

The interval AB is the segment AB and its end points A and B .

The ray A / B (read as "the ray from A away from B ") is the set of points P such that [ PAB ].

The line AB is the interval AB and the two rays A / B and B / A .  Points on the line AB are said to be collinear .

An angle consists of a point O (the vertex ) and two non-collinear rays out from O (the sides ).

A triangle is given by three non-collinear points (called vertices ) and their three segments AB , BC , and CA .

If three points A , B , and C are non-collinear, then a plane ABC is the set of all points collinear with pairs of points on one or two of the sides of triangle ABC .

If four points A , B , C , and D are non-coplanar, then a space ( 3-space ) ABCD is the set of all points collinear with pairs of points selected from any of the four faces (planar regions) of the tetrahedron ABCD .

Axioms of ordered geometry [ edit ] There exist at least two points.

If A and B are distinct points, there exists a C such that [ABC].

If [ ABC ], then A and C are distinct ( A ≠ C ).

If [ ABC ], then [ CBA ] but not [ CAB ].

If C and D are distinct points on the line AB , then A is on the line CD .

If AB is a line, there is a point C not on the line AB .

( Axiom of Pasch ) If ABC is a triangle and [ BCD ] and [ CEA ], then there exists a point F on the line DE for which [ AFB ].

Axiom of dimensionality : For planar ordered geometry, all points are in one plane.  Or If ABC is a plane, then there exists a point D not in the plane ABC .

All points are in the same plane, space, etc. (depending on the dimension one chooses to work within).

(Dedekind's Axiom) For every partition of all the points on a line into two nonempty sets such that no point of either lies between two points of the other, there is a point of one set  which lies between every other point of that set  and every point of the other set.

These axioms are closely related to Hilbert's axioms of order . For a comprehensive survey of axiomatizations of ordered geometry see Pambuccian (2011).

[ 3 ] Results [ edit ] Sylvester's problem of collinear points [ edit ] The Sylvester–Gallai theorem can be proven within ordered geometry.

[ 4 ] [ 1 ] : 181, 2 Parallelism [ edit ] Gauss , Bolyai , and Lobachevsky developed a notion of parallelism which can be expressed in ordered geometry.

[ 1 ] : 189, 90 Theorem (existence of parallelism): Given a point A and a line r , not through A , there exist exactly two limiting rays from A in the plane Ar which do not meet r .  So there is a parallel line through A which does not meet r .

Theorem (transmissibility of parallelism): The parallelism of a ray and a line is preserved by adding or subtracting a segment from the beginning of a ray.

The transitivity of parallelism cannot be proven in ordered geometry.

[ 5 ] Therefore, the "ordered" concept of parallelism does not form an equivalence relation on lines.
