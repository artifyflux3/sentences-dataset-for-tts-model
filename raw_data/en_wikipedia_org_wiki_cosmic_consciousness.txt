[ 1 ] Synopsis [ edit ] In Cosmic Consciousness , Bucke stated that he discerned three forms, or degrees, of consciousness: [ 2 ] simple consciousness, possessed by both animals and mankind; Self-consciousness , possessed by mankind, encompassing thought, reason, and imagination, and Cosmic consciousness, which is "a higher form of consciousness than that possessed by the ordinary man" [ 1 ] According to Bucke, "This consciousness shows the cosmos to consist not of dead matter governed by unconscious, rigid, and unintending law; it shows it on the contrary as entirely immaterial, entirely spiritual and entirely alive; it shows that death is an absurdity, that everyone and everything has eternal life; it shows that the universe is God and that God is the universe, and that no evil ever did or ever will enter into it; a great deal of this is, of course, from the point of view of self consciousness, absurd; it is nevertheless undoubtedly true." [ 3 ] Reception [ edit ] Moores said that Bucke's cosmic consciousness is an interconnected way of seeing things "which is more of an intuitive knowing than it is a factual understanding".

[ 4 ] Moores pointed out that, for scholars of the purist camp, the experience of cosmic consciousness is incomplete without the element of love, "which is the foundation of mystical consciousness".

[ 4 ] Juan A. Herrero Brasas said that Bucke's cosmic consciousness refers to the evolution of the intellect, and not to "the ineffable revelation of hidden truths".

[ 5 ] According to Brasas, it was William James who equated Bucke's cosmic consciousness with mystical experience or mystical consciousness.

[ 5 ] Gary Lachman notes that today Bucke's experience would most likely be explained by the " God spot ", or more generally as a case of temporal lobe epilepsy , but he is skeptical of these and other organic explanations.

[ 6 ] Similar concepts [ edit ] According to Michael Robertson, Cosmic Consciousness and William James 's 1902 book The Varieties of Religious Experience have much in common: [ 7 ] "Both Bucke and James argue that all religions, no matter how seemingly different, have a common core ; both believe that it is possible to identify this core by stripping away institutional accretions of dogma and ritual and focusing on individual experience; and both identify mystical illumination as the foundation of all religious experience." [ 7 ] James popularized the concept of religious experience , [ note 1 ] which he explored in his 1902 book The Varieties of Religious Experience .

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] He saw mysticism as a distinctive experience which supplies knowledge of the transcendental.

[ 11 ] He considered the "personal religion" [ 12 ] to be "more fundamental than either theology or ecclesiasticism".
