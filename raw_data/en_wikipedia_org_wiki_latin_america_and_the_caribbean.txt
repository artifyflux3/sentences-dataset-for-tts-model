[ 3 ] Culture [ edit ] Religion [ edit ] See also: Religion in Latin America and Religion in the Caribbean Most countries are dominated by Christianity , the largest being Roman Catholicism . Smaller groups include Protestantism (including Mormonism and Jehovah's Witnesses ) and Orthodoxy and other forms of Christianity. There are many venerated folk saints and folk religions namely folk catholicism as well as african diaspora religions ( syncretic african traditional religions ) as well as Native American religions including shamanism . Many folk healers also practice folk magic. Specific Creole peoples often have their own religions/spiritual practices like the Maroons 's Rastafari and Garifuna 's belief system (or New Orleans Voodoo and Melungeon in North America).

[ citation needed ] Especially in the Caribbean, Central America and Brasil, there are Jewish (including Messianic Jews ), Muslim , Hindu , Baháʼí Faith (especially in Panama, Bolivia and Belize), Buddhist , Shinto and Romani mythology , Chinese folk religion , Dravidian folk religion (among others) practitioners. The Muslims and especially Jews and Gitanos are often descendants of the peoples forced into Crypto-Judaism and Crypto-Islam (and even Crypto-Paganism , for lack of a better term) from the Reconquista . There most likely is Sikh and Jainist groups (and possibly even smaller Zoroastrianism , Samaritan and Druze groups). There is also a growing movement of unitarian universalism / new age / neo-paganism -type unorganized spirituality; goddess worship is especially popular with younger, often progressive people like feminists. Again, these movements are often also syncretic, such as Pachamama or other Pre-Columbian Deity worship. Atheism/Agnosticism is quite dichotomous with a few countries having high percentages, but most are small and may be growing slowly.
