[ 6 ] In 1985–1994 Dauben served as the chair of the Executive Committee of the International Commission on the History of Mathematics .

[ 7 ] Dauben delivered an invited lecture at the 1998 International Congress of Mathematicians in Berlin on Karl Marx's mathematical work .

[ 8 ] The creator of non-standard analysis , Abraham Robinson was the subject of Dauben's 1995 book Abraham Robinson . It was reviewed positively by Moshé Machover , but the review noted that it avoids discussing any of Robinson's negative aspects, and "in this respect [the book] borders on the hagiographic, painting a portrait without warts." [ 9 ] In 2002 Dauben became an honorary member of the Institute for History of Natural Science of the Chinese Academy of Sciences .
