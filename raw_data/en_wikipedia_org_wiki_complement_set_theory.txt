In set theory , the complement of a set A , often denoted by A c {\displaystyle A^{c}} (or A ′ ), [ 1 ] is the set of elements not in A .

[ 2 ] When all elements in the universe , i.e. all elements under consideration, are considered to be members of a given set U , the absolute complement of A is the set of elements in U that are not in A .

The relative complement of A with respect to a set B , also termed the set difference of B and A , written B ∖ ∖ A , {\displaystyle B\setminus A,} is the set of elements in B that are not in A .

Absolute complement [ edit ] The absolute complement of the white disc is the red region Definition [ edit ] If A is a set, then the absolute complement of A (or simply the complement of A ) is the set of elements not in A (within a larger set that is implicitly defined). In other words, let U be a set that contains all the elements under study; if there is no need to mention U , either because it has been previously specified, or it is obvious and unique, then the absolute complement of A is the relative complement of A in U : [ 3 ] A c = U ∖ ∖ A = { x ∈ ∈ U : x ∉ ∉ A } .

{\displaystyle A^{c}=U\setminus A=\{x\in U:x\notin A\}.} The absolute complement of A is usually denoted by A c {\displaystyle A^{c}} . Other notations include A ¯ ¯ , A ′ , {\displaystyle {\overline {A}},A',} [ 2 ] ∁ ∁ U A , and ∁ ∁ A .

{\displaystyle \complement _{U}A,{\text{ and }}\complement A.} [ 4 ] Examples [ edit ] Assume that the universe is the set of integers . If A is the set of odd numbers, then the complement of A is the set of even numbers. If B is the set of multiples of 3, then the complement of B is the set of numbers congruent to 1 or 2 modulo 3 (or, in simpler terms, the integers that are not multiples of 3).

Assume that the universe is the standard 52-card deck . If the set A is the suit of spades, then the complement of A is the union of the suits of clubs, diamonds, and hearts. If the set B is the union of the suits of clubs and diamonds, then the complement of B is the union of the suits of hearts and spades.

When the universe is the universe of sets described in formalized set theory , the absolute complement of a set is generally not itself a set, but rather a proper class .  For more info, see universal set .

Properties [ edit ] Let A and B be two sets in a universe U . The following identities capture important properties of absolute complements: De Morgan's laws : [ 5 ] ( A ∪ ∪ B ) c = A c ∩ ∩ B c .

{\displaystyle \left(A\cup B\right)^{c}=A^{c}\cap B^{c}.} ( A ∩ ∩ B ) c = A c ∪ ∪ B c .

{\displaystyle \left(A\cap B\right)^{c}=A^{c}\cup B^{c}.} Complement laws: [ 5 ] A ∪ ∪ A c = U .

{\displaystyle A\cup A^{c}=U.} A ∩ ∩ A c = ∅ ∅ .

{\displaystyle A\cap A^{c}=\emptyset .} ∅ ∅ c = U .

{\displaystyle \emptyset ^{c}=U.} U c = ∅ ∅ .

{\displaystyle U^{c}=\emptyset .} If A ⊆ ⊆ B , then B c ⊆ ⊆ A c .

{\displaystyle {\text{If }}A\subseteq B{\text{, then }}B^{c}\subseteq A^{c}.} (this follows from the equivalence of a conditional with its contrapositive ).

Involution or double complement law: ( A c ) c = A .

{\displaystyle \left(A^{c}\right)^{c}=A.} Relationships between relative and absolute complements: A ∖ ∖ B = A ∩ ∩ B c .

{\displaystyle A\setminus B=A\cap B^{c}.} ( A ∖ ∖ B ) c = A c ∪ ∪ B = A c ∪ ∪ ( B ∩ ∩ A ) .

{\displaystyle (A\setminus B)^{c}=A^{c}\cup B=A^{c}\cup (B\cap A).} Relationship with a set difference: A c ∖ ∖ B c = B ∖ ∖ A .

{\displaystyle A^{c}\setminus B^{c}=B\setminus A.} The first two complement laws above show that if A is a non-empty, proper subset of U , then { A , A ∁ } is a partition of U .

Relative complement [ edit ] Definition [ edit ] If A and B are sets, then the relative complement of A in B , [ 5 ] also termed the set difference of B and A , [ 6 ] is the set of elements in B but not in A .

The relative complement of A in B : B ∩ ∩ A c = B ∖ ∖ A {\displaystyle B\cap A^{c}=B\setminus A} The relative complement of A in B is denoted B ∖ ∖ A {\displaystyle B\setminus A} according to the ISO 31-11 standard . It is sometimes written B − − A , {\displaystyle B-A,} but this notation is ambiguous, as in some contexts (for example, Minkowski set operations in functional analysis ) it can be interpreted as the set of all elements b − − a , {\displaystyle b-a,} where b is taken from B and a from A .

Formally: B ∖ ∖ A = { x ∈ ∈ B : x ∉ ∉ A } .

{\displaystyle B\setminus A=\{x\in B:x\notin A\}.} Examples [ edit ] { 1 , 2 , 3 } ∖ ∖ { 2 , 3 , 4 } = { 1 } .

{\displaystyle \{1,2,3\}\setminus \{2,3,4\}=\{1\}.} { 2 , 3 , 4 } ∖ ∖ { 1 , 2 , 3 } = { 4 } .

{\displaystyle \{2,3,4\}\setminus \{1,2,3\}=\{4\}.} If R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } is the set of real numbers and Q {\displaystyle \mathbb {Q} } is the set of rational numbers , then R ∖ ∖ Q {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} \setminus \mathbb {Q} } is the set of irrational numbers .

Properties [ edit ] See also: List of set identities and relations and Algebra of sets Let A , B , and C be three sets in a universe U . The following identities capture notable properties of relative complements: C ∖ ∖ ( A ∩ ∩ B ) = ( C ∖ ∖ A ) ∪ ∪ ( C ∖ ∖ B ) .

{\displaystyle C\setminus (A\cap B)=(C\setminus A)\cup (C\setminus B).} C ∖ ∖ ( A ∪ ∪ B ) = ( C ∖ ∖ A ) ∩ ∩ ( C ∖ ∖ B ) .

{\displaystyle C\setminus (A\cup B)=(C\setminus A)\cap (C\setminus B).} C ∖ ∖ ( B ∖ ∖ A ) = ( C ∩ ∩ A ) ∪ ∪ ( C ∖ ∖ B ) , {\displaystyle C\setminus (B\setminus A)=(C\cap A)\cup (C\setminus B),} with the important special case C ∖ ∖ ( C ∖ ∖ A ) = ( C ∩ ∩ A ) {\displaystyle C\setminus (C\setminus A)=(C\cap A)} demonstrating that intersection can be expressed using only the relative complement operation.

( B ∖ ∖ A ) ∩ ∩ C = ( B ∩ ∩ C ) ∖ ∖ A = B ∩ ∩ ( C ∖ ∖ A ) .

{\displaystyle (B\setminus A)\cap C=(B\cap C)\setminus A=B\cap (C\setminus A).} ( B ∖ ∖ A ) ∪ ∪ C = ( B ∪ ∪ C ) ∖ ∖ ( A ∖ ∖ C ) .

{\displaystyle (B\setminus A)\cup C=(B\cup C)\setminus (A\setminus C).} A ∖ ∖ A = ∅ ∅ .

{\displaystyle A\setminus A=\emptyset .} ∅ ∅ ∖ ∖ A = ∅ ∅ .

{\displaystyle \emptyset \setminus A=\emptyset .} A ∖ ∖ ∅ ∅ = A .

{\displaystyle A\setminus \emptyset =A.} A ∖ ∖ U = ∅ ∅ .

{\displaystyle A\setminus U=\emptyset .} If A ⊂ ⊂ B {\displaystyle A\subset B} , then C ∖ ∖ A ⊃ ⊃ C ∖ ∖ B {\displaystyle C\setminus A\supset C\setminus B} .

A ⊇ ⊇ B ∖ ∖ C {\displaystyle A\supseteq B\setminus C} is equivalent to C ⊇ ⊇ B ∖ ∖ A {\displaystyle C\supseteq B\setminus A} .

Complementary relation [ edit ] A binary relation R {\displaystyle R} is defined as a subset of a product of sets X × × Y .

{\displaystyle X\times Y.} The complementary relation R ¯ ¯ {\displaystyle {\bar {R}}} is the set complement of R {\displaystyle R} in X × × Y .

{\displaystyle X\times Y.} The complement of relation R {\displaystyle R} can be written R ¯ ¯ = ( X × × Y ) ∖ ∖ R .

{\displaystyle {\bar {R}}\ =\ (X\times Y)\setminus R.} Here, R {\displaystyle R} is often viewed as a logical matrix with rows representing the elements of X , {\displaystyle X,} and columns elements of Y .

{\displaystyle Y.} The truth of a R b {\displaystyle aRb} corresponds to 1 in row a , {\displaystyle a,} column b .

{\displaystyle b.} Producing the complementary relation to R {\displaystyle R} then corresponds to switching all 1s to 0s, and 0s to 1s for the logical matrix of the complement.

Together with composition of relations and converse relations , complementary relations and the algebra of sets are the elementary operations of the calculus of relations .

LaTeX notation [ edit ] See also: List of mathematical symbols by subject In the LaTeX typesetting language, the command \setminus [ 7 ] is usually used for rendering a set difference symbol, which is similar to a backslash symbol. When rendered, the \setminus command looks identical to \backslash , except that it has a little more space in front and behind the slash, akin to the LaTeX sequence \mathbin{\backslash} . A variant \smallsetminus is available in the amssymb package, but this symbol is not included separately in Unicode. The symbol ∁ ∁ {\displaystyle \complement } (as opposed to C {\displaystyle C} ) is produced by \complement . (It corresponds to the Unicode symbol U+2201 ∁ COMPLEMENT .)
