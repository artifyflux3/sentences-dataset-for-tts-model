Alcmaeon dedicated his works to Brontinus as well as to Leon and Bathyllus .

[ 1 ] Accounts vary as to whether he was the father or the husband of Theano .

[ 2 ] Some Orphic poems were ascribed to Brontinus. One was a poem On Nature ( Physika ), [ 3 ] another was a poem called The Robe and the Net [ 3 ] that was also ascribed to Zopyrus of Heraclea .

[ 4 ] His fame was sufficient for a spurious work to be ascribed to him in the Neopythagorean literature.

Syrianus (5th century CE) refers to "Brotinus" [ 5 ] as an author of the view that the monad , or first cause , "transcends all kinds of reason and essence in power and dignity," [ 6 ] whereby an attempt was made to insert an element of Platonism into Pythagoreanism , [ 7 ] which probably refers to Neoplatonism .
