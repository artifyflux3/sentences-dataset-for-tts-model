[ 1 ] Life [ edit ] Born in Liverpool , Haywood lived there for most of his life. In 1828 (describing himself as a 'layman of the Church of England', though he was in fact active in Liverpool Unitarian circles) he translated a reply by the theological rationalist Karl Gottlieb Bretschneider to Hugh James Rose 's essay on the state of Protestantism in Germany.

[ 1 ] In an 1829 Foreign Review article Haywood called for an English translation of Kant's Critique of Pure Reason .

Arthur Schopenhauer wrote to him on the matter, but was offended when Haywood suggested they should collaborate on a translation.

[ 2 ] Haywood's translation of the first Critique appeared anonymously in 1838.

[ 1 ] Haywood died on 29 May 1858 at Feckenham in Worcestershire , and was buried in the churchyard of St John the Baptist in Feckenham.

[ 2 ] Haywood's daughter Lucy Franklin published an anonymous memoir of her father in the Cornhill Magazine .

[ 3 ] There are some papers relating to him at Duke University library.
