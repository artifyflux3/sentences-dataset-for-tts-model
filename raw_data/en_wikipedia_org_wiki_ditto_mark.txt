The **ditto mark** is a shorthand [sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign "Sign"), used mostly in hand-written text, indicating that the words or figures above it are to be repeated.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ditto_mark#cite_note-OED-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ditto_mark#cite_note-Collins-2)

The mark is made using "a pair of [apostrophes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe "Apostrophe")";[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ditto_mark#cite_note-OED-1) "a pair of marks " used underneath a word";[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ditto_mark#cite_note-3) the symbol " ([quotation mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark "Quotation mark"));[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ditto_mark#cite_note-Collins-2)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ditto_mark#cite_note-Cam-4) or the symbol ‚Äù (right double quotation mark).[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ditto_mark#cite_note-5)

In the following example, the second line reads "Blue pens, box of twenty".

Black pens, box of twenty ... $2.10
Blue  "     "   "  "      ... $2.35

Ditto marks date to cuneiform tablets.

Early evidence of ditto marks can be seen on a cuneiform tablet of the [Neo-Assyrian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Assyrian "Neo-Assyrian") period (934‚Äì608 BCE) where two vertical marks are used in a table of synonyms to repeat text.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ditto_mark#cite_note-6)

The word _ditto_ comes from the [Tuscan language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuscan_language "Tuscan language"),[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ditto_mark#cite_note-tfd-7) where it is the past participle of the verb _dire_ (to say), with the meaning of "said", as in the [locution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figure_of_speech "Figure of speech") "the said story". The first recorded use of _ditto_ with this meaning in English occurs in 1625.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ditto_mark#cite_note-tfd-7)

In English, the abbreviation "_**do.**_", usually italicised, has sometimes been used instead of ditto marks - see example below, and also in a table in a U.S. Patent.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ditto_mark#cite_note-8)

An advertisement from 1833. The second item on the list can be read as "Prime American Pork, in barrels", but the third and fourth are ambiguous as to the origin of the meat. The repetition indicator used is "do."([Perth Gazette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth_Gazette "Perth Gazette"))

Bronzeware script, c. 825 BCE, showing "Â≠ê †Ñ† Â≠´ †Ñ† ÂØ∂Áî®", where the small †Ñ† ("two") is used as iteration marks in the phrase "Â≠êÂ≠êÂ≠´Â≠´ÂØ∂Áî®" ("descendants to use and to treasure").

Other languages may use equivalent symbols. For example, in Norwegian and Swedish handwriting, a version using horizontal lines to indicate the span of the cell in a table where an entry repeats is sometimes seen (‚Äì‚Äì„ÄÉ‚Äì‚Äì).[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ditto_mark#cite_note-9) In French, it is called a _[guillemet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillemet "Guillemet") it√©ratif_, but the actual symbol used may vary: ¬ª is used in Quebec, while in France ‚Äî is preferred.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ditto_mark#cite_note-10) For Chinese, Japanese and Korean, there is the specific [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode "Unicode") character U+3003„ÄÉDITTO MARK in the range [CJK Symbols and Punctuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJK_Symbols_and_Punctuation "CJK Symbols and Punctuation"). This facilitates the setting of both marks on a single horizontal line in Asian vertical text.

In China the corresponding historical mark was two horizontal lines †Ñ† (Unicode U+16FE3 ñø£ OLD CHINESE ITERATION MARK), which is also the ancient ideograph of "two", similar to the modern ideograph ‰∫å. It is found in [bronze script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_script "Bronze script") from the [Zhou dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhou_dynasty "Zhou dynasty"), as in the example at right (c. 825 BCE). In [seal script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seal_script "Seal script") form this became „Äª, and is now written as „ÄÖ; see [iteration mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iteration_mark "Iteration mark").

[![Image 4: The word "kakaw" (Mayan for "cacao") written in the Maya script.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Kakaw_%28Mayan_word%29.png/250px-Kakaw_%28Mayan_word%29.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Kakaw_(Mayan_word).png)

The word _kakaw_ (Mayan for [cacao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocoa_bean "Cocoa bean")) written in the [Maya script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_script "Maya script"). The two dots near the fish's mouth indicate its _ka_ sound is meant to be read twice.

In the [Maya script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_script "Maya script"), a pair of small dots may appear above or in front of a glyph to indicate that it should be read twice. This duplication [diacritic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic "Diacritic") functions as a phonetic doubling device, typically applied to syllabic signs. For example, the Maya word _kakaw_ ("[cacao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocoa_bean "Cocoa bean")") can be written with a _ka_ sign marked by two small prefixed dots, signaling that it be read as _ka-ka_, followed by _wa_.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ditto_mark#cite_note-11)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ditto_mark#cite_note-12)
