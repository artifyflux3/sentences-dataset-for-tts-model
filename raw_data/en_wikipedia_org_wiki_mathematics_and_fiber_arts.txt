Ideas from mathematics have been used as inspiration for fiber arts including quilt making , knitting , cross-stitch , crochet , embroidery and weaving . A wide range of mathematical concepts have been used as inspiration including topology , graph theory , number theory and algebra . Some techniques such as counted-thread embroidery are naturally geometrical ; other kinds of textile provide a ready means for the colorful physical expression of mathematical concepts .

Quilting [ edit ] Main article: quilt The IEEE Spectrum has organized a number of competitions on quilt block design, and several books have been published on the subject. Notable quiltmakers include Diana Venters and Elaine Ellison, who have written a book on the subject Mathematical Quilts: No Sewing Required . Examples of mathematical ideas used in the book as the basis of a quilt include the golden rectangle , conic sections , Leonardo da Vinci 's Claw, the Koch curve , the Clifford torus , San Gaku , Mascheroni 's cardioid , Pythagorean triples , spidrons , and the six trigonometric functions .

[ 1 ] Knitting and crochet [ edit ] Cross-stitch counted-thread embroidery Knitted mathematical objects include the Platonic solids , Klein bottles and Boy's surface .
The Lorenz manifold and the hyperbolic plane have been crafted using crochet.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] Knitted and crocheted tori have also been constructed depicting toroidal embeddings of the complete graph K 7 and of the Heawood graph .

[ 4 ] The crocheting of hyperbolic planes has been popularized by the Institute For Figuring ; a book by Daina Taimina on the subject, Crocheting Adventures with Hyperbolic Planes , won the 2009 Bookseller/Diagram Prize for Oddest Title of the Year .

[ 5 ] Embroidery [ edit ] Two Bargello patterns Embroidery techniques such as counted-thread embroidery [ 6 ] including cross-stitch and some canvas work methods such as Bargello make use of the natural pixels of the weave, lending themselves to geometric designs.

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] Weaving [ edit ] Ada Dietz (1882 – 1981) was an American weaver best known for her 1949 monograph Algebraic Expressions in Handwoven Textiles , which defines weaving patterns based on the expansion of multivariate polynomials .

[ 9 ] J. C. P. Miller ( 1970 ) used the Rule 90 cellular automaton to design tapestries depicting both trees and abstract patterns of triangles.

[ 10 ] Spinning [ edit ] Margaret Greig was a mathematician who articulated the mathematics of worsted spinning .

[ 11 ] Fashion design [ edit ] The silk scarves from DMCK Designs' 2013 collection are all based on Douglas McKenna's space-filling curve patterns.

[ 12 ] The designs are either generalized Peano curves, or based on a new space-filling construction technique.

[ 13 ] [ 14 ] The Issey Miyake Fall-Winter 2010–2011 ready-to-wear collection  designs from a collaboration between fashion designer Dai Fujiwara and mathematician William Thurston . The designs were inspired by Thurston's geometrization conjecture , the statement that every 3-manifold can be decomposed into pieces with one of eight different uniform geometries, a proof of which had been sketched in 2003 by Grigori Perelman as part of his proof of the Poincaré conjecture .
