Arc welders need to protect themselves from welding sparks , which are heated metal particles that fly off the welding surface.

In the physical sciences , a particle (or corpuscle in older texts) is a small localized object which can be described by several physical or chemical properties , such as volume , density , or mass .

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] They vary greatly in size or quantity, from subatomic particles like the electron , to microscopic particles like atoms and molecules , to macroscopic particles like powders and other granular materials . Particles can also be used to create scientific models of even larger objects depending on their density, such as humans moving in a crowd or celestial bodies in motion .

The term particle is rather general in meaning, and is refined as needed by various scientific fields. Anything that is composed of particles may be referred to as being particulate.

[ 3 ] However, the noun particulate is most frequently used to refer to pollutants in the Earth's atmosphere , which are a suspension of unconnected particles, rather than a connected particle aggregation .

Conceptual properties [ edit ] Particles are often represented as dots. This figure could represent the movement of atoms in a gas , people in crowds or stars in the night sky .

The concept of particles is especially useful when modelling nature , as the full treatment of many phenomena can be complex and also involve difficult computation.

[ 4 ] It can be used to make simplifying assumptions concerning the processes involved.

Francis Sears and Mark Zemansky , in University Physics , give the example of calculating the landing location and speed of a baseball thrown in the air. They gradually strip the baseball of most of its properties, by first idealizing it as a rigid smooth sphere , then by neglecting rotation , buoyancy and friction , ultimately reducing the problem to the ballistics of a classical point particle .

[ 5 ] The treatment of large numbers of particles is the realm of statistical physics .

[ 6 ] Size [ edit ] Galaxies are so large that stars can be considered particles relative to them.

See also: Particle size The term "particle" is usually applied differently to three classes of sizes. The term macroscopic particle , usually refers to particles much larger than atoms and molecules . These are usually abstracted as point-like particles , even though they have volumes, shapes, structures, etc. Examples of macroscopic particles would include powder , dust , sand , pieces of debris during a car accident , or even objects as big as the stars of a galaxy .

[ 7 ] [ 8 ] Another type, microscopic particles usually refers to particles of sizes ranging from atoms to molecules , such as carbon dioxide , nanoparticles , and colloidal particles . These particles are studied in chemistry , as well as atomic and molecular physics .

The smallest particles are the subatomic particles , which refer to particles smaller than atoms.

[ 9 ] These would include particles such as the constituents of atoms – protons , neutrons , and electrons – as well as other types of particles which can only be produced in particle accelerators or cosmic rays . These particles are studied in particle physics .

Because of their extremely small size, the study of microscopic and subatomic particles falls in the realm of quantum mechanics . They will exhibit phenomena demonstrated in the particle in a box model, [ 10 ] [ 11 ] including wave–particle duality , [ 12 ] [ 13 ] and whether particles can be considered distinct or identical [ 14 ] [ 15 ] is an important question in many situations.

Composition [ edit ] A proton is composed of three quarks and held together with the strong interaction .

Particles can also be classified according to composition.

Composite particles refer to particles that have composition – that is particles which are made of other particles.

[ 16 ] For example, a carbon-14 atom is made of six protons, eight neutrons, and six electrons. By contrast, elementary particles (also called fundamental particles ) refer to particles that are not made of other particles.

[ 17 ] According to our current understanding of the world , only a very small number of these exist, such as leptons , quarks , and gluons . However it is possible that some of these might be composite particles after all , and merely appear to be elementary to scientists now.

[ 18 ] While composite particles can very often be considered point-like , although having internal structure, elementary particles have so far been found to have no structure.

[ 19 ] Stability [ edit ] Both elementary (such as muons ) and composite particles (such as uranium nuclei ), are known to undergo particle decay . Those that do not are called stable particles, such as the electron or a helium-4 nucleus . The lifetime of stable particles can be either infinite or large enough to hinder attempts to observe such decays. In the latter case, those particles are called " observationally stable ". In general, a particle decays from a high- energy state to a lower-energy state by emitting some form of radiation , such as the emission of photons .

N -body simulation [ edit ] Main article: N-body simulation In computational physics , N -body simulations (also called N -particle simulations) are simulations of dynamical systems of particles under the influence of certain conditions, such as being subject to gravity .

[ 20 ] These simulations are common in cosmology and computational fluid dynamics .

N refers to the number of particles considered. As simulations with higher N are more computationally intensive, systems with large numbers of actual particles will often be approximated to a smaller number of particles, and simulation algorithms need to be optimized through various methods .

[ 20 ] Distribution of particles [ edit ] Main article: Colloid Examples of a stable and of an unstable colloidal dispersion.

Colloidal particles are the components of a colloid. A colloid is a substance microscopically dispersed evenly throughout another substance.

[ 21 ] Such colloidal system can be solid , liquid , or gaseous ; as well as continuous or dispersed. The dispersed-phase particles have a diameter of between approximately 5 and 200 nanometers .

[ 22 ] Soluble particles smaller than this will form a solution as opposed to a colloid. Colloidal systems (also called colloidal solutions or colloidal suspensions) are the subject of interface and colloid science .

Suspended solids may be held in a liquid, while solid or liquid particles suspended in a gas together form an aerosol . Particles may also be suspended in the form of atmospheric particulate matter , which may constitute air pollution . Larger particles can similarly form marine debris or space debris . A conglomeration of discrete solid, macroscopic particles may be described as a granular material .

A body whose rotation is ignored as irrelevant is called a particle. A particle may be so small that it is an approximation to a point, or it may be of any size, provided that the action lines of all the forces acting on it intersect in one point.
